RATING: 6
An excellent attempt at a 'hybrid' game that builds up quickly and gets into the meat of it straight from the off and the power tiles are really interesting but the heavy reliance on turn order (i.e. going last) is just a little too important for my liking

RATING: 8.5
Need to get this one to the table more.  It should play really quickly and is a blast.  If you are not confrontational and let people hang out in 2+ temples that game can end pretty quickly.  People left me alone and I came out on top.  Have preordered the expansion. :D

First play fell a little flat, would like to give this another try. Good dudes-on-a-map game where fighting is strongly encouraged and nowhere is safe. An all-you-can-eat buffet of tech options which currently feels a bit overwhelming; I expect further plays will help but it can leave new players a little lost

I had been dying to play this for a while and, while it was good, it didn't quite live up to my expectations.  The first half of the game was really fun, especially building up the power tiles, but I found the end of the game to be somewhat repetitive and anticlimactic.  Still a good game that I'd like to play again.

RATING: 7.5
I liked it. For a slam into your friend with fury in your eye, it is a bunch of fun. The miniatures in this game are amazing! Very asymmetrical as it unfolds and this bring replay value as you explore the various power-ups available. Very happy to have this one available for play.  Only take away is the large area needed to display the tiles in the market - bummer on set up as well here. Still, it is my go-to game for dudes on a map that plays in about 45-60 minutes.

Kemet is a race turning into a tug war later. Player order of prime importance. In the early game you want to be the first to buy the power ups, whereas later you want to be the last to move your armies.

Powering up is great fun, especially if you get the monsters on the board. The tug war part is not so much fun because you are just attacking the weakest army on the board in order to ensure your victory and to secure the victory point you get from winning a battle. 

If only the battle system was a bit more exciting and if weak armies would also have a chance, even a small one, would Kemet be a very good game. Now it is just an average multiplayer tactical skirmish. Long term strategy plays a less important role, too.

RATING: 6
It's ok.  Perfectly playable and quite fun.  Definitely large on chrome and not massively high on strategy, but it passes along reasonably quickly and has a fair degree of tension.  There seems to be a craze for games with lots of cards in them - where you upgrade or by pwers having first built something to improve them - this has lots of that.  At first it can be difficult to get a grip on that, and certainly some power combinations seem very powerful - but you soon learn.

I have liked the gameplay in 4 player game. Very alert,you need to compensate rapidly for the power tiles you would have loved to buy, but the other players have purchased them first.
the 3 player game was fine. In a 2 player game the pace is slower, each player reacts to his opponet's move, it looked more like lying in wait for any  mistake your adversary might make. it is my oppinion that a 2 player game is longer than a 3-4 player game. After just 3 plays I want to get better at this and try a 5 player game.

2 player variant suprisingly good. A bit hard to teach new people as they have to study all the power tiles (After some practice this is not as bad but people still have to refer to manual a lot for the tiles).

Very tactical rather than strategic so pretty easy for casuals to pick up. In fact my casual friends liked it a lot more than my core gamer friends who found it dull.

This game would be significantly better if the instruction book was a bit more detailed, and the book that tells you what each power card does wasn't in 10 different languages with no index.  It's not a bad game, but the potential for AP, plus the time it takes to figure out what power card does what really drags the gameplay down.  This game needs a second edition with significant refinements.

RATING: 8.5
To put it simply: if you are looking for a dudes on a map game where battling is fast and furious, turtling will lose you the game, components are fantastic and playtime is short... There is no better game than this one. 

The vast array of upgrades should eliminate any concerns about replayability. What a fun game. 

The only knock against would be the initially overwhelming amount of upgrade tiles. Doesn't take long to figure them out though, so not a huge deal.

I was very excited when I bought this game. I liked so many things about it: its light war-game nature, the Egyptian mythology theme, the tech-tree that allows you to personalize your faction, the giant monsters following you in battle. Then I played it a few time and the game left me with the strange feeling of a shallow game-play. I felt like every play would be the same, as during the first few turns everyone buys up technologies just to then start teleporting all over the place, targeting the weakest spot to get easy points and conquering temples. It was terribly monotonous.

That made me sad. I hated the teleporting rule and even more the huge impact of the turn order on the entire thing. I never really disliked the game, but I thought it wasn't designed well enough. So I played it a few times, rated it a 5, sold my copy and forgot about it. Almost two years later, I had the opportunity to play it again and I wanted to give it another chance. So it happened that I changed my mind, at least a little bit.

While I still don't love this game as much as many others  here on BGG do, I had a lot of fun. I enjoyed the challenge that the game was able to provide me, the tension and the need to time your actions perfectly to get what you want. I liked to build combos with the technology tiles and personalize my strategy. At the same time though I still think that the teleporting rule is stupid and that the turn order is too relevant. I also still think that every game will start exactly the same with players buying technology tiles as much as possible. And I have another complaint, that only I seem to have with Kemet: while in general the artwork is really well done, I don't like how the board looks like and that definitively lowers my enjoyment of the game and consequently my rating.

Therefore, after so many twists and turns in my opinions, I must say that I enjoy Kemet quite a bit, but I would enjoy it more if the game would have been a little different in some of its aspects. At least though I now understand why people like it so much, even if I don't necessarily agree on everything. Kemet is a pretty good game. I like it!

Total confrontation game in which tactics surpas strategy. It does this really well preventing some of the problems commonly associated with this type of games. I like it and I would like to play it more often, but it seems that I am the only one in my gaming group with this positive opinion.

RATING: 8
FAVOURITE GAME - each player deploys the troops of an Egyptian tribe and uses the mystical powers of the gods of ancient Egypt – along with their powerful armies – to score points in glorious battles or through invasion of rich territories. A game is typically played to 8 or 10 victory points, which may be accrued through winning attacks, controlling temples, controlling fully-developed pyramids, sacrificing to the gods, and wielding particular magical powers. It is a fast paced strategy/wargame, where the emphasis is on direct combat. Building up the defenses will only make you lose. The artwork is great, the rules easy to grasp and it doesn`t take ages to play as similar games do.

I like the art design of the map, I like the way the game encourages attacking and the distances are all balanced. I like the game feels very fast and cool special powers. 

The huge variety of power cards to reference and look up is a lot of work. I think if I played this a lot I would like it better than a 7 but with the frequency I'll end up playing it, the variety of powers slows the game down more than I'd like.

I enjoyed this battle/area control game, it is simple, fast and have lots of possibilities of combos and strategies. The components and art are great, too. The race aspect for the most victory points are not what I appreciate most in games, but in area control games it works fine and you can somehow plan a very great move and make it impossible to revert the situation. The permanent and temporary VPs work fine to not make the game so long in a way that a winning player could be attacked and loose to many VPs. Great game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Need a few more plays to rate this one definitively.

Early impressions:
I really want to love this game! However, for me it feels too Euro, although it does a great job to hide that from people: nice artwork, theme connected to game mechanics, a few of the best-looking miniatures I have ever seen in a game... when played, it's Euro all the way. Not that Euro is a bad thing, but it could have opted for a little more 'feel' instead of 'if you add this number and it's higher than his number you win'.
For instance the board looks cool. It's great design creating the spaces as they are: every city at exactly the same distance as everything else... But I don't want that, I want a game to be intuitive, I want to 'see' and 'feel' they are the same distance, not 'accept they are the same distance because the same number of lines run between them'.

Theme (artwork/story/...)
1/2
Gameplay (smooth play/player interaction/strategy&tactics/depth)
5/5
Fun factor (can you afford a smile during play?)
1.5/3

RATING: 7
Feels like a knife fight with four other people in a lift.

It's a pretty simple game that depends on majority on numbers and card play to win. It's a pretty good system that beats dice rolling randomness.

The tiles to boost certain advantage too is a good add on. But I do feel that the 'I bought it you can't have it' idea on the lame side. There will always be certain tiles that are more advantages than the others. It's a matter of circumstances or player interaction, that these circumstances would make other tiles seem just as useful. 

In games where no ones knows each other, the game becomes a killer instinct session with no holds barred. Useful tiles will be the first to go to the lucky chap that gets to decide who goes first. The advantage of going last is only apparent importance near the last 2-3 VP snatch moment.

Good fighting game. No story to tell. Just gather the strongest number and do the necessary. Fight a minor battle to get rid of cards and take back the important ones.

Jeu de guerre sous thème Égyptien. Il y a beaucoup de pouvoirs différents alors les combinaisons prises par les joueurs se rarement les même d'une partie a l'autre. Par contre, c'est plutôt rare de voir des troupes se déplacer sur la carte. Habituellement, les armées atterrissent près des monolithes et restent la. Ils vont se promener sur la carte uniquement pour atteindre les pyramides adverses.

This is an absolutely beautiful and superb game. With only a few minor glitches on cards, Kemet sports one of the highest component qualities I've ever seen in a game. The gameplay itself is highly strategic and requires really having a future game plan that's semi flexible. The plastic models are all very cool and each army is different looking. Play remains symmetrical, though the balance in the game is superb enough that it never gets boring. There isn't a single bad thing you can say about this game.

There's a small feast of options to make Kemet an asynchronous tactical slugfest. Teching up is fun. Combat is bloody and fast. 

Unfortunately, the balance is a tiny bit wonky. I vastly prefer the 10 point game to the 8 point game. But those two points also significantly extend the length of the game. Kemet would be firing on all gears if it nailed the balance between ideal length and strategy.

Kemet is a very good option for a hybrid Euro-Thematic knife fight. The wonky balance of length and choices holds it back the most for me.

One of the best dudes-on-a-map games of recent age: aggressive and easy to learn, with tons of options to buff your armies and a huge amount of table-talk and general murdering.

RATING: 7
Kemet is reminiscent of Nexus Ops in that it is a low complexity conflict game whose scoring system actively encourages aggressive play.  The Sanctuary of All Gods is not quite the focal point that is Nexus' monolith, but it's close.

In Kemet three sets of power tiles aligned to different deities are at the heart of the game.  Of course you'll want the ones that bring mythical monster miniatures, but it's fun to experiment with different combinations to give your forces an edge.  The battle cards ask some quite interesting questions about your appetite to inflict losses and preparedness to take some.  Kemet allows you to leader bash, weakling bash and kingmake.  For my taste only the last of those is a significant demerit.  Overall, it's a fun game.

Production quality is good.  The monsters aren't quite on the monstrous  scale of Cyclades, but they're still handsomely done.  The soldier miniatures are less impressive.  The board is ugly, but functional.  The box is a gaudy delight; it doesn't so much stand out on the shelf as leap off it with a wild cry.

Good area control game. Great production values, similar to Cyclades. Easy to teach and play. I like the simple combat system with minor bluffing elements, reminds me of Game of Thrones.

Kemet is bloody fun and it takes around 1 to 2 hours depending the number of players.

RATING: 8
Pros:
- Amazing Quality & Beautiful Miniatures - Feels Bad Ass to command the Legendary Creatures.
- Extremely fast playing (90 minutes or less!)area control game that rewards attacking & discourages turtling (you will lose if you try to turtle).
- Great Card Combat Mechanics make for exciting diceless battles.
- Prayer Resource & Action Management felt appropriate and well developed.

Cons:
- Perhaps too many Power Tile upgrades for your faction, could benefit from fewer choices to speed play and make tiles more equally beneficial.
- Has a bit of a problem with Kingmaking towards end, as players can attack weakened armies after they get out of a battle for cheap easy VPs. Rewards reactionary/opportunistic game play to a fault.
- Some Power Tile Upgrades are far better than others (extra actions, teleports, cost reductions)
- Rulebook requires 2-3 read through, you can miss a few things. Like you cannot have 2 power tiles of the same name, no matter what, not even of different colors. (we played wrong for a bit)

Plays best with 4-5 players. 
Player who makes best tile purchases, wins most battles, and manages their actions best wins!

We played last night at Rugby on Board. This is pure Eurotrash, (mostly Trash) with a smattering of civ building. It annoyed me in the same way Cyclades did - a semi-random end game which relies upon everyone knowing who is in a position to win, then stopping them. The problem comes that when you attack somebody to prevent the win, you are making it easier for another player to swoop in and take the victory. 

There are also multiple choices available from the start which combined with 5 actions a round, will cripple some AP prone players. 

On the plus side, there is a lot of game there for a relatively short play time. It feels a bit like Nexus Ops crossed with Game of Thrones with a few elements of Through the Ages thrown in. 

I like that it rewards attacking (you get a point for winning a battle - 8 wins the game).

It is a leader in its class - light but meaty battle-focused area control game playable in under two hours [maybe Chaos in the Old World?]

It has less dodgy combos than Cyclades....

Another 'advantage' over Cyclades is that the rather nicely sculpted minis stay on the board rather than disappear into the ether after a turn.

Kemet is a great looking thematic game filled with many strategical and tactical decisions in every moment within the game. No-luck gameplay (except for card draw) and the almost symmetrical starting positions (except a minor difference between the opposite sides of Nile for the 5p game) enhance the amount of enjoyment taken out of Kemet.

Playing music from "Pharaoh" and "Children of the Nile" video game soundtracks greatly enhance the atmosphere and I recommend it.

Many thanks to Andrew for playing with us. He brought new ideas during game design and just is a great board game player.

11-16-2013 Update for Santa:

10 Things We Like About Kemet:
1) Plays well with two -- one of our core criteria
2) Plays well with more -- nice to have! 
3) Pretty. (Minis, board, tiles.)
4) Easy to learn
5) Good depth to time spent ratio. An hour for two feels satisfying.
6) Mechanics feel streamlined and slick. Mechanics flow nicely together, and it's easy to teach and understand. Things feel like they make a lot of sense! Light on luck -- you control your destiny.
7) Enjoyable and logical victory conditions! (You win when you attack more, and attacking more is fun.)
8) Easy to get people to play. Looks exciting. Cool factor. 
9) Each game feels very different. 
10) Direct interaction - gobs of it.  

---

Super fun. Each game is very different, and it is fun to explore new power tile combos. I've played this mostly as 2 player, so as long as we actively explore new strategies, we don't get stuck in a rut. Mechanics are tight and feel streamlined. 

Games always feel close. Plays fairly quick as 2 player, but a pain to set up (good thing we can keep it on the table and would want to play several times before cleaning it up).

This game is so close to being great, but ends up falling flat for me. The amazing upgrade tracks, the little pyramids, the miniatures, all of these things are splendid and enticing. But the combat system does not work. Because everything is connected whoever attacks first is then attacked by the next player, who is then attacked by the next player, until the round is over. Troops are immediately replenished, and it goes on like that until someone wins. This is very unsatisfying.

Rating increased after initial plays. This game provides so many, yet perfectly balanced, different viable strategies to win. Amazing. It really is a very simple game, rules-wise, but in every round there are so many options and hard decisions to be made. Probably plays best with 4, but 3 and 5 player games are great. Havent tried 2 player game yet.

Components are good but the monster miniatures are a stand out.
The tech tree is really cool with so many different choices that you can develop your strategy around.
Attacking is encouraged right from turn one.
Needs player aids for the tech tiles.
Would prefer dice for combat but the cards work.

10/7/17: Plays well with 5 and doesn't bog down.  However it's one of those games that rewards attacking.  I do feel that I have much more control and decision making than Cyclades.

There is a large technology tree, so much so that some people might find it daunting at the start.  Don't worry about knowing everything, and just start playing.

Interesting area control/worker placement game. Kind of a euro management/worker placement to manage a war game.

This game seems deep. Really deep. I almost wonder if it's _too_ deep, you know? There's SO MUCH decision making, that  you're just bombarded with it from the outset. It also is VERY swingy.

All that said, the components are top notch. They spared no expense on that.

Such a relentlessly aggressive game. It's like having a pet wolverine. It's snarling and thrashing around, and eager to take a finger or two, but it's so loveable for it. Combines the tech tree of Eclipse with the general area control of Game of Thrones, and it's done in an hour. Brilliant.

The best "dudes on a map" game I've ever played. The power tiles really bring in a completely fresh feel on an otherwise tried-and-true mechanism, and the facts that there just are so few spaces, and that you can get some serious VPs by just attacking and winning battles make for a very close game.

Also, you can just hire reinforcements very easily, so you're guaranteed there's always an interesting battle just around the corner.

The components are also one of the nicest ones I've ever seen.

Great game.

I don't like the unintended "fog of war" that results from having to remember all of the abilities and combos others have with the various tiles they've squirreled away. While it is a common problem in many games of this ilk, I admit it's not supremely egregious here.  However, if your play frequency is less than that of others at your table, you will always be at a disadvantage.  So the question comes down to, do you want to memorize all of the tile abilities or not?  I've made my choice.

RATING: 8
Bár nem olyan forradalmi játék, mint amire a vélemények, képek, szabályolvasás után számítottam, de összességében tetszett. Sajnos nehéz elvonatkoztatni attól, hogy az asztalunknál nagyon lesújtó vélemények is születtek (a többségnek nem jött be a játék különböző okokból), és volt aki ennek folyamatosan hangot is adott a játék során, ez egyértelműen kihatással volt azoknak az élményére is, akiknek alapból tetszett. A negatív vélemények címszavakban: "úgy ahogy van nem az én játékom, konfrontatív, és csúnya a tábla"; "túl sok a holtidő"; "királycsinálás". Mi, akik pozitív véleményen voltunk, egyedinek és változatosnak éreztük, sok benne az új ötlet. A konfrontatív jelleg tényleg nagyon erősen megvan benne, de cserébe rövid a játék. A sok holtidő csak akkor van benne, ha valaki sokat agyal a játékon, de normál esetben egy akciókör simán lemegy pár perc alatt. A királycsinálás igaz. A csúnya tábla: nos a nagy tábla tényleg nem szépségdíjas, de az egyéb játékelemek, így a kis táblák is ízlésesek. Összességében inkább mutatós a játék, mint csúnya. Szerintem.
A sok lapka nagyon változatossá teszi a játékot, az akcióválasztás mechanizmusa elegáns, a 7 egyedi lény némi hangulatot is kölcsönöz az egésznek. Az egyiptomi téma szerintem egész tűrhetően átjön. A mozgási mechanizmus, a térkép felépítése és a pontozási rendszer (templomok díjazása) a játékba kódolja a konfliktust. A győzelmi pontok típusait nehéz elsőre átlátni, vannak fix és elveszthető pontok is, pont ez ad a játéknak egy konfliktusos lüktetést, egymás piramisait és a templomokat folyamatosan veszik el egymástól a játékosok, mert az azokért járó pontok nem véglegesek.
Elsőre hibásan játszottunk néhány dolgot. A FAQ elég vaskos, sajnos nem minden derül ki a szabályból (pl. teleport kártya). Szerencsére az ikonrendszer jó, egy parti után szinte minden lapka és kártya jelentése egyértelmű. Összességében ajánlom mindenkinek, aki gyors harci jellegű játékra vágyik. De leszögezem, hogy (szerintem) távolról sem wargame-ről van szó. Kb. annyira harci, mint a Shogun, csak ez színesebb, viszont kevésbé letisztult, kevésbé kiugró. De nem rossz!!!
---
Nagyon nem mindegy, kivel játszik az ember. A második próbára nagy sikere volt a játéknak, ez az én játékélményemet is javította. Nagyon nagy újrajátszási lehetőség van benne szerintünk a sok lapka miatt, rengeteg nyerési utat sejtünk benne. Most már jól látszik a 3 szín jellege: piros lapkák = támadó, kék lapkák = védő, fehér lapkák = erőforrás. Ami furcsa, hogy a páros létszámok esetén nincs a pályán szentély.

Egyik 3 fős rövid parti 40 perc alatt lement!
---
Azért egy hosszú parti el tud nyúlni... 5 parti után eddig mindig más stratégia volt a nyerő. Nagyon sokféle lapkakombót össze lehet állítani, folyamatosan jövünk rá az egyre jobbakra. Néhány lapkával megjártuk már, mert a jó ikonozás ellenére is van néhány kérdés, ami a szabályban nincs benne, csak a játék közben derült ki. Elég széleskörű faq van egyébként a játékhoz. Még egy dolog: nagyon nehéz megbecsülni, hogy kit kell ütni, épp ki áll jól, mivel a vége felé egy körben akár 3-4 pont is szerezhető.
---
Már vagy 10-15 nagyon különböző lapkakombót kipróbáltunk. Az új kedvencem az, amihez nem kell felhúzni 4-esre egy piramist se, így nem kell nagyon őrizni a várost: Charge!+Blades of Neith+Defense!+Legion+God Speed... plusz még néhány egyéb lapka is hozzácsapható, meg persze pár kreatúra, ezzel rengeteg harci GYP szerezhető így, és nem is nagy a költsége. 2 hely tartósan tartható a 6+6 emberrel, mivel minden seregnek +2 ütőereje van.
---
Kieggel is kipróbáltuk, nagyon jó úgy is, még változatosabb. De miért csak 7 pontot adtam én erre a játékra?? Felpontoztam 8-ra, de még a 9 se kizárt!
---
Hihetetlen jó ez a játék, de kipróbáltuk úgy, hogy minden kieget használtunk, és így én már egyszerűen elveszek a sok lehetőségben, nem tudok jó kombót összehozni:) Kipróbáltam a 2 bekezdéssel ezelőtt említett kombót, ami az alapjátékban működött, de itt már annyi plusz dolog bejön, hogy semmire se mentem vele. Sokkal több szörny van már az olcsók közt is, megjelenik az 5-ös támadólap, zsoldosok, plusz a Ta-Seti úton nagyon sok módosítóhoz hozzájuthatunk, megjelennek pl. a papok is, szerintem így nagyon nehéz tuti kombót találni, ami persze a játékot dicséri. Végtelen lehetőség van, nem is tudom, van-e másik játék, ahol ennyire ezt éreztem. És a hatalomlapka készlet mindig teljesen nyilvános, tehát nem attól változatos, hogy mindig más készlettel játszunk, hanem hogy mindig mást veszünk meg, olyan rohadt sok van és annyira sok jó.
A vége nagyon izgalmas tud lenni, bár ezt nem mindig tükrözi a számszerű eredmény. Van olyan, hogy egy körrel a vége előtt nem érezzük, kit kéne ütni, mert látszólag azonos esélye van több embernek is a győzelemre, de lehet hogy a végén az egyikük simán 4-5 ponttal nyer, ami 10-12 pont körüli eredményeknél nagyon sok. Nagyon dinamikusan változik az eredmény, annyi féle győzelmi pont lehet. Sokan kritizálták a játékot a királycsinálás miatt, nos szerintem a fentiek miatt ez ritkán jön elő, pedig mi 3-an játsszuk. Az alapjátékban csomó holtverseny volt, ahol csak a katonai győzelmek döntöttek, a kiegek viszont eddig mindig sima győzelmet hoztak, ha valaki jól fordul rá a végjátékra, lehet hogy már ketten is hiába ütjük. És ezt nagyon nehéz időben felismerni.

A perfectly good example of a "eurotrash" game - a genre just between euro and ameritrash games. Reminded me in that way of Cyclades, although they share little in common mechanics-wise.
It is a perfectly good game, I loved the tile ability-drafting system. However it forces you to conflict a lot more than Cyclades, which is not my cup of tea. Still a great game, with overproduced components.

Great area control game, with an innovative combat system. Choosing the right cards to defend your units, wound other units, or try to win the battle. Combat is so heavily encouraged and there is no turtling possible. On top of that it has giant d4s to represent the pyramids, and awesome miniatures, which represent the monsters you can recruit to fight along side your armies. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Kemet is a gorgeous game: the miniatures are wonderful (different molds have been used for the different armies!), and the illustrations and graphic design are at the same high standard.

Kemet is also an unusual game: it is a crossover of euro and ameritrash, with lots (and I mean lots) of aggression, but also some resource management and power development. There is some luck (in the Divine Intervention cards draw), but the combat system is luckless (with a card system reminiscent of A Game of Thrones).

The rules encourage attacking (and penalize turtling) with a clever mix of temporary (bond to the locations) and permanent victory points, together with easy rules for quick movement.

I am quite fascinated by the design, and I am eager to play it again!

A wonderful, tactical and strategic game with stunning components.

Need to play a good few more times to truly appreciate it, but have already put Blood Rage up for sale based on first two games of this.

I actually think the minis in this are better than Blood Rage as because they are smaller they give the game a more grandiose scale.

RATING: 7
Initial Impression: This is a wonderfully produced game along the same lines as Cyclades. The game is mostly combat oriented with limited tactical depth. Combat is enhanced by cards where the player can emphasize strength, damage, or defense. However the upgrade system is where the game really shines and adds depth. Almost all unit abilities are upgradeable and some upgrades can add new abilities to units. It seems as if this game will shine with more than 2 players.

Ostensibly a war game, but combines elements of worker placement and diceless combat.  It all blends together to make a very elegant experience that plays out nice and quickly and has some decent variety with the 48 different 'powers' and interesting concepts like the divine intervention cards.

I'm not a fan of most wargames, but there is enough blending of other elements to make this a great experience.  I look forward to playing more!

I enjoy this game a lot. It is a light, area control game merged with action selection/worker placement type mechanisms. Honestly, buying the power tiles is really where the game shines. There are several different strategies to pursue. The game really goes at a fast pace as well since it encourages you to attack. I really like how the battles are resolved, keeping dice out of it. The expansion adds a fourth color and more tiles. The abundance of options is outstanding. I always like it when a game that uses a map provides different ones for various player counts.

Game with lots of potential but unsatisfying end game.  To prevent players from simply "swooping in from behind" and gaining a huge benefit from going last on the last turn, try out the following variant:


*** POSSIBLY JUST TRY ONLY ALLOWING ONE TELEPORTATION PER MOVE, AND THAT'S IT. ***


This variant doesn't substantially help the end game IMO.  I want to like this game, a lot, but argh!  Not sure if it will ever hit the table again.

*** If a player starts his turn with 8 VP and no other player has more VP than that player he wins the game. 

This player must have the most victory points.  This check occurs during the player's FIRST action after the Night phase.

Additionally, silver and gold actions occur simultaneously.  So a given troop cannot be moved twice via two tokens during the player's action phase.

Finally, during a given action a troop can only teleport once.***

8 VP is used because this variant will generally add a round or two to the game.

Great combination of area control and simple combat. Building up to big power ups is great. Also the victory point for winning attacks leads to less turtle in and more action. The board design is very interesting with everyone being able to get to everything equally well.

My only possible negative is that it would be cool to have more of an asymmetrical start but this is incredibly minor as everyone starts looking different once they get tiles. 

All in all this game is excellent and I'm curious as to what the expansion adds.

As an attempt at making a crossover between Euro and American playstyles, Kemet manages to be a very enjoyable game, though leaning just a bit too much towards its Euro side than the other one: miniatures are very nice indeed but, as the game plays and feels, they could be easily replaced by wooden cubes, since the theme’s overall impact on the game is minimal.

Anyhow, Kemet still doesn’t win me over completely as in my opinion it has one big flaw: unlike Cyclades, its replayability is very limited, since the only working strategy is bashing the other players - even better, the leader, just to make sure - while no random occurences happen to make things harder, unpredictable or simply different from game to game, these being dice rolls, events restrictions or reinforcement cards like Cosmic Encounter’s.
You only have to fight the other players over and over, get as many points as you can and buy the best upgrades (always the same ones, mind you) you can get before your opponents do the same.

Sure, I have a good fun whenever I play Kemet, nonetheless I can’t but think it’s still a half-successful attempt at making an interactive eurogame: how it is now, it’s just an euro that scrapped its resource-management while trying to disguise itself as a thematic game.

Interesting area control game with special powers.  The power tiles are kind of annoying since they are language independent, but the monster mini's are neat.  Has that nexus ops "thing" where you get into the action quickly which is nice.  Interested to see how the game plays at different player counts, as well has how it plays with the different modules from the expansion(s).

Kemet feels like beefed up version of Nexus Ops with a beautiful coat of Egyptian paint.  Like Nexus Ops, the game is all about being the aggressor.  Where the two games differ is that Kemet offers a Tech Tree with lots of choices, an interesting card based combat system and turns are handled with one action at a time.  It's sort of overwhelming at first, but once you settle in and figure how the game is meant to be played it's very interesting.  So if you ever thought that Nexus Ops didn't have enough meat on it's bones then Kemet is exactly what you're looking for.

Finally got a play in of Kemet.  Pretty fun.  Tense decisions.  Not sure if I just don't enjoy area control too much, but I didn't want to play it again immediately, even though I liked it.  Initial rating is a 7.5.  That very well may change.  Its a "better" game than a 7.5 I think, but this is based on my enjoyment...

I love that this is a "race to VP" and rewards tactical combat instead of just marching troops all over a map.  The tech tree is PERFECT in this game.  SO many good options!  BUT, if you spend too much energy just pursuing tech, you'll lose the VP race.  There are definitely some early techs that are better than others so the random first turn order is a little harsh, but I believe there are enough good first turn techs that all players still get something powerful that works to counterbalance the other player's first turn techs.  I really, really like this game!

This is a preliminary rating of seven. The components and theme are terrific and the gameplay is pretty streamlined mechanically. A problem is that there are so many choices that AP can result; of a great a great many choices there are still left too many good choices meaning that one's ultimate decision isn't meaningful enough, perhaps. I love the idea of building the combat engine but the game seems to end too soon to make satisfactory use of the engines. So far, it's not as good as Cyclades with the Hades module from the expansion. Still, I need more plays to evaluate this fairly.

Played twice now, once with the Ta Seti expansion. 
This is a really clever game. Slowly building your strategy, buying power cards and creatures, deploying forces, battling opponents, During the game the forces on the map have an eb and flow feel over them. To win, you really need to take your moment and peak at the right time. Good stuff. And it looks nice too!

A great plus is that the rulebook is only 8 pages long. That's impressive for a game with so much going on.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A game that is balanced by every player being able to be everywhere quickly and pile on the leader. Which weakens the strategic layer. You're trying to draw away attention from yourself and prepare for an unstoppable finishing run.
This is good in general, but it just doesn't fit the theme of a wargame. I prefer City of Horror for example (even though it's mechanically weaker), because it has the same tense player interactions, but a fitting theme and knows what it wants to be.

Kemet fails as a wargame, but is still well designed.

Cool light war game euro hybrid.  Takes some plays to get a feel for it and get to know the power cards.  The card based combat is pretty cool and provides some good tension.  The action selection is done in a really elegant worker placement-like way.  Much has been made of the points for attacking and it is a pretty major part of the game since you can't just play defense.  There's also lots of spaces to fight over.  The big variety of power tiles provide some different strategies you can try from the beginning but you have to be adaptable too when things don't go to plan.

RATING: 6
Not a bad Americatrash game with European roots, but I had some issues with it, particularly with the end game.

* Because instigating and winning combat gives the player a permanent victory point combat is far more opportunistic than tactical. Find some weak force, such as one that just got out of a fight, and attack it for the vp.

* Some of the buildings seemed to be a a lot better than others. Free actions? Ignore walls?

* The end game had some issues. There is a huge potential for kingmaking, with the final player having a chance to determine the winner by who he decides to attack. The game also rewards a Risk-style final gambit, striking out to get as many points as possible at the last possible minute. The fact that you can hoard the Divine Intervention cards with no limit contributes to this (I'd limit the hand size to encourage their use).

On the plus side, the game did have some great bits and I like the theme of warring Egyptian gods.

Played with three players. Strategic game with close to no luck.
Very little downtime, maybe only when it comes to buy power tiles.
Can be a lot to read before one buy a tile.

A game where turtling is not a winning concept.
Takes a while to get the right tactical feel to when to do what.
Even after you have been attacked there is no hard feelings.
Because everyone know what is needed to win.

Kemet, like its twin brother Cyclades, just does not click with me. It might sound odd, but to me the experience feels like playing a video game, trying to conquer other players' possessions while buying stuff from a technology tree.

Great first impressions. Having become a fan of Blood Rage, this game is a little bulkier (in a good way) but a bit more chess like in it's moves and countermoves. It's such a fun thematic, bloody epic experience though, like blood rage scaled up from a slug fest to a war. I think the tech tree really makes this game for me, in a similar way that the drafting makes Blood Rage. The possibilities make the game super interesting.

One of the best "dudes on a map" game out there.  The combat system is fantastic.  Do you choose to inflict damage, defend your troops or win the battle?  You can't do all of them ideally.  The game is highly replayable with multiple power tiles to explore.  The map is set up perfectly so that all players temples are equidistant to each other and the other areas you need to control.  The temporary victory points are hotly contested but if you get to wrapped up somebody else might fly under the radar to victory.  This game (more than most others I've played) provides you with a feeling that in order to win you need to out-think and out-maneuver your opponents.

Wow, I feel like this is, thus far, a vastly underated game.  When I opened the box, I definitely got a Cyclades feel.  There's area control, action allocation, offerings to the gods, MONSTERS, and battles.  However, this game blends it all so well to be completely unlike playing Cyclades (which is also one of my favorite games).  This game is fast and encourages lots of mayhem.  There are numerous ways to customize your faction to your style of play.  Battles are a constant and dependable way to gain victory points, however I won our first game via temple control and permanent victory point power tiles.  The combat is card driven, but it's fast and intuitive and allows for interesting outcomes.  The monsters are very fun and add a lot of flavor to the game without being overpowered.  The downsides are three-fold, for our group.  1) The rule book is a little vague on certain aspects of the game; 2) there is a good bit of iconography that you need to learn on the power tiles and divine intervention cards, and 3) just a little fiddly to set up given all the pieces and tiles.  Fantastic game though, if you like battle games.  We all loved it in a four player session.  I look forward to it hitting the table soon.

First time I played was most fun. Second time my friends had played a bunch of times and they all picked white pyramids, blitzed through the victory points, and after a few battles the game was over after four turns.  So either the game has one overwhelmingly dominant strategy or is badly skewed by groupthink.  It's still fun, but will never be above a 7 if all this is true.

Kemet is not one of my favorite games, but it's a great game. The mechanisms are airtight, the combat is good, the tiles are great, the components are top.

First Play with Isaac and Tyyne. Very cool and complex upgrade mechanic over a fairly simple territory game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The main neat thing in Kemet is all of the special abilities you can build up for yourself through the course of the game, and this is really where most of the game lies.  You want to assemble abilities that work well together so you can sync up a strategy revolving around those abilities.  Since each player will get different stuff, each player will be approaching the game a little differently.

However, everything else about the game was rather uninteresting.  It mostly revolves around smashing armies into each other to score points for winning battles, and also to secure places on the board that give you points and income (in the form of "prayer points" which allow you to take actions).

The worst part is probably that this is a "race to X number of points" game, where the scores tend to stay pretty close.  So, the final game round degenerates into a kingmaking type deal where everyone analyzes how many points everyone else has just to try to mess with the players in the lead.  Not an attractive quality in a game to me.

I also dislike the combat system used here, where players have a hand of cards and pick what card they will use.  It attempts to be some sort of bluff/double-bluff exercise, which I hate.  Note that Kemet isn't the only game to use this battle system, but it's a mechanic I really dislike.  In this case, there doesn't really even end up being much of a bluff most of the time, as it is often fairly obvious what each side will do anyways.

Overall, just a pretty blah experience for me.  I could take it or leave it if someone else wanted to play, but I'd rather leave it.

This, for me, is the best of both worlds. I'm generally more of a Euro engine-building/resource-managing kind of gal, but I really love direct conflict. My problem with most combat games is that often the best way to win is to avoid conflict and focus on defense - Kemet turns that entirely on its head... the only way to win is to play for blood.

And, unlike most combat games the strategy here is more in resource management and timing, rather than strategic movement and placement of units. While this may turn off the vein of gamers that grew up playing Risk, Axis & Allies, etc., I think it's an excellent choice for Euro lovers who are looking to add a little conflict to their lives (me!)

The resource game is excellent. You feel limited in every possible way - in actions, in currency, in units, in map space, in cards. You always want to do so much more than you can, and EVERY decision you make matters. You really feel the weight of every decision's importance in this game. Kemet doesn't fuck around.

Then there's the combat. First, this game uses Victory Points very well. I like the difference between temporary and permanent VP and they way both are used to encourage confrontation. I also really dig card-based combat systems, and this is no exception. Deciding which combat card to discard is always agonizing. There's not a whole lot of room for bluff with your cards but there's [i]just[/i] enough to keep you guessing. Good stuff.

The DI cards add just the right amount of luck to the game. Nothing feels overpowered, and they keep things from feeling too deterministic and keep the game feeling fresh over repeated plays.

So that just leaves the big thing, then: the power tiles. Your first game will be a little overwhelming as it's a hell of a lot to internalize, but these are really the heart of the game. Trying to find new and interesting combinations is fun and denying people their tiles feels great. As with all combo-based games (and ESPECIALLY in a open, perfect-information system like this) I worry about replay value - whether or not after enough plays the game will devolve into just trying to be the first to snatch what you know are the game-winning combos, but it will be just [i]so much damned fun[/i] getting to that point that I have no doubts that I will get my money's worth out of this game regardless.

I find it weird that the minis are of two vastly different qualities. The creatures are beautiful and high quality, but the units are a much cheaper plastic. All my catladies came bent. :(

Edit: This is also one of the few dudes on a map game that is really great 2-player.

Kemet is an extremely interesting and different mix of eurogame and ameritrash which works surprisingly well! The publisher, Matagot, has also released Cyclades which can also be said to be a mix of both genres, though it falls more into the eurocamp than Kemet. There are many similarities: the length and weight/difficulty of the games are similar, the production value is perfect (mainly due to the awesome plastic miniatures in both games). However, in terms of mechanics it’s a very different beast than Cyclades, and I think Kemet is a much better game than Cyclades as the latter feel too static and without too much interaction/combat. I’m a die-hard eurogamer myself, but I think Kemet is the better game. Cyclades is, as said, more in the euro-camp and its main mechanic is centered on auction with a limited amount of combat. Kemet, on the other hand, uses an action point allowance system and is extremely focused on combat between the players. 

The combat works well; it’s simple and elegant and it works much better than the die-rolling combats you see in most games including Cyclades. On the other hand there aren’t big differences as to which cards you play, and it felt a little weird that you can win a combat even though you have lost the most units… But that’s just how it works. And it’s extremely clever that you can attack each other right from the start of the game! You’re able to do so because you can teleport from your home to basically the entire map; maybe it’s not thematic, but I don’t care because the game becomes much better and more alive because of this rule! Now you can attack during round 1, and you don’t have to build up a huge army over several rounds before you think you’re strong enough or even are able to reach your opponents… And you cannot even build a huge army as you have only 12 army units available, which is a good idea. Furthermore, the game rewards attacking and not turtling, which is another good call in terms of the overall design and playability of the game!

The way the game is won is superb. I love that you can play to either 8 or 10 points. The first player to get those points is declared the winner, and that’s a nice change of pace compared to all of those games where you count your points after X number of rounds. As points are public knowledge, the game is constantly moving back and forth as players are constantly attacking the leader each round. The game probably lasts for around 90-120 minutes (maybe longer with 5 players and playing the long game), but it definitely ramps up in speed when you know the various power tiles.

Speaking of these power tiles, they are a big part of why I love the game. The fact that once you buy a power tile, you - and you alone! - have that specific power, is something I’m very fond of. There are 3 kind of tiles; the offensive-minded, the defensive-minded and those which focus more on infrastructe/income. All of them are nice to have, and it’s always a tough choice which to choose! I like that every player start with various levels of these three “tech pyramids” as you’re pursuing different strategies. The multitude of cards and power tiles is great.

Of course there are a few things I’m not thrilled about. I don’t like that other players can take control of your pyramids and limit your options. However, this is a minor concern. My biggest concern is that there might be situations where you cannot avoid kingmaking… This was the case in one of my games as the game was very close, and it was very close to be the case in another game as well. That definitely left a sour taste in my mouth, and if I experience any further incidents like this, I think I’ll have to decrease my rating drastically… But for now it’s a great game which I thoroughly enjoy, and I do suspect that kingmaking issues won’t be too much a problem going forth. One last thing negative, and that's a pretty big one I think; going last is a huge benefit, so if the games are close (like they often are), a player going last has a much better chance of winning, even if he is a couple of points behind before that round! That will be fixed in the upcoming expansion, but that is definitely my biggest problem with the game.

Overall I still love Kemet. Everybody is constantly attacking everybody, but you’re not screwed if you lose a combat or two. The power tiles are awesome. The game plays very differently than most other games I own and love. Kemet is a keeper!

RATING: 4
My first game was tricky and slow because the tile options seemed so varied and overwhelming. In reality there's not that much variation and subsequent plays should be faster. This game lets you get into the action from the word, 'Go' as there's no point in turtling. The game rewards attacking but you will rarely be able to hold on to your conquests for long.

Cool gameplay! I really like the little downtime and hard decisions this game has. This game forces you to engage other players and battle for regions. It's not overly complicated, like most other civ games, so it's a nice game to have. There can be some king making in this game, but I think after more plays players would probably get a good sense on how to play and out maneuver opponents.

It is hard to beat Kemet, which I like slightly more than Cyclades.  It has a little of something for everybody.  The rules can be learned quickly, the gameplay is fun and quick, and there is a surprising amount of strategy.  It'll appeal to Euro and war gamers alike.  I think I personally prefer the Game of Thrones Board Game, but Kemet is much easier to learn, plays quicker, and is more accessible.

This game seems a bit heavy and places a high emphasis on attacking.  It's more score points the fastest- but doesn't seem to have a resolution.  In my opinion, it isn't worth the time.  Kind of loosely risk like.

[b]Includes Kemet: Ta-Seti expansion.[/b]

Kemet is a "dudes on a map" game that, in my mind, gets a lot of things right. The playing time is reasonable, the ability to tech up is very slick, and the technologies seem relatively balanced. Combat is pretty straightforward, and you can invest in beefing up a troop meaningfully... and yet no troop is ever totally safe.

The one reaction our group had is that the game end at 8 or 10 VPs creates some "gaminess" and potential kingmaking. I want to try this more to see if that criticism holds up. But the game is good enough so far that I'm excited to try and play this some more to see if my opinion rises or falls.

Once you become one with the relatively short but inconcise rulebook, this is a very solid, fairly simple area control game.  Plays in just the right amount of time, although you can adjust victory point winning conditions up or down if you like.  One thing to look for, many say Kemet has excellent components.  For the most part, this is true.  The creature minis are top notch and finished with a sort of desert sand airbrush paint job.  However, the troop figures are somewhat weak.  Flimsy, shoddy and likely to break if not packed well during breakdown.

RATING: 6
Very tightly designed mechanics and beautiful components. Draws inevitable comparisons to Cyclades - but overall feels to me like a dumbed-down version. What's here is good, very good, but there just isn't that much once you get past the excellent and extensive tech tree/power tiles. Options for victory essentially revolve around constant combat. But unlike many other games which use combat to drive the action, here victory points are earned simply for winning. This is regardless of whether you take over or hold a glorious temple of the gods or a stretch of empty desert. Combat therefor is not a means to victory but an end in itself and with few other victory point options the chant of "fight! fight! fight!" sums up the strategic subtlety of this game. 
Nevertheless I still enjoyed the game for what it was and clearly my expectations were influenced by my experience with Cyclades. Many other reviewers have found more than enough to this game, and I look forward to playing again.

RATING: 7
Expected to love this one. My group has a bit of an AP issue at times, so our game of 4 literally took 3.5 hours (most of which is staring at the aid sheet which I copied for everyone) I love the upgrade system overall but it is also like learning another language of symbols, and the movement system is weird how you basically just teleport everywhere. I think they went too far to prevent defense. Battles are often one sided and overall I do like the card play. Too many rules are straight mechanical instead of supporting a theme, and interactions such as "I win the battle because I was stronger, so you have to retreat, but you played more blood and killed all my troops, so I don't get the territory, nor do I get victory points, even though I won... Weird. Will play again in the future but more likely to suggest Blood Rage for depth or Cyclades for ease of play. Definitely has promise after the downtime is cut down and players become experienced.

Update: Played with a different group that was more receptive, 5 player, tons of fun. The small issues fade into the background and focus stays on the excellent decision making and upgrade system. Tight and tense till the end. After many plays we have seen multiple strategies do well, and the winner has always been decided by either 1 VP or a tie breaker.

A solid, very fun battle game.  I hesitate to call it a wargame as it lacks depth, but it offers excitement and intrigue instead.  I love the multiple strategies that can be employed to keep the game fresh.  Almost entirely void of luck, except for the random divine intervention cards.  A fine example of when a Eurogame adopts an American gaming style and succeeds in blending both.

I enjoy it while I'm playing, but I find it hard to get back on the table for some reason. I think it's something about ALL of the tiles need to be thoroughly explained, or else people aren't really playing. And it feels like a bit of grind to go through them all. In our first few games, the last round always seemed to have a heavy dose of kingmaking. Definitely better than Cyclades though.

While reading through the rules, I was struck by Kemet's similarity to another game which came out that Spiel: Al Rashid. The games do completely different things of course, but still the fact that one takes a simple game core and augments it with a lot of rule modifying and/or enhancing cards [i]is[/i] rather similar. Of course Kemet shares something with Matagot's earlier offspring Cyclades too: quick and tactical combat all over the place. I'm sure that these similarities are coincidental (and perhaps they aren't), but it's still fun to point them out.

Kemet is a VP race where VP are awarded for achieving certain fixed objectives in the game. Winning combat is an important one, but another is for example sacrificing troops on a special shrine. The game is played until a fixed amount of VP has been obtained by one player, and that player will win immediately. Expect therefore a major brawl from about 5 minutes into the game until the end with all the usual bells and whistles: leader bashing, ganging up, killing the weakest player, and so forth. Add to this mayhem the ability of development in three different areas which give benefits in certain ways (offense, defense, income, movement, ...) by collecting these benefits in the shape of usually unique development cards, semi-open battle cards, and a small WP engine to tie it all together, and you've got a pretty good grasp what Kemet is about. The battle cards are interesting: you get a set of six, and upon entering a battle select two, one of which gets discarded face down onto your personal discard pile. The various numbers on the remaining card indicate how many hitpoints and defensive points and whatnotpoints are doled out and received prior to injury; if necessary augmented (or weakened) by developments obtained prior to the combat. The trick is that these six cards are all you get, and if you exhaust your hand, you take up your discard pile. Attentive players will therefore learn over the course of the game what your hand is capable of; it will also shape your own development path.

Kemet is a game revolving solely around combat for combat's sake. This is no place for turtling and building up a position: this is Unreal Tournament in boardgame form. And set in ancient Egypt rather than the future, of course. The rules indicate as much: winners attack. Not mindlessly, of course, but they don't sit still in a corner either. And that is one of things that puts me off. Combat for the sake of combat is not a design pattern I find interesting. Perhaps when we're done in 20 minutes or so, but not when the game takes significantly longer (which Kemet does). The numerous development cards and WP engine are there to increase longevity and diversity, which is obviously a Good Thing. But I can't shake the feeling that it is all about adding up numbers on one of six cards with a few modifiers and comparing these, and then there's a lot of extra stuff in the game for this simple action! This is not meant to be a thinky game, yet it feels at times like it is. This can be good or bad depending on how you usually approach this sort of game. And finally, Kemet's execution is, to my eyes, yucky. The board is too stark and 'hard' in colours and contrasts; and the developments are examples of total form over function. It's what Matagot are famous for, of course, but they went overboard in this design. Cyclades is stylish [i]and[/i] reserved; Kemet is just an eyesore.

In short: while the game offers some great functionality for those who like this combat for the sake of combat-approach, including a semi-deterministic combat resolution and lots of ways in which to specialise, it is not a title made for me. Even though the garish design results in one point deduction, I'm inclined to cancel this in view of the obvious effort to make a not totally looney tactical combat game with a lot of options and possibilities to avoid staleness. But the end note, a 4, does not indicate the same willingess to play as do my other 4's.

Quite a fun and varied light war-game. The power tiles ensure some variety between games, though it isn't enough to make the players feel they have a uniquely customised army every game (it mostly come down to small status boosts, a little extra money, or a seldom-used alternative victory point condition). 

The game is a comfortable length for the depth it offers. The battle card system works well: the limited options and the lack of randomness present the players with both the chance and the need to plan multiple battles ahead, so they have the right cards when they need them.

The fellow explaining the rules said, "this game will be over in fewer turns than you think." And indeed, it was so.

I'm generally somewhat fond of "let's fight!" games which have something to fight over, and which don't penalize attacking. Kemet was no exception, and I enjoyed most of the mechanics and dynamics. The one exception: it seemed (on one play) like the upside to winning attacks was so high that (a) you nearly always wanted to optimize for "what battle am I most likely to win?" rather than "what battle will best funnel into a larger strategy?", and (b) having the weakest army on the board was asking to be attacked by anyone who could manage it. The latter in particular led to nearly every troop sent out being 5 units strong, ideally with monster backup, and I found the homogeneity of troop size made the game less interesting.

(I'm wondering if our table was overvaluing disbanding troops, overlooking that the action required to get them back on the table could instead be used for 2 prayer.)

Would happily play again.

Kemet is a gamer's game. There are a lot of moving parts here, so teaching this to new players can be difficult. Once you have a group of experienced Kemet players the game takes off and provides one of the best gaming experiences you will find. It looks phenomenal, moves at a nice pace and is full of "take that" opportunities that aren't too punishing to the other players. It also rewards those who can think laterally and rebound from adversity. It even managed to sneak in a bit of worker placement as the way to decide your actions each phase and I love the fact that turn order can change between each round. More games should implement that idea. Highest possible recommendations, except to new gamers.

Feels a bit light, random, and over maybe a bit too quickly. Overall, movement is so dynamic that it's not about area control and if you're wanting it to be, you'll be surprised or frustrated. It's about scrapping for fights. But then even the fights themselves are just "play a card and add your unit count" -- and your pool of cards is only six cards. Just not a lot of depth. The tech tree with the power tiles is interesting and does add depth -- I can see how some players could get really into that and path strategies based on it, optimize, etc., but I don't find myself sufficiently captivated by this design to want to spend much time on that. Should give this another shot before I consider trading this otherwise pretty highly rated and high-production-value game. But life is short, and I don't see much more Kemet in my life.

The premier Euro-hybrid dudes-on-a-map game. Deterministic combat is mitigated by a small deck of cards each player receives that modifies the combat result, along with a few Divine Intervention cards that can be used during combat. Very tense, adding the black tiles from Ta-Seti is mandatory for greater variability.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
After one game: another very good dudes on a map game. This one encourages attacking very much and therefore there's constant action from the beginning. Combat is based on calculating possible enemy moves and watching opponents' previously played cards so you can predict what they MAY play this time, but it's not 100% sure. And thanks to the divine intervention cards you can never be certain if you win or lose. 

Concerning the basic gameplay Kemet does not outstand that much. You recruit new army(and I like the fact that you can recover nearly your entire army in just one turn - thanks to this the game is very dynamic, units appear on a map quickly... and die even more quickly!), move, attack, pray to gods to get power you can spend... and here comes the thing. Because you can afford not only new units but also improve your empire technologically. Power tiles is where Kemet really shines. There are plenty of them, divided into three colours: red(attack), blue(defense) and white(utility). At the start of a game there's no assymetry, but as it all goes on each player will have different possibilities and specialise in other fields. Some tiles allow you to recruit a creature that has some unique abilities and most of the time help your units to fight more efficiently.

The victory point system is interesting and handled well. There are permanent VPs, gained mainly from winning a battle(but not only), and temporary VPs - for maintaining control of temples on a board, for example. Thanks to that variety Kemet is a deep, complex game as there are always many things to consider. You can even gain a point by buying a proper power tile!

I can't reach verdicts after playing a single game, but I really liked it(despite the fact that we confused many rules and played a bit incorrectly). Looking forward to play it again, unfortunately I don't own the game - but maybe that will change?

Preliminary rating after a single play. Excellent components. This fast paced battle game falls short of excellent because of three things: too many special powers to learn right away, too easy to bash the leader having the final turns degenerate into "how can we stop her from winning" and finally while the teleportation makes the game play fast paced it also creates a ton of chaos that I'm not sure I appreciate in this game.

RATING: 8
Great, great game, with lots of theme, cool mechanics and even including a taste of wargame with "dudes on a map".
The aim of the game is to develop and gain strenght with our tribe, so that it can be possible to outrun the opponents, either by scoring points with offers to the gods or by winning battles.
There can be few or there can be lots of interactivity, depending if the players engage with each other in battles or not. The battle resolutions depend a bit out of luck (number of troops + power of creatures + power of hidden cards) but the original twist here is that the loosing side may sometimes be the one who profits more from that battle.
Things can be a little chaotic in middle game since that, with the "teletransport" power, attacks can come from everywhere, however, that´s also an element of surprise in the game.
The first few games can be a little hard because there are dozens of tiles with different powers to chose from, however, (and although a bit unbalanced) the powers of the 3D creatures are quite thematic in Egypt mythology and visually apealling.

We're all followers of different gods in the Egyptian pantheon and we're trying to gain the most favor from our gods, represented by victory points in game. If a person has at least 8 victory points at the end of a round, they win. How do you get points? There are a number of ways. You can win battles as an attacker, you can occupy temples, you can research abilities that just give you points, and so on. All while acquiring unique abilities for your army.

Unique game play with the hidden but same hand of battle cards to choose from spiced with some additional card play. The strength, blood, and shield battle mechanism is really interesting.

Simple but deep resource management, cool player powers and miniatures that make every game unique and provide a lot of space for strategic and tactical play.

Great quality miniatures and art.

Occasional problem with kingmaking but I can't help but forgive it in this case.

Successful strategies seem to favor teching and making few attacks in the beginning which is less what I was hoping for in this game.

This one goes over well in our gaming group each time. A good dudes on a map game with a bit of a tech tree and no roll for success makes this a solid game. While this technically works with two, my wife and I found it lackluster at that player count.

Fast-paced dudes-on-a-map game. It reminds me of mixture of the following games:
- Nexus Ops: achieve certain #VP to win, attacking is rewarded, boost cards and the fast-pace.
- Chaos in the Old World: area control, improve your race according to your strategy, cool minis.
- Game of Thrones: battle resolution playing cards.
- Cyclades: aesthetically, mythological creatures to buy.
Symmetrical game that turns asymmetrical with the development of technologies.
The game is quick, but on first games AP may drag a bit when scanning all technologies available to try to set up a combo/strategy.
Drawbacks (?):
- You can win a battle (and score 1 VP) loosing all your troops whilst enemy troops survive...

Kemet is an amazing game. The C3K expansion elevated it in my eyes, but even without it it is one of my favorite games. A light war game with a technology element. Certainly an improvement in comparison to its older brother, Cyclades, just because you can control the monsters and they stay on the board unlike Cyclades. Amazing!

I'm not sure I get it.  Such a huge board but everyone's teleporting through obelisks.  Also, most comments and reviews say it's fast paced but the first half of every game dragged way too much because everyone's checking what each tile does.

MAYBE it gets better with more plays, but for now it's a solid "meh".  I'll take my wargame needs to Nexus Ops.

First play (3 players) was a blast and pretty quick for this sort of game. I definitely need to print out an extra copy (or three) of the gazeteer, though. The symbols aren't too hairy, but it's important to know what tiles/ cards are out there.

After a couple plays, I have to say it was quite a positive experience. The different colored temples, and the different colored techs that correspond to those temples, provides some tough decisions about how to invest your prayer points.

The maneuvering is limited but just interesting enough to provide some good tactical choices as well since there are multiple ways to maneuver, with differing costs, depending on where you start and where you're going.

That said, I would say that you should always play with at least 4 players. It just wasn't as interesting with 3.

Kemet wins for its quickness in getting people out on the board and battling. The race for the power tiles changes up the game and quickly gets the players asymmetrical. It's sort of a war/area-control game without the fuss. It encourages attacks and you don't have time to turtle.

[2016-01-18 Rating: n.a. First Impression]
Since I don't own this game and I don't know if and when I'll play it again, I wanted to record a short first impression (after a single game). 

While Kemet is at it's heart a dudes on an map (DOAM) game, a genre I despise, my one play of it didn't turn out as bad as I thought it would. The name of the game is attacking since that's one of the ways to generate (permanent) victory points. Going into the game with this in mind, I didn't mind the attacks of the other players too much since it's not like you lose something you've built up for a few rounds. It felt more like your overall strategy is defined by the technologies you acquire and they can't be taken from you. The game play on the map is more tactical than strategic. This became quite clear once we realized that we were playing a key rule wrong: The attacker has the option to take back their units after a victorious battle. Without this rule, no one really wanted to attack because with a weakened army on the map you're just easy prey. With this rule in place, Kemet became more interesting instantly since now you didn't have to fear giving an easy victory point to another player after an attack. With no more easy points to grab on the battlefield anymore, you really had to look hard for good scoring opportunities. Kemet felt a lot more euro like after we implemented this rule.

Nevertheless, I don't think that Kemet will ever become a favorite of mine. There's still the opportunity for king making which I could observe first hand in my game and I still don't like the genre. But if someone in my group would want to play a DOAM game, I would propose Kemet.

Kemet is invariably compared to Cyclades although they are actually very different games. Kemet uses a huge tech tree to generate combos and big moves, Cyclades uses auctions and one off cards that rotate ala Stone Age. 

They're both area control but Kemet is more fluid. The game encourages attacking by awarding VP's for it and by the use of a brilliant map that puts everyone at the same distance from everyone else.

Despite the differences, if you like one, you'll almost certainly like the other. Personally I prefer Cyclades but I'm always happy to play either.

Gain points while also doing your best to prevent others from gaining points.  Beautiful components, and plays really fast for a 'dudes on a map' style game.   I really like the different paths you can take for upgrades.  Played a 4 player game with a lot of diverse players and everyone had fun.  If you are playing to 8 VP, 5 gets you within striking distance, watch out for people with 4+ permanent victory points.

Pros: the market is always exciting and agonizing when your friend buys the tile you wanted. Gameplay is generally fast and simple. 
Cons: larger games can stretch on a bit long. Players can lose interest especially in the late game when most the cool tiles have been bought up and everyone is just playing kill the leader.

Really good and fun game. Lots of decisions to make both strategic, in terms of how you will develop your tile powers and to what purpose, and then lots of tactical opportunistic decisions as to how to grab (and maybe hold) those VP's.

Combat is dice-less but is not deterministic and is a tense affair with nice twists like winning the battle but taking too many hits. The game is dynamic and encourages the attack over defence but without ever making defence a complete waste of time. The monsters are just plain fun and the board which makes everyone's position equal in distance and strategically is a work of genius.

All of this with 8 pages of rules - and great artwork and components. Very good.

Risk with a twist, but I really like the map where everything is the same distance away for everyone.

Same old king making problems you'll find in all games of this type, but since attacking is good for everyone (to get those permanent VPs) it's not as bad as it could be. No major stack of troops and turtling in this game which I like.

In this game you have to fight. You will not win if you do not fight. You are forced to develop red powers, otherwise you are wiped out at the end of the game... In the end rounds. Fights (won) are giving very important points. This game has only one disadvantage. For 3/4 of the games, you read the description of the tiles :) maybe after more games it is easier, but now... Most of the time you do bibliography rather than fighting and a planning.

An excellent wargame with a Euro game feel. The goal is to get eight or 10 V points by battling other players and area control. There is a big focus on special powers collecting. It is also a fairly fast game for how much is in it. Also the game is easy to teach and the rules make sense. Two thumbs up.

A war game/Euro mashup like Cyclades with similar high grade artwork and miniatures. However, there is almost no randomness and the game does a fantastic job of giving the players a lot of fun choices. The mechanics encourage players to move into each others' territories quickly, and that keeps it from the "build your troops for three hours and then fight at the end" tendencies of many other war games. 

The only criticism I might offer is the deep upgrade tile tree is apt to cause AP in many players. But the tile abilities are so simple that I don't feel this is enough to subtract any points.

Kemet is exactly everything I like in a army combat game. The map is perfectly designed that it can traversed in few steps - you're never 'safe' from the threat of combat. There's a myriad of unique abilities, including cool beasts with larger effects. The use of 4-sided dice as pyramids and representations of said pyramids power is absolute genius.

I need to pick up Ta-Seti so bad - adding a fourth color of pyramid, so you need to pick three out of the four each game. Oh man, much requirement. Also need to get the cross-over pack for Cyclades. So much potential in this box, may bump up to a 10 when I get these expansions.

RATING: 6.5
Wanted to like this one a little more than I did.  It's a fine fantasy battle type thing.  I guess a lot of the stuff just felt kind of limiting: the money; the stacking & piece limits on your forces; the bank of possible upgrades, most of which are unique, and all first-come-first-serve; but most of all, the deterministic combat.  I've written about this before, but Kemet at least does it a little better than most.  You have several options on your cards, whether you're going to try and win the battle, damage your opponent's troops, or protect yours from harm, and the usual tradeoffs between them.  Trouble is, it's not usually that interesting.  If you have roughly even forces, you'll each want to play your highest card.  If your opponent outnumbers you enough, you can't win, even with your highest card.  So, you'd want to play a damage card to at least hurt him, but then he'll play a block card, and so forth.  And that's before you factor in the upgrades, many of which give you permanent advantages in battle.  If you fall behind in those, you may discover that you can't win no matter what you do, as your foe has +3 to every combat.  There are a few of the special cards that add to battle totals, so at least that capability exists.
I appreciate a lot of the design.  It's very tight, it doesn't run too long, all the locations are accessible, and so on.  That last, in particular, contributes a lot to the flow of the game and prevents turtling.  Teleport spots litter the field, so as long as you've got a little magic to spend, you can go practically wherever you want.  As cutthroat as it is, you still can't just waltz into someone's base, since the walls stop you for a turn (which the other player can use to prepare).  You can, of course, invest in siege tech to get around this.
There are other oddities.  The fluidity of movement, plus the piece limits and combat from earlier mean that if you lose a battle, you usually want to sacrifice your last couple guys rather than retreating them.  If you leave them out on the board, another player's liable to swoop in and pick them off, and the teleports are one-way, so you can't recall them home.  Reinforcing might be an option, but it's usually just as easy to disperse them and re-summon back at base.
I don't dislike it, but at the same time feel like there might not be enough there to hold my interest once I've explored a couple of the upgrade paths.

Not completely sure how I feel about this one. I feel like the combat may be a little repetitive and easy to see who is going to win from the start of the fight and the divinity cards might not be enough to spice it up. It just seems like the game is just get a full troop and teleport and fight and do it over and over.

After 1 play:

I wanted so bad to love this game, but I felt let down after my first play. 
This game had everything I could ask for in a game: combat, card play, tech, and a wide variety of strategies to play with. But instead it came across as a game that had its does in every pool, but not enough to satisfy.

ITS A WARGAME!
Yeah, kind of. Because everyone has the same cards the battles seem to lack the unknown that games like Cosmic Encounter or Dune have (my two favorite games). I found that battling with less than 5 troops was pointless, there was just no chance of an underdog win.

You also miss out on feinting (sp?) attacks because of positioning since everyone can always attack everyone.

ITS A WORKER PLACEMENT GAME!
No, it's not. A good worker placement game has blocking of opponents. Here you only have to make about one choice in actions in the top row. It works, but it doesn't seem to be a great fit. I think I like how Chaos in the Old World handles a similar system better. Where you just do things until you run out of magic...or whatever.

SO WHATS GOOD?
I like the techs that give you plenty of routes to upgrade. The minis and art are good (not mind blowing). It's relatively quick. But the best thing this game has going for it is timing. If you're not trying to figure out your opponents next few moves or techs they're going after, your going to struggle. Getting the timing of events down is key to this games success and enjoyment.

In the end it was average for me. I'll play it again, but I won't push for it. I rarely felt clever during the game and the battles never felt as exciting as I thought they would. I think this game is a little over hyped.

Quick war game with perfect balance of luck and strategy where attacking is reworded and turtling is discouraged.
It has wonderful ancient Egypt theme, and small pretty detailed miniatures, different for every factions, including neutral monsters. Advantage shifts from turn to turn and the winner is not known until the very last turn.

The main thing Kemet has going for it is speed and ease of play. Some players can dither over all the upgrade tiles but generally there's no reason why it should take you more than a couple of minutes per player turn. The game feels very neatly balanced and forces aggression and risk taking on all the players. The result is lots of plastic getting push around the games glorious board and stuff getting killed. Its good fun but I wonder if it will dissolve down to table politics once the upgrade tiles become familiar.

Awesome game.

Think of this as a tactical light wargame set in Heavy Metal Ancient Egypt, with the best mechanisms from Euro games and the ability to make your faction completely unique and asymmetrical.

There is the mother of all upgrade shops on the side of the map. Most upgrades are unique. A lot of these upgrades give you mythical monsters (complete with minis). 

The map is incredible - because it somehow manages to make every space no further than 2 moves away from every other space - and yet it looks like a map of Egypt.

Oh, and YOU MUST ATTACK.

Fail to attack and you've lost a precious opportunity to earn points. First to 8 points wins.

Awesome game.

Most of my mates would rather play Kemet than Chaos in the Old World. 

Only criticism - 2 of the upgrades seem overpowered, so we've just removed them from the game.
-White Tier 1 Upgrade (All purchased upgrades are $1 cheaper)
-Red Tier 4 upgrade (Kill 2 dudes before combat starts)

A euro game that favors confrontation? I'm in! In Kemet you cannot win by turtling, so you have to go all-in if you want a shot at victory. The game system reminds of Blood Rage or Chaos in the Old World in which you have 'currency' to spend on actions that allow you to attack, control areas, get new powers or basically get stronger. Love the temporary VP that can make the game switch sides quick. Love this one and I also own the expansion.

Kemet is a euro-ameritrash hybrid. It has a lot of plastic components, direct confrontation, and creates incentives to initiate conflict. On the other hand, it has a tech-tree, action points, the winner is determined by VP, and the card combat is fairly deterministic. I can see why this game appeals to many people. It doesn't really appeal to me on a component level since I actively dislike unpainted plastic minis. Beyond that, the tech-tree can be make players be prone to some analysis paralysis, especially due to the iconography and lack of player aids. I recognize this is a solid design and I certainly like it better than Cyclades, but I think the perfect euro-amertrash hybrid is out there somewhere and I'm going to hold out for it rather than keep Kemet.

Juego divertido de lucha directa. Reglas bastante faciles, lo único son las muchas fichas de poder que hay que aprender. Pero la 2^ partida estoy seguro que será ya mucho mas fácil. Quiero darle otra vez y a ver que tal. Probado a 5. Molaría probar a menos jugadores.

La 2' partida me gustó menos que la primera... si la 3' será así... se vende.

Glen & Richard own this. This is one of the best area control, combat-oriented games that I have played. It incentivises attacking and has a catch up mechanic for the player with lowest VPs (they choose turn order and going last is a big advantage), Building up the tech trees and all paths are possible. I've had two four-player games and it seems that dominating at least one of the tech trees (white - economy, blue - defence, red - attack) and utilising its strengths while not making yourself the target for the other players are the keys to victory.

It takes some getting used to because [i]everything[/i] is done differently than in other games and you need the manual for all the symbols. But after a few plays it should move quicker. I really like the little rules tweaks to make it an offensive game. Superb production!

The main reason I don't rate this higher is because of the rather steep hurdle to get into the game. You have access to all the power tiles right from the beginning and since there are many you can only get once and all their functions are explained through icons, you basically have to explain every one to newcomers or they might feel cheated.

Very pretty, low complexity area control wargame. an excellent effort that has a broad appeal. The winner is the person who sticks to a consistent strategy and can husband their score well enough not to wear a neon sign declaring they are too far ahead.

Turn order and resource management are key. Tracking of victory point sources is very well done in a manner that initially seemed superfluous, but proved to be crucial information when vying for the win.

Attacking is not only encouraged but rewarded as a primary source of VP. Area control is also rewarded at key locations with synergistic bonus VP.

Very cool, best of all it is not related to Cyclades as I feared.

Fast and furious! Love the high fantasy Egyptian art style. Game play is easy to grasp and offers everything that the epic area control games do, but in a fraction of the time while also removing all the dumb luck involved with card draw and dice. However, I'm not a big fan of the limited movement options and feel that player order wins many games in the end.

Winning is impossible without conflict.  And I like the way it is handled.  No dice rolling, uncomplicated & quick.  Creating a strategy is important.

 The tiles in game to game stay the same (much to my pleasure) so that with a few plays we know what is available and which combinations might be good to try.  It is easily learned although I kept forgetting all the minor ways victory points were won, so I had to be told I won when I didn't even realize how, and had to ask.  Temporary points do not have to be converted to permanent ones in order to win!  Permanent/temporary VP's is another interesting aspect, unique in games, for me.  

Art work & components are great, the board is easy to read as are the cards, tiles, & player's boards.

This is a decent dudes on a map game.

Theme is kind of there with the minis and the powers and the art, although it is not as ingrained in the types of actions you can do.

Overall, I liked the tech trees, the 'smallness' of the board, teleporting around, the attacking with the cards, etc.  There is a lot to like.  Although at the end, there can be some kingmaking.

I don't think this is one that I'll play all that often as I normally like more thematic games, but for a decent DoaM game it's worth a play every now and again.

Pros
-Moderate game length
-Supports different number of players via different boards
-All players equal distance to each other player
-Card based combat rather than dice, can have impact even with small army/losing
-Game rewards offense (which also nearly sets a definite end game)
-Unique and interesting tech tracks
-Can acquire monsters, miniatures for them are pretty good
-Lots of viable strategies
-Turn order done a bit awkwardly

Cons
-Possible king making
-Small army sizes, winner of combat is typically whoever has 5 units + monster
-Players do not have inherent unique powers (minor)
-Could use a larger pool of combat cards? 6 feels repetitive but makes it more predictable

Le meilleur jeu de poutrage. Un système de combat génial. Une progression intéressante. 
Quelques combo toxiques mais qui ne font pas gagner par rapport à un gameplay plus équilibré. 
L'extension Ta Seti renforce l'interet du jeu malgrès l'interet très limité des nouvelels cartes intervention divines très Win to Win et des Tuiles Noires complement déséquilibrés / ininteressantes. La nouvelle fin de partie / Phase d'aube / Ta Seti sont un super apport.
Une FAQ complete ne serait pas de trop car pas mal de questions au cours de la partie.

Améliorations potentielles :
- Retirer les cartes Intervention divines néfastes.
- Imposer une taxe de 1 pour le Recall d'unité pour l'attaquant ?
- Reworder les tuiles noires ou colorier différement certaines tuiles (inverser du B et du R par exemple).

Holy wow this is awesome. The bits are awesome and the gameplay surprisingly lived up to it.

It is entirely thematic fun, brutal, fighting, somewhat remeniscent of Game of Thrones.

RATING: 7
Combative game where permanent victory points are only awarded to a winning attacker or the current holder of designated areas.  This prevents turtling and rewards aggression which is great as everyone is incited to join the fray.  You also can buy power tiles which are unique powers that will only apply to you.  The leveraging of the power combinations is clearly a big part of the game, but I haven't played it enough to understand the combinations.

RATING: 7
The three technology trees provide an entertaining method of alternate victory strategies, even if the game centers around fighting. It strikes me that a particular power which makes each power cost one prayer point less is ridiculously good and difficult to pass upon as player 1 and player 2, but that may be inexperience talking.
The battles really work out because they center around two different goals: Winning the actual fight and keeping units alive to hold their location. The divine intervention cards provide a satisfying, but not unmanageable, amount of randomness to the game, since if a player really stockpiles them the player becomes weak once all those cards have been used.

A fantastic Ameritrash wargame! There are just so many components to this game that I love: the upgrade system, the battle system, the VP system, etc. Play felt very well balanced. Decisions were many and it was always a struggle to figure out which move was the best at any given time given how many things could be done that would help one's goal overall. BEAUTIFUL looking game! Simple to understand and yet it feels like a very in-depth game. The game is set up so that there is constant fighting going on - it is not a game where anyone can turtle away and build up VPs in any way that they will win. This game promotes action. Iconography works. I can't say enough good things about this game. It is one of those games where you will say, "if only I had one more action!" Amazingly, none of the mechanics are new, but Kemet still comes off as innovative and distinct.  I am after several plays feeling a bit raw over its "eat and be eaten" style of gameplay.  It definitely is a game that allows at points for some bash-the-leader and king-making situations, and I'm not a fan of that style of game personally. It's the one kink in my overall enjoyment of Kemet. But it's not a fault of the game; simply a part of the gameplay that doesn't totally gel with me personally. But all in all, it's one of my favourite dudes-on-a-map games.

The production of the game for me was an immediate warning.  This game was a little to garish than I normally like - it blinded like an airbrushed van with wizards and scarabs and scorpions in a sand storm, Oh my!!  

The game play didn't impress either as it felt a mess of  mechanics that ultimately funnels toward an uninteresting combat system (which is the core of the game).  I add my points you add yours - resolve.  Sounds simple enough, but with so many bonus tiles, cards etc. after finally tallying and comparing you often find yourself either stalemated or picked apart and neither beaten or victorious (leaving you ripe for easy conquest from the next player in turn order).  

The latter issue just leads to people hesitating to fight - creating the oft-maligned action of combat avoidance and slowly grabbing VPs from safer outlets.  

A boring and mechanically infantile game I wish to never play again.

Very aggressive. There was a time when I would have loved this game, probably the same time I played a lot of Risk, or not long after. These days, the idea of a game where players must constantly attack each other for attacking's sake just doesn't sound like such a fun time to me anymore. Feels a bit like a battle royale, people bashing at anyone they can. A well-designed game for what it is--I'm just not the right target audience for it anymore.

The map is pretty garish, though I suppose the miniatures are of good quality, and it's neat to see a giant beetle coming down the map, coming at you. I may not mind playing it again, but it's not something I need to keep in my collection.

A fast-paced game of controlling areas, murdering people controlling the areas you want to control, and then using the power of the Gods themselves to murder/control even more people/areas. It's going to take a few plays to grok all of the power tiles (there are 48 of them, and only a few are duplicates) and ability combinations available, but it's fair to say no two games will be the same. The rapid movement available, and strategic element of controlling temples at the end of the turn make for a satisfying game that doesn't outstay its welcome.

I liked everything "surrounding" the core of the game: the tech tree is diversified and interesting, the creatures are fun to use and amazingly sculpted, the temples-control mechanic assures conflict and the points on attack prevent you from turtling.

Unfortunately, all of this cannot help the bland and quite dull "move and play a card" mechanic which is the central concept of the game.

I'd like to try it again, but so far I find it BY FAR inferior to cyclades.

Like [thing=120677][/thing] I found the rules to be over-complex for my tastes; I prefer when complexity arises organically from a simpler rule set. But this game gets extra credit for being highly interactive and dynamic, wonderfully (over)produced, and just plain fun - almost all the tiles you can buy give you the heady feeling of being hugely powerful, and who can fail to enjoy recruiting a massive scorpion or a rage elephant into their army?

This is a pretty solid war/area control game. The gameplay mainly is determined by what tecs you purchase with everyone starting on the same footing. Very simple to learn with slight paralysis by analysis, but only in regards to purchasing tech tiles. Simple and easy game to learn. 

The power tiles are not as fun as I like, which is what this game focuses around. This is why I lowered the score. I'd rather play cthulu, war of the rings, or twilight struggle.

The first game I ever got tunnel vision for. This thing is awesome - it's what you wanted Risk to be when you were growing up. Awesome combats, strategies, and feints with a cool customizable way to do upgrades. Feels like a tech tree in a video game. 

Fast to teach and play for how much interesting stuff is going on. The only hard part for new players is absorbing all the power tiles, but with a little guidance they will be fine.

Comparable to Blood Rage - I would be the same amount of happy owning or playing either, just happen to own Kemet. Kemet is easier to teach and probably better in general for situations where new players are playing exp players.

I love how tight the board is, how the game rewards aggression, how temporary VPs change hands often. Yep, looks like I'm gushing over this game! That being said, I'm guessing it rewards repeated plays (knowledge of the tiles etc).

Great game. One of my new favorites. I love the power tiles, the special monsters and the abilities. I love the teleportation and the need to constantly attack, which is not typically my style of game. This one gets me out of my comfort zone and forces me to think tactically. I really enjoyed my play of this and hope it hits the table again soon. I might have to pick up my own copy. I haven’t rated this yet because we played the “short” version to 8 points instead of the longer version to 10. I think a full game will solidify this one in the mid-8 range for certain.

Kemet is a game in which player battle each other until one player have 8 (or 10) victory point.  Some VP are permanent and some are temporary.  The permanent VP cannot be lost whereas the temporary can (most of the time its because your opponent take it from you).
Each player have an individual player board on which they select their action.  Actions includes :
- Recruit unit
- Move unit (attack if an opponent is on the same spot)
- Pray (to gain prayer point which are needed for some of the actions)
- Raise a pyramid (each player have a pyramid of each color that allow them to buy powers of that color)
- Buy a blue, red or white power (or creature)

You can gain Permanent VP by :
- Winning battle while being the attacker (if the defender wins, he don't get VP)
- Gaining a VP power tile
- Controlling the Sphinx
- Controlling 2 temples at the end of a turn
- Sacrificing 2 units in the Sanctuary of all Gods

You can gain temporary VP by :
- Raising a pyramid to level 4 (or controlling an opponent's one)
- Controlling temples

I like all the different powers.  They all seem great but you can't have them all.  The creatures also have special power that strengthens your troops!

Looooved this game!
The rules are not overly complex, but not trivial either - there are a couple of nuances; but once you have a go for a few rounds, you'll be flying.  However, mastering the strategical and tactical depth of this game is not a matter of one play-through.
Solid area-control.  Again, feels very different from Blood Rage and El Grande - also the heaviest in terms of the rules from the three (although not by a lot).
Solid solid keeper!

Usually, when I play a game no more than a certain number of times, I feel obliged to give a higher rating than the one I actually feel when I play. That is because I think I don't know the game well enough to judge it fairly. 

With Kemet, I feel I really know in which ballpark we're playing, and that is area control games with asymmetrical powers thrown in. Also Kemet seems to end always in a (soft) fart. 

Now, I believe that some games do a better job than this one in doing what it's set to do. Those games are Chaos in the Old World, and Cyclades. Why would I ever want to play this one? Why? Well the brutal answer is that I wouldn't.

End game had been triggered.  James's hand was shaking as he directed his bestial horde towards my temple. His great Phoenix led the charge and smashed into my beleaguered defenders. James clenched his fist and yelped.  He had taken his score to 10 and reduced mine to 10. He was going to win on turn order.  With only my turn left, James began to savour his victory.  A satisfied (smug?) smile played across his face.  I could do little now... except ... James saw it, his face fell... I raised my last pyramid.  And secured my 11th victory point. James was distraught and exhausted.  His head was in his hands. "You've just ruined my life", he whimpered. 

Kemet is this good.

A remarkably designed game with a number of interesting mechanics that all seem to work well together. A game in which you begin feeling like you can devise a masterful strategy but always feel constrained by the pressures of limited actions and constant threats from opponents and a fairly limited amount of time. It creates a pressure cooker type environment which i like in a game (particularly one focused on intense conflict). sleeved

RATING: 7
Interesting game of warfare with Euro mechanics and fantastic miniatures. Combat is at its core, and almost everything you do outside of attacking your opponents works toward improving your odds in battle, directly or indirectly. That happens by the acquisition of special power tiles, including mythical creatures, and those tiles are the soul of the game. But although the rules are simple, the sheer number of special powers may be intimidating to new players.

The game works, but with the easiness to teleport troops to points of interest and the ability to "recall" them after battles, it is a bit strange, with most areas of the map being always empty. Defending your position is extremely hard and there is barely any tactical allocation of troops. Also, a lot depends on turn order, which is oddly chosen every round by the player in last place. It often feels a little scripted, as players tend to leave their attack actions to the end of the round, in order to take advantage of newly acquired special powers and to reduce the risk of being attacked. Those flaws prevent me from rating it higher, but it is still a solid design.

Kemet is a really nice game, but there are a few things that keep me away from buying it.

1) You need to have a plan when buying the tiles. If you end up with no combat-boosts, you will be crushed. My problem here is that others can sabotage your plans, which may kill your whole lategame.

2) More likely the nature of such a game, but still, teaming up against another player can have a huge impact, even if they do it for a single round only.

3) However, the major issue I have with this game is kingmaking and it looks like it will always be this way. This is what keeps me away from it, sadly.

A light area-control game emphasising battles between players. Rather cheap aswell. Unfortunately the fight system is simply too light. It doesn't seem to matter at all which cards you decide to play since the opponent can choose between beating you in strength this turn or taking out your units to beat you in the next. There is hardly any strategy or tactic here.

Everything else I love about the game. Teleportation ensures that no one is safe and the fact that victory points can be stolen pushes players into open conflict. But the battle card system feels very incomplete. That's a big con for a game that is all about battles. After just 2 plays I felt like I had seen everything the game had to offer, all power tile combos included. The power tiles are very simple too, by the way. I played with two AP-prone casual gamers and both of them got the hang of them in a few turns.

This game is Cyclades' goofy little brother. Even the theme is a lot more wacky. They have a similar feel, with ancient battles and mythical creatures coming to your aid. The giant d4s being used as pyramids is an inspired choice. 

But while I love Cyclades, I only like this game. Though they do have a lot of mechanical similarities, but the main difference is the removal of the auction system and the addition of drafting instead. I do love those tiles that are drafted. Every single one seems extremely overpowered, which makes for wonderfully difficult choices. 

However, kingmaking and runaway leaders seem to be a problem in this game, whereas Cyclades always feels a lot tighter to the end of the game.

This was the first game I owned, based on 'sort of' hard sale from the shop assistant at my local bg cafe. Back then, I knew so little about bg. A lot to take in as a first owned game. We did enjoy it. But we also soon found some 'bugs' of the game. For example, if you got the card 'kill two soldiers before the battle starts', you would basically be guaranteed a win.

Aggressive and in your face! Kemet puts aside all diplomacy; your only two game play options are either to 1) punch your friends in the mouth or to 2) get in a better position to more effectively punch your friends in the mouth. And you'll all be having fun the whole time doing it! I like the game's hyper focus on offense. The ability to be two steps from any player on the map adds a nice uneasiness to the dynamic, only making games more tense! Highly variable and mean! Kemet is a fantastic area control game in my books.

This game is confrontation through & through wich i love.. rules are super easy but the combinations are many. And the coolest, all of the advancements are great.. you wanna have all of them, wich shows that they playtested a lot.

I wish there were more movement & area control, because area control is very fleeting in this game, you're constantly calling your forces back, because holding positions isn't really the key but solely winning battles.

And at the end the usual leader-bashing bothers me quite a bit.

First of all this is one of the most beautiful game of all time. Just look at this outstanding box cover! I watched a gameplay video and decided to buy it. The rules are quite simple but the game offers some depth. It is a huge advantage that finally i have a game where something is actually happening on the board. I mean the interaction is not just that im taking the tile before you. After unboxing the game still surprises me with it's detailed board and the miniatures however unfortunatelly the game quality is far from good. It come by a broken red miniature, one of the black army's unit is from the other faction but colored as black, the board has a small dent. If you are going to buy a product of matagot be aware of such things. The game itself is outstanding and i believe it will make us really good moments when we are playing with it. The game seems to be balanced out quite well. You are constantly thinking which power tile and which action should i buy. Every single turn there is a movement and a ton of fight otherwise you won't get the nececary VP points. There are a lot of options and way to achieve victory but if you loose it is still fun to do. The theme is one of the best they can choose from i appreciate they choosed it.

Pros:
-One of the most stellar graphics of all time.
-Easy rules, fun gameplay, but the options have depth in them.
-Finally a game where something is happening. Fighting all over the place.
-A great theme which manages you will fall into love with it in your first game.

-The quality of the product is under everything i have ever encountered. Be aware of broken miniatures, dented board.
-For that price i believe there are some better price / value games out there.

If ever there was a game made to teach you that “he who hesitates is lost”, it’s Kemet. In a game where heathen Egyptian deities teleport from temple to temple scourging the victory points from them, where the only thing better than having a giant scorpion is also having the fire pigeon, placing one action marker badly is like stepping off a shinkansen to watch a leaf drop: strangely moving if anyone else was in the vicinity.

Because Kemet is all about the snowball effect. Some games are about, and I am forced to appear gauche here, ‘earning a well-balanced number of victory points toward your vaguely liberal arts degree’. Not Kemet. Kemet is about showing up to the party first, with the best hardware, then shooting everyone else as they ring the doorbell. If you aren’t catapulting yourself exponentially higher with each action, you’re losing. A play of Kemet is short and quick, like nothing so much as a hand grenade in a bathroom. I shit you not, this is cage fighting done right.[color=#ffffff]a9Z4MnAx[/color]

To me, this is pretty close to a perfect confrontational board game, and that's coming from someone who does not really love confrontation much. There are some flaws though:

They could have included more reference guides in the box (we played most of a game with all of us passing one reference booklet around until I realized I should make photocopies). It's minor, but it does slow the game down quite a bit since people can't choose their tiles while waiting for their turn. Make photocopies, problem solved. 

Combat is a little odd. You're dealt 6 random cards from the beginning of the game and you're stuck with them (unless we played incorrectly). So there's a whole other pile of battle cards that's never touched. So if your six cards aren't great, tough luck. It seems like it'd be easy to house-rules that (which we might do in the future). It's a pretty minor problem, I just think it's an odd rule choice. 

Otherwise, it's a wonderful game. I thought it'd be on the lighter side, but I actually found it to be somewhat heavy. Your options are WIDE OPEN at the beginning of the game, which can be slightly overwhelming. However, even our non-gamer friends had a great time, so I don't think things are so overwhelming that the game becomes unfun. I think this has a lot to do with the fact that there seemed to be very few bad choices to make, even though there were a lot of them.

The end of the game was tense. All players were within 2 points of winning, and it just came down to winning a battle (1VP) in a temple (1VP). It was exciting. We all had radically different strategies (I was red, one player played blue, and one player played white until his epic 1 turn blow out), and yet they all seemed fairly viable. 

The temporary victory point thing was great, and really captured the "changing tide" of battle. The miniatures are amazing. I've painted my Mice and Mystics minis, but these don't need to be painted. The artwork on the board and player cards is excellent. Overall, great game.

RATING: 7
A game that works unusually well for a multi-player wargame, mainly because the damage that you can do to an opponent is limited to a handful of hit points. It also combines an engine game element, where you build your economy (in this case by building up prayer points) by buying special tiles from a supply. Since VPs are gained by attacking and are mostly permanent, an early lead is probably going to be decisive unless trailing players conspire to gift one another easy victories. I preferred this to the similar Eclipse as you can't be arbitrarily knocked out of the game at the whim of an opponent. Recommended for lightweight finish-in-an-evening wargaming.

Streamlined multiplayer conflict game. What makes this interesting is the cards, which grant special abilities, some of which are manifested in the form of giant monsters which join your forces on the board and look really impressive even if they aren't.

Played once at a friend's house. Small amounts of soldiers and necessary multi-area control forces careful distribution of your armies as you try to secure objectives. Tech tracks are interesting, though their implementation with the blind tile adds to battles can be frustrating if one guesses wrong.

Someone else on boardgamegeek described it as a knife fight in a phone box. That's a great description. 
It's all about immediately throwing aggression at your opponents. But to make that effective, you have to find a combo edge from the chocolate box of special ability tiles.

17 games played, however the theme of Armies constantly teleporting all over the place is LAME. The Armies rarely maneuver by foot. It's as if ancient Armies have Aircraft and parachutes. The theme is ruined by the constantly teleporting around legions of soldiers. Also some tech choices are clearly overpowered.

Wonderful mechanics, fast and furious. Kemet is a great example to what a strategy game could be deep and also have quick play. Game demands attacking and movement rather than controlling or turtling. You have alternative ways to play for a short time, decreasing the need for victory point to win the game. Battle mechanism is simple enough to waste no time, making a tactical choice. Kemet quickly become one of my favourite games and will be played for sessions when we need a elegant and quick strategy game.

This lighter war game has a lot of really cool things going for it, from the use of the action board, how it encourages attacking and getting the action going immediately, to the enormous array of power-ups and fun toys you can purchase. All those components can make it a little intimidating and involved to teach, but there is a lot to sink your teeth into after a game or two.

RATING: 7
A pretty solid dudes-on-a-map game. This reminds me first and foremost of Nexus Ops, in that it seeks to overcome the problem of turtling by rewarding you for winning any battle. This works in the sense that no one turtles, but as with Nexus Ops, IMO it creates a thematic disconnect whereby attacking piddly little forces is rewarded as much as or more than holding important territory. 

I also get the sense the that 30 or whatever special power cards in Kemet are pure window dressing. That is, it seems like players put a lot of thought/effort into (1) managing resources (prayer points) so that they can get certain special powers, (2) deciding which special powers would be most advantageous, and (3) working to remember how all the special powers affect battles and resource management. Whereas I think if you stripped away all the special powers you'd see that the design is mostly about take-that and take down the leader -- neither of which I dislike per se, I just feel like why bother obscuring it with all these powers. But perhaps this is a general issue with dudes-on-a-map games. 

In any case, Kemet plays pretty quick, the rules are pretty intuitive, and the minis are great. Next time I'm getting that giant scarab beetle.

Fun game! A bit chaotic to start with, and a lot of parts to keep track of, but overall it works very well. I really like the mystical science-fantasy Egyptian theme, and feel it works perfectly to give life to the very aggressive and kinetic gameplay. All the various power tiles offer very different and interesting effects, so it can be a lot of fun adapting to the available abilities and tailoring a playstyle that is unique to each game.

Yet another dudes-on-the-map type of game. Although Kemet was supposed to be the earliest of its kind, I actually played it after Blood Rage, Scythe, Cry Havoc and Inis. Personally I felt that Kemet falls right in the middle of the pack. The pyramid tiles are not balanced and the battle system felt very weak and uninspiring. Mechanically nothing in the game impressed me.

Love this game! Lots of choices to make toward victory; plenty of battles; great artwork.

Looking forward to many more plays!

I think I just don't like DoaM. The researches add an interesting twist, but adding an interesting twist to a game whose core I don't like won't change much unfortunately.

Update: got a chance to try this again. I'm still fairly convinced that the genre just isn't for me and therefore I have a hard time saying how good an example this is of a DoaM game. Personally, the thing that bothers me the most is how much the game hinges on players policing the game themselves, both in choosing attacks and in setting turn order and so if certain people aren't always thinking about who's winning then some dumb stuff can happen. But if they are doing their diligence than it can feel like bash the leader. So I'm not sure there is a satisfying answer to that for me.

Also, the game heavily incentivizes attacking and also makes you value your dudes very little, which is thematically appropriate but makes the game really weird. It was very rare for people to leave any of their guys on the board after a battle rather than just take them back and get the resources to re-summon them at a temple where they could then teleport. This also lead to this odd situation where there was a standoff of everyone delaying their move actions to the last actions of the round so as to not give anyone any early openings for attack. This just made turn order adjudication that much more important.

The game has it's charms and I can see myself sort of enjoying this occasionally, but having no interest a lot of the time.

I wanted to play this due to it's ranking as a "strategy" game... it's not ranked as a war game so I underestimated the "Fighting" mechanic... which it turns out is not an incidental mechanic here.  Not bad though but there must be something in files section for helping keep track of everyone's base strength/defense/VP's, etc as that was impossible to see from way diagonal or even from across the table what tiles folks acquired/etc.... also the large mini's may be nice for the folks who prefer theme how the hell am I supposed to know what each one is and what their powers are??  A smaller tile on the board to go w/the army instead of the over sized mini would be more functional imho.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (January 2015)

As many friends speak highly of the game, I was expecting something a bit better, still it is a fun game I would play from time to time. The game components are very good as is usual from Matagot, love the miniatures. The play is usually fast if all the players know the tiles, otherwise the downtime can be high. Easy rules.

I enjoy that the game encourages players to attack early making the game very interesting, however nowadays I (generally) don’t enjoy games in which all other players have to attack the leader or lose the game, but this one is of the best I have played in that category. The obvious strategy is to have a low profile for most of the game, letting other players lead while you prepare for your big move near the end of the game. Having saying that, unlike more games, it isn’t necessary a bad thing when you get attacked multiple times (thus the high rating from me). Lots of opportunities for King Making on Kemet, a negative for me.
 
Bottom line, Kemet is  an ok to good game that has a chance to get an improved rating with more plays, however I don’t have any compulsion to buy it because “attacking the leader” is one of my less liked mechanisms. Much better than Cyclades though. 

Current Rating: 6.5

Fun mix of simple wargame, tech tree/engine building and Euro action point turn structure.

RATING: 9.5
Amazing area control game. Unlike others you're encourage to battle constantly and rewarded for it more than if you try to stay out of trouble in build your economy. You still have to make strategic choices and plan things out in advance. But that plan inevitable involves plenty of war. 

The board is brilliantly designed so no-one has a worse starting position. The tech tree is sprawling and appears well balanced. Every time we think there's a broken strategy someone finds a counter. The different miniatures for each race and the monster figurines are great. It's a beautiful sight on the table.

I only didn't give it a 10 because the turn order does have a big effect on the round. First grants your access to first pick on the tech tree. This is a minor advantage (as every choice has a counter). However, going last allows you to take pretty much whatever area you want uncontested (assuming you planned a head) as your last move. 

This wouldn't matter that much, but the person in last place decides the turn order. They often put the person doing best in last as that's usually the worst position to be in a board game. I've only played it a handful of times and I imagine this problem with disappear with more plays, so I may well increase it to 10 later.

Initial Impression - Attack attack attack.  Fortune favours the bold.  Reminded me a bit of small world but better.  The favour tiles act like a tech tree of open information, but like caverna there seems to be enough that there is no one set path.

Looks to be various ways to gather points and no one set route to victory.

Well, combat is a given.

- Kemet is what passes for expensive in my pile of PnP games, budget games, filler and old stuff.

I'm not sure what to call this game. When I think "war game," I think big sprawling maps and chits and counters and rules. This isn't that. It doesn't seem like an area control game either, because you don't win by controlling territory. This game is a high conflict, area conquering (but not holding) slugfest. It was great with 4 players, not so much with 2. I suspect it would be fine with 3 and good/great with 5, but we'll see. It's tons of fun.

Update: I've dropped my rating to a 7. I really loved my first play of this game, but I keep discovering how group dependent it is. I still think it's amazing, but I want to play it less and less the more I realize that I only rarely have the right group.

Good ideas mashed together in conflicting ways. Battles are boring and often there's no reason to go for anything other than a win, which invalidates the whole rock-paper-scissors card system, teleportation to anywhere from your home-base means there's no need for tactical movement or map control. Falls flat every time. Meh.

I know they're very different games, but since I consider Kemet to be a "cousin" of Cyclades, I always compare the two. Kemet is a great game with so many options to choose from in terms of trying to win, and this, in my opinion, is what keeps it from being perfect. Kemet can lend itself to analysis paralysis in a lot of people, and is lacking some of the simplicity of play that makes Cyclades the better game. However, Kemet is still an awesome game

Played it for the firs time tonight. 5 player game. A little long due to being a first play, but 4 of 5 people loved it and want to play some more.

A nice combination between Euro (worker placement, development), and Ameritrash (direct conflict, combat), Kemet is a light skirmish game, with elements of force development, area control, and resource management. 

It plays fast, and encourages player interaction in a clever system of having both permanent and temporary victory points.

Beautiful components, and lots of them, and a ruleset that is learnable in a single play, tremendous amounts of fun, and, I am sure, a playtime that will drop into the 90 minutes or so the box claims all combine for a game I am sure will become a staple in my rotation.

Played once and loved the variety of powers and different ways to score points. Thanks to the volatility of the temporary victory points, games can come down to the wire and lend themselves to surprise come-from-behind moments. Loved every part of it and can't wait to play it again. 

---

Four plays in and the rating has increased for me. 

Kemet plays at a great speed, and keeping pace is one of the keys to victory. If you don't keep your foot on the gas, you're going to get left behind in the race for points. Given the variety of ways to get victory points (both temporary and permanent), you've also got to keep your options open and have multiple irons in the fire - so that you can capitalize on any opportunity. The leader can change at a moment's notice, and it's important to keep everyone else's status in mind to keep your opponents in check. And to allow the person in last place to determine turn order for the next round... I could go on and on.

Love this game and can't imagine ever turning down a chance to play.

15 June 14 - Rating 8. Played last night. Had a great time. Surprise hit with the group. I was worried it was all about battling, but there is plenty else to do to win VPs as well. Occupying temples, sacrificing, getting VPs through upgraded pyramids and power tiles, all help to win the game. We loved the power tiles. We obsessed over them and were ever greedy for more - it was great. Good knowledge of the tiles slowed down our play as we needed to consult the chart for what they did all the time but this is a minor issue only. Can't wait to play again![edit] Oops, forgot to mention the creatures. Awesome fun! I had the ancestral elephant. Once you have one you can't lose it. They can't die. They get sent back to their power tile and then come back on with the recruit action. They look great too. Aaarh, wanna play more!

Odd combination of wargame, fantasy and VP collecting Euro which combine well in practice. The way you are forced to 'go forth and battle' to get VPs prevents turtling.

Want to adore this worker placement area control combo. However, at this point I only like it.  My serious limitations in warfare/combat games makes me truly unable to ever beat my husband. One can only get smacked down so many times without feeling defeated. Hope to one day be able to give him a good challenge at least.

Love this area control game. Basically everything Risk should have been. Very few actual units. Great non-dice battle mechanic. The game discourages turtling and you can purchase player powers.

While I never feel drawn to combat type games, this one was euro-y enough to be fun. I also appreciate that the game encourages and rewards fighting. My normal tendency is to turtle, and it didn't take long to realize that this would not be effective at all. Though I wouldn't seek it out, I would be happy to play this at any time.

Very confrontational area control.  Veteran players will have distinct advantage.  Trying to figure out best play is difficult given that everyone builds up special abilities over the game and there is no way to track them outside of continously studying everyones tableau.  The white tiles also appear to be vital whereas the blue/black/red are balanced.  There are so many other area control games I would much rather play than this mess.

While clever, unique, looks great, and plays fairly quick for all it's doing, it's hard to get past the importance of playing last in the final round, which somewhat lessens the overall experience.

I can see its appeal to the right crowd but the game is just not for me. To me it feels like most of the game happens and is decided at the beginning. You try to get the best possible combination of tiles and then you duke it out. I'd much rather play Cyclades.

I like Kemet. Not enough to rate it an 8. However, it does something that means I do think it deserves such a high score: it incentivizes aggression. Especially how everything, thanks to a teleporting mechanic, is only (at most) two spaces away.
On that front it's very unique in my collection. Makes games go fast and rewards good plays while also creating opportunities for players to do well. 
Also, do love me some nice mythological themes.

Not as good as Cyclades though. Cyclades ends with a bang. Kemet ends in a whimper ("Well, I can't stop either of you! Bah, humbug...")

With three players, this is easily one of the best board games that I have ever played.  The theme and various methods to achieve victory are both top notch.  Unfortunately, a lot of the appeal is lost when playing two player, and for that reason, it doesn't see as much play time as I'd like.

RATING: 8.3
I like this game but if you are playing a 5 player game and there is a new player it really bogs the game down. When they see all the upgrades they get intimidated and panicked. If everyone knows the game it goes on much better. I like the fact that the upgrades in this game much more and they are accessible if you have a pyramid of that color and level. You can choose to ignore low level upgrades and focus on getting the expensive ones or you might get white tiles that make things cheaper and play the economy game. The thing I don't like about the game is that when you pray it feels like you did nothing and you wait once more for other players to play their turns. It creates a lot of downtime for you while everyone does much cooler things. I also have issues with the card combat system where things become if I am losing I will try to kill all your guys thing. For example in Blood Rage when you lose a battle it doesn't feel like personal while in this they purposely destroyed your units. Overall I prefer Blood Rage over this in terms of accessibility, game length and enjoyability so I give this a 8.3 .

RATING: 4
2015-10-04 - 7 - Initial rating after the first game with three players. I liked it but I think I expected something more after all the hype. I definitely want to try it with more players, as it might play better with four, I expect. And I want to play again knowing more what I'm doing. It's euroish wargame, not too heavy but you need to make decisions which are not always obvious. I would like to like it more and I hope I will after more plays.

2015-12-05 - 7->6 - Unfortunately I get tired playing this one. All the upgrades are cool, but when I get a good set of them I cannot use it efficiently at all. Again it's a game I would like to like and everything in it seems really good, but when I play I feel helpless.

2015-12-27 - 6->5 - I just feel tired thinking about playing Kemet. That's a shame, because I had high expectations for this game, but I'm glad that I came across Nexus Ops which does what I hoped Kemet would do.

2016-11-23 - 5->4 - I saw Kemet on the table a week ago and realized how much I do not want to play this game.

Bad rules, the FAQ has 5 pages because the rulebook is sooooo bad and lack of information that you simply play the game entirely wrong for the first or second time.

Powers are just "pick and go" and previously players always will pick the right creatures first. Upgrades rules are kind of nonsense.

Love this area control/war game; It has great battle mechanics that doesn't use the RNG of dice but rather a clever card system that works out great since you have to give up one card and play another until your deck runs out. With a bit of sleight of hand that may trick up your opponent. For example you have 2 vs 4. Your opponent may think they have it in the bag but low and behold you just played a card that's higher attack and you also defend damage and better yet you have these card called divine intervention and now you don't take any damage as well or you make your opponent automatically lose some of his dudes so now he even less to fight with. plus a great system that allows the loser of the fight to move a space or run away like a coward all the way back to base but hey, no shame in being a coward because the game allow you to get prayer point which you need to get things done in this game just for doing that!
Depending on what strategy your going with you start the game with your choice red/blue/white/black(if you have the expansion)powers that allow you to make you have better abilities that get even better as you upgrade your powers.Things like getting more troops for the price of less or just gain a victory point because why not? Other joyful abilities allow you to have creatures of egyptian mythology at your troops side to boot which is nice because they stick around even if you've loss the fight they just go back on their respective card until you have more dudes to bring out. 
So much love about this game, it's phenomenal, and I highly recommended it for anyone's board game collection.

Solid area control/war game with a euro feel. My only gripe is I would have liked to have a variable set-up with this game. Without a variable set-up, I see many games devolving into similar lines of play. Early offense translating into mid-to-late defense. There is enough to explore here to prove me wrong though. Only more plays will figure out if certain powers are imbalanced.

Great game. Balanced, deterministic, asymmetric. Scales very well with player count.
Not big fan of the theme.

My biggest gripe with the game is that the tile powers are 99% passive, would love to see a set of well implemented, asymmetrical active powers. 
I understand the need for passive powers from the game balance point of view, I just don't like them.

Played at Essen 2012 and bought it instantly, a bit overpriced but is reallly a great game, fast peaced and without bids and dice, the only dice that the game have is the ones used to represent the pyramids and you turn them to represent the pyramid level.

Really nice minis, especially the ones of the mythical creatures. Very tense game 3 or 4 player can win the game and the late game, it feels like cyclades.

Attack is a must in this game, you can't win without going into combat. The combat system is by cards , much like game of thrones boardgame 2nd edition but the mythicakl powers you can buy give the game a very deep strategical choices.

RATING: 7
Here's the thing: I love the mechanics of this game so much that they defeat the memorization and analysis paralysis aspects. 

Kemet's mechanics are smart and they yield a different play experience every time. Yes, certain moves are highly preferred (especially Level 3 conditions from each color), but aside from White's free pyramid advancement card nothing gives a player a runaway advantage. Furthermore, this game is the perfect anti-turtle-er - you never have reason to sit in one place once you max your troops there. Plus, there's a variable base of Victory Points in play at any given time, meaning even someone's sure victory can be quickly disassembled in a handful of moves.

Playing out of those mechanics at the table that drags this down at bit. You have to have all three colors of tech tree tiles committed to memory to make good choices from the beginning (or, constantly have your nose in the reference sheet). Furthermore, even after you have all the possibilities memorized or have a good crib sheet, you must constantly survey your opponents' tiles to understand their shifting powers - this is a major pain. I'm considering making a tablet of Clue-esque tally cards to keep track of an opponents permanent battle bonuses granted from their tiles.

On the plus side, there is no luck present here aside from the initial turn order and distribution of Divine Favors, which is pretty remarkable! I'm strongly in favor of the idea of a fixed bank of battle cards that endlessly recycles with further stratification in both the cards and creatures. (The Cyclades crossover expansion helps with this slightly by doubling the available creatures.)

On the downside, high quality components are plagued by a few bad design decisions. The Divine Favor cards have the same background on the front and back, making it a chore to sort through a stack where some are reversed. Action tokens bounce and roll across the room after the slightest nudge - no game material of that size and heft should be perfectly round! The game board feels overly large for how many units will need to occupy each territory, and the art is overly sharp and contrast-y compared to smooth illustrations elsewhere.

Most-crucially, the battle cards should have been cardboard, linen, or even a non-fraying plastic or Tyvek. These are a mere six cards per player that will likely get handled extensively, slammed down, and picked back up in every round of every game. Leaving aside the lack of randomness from seeing the same worn cards over and over, I simply don't think these 30 cards are built to withstand the level of play they'll be seeing as people become addicted to this game! While I'm happy to throw protectors on them, given the game mechanics they should have been something other than uncoated playing cards.

Kemet is a nice counter-balance to Cyclades - way more options and rules, but constant action instead of biding your time and bidding on gods. However, get ready to settle down for lengthy sessions in your first handful of plays as people spend minutes at a time pouring over the tile options in each round.

Like Cyclades, it's simple to learn, but difficult to master. The tile upgrades are an interesting mechanic, as is the action-selection mechanic. Fast and brutal, it rewards aggression, which is a good thing in my book.

Seems like a refined Nexus Ops with Cyclades' production, but with a bunch of up front complexity thrown at you in the form of stacks of power tiles. It seems like a better game than Nexus Ops to me but the complexity of absorbing all the power tiles basically makes it a multi-game commitment with the same people to get the most out of it. It plays quickly and packs a solid experience but I'm as yet not sold on if the power tiles are worth such a hassle. I'd recommend it if you have a group that isn't so large your opponents are different every game, and you like to beat up on each other. I'd have to teach this game probably 10 times before I got a game where everyone was up to speed, and I don't see that being worth it.

The mechanics, the art and the components of this game supposedly are the best that I ever demand in a board game (low-luck, beautiful art and nice minis).

I still have some hopes for the game though, definitely needs more plays.

In Kemet, players each deploy the troops of an Egyptian tribe and use the mystical powers of the gods of ancient Egypt – along with their powerful armies – to score points in glorious battles or through invasion of rich territories. A game is typically played to 8 or 10 victory points, which may be accrued through winning attacks, controlling temples, controlling fully-developed pyramids, sacrificing to the gods, and wielding particular magical powers.

One of my favorite war games. Since everyone is so close and you can purchase your units back with ease it really helped alot of my gamers to step up their aggressive play. If you enjoy war games but never very aggressive, PLAY THIS GAME! It will help you to be aggressive in war games, which is what you're suppose to be. Plus can't beat the theme!

Good area control game with the Game of Thrones combat-deck mechanic and minimal engine building. Nice models but ugly game board. Has a major problem with Kingmaking: most games are so close, one of the losing players ends up "choosing" who wins the game. This feels bad and is the same reason I vowed never to play Power Grid again. Poor design. Play Scythe instead.

Kemet debuts at an 8. I wasn't interested at all until a stellar review from Shut Up & Sit Down convinced me to try it. It's an absolute blast, and has caused me to outline some game theory / mechanics blog posts :).

If it is still a ton of fun after a few more plays, it will go to a 9.

December 2013 - Kemet's star has seriously faded after a number of high-commitment plays. The available tactical space is quite a bit smaller than it had at first appeared. It is still tremendous, stomping fun, but it is a pity that there are so few truly great synergies in the upgrades.

This game really learns from its spiritual antecessor Cyclades, making combat a much more worthwhile and interesting choice, also more strategic with cards instead of dice. Mythological creatures are more valuable here as well. It's amazing and full of brutal combat. So many power tiles available at once is a bit overwhelming, but the icons are good; we soon got used to them. Complements Cyclades nice, both are great and feel quite different. Excellent!

You can definitely feel the shared DNA that Kemet shares with it's cousin [gameid=54998]. I must say though that for all of the improvements to the game I really wish they would have balanced out another path to victory with the Attacking/Red strategy. The race to get the best creatures usually will let you know who the victor will be in your game. Unfortunately this just makes the game much more samey feeling to me the times I have played it. I will say that overall it is more streamlined game than [gameid=54998], but in this case that doesn't necessarily make it better. If given the choice between the two I am pretty sure I would Kemet's older cousin. Components and artwork are all great, and the cardplay is interesting. I just wish they would have made the game a little bit more rounded that what it is.

Clever multiplayer war game that solves the turtling issue by giving a strong incentive to starting combat but still has some of the king making problems that most games of this genre are plagued by. The different tech trees offer some ability to vary one's strategy but ultimately the game seems to devolve into having enough movement to get a good strike force into position to attack any enemies who can be reached during your turn.

+ Very desirable powers on tiles.
+ The rules are quite streamlined. 
+ Nice decisions during combats (choice of cards).
+ The minis are nice looking (painted a bit) and are really used (instead of being only used sparingly as in Cyclades, or of sitting on the side of the board too much like in Blood Rage).

Negative points:
- Since combat requires decisions, they are a bit long for the players who are not involved. Nothing too bad, though. 

We did not fight for pyramids. Maybe we missed something, maybe this is not so relevant?

I find it richer than Cyclades, which revolves a bit too much on auctions instead of actions, and where creatures don't stay as long on the board. Since Cyclades does not work so well with two, maybe I should have this instead of it.

This is not the kind of game I can usually connect with and do competently in. However, I do like Chaos in the Old World, and this one reminded me of that a lot, only with technologies and giant dung beetles. It's a messy, pile-on-the-leader-pick-off-the-weak slugfest but it works. It also does what it does at a surprisingly quick pace, which is nice.

I want to play it more, and especially 2 player before giving it a rating.  I like that it rewards attacking, the variety of the tile powers, and how it does combat with cards rather than dice.

This is the perfect wargame with a bit of a Euro flavor playable within 3 hours with the maximum amount of players.
I played this 3 times in 2 days now and it's the only thing I can think about. "What powers will I try to buy next time?" "I wonder if that combination of powers would work well", etc...
You only have a maximum of 12 units but still there is so much in this game ! 
The game components are also top notch.
The only potential problem is when there is a weaker player he can decide who will win the game by not knowing what he is doing (giving points to others by combat or randomly placing the turn order), hence no 10. Maybe the starting position is a weakness too but not much you can do about this.
I so want to buy this NOW, and play this again NOW !

RATING: 7
Hypothetically, this game should have been golden for me: a mythology theme, combat mechanisms that should disincentivize turtling while the battle cards allowing for both strategy and nondeterministic results, and cool upgrades to your army/economy. I can't really point my finger on what it is, but somehow this game just isn't as fun as the sum of its parts. 

EDIT: I think what I dislike about this game is I want the spatial aspect to be more important, but the teleportation makes it so that while there is area control, movement and positioning are, while still significant, more minor. Also while you can change up your strategy from game to game depending on how you start your pyramids this game lacks any variable setup.

Great 'Dudes on a Map' game. I really enjoy these types of games.  All of the powers you can buy are really interesting and enticing which leads to lots of fun choices.  I am worried about the King Making factor of the last round. It is usually clear who is close to getting 8 points for Victory and the player in last can usually swing the game in favor of certain players.  I will need more plays to see if that happens more.

This might be the quintessential dudes on a map game. It's all about the tech and combat. If you're shy of conflict, you need not apply. Another great part of the game is that it doesn't overstay it's welcome; there are just too many ways to get points for that to ever happen.

My favorite "dudes on a map" game. It's just modern and smart all the way down and has so many satisfying and fun things to do, great double and triple bluffs in the combat, and ends while everyone is still having fun (unless you play with 5). The map feels so open and like a big sandbox to mess with your friends on, and you can explore a different "build" of power tiles every game.

Three tips:

1. Don't let the player in the lead go last.
2. Don't just build up power tiles, or it will feel like a sedate Euro.
3. Print a power tile reference for every player, because for some stupid reason the game only includes one copy.

Only played two learning games, but shows a lot of promise.  I really liked the combat cards in aGoT, so they seemed good here.  Movement is a little wonky, since there is teleportation and not very many areas anyways.  Definitely am interested in trying this with more players.  Has potential for replacing Nexus Ops as my multi-player dudes-on-a-map go-to game.  The power tiles seem to present too high a learning curve, though.

Really a gamer's game of wargaming - it trims out all the boring parts, there's no multiple turns of slowly moving into position, and that not wanting to be the first to start the shit-slinging, it skips that.  The game doesn't drone on in the end, all the fun already happened but the game's not finished yet, it ends as you're still having fun, before you're finished with it, and you want to start again.  But it's difference from Cyclades and makes it a "gamer's game" (versus something more accessible to get someone new to a wargame to try) is that it has so many different options for strategies, and is so tightly efficient, that if you spend the first few turns just flubbing about and not having a set strategy yet, you've wasted half your game to no avail.

Seems great, very interested, but would definitely only be for those that love systems and figuring out how to work them into winning strategies.

It’s a nice feeling when reviews on a new game give you that excited feeling that somebody made a game especially for you, and they made it well. No turtling, short play time, strategy plus lots of clobbering, and a great presentation to wrap it all up. It’s even better when the game does not disappoint after you made the leap and bought it, especially when a target of less than 10 new purchases per year is limiting your margin for error.

An immediate hit in our group, Kemet is a mixture of innovation and thorough development. Things flow smoothly once you've grokked the symbols for the action cards, and I could not think of anything that does not work as well or better than I expected from reading the rules. Admittedly, the 4-cost power tiles don’t see such a lot of action, but I guess that the longer game (10 instead of 8 VP) would rectify that. Since it’s not a real problem right now – still too much to explore at the lower tiers of power – we’ll see about that in good time.

For now, I can just heartily recommend Kemet, especially to anyone who is intrigued after reading the rules or a review, but still on the fence. I held out for over a year in the hopes that I would have an occasion for a test run, and really should have caved in a good deal earlier.

What a weird game.  I have nothing to compare it to.  It's mean, but there are other paths to victory beyond dicking over other players.  You can be losing the whole way, and be competitive at the last moment.  Very interesting.  Probably not for everyone, but worth a play if you like good design.

RATING: 5
Pros:
- Visuals great: map, men, creature models, art style on cards.
- I liked the cycle of sacrificing and resurrecting men.
- I liked the pyramid structure for move choices and constraints.

Cons:
- Last couple rounds in the game I found choices really narrowed: all cards were bought, all pyramids upgraded, prayer points no longer being spent as quickly as they're acquired... so 5 turns really only gave 2-3 useful moves (moving twice, possibly resurrecting). Having both silver and gold tokens for extra moves didn't improve things either. Because of this, ending felt repetitive rather than exciting.
- Ending of game also dragged because of back-and-forth for temporary points, as people tried to delay the game until within possible winning range. Because of this, we played two more rounds than expected, even though winner was ultimately not altered.
- Throughout the game, bringing in all 12 men at the same time was mostly useless (excepting the one person who had the legion card) since, unless part of a 5-group, my men just gave opponents an easy target for 1 permanent victory point, so seemed only worth doing very temporarily (i.e. one-time push for a vital point, knowing they'd be sacrificed). I think greater flexibility here would've been far more interesting.
- Battles were rarely tense, usually clear who would win. I know the cards modified this somewhat, but as bonuses developed (e.g. who has creature, who has card bonuses, who has DI cards), the actual gap was usually too significant. In the whole game, there was only one upset (out of easily 30+ battles).

An excellent game - one that prompts a lot of reflection after each game.  Dudes on map with a tech tree, prayer point economy, victory point scoring for satisfying different conditions, and changing turn order too. Plays fast - no wasted time on troop deployments, just charge in, strike and fade.  Different play styles available depending on the tech upgrades (some dynamite combos) Ends in a late game rush, with some chance of king making, so timing and turn order are crucial and positioning is all important.  Reminiscent of Antike in terms of the end game feel.  Great components, art and figures.

RATING: 10
Awesome area control strategy game. Somewhat fiddly. Asymmetry through powers obtained in the course of the game. Multiple combos that offer different paths to victory. Combat decided by troops plus cards. Requires a lot of planning. Learning to play the turn-order-track-game is more important than I think it should be. Still, one of my favorites.

Competent area control, action selection game.  Heavily incentivizes combat, which is nice in conjunction with the high mobility.  Of course I could do without the minis, but the special creature sculpts are pretty good.

I do like the distinction between winning the battle and retaining units.  Buying special powers is a bit of a pain but I'm sure they drive further study of the game.

RATING: 9
Amazing game. Aggressive and quick, and equally rewards long term planning/optimization and tactical adaptation to changing board positions and threats. The powers and upgrades are compelling, and the combat is fast and rewarding, removing luck for the most part (no dice) while remaining dynamic through the use of card play.

Rating after one play. 

Really enjoyed this game. It's fast paced, and really keeps all players engaged at all times. Will definitely be bringing this one back to the table. 

Score remains the same after second play. I really like this game, but the rule book is simply awful. 

I would likely rate this an eight, but there is a bit too much frustration created by the subpar rule book. 



That having been said, the designers have been extremely good about answering questions here on BGG.  That helps mitigate things quite a bit.


Update:  I played this with the full complement of five, and wanted to gouge out my eyes.  It took more than four hours to finish.  Never again will I play this with more than three, which seems to be a real sweet spot.

Kemet is an outstanding game of war within a well developed egyptian atmosphere and with a luck aspect pretty absent. Even though the game is language independent there are several rules and many icons to catch, so the learning curve can be steep; the market of power tiles is the core of the game, it holds a lot of possibilities and gives high replayability to the title. Mechanisms, materials and theme, everything in this game seems right and very well connected to me.

[b]2015-11-18 9.5[/b] After 3x 2p 3x 5p:
Typically not a fan of race games (first to score 8 VP's win) but Kemet has a rather special temporary points system. Since permanent points are harder to come by, it is easier to hold back the leader with attacks and at the same time gain aggression points yourself. Absolutely love the deterministic battle cards (DI card draw is random but stronger ones cost prayer points to use) as I quite strongly dislike combat dice. The board cleverly puts every player at equal distance and the power tiles are diverse but balanced. Absolutely love this game and every session does feel different.

For me, this is THE dudes on a map game. It  looks like some Stargate movie qua atmosphere (teleporting etc) and the strategy is right there. Different opening strategies makes for a always different game. Should play this one more, definetly like it more than Blood Rage.

I was pleasantly surprised with this one.  It's a good approach for casual warmonger since the game is not hard to teach and cool to play.  

Would definitely play it again.

So, this is what Nexus Ops feels like if you build it around a worker placement engine... it works brilliantly. Kemet keeps the brutality of the wrestling in a tight space, rewards offensive play, but the different unit types got replaced by customizable global upgrades and legendary units. Fast, clever, smooth, balanced.

Quite enjoyed the one play I had, my friends less so & so I didn't waste the money buying it because it would be very unlikely to see the table again.

The game rewards aggression which in a multi-player is a nice thing to see.

Another buddy of mine introduced me to this and he absolutely spanked us. Come to find out it’s one of his fav games. It has become one of my favs too. Love the area comtrol and allows for a balance of aggressive play as well turteling. It’s hard for a noob to win amongst players experienced with this game, but strategies come alive after multiple games. One of the few “war games” my wife likes so that is a plus as well.

Not really my typical type of game, but I really enjoy how this feels like a good mix of an ameritrashy are control "dudes on a map" game and also a strategic action-point tech-tree eurogame.  Play is generally quick but rewarding, the battle system is clever, and the overall presentation is great.  It's a bit long to teach, but fairly intuitive once you get going.  Some of the icons aren't obvious so some reference sheets are helpful.

Aggressive and strategic.  Combat is encouraged and rewarded, but losing a battle is not punishing.  Lots of powers and strategies to choose, but that selection doesn't change from game to game. Rule book or reference is likely needed.  Potential for political play and "kingmaking" like most similar games.

RATING: 6
Build pyramids, develop knowledge, control temples, move units and fight others for most points.

Plays: 1.
Type: VP race = a game where you race to collect victory points (fastest/most).
Complexity: Medium.
# of players: See BGG.
Playing time: See BGG.
Player interaction: Competition for scarce resources – temples and knowledge. Competition for unlimited resurces - pyramids. Conflict. 
Randomness: Low – event cards, but they are not decisive.

Replayability: Average. It’s one of the quickest civilization games I’ve seen. If you like civ games but don’t like to spend all day, you can still fit in a couple of sessions. I’m not so sure about depth though. As civ games go, this is shallow.
Fun: Average. Improving your faction is fun. Taking developments that give you cool miniatures is fun. 
Memorability: Low. It’s too short to create a story about your civilization. At heart it’s a VP engine.

Thematic integration: Average. The art and presentation does a good job communicating the theme. But it doesn’t feel like the civilization game it wants to be. It feels like a VP engine with a civ theme.
Components: Very cool. This game speaks to my inner 15-year old. The miniatures of different Egyptian-themed creatures are awesome. The game looks great set up. The bits are definitely the best thing about this game. From a playability standpoint I don’t like the player boards, as there’s too much risk of accidentaly bumping the tiny markers.

Who will like this: Teenage boys.

A játék kétségkívül hangulatos. Elsőre picit csalóka: hiába van sok akció lehetőség, mégis (főleg a játék felétől) kevésnek éreztem. A harc jól ki van találva, ezerszer jobban értékelem, mint kockákkal dobálózni.

A hatalom lapkák legalább felületes ismerete (előzetesen) megkönnyíti a játékot, mert nélkülük nehéz tervezni, már az elején fejvakarás, amikor a piramisok induló erejét kell eldöntenie az egyszeri játékosnak.

A játék hossza pont ideális, se nem hosszú, se nem rövid, pont mire már beleunalmasodna, egyszer csak véget is ér.

Első játék után nem egy világmegváltó, bár kétségkívül jól össze van rakva és van benne néhány egyedi(nek tűnő) megoldás (pl. harcrendszer, piramisok fejlesztése, kreatúrák, stb).

Enjoyable game.  I think it will take several plays to get a better grasp of all of the tiles you can purchase and all of the Divine Intervention cards.  You need that to understand all of the synergies that exist.  I did enjoy the enouragment towards player interaction with permanent victory points coming from attacking (and winning).  Surpringly we almost exclusively used teleportation on our movement actions, and thus, the non-obelisk positions on the board were largely unoccupied throughout the game.

RATING: 7.9
Sometimes it’s interesting to play with different groups. I tried Kemet with a group who had played it a couple of times before and it was a bit of a surprise all around. These guys are real ‘engine builders’ whereas I took the approach that as this game rewards aggression (A VP to winners only if they are the attacker) had me attack early and often and try to build up my collection of power tiles to support this strategy. As it turned out I inflicted enough damage on a couple of the other players that their early plans were scrapped and they had to contend with me on the battleground rather than the technology tree thingo. I didn’t win in the end, but did come second and had a ball taking the fight to my opponents.

I enjoyed playing this Ameritrash game and would recommend it to anyone who wants a symmetrical game of conflict where turtling is penalised. The components are pretty nice too; initially I thought the little plastic warriors might be abit too small, but I came to understand they were about the right size for what they needed to do. The constructs are also rather fun.

I would consider purchasing this but would be concerned how much table time it would get.

Excellent game. Fast and tactical, but the tech trees really add an extra dimension, unlike in some games where they just feel tacked on. The tech upgrades (using the term "tech" loosely since we're talking about mythical creatures, divine powers, etc) are not just an addendum to the game, they're an integral part that's impossible to ignore. 

I also love that the tech upgrades come from a common pool, forcing the players to compete for them, rather than everyone having their own tech tree that they can explore at their leisure. This, combined with the fast pace of the game, makes for an intense fight. You can't just focus on what's happening on the map, nor can you ignore the map and just focus on grabbing tech upgrades. You have to do both simultaneously, and do it quick and decisively lest one of your opponents beats you to the punch. 

I love area control games, even though I'm terrible at them because of my natural tendency to turtle. This game in particular does NOT reward turtling, and that's a good thing. I'd really love to get some more plays of this, to break my turtling habit and eventually maybe even eke out a win.

RATING: 6.8
Civilization building, area control, tactical combat, cool minis and an Egyptian theme in a game that can be played in 60 - 90 minutes.  It takes a few gameplays before everything comes together and goes quickly & smoothly.  

2015-06:  Traded it away.  My gaming group never really took to this.  After 6 plays, I felt like it was just OK.  The movement is so abstracted as to be completely non-tactical: you can pretty much get to wherever you need anytime you want.  What this means is that the game  becomes one of building up resources using a dull action selection mechanism and then fighting in an anti-climactic & deterministic combat system.

If you're into army-based conquer-them-all games (which frankly I'm not), this might be one of the best choices out there. I love Egyptian/fantasy theme, the components are gorgeous and while this game is often compared to Cyclades due to similar looks, this thing is genuinely more fast-paced and combat-based.
Here you get to do things every turn - not just wait until you are able to pay for a god that you wanted.

After years of play this one is back as my #1 game. I gravitate towards games with very little luck and this satisfies that in a simple system that makes complete sense to me. For those that enjoy combat without virtually any luck I believe this is a must have. 

My cons keeping it from 10 stars is that it has a huge learning curve for a new player. They are flooding with too many technology tiles at once that require reference sheets to understand. I do believe parts of the expansion are must haves that would have been nice in the base game - the extra 2 battle cards alone are crucial to me. The final negative is that I believe that there are a few under-costed or over-costed tiles which limit the amount of variety the game could have had otherwise.

Cool miniatures and the monsters with their special powers are a nice touch, otherwise I wasn't a huge fan. It felt a bit chaotic, even though there is very little luck involved. Maybe that's the thing: I tend to freeze a bit playing area control games like this, because I feel like I should count and optimize the moves ahead for the whole game, since all knowledge is basically public. But I can't, of course, do that. That is what the whole concept of the game is counting on; there are probably too many things to keep in mind. But there is still something weirdly deterministic about the game. I'd rather play Game of Thrones, in which the bluffing, diplomacy and simultaneous actions make the world of difference.

If you love conflict, this game is for you. If not, stay far, far away. Kemet is a pretty solid combat game, but the problem is, Blood Rage exists. Blood Rage does everything Kemet does in a far better way. There are two major differences between the two. Blood Rage allows you to draft upgrades in a fairly equal manner, while Kemet makes you purchase them. Kemet is also strictly about combat and territory control, while Blood Rage is about getting points. Sometimes that requires conflict, but not always. Both games are effectively two sides of the same coin, but I would much rather play Blood Rage.

Quite a fancy piece of strategy game in my opinion. Rules are simple so people get on the track right away. Lots of strategies to choose and build, but after a few matches, they are quite easy to be guessed. To solve this, we use our house rules: flip down all the power tiles so we all purchase them randomly; we had so much fun when ridiculous combos appear (:

C3K expansion is cool, but it costs another Cyclade copy to make the most of the expansion.

I heard another expansion is coming this year, in about 3 months hence, really looking forward to buying it.

RATING: 3
Kemet is a peculiar hybrid of conflict, engine builder and race. While this works OK in games like Scythe, Kemet limits all victory point sources except winning conflicts (and you're able to teleport to virtually any conflict). Hence, what could have been a game of building up a strong power and outmaneuvering your opponents is reduced to build an army, fight a conflict and rebuild an army until someone eventually has enough victories. The fiddly battle system with secret strength cards and multiple modifiers from the technology tree is merely distracting and gives no sense of progress.

RATING: 10
Since it looks like such a fun area control game with high theme and I love those (chaos in the old world), I'd really want to play this one. I don't think I would need too many of this type of game to be satisfied so I'm happy with chaos in the old world and even eight minute empire as my token area control games. If I got more, they would be shorter since I have a much higher priority and allow for more purchases of shorter games. aka, if the game is longer, it takes a long more scrutiny for me to make the decision to buy it. That being said, I'd enjoy playing this one to see what it's like.

UPDATE:

For straight up battles, skirmishes, cool powers, great theme, and an overall fast-paced conquest game that rewards fighting and punishes slow/turtle play, this one is the best. This replaces all traditional risk-style conquest games for me (not including the excellent area control game of Chaos in the Old world) for people who want to send armies in to fight each other and take territory, Kemet is king!

When buying, considering get spare red level 4 spare to replace initiative?

Played a two player game which was okay. I think I would like this with more players. We also misplayed with having more than one monster per army which strong just changed the flow of the game, as the snake would go on to cancel all the other monsters effects, which made my strategy ineffective. It was also my first time.

I think the rule book for this game could have explained things a bit more clearly. I also wish the tiles were randomized and only a subset were out because I heard that theres the same general strategies and combos used (like in Caverna). Otherwise, the way combat worked was good, though I wish the numbers on the battle cards had names (like "balanced attack" or "all out offensive" or "a strong defense is a strong offense") and the numbers were a bit more differentiated. It becomes very calculated, tediously checking an opponents strength and potential for damage and such.

What I think I disliked most about the 2p game is that at a certain point, I simply could not win the game. I probably would like it more multiplayer, but I also think I may not enjoy the attacking and destruction as much possibly, as well as semi-limited replayability I expect. Still, its probably one of the best combat game I have ever played, beating out Cyclades and some others. Still not planning to get this, though I may one day. I had also played Suburbia and enjoyed that more today.

Plays: 1

Played more after owning and enjoyed a lot more totaling 7 plays. Low luck high strat and high interaxtion make for a fun experience

EDIT: 12+ more plays and feels stale and samey. I think I burnt out on this after this dozen ish plays because it feels a lot more stale/samey. The initial DIs aren't enough to vary the start and almost everything else is the same. I wish there was more variance on the board, like the temples offered something/variable setup or an official variant where players started with tiles. That and its still a bit of a table hog, albeit thats not the biggest concern per se. I also wish there wasnt an obvious best "4" power card - it leads to more samey plays in the beginning. It just feels a lot more stale atm, and I prefer the streamlinedness of a total euro atm.

Great game, lots of interaction, interesting choices, multiple strategies to do, very tactical, we must adapt us to the other players. The game is not too long (no more than 1h30, even with 4 players I think), relatively easy to learn. The end can be abrupt cause conditions of victory can arrive fast but it prevents the game drag on. We often want to do another play just after.

Much, much better design than Cyclades, full stop. However...

There is only one thing that I detest more in a game than having someone tell me how to play (ie. the co-op mechanic): kingmaking at the end of a cutthroat conflict. Although it is hard to say after just a couple of plays but unfortunately Kemet seems like a game with a valid potential for just that. I also found the battle system a bit lacklustre or, should I say, too eurogamey...?

Anyway, production values are stunning, monster sculpts are far the most beautiful I have ever seen in a board game and the art is awesome.

With Kemet's huge emphasis on attacking, complex upgrade market and card-based warfare, an experienced player will slaughter any newcomers to the game. Worse still, to the newbies it will definitely feel like they lost due to their own incompetence.

The Egyptian theme in Kemet is so flimsy as to be almost non-existent. I feel the designers had no theme at all before one of them saw the pyramidal shape of the 4-sided dice the game uses as counters and shouted "Eureka! Egypt!". Kemet's teleportation and monsters feels more like the movie Stargate than actual Egypt.

RATING: 7
This is quite an awesome war game as war games go.  Acquire points by winning fights, buying the correct buildings, owning/conquering temples, and having a 4 score pyramid.  The buildings were the most intriguing part of the game to me, because there was a wealth of interesting tactical and strategic routes you could go.  

My problem with war games is that I don't like to pick on people, and I do not like to be picked on.  Inevitably I will not only lose war games going defensive, but my pathetic retarded feelings get hurt in the meantime.  Ultimately in a war game the 'better' players are going to take advantage of the 'weaker' players and I am not a fan.  I always tend to feel like I was just a ring in the ladder for the winner to step on and over to win, and I don't get much enjoyment out of that in the end.

If I liked war games this would be rated higher, but as it stands this is a solid 7 that I would play again in the future when the mood strikes.

I do enjoy this game, though I'm not positive it is better than Cyclades. I do really want to try the crossover expansion though and see how it fares. Probably my biggest complaint about this is the set up time for all the different tiles.

RATING: 8.7
An unflinchingly aggressive area control game with asymmetrical development of player powers? With grand battles and virtually no luck? With MONSTER SCULPTURES? Yes please! My only reservation is that with Kemet's fixed setup, skilled players may be constrained to a handful of dominant strategic paths.

Gioco con un componentistica molto bella grazie soprattutto alle miniature delle creature che si possono assoldare per le proprie campagne. Grazie a una serie di tessere speciali e alle loro combinazioni, il gioco è molto longevo e si presta a differenti tattiche. Forte interazioni dove è necessario darsi le botte! Il gioco però è un po' affetto da kingmaker e questo aspetto me lo fa piacere un tantino meno. Semplice da apprendere e simpatico da giocare.

RATING: 7
This is a deep, deep game for how simple it is to learn due to the diverse and game changing Power Tiles. If your group enjoys running in and slapping each other around for a little while before somebody wins, than I can see how this would be a fast (90 min) game for you. However, my gaming group is a euro heavy one, and we analyze all our moves. Which means this game slows down to a crawl. Beautiful components, beautiful artwork, solid gameplay, great depth, but it just continuously overstays its welcome. Perhaps we should try it with less people and see if that works better.

Made me think of a euro-fied Nexus Ops with card based combat resolution, longer play time, heavier, deeper and more convoluted. In-your-face aggressive "dudes on a map" with a tech tree. Still, in the end, it's a optimizing game that comes down to victory points. I'd prefer more randomness. Would be much better with dice instead of cards, for example. Too deterministic, too strategic... but yeah, I enjoyed my first session and would rather play Kemet instead of Cyclades, to name another popular hybrid.

[b]Kemet[/b] was traded away for Suoer Motherload 6/2/15. 

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I traded this game because it is such a bear to set up and teach, but I would play it anytime. I still think it is a great game, just not a great fit in our small collection. I've completely changed my mind and would rather set up and play Nexus Ops if I want a quick skirmish game and Memoir when we're looking for a longer game. Also if I had one negative I would say that the tiles are a red herring, you really can't get more than a few because you need to be grabbing points and someone else will run away with the game (just ask my son : )[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (9):[/COLOR]

[i]- Beautiful production quality, especially the minis.
- Love the action selection board where you can only select certain actions once or maybe twice each turn.
- Turns are quick, this game moves along at a brisk pace.
- The pyramids/power tiles in the game add a lot of replay value to the game.
- Creatures have diverse powers and add a lot variety to the battles.
- Divine intervention cards add a layer of unpredictability to the game especially during battles.
- There is no player elimination, you win by having x number of victory points.
- Kemet discourages players from turtling, the majority of victory points are earned by being the attacker in battles. 
- Great combat resolution mechanic with the card system.[/i]

Tons of choices, card based combat, variable and interesting player powers, nice minis, so many things to like! At first I thought that I wouldn't like how in your face this game is. On the contrary, since everyone is so close to each other, I feel like it really balances out. This is a game to avoid if you like to turtle. Kemet is a game that rewards aggression. However the tiles really make this game great, as in each game you can create a strategy, and there are many different an viable paths to go.

打不贏的時候就要削弱別人的兵
士兵上限15隻也是一個很大限制
戰爭遊戲而言算是相當不錯的

1. 拿兩個祈禱點數
2.升級金字塔 付對應等級的祈禱點數，一次只能升級一種，但可升多級，四級金字塔可拿暫時分數 (如果金字塔被別人控制，該玩家獲得所有好處)

I wanted to like it, the concept is good, it just didn't pull it off for me. It's all about the tech's, and what's more it seems to be all about the attack-based techs. Because successful attacks are going to earn you VP's (Nexus Ops style), and even if you buy defense-based techs, you'll still be attacked by attacks with numbers + techs that are mostly guaranteed to win. It just might take them an extra troop or two, and it doesn't help you win. It feels like Game Of Thrones with all the chit based gumpf stripped away. Here, you move, you attack with the similar GoT feeling combat cards, you win, you get a VP. First to 8 or 10 VPs wins. Control 2 or more temples to get an extra VP each turn, giving you a reason to attack a temple space over a normal space. Because you get a VP for winning a battle, it encourages attacking the weakest player unmercifully (to win battles more easily with your weakest battle cards), which is never a good trait for a game to have. I liked how your action board forced you to spread out your 5 actions across the 9 options each turn, so each player does roughly the same things - buy techs, recruit, move/battle each round. Which means that once the good tech combos are bought, imposing favourites and non-favourites, it feels like it comes down to who gets picked on the most and who gets picked on the least relative to the perceived strength of the combos. Which introduces a leader-hitting whine-fest. Which is not that appealing to me in the main.

After th first few plays:

It's a really really good looking game. You can buy it only for the figurines, but it also playes very well. It has a lot in common with 4X sci-fi games, even if it's not fully a 4X. 

The game plays in an hour so it's short for a 4X This is done by ending the game after someone has gained 8 (or 10 points). Short games are nice, but this ends with you wanting more. It's also sharing the problem with for example Settlers of Catan that when someone is a few points ahead and is 1-2 points from victory it's difficult to stop him and/or catch up.

Beautiful pieces and superbly designed. The game is deep, balanced, fast-paced, easy to learn and get into (though it's heavier than the average game), allows lots of player interaction while still leaving much space for individual engine building. It's a perfect hybrid of a dudes-on-a-map wargame with an economic technology building Eurogame. A relatively quick, tense and fascinating game that's still challenging after a few games because there are many paths to victory and it's all about doing what's best on the board with the players around you and their strategies.
BUT partly because it's so brilliantly done - not so epic.

1st play was impressive. A lot of 1. tile grabbing and 2. pyramid leveling up, in beginning. Then it just seemed like opportunistic battle after battle.

A LOT more war-euro than I thought it would be.

One thing, notably, in common with Cyclades. It can swing pretty wildly in VP. I was so close to winning and someone swooped from 4 VP to 10 in one final round, tying me, but winning because tie breaker was battle VP. 

So, yeah. Its swingy. 

Know that going in.

This game makes me sad. It makes no difference what you do, there is no interaction or plays to be made, no excitement. You can come up with an intricate plan and follow it, or you can do what you want every turn and it will make no difference. Every available action is balanced specifically to be mathematically equal to any other action without any interactive potential. Optimization strategies are negated by the forced caps on army and prayer.
Kemet also boasts a hilarious amount of redundancies, both in components and mechanics. To list just a few issues:
- Many different kinds of tokens because they didn't bother to design and elegant vp system (it's a multi-step operation at the end of every round)
- Ridiculously oversized map
- Pyramid dice which, while thematic, are both unnecessary and ugly
- Poorly designed low-cap resource system
- There are only 12 units per player, they're identical, and they're used to act out the game's version of military actions in a highly predictable and dry manner

RATING: 7
3 plays - Overall fun, but not all that strategically deep. It is a very streamlined "dudes on a map" experience. The game places various restrictions on the players with limit your strategic options. For example, how many total troops can be recruited and limiting the types of actions players can take. This makes players moves somewhat predictable. 

The strategic elements are in what card(s) you play in battle and how you build up a repotoire of rulebreaking/ power enhancing tiles (either abilities or unique troops). These are probably the most fun part and give you a sense of 'army building' and 'evolving into something unique'. However, you need to layout like 16 tiles for each themed technology (48 or so total). I really dislike games that have this 'mess' around the board and are difficult to place so all players can see. Player aids are much needed, so you can just keep the tiles in a stack near the board and select from a much more player friendly 'menu'. The number of tiles is obviously not new-player friendly either. 

The streamlined gameplay ultimately makes it feel like there's not a lot of depth to your choices, expansion or overall strategy... The game swings quickly, so it doesn't necessarily reward consistently good play, but rather late game swings/ victories. 
While this is probably more fun than I've described (as indicated by rating), there are loads of good area control games I'd rather play aka mare nostrum, chaos in the old world, cthulhu wars, Forbidden Stars, Eclipse, scythe, mission red planet and more. 

Also, this is not a 2p game.

Fun, but doesn't give me the "dudes on a map" experience I'm looking for.

RATING: 6.5
The main mechanic is fairly simple, you must fight others. You can collect powers to help you and time your battles to get the most points during scoring. Everyone is equidistant to everyone else, but you only move one space and are generally fairly weak so you need the special powers to hold off the others. There are a few ways to get points, some are permanent and others are for holding areas so there is a constant back and forth.

This is a multiplayer wargame with simple combat rules and a large technology track.  Like many recent games of its ilk, Kemet strongly rewards combat with victory points for the victor, which makes the "turtling" strategy untenable.  The technology system is a little difficult to wrap your mind around, as most techs are available early, and you can only find out what they do by reading a booklet.  It's a lot to digest.  However, they do provide some nice differentiation among players (though it's somewhat frustrating to find out the tech you wanted is already taken, so you can't get it).  The board is cleverly designed so that players are roughly equidistant--you aren't really closer to your apparent "neighbors".  The game is definitely more involved than something like Nexus Ops, but I'd say a "more involved Nexus Ops" might be a good comparison.

Not horrible, but...

There are too many different techs, and there are no player aids to help so everyone has to hover over the upgrade area. Play a card/discard a card should have been replaced with play a card, refresh when you have exactly one in your hand. Weird disconnect between killing enemy troops and winning. "retreating" your excess losing units back to your supply gives you magic equal to the cost of recruiting them again - what a punishment (sarcasm)!!! Game does not give enough incentive to invade others' home realms. 

There was so much teleporting done back in Egypt, it was like a Dragon Ball Z cartoon. We need a retheme on this game, STAT!

This game is addicting. I brought this game into our card shop and no one there ever likes to try new games. I got a few people playing and it started a small crowed of people watching. By the second game even more people wanted to play. When I tried to leave they asked me to leave the game and i did. they played matches tell the shop closed.

I watched this game for a long time, I am so glad I finally got a copy.

This was a rather enjoyable dudes-on-a-map experience, though our one play ran a little long (~3 hours). At 90 minutes, I imagine an action-packed slugfest. The game really rewards conflict and makes it easy for players to get after one another. The upgrade tiles, which grant permanent special abilities, are really fun and will probably add significantly to the replayability. The components and artwork are vibrant and very high-quality. If you're into this kind of game, definitely check out Kemet.

Me and my groups current favorite game.  It is super simple to learn, yet plenty of depth with power tile combinations.  I have well over 30+ games and I'm still finding new combos.  Plus it's very balanced, not a single pyramid is stronger than the others.

fter about 6 months spent in painting miniatures for creatures and units (on our free time, obviously not full time), organizing sometimes full week-ends in order to keep on painting, we eventually finished and started playing... and it's great! Hallelujah to Matagot and its authors for it!

I've played games at 2 and 5 people, quite different but both nice. At 2 players you can afford to develop a counter-strategy, even in defense, which is also nice. Although of course a good defense is sometimes a good offense. 
At 5 players the game is both longer (we ended up at 3hours with 3 new players) and more chaotic. However you still need to have a strategy if you wanna take the uphold hand at some point and try to keep it. But you also have to be able to adapt a lot, a there's only so much tiles available, and sharing between 5 limits your possibilities pretty fast (The Ta-Seti expansion is quite appreciated for addressing that issue).

The rules are clear, but I confess I spent some time on BGG looking for details or questions that were not addressed in the rulebook, although it always made sense.

Although it was a first, the new player got it very fast and teleportation helping, you get into action pretty fast (after all it is a fight game). 

I love how you can pump up your strength and resources (prayer points) through the tiles, you end up building pretty nice combos that bring a true difference to the battle outcome. 
The creatures speak for themselves, and you always bring a little anxiety to other players when you come to conquer their territory with a giant scorpion!

All in all it's a fantastic game, both pretty simple to get the basis and rich enough so that you can change and adapt strategies a lot. I also recommend the Ta-Seti expansion to add some nice new features to the game, although making it longer.

Hmmmm. Kemet.  Un feel Blood Rage avec les points de prière à dépenser, mais j'avais pas l'impression de jouer à Blood du tout.  Les powers tiles disponible pour achat pour tous sont vraiment biens.  Le jeu me semble bon peu importe le nombre de joueur.  Le board parsit drabe à première vue, mais avec les figurines, les monstres et les pyramides, ça look très bien.  Super cool et des parties serrées.  Très satisfait.

It certainly has similarities with Cyclades, but I think I prefer this one more as there our more ways to score points and going to war is just one of them.

One advice when playing this: if you've lost some troops on a fight away from home base, just withdraw and retroop, as otherwise your opponents can score too easily

This is a good game. Combat favors the aggressors, so there's lots of action, but it's also a very forgiving game and it's easy to recover. Very nice components  as well! Pretty unique topic. Turn order becomes really important in the last round, which can be problematic, but the upcoming expansion is suppose to fix that. Only other thing I'm not sure about is the combat cards. But all told, a pretty good game.

Awesome war game. Building an engine with all the power tiles is addictive fun. Quite possibly the best part of the game in my opinion. Not a fan of the miniatures though. I guess I've been spoiled by other games, but I just find them rather cheap. Doesn't detract from how good this game is though.

Kemet appeals to me in so many ways: I love the Egyptian theme; I love the combat mechanic and the game makes you fight to win; I love the equality of forces and placement on the map; I love how all of our games have been close run things to the end.  What drops it from a "10" is the quality of components in my humble opinion; the spindly troops and the thin cards.  On the other hand the animals are great figures!  It's a great game and I always look forward to playing it.

The kind of game that is great the first time you play it but keeps growing on you the more you explore its options. Great hybrid between a thematic and euro game that goes smoothly once you get familiar with the powers. Can drag with overthinkers, and I found it less accessible than Blood Rage. But it is one of the best area control games out there.

One of the best war game of all time !! A little bit similar to Cyclades, but different in so many ways as this game favours aggressive offensive style.

The depth of this game resides in building and upgrading your army and fight for the Victory. Infinite possibilities on how you want to customize your army: defense, offense, balanced... you decide how you want to go to war & win !!

Also, the combat system is so clever, barely any luck involved. I love the card system.

Incredible depth & replayability, the artwork & the minis are truly the cherries on the cake !!

This is a gamers game. That's the main difference from Cyclades as it's more appealing to casual gamers.

If you are a wargame fan, this is a must.

Fight first, ask questions later. Or never. But fight a lot! It's a quick-paced and always tense game, because regardless of the number of players, they are all within equal reach of each other.

On top of it being a really great tactical and strategic war experience, there's a bunch of powers that you can get and lots of different ways to pursue victory - as I said before however, they all include confrontation.

Interesting game where your job is to attack everyone everywhere all the time. You also don't lose a lot of game progress if you die or are defeated in combat, which is refreshing. The minis are beautiful and the three tech trees you can invest into are very well thought out.

There is an ability for players to take control of other player's homes, although there is a lot standing in their way to do so. I'm tempted to say that the whole thing is unnecessary, and if they wanted a way for players to aggressively benefit from each others pyramid progress, there could be a better way of doing that so you could ignore the whole 'doesn't need to stop for walls' thing. it is fun punting back and forth in and out of temples and victory point areas. It's not fun when your engine gets shut down by a player standing on your house rather than benefiting himself more by standing on points in the field. Again, this eventuality is rare. I've only had it happen to me once, and it ended with the player not involved in that exchange winning, so there you go. Still, why even have it?

It may look like a war game.  It may sound like a war game.  But Kemet is not a war game.  Sure, there's troops.  Yes, there's combat, of sorts.  But don't let that fool you.  Once you get your head around the somewhat arcane iconography, you'll find a deep, rich, tight, cutthroat tactical Euro.  
When playing Kemet, I am, strangely, most reminded of a game like Claustrophobia.  It is a wonderful hybrid of all the things I like about Ameritrash games (cool mini's, variable powers, etc.) blended with the elegance you usually find in your best Euros.  It plays quickly, and is deeply satisfying.  
Absolute recommendation.

First play of it. This game has the things I was looking for when playing Small World, except for races and abilities which Kemet doesn't have it. Feels similar to Rex during the battle phase where I have the number of troops known to the opponent, and I can play a battle card with hidden number of strength, damage, shield, and hidden "Divine Intervention" cards or tiles which I already bought during Day Phase to boost myself during Battle Phase. No leaders and traitors like Rex though, but you can have Monsters accompanying troops to give them variable abilities/buffs.

RATING: 6
A big, ambitious, messy dudes-on-a-map game that just doesn't quite come together. There is a huge number of technology tiles, and you need to understand most or all of them in order to form a strategy and figure out what your opponents are going for. This is not helped by the mediocre iconography and lack of text on the tiles, so players need to constantly consult and pass around the manual just to figure out what their options are. The end condition of getting 8 victory points feels unsatisfying, and the fact that victory points are somewhat scarce causes issues too. Since even a swing of 1 or 2 points is very significant in the last few turns, there is a lot of bashing the leader as everyone tries to prevent whoever is currently in the lead from winning, rather than try to win themselves. This makes the game feel like it comes down too much to the turn order, in a way that can't really be planned for, so the victory seems random and somewhat unearned. The odd movement system feels like it bogs down the game, where you can teleport troops away from their starting location, but after that they move so slowly that it's often not worth bothering with. I almost wanted my troops to die sometimes so I could re-summon them in my base and teleport them out again.
The deterministic card combat is nice though, and gives a nice bit of strategy.

The perfect wargame. Sometimes you just want a game with a ton of battles, and Kemet demands that you fight. The production is insane, from the art on the player boards to the detailed minis with different designs for each faction. The creatures are, of course, my favorite, and I go for the scorpion every time because I can’t help myself. All players start out the same, even equidistant from each other, but with the power tiles everyone will branch out in crazy directions. So much thought and care was put into this game, and it shows. We mainly play with two, but we always have a blast.

Kemet is... fine.
It's well balanced, tactically thoughtful, and the technology upgrade system is clever and nuanced.

It also wasn't very exciting.

It's easy to learn, difficult to completely master, and offers enough strategic options that you could try something new every time.
Mechanically there's nothing I can point out as being unpolished or troublesome.

But I never felt those tense moments of snatching victory from the jaws of defeat, or pride in the empire I had built.  
Somehow the spirit of fun just didn't manifest itself within Kemet's structure, and I'm not sure why.

After another play of this I can say that Im not a fan but I also know now why that is. I dont think I am a fan of games where the leader is CLEARLY determined and then everyone pulls down that one person. Then the next person gets in first and people pull that person down dragging the game out. Also I dont like how the last couple rounds (if its close) can be VERY mathy. Everyone trying to determine everyones points and how each person can get the points they need.

I had a thought that this game could be better if maybe one of the 3-4 forms of victory points was hidden info. This would let players speculate but no hard math could be done to try to "figure out" the game and the ending.

This game is great. This is actually more meaty than Blood Rage I do believe. I like Blood Rage better, but this one throws so much at you. With four players, everyone has some ridiculous powers by about mid way through the game, and trying to maneuver and win battles in the midst of all of these calculations can be even more challenging than some of the other area control games that I love so much. Regardless, this one is probably my fourth favorite area control game. Order is Blood Rage, Rising Sun, Cry Havoc, and Kemet. but all of them are in my top 10 games, so they are all neck and neck with each other as far as how much I love them all. I have yet to try the Godfather. I didn't like Inis.

If I'm going to play a dudes on a map, this one will be right up there. Fast playing time, reasonable numbers of dudes, no economic worries and fast combat. Games are very tit-for-tat, you can get hit anywhere, anytime. Even with the large number of power tiles, it's pretty simple stuff. Just hope you can grab a few permanent VPs before things get rough.

Unsure about card combat. It felt a bit flat. I'm not one for fist full of dice, but I like the thrill of an unexpected defence or big win. 

Wouldn't play it a lot, but would have been GREAT as a 14 year-old, since I detested wind bag games such as Risk. A&A and Supremacy back then.

If I liked war/area control games, I would guess this would be among my favorites. Quick and thoughtful. The upgrade system seems to reward varied strategies and clever tactics.

I am pleased at Kemet's smooth game mechanics and fast play style which results in little downtime. The game had excellent graphics and game parts and the various tiles, DI cards and combat cards adds decent depth and theme to the game meaningfully. The game can be played pretty fast as well at around 2.5 hours and maintains a good tension level throughout the game as it encourages people to attack one another to win. One of the best light-medium weight euro-wargames in my view.

RATING: 7
This is an Ameritrash game  with a lot of Euro mechanisms. Your main objective is to attack other players. The map is very homogeneous, such that there is no way to put your troops in clever positions in order to defend an area, especially  since you can easily teleport to relevant locations (temples, which give you VP). You just stay  at temples or attack opponents at temples. 

I really enjoy combat, in which you use your deck of cards (mostly identical for every player) instead of dice. Especially since winning (for VP) and loosing troops are  two different aspects of fighting. There you can really out-think your opponent. 

The game really shines with all the different power tiles you can purchase and especially the giant creatures. You can really try different strategies and I do not see a completely overpowered tile (Initiative may be nasty to play against, but this does not generate so much VP).

The end game is a bit of a let down, since the being last in turn order in the later (or last) turn is a huge advantage. Very often the leader is bashed, such that there is an additional round, in which the last player very  often can score some easy VP (at empty temples) and gain victory. This in combination with divine intervention cards makes  me consider  Kemet an Ameritrash game with Euro mechanics (rather than the other way round). In future games I need to  adjust my play style and play faster, since there is some danger for AP prone players. Unfortunately, Kemet takes some time to explain and is not easy to get to table with new players because of all the power tiles and divine intervention cards.

Wow this game has a great feel and look to it thematically and I'm impressed with the balance of the board.  There is a lot to digest with respect to strategic options but it was just fun to explore the options.  The most interesting aspect is that this game not only promotes attacking but it greatly rewards it.  The balance of the action choices is great as you really need to react when your option is gone whether is be upgrade or area of attack.  Fun game that looks like a war game but has a eurogame feel.

It's a pleasant surprise to come across a guys-on-a-map game that deftly sidesteps most of the pitfalls of the genre. It's pacy, there's little reason to gang up, and if you turtle you lose. And it doesn't overstay its welcome by a minute. The mechanics are stripped down to a purring and compact engine, and then built up with gorgeous accessories. The special abilities, creatures, and artwork really bring the game to life. Kemet knows exactly what kind of game it wants to be and nails it.

It does seem susceptible to kingmaking, though. In our first game I was in a position where two other players would each win with 10 VP immediately after my turn. I could strike and potentially take a temple from both of them. I chose the one whose army was somewhat weaker, in order to improve my own chances of gaining points. Still, it felt kind of cheesy.

There's an awful lot to like in this game. I like that it's almost all about fighting, but with not a single die to be seen (well, OK, the pyramids look like outsized D4s, but aren't used for that...) - there's actually very little luck in the game (only in which Divine Intervention cards you draw), but lots to think about. The combination of "permanent" and "temporary" victory points also leads to interesting decisions. I don't think this is a classic, and I rarely find myself actively desiring to play it (I haven't played this since 2013, actually), but it's certainly a very good game, and fairly unique too.

It's also extremely pretty and with some excellent miniatures for the many creatures. Perhaps my rating of 7 is too low, but despite all I find to praise in this game, it is not one that I would ever feel like specifically requesting.

This is essentially the battle system from A Game of Thrones the Board game, fleshed out into an entire game. And it works really well. I can't get enough of it. Plays very quickly once players understand the symbols on the power tiles. Has a bit of a learning curve as any other language independent game, but it's completely worth it.

This is a light wargame in Euro clothes.  The item of Euro clothing in particular is an ascot.  It's in your face, but really doesn't serve a purpose and it's just lame.  This is from a Euro game lover's perspective.  If you play it like a Euro, you will lose.  Just get out there and start kicking ass.

While I don't mind conflict per se, this sort of thing is not at all to my tastes. Fiddly, constrained, and over-tactical. I had to spend far too much time consulting lists in order to interpret icons and consider the relative merits of the various tiles. At least it was short(ish). I'm surprised that this game currently stands at 65 in the rankings.

Light war/area of majority game.  There's a basic tech tree with most of the techs being useful, especially the ones that provide the monsters.  Battles are done with attack cards with no dice involved.  You will be attacked and attacking constantly.  Feels more fun than similar themed games like Cyclades and definitely more confrontational.  A war game that I enjoy!

08-06-2014. I have played Kemet a few more times  now. I still love the game, but there is one issue I see. Turn order is really important, but given that the player with the lowest VPs determines player order it's not something you can influence. I have recently played Cyclades, which is somewhat of a sister game to Kemet. I think both are excellent games in their own right, I am leaning a little towards liking Cyclades a little better because you can bid for turn order and there is more tension in bidding for the actions you can take, while Kemet's excitement is mostly in buying the special abilities and the interesting card-driven combat system.

21-02-2014. Area control game, in which you can buy awesome player abilities you can buy. Actions are taken by worker placement, so that you can select each action just as often as is on your board (which are all identical for all players). Kemet can be explained quickly, but takes time to fully master. Awesome game.

RATING: 8.5
Kemet is a king of the hill, dudes-on-a-map game with heavy euro elements. Kemet provides several different sources of victory points and a lot of options for customizing your armies to suit. Since only one type of action token is used for all types of actions (managing resources, specialising your army and maneuvering your army) players are constantly torn between what to do. The game encourages attacking and makes it easy to recover lost units. Highly recommended for those looking for a strategic dudes-on-a-map game.

Combat using miniatures at its finest. This game simply rocks. If you like player versus player combat, you won't be disappointed. To get points in this game, you need to attack your opponents but watch out! They might have added a fearsome creature like the Sphinx to their army to give it some extra pop. One of the really cool things about this game is the victory point tiles. They may shift from one player to another at the end of a round. Just when you thought you needed only two points to win, now you suddenly need three!

Brilliant 3 player DOAM game which is a rare thing for me. Beautiful miniatures, excellent production values. 

As others may have commented, it's quick to play and rewards aggression (and not turtleing) with lots of avenues to victory. 

My only criticisms are a slightly deeper than normal learning curve for new players and craving for dice!
I recommend providing player aids/player power booklets if this is to be taught to new players.

Revised review: Everything is adjacent to everything so no real strategic options. It's just a numbers game. Card combat is a snooze fest. Reduced to 6

This is an area control game that feels very fast paced; unlike many war games with armies on a map, which tend to feature a phase of buildup during the first few rounds, you can and likely will have a major battle in the very first round.  This is due to the intentionally close-quarters nature of the map, as well as powers and teleporters which ensure that you and your opponents are always within striking distance of one another.  I like the Powers, basically a tech tree, and the combat cards work well.  This is just a great tactical combat game that plays well and fairly quickly.

Everyone is encouraged to go whacking someone else in this reasonably quick game of "Let's go whacking". And it does it reasonably well. Everything is within whacking distance. There's upgrades to improve your whacking abilities or to increase your income to buy more things with greater whacking. All in all it's a fun enough romp. Pick up some complementary abilities. Don't overextend yourself. Whack the leader and encourage others to do the same… even if you are the leader, because being whacked can be fun (and profitable) too. It's not bad. Simple enough to dive into after an extended break. Short enough that it doesn't outstay its welcome. Not very highbrow, but it's got nice bits and should be fun with the right group. So only whack the kids when playing Kemet - it's the only time whacking is cool.

I liked this a lot. More aggressive than I'm used to, but it worked. The combat has little nuance: x power vs x power with some modifiers and special cards (that you never seem to get and your opponents always seem to get).

After one play:

I think I prefer a game to have less frequent aggression but not because I dislike aggression in games. The battle mechanism was a lot of fun even though I sucked at it.

It was just so frequent end game that I could hardly follow all the interactions! I think the divine intervention cards are the final nail in the coffin of me being able to decipher how player A's going after player B affects players C and D...

I think it's one of those games where you just don't over-analyze, have fun, and accept that hindsight is 20/20!!!

RATING: 4
I love some of the ideas that went into this game, but what I'm increasingly realizing is that you should virtually never leave guys outside of your city. Taking over temples is a trap. That just invites someone to attack you, and if they win the combat, they get a point. My last game I made numerous attacks, but I virtually always recalled my guys afterwards. It just wasn't worth the possibility of getting attacked.

It's impossible to lock down a region and maintain control of it. This inability to maintain control of an area and the lack of strong defensive options really hurt this game, and the way that everyone can easily gang up on the leader makes the endgame way too gamey, king makery, and chaotic.

I like the tech tiles, and the way that the different factions differentiate themselves over time through the techs, but I think some of the bonuses are too similar.

Lots of tension in this one and first play was stressful as never felt like I was doing enough. Son had scarab and scorpion out and I had the snake, but in the end I chose my battles wisely and went for 2 temple control at the end of each day phase whenever feasible and pulled off a 9-3 win. Think I had 2 permanent temple VPs and maybe 3 battle ones. So many possible paths to victory in this game and with only one play I'm sure we barely scratched the surface.

RATING: 7
Whoa, the designers went ahead and addressed every single issue people have with a dudes-on-a-map game (DoaM)!

 - Playtime is short, only need 2 hours, tops
 - 1 action per player (instead of 1 massive turn per player) to keep players engaged and reduce downtime
 - Elimination of the 4-player adjacency problem by allowing for teleportation and dynamic military situations a la Rex and (to a lesser extent) Dune
 - Attacking is heavily incentivized (permanent victory points)
 - No bash-the-weak syndrome and no doggy-piling because of the novel 'Recall' idea, allowing you to melt your soldiers down for money and focus elsewhere instead of being a wounded duck inviting a doggy pile after a battle (damned if you win, damned if you lose). Virtually impossible to be ganged up on.
 - Nice benefit for the last-place player (rigging the turn order). I can see people sandbagging and trying to be last, then aiming for the ultimate push a la Power Grid and TI3.

Each of the Euro-mechanisms is thoughtfully integrated to smooth out the rough edges. Unlike Cyclades, which shoehorns an auction in for no good reason.

But is it any fun? Too early to say for me now. I do have a few quibbles:

 - Very conservative with the power level of techs and cards. Hopefully an expansion will unleash the nukes, similar to how Cyclades: Hades was a lethal adrenaline shot.
 - Don't quite like the same techs appearing every time, and having to come in with pre-thought out tech orders. I'm sure the first thing the expansion would do is add more tech options.
 - Some player asymmetry would be nice.
 - (Biggest issue) The 'map' in DoaM feels more like a grid. Very few areas and not too hard to make it so you can reach any space you want.
 - Component-wise, the board is way bigger than it needs to be (or the soldiers are way smaller than what they could be), which is nice for aesthetics, but makes the game take up a lot of unnecessary space since there's a lot of off-board components.

The good more than outweighs the bad right now. Especially the prospect of a satisfying DoaM game that supports up to 5 clocking in at under 2 hours.

[hr]

Lowered design to 4. 4 issues:
 - the board/grid issue is annoying - noted above
 - better to have a subset of techs instead of the same 48 techs every time (think Puerto Rico expansion) - noted above
 - the techs also need to scale with # of players. Weird with 3er and everybody getting a guaranteed VP + silver disc
 - feels more like a battle between prehistoric alien races when playing this instead of history/myth. Mythological creatures are par for the course but the teleportation is too much of a logical leap. Should have used an alien theme with stargates.

4+3

This is a solid, if unspectacular combat game.  I like the way the pyramids are implemented and the advances are pretty nicely done as well.  Combat is not as compelling as I would like and I felt that there was something lacking, though I did like the way the battle cards are used.  The monster sculpts are very well done and the sand wash coloring that they have is perfect.  The teleporting seems wonky as does the recall the soldiers for prayer points.  I also think that the multiple different types of victory point chits seems unnecessary and occasionally confusing.  Not bad and I'd play it again, but playing it lets me know that I don't need to own it.

FINALLY got a 4-player game in with the crew.  I have to say, while I like the fundamental nature of Kemet (in-your-face area control, vying for VP's, upgrades, etc.), I wasn't as impressed as I'd had hoped.  The "race to 8" seems cool except that it really enables hard-core leader bashing, and your group has to be OK with that kind of experience (my group is 100% ok with it).  The huge array of techs available right from the beginning is inelegant and overwhelming.  On the plus side, all of us felt there were some really cool tech-combos/strategies you could pursue in this game, once you became familiar with it.  

There's not much fun tactical movement-maneuvering going on (unless you have a monster that boosts your movement, and even then...).  Perhaps most damning, the combat is surprisingly dry.  The variety in battle cards is limited, and the "discard 1, use 1" mechanic seemed unnecessary to me (why not force players to use all 6 before getting them back?).  I just felt like we never got excited about resolving those cards.  TBH, I'd rather play Clockwork Wars...

One of my major recent disappointments. 

It's an euro-ameritrash hybrid all the way, or rather the game has two distinct halves. The ameritrash half is the best kind of DoaM (awarding attacking, map makes it easy to reach objectives). The eurogame half is my most hated type of euro - you have to put together an engine with few parts and limited actions (everything I hated in Endeavour). You just have to internalise this weird contraption of a tech three. Blargh. The problem with this hybrid is that previous well known hybrids were inspired by simplicity and streamlined euro approach, while this one embraces the solitarish puzzle aspect which recently dominates in euro sphere. Also why would combat cards be better than dice is a question only FFG knows the answer for.

Difference to Cyclades - Cylades' euro part (auction) is very interactive and should be played aggressively, Kemet's euro part is a puzzle against the game (okay, you can grab pieces before other players take them, whoop dee doo). Also people I played it with complained about king making - this rarely happens in Cyclades as there people watch over each other much closer and win conditions are simpler to keep a track off.  


Bottom line: I'll avoid this one and hope it doesn't have offspring. It also takes a very peculiar type of gamer: one who likes both attacking and optimising (what happened to my hobby?!). The group I played this with then moved to CitOW (whoo hoo!).

Óriási várakozással ültem le a játékhoz, mert nagyon felkapott és mindenhol dicsért játékról van szó. Ez egy full konfrontatív harci játék, ami gyakorlott játékosokkal tényleg rövid játékidejű lehet. Összesen 12 egységünk lehet, amivel Egyiptomban harcolunk egymással. Templomokat és egymás piramisait próbáljuk elfoglalni. Egy-egy csatáért a győztesnek jár győzelmi pont. A csatákat fix támadó lapokkal segítjük. Összehasonlítjuk a támadóerőt és kiszámoljuk a veszteségeket. Én magam részéről ezt még egyszerűbben oldottam volna meg, de nem rossz ez a része a játéknak. Számomra a legjobban tetsző dolog az akciók menedzselése. Egyrészt vannak imapontok, amik tulajdonképpen a pénzt jelentik a játékban, másrészt van alapesetben 5 akciónk egy körben. Ezt 7 fajta akcióra tudjuk elkölteni, amik közül van 2 egyforma is. Ezek egy piramisra vannak rajzolva 2-3-4 eloszlásban, amihez a szabály, hogy minden sorban kell egy akciót választanunk. Ez ötletes és jól működő dolog. Ezen túl még 3x16 lapka közül tudunk magunknak vásárolni, amik között van ugyan egyforma, de így is rengeteg lehetőséget adnak és különböző stratégiai utat a játékhoz. Ezek a lapok különböző dolgokban segíthetnek minket a játék során. Megszerzésükhöz pénzre van szükségünk, illetve megfelelő szintű és színű piramisra a főhadiszállásunkon. Eddig csak pozitívumot írtam a játékról, most jöjjenek a negatívumok. A kártyák, a lapkák, a saját tablók rettentő szépek, jól kidolgozottak, de valaki más csinálhatta a játék tábláját, mert az hihetetlen rondára sikerült valamiért. A győzelmi pontok sokféle jelölővel kerülnek kiosztásra, amik figyelése rettentő macerás. Felróható a Kemetnek a holtidő. Igaz, öten játszottunk, valószínűleg kevesebben már sokkal kevésbé lehet zavaró, de egy-egy lépésen lehet azért gondolkodni. A játék legnagyobb hibája azonban a királycsinálás. Szinte bele van kódolva a társasba ez. Kiesni nem lehet ugyan a játékból, de simán le lehet verni valakit annyira, hogy semmi esélye se legyen a játékban. Nem lehet benne olyan stratégiát kitalálni, amit két játékos ne tudna tönkretenni, ha ez a célja. Én úgy gondolom bárki is nyer meg egy Kemetet, ahhoz szüksége van arra, hogy ne figyeljenek rá vagy esetleg direkt ne üssék. Így a játék csak akkor fog jó játékélményt adni, ha ugyanolyan szintű és ezt megértő játékosok játsszák, más esetben biztos lesz olyan, aki rossz szájízzel áll föl a játéktól. Csalódás volt a Kemet, pontosabban egyértelműen nem az én játékom. A konfliktusos játékot kedvelőknek biztosan tetszeni fog, mert sok egyedi ötlet van benne és ha ki tudtak volna valamit találni a királycsinálásra, akár még jó játék is lehetett volna.

My only problem with the game is that the rule book was not the best (honestly) and I had to get a few questions answered on here to make sure im playing 100% correct. As a gamer, I feel like everything should be able to be played right out of the box. Its really sad that some people might be playing it wrong due to the ambiguity of the rules (such as on teleporting, some DI cards, losing on defense and getting to stay in the city, exex). If there was a better faq in the box, id give a 10

I really enjoy this game.

It's a light war game which gives you different paths to reach the victory; obviously, since it's a war game the attacking strategy is highly encouraged, but the great variety of tiles allows plenty of different strategies and synergies.

And the materials and the miniatures are amazing!

Unlike Cyclades, you actually get to use the cool monster sculpts, yea!

Like Cyclades, seems like it comes down to weird turn order/kingmaking issues in the late game. In newbie games, most games will probably be decided by players leaving weak armies around to pick off (attacking a weak army is the easiest way to get points, so it's important not to leave easy kills around). In experienced games I think it'll be turn order abuse.

The funnest part of this game is all in the tech combos and competing over assembling yours while other players are taking them. And that novelty wears off. The rest of the game can be a little boring. 

Also attacking is so beneficial that the game can seem to end up having a turtley feel, ironically -- you go after surefire or almost surefire wins and melt your dudes down for money, leaving as few attackable targets as possible until someone gets such a badass combo going that you have to stop them. Or you can make a surprise movement/breach and take someone unaware despite their turtling.

This game seems to be often compared to Chaos in the Old World and Cyclades for whatever reason. Not sure I think the comparison to CitOW is valid, but if we're doing that then my take is Chaos in the Old World > Cyclades > Kemet. But personally I'd sooner compare it to Clash of Cultures and Starcraft, and it loses there as well.

Played my first game tonight. Played with 5 people and it was everybody's first time playing it. It took about three hours including the explanation of the rules. We played with the 8 victory point rule but the winner ended with 10 victory points anyway.
 It's hard for me to compare it with other games because I'm still inexperienced with many boardgames but I liked the Fantasy-Egyptian theme along with the multiple things going on that really challenges the brain.

RATING: 9.5
Multiplayer war game where attacking is encouraged. Unlike other games of these types which usually involves lot of posturing and stalling, Kemet rewards aggressiveness from the 1st round onwards, with power tiles making the each player asymmetric as the game goes on. Only complaint, going last is too powerful on the last round, usually determines the winner.

EDIT: Leagues above all other similar games, Inis, Cry Havoc, Blood Rage, Nexus Ops are all a step down.

My first play I had some issues with the general layout of the board and the mechanics.  Maybe we played something wrong, but it seemed like you would build up your forces, take a shot at attacking, and then regroup and do it again.  Odd point disbursement.  Want to love it as I love Cyclades, but I didn't see any of the attraction of that game. *Update* - Well, I gave it another shot.  I want to love it and I do enjoy several parts of the game.  The three gods and their upgrades are a fantastic mechanic but what plays out in the field I do not enjoy.  It's something surrounding either the combat system (not a big fan of combat with cards) or the weird combat and movement present during the game.  Great miniatures and I love the company, but it appears that it is not for me.

If you want conflict, look no further. This game forces you to do battle with your opponents. I absolutely love the special creatures that get added to the board and the pyramids using d4 = super smart. My only recommendation for a reprint is to include player aids for all the tiles. We ended up having to take photos with our phones and then enlarging to have a reference guide. Sorely needed.

A really, really good multiplayer Euro-style wargame. I kind of think of it like Nexus Ops on crack - it's good to attack and is encouraged, but you won't cripple your opponents entirely when you do. Everyone is racing to get the various bonuses, and so many are of them are good in different ways: some make it easy to build an army, some make it easier to attack, and some just give you plain victory points. The other thing is that it's a race to 10 and basically you have to swoop in at just the right moment, seize the points that your opponents think are vulnerable to win. Fortune favors the bold in this one. Likely to go up with further plays, but too bad the only owner in the group is moving away. :(

RATING: 8
This game is amazing in so many ways but I don't think it has staying power.

First of all, the game is reasonably easy to teach and play and can be finished in about an hour.  For a game that accessible and reasonably paced the components are pretty outstanding.  Each army has a different color and design, the cardboard tiles are thick and sturdy, the art work is all pretty, and each of the mythical animals has a great looking plastic miniature.

The game is a reasonably light combat/area control game played very similarly to A Game of Thrones.  That being that combat is resolved by playing cards with different attack/casualty/protection values on them.  Attacking is the easiest, fastest, and most efficient way to make points but there are other very viable methods.  Control of certain temple areas can also gain you points, a special temple allows you to sacrifice units for points, and many of the higher level powers come with points.

Our first game ended with a pretty close spread, 10/10/9, and we all pursued pretty different strategies so they are all certainly viable.  I look forward to playing the game again to try different approaches.

That all said after one play I've seen most of what this game has to offer.  The map is pretty small, there are only 16 different powers available in 3 different colors and they're all visible/available from the start of the game, and the only other variable factor are these Divine Intervention cards that really just give basic combat and action bonuses.

I see the game getting very play-by-numbers after just a few plays which is disappointing for such a high quality game that also fits an accessible and timely game space.

After playing a game with a full compliment of players it is worth mentioning that the game feels very different.  There's a lot more competition for the powers.  With 3 players we tended to each focus on a different color and usually could get whatever we wanted first.  With 5 you will most likely have competition with others over a color you focus on.  There's also a lot more down time which can get a little bothersome.

This game is all about combat - starting fights is easy and rewarding. But it doesn't feel particularly mean, either - it's a European take on a typically American genre.

I got to play this and didn't like it when I really expected to love it. I do want to play again to make sure it wasn't just an oddity. But I have had the same feeling with the designers' other game, Cyclades.

The way the technology system works makes it to much of a race to specific powers. A player that doesn't get the power he was going for can be very hampered. Many of the powers are out of balance for their power level. This appears to have been designed this way to make the creatures more cool. If one player is going after a path that others are not, he will be at a huge advantage while the other players compete over the powers.

The combat system also didn't sit well with me. I love the similar system found in A Game of Thrones 2nd ed. The difference in aGoT is the combat cards are not the same for every player in combat, attrition and powers. With Kemet, the cards are identical for all players in the combat and attrition. Players will almost always play the best card for attack unless out numbered. If out numbered they will almost always play the best card for attrition. The variation in combat is done with randomly drawn cards that may or may not even be cards to use in combat. This system feels even more random and cheep than using dice. At least with dice you have some probability to go off of.

Dudes-on-a-map that deceives you! Not a traditional Ameritrash war game. More of a nasty Euro. The amazing components speak of lots of messy play, but it's really streamlined and surprisingly accessible and easy to play. Encourages interaction but doesn't permanently cripple losers. "Tech tree" in the form of power tiles allow you to customize your part in the game; but they do have a big learning curve and cause early downtime until familiar. Very fluid play and usually tight game among the leaders. Also plays surprisingly quick overall.

the first gaming feeling: just wow! (did know what to expect..now love it)

E: omg this piece is such a cool stuff! started with 2P, after some 3P game I LOVE it even more! cant wait to rock as 4P and 5P..!

E: dozen plays later, also in 5P.. KEMET is just amazing! such a trivial system and so much gaming within it! briliant conflict-based euro style almost-filler, self-ballanced and unforgiving.. must rise my rating again.!

(in 3P of experienced 11VPs quit is very okay!)

E: many games and thoughts later there's just nothing new left in there. for me. (similar feel to the DUNE, but came much sooner. i mean it's not bad but it plays out quite fast. also it creates no stories or memorables, but less fun like eg a complicated thus preffered CHitOW..

Lots of fun and definitely a very simple to explain yet fairly deep conflict game. My only complaints are that it seems like the red offensive tile track is simply better than the blue defensive tile track. Yes, the game is about war and fighting, but I figured there should be more balance amongst the tracks. Additionally, the white track has a lot of duplicate powers that overlap and aren't really needed as a focus path. I also question some of the combat mechanisms, as most battles seem to come down to very close numbers. Still, the game seems very fun and I can't wait to play it with 5 as our 4 player game devolved into a 2v2-type game.

The combination of critical use of resources both on the battlefield, in your city and in your hand of cards makes this one of my favourite games.

In games with experienced gamers the moves, counter-moves and their timing make a fantastic game.

RATING: 7.5
Good lightweight Wargame. Offers a 'customized strike team' experience.

Game has three main parts:
1 worker placement mechanic, however you are always guaranteed your actions and also have enough workers at your disposal. What this does is that the focus shifts more to a 'when' will you execute your actions as opposed to 'can' you take those actions, as in many euros. The only restricted area is the tile-taking and that means everyone is inclined to take such actions first, thereby telegraphing a lot of their tactics so you can react to this. This keeps each turn interesting as you have to pay attention to what others do.

2 The tile buying mechanic. This customizes your army and economic engine with unique capabilities only you possess in that game. As they are gradually bought, it allows everyone to keep track of their opponents power curve, both economic as combat strength wise. This is the hearth of the game, which explains its appeal to the non-Wargamer crowd.

3 Finally there's combat. Which is a simple affair of dropping your biggest stack where it needs to be, select a card from an ientical, limited and diminishing stack of modifier cards and resolve both asualties and outcome. Which are interestingly not coupled. You might win a battle while losing more figures. This, coupled with the short distance, the abundance of mobility and the cap on a maximum number of figures in an area (which is easily reached) makes warfare a non-strategic 'stack dropping' experience which focuses on quick point grabbing.

The last point reminiscences the way Dune works, which helps to keep the game tense. It is about grabbing victory, not grinding your way to victory.

All in all quite an interesting game, wonder if no dominant strategy will appear as there is not much hidden information in this game (as opposed to the classic Dune). 

Final huge benefit it brings: playable in one evening. Which often is a stretch for some other contenders in this genre (a game of thrones and chaos in the old world).

Disadvantage? You'll need minimum four but preferably five players for it to work. Not that interesting with 2 or three. 

Good fast light wargame, recommended.

I want to like Kemet, but every time it quickly turns into a slog where I have too many things to do and not enough actions. Since small tempo errors can easily cost the game, thinking time stretches out. The last move and kingmaker problems become more glaring as the number of players increases.

All in all, still a great game with lots of tension, but I'm anxious to see how the expansion will adjust the endgame balance.

RATING: 8
Initially, I thought this one was a masterpiece. It is actually quite good at getting players to pound on each other like vultures. However, with a few more plays, I'm having a hard time deciding if players' decisions actually matter at all. For semi-experienced players, all actions and all paths for success seem viable, to a point where it seems almost futile to plan strategies. The Divine Intervention cards that you add to combat which give you a +1 or +2 further aggravate the loss of player control and predictability. In other words, no matter how much you've calculated, your decision might not matter at all, in the end.

Much like Cyclades, this is a battle game with special powers. Unlike Cyclades, however, Kemet has a lot of special powers, and I mean a lot. Truth be told, the board's topology is almost a non-issue. With everything being so close together, and the ability to "teleport" to the handful of locations farther away, everyone can launch an attack against everyone. Your real choice is what cards to purchase, and how fast to purchase them. I'd almost rather play this game as a card game and be done with all the fancy plastic miniatures and huge board. They aren't doing very much work anyway.

The battle system is interesting, but ultimately a bit tedious. It reminds me of the combat system from Dune (now Rex), but less elegant. Or maybe a better comparison is Game of Thrones. The battle cards are a neat idea, but I can't help but think there's a better way to handle bluff.

It's a fine game for what it is, and if you're into special powers, combo-building, and tit-for-tat combat, you'll like Kemet. For me, I'll pass. Finally, it's worth mentioning that the game has big potential for king-making scenarios, so it's best to play at least a little fast and loose.

Much more straight forward than Cyclades, less random, more chaos, and a lot more attacking. Probably less strategic, but slightly more fun. Still amazing game :)

I'm not usually an area control fan, but Kemet is different enough for me to enjoy.  The tech tree is awesome and I appreciate how the emphasis is on attacking instead of defending areas.  I don't really have any complaints about the game.  I like the action selection, divine intervention cards, pyramids, and temples.  The game plays so fast, too.  This is on the short list of my favorite area control games now.

I have trouble with attacking; I even tend to sit on "attack"-style cards in Lords of Waterdeep, or play them only when they don't impact other players, or only attack the Lost Tribes in Small World - which frequently, and maybe unfortunately for my comfort level, doesn't tend to be a winning strategy.  I thought this game might help me get over that. 
To a certain extent, maybe it does.  I do rather like the game, - maybe it's the minis?  But I like the way it plays, even when it forces me to do things that are uncomfortable.  I have yet to find anyone to really play it with, though.

One of my two favorite clash games; very tight, stream-lined and yet very strategic rather than just tactical. I'm a sucker for a good combination of engine building and area control, I love the action selection and the pyramid mechanism, the game is full of suspension until the very end. Would rate this even higher if the production value was a little better.

RATING: 6.5
A beautiful game with beautiful components and with nice mechanisms. The game board is laid out in a very smart way. Despite all that this game didn't really take off in our group. It was better than Cyclades but unfortunately it didn't really click. It was somewhere between okay and good. I think the major reason it didn't really take off is that it tended to drag out in time with players having AP too often.

An excellent battling/area control game. Kemet encourages to start slamming other players in the face from the start. The battle card mechanic that is very similar to the one seen in Game of Thrones is a great touch, especially the aspect that forces you to discard one of your other battle cards every battle as well seriously limiting your options every second and third fight. My only critique is there are so. many. power tiles, and at first it can be hard to keep track of all of their abilities.

First playthough was with 3 new players. We didn't really utilize the powers, which is a major part of the game. We also turtled, which is easier to do with 3 players I feel like because there is only 2 moves per player. 

I will say I love what some of the powers did, and would love to utilize them. I also love how fast the turns are. The battle resolution is one of my favorites. I love how easy and fast it is, and that you dont lose all your troops.

It's really swingy, so you go from being on top to near the bottom and back again a lot.  The good point is that you still have a chance to win even if it doesn't look like it.  However, you never have that feeling that your going to win, so it can be a bit stressful.

RATING: 7.5
Very fun and relatively quick combat game that, much like Nexus Ops, uses scoring to encourage players to attack, attack, attack.  Unlike Nexus Ops, Kemet has very little luck, but it still feels nicely chaotic.

It's also a very easy game to learn (apart from the many upgrades that can be purchased).

I do think the geography doesn't really matter as much as it maybe should, especially after the players have had a chance to make various upgrades to troop movement.

RATING: 9
This game really hits a sweet spot for me and left an amazing first impression. It's a hybrid between conflict-driven game and Euro game with an emphasis on the conflict, because in the end the engine you're building aims at nothing else but optimizing the conflicts you are bound to have. And what's even more incredible is the fact that the game achieves to leave this fantastic impression even as a 3-player game. This is usually where any conflict-heavy game struggles. "Lurk but don't be the first one to attack or be attacked!": That's the golden rule in a 3-player game. If you happen to be the party lucky enough not to be involved in the first brawl, you'll be in an advantageous position. Here, the limited amount of troops and the possibility to recall the troops for both the attacker and defender make for situations with lots of back and forth with all three parties involved. Really excellent, extremely well balanced game!

RATING: 7
Not a bad game, and I like it much better than the often-compared Cyclades.

Initially I was excited for this game because it seemed like a meatier version of Nexus Ops, which is probably my favorite game in this genre. After playing Kemet, though, it feels more like Eclipse. This is due largely to the way the turns work. In Nexus Ops you move your whole army and take your whole turn at once. In Kemet and Eclipse, you take one action at a time. This results in making subtle moves and trying to anticipate what your opponents will do.

I'm giving this a 7 for now because the large number of power tiles are a lot to take in. I anticipate this rating going up after becoming more familiar with the game and the various tiles.

Sold.

I'm giving it an 8 right away for being a fairly streamlined conflict game. I want to own this some day and have it right next to Chaos in the Old World. I imagine this one would actually get more plays because it's easier to teach, plays quicker, and has a more presentable theme.

::UPDATE:: 

8/28/13 - Boy was I right. With only one more play, this game jumped up to my #2 spot in my collection. It's tense, it's interesting, it's tight, it's simple, it's, it's, it's everything a Euro fanatic wants in a conflict game. The way the system makes interesting decisions from the tech upgrades, and all the possible paths to victory is nothing short of brilliance. Attacking is balanced--not too swingy like dice can be. 

I'm going to write up a more proper assessment of why I love it so much, but for now suffice it to say that it does so much right that it has the potential to be one of my favorite games of all time. The only thing left to test it is to see whether or not it stands up to a lot of plays without starting to get dry or repetitive. 

Highly recommended. 

::UPDATE::

8/28/13 - Some comments I made elsewhere to sum up my feelings about Kemet:

Far and away, the most memorable and enjoyable game session I've had during the last 6 months came from a 5-player game of [b][thing=127023]Kemet[/thing][/b] this past Sunday night with one of my nieces and 3 of my nephews.

Such a fantastic, tense, and interesting game.

What I love about this game is how much fun you can have building up an attack engine (or not) and discovering your own way to build your VPs. There are so many possibilities in the strategic choices. It's just combo, and engine-building bliss. Kemet is by far my favorite hybrid. It's climbing way up in my rankings. It will definitely be top 5. I haven't decided exactly how high it will go, but I'm thinking possibly #3. And that's with only two plays under my belt. 

::UPDATE::

It is currently my #2 ranked game of all time with a 9.5 rating.

Knife fight in a phonebox is what the secret cabal podcast called this and they are right. It's straight up, in your face battle for advantage. Any choice you make is going to be at the cost of 2 or 3 other excellent options.

Interesting game that I'd definitely play again.  It's a game that would work better if players had familiarity with the technologies.  There is so much to take in out of the gate that the first few plays are a bit of information overload.  I remember the teleportation feeling a little wonky and out of place too.  And I think there is a lot of King Maker potential in the last round, which is always a very unfortunate.

First Impression:

Not my style of game. Although I like area control "grand strategy" games, the weird fantasy element (stargate or something similar) and the inability to actually defend strategically (everyone can attack everywhere) breaks this game for me.

I did like the components and most importantly the extremelly important and well thought "technologies", or godly powers. It's also luck free, which is another great plus.

I'd play this game again. It really does have some great elements, but it fails to create a spark in me.

Sweet Moses this game is fun! See what I did there? Moses... Kemet... Egypt... nevermind. What a bloodbath this game is. This game does a fantastic job of removing the turtling tendency from players, it really FORCES you to fight each other. All the time. Kemet has a really neat battle mechanic, using cards.  Not to mention all of the awesome upgrades you can buy for your civilization (you can buy a giant rideable scorpion for your army (!)). The best part about this game is how tense it is. No one is out of the race until the game ends. Every player feels like they had a legitimate shot at winning, all clawing for the victory at the same time. Brilliant.

The theme is what instantly sold me on this game. Ancient Egypt with gods and monsters thrown in the mix. The players all start as equals but that quickly changes even as fast as during the set-up of the game. Choosing which powers to go for and which abilities to invest in is one of the strategic decisions to this game. I was amazed to see that each different faction, representing a different Egyptian god, has a different look and theme. A minor detail that makes armies feel different.

The one downside is that the power tiles take up a LOT of space. I've solved this by using plastic sheets to store coins to store individual tiles. This makes it easier for all the players to look at the available tiles. 

No matter the player count, this is a good, thematic game. Sadly, Blood Rage has surpassed this game for me and my group, so I don't play it as often. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
[thing=127023][/thing] is a game of area control and conflict - high amounts of conflict - with an Egyptian theme. The players are Egyptian Gods (Bastet, Anubis, Ouadjet, Sobek and others) that uses their powers to be the biggest of them all.

The players are trying to have 8 (short game) or 10 (standard) victory points by the end of a given round in order to win. Points come from: winning a battle as the attacker, controling temples, making sacrifices at the Temple of All Gods, developing pyramids to their highest level, acquiring blessings, and so on. Some of these are temporary points (temples, pyramids), that others can take from you, others you won't lose (battles, sacrifices).

The game has some similarities with [thing=103343][/thing]: the way the game ends by points, how you can lose them if you lose a certain place or thing, and how the battles takes place: each troop is worth a point, then you must chose two battle cards from your hand, one do discard, one to use. The cards adds strenght to your troops, and can also cause damage and provide protection - the same things you can get with the House cards. Also, you only get the cards used/discard when you cycle your whole hand of cards. But I like that [thing=127023][/thing] has permanent points instead of a limit of time. With the permanent points the game is sure to reach a place where is impossible to prevent a win - the victory can change hands, but the game will end no matter who takes it. With only temporary points (as in [thing=103343][/thing]) you can be facing two or more players and go from 6 to 1 or 2 points. In [thing=127023][/thing] you can be beat in the same way, but you would go from 6, to say, 4 points. This is a huge difference in the "I'm still in the game" front.

[thing=127023][/thing] has some really nice components, especially the miniatures (even the armies are all different one from another, not only apart in color). The game is easy to teach and to play - most parts are intuitive enough (we understood the players boards without explanation, for instance). The manual is lacking more explanation about the use of the tiles and the FAQ for [thing=127023][/thing] is not really a little one (as I have been said, I don't actually see it) - but the game owner make sure to say that is paramount to read the FAQ before playing.

One play took about 100 minutes in the short game (8 victory points). I can't say I agree that the standard game will take only 90 minutes, but it is possible, I guess.

I liked the game well enough and I'm willing to play it again, given the opportunity (as I don't own the game). So, [thing=127023][/thing] is not only a pretty face.

It doesn't seem quite as entertaining as Inis and Cyclades after the first game, although it definitely has the potential to go up.

The basic rules are relatively simple but the manual is not quite as good as it needs to be and the plethora of tiles with their rules add a layer of complexity. Playing the beginner game as described in the manual is a good idea. Playing to 4 points (rather than the usual 8 or 10) gives a good introduction to the game and time for players to familiarise themselves with the main concepts of the game in a short game before getting stuck into a full game. A list of victory point conditions in a summary sheet together with copies of the tile descriptions for each player would have been very handy. 

Very keen to play more games and see how different tactics and strategies play out.

Way too much shit going on in this one.  Not in a rules overhead sort of way, in a "how do i proceed and not get wiped off the board" way.  Nutso flashy wargame.  Too many builds to choose from.  

I do admire how quickly it played.  Felt like an RTS. But I do not like an RTS.  This is accomplished by the victory points that can be lost and regained from controlling the temples.  Makes you feel like a free for all in the desert.

You're going to have to have a lot of knowledge about the builds to counter the other builds as they come out.

It does have a good feel.  Like everything is growing at lightning speed and dying even faster. 

If you want a flashy and quick abstract wargame with tons of bloodsheed and tactics this will be great for you.

I do not like an RTS.  I am not invested in learning builds simply to survive.  I have chess for that.

The art is FD (freaking delicious)

Kemet is a great tactical war game. It has a number of smart design decisions to balance the game. Teleportation allows for combat to occur quickly. Controlling temples rewards aggressive tactics. The tiles give powerful upgrades but cost resources to acquire. Looking forward to playing this game again to explore new tile combinations and different tactics.

A very enjoyable hybrid style game. So far it seems well balanced, with a possible minuscule disadvantage to the left side of the board with five players (because the game favors attacking and three players are on the right, near the closest temple, only two on the left). There are multiple paths to victory, but winning battles seems to play an important part in every game I have played to date. Power tiles are important but there are several paths to gaining an edge in battle (meaning that if one player takes the most desired tiles, there are useful alternatives). Good power tiles are harder to get the more players added...and it really sucks for the player who is trying to level up their pyramid to get something only to be beat out by an opponent and have to start over and take a new route to victory. Luckily, the variation on turns partly solves this dilemma (if one knows what they are doing)...however, be aware that it isn't always advantageous to go first, and it isn't necessarily a disadvantage to go last. Everything must be carefully weighed. A great game. So glad I added it to my collection.

I am no fan of Cyclades, and Kemet reminds me a little bit too much of that game. Yes, it is different enough mechanics-wise, but it provides the same tug-o-war feeling induced by players exchanging the same territories one turn after the other, holding back the leader until one of the others ultimately wins. The first few turns are better than the last, because you actually feel like you are building some sort of engine with the development tiles. Unfortunately, there are so many of them that you will need to print a quick summary of all of them and accept that new players will need a moment for themselves browsing them. No need to own this game, but would be willing to play again.

Very fun, and deeper than it looks at first. I'm unsure about the replay value, however.

Update - My fears were confirmed. It takes too long for what it is, lacks a sense of narrative, an endless back and forth with no progression, no sense of building. And so there's no real climax, just two hours of ganging up on the leader until someone sneaks in a win and the game ends in an exhausted "meh". Not sure how many plays this has left in it.

Update 2 - Jan 2014. My opinion of this game has improved; will expand later.

Kemet is an excellent game.

Although it's kind of the sequel to Cyclades, it uses a ton of different mechanics and really comes out to be a different game. To the point that nobody should be worried about getting both because they are both excellent and not the same.

On to Kemet. First off, Kemet has beautiful components. The miniatures, while most of them are small, are really cool looking. Each player gets a customized set of miniatures. There are also creature miniatures that you can recruit the help of and these are incredibly awesome. If only I had the artistic talent to paint them. The game uses a bit of the command and colors scheme (with attack cards) while also a bit of worker placement to take certain actions. Uses technology tree as well. I guess I could call this a very very light 4X game. It definitely encourages attacking and movement around the board. Most wargames are really slow to start, but Kemet gets right into the action.

So much to say here, but I need to play more to really start getting into the strategy aspects of it. 

Overall, Kemet is a fantastic game that wraps a bunch of heavy concepts into a nice tight package.

Lived up to everything I'd heard about it, really interesting, fun and quick gameplay with lots of interaction and plenty to think about.

It's really a fun system to have constant attacks and combat, but also a thoroughly enjoyable upgrade system built in where you're fine-tuning your gameplay as the game proceeds.

I love the reactive nature that Kemet provides over Blood Rage.  That race to snag tech's, that jockeying for position on the board and back and forth tug of war rather than constant clobbering.

If I could get more plays in I'm pretty sure it would go up to a 10 for me.

Egyptian themed game with little miniatures.  You build pyramids (red, white and blue) and get bonus powers.

There are also monuments you can transport to.

A bit bland. Constant fighting and diceless combat are a plus, but knowing which players have what tech is very difficult to track. I don't feel that the tech trees are balanced, but I think there are counters to strategies if enough people work together. It's a game with a high occurrence of kingmaking and turn order presents a lot of problems. It isn't broken but I haven't enjoyed playing it either.

Simple rules, beautiful components. I didn't really learn the symbolics yet and think it could have been done better. RftG does symbols right(how sick that might sound), Kemet could have learned a bit more from that.

Gamewise it looked at first like a game of Risk, but quickly it became clear that this has a lot more going on. I especially like the technology tree system that I wish to see in other games as well. Choices made have big impact on your game so winning feels like pure skill and no luck. Kingmaking is less of a problem than in other similar games. Playtime also feels like it hits the right spot. Epic feel is a downside as there is no feel of distance, all the temples are practically one teleport away which makes the game quite a tight and even struggle. Some technologies felt like they were way too powerful.
I guess my main problem is that I just don't like it, but still it's a high rating because there is so much good in the game. I guess my hating might be more about genre than the game itself.

So far for 3 out of 3 games, there is a point in the last round where someone gets to decide between 2 different winners.  It is not as fun knowing one person is getting to flat out decide who wins.  Also some of the powers a quite strong but only have 1 or 2 copies, so if you just happen to go 2nd or 3rd then you are in a weaker position.

Very good, potentially great with more plays.

Archetypical Eurotrash game. Action pyramid where each action can only be chosen once each round and actions must be balanced across the levels of the pyramid. Engine-building with special power tiles which give improved and new abilities. Non-random combat for resources and victory points. Lots of direct conflict, but resources and actions need to be managed carefully. Great components.

This is very much a Eurotrash game - and thus cursed. With a Euro front-end and an Ameritrash back-end there is something that most people will probably not like much or even dislike.

But for us broad-minded connoisseurs of fine gaming who appreciate the complex nuances of interwoven levels and styles of game play it is great.

A bit complex and slow for new players as you need/want to study the many different special power tiles, but not too bad - 2.5 hours for 5 first-timers including rules explanation.

ESSENTIAL: Print a copy of the Divine Intervention cards and Power Tiles index for all players - and lay out the power tiles on the table in the same order as on the index, so that it is easy to see which power tiles have already been taken and which are still available. This will probably reduce your playing time significantly.

While the two games are vaguely similar, Kemet does everything wrong that Cyclades does right. Cyclades has an interesting auction that really is the heart of the game, while in Kemet they decided to keep the action selection simple and make combat much more complicated with several decks of cards and oodles of special power tiles. The result is jarring: a game that is massively more complex yet for my tastes less interesting as there is little subtlety to the combat system, just +x modifiers left and right for your hit points, defense points, wound points, etc... you get the idea.

The auction in Cyclades was a focal point of interaction; Kemet with its smorgasbord of special powers is much more self-absorbed and consequently much less interactive (constantly we were forgetting whose turn it was, which would never happen in Cyclades). Fans of multi-player conflict games with shiny components and lots of chrome that don't mind shallow game play will be perfectly at home here. I would rather play a myriad of other multi-player conflict games that aren't as overwrought and actually have interesting decision-spaces.

Super fun light game about conflict. Light but only for those who can wrap their heads around all power tiles and love making combos. If you can't do this, you will lose.

Edit: 8->6 some tiles are super strong and some are useless. This makes the game less replayable than I thought. And, this game is prone to kingmaking if one or two players can't maximize their planning. Question is, do I want to look for skilled players to play such a light game?

RATING: 7
Wow. What a gorgeous game. Everything from the map to the ink washed miniatures just drips with its mythical Egyptian theme.

The game itself is slightly one dimensional, but it works within that confined space very, very well. There's no engine to build, no objective to be had, other than attacking for the sake of attacking. You can't even really expand your empire, because there are so few available troops. Holding land is pointless anyway, because it's just empty space. The game's only currency is faith, which is generated off board. The entirety of the experience is taking turns punching each other in the face, until the allotted number of punches are landed.

That sounds terrible. Yet my plays so far have been very enjoyable. There are a number of paths through the troop upgrades and the mythical monsters you can recruit keep combat interesting. Also, the card based combat system injects an almost perfect amount of player control, while still generating a fairly wide spread of results.

If you need a narrative arc, this game is not for you. If you want to admire the mighty empire you've built up from a tiny city-state at the end of the game, this one is not for you. This is a pure tactics game that rewards reactionary game play to a fault. If you can get around the lack of a storyline motivation for the fighting and look past the complete non-existance of an actual goal, you'll find a very enjoyable game.

I wasn't really feeling this one. I think it was because while I knew that you had to be aggressive (the main comparison between this and Cyclades), I didn't realize just how all-out vicious you should be. I played it somewhat safe, and ended up not getting very far.

I'm willing to give this one another try, and I'll test out a "salt the earth" strategy.

It's a good game with beautiful components. I love the "tech tree" and the way you gain new abilities throughout the game. But..

...I don't like the teleportation system and the fact that only the attacker gains points from won battles (with the exception of the player owning a certain blue tile) - this feels very unnatural to me. I prefer games with more strategic movement on the map, which allow for both defensive and offensive play.

Still, if you like battles and miniatures - this one is definitely for you.

In my younger and more innocent years, I used to play a fair bit of Risk. I like Risk...or rather, I like the idea behind Risk: march your armies across the board and crush your enemies beneath your heel.

As I got a little older and became more self-aware, I realized that while I enjoy this concept, Risk itself took too long to deliver and often boiled down to a few simple strategies. And it could easily leave some players sitting on their thumbs for an afternoon.

Kemet is a game that feels like the designer said: "You know what would make Risk fun? If it only took 2 hours, you could upgrade your army and you were encouraged attack, attack, attack!" That's what this game delivers.

Where Chaos in the Old World is a game where each player begins entrenched in their play style, Kemet starts everyone on even footing and then lets each player dictate their own play style as the game progresses. Wanna go for red cards, white cards or blue cards? What about a mix of all? Want better combat cards, or special troops?

It's a very clever spin on the dudes-on-a-map formula and is enhanced by some pretty delightful components. The "Mythological-Egypt" theme is pretty sweet, too. It may not quite be my favorite replacement for a Risk-like experience (just wait for it...) but, as it is, it's a great game.

Half a point for the wonderful material and nice art in the cards and tiles.
About the game: there's not much original mechanics and the game flow is fast but somehow anticlimatic. In a 3 players game 2 of us probably interpreted the game in the wrong way and started "building up" our strenghts while the 3rd just won a couple of victories and secured a lot of the 8 needed points. The game ended pretty soon and i was left with the feeling of "what is all this material about?". There are a lot of things but the game is just resolved by going out there and kicking some ass with the old mechanic of number of troops plus number from your card.
Quite disappointing but I could be convinced to play it again just to see if something change

I like games with lots of aggression and Kemet has it in spades. In addition, it allows players to build their army (or civilization?) in a way that suits them or in a way that's interesting and exciting. It also does a fantastic job of combining area control, dudes on a map, and worker placement (in the actions you get to take). I'd definitely like to get this to the table some more.

Area control and confrontation with miniature armies in Ancient Egypt.  Spend prayer tokens to buy white, red, and blue upgrades or increase the level of each color's pyramid. Identical player combat decks are played to modify combat. A big decision for players is when to use or save their big combat cards.  What shines in this game is the anti-turtling measures employed by dividing territories in a way that allows for fast travel, by allowing forces to attack any region with obelisks, and with player pyramid action boards that limit action choices which nudges players into conflict.  A big part of the game is learning how the technology upgrade tiles work and how to use them most effectively.

I can't in good conscience give a brand new game, that i only played once, a perfect 10. But i am going to toe that line with a 9.5! This game is thrilling, agonizing, visually stunning, instinctive, carnal, crisp and consice, etc. I could go on. 
If you enjoy confrontational games, this is your game. If you enjoy agonizing over multiple great tactical/strategic choices, this is your game. If you enjoy games with high quality figures and beautiful art, this is definetly your game. The one draw back to this game is the rules explination time. There is alot going on and new players will be overwhelmed by the available option right off the bat. Lots of icons to digest.
Just as a base line, my top choice games are St. Petersburg, Power Grid, Agricola and LOTR: The card game.
So you can see that i love a good euro. This game fills that "wanna crush my opponent to a pulp" void that most euros just cant satisfy. BTW, one cannot be completely eliminated. You can simply resurrect any number of troops on your next turn for a cost in 'prayer' points. Brilliant! Oh and, once you control a creature, it is yours for the rest of the game, which will grant your unit special abilities. The creature figures completely stole the show. Fantastic production quality with some kind of glaze that excentuates the details of the figures. Jaw dropping! Also, the game uses three colors of 4 sided dice as pyramids which corrispond to three different class of upgrades. Each time you level up your blue pyrimid, you then have access to a new class of upgrades for that corrisponding color.
Anywayz, ranting. 'love the game. gonna buy ASAP (Feb?). 

P.S. Thanks Eric for introducing us to this game! Great job with the rule explination. Trust me, i know it as difficult to teach a new game as it is to learn one. And thanks to Pheonix Games in Mukilteo, WA. I just discovered this little game shop a few weeks ago. Great atmosphere, great selection, great people!

I have wanted to play this game for ages and now I finally have I'm not disappointed with it.
It's a simple case of do or die and I love how it's isn't convoluted and there's no messing: it's just down to action.
There's plenty of strategy but it's difficult to get anywhere if you are playing someone who has an idea what they are doing and you don't (it will feel lame) but once you know all the tiles you can buy and what they do you should pick up nicely.
LOADS of take that so if you don't like that then I don't see this game going down well.

RATING: 5
The colorful, stylish font on the cover is my favorite part of the game.  It doesn't even matter that it's unreadable.

Our session dragged at the start because everyone focused on tech-ing up their units, which admittedly is the right thing to do. If everyone jumps into combat without upgrades, battle becomes an uninteresting exercise between closely-matched military groups.

The monster sculpts and powers are fun, especially when they're on your side, but that's not a good reason to purchase or play the game. [i]Kemet[/i] also suffers from the two most common multiplayer deficiencies: leader-bashing and hammering of the weak (i.e., the recently attacked).  In this case, the deficiencies are compounded by free-for-all board teleportation.

I'd also wager that some upgrade tiles are significantly better than others.  Since all upgrades are available each game, the tiles that are purchased by players early in turn order may become scripted.

In short, [i]Kemet[/i] is another light multiplayer combat game that isn't better than [i]Nexus Ops[/i].

One the best area control games I've ever played. Drafting power tiles,  trying to build some sort of economy that works all while combat takes place every round with zero luck. Add on top the ability to get giant mythological monsters and you're in for a fantastic time.

Wow, this is now the most gorgeous game I own.  [hah, that was a while ago..  still a looker though]

Play is very streamlined.  Combat is highly incentivized which is awesome.  It doesnt feel painful or punitive when you lose a battle, which is interesting.  Hopefully the conflict shy can learn to appreciate the game and the necessity to battle given the high incentives and low cost to commit.

That said, this is a really cool euro war game with a really interesting take on civ building.  I think the game will be even more interesting and fun as we learn more about the tech trees and strategies.

finally got to play with 5.

This is my favorite 'area control' game.  so much conflict, and so much fun.

Beautiful game, that at first glance represents a lot I don't like: wargamelike, dudes on a map, miniatures.. 
But the designers made some great choices: you gain points by attacking & winning, but you don't lose points when you lose. You can easily teleport all over the board. 
The large collection of special power tiles is something I really appreciate. 
So overal, a great game in a genre that is not my cup of tea.

Cool area control game that I feel would really shine with more plays so you begin to understand the tiles a bit better.  The monsters from the tiles are just pure awesome.  The pyramids are a nice, heavy weight, the board is big enough so the minis all fit comfortably.

Love this game! Probably more wargame than Euro but I enjoy the god powers and the mythical creature models. Happy to play any time. Not the easiest to get into for new players though because of the learning curve to grok the best powers and combos between them. Play can be slowed by pages of power descriptions being passed backwards and forwards until they are learned.

Game mechanics do not get with theme at all. Gameplay is rather bland and repetitive. Having to refer to a guide for 48 power cards also slows things down.

One of the best fantasy area control/skirmish game in the market. Extremely balanced map to ensure nobody have a disadvantaged start, incredible depth from tech upgrades, interesting table-meta due to the first player token mechanic, and the best of all:

Players are put into action as quickly as the first round! There's no build up, there's only excitement.

OK so first off, only play this so you get access to the full board (4 or 5 players) otherwise it just gets very weird. I like the gameplay, I like how the game rewards agressive strategies. Monsters are cool, although a bit too powerful bearing in mind the fact they are unkillable. The cards are a big minus for me. Too cryptic. You need to print a reference sheet for every player in order to keep the game flowing. Just a "different" game. I need time between sessions of Kemet, but that's certainly a game I would want to play again.

RATING: 7
Great production quality as one would expect from the publisher is a great draw to Kemet... but the advancement/building/combat game in the box would be a ton of fun with wooden cubes for dudes and a flimsy deck of cards for tiles... though print out the player aids if you hate passing one tiny book around the table constantly.

The advancements are fun and give you neat abilities... the action and resource starvation is just right to make it thinky without constantly making your plans impossible... and the aggression is so tied to gaining points that you can hardly get angry with folks for "picking on you" if you leave yourself in a vulnerable position.  Lots of fun here if you like Euro mechanics and area control tied to blind bidding combat.

This game is absolutely a blast. It may drop in the future, but I have had so much fun playing so far. 

It is quick, seems simple, but actually packs a ton of options and has some great strategy. Pick up this game..you will not regret it.

This is most definitely medium weight. There are lots of options to buy in this game, which can be daunting for new players. Once you understand the iconography, however, this is a beautiful game of balance. 
I don't often think to long about strategy. I go with gut feeling. This provides me with simple enough choices to plan out a simple plan without taxing the brain too much. 
Because the game rewards you only for attacking, it speeds along at a healthy pace, and doesn't overstay its welcome.

Right now, make the rating a 7 for 2p and an 8.5 for any other player number.  In a strange twist, odd player numbers (3/5) are also seemingly better than even player numbers (2/4) because of the added strategy with the sacrifice temple.  (See the game's forums for an explanation of this odd design decision.)

I like it, but I'm not sure how much staying power it will have.  Definitely interesting and, in my opinion, superior to Cyclades which would serve as its main competition.

A good game that looks gorgeous. Top quality as usual with this company. Actual gameplay is done very well. No dice or luckfest for this light wargame. In fact the only luck comes from a deck of cards that every player gets one card of each turn. But these cards themselves are balanced. Battle is done like in Agot and is rewarded/encouraged with vp. It’s an aggressive game that punishes turtling. It includes some good ideas, retreating lets you take back your soldiers to the pool for power instead of them being chased for easy vp by others.  Moving your armies around commanded by huge monsters is fun and imaginative. All technologies are available from the start and open the way for many different routes. The tech tiles seem to be balanced very well. 

Minor nitpick: they should have included more overviews of all techs for every player.

This area control war game is superbly designed. The fact that everyone starts equidistant is amazing and I love the emphasis on aggression. I am simply blown away by the sculpts of the models, being different for each player color, and the power tiles that allow you to customize your faction every game are super fun. I even love the card driven combat, although others do not share those feels. Overall, this is a richly thematic, beautiful, and strategic war game of mythological proportions.

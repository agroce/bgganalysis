This is quite a bit more cut-throat than it seems on the surface.  It has a lot of "take that", but it's still a light fun game (with little plastic kitty figures in different poses).

Light weight, with quite a bit of luck in the card draw. As a time filler it's fine but I'd rather play a lot of other things.

A very good filler game. Fast, fun, with just enough tactical play and card combos to save it from being another random card game. I don't think I ever had a useless hand and the 'take that!' interaction wasn't too vicious. This avoids many pitfalls of other fillers and I enjoyed it throughout.

Edit: 6 player game is ok, but not as good as 3-5 player. 2 cards as a hand is too restrictive.

It's a game about collecting cats and it delivers that exact experience. The art on the cards is super cute and quite punny. You get attached to the minis you pick and it can get personal when someone steals your favorite. I really like that all the cards are relevant to the theme and the names and functions make sense together. I also love that the cards that represent responsible pet ownership (spay/neuter, microchip, low cost vaccine, etc.) actually give you a decent bonus in the # of cats you get or keep. I've played it with both kids and adults and everyone had a good time.

This game does have some curb appeal just because of the plastic kitties. However, playing it was not very exciting, with some very not fun cards. I think it could be made into something pretty special as I did like the further in the cats were the more they were worth.

This was a gift.  Although it is relatively simple, the theme is very cute and it plays well.  Definitely NOT for serious gamers but great to include friends and relatives who are not regular board gamers.

RATING: 7
A rather simple game, where you are trying to collect cats to live in your house or porch or even the yard. Each turn you get to actions which move a cat or play a card for the effect. You get different bonuses by collecting the most of one of the 4 types and one of each type. Yes there is a lot of luck in the card draw. However, there are just enough combos and take that in the cards to keep it interesting. 
The cat meeples were cut, and my daughter in law appreciated the gift.. 
It makes a good family game.

A fast little game that always generates some giggles.  Has some "take that" strategy that isn't always as cute as the game's kittens, however there are defense cards that can insulate from the"take that" strategy.

The neighbourhood has a lot of stray cats.  Your goal is to score points by trying to get as many of them into your house, porch and yard.  Each turn, you use your two actions to move a cat, play a card or discard cards (so you can draw new/better ones at the end of your turn).  Scoring is based on the number of cats in a certain area on your property as well as the colours of the cats.

This game makes me feel like that crazy cat hoarder you hear about.  I like cats, so this game is great to me.  The cards you play allow you to move more cats onto your property or steel cats from someone else.  There are also defensive cards to protect your cats.

This is one of my family's favorite games. If anyone says there's no strategy or too much luck you can safely ignore them and maybe even assume they haven't played it. Is there luck? Some, in card draws, just like in over 90% of games. Is there little strategy? This one is crazy - the game has loads of strategy BUT your strategy can be sabotaged by other players, which of course is a strategy. This is a take that game. If you don't like that then you probably won't like this though the "take that" aspect is light. Great game, great minis, great art. My only complaint is that the cards are a little too thin.

You may as well just assign cards arbitrary numbers and flip them over, and if you have drawn the highest total, you win. This is barely a game, it's terrible. Complete waste of paper and cardboard.

Played a couple of games and it seemed to be over quite quickly and each round is very cut and dry, you either did best or you didn't. I kind of liked it but I won;t ever offer it as a game above another card game especially since there are lots of card interactions to learn if i'm teaching it, it's not worth the investment for me.

I think I prefer climbing games like Tichu where you keep a score and some rounds you might win 60-40 but some you might win 300 to -100 and I prefer that sort of differential in the scoring to balance it out over a whole game.

It is a tick taking game. But it is really chaotic, every card have an effect and it is very difficult to take the better of it, trick taking games are already difficult to play right, with this so much chaos it is nearly impossible, I didn't enjoy this game.

RATING: 8
Quite a novel trick taker.  Four suits, one wild. Following suit is obligatory, although a wild card can be played at any time.  Highest card of the suit led usually wins the trick. Every card has a special power that always takes effect when it is played.  These powers are clearly described in text at the bottom of the card (plus a more cryptic icon).  The point scoring objective changes each hand.  An added twist is the four evil cards that you mostly don't want to collect.

I was initially nervous of the special powers, fearing that (a) they would slow the game down and (b) that they would bring too much chaos.  My group quickly grasped the powers - there aren't so many, just 10 repeated three times in the conventional suits and six wild card powers.  They do add a degree of chaos, but it is possible to plan for them.

I found Chronicle quite a novel twist on good old trick taking.  The changing point scoring conditions add a healthy degree variation, making you approach each hand and particular cards quite differently.  I'm having a lot of fun with it.

Chronicle's artwork is, well, distinctive.  Card quality in the Z-Man edition is excellent.

A much more interesting version of Hearts or Spades.  I like the variety of goals to achieve, and how the wild cards break the rules (and how plentiful they are).  A little bit of "take that!" can ruin player's clever plans, but can make Chronicle slightly chaotic, maybe more than some people would enjoy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
I love trick-taking games but this one did absolutely nothing for me. It is needlessly overcomplicated and the concept of tricks that stop half way through, of being able to steal cards that other people have won, 'evil' cards that stop you winning and a different objective for each hand might all work well as separate mechanics, but put together like this they just create a mess. Yuk.

RATING: 8
To quell the "OMG, all the cards have effects on them" issues, in my 2 games, (7-8 hands) Ive been able to form some sort of plan with my hands of cards, and see them through (or sometimes, almost through). This game is pretty finely balanced. To be honest, the first few hands are tough, as you have a hard time remembering the effects of the cards, but a few hands in, it feels fine. Pretty innovative, and I really like the art and theme.

RATING: 6

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Chronicle is a trick taking game with a surprising amount of depth, thanks to the changing objectives provided by the history cards. It's also a game that cuts a careful balance between committing early (and putting yourself at risk of other people's attack cards) or holding back (and hoping that the round doesn't end too soon). Since every card has both a strength value and an ability, and since there are some tricks that you really don't want to win, it is rarely an automated choice about what card to play. That makes it a hard game to introduce to new gamers, but one which veterans will take to immediately.

As is the norm in this genre, it takes a few rounds to get used to the different abilities of the cards. But once you do, this is a quite nice trick taking game. What I liked the most is that every round there is a different goal, which in turn can change the value of some cards. For instance, it can transform a very valuable card into a hindrance, forcing you to reassess your whole strategy for the round. I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes this type of games. Beatiful artwork too.

RATING: 3
First play was confusing: tricks are easy to take but different action in every card makes it much harder. We played with three and game took much too long.

Second play with five and game was much faster. But it still wasn't too fun. There are some killer cards which guarantee that you'll not lose. There's just too much in it that game would be predictable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Surprisingly complex for what seems at first to be a simple game. This is NOT a kids' game or family game unless the family members are all 12 and over and WELL VERSED  in the trick-taking genre. It takes something like Hearts and gives you a LOT more to think about due to all the special powers and the way you want to manipulate your allies before the end of the round. Not for the faint of heart.

I'm disappointed because given it's from Senji Kenai I assumed it would be lighter-weight like Love Letter or Cheaty Mages. Unfortunately, there's little chance I'll be able to play this with the kids any time soon. I'll probably hold onto it though, because I think it's a very unique game and one I'd love to get to know better some day.

RATING: 6
A neat and fairly chaotic spin on trick taking, where every card played triggers a special effect when played, such as taking a card from tricks that another player has already won, making players discard cards, taking one of the cards from tricks you've won back into your hand, etc.

It's also neat in that each round, an "event" is flipped which dictates the winning conditions for the round.  Some times you'll want to win the most of a suit, other times you'll want to just win the most cards, etc.  To further add to the scoring, you always want to avoid taking 4 "evil" cards, or somehow get them out of your pool of cards you've won, or else you're ineligible to win a round.

Overall, it was fun, but chaotic, but I think the chaos also wears off once everyone is familiar with the cards and what they can potentially do.  Overall, a unique trick taker with some neat twists.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's a trick taking game which never ever grab me but this has some interesting mechanics of getting an ability when you play a card and cards left in your hand are added to your display of cards won called allies. It is a nice twist but also feels a little too chaotic and your good plays can just be negated by a different card effect played later so I would play other trick taking games over this one. 2 Plays.

All the variety and fun chaos of Cosmic Eidex without the esoteric scoring system and rules-referencing to remember what the hell your power does. Neat!

Played once the "advanced" way where you have 2+ goals and was NOT a fan. There's so few history cards that it's very likely to have two opposite cards which just makes the game easier. Also, it's just more tense and exciting when you're all going after the same goal. I feel like the variant should be Was Sticht? style - everyone gets their own goal.

It's hard to tell how much control you actually have in this game. You certainly feel like there's a lot as you  have to always think about how best to use your cards (both in terms of their power AND value) and what other people still have left. Repeated plays will tell if it's just complete luck and chaos, and right now I'm happy to keep playing to find out!

A MUST for trick taking fans. I mean c'mon, it's like, 7 bucks!

Players are attempting to the be first to claim three fame points.  Straightforward, if rather chaotic, trick taking game.  Cards are in three suits, from 1 to 10 in each suit, along with six wild cards.  All cards are dealt out, and standard trick play follows (must follow suit, or play wild, otherwise discard off suit cards).  Each suited or wild card played to the trick also has a special ability, such as take a won card back in hand, or discard won cards from the game, meaning the cards are in a high state of flux as they roam around the table.  The object of the game is to achieve the goal of the hand, which varies from hand to hand, to earn the fame point. However, if you have claimed any cards that are evil (the 1's of each suit, or the Demon wild card), then you cannot earn fame - unless you shoot the moon and thus claim two fame! This was initially quite confusing as you knuckle out what the cards do, but swiftly becomes a fun game full of nasty little surprises as you master the card combinations.  Nice little game.

With all the best elements of Fluxx, Uno, Hearts, and Spades (and none of the negatives), Chronicle is a fantastic light card game with outstanding graphic design and strategic game play. The History cards vary the winning conditions and make a game of this play uniquely from hand to hand. An overlooked winner!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Chronicle is an odd trick-taking card game.  The game has 3 suits with cards from 1 to 10.  In addition, there are 6 unique cards.  All cards of the same number share the same special ability regardless of suit and each of the unique cards have no suit but have a unique special ability.  So that's 16 unique abilities that can be triggered when a card is played during a trick.  Cards that you win during a trick enter your tableau and when the round ends (one player has no cards in hand) some players will get victory points for meeting the conditions of a random event based on what's in each players tableau.  A new event is drawn each round so the winning conditions change.  When someone achieves 3 VP the game is over and that/those players win.  So far it seems decent but probably too chaotic.

Variable goals make this game much more interesting than most trick-taking games - each round requires a different mindset, and the cards' powers mean that tactics vary too.  And the artwork is very striking.

Chronicle is a neat trick-taking game with special powers. The first play is a little slow as people get to digest the different card powers and might feel a little random due to them not being used efficiently but as players get acquainted with the game things should get a little more interesting.

Is there anything that sets Chronicle apart from other trick-taking games? Quite possibly. The card powers do add a lot of chaos but the game still doesn't feel totally out of control, and it's certainly not one of those trick-takers where your hand plays itself on autopilot.

An interesting trick-taking card game with a lot of special powers occurring with almost every card played. It reminded me a little bit of Dragonmaster, with the beautiful (but sometimes obfuscating) artwork and the variable point scoring. However, they are very different games. I liked this one, but I think I prefer card games that have a little less going on.

This game makes a nice variable trick-taking game, with a loose outer theme around a mechanism to vary the point earning rules each hand.

There are 4 suits, and most cards have some value towards earning points, while some block you from doing so.

The theme is around the history of an imaginary fantasy kingdom, and the various people inhabiting that kingdom- the people make up the deck of character cards that form hands, the 12 historic events set the rules to earn points at the end of each hand.

It seems like a nice enough little game (though chaotic), and it may grab me more with additional plays, but I'll start this at a 6.5

Crónicas es un juego de bazas algo raruno. Las cartas pertenecen a uno de entre tres palos (Amor- Sabiduría y Poder). Además, hay 6 cartas únicas llamadas "comodines". Todas las cartas de un palo tienen un número de 1 a 10 y las cartas del mismo número comparten un poder especial con independencia del palo al que pertenecen. Además los 6 comodines también tienen habilidades exclusivas que se ejecutan cuando se juega determinada carta durante una baza.

 Durante tu turno es obligatorio que juegues la carta del palo que "pinta", pero no es necesario que superes el valor de la carta mostrada por el contrincante. Si no tuvieras carta del mismo palo, puedes jugar un comodín o jugar una carta de cualquier palo, pero boca abajo para que no se active su poder.

Las cartas que consigues ganando una baza pasan a formar parte de tu despliegue personal (=se convierten en tus aliados) y cuando termina una ronda (= un jugador se queda sin cartas), algunos jugadores sumarán PV´s por cumplir las condiciones que marca una carta de crónica para esa ronda ("el que más cartas verdes tenga como aliados", "el que menos cartas rojas tenga como aliados"...). Se saca una carta de crónica en cada ronda, así que las condiciones de victoria cambian cada vez. Cuando alguien alcance 3 PV´s, gana la partida. Es un juego muy decente, pero algo caótico. PROS: en los juegos de cartas dependes en exclusiva de tu suerte y tu saber hacer para llevarte alguna baza, pero en este tienes posibilidad de "inventar" algo nuevo gracias a los superpoderes de cada carta, que se activan al jugarla. CONS: Quizá demasiado caos para los que les gustan los juegos verdaderos de bazas. Cuesta entender todos los superpoderes de las cartas durante las 4-5 primeras partidas, así que hay que tener paciencia si se juega con muggles.

[ENG]

Chronicle is an odd trick-taking card game. The game has 3 suits with cards from 1 to 10. In addition, there are 6 unique cards. All cards of the same number share the same special ability regardless of suit and each of the unique cards have no suit but have a unique special ability. So that's 16 unique abilities that can be triggered when a card is played during a trick. Cards that you win during a trick enter your tableau and when the round ends (one player has no cards in hand) some players will get victory points for meeting the conditions of a random event based on what's in each players tableau. A new event is drawn each round so the winning conditions change. When someone achieves 3 VP the game is over and that/those players win. So far it seems decent but probably too chaotic.

RATING: 7.7
A trick taking game where the rules are set by a card each round(aka The Dwarf King). Each playing card within the four suits along with wild cards has its own special ability which is activated when played face up creating a certain level of chaos in the game. Good card graphics and strategy makes this an entertaining trick-taker.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Own it and read the rules, sounds good and up my alley but there might be a little unwanted (in my case) chaos (though I think some can be mitigated). I can deal with chaos, on occasion, in the right kind of game with suitable length like usually a party style game. 

Here the length is very short so suitable, but its a "trick taker"! Hey, what's the big idea putting chaos into a trick game, have not seen that before and I have played a LOT of trick takers and love them! Well, will just have to play it and see what I think and if I can adjust to this new way of trick-taking, or if chaos is just better off in something like Love Letter...

Each round has a different goal and each
meeting (trick) within a round depends on
powers of the different cards played.

Nice trick taking game in which the win conditions for each round vary (first to take three rounds wins, essentially) and each card has a special effect when played.

Knowledge of the cards is required for competent play against experienced opponents (not that they're hard to fathom).

I like the Japanese art. Apparently the American publisher renamed 'The Prostitute' card in the original Japanese deck to 'The Mother' - cultural differences!

This is an initial impression after one play, but I really enjoyed Seiji Kanai's take on a trick taking game. The different card abilities are not unlike Love Letter, where sometimes the abilities are useful and sometimes you really don't want to play them. The history deck is a really cool idea, too, which gives each round its own feel and goal. You may be trying to collect very specific cards one round, then avoid collecting cards the next round, and then try to collect all cards the next round. Great little game, definitely worth checking out.

5-14-2015 Update: I still really enjoy this game, and everything I said above still applies, but it doesn't make it to the table very often. There are too many other games to compete with it. So, I'm dropping my rating to a 7.

RATING: 7
Chaotic but clever trick-taking game from the author of Love Letter. There's some familiarity in style but Chronicle is a gamers' game. To shine it needs players familiar with the card effects. This means not just discarding evil cards but actively placing them with opponents when they can't react anymore. Depending on the victory condition, gameplay can change noticeably, some hands just can't be won and some decisions while executing card effects are irrelevant. It's short enough that this doesn't matter.

Definitely a unique game. I enjoy trick-taking games and this one is fresh enough to warrant further exploration. My only reservation is with the play time. It didn't grab all of the players the first time through and that will make it difficult to get back to the table. This seems like it would really shine with experienced players, since the play time would go down.

RATING: 7
Relatively quick. I'm normally horrible at trick taking games, but did fairly well at this one.  I think the key though is that it's much more about hand management and seeing a good time to play a card rather than the usual need in trick taking games of knowing the order of cards you want to play in your hand and when to seize the lead.

Interesting trick-taking game with interlocking powers that slow it down a bit. People looked at me funny when I said that this game was going to put my AP in full gear ("what are you, dumber than a sack of hair?") but I was not wrong. The reason is the difficulty in predicting how your cards are going to affect your outcome given all the other cards out there. That said, if you don't mind a bit of chaos in your card game, Chronicle is pretty damn good. We played with five, but I think it would have been better with three or four.

I've played too many trick games over the years, but I still managed to enjoy Chronicle with its unique take on the genre. Japanese seem to have a knack for creating seemingly chaotic card games, where skill actually matters a lot. 

I personally don't understand the complaints about Chronicle's pace. The game flows fast, thanks to clever symbols on the cards.

RATING: 7.1
Somewhat reminiscent of Was Sticht. Special abilities look a bit confusing for the first time, but after getting used to it, it works quite smoothly. I like that non-lead suit cards are played face down, that the hand size for each player can be different, and that the remaining hand will be added to one's collected tricks. The multiple-history-cards variant makes the game more interesting. The artwork is really nice too.

It's a Japanese trick taking which had some potentially good ideas. The core of the game is that each card has a special ability and each round has various objectives.

The main problem is that every card played activate a special ability. This has the problem of slowing down and breaking the pace of the trick taking game. So the game becomes longer and makes it more boring.

I think the solution would be that a special abilities does not take effect all the time. ex: Only the leading card activates it's ability, or abilities only take effect if you do not follow suite, etc.

Most of the time, we end-up taking no trick at all and it seems to be good not to take tricks which makes player getting lazy and not making any effort to win.

So great ideas, bad implementation.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
LIKE:

* There is some planning that is involved after a play or two.  With only three suits but a number of wilds that can do some wacky stuff, you never feel totally in control.
* Each number has the same action regardless of suit.
* Trick taking game where special powers can really make your head spin.
* Favorite part was where one person could end up ending the round before other people were out of cards - brought in a different strategy at times where you could try and speed up a round to suit your strategy since leftover cards in the hand become allies.

DISLIKE:

* First play is a bear and painful as everyone learns the various special actions and how the game plays.  With less people the game feels like it lasts longer since everyone gets more cards.
* I'm not sure this game sets itself apart enough from other trick taking games to purchase or not.  I'm happy to have it, but I'm not sure if I'll pull it out that often.

I really enjoy trick-taking card games. Spades, Bottle Imp, Condotierre (of a sort), Mu... However, for 4-5 players non-team games, I think Chronicle (and Mu) are the best. I LOVE the idea of a constantly shifting playing field in that the cards perform special powers when played face-up. This game plays fairly quickly and it time-scales really well (first to 3, 5, 7 'fame'). Great artwork and a first-rate card game experience.

Trick taking game, but you are not necessarily looking to take tricks as there will be a separate goal each round you are trying to achieve.

This is a cute if unconventional little-trick taking card game.  The strangest thing is the way the tricks can end before each player has played a card - so some players have more cards in their hands than others.  I love the way the theme comes through though - very unusual for a trick-taking card game!

I'd like to play this game much more so I can tell whether it is completely random or much more strategic: it's probably somewhere in between.

I'm a big Seiji Kanai fan, so I expected to like this game. It really does feel like Love Letter if it was a trick taking game. The one major downside I see with this game is the luck factor. There is a lot of room for creative card play, which can lead to some huge swings and plans being foiled. Also, certain cards are nearly worthless depending on the event for each round. If you can put up with that, however, Chronicle is an excellent card game.

An excellent trick taking game.  Three suits have 10 cards in them each, with the 'ones' being 'evil'.  6 wild cards, with one of them 'evil', making a total of 4 'evils'.

Like in standard trick taking games the leader starts off with a card and others need to follow suit.  Each card you play has an ability which changes things up a lot (each suit has 10 cards, each corresponding card in each suit has the same ability).  If you do not have the right suit you can play a card upside down (the ability does not get used), or play a wild.

Lastly, each round a new goal is flipped over that says what you need to chase after to score a point in the end, HOWEVER, if you score one evil, no points for you...if you score ALL evils, TWO points for you and NO points for anyone else (shooting the moon)!

This may take the place of Tichu for me in time...

It's a [thing=143073]Tute[/thing] (a popular spanish trick taking game) on steroids, with 3 suits, half a dozen jokers and a different random goal each round. You are forced to follow the suit or play joker, but you don't need to play a higher card. Each card, joker or not, has its own ability that will be excuted when played (except if you don't follow the suit or play a joker). And in these abilities you can see the design: they have made sure there is no dominant strategy, each card has at least 3-4 cards that counter its benefits or neutralize them. 

The game is quite thinky, especially when you start the round. There are many possible strategies, depending on the cards already played, and as I said, no winning moves, but you still can pull some moves that have less chances to be thwarted, or at least you need to make sure the card you will play (or won't play) will not turn against you. "What can happen if I play these cards?" "What cards the other might use against this one?"

But Chronicle is uncontrollable. There's at least 3-4 cards/ways to counter every card/move. It is literally impossible to pull any nice move if it's not out of pure luck, even in the last rounds. It is just too random. 

And this, for me, is its main drawback. Why do you make a game so thinky when thinking leads to almost nothing? The game drags a lot because of this and it's quite frustrating to find that all your good efforts produce no rewards. Of course, I guess that further gameplay will make the decisions more automatic and the game will become less thinky. But whay should I want to play a game with an auto-pilot? Or why should I want to become an expert in Chronicle when there are many better similar games around?

If I want to think a bit, I will stick to Tute or [thing=215]Tichu[/thing], where you have much more control over what happens. If I prefer something lighter, I still have [thing=142039]Lost Legacy[/thing] or [thing=129622]Love Letter[/thing], from the same author: they offer me a higher degree of control with less thinking and less dead time.

I've only played 2 very quick games of this so I probably haven't given it a fair shake, but I didn't like it.  Seemed like there was little choice if you had a duff hand of cards and half the game seemed to be spent playing for tricks that had absolutely no bearing on winning or losing the game.

A trick taking game where each round has a different set of criteria to claim the win (most cards, least cards, most reds, most 1's, etc). It's difficult to love after the first playing. It's made slow by everyone learning the powers that each rank holds, and which take effect every single time someone plays a card which correctly follows the lead. And the powers are quite strong, so there's extra time required to figure out what to play next and what to keep back. Powers include reversing order (so 1's win rather than 10's), returning cards to hand, stealing "won" cards from other players, etc. Throw in a few wild cards which automatically win a trick, and you need to be prepared for chaos and you need to keep track of exactly which cards are left as well, which ain't as bad as all that given it's only a 36 card deck. To make it even trickier, if by the end of the hand you have a 1 or the wild demon in your collection, you're ruled out for the win - unless you get them all and then you score a double win! So usage of collection manipulation powers is vital. I want to play it again to see how it feels when everyone knows the powers well and has a faster feel for the right cards to play. I wouldn't be surprised if it then finds a place in the trick-playing rotation as a quirky fit. It provides lots to think about each hand - well, each trick really - and that's always a good thing.

A great trick taking game where each card has a special power. At first it is tough, but as you play, you know the powers and can play accordingly. Also, the goal of each game changes, so just winning each trick is not the best strategy, especial since you cannot win if you have an "Evil" card.

The conclusion from as well Koenraad as Stefaan afterwards was 'there are worse trick taking games'. I agree, but there are certainly better. Overall I'm not a big fan of track taking games were the cards have special powers (with the exception of Love Letter from the same designer).

We played with 5, then you don't have so much cards and can really have a good or a bad hand depending on the event.

I'm a sucker for small but meaty card games, so I had to pick up Chronicle once I'd read a couple of reviews of it. I messed up the rules first time out (forgot that cards left in hand get added to allies) but have played a couple of times since and really enjoyed it. There's a fair amount to digest - it's basically a simple trick-taking game, but every card has a special power - but once everyone's got the rules down, it flows smoothly and has lots of delicious opportunities for screwage. Definitely a game where tracking cards helps, but since most played cards stay face up on the table, that's not too onerous.

Special power trick taker where the rules change each round, i.e., "most blue cards wins," "most red cards," etc. Even if those are the same things functionally, it's still nice to have to recalibrate each round ("Ok, now what do I have to do?").

Some people don't enjoy the perceived chaos of this one, but I quite like the twist on this, which is that after you win a trick, now you're on the hook to defend it, as those cards are technically still in play.

RATING: 7.5
2011-04-17 Finally got the English version, which means this game will get played more often. Slight drop from 8 to 7.5.

This game usually lasts only two hands, which is the maximum hands I'd want to play in one sitting. The pacing of the game is simply quite slow. Hopefully, it will increase as more players become more experienced with all of the special powers.

However, I find that traditional trick-taking games have more staying power and strategic depth. In traditional trick-taking games, it's all about manipulating your opponent's hands by forcing them to play certain cards. In Chronicle, it's all about trying to make the best of the special powers that you have and a little less about anticipating what your opponents are going to do.

Sometimes the random objectives will render an entire suit uninteresting. So winning or losing certain tricks doesn't affect the game at all. 

2010-05-04 UPDATE: This should have been the sleeper hit of Essen 2009 from Japon Games, not Parade!

This is the kind of game where you have to know how every special power works before you could appreciate the design of this game, and thus control the chaos of the game.

Simple example. The 3 of every suit reverses the order of the cards. So if you want to win a trick with a high card, or lose a trick with a low card, you'll have to wait until the 3 of that suit has already been played (or it's still in your hand). So traditional trick-taking strategies of trying to determine what cards your opponents are holding still apply here, but you can't simply think of high cards and number of cards per suit -- you have to consider the special powers of each card too.

This is an excellent three player trick taking game, since you have much more control over your own cards. Also, because all captured cards *have* to be face-up, there is no need to remember which cards have been played already!

===========

Very tactical trick taking game. Each rank has a special power that's activated when you play it to a trick (provided that you followed suit).

Some criticisms, though:

I don't like it that much at 5 or 6 players. It's way too chaotic because the special powers that each card possesses change the game a lot.

In each round, an objective card is flipped over. For example, who ever wins the least red cards gets a victory point. Make sure you play with the variant in which you play with two victory cards. Because most victory conditions are based on capturing (or ignoring) a specific colour of card, and because there's a great deal of flexibility in card play, sometimes you'll simply receive a hand of cards with which you can't do much (especially in 5-6 player games).

What I like about traditional trick taking games is that their trick taking rules are strict enough that you could control what cards your opponents must play. The special powers that each card possesses makes this much more difficult to do (and makes it way more tactical). Perhaps after repeated play, we'll start anticipating better the special powers that other players have. Also, because at the end of a hand, cards still left in your hand count towards cards you want, there's a valid (and somewhat passive) strategy of simply not playing a card if you want to win it.

Games are short, but that's because victory conditions are short too. So games move a bit more slowly than a typical trick taking game.

Unique trick-taking, tableau building game in which each card played to a trick has powers that can alter player's tableau or the manner in which the trick is won. Win conditions also vary round to round.

My greatest criticism is that rounds that reward having the most cards of a type in their tableau go largely in favor of the players who were dealt those cards, since any cards left in hand at round's end become part of a player's tableau.

Un bueno juego de bazas, un tute para frikis hecho por un japonés. Muy rejugable por los diferentes objetivos. Puede ser una buena entrada para no jugones aficionados a las cartas tradicionales, pero es cierto que en la primera y segunda partida hay mucha sensación de no saber qué carta tirar, se necesita una sesión de varias partidas para ir viendo cómo funciona en realidad el juego más allá de conocer las reglas, que son muy sencillas.

De todos modos, sigue estando por debajo del Tichu y de la Pocha en mi escala de juegos de cartas "tradcionales"-

#89 on my Top 100 Games of All Time (2015)

Chronicle is by the same designer as Love Letter. It's like Love Letter's overlooked older brother that is actually much more interesting. It's a trick-taking game where each card has its own special ability that activates when played. The victory condition is variable and determined before each game begins by flipping over a 'history card'. You may need to collect the most Love (red) or collect the fewest Power (Blue?). Trick-taking fans should definitely give this one a try.

I'm a big fan of trick-taking games and this is one of my favorites.  Each "meeting" (i.e. round) plays out differently based on the History Card in play that sets the goal for the round. There is so much strategy and tactics packed into this little card game. I love it!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Nice little trick taking game, where you have to balance your desire to fulfill the condition for the hand, avoid evil cards (or collect them all), and balance using the powers of the cards.  Sometimes, your decisions are even more difficult as you may not want to activate your powers, but by playing the card you'd like, you must.  Neat!

I'm a big fan of trick taking games that don't have trumps or forced bleeds.

This is a mind-bending trick-taking game. It's also vicious. Chronicle is either brilliantly deep or too much work for what it is, or maybe a bit of both; I haven't decided yet, but I'd have to play again to do so. The trouble is, there are several trick-taking games I'd rather play instead.

I'm hard to appease with light and quick games, the one exception of late being Love Letter which I quite enjoy.  This one was okay as well though.

It is a trick-taking game, which is odd that I enjoyed it because I don't usually care for them, where each round you are trying to achieve something different and each card has different special powers.  This gives the game a decent amount of depth as unlike regular trick-taking games where the goal is typically to take the most tricks, sometimes the goals are to take the least.  Also, with each card doing something different there are a lot of decisions to make and ways to break the system, for example the 3 card in each suit makes the lowest card played the winner.

Really fun game.  Simple rules, by the third hand of our first game everyone learned the card powers.  Iconography of the card power really represented the purpose clearly.

Another trick taking game but with enough wrinkles to keep it interesting. The individual card abilities makes it a little heavy going for a new player and their first turn or two (with 8 or so cards to be aware of), but the game is pretty simple once you pick it up. As with all card games, a good hand helps immensely and a bad hand can probably kill you, but there are enough choices in the game that it doesn't feel like it too much.

I also liked all the special abilities of each card and how they were mandatory.

I actually think this is a pretty fun trick-taking game. You have to know going into the game that it's very chaotic.

My main concern, as a friend pointed out about the game, is that sometimes you literally can't win a round because of the cards you're dealt. Every round has a different win condition and if you get certain cards in your hand sometimes you just can't do anything but lose. 

I'll need to play some more to see how often this is really an issue. But overall I like the game, it just has a flaw.

Game has a some nice things, the best being the variable win condition for every meeting (round). However, the mandatory powers in every card make the game somewhat chaotic.

Overall, for a trick taking game, you will be best served playing Hearts, The Dwarf King or PLAGUE/Neptune.

As I age, I find my eyesight and memory getting worse. At the same time, I find myself less and less interested in games that consist of many cards, each of which does something different and whose effects are described in tiny type on the cards themselves. I can handle basic Dominion and Love Letter because the number of cards is small, but beyond those my ugh meter goes off the scale.

Chronicle, which resembles a mutated version of the common card game Hearts, actually seems like it might be a decent game - once you memorize the appearance and effects of the two dozen or so cards - but having to constantly scrutinize every other player's tableau from across the table without knowing the cards by heart is an exercise in frustration for an aging gamer. I might actually give this game a 6 if it wasn't so much effort, but I can't be bothered.

At first it seemed extremely chaotic, but after a couple tricks it made sense and it was clear to understand what was going on.

Definitely a worthwhile, thought-provoking trick-taking game.

A bit of a learning curve to understand the card powers, but very much worth the time.  Each hand is enjoyably different from the last due to the different objective card(s).  The cards' special powers make the outcome of each hand uncertain, but not random: in any trick-taking game you are at the mercy of the cards you are dealt, but in Chronicle you have some sneaky options to compensate.

Sophisticated trick-taking card game that's essentially whist with special powers and variable victory conditions.  Seems extremely chaotic in early plays, but very quickly the intent behind the cards comes into focus:  the 3 punishes someone who leads the 1, the 2 punishes someone who leads the 3, the 4 punishes people who get good cards into their allies too early, the 8 opens up the possibility that you'll be able to dump cards from your hand into the allies at the ends, and so on.  The powers are very well balanced to their ranks.  Like Tichu, feels bewildering and chaotic at first; like Tichu, with mastery of the game comes a much more solid ability to control what's actually happening.  The Was Sticht?-like goal cards and the shoot-the-moon mechanic give you a lot to stay on top of.

RATING: 1
Based on one play with 5 players.

It starts off as a pretty basic trick taking game with 4 suits.  There's also 4 cards that prevent you from getting any score during a round, and they kind of just come out at random times to "poison" the trick.  It's rare that you get one because of poor play.  Generally it's when you were forced to play a card of a given suit, and there was nothing you could do about it.  Oh well, you just get no points this round.

To make the game worse, there is a lot of text to read on the cards.  Every single card has it's own text, and it's always a full sentence, sometimes two.  So, you know immediately that there's probably little balance in the game.

When you start playing it, you realize some of the cards just add crazy randomness.  For example, you pick one player and make them discard a card.  There is little reason to choose one player over another in 90% of the situations.  In the other 10%, you are currently winning the round, and you want the round to end, so you just pick the person with the fewest cards.  This isn't shrewd play or deep strategy, it's just doing what is obvious.  Most other cards have the same problem.

Some rounds, you have nearly zero chance to even make any choices.  You may have the choice of playing your red 5 or your red 6, but that's not interesting.  And the rest of the cards in your hand are forced to be played by the nature of the rules.

I just can't think of any games I like worse than this one, other than things like 52-card pickup or Mao.  Games that I've rated a 2 or 3 would easily be played before this.  So, I'm giving it a 1.

Poor, unnecessarily complicated trick-taking card game with a lot of different special ability cards which need to be learned/memorized and then good card combinations to be learned and variable scoring. Many will probably mistakenly claim that this adds "depth" but it does not - it simply adds complexity and randomness.

For a trick-taking game with variable powers with nearly every card played to a trick, I didn't expect to like this game all that much.  It's actually pretty impressive that the game has that sort of design, but still gives players a way of managing their hands and keeping the chaos down during the course of the game.  It ran a little long the first time we played it (probably ten hands, at just over 90 minutes), and I honestly don't see it going down, even as players become more familiar with the game.  Still, the game satisfies, partly because it's surprisingly balanced, for all the variable powers in the game.  I'm quite interested in playing this one again, but only with four.  With three and five players, the card counts seem to get wonky.

A rather fun and chaotic trick taking game, with a lot of twists and unexpected turns. Needs a bit of time to get used to the variable card powers but other than that, runs very smoothly. Caution: Lots of player screwage going around!

Trick taking card game.
Each trick has a unique win condition.
Each card played enacts different actions and carries attributes.
Light weight (1 - all info available on cards).
Medium-high player interaction.
Low theme application.

I wanted at least one trick taking game in my collection and there's no better designer to choose from than Seiji Kanai, Mr. Love Letter. I just didn't want another card games with just numbers and suits, so the unique abilities and attributes add a nice twist on the whole affair.

Best trick taking game I've played.  I like how all the cards interact and I've always like the idea of "play a card then do something" in games.

Feels similar to Palastgeflüster.
One player found it rather hard to decide what to do.
Probably too many cards for 3 players.

Trick taking card game gone 3-D. Achieve hidden objectives to collect the most fame points. Shuffle the deck of three suits and deal. Like love letter the played cards likely have special effects. And that is where the fun begins.

Nice little trick-taking game. The history cards and special abilities really screw with the nature of the game and give a different experience every hand. Actually plays in 30 minutes even with 5. Wish it played better with less than 4 since table time will be limited.

This is an interesting not-quite-filler card game based around trick taking. The card deck and changing VCs work very well together, and it is fun to try and plan around the different card-swapping/stealing/passing abilities. It's easy to figure out what your opponents have in-hand, but it is an entirely different beast trying to predict and counter what they're going to do.

UPDATE: Have been playing this a lot, since one of my pals took an immense liking to this one.

Surprisingly well designed trick-taking game with card special powers. It takes some 3-5 plays in order to get, as you have to learn what powers there are. Once learned, it's a game of tricking and guessing and thinking, with wonderful swings. Variable goals (sometimes, the goal is to win as many cards as possible, sometimes not to win any tricks at all) combined with the weird card powers forms a game that really shines on 3 or 4; on 5 or 6 it quickly becomes too chaotic without control.

Three suits, numbered 1 to 10, and 6 wild cards that either auto-wins or auto-loses a trick. Powers are very well thought through. Nothing left to chance.

I've earlier thought this works for light gamers, but I don't think so… this is a pretty heavy game, as it takes the players knowing the cards for it to shine.

I'm always playing with the house rule that the Sage lets you regain any card, even from the discard. Makes the whole game a lot more interesting.

A very quirky game that, at first blush, appears to be riddled with randomness. I think once familiarity with the cards is achieved, some of that might go away.
The artwork is bold and very charming. The effects on the cards are interesting, but I wish at least one card would allow retrieval from the 'removed' pile.

Ураганная игрушка. Небольшая колода карт, 4 масти. Цели на каждый раунд. И вуаля - одна из самых приятных малышей. Круче только Love Letter.

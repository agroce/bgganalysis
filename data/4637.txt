Perfect first roll and move.  The choices can be too stressful for my three year old, though.  He doesn't want to be responsible for killing the cute little rodents Max the cat hunts.

UPDATE:  He is now just turned 4, and played the game through with some focus and smart decision making.  It helped that we rolled a lot of green and won.

Rated as a kids' game. Max is something like Candyland, only with a psychopathic killer chasing you along the path. It's tense. It's tense for the grownups! When Max lands on (and messily disembowels) one of your critters everybody looks at each other like "uh..."

One of my most requested games by my 3 year old. I like that it is a cooperative game so that we can be on the same team when we play together. Unfortunately, it has really poor components. I will probably get some wooden pieces from a craft store and replace the ones in the game.

A perfect game for my 3 and a half year son.  I thought it was a little too simple at first, but he has shown me how a good theme can build tension in this little game. We've had good father-son time with this one.

RATING: 4
This is a strange game.  The first time I played this with my kids (age 6) they got bored and we barely finished it (even though the game was only about 10 - 15 minutes).  However, now, a year later, they have asked to play for it themselves several times.  From an educational perspective, this is a great game that teaches cooperation.  I just wish the components were more than just carboard chits (it would bother me less in an adult game than in a kid game).

Adult Play = 1; Kid Play = 6;

RATING: 8
Great coop game for 4 or 5 year olds.  Demands a light level of strategy and the ability to see ahead to the next move.  The theme makes for a more powerful experience, and my daughter definitely gets into it in a light role-playing kind of way.

My 2.5 year old son is not really grasping this game yet. He tends to want to fly away with the little bird though.

This hasn't been played in awhile, but when my kids were in the preschool/kindy range, we got a lot of use and family fun out it.  (I was notorious as a pushing-my-luck accidental creature-killer.).  As young children's games go, it's a good one, and I've rated it on that basis.

Noel's Game -- he completely understands the play mechanic along with the shortcuts, I think there's just no motivation for him to play.  In fact, he cheers for the cat and doesn't want to send him back to the porch, preferring instead that he pick off the poor little animals.  We rarely make it around the first corner before the animals run to the tree and the cat goes home for a snack.

[Rating is for kids] A nice little cooperative game. However, my three-year-old daughter was too young when I tried it with her - she did not seem too interested by it, the one time we played. I need to try this again now that she's older.

Bought June 2008 as gift for daughter's birthday.

Theme works very well for her.  Lots of discussion during this one which is a bonus.  We play with less cat treats to make it a bit more exciting.

She has no problem with the cat eating the yummy animals.

An excellent game that I highly recommend for any young family.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Plenty of decisions for the kids to make.  My daughter gets really upset when Max catches one of the critters. She really gets into the strategies of moving the critters vs. sending Max back to the porch w/ a treat.  Actually, she 'knows' when Max is about to catch a critter-she'll 'double count' spaces or skip spaces to avoid the consequences of Max 'eating' the critter.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
My girls 6 and 8 play this frequently, they like the cute theme and campy artwork. I think it is best for kinders, where it teaches turn-taking and simple decision making. It's got a theme which leads to "teachable moments" when the cat inevitably gobbles down one of the cute critters (cats need to eat too!). The co-op play means the girls aren't competing against one another which helps to bridge the age gap and limits tears. Highly recommended as a first board game. The game is deep enough that my oldest girl (now playing Castle Panic and Forbidden Island) still enjoys an occasional game of Max---though she likes to play the side of the cat these days.

It's simplicity defies it's depth. Kids are accustomed to cats chasing mice, eating mice, happens all the time in childrens stories and rhymes, cartoons and such. But something about the artwork, or maybe it's the bird... they really think about what it means, about the circle of life, when they play Max. Be prepared for cheers, and tears.

RATING: 6
It's a fun game for my 2.5 & 5 year old.  Mr. 5 yr old gets the game completely, while Ms. 2.5 only gets the rule about giving Max a treat.  It's fun to play with them and try to save the animals.  Btw, both are aware that cats eat little creatures, so we try to do our best to save the animals but sometimes the cat gets to eat.

Nice little cooperative game for kids.  really refreshing break from other standard roll and move kids games - and it's usually a close game, but I'd say it's toughness is set at about 60% win.  Would say that Lion Guard Protect the Pride Lands would be a good next step up after Max.  Both Coop. Both moving a common set of pieces.

RATING: 6.6
My rating for this game is based on my interest in playing with the appropriate aged child.

This little co-op game is actually a little exciting.  Max can catch up to the little animals fairly fast.  Although we usually win, and rescue all the animals, it is always close, and thrills the children.  The themed mechanics of Max the cat being able to track his prey off the path, sitting on the last space and waiting for the prey to arrive, and putting out tempting treats to distract him, are clever.

This is a cute game for the very young gamers. My 4 and 6 year old girls enjoy it. It is basically just roll and move but with more excitement. You have 2 dice each with back and green dots. You roll them both and if its green you move the creatures towards home and if its black you move Max towards the bird, mouse or chipmunk. Its cooperative so they are all trying to get the creatures back safely, working against max as a team. Their are shortcuts also and you can call Max back to the porch 4 times during the game if he is getting close to them. Much cuter than Candyland, IMO.

RATING: 9
A great co-op game for kids, or to play with kids.  At first it seemed like it was pretty easy to win with all of the animals making it back safely, but after playing a few more times, there have been more casualties, even 2 animals per game, so it's harder than it seemed, initially.  It's mostly luck-dependent as far as the dice rolls go, but there are some crucial decisions as far as when the best times are to use the treats.  Those decisions will be obvious for adults and many older kids, but they are great to observe and learn for younger kids.

He would rate it a 10 because he can't imagine not wanting to play it forever, but I do know he'll outgrow it at some point. In the meantime, we'll play 5 games in a row, and he'd keep on playing it if we would... A totally awesome cooperative game for the very younger crowd. It's amazing how exciting and tense this game is for really young kids...

Superb, simply superb.

[i]Max[/i] is a terrific little kids' game held back by limited distribution and cheap production, like cardboard chits for pieces. I've played this a lot with several kids, 4+ years. Once a kid gets the hang of it, it works without an adult, including as solitaire. My rating is in the context of playing with one or more kids of 4+ years old. There are kids' games that I am happy to play with adults, but [i]Max[/i] isn't one of them.

Be warned that [i]Max[/i] packs some drama. Tears were shed in my house the first time an animal was lost. That sounds terrible, but it turned into a discussion about predators and the food chain. Being cooperative, losses are easier to bear, and everyone celebrates saving the animals that made it. Better yet, there are degrees of victory.

It takes time for the kids to see it, but kids can discover tactics in [i]Max[/i]. That's a rarity for young childrens' games, which are often choice-less.

This is such a great game for kids around kindergarden age. Cooperative sort-of-roll-and-move, but already with some strategic options that even the younger kids can already grasp.

RATING: 6
My 3 year old boy is more interested in Max the cat than the little critters.  He always likes to move Max, and likes the treats to move Max back home.  He is perfectly happy to see Max eat the critters.  The game is supposed to be a co-op, but when we play it is more like a co-op with a not-so-hidden traitor every time.

The gameplay itself is quite nice, and a challenge to win.  Sure, it is entirely luck based with the rolls, but the choice to send the cat home and moving the critters to keep them off the shortcuts is a nice design.  I'd say 4 to 5 year olds is the sweet spot for this game.

As a 4 year old, my son is able to make all of the decisions on his own.  Only needs a reminder about how the shortcuts work for Max.

As a five year old, my son continues to enjoy this game.  The decision of when to set out the treats for Max continues to be his favorite.  My 3 year old daughter has now joined in, and this game is instructive for her to follow rules, and the theme holds her interest.

Rating based upon how eager I am to select this for a game with children.

RATING: 7.25
Kids (5 and 3.5) seemed to really like it, but didn't enjoy having the critters get "captured" (a.k.a. eaten) by the cat.  One game all creatures met their demise and the second game, all made it to the tree (with a judicious re-roll).  Tough game for that age bracket.  I'm not sure if the game has "legs" though, bacause as soon as the kids learn the trick of letting Max pass them early and then start following him, how much difference can each game session really be?

Rating as a kid's co-op game.

It's a nice little game.  May be dependent on playing the cat role up a little bit (with mrooarrwrrs and the like) to build any tension whatsoever. I'm wondering what the %'s of victory are with well-played food-nibbles. Since both dice are 50/50 chances of animals or cat movement, t would just take adding up the number of moves it takes for the animals to be free vs the number of ...  oh, what the heck - I'll look at the board image on its entry here.

*looking*

Wow - that's pretty cool - the outcome of this game may be dependant on Max the cat getting moves quickly in the beginning. The farther the animals get from Max, the more moves the food enticements take away from the cat.
I saw a lot of 2-green rolls in Michael's game, so presumably there could just as easily be multiple 2-black rolls that would doom the animals.  :devil:

Nice little game.

great cooperative kids game, well balanced. Good for starting discussions of strategy. Box says age 4, probably older 3's or even late 2yo's who want to have a turn could be encouraged to roll the dice and move. (if they can handle Snail's Pace Race, they could be talked through this) You only have to count to 1 "twice".

My 3- and 5-year-olds like this little game, and it's a good lesson in strategy.  Not so much in ecology, but it tries.

Great game for little kids to play with an adult.  Lots of fun, non competitive and still complicated enough to hold the attention, not just a roll and move thing.

RATING: 9
Lots of fun even with just adults, in this case my folks. We introduced some variants, like when Max would follow the shortcuts, number of treats, one player responsible for each animal, and found it even more fun. Splendid game for kids and family.

The rating is for playing with small kids (ages 4-6).  It is easy, but as far as games with small kids, this one is fun for adults.

Fabulous game for 4 year olds! We own many 4+ games, and this one is both the kid favorite and the parent favorite! Have already bought twice as birthday gifts to other 4 year olds. Would recommend to strangers on the street! :-)

Wow!  I was suprised at how good this game is!  We got Max and The Secret Door at the same time, and I like Max more!  My kids (2 & 4) love it.

The two small children I played this with (3-5 years old) loved it. I enjoy advising them on making good decisions as well. Candy Land is going in the trash. Helps children use reasoning and logic in a simple, fun way.

RATING: 7
Seems like a great first roll and move game.  Nice balance of cooperation among players and tension provided by the cat.  Some real decision-making and it's the right length for what it is.  

Much better than Snail's Pace Race, which usually fills this niche. 

Production values could be higher, though.

My five year-old son asked to play it three more times in a row, so it must be a good one.  The cooperative aspect is uncommonly good for a children's game and it does offer some strategic decisions as well.  The theme really captivated him too (and myself to a certain extent!)

RATING: 6
Far better than, say, Candyland. And it makes for an interesting conversation with your little ones: Max is going to get the animals, which one do you move? "Max can eat the chipmunk...that's okay." I also overheard, "The bird is dead now. Max killed it." And no one was distraught. I know I've worried about how to introduce death and the natural order of things to my kids, and this game has sort of broken the ice. As far as game mechanics go, it's not bad and complicated enough for little ones without being too much. Furthermore, it is a cooperative game, which is great. More co-op kids games please!

RATING: 9.5
This is a children's game--and one of the best for the very young who are moving up from Go Away Monster and Cranium Cariboo.

My daughter requests this one more than any other and it has actual decision points in the game--which creature to move and how much (if you get a double move roll).  We initially missed the fact that Max moves through every shortcut--this worked well when she was a couple months younger as it made it easier to win with the creatures.

The production values are well, very low.  Everything is (not cleanly) hand drawn and the box art is quite the before-computers cut-and-paste example.  If this game were something to be played by several iterations of children (we're a 1-child family) and you had the skills, you might consider upgrading all the components to wooden critters and treats.

RATING: 10
10 for children.  7 for adults if you enjoy watching the kids have fun and can make some sound effects and a wild story.  If you have a 2-4 year old, I wouldn't look any further.  This is a superb children's game.  Don't get into thinking about the bits too much, they're fine.  The gameplay last a perfect amount of time.  The little creatures are just the right size and Max is adequately "evil" enough for this age.  It's cheap and purrrfect.

Re-Review after 2 years:  This is, despite the rather homely graphic quality, one of THE best children's games.  There is a drama to this game like no other children's game.  The rules are simple enough for children down to about 2 1/2 I would say--with help.  My 3.5 year old loves it.  My 10 year old girl enjoys the fact that it has these cute critters in it, so she makes up sounds for them for the little guys and develops simple story lines for them.  

I enjoy that it hits the game time length sweet spot for children--15 minutes.  At that point, you can put it away for a couple more days.  

Don't forget, it's entirely cooperative, but each player can make their own decision, good or bad, about the path of the little critters.

It's similar, in feel, to HABA's Orchard, but significantly less costly.

If you have small children and don't have this game, you're missing out.

I am rating this as a kids game.

I have played a few games of this with my 6-year old niece and she likes it a lot.

She is not a very sensitive kid and the idea of Max catching the creatures is not troubling for her, though she does favor the bird.

This is a great game because it is light enough for very young kids, but is still kind of fun for adults.  The decisions are not terribly difficult, but it is quite fun to watch it play out.  The mechanics work and there is actually a game there.

Components are more than serviceable, but far from plush.  I actually think the art suits the theme and age-level very nicely and the game was obviously a labor of love.

The game scales well from 1-3.  I have not played with more than that.  While it technically handles up to eight, I would think that the lower end of the spectrum is a little more interactive.

The real fun was in cheering for our creatures and holding our breath as Max closed in.  I read some reviews before purchasing and many speak of kids becoming invested in the outcome of the game and that was our experience too.  It is exciting when you win and a bit of a bummer when you lose, but the good part is that the game plays so quickly you can try again and end on a good note.

I highly reccomend this for young kids.

Update: The rating stays the same for 1-3 players. As the numbers go up the rating ticks down a bit. The game plays quickly and it's a co-op, but, remember, this is aimed at  younger kids. They don't like waiting for their turn.

I have heard of people creating their own Lord of the Rings version with Frodo, Sam and Gollum trying to get the Mt. Doom. How awesome is that! And yes I plan to make one with my daughter someday.



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 4
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 4
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 4

Wonderful kids game, especially great because it's one of few good cooperative games available for young children.  Pieces are a little unpolished, but the game costs barely more than $10, so that is to be expected.

Good game for taking the next step after "Candyland" and "Chutes and Ladders".  Still has a strong luck element, but allows for a number of different decisions to be made that dramatically alter how many critters Max catches.  Obviously wouldn't play it with my older friends, but always happy to run a game with my kids.

This is a game for kids.  A great one too.  The cute little animals don't always escape Max the cat so kids learn that losing is sometimes a part of playing.  Much more playable than "Harvest" another cooperative game from Family Pastimes.

We love this game.  It is perfect for the younger group.  Unfortunately the pieces have been going astray, but it is easy to replace most of them by cutting some circles in cardstock and drawing on the part.

Very good co-op kid's game.  This is one of my little girl's favorites.  She sometimes does get a little disturbed when the cat "eat's the little animals" but then it gives us a reason to play again.

Max is a wonderful game for young children. It was my younger daughter's favorite game when she was 4. It's roll and move, but with the choice of which of the three animals to move. That choice alone elevates it above most other games of its kind, and the theme and simplicity of play makes it a hit with little kids.

Of course this is rated as a kids game.  It's a terrific co-op for kids in that 4 to 7 age range.  I will say that if you have raised a kid as a gamer, a 6 or 7 year old might get bored with it.

Played with my 4 (nearly 5) year old niece and she loved it. An exellent opportunity for them to begin role play (!) and learn strategy.  The decisons are yours to make - beats snakes and ladders etc.  If was rating as a kids game I would do about 8 I think - better pieces would make it a 10.

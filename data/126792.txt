Previously rated an 8 because I really like the gameplay, I feel I have to increase my rating. It's quite brave to design a game this way instead of making it the umpteenth game featuring a Roman setting or a generic Fantasy theme like Orcs against whatever. This brilliant choice for a theme has exactly hit the spot, as it's even immensively fun to play the game, being an ant colonization. I love it!

Excellent knife walk game with a very thematic feel. There is a bit of solitaire feel to the experience and it is nearly unforgiving in the early turns (only the final turns feel like you can execute your plan). The need for food stores at the end of a year feels Feld or Rosenberg in the brutality. However, the variety of options and the mental strain of sacrifice everywhere is wonderfully challenging. I liked it!

Maravilloso euro de gestión y planificación de tu hormiguero! Winter is Coming, también para las hormigas xD, así que procura abastecerte bien, expandirte y luchar por los recursos de la tierra, contra otros hormigueros vecinos. Una delicia de diseño de juego, con recursos y puntuaciones finales muy ajustados. 

Escala bien, ya que el mapa viene adaptado segun 2, 3 o 4 jugadores.

*Rating based on one play.

Pretty standard mishmash of worker placement and area control.

+Interesting, unique theme.
+Nice components (including neat little ant figures).

-Poorly done rulebook. Organization is poor, there are a number of grammatical errors, and important rules are not emphasized.
-Certain strategies lead to a lot of downtime (namely strategies that don't use lots of workers).

RATING: 7.5
+ Extremely cool visuals of running an ant colony; Good tension between trying to build your holdings and keep your colony fed.
- It's hard to say, it just feels unpolished when compared to our top favorites to the point where I don't know when we'd chose to play this.


Why it's previously-owned:
The focus and play of this game came off as being too constrained.  Everyone basically does the same thing, with perhaps small variations based on scoring tiles, and the winner is determined by very small increments.  Not exciting.
This got traded for some promos and Trieste.

This is a nice euro that tries to emulate a dispute of different ant colonies in a garden. Very fun, very interesting and with complex decisions, the theme fits very well here. In spite the different configurations in the map, it seems to me that I will be doing almost the same things from game to game, that is the only bad thing to say about this great game.

RATING: 9
Very solid tight difficult Euro, with a cool theme.  Worker placement but not of the "oh, I wanted to bake bread.  I hate you" type -- placement on your own selection, with two kinds of workers.  A difficult mix of resource management (with storage limitations) and spatial expansion/exploitation.  Hard, but not unpleasant, and quite quick for such a game.

Antiquity without the complexity and play time, but not really.

RATING: 8.85
Yes, it's a worker-placement game.....sort of; but I've never played a game like Myrmes!
You'll be totally lost in your first game; and as everyone has said, it is EXTREMELY difficult to recover from mistakes!
There's almost no luck at all in Myrmes, and (in spite of comments to the contrary) I think Myrmes has infinite replay value: there's just too many starting features that change from game to game.
Negatives? I didn't find the iconography all that intuitive. Player aids would have been a wonderful thing. There are a few graphical problems: the areas that aren't used in a 3 player game aren't exactly clear, and the black and blue tunnel entrances look horribly similar.
Early days for me with the ants: my rating may go down, but it will probably go up. 
Prepare to see your brain go up in a cloud of smoke. And don't trim your nails before playing Myrmes: you'll be biting them!

UPDATE: OK, my rating has shot up from an 8 to an 8.85! I can't see it making it to a nine for two reasons, though: the utter nightmare of trying to recover from early mistakes, and the high potential for AP.

Bought this game with great ANTicipation and it did not disappoint. Excellent blend of worker placement and tile laying. Well balanced. It can be hard to accomplish all you want but lots of options to try. Players can attempt to block you with their tile laying but it's very hard to completely block someone. You need to plan well in advance to achieve goals but you also have to react to other players moves. Plays well online at boiteajeux.net.

RATING: 6
I quite took to the ant colony theme of what's otherwise a solitaire-ish (worker placement on my own player board!) efficiency game.  Myrmes certainly taxes the grey cells in presenting difficult decisions about how to prioritise the use of your nurses (workers) between keeping the colony fed, developing it and point mongering.  It's a snowball game, so those who get ahead early will stay ahead, unless they let things get out of balance.  This is scarcely helped by a bonus for the player who completes a v.p. objective first whenever another player completes it. Myrmes does offer player interaction in the form of conflicting empires of pheromone trails, but the board only starts to feel seriously cramped late in the game.

What saves Myrmes from a lower rating from this efficiency engine hater is the relative simplicity in both the number of resources in play (just three) and the options for development.  The game also jogs along at a good pace, with just nine full turns and a small number of workers to manipulate.

Myrmes' artwork is striking, though some features - like the start spaces on the board - are quite hard to distinguish.  Lavender and blackcurrant smoothie types of objective tiles were bad colour choices too.  We struggled somewhat with the rules; they all seemed to be there, though not entirely in the right order.

Nice worker placement eurogame with minor area control elements. Players are in control of an anthole and they try to collect resources, expand their colony, gather food for winter while doing what the ant-queen demands. I like the little plastic ants. The game takes around 2 hours to play and you need more than 1 play to actually understand what is going on and how to form a strategy.

A refreshing game with an unusual theme and solid game play. The two level strategy is a brain burner and it requires out of the box thinking and either good maths skills or great intuition.

This is a worthy and interesting game design, but the overall theme (which insect shall I kill?) and the mechanic of losing ants, or "paying in ants" (in other words ants as currency) just doesn't quite feel right to me when I play the game. 

It makes the game feel artificial, like the ant theme is simply in service of a mechanic that the designers really wanted in the game.  In reality, I am sure that the designers tested lots of options, and likely, the only way that the design worked was for ants to die on the board once they put down their pheromone trails. 

In the final analysis, I guess thematically I just don't have the desire to play with ants very often.

+ Cute theme. Plastic ants which are fun to play with (putting a cube on top of them, teehee)
- "To put an end to this war, the council of the queens has decreed that a final battle will decide the issue of the final victory". Ahahahah, what "battle"? This is the usual bland euro-template, completely unremarkable. It's solitaire and has a narrow range of options. Maybe it's time for publishers to look for new games instead of the same thing over and over?

I've given up. I've played this 5 times already, and I just don't get it. I'm sure it's a fine game, and the theme is innovative and actually interesting. But I just can't get around the rules, so it's just no fun for me.

UPDATE:

I finally watched rahdo's great video "run-through", and finally got it. I've played it 5 or 6 times since, and decided I like it. I don't love it: the game is too punishing, as it ultimately runs too short for you to react to any kind of mistake, but it does have some interesting decisions, and it's a decent worker placement game with some cool innovations.

Up to a 7 for me. I won't go out and buy it, but I'll usually play it if asked.

Just do yourself a favor and learn from someone else (or rahdo's excellent video), instead of relying on that awful rule book like I initially did.

Myrmes is a very good medium-weight euro.
The theme is quite unusual, and it is surprisingly well represented in gameplay: you have nurse-ants, warrior-ants, worker-ants and larvae, and every piece fulfills a differen role.
The game has perfect information, and a very well implemented resource scarcity: it is one of those euros in which you're playing against the game as well as againts other players.
Maybe it is not groundbreaking since it has been released in 2012, but it is another very solid game from the Ystari guys!

This game has HUGE A/P potential, you basically have to plan your whole turn at the beginning of it and you really have a lot of options what to do. In our game the planning phase took sometimes over 15 minutes. I cannot see this ending in 75 minutes.

RATING: 7
First Impression: This euro has an interesting theme and some very visually appealing components. Overall the game does not hold the players' hand in any way. You must make difficult decisions from the beginning and follow the path you've chosen to completion. Although the game seems to promote direct confrontation, I believe that it may be an illusion as I haven't experience any yet in my plays of the game.

Myrmes aka 'My armies' is the title for this game about competing ant colonies.  However, I think a better title would have been 'My armpits' for I used my workers' pheromones quite a bit more than my soldiers.  Although Myrmes is mostly played with your head down in the sand, there are moments when players interact with each other.  Being a guy, I  thought that nursing would be much more exciting, but sadly your options are rather limited.  I did enjoy sacrificing larvae during the events phase and working your worker ants to death.  I'm interested in more plays.

Run a colony of ants, forage for food and potentially, fight off intruding colonies? I've enjoyed my plays of this game each time, and the variable endgame scoring does change the way that I played. 

However, I haven't played this twice with the same people so I have no idea of its longevity. The game feels short and tight in a good way. I found that people I've introduced this too spent their time dealing with the immediate things they could do, rather than snipe the good endgame points, even though I do emphasize them!

The setting of the game is worth noting too. While it isn't a unique setting these days, it's highly unusual and an interesting choice. It is also surprisingly thematic in play too!

Managing an ant colony sounds like a lot of work. And, in this game it is a lot of work. There are opportunities to raise worker ants for exploring, raise nurses for more actions, raise soldier ants for conquering, advance the technology of your colony, spray pheromones outside of the hill. Then, manage resources and food to make everything work. Certain tasks can be completed for bonus points too. I had a good time with this game and I think it might work with 2 players too since it felt fairly solitarish for me. It's one I really feel like I have to play again before I'll know if there is replayability here or not.

My rating is based on online games (Boîte à jeux). Many options each year and at each phase. It seems like a game with many different paths to victory, and a game that can be played quite fast.  Be aware of agressive players who invade your area and replace your pheromones by their own.

RATING: 8
An abstract game that is actually interesting and enjoyable, probably because the colony management and worker placement mechanics lighten the abstract core/elements of the game.  It starts off slow but then the complexity ramps up to the point that in rounds 3 and 4 of 4, the board is getting tight and your best scoring opportunities involve removing an opponent's pheromone tile (and scoring points) and then placing your own pheromone tile in its place as a combo/bonus action to score even more points.  Naturally, experienced players have an edge, but it was fun as a novice to pay fast and watch experienced players manipulate the board and mechanics to maximize scoring potential.  Note to self: remember that soldiers earn you 1 green food cube/turn.

Juego de gestión de recursos en un hormiguero. Cada jugador tiene un tablero que es su hormiguero, donde las hormigas cuidadoras tienen que escoger en qué van a dedicar su tiempo. Las hormigas pueden salir del hormiguero e ir a parar a un jardín, donde irán colocando feromonas y luchando contra otros bichos para ganar puntos de victoria.

La temática es atractiva, y es bastante cerebral. Me lo enseñó Marc, y me gustó mucho. Al final, acabé comprandomelo en Marzo 2013, después de muchísimo tiempo sin comprar un juego.

Me le acabé comprando, así que no puedo ser muy objetivo. Es un juego de gestión de un hormiguero.. con profundidad, pero con pocas fichas para manejar. Es muy rápido.

Las partidas se parecen todas un poco al principio, pero una vez que le vas cogiendo el truco, se van descubriendo caminos nuevos a la victoria. 

La rejugabilidad aumenta por la posibilidad de cambiar de objetivos de una partida a otra. Hay tres niveles de objetivos, dos de cada nivel. En el juego vienen 6 losetas de cada nivel, así que hay muchas combinaciones.

A mí me gustó desde el día que me lo explicó Corwin. Es una gran adquisición para mi colección.

What a beautiful blend of theme and mechanics.
The way they explain the route-building and the use of different workers. Simply great.

I think it's nice to look at. The artwork isn't beautiful but it is artistic realistic. I like that.

The only thing that is a little out of the line is the fact that you have to place pheromones according to your colony level. Wouldn't it be more realistic if you could place a pheromone UP to your colony level?

But that is really my only complaint.
The game works perfectly, has a super smooth gameplay.

I really really really like it.

And besides all that it has such a strategic depth that you need several games to discover everything what the game has to offer.

How can a game about ants make my head explode?

You know, the world is full of worker placement games, and others, where you just can't seem to do everything you need to, but this game always leaves me thinking I can't do ANYTHING I need to.  Making new ants -- workers or soldiers -- is expensive as heck, but when you send them to do anything, they die!

I find this game incredibly frustrating.  I admire the heck out of the design, and it seems honed to a knife-edge.  I just can't decide if I actually like it.  (Which is why my rating is lower than it deserves.)

Just when you've finally built up to the point where you can start doing things, the game is over. I don't think this is a bad thing, but like many other Euros (Eclipse, Goa, Vinhos), at the end of the game you'll wish you had a couple more turns.

Truly a great game. There's quite a lot to think, but it's still short to play. No randomess but the event die, but with objectives, it's still enough for a great replayability.
Interaction is not usual, as it's not a worker placement and the war really occurs in the garden, for the space and pheromon cleaning.
I love how objectives and dices can really change the shape of a game. 
I've won by doing all of them, but also by ignoring them, so everything is possible. 
The game can be really violent if players want to aggress there neightboors, but new players will tend to play peacefully.

Have seen this described as worker placement, which i generally am OK with. To me this does not fit the definition of worker placement, as in action drafting. There is no competition for actions, and actually no interaction to speak of in the entire game. A fairly boring and repetitive puzzle that seems basically obvious in its play.

This was a gift from my first Secret Santa – yay, thank you again! I’m a sucker for eurogames and this was a good one. It wasn’t great, but it wasn’t bad either. Both of my plays have ended with extremely close scores with players pursuing vastly different strategies which indicate there isn’t a superior strategy. The roll of the dice in each season means that each game will play out differently, but it’s not a random roll as you can always plan for it.

The interaction in Myrmes is good (compared to some other eurogames at least) as you can attack your opponents and remove their pheromone tracks on the player board! Besides from this, though, you cannot really affect the game, though you can get some extra points if you are the first to fulfill a certain goal and the other players later fulfill that goal too. Speaking of these goals, they too make the games different from play to play so you constantly need to adapt your strategy. I liked how there are two kind of workers; the nurses who can do various things including making workers and warriors, which can be used on the main board. I like spatial elements in most games, and this is no different; it’s rewarding to place your pheromone tracks and to attack the other players in order to put down your own stuff.

Myrmes was a pleasant experience and I would be happy to play it again, though I fear the replayability is somewhat limited; not because of the different options which vary each time, but because I think the game could become a little tedious over time. We shall see…

Played at Essen 2012.  I didn't particularly enjoy it while I was playing, but it's grown on me as I've thought about it - and I even had the opportunity to teach it later.  One complaint that was given was that there was nothing for one of the players to do in the endgame - he had no room to expand, no time to set up a new ant hole or clear space for new pheromones, so the last two seasons he had nothing profitable to do for some of his nurses/workers.  Maybe a default "1 victory point" action would have helped that feeling.

RATING: 8
This game should be right up my alley, being an engine building game with cube management but also having a board where the players contend for space and resources. I do like the game, but at the same time I feel there are some problems.  The biggest problem is that the rich definitely get richer and the biggest culprit is the continuing points players get for getting to the point scoring objectives first.  This is a problem when also considering there are no clear catch up mechanisms, so it's is kind of easy to see who is out of the game going into the last year (the last third of the game).  I also feel that turn order can become a big factor with no way to control it, as in a 4 player game the person who goes first on the first time also goes first on the last turn.  Another minor grumble is that AP can get a little bit much in the later game, and looking at what other people are doing with their nurses can add a little to this, so I do think the game could benefit from some shields or hidden nurse placement. Outside of these concerns, I do think the game is very solid and would play again in heartbeat.  The fighting over spaces and the interaction between removing other people's pheromones and getting yours down to mess them up is quite fun and challenging to plan.  I am also quite a fan of the dice determining the action bonuses for each season, which mixes the strategy up from game to game.

Surprisingly chewy.  Not the fluffy random family game it is often represented as.  Potentially suffers for being too open/generous and overly constructive.

Required variant: As each season is finished, roll the die for the matching season of the next epoch.  The game is unacceptably random without this change.

Update: Increasingly procedural and decision-light with further play.  Rating dropped from 5.5 to 4.5.

RATING: 8
Excellent ant colony management theme that meshes very naturally with the game mechanics. The colony management with the exploration mechanism has a satisfying engine build up towards the end game victory point generation goals. The end game victory points thematically have very little to do with what you would expect an ant colony would actually want and are abstract VP goals to win. This is a fairly mild distraction for a game that is otherwise fairly well matched between the theme and game mechanisms.

I have a soft spot for biological/nature themed board games and this is one of better ones. This game is nice and crunchy and possibly prone to AP from slower players, especially during exploration.

A point of irritation is that the game appears to have a couple of tiles that are mis-printed with the incorrect cost for building the special Aphid farm tile.

Pretty cool. Major props for new theme if nothing else. The game is zero randomness after setup. And setup is only a tiny amount of randomness. Which equals a game that is a little static for my tastes. Moreover, the starting positions are all symmetric, with player interaction extremely limited through the first third or so of the game. There are enough different avenues to pursue that I'm sure I'll get a few plays out of it. But I'm skeptical of of it becoming an enduring favorite.

Based on my initial sentiments, which in turn based on a game which was broken off because everyone involved was getting fed up with a bad rules explanation, I'd have to say that either Myrmes is a lousy design of moving cubes and cubes-which-became-ants around (which would put it on par with equally questionable Sylla or Assyria), or that it takes on more bite as a fight breaks out in the garden in order to secure more resources so the ant colony can develop... but still remains an average title at best.

Because the game was broken off I have no clear handle on that important outdoor phase yet, and that is, admittedly, a significant gap in my experience. I hope to remedy this deficiency in the future with a proper and full game with alert players... But still: the indoor phase I found a boring to-and-from of moving cubes around to obtain more cubes and some ants, eeking out a little food here, or a larva there. My current impression is that Myrmes started out as a fairly successful [i]simulation[/i] of an ant colony, but that the author forgot to put a game in there. That game is then, of course, the competition outside leading to various development paths inside the colony, but really, what can you do outside that would redeem the game? If it is about area control, then Olympos is a magnificent and very brutal beast in Ystari's lineup which blows what little Myrmes can offer clear out of the water. And if it is not about area control, then Myrmes is... well, what exactly? Transforming one or two resources into a new level of colony abilities, and occasionally discarding a bunch of resources for a hefty VP bonus? And doing that before someone else can? Is this supposed to make my heart beat faster?

[b]Update[/b] The retry was a lot less painful than the first time I was taught the game, and it moved along at a fairly brisk pace. I made a terrible error which more or less had the effect of shutting myself out of the game, so with permission I withdrew from the end of year two onward. I was content to watch what happened from thereon. As I suspected the area control aspect of Myrmes is not particularly attractive as you cannot really attack another player. All you can do is clean up his pheromone trails and then replace them with your own. Given how quick the game is over and how the trails are built up, this won't happen all that much until the end. So all in all the game falls a bit flat.

I must now hasten to add that that from what I could make out the events in the ant heap and in the garden nicely complement each other, giving the game quite a finished feel. This has caused the rate to be increased by 1 point. I just happen to think it isn't a particularly interesting [i]game[/i] to spend much time with, so Myrmes will not make it into my collection.

I feel like this could be good if you played it enough times to become very familiar with the rules and icons. As it is, it feels too complex for what it is. There are icons everywhere, but no good central reference defining what each one means. Trying to learn the game was a hassle and didn't seem worth the effort.

I'm intentionally not rating this game because I don't think played it enough to actually do it justice.

Components: Cool board details, though very busy. The ant colony is cool and really helps with the theme, as do the tiny ant pieces. The numbered sequence on the colony board is greatly appreciated.

Experience: There is a lot going on in this game. Like other 'feed your people' worker placement games, this can be brutal. The penalty for making a mistake is high. I don't really enjoy these games of managing a bunch of different resources, to convert them into other resources, to move things around my track, to eventually convert them all into points. At the end of the game, my board was empty and all I had to show for it were points and a pheromone trail. Not my cup of tea.

Ok, I get this is a euro. But the theme they stacked on to it is a major fail for me and made it so tedious.

Long, tedious (I said that), not even representative of an ant colony in a lot of ways. And I LOVE ants. Bees too. Have some BIG books on them... went out and studied them on my own for fun, as a kid and (I admit it) a younger adult...

The game made for silent, non social play as the relationship between game aspects made for long, indirect chains that required way too much analysis. I get that Euro gamers love this? I get that? No. No. I really don't.

I mean seriously, at one point in the game my ants lacked DIRT, and PEBBLES?  Like these resources are RARE? Fine, just memorize the rule...

Players try to become the most succesful ant colony in the garden by means of worker placement, resource management and puzzling with pheromone tiles on the central board representing the garden. There are many things to do, but your workers are few. Choices are hard. Play variability is guaranteed by a set of objective tiles of which only 6 are used during a game, and by means of seasonal events determined by the throw of a die.

Preliminary optimistic rating after 5 games, assuming successful games can really be (situationally) achieved in as many ways as I hope for. Original and funny theme which might distract from game's complexity in my eyes.
No element of chance after some random setup, but maybe one aspect where player interaction might have a slightly too big (kingmaker) effect to my taste with 3p+: Some kind of achievements providing VPs, where players who claim one first will get significant extra VPs if following players chose to get it too in a later season.

Myrmes is a fairly difficult puzzle-style game. Trying to get everything working in the right order and at the right time is challenging. There are also some opportunities for direct interaction, which is good.

But, I didn't necessarily find the puzzle aspect all that interesting. It just seemed like wading through a lot of complexity just to find a few extra points here and there.

Each game has a random set of objectives, but those objectives didn't really seem to color the overall progression of the game. Similarly, there are some slightly-random season variations in the game, but those were relatively minor. (So, I suspect the game will not vary too much from session to session.)

All in all, not a bad game, but working through its difficult logistics puzzles felt more like work than recreation. (And I often like logistics puzzles... Roads & Boats, for example... but this one just wasn't very compelling.)

Lastly, it seems like 4-player might make the game longer than it really should be. 3-player might be better. I'd also like to at least try it 2-player, to see if that perhaps pulls the game together a bit.

1 Spiel 4 Spieler: Sehr gelungenes Euroworkerplacementspiel mit dem Thema des Aufbaus eines Ameisenstaates. 
Die Kombination aus Spielertableau im Stile eines Ameisenbaus und des gemeinsamen Spielplans mit der Umgebung erzeugt viel Immersion. Auch die Kämpfe gegen andere Insekten, das Legen der Pheromonspuren, die Entwicklung der Larven zu Soldaten- oder Arbeiterameisen und nicht zuletzt die kleinen Ameisenminiaturen lassen das Thema spürbar werden. 
Dennoch sind die Eurospielmechanismen ebenfalls prägend. Es gibt neben dem Workerplacement der Ammen ein einfaches Ressourcenmanagement. Auch die Möglichkeit durch Larven den ausgewürfelten Aktionsbonus zu ändern, erzeugt schöne Entscheidungsdilemata, ist allerdings unthematisch. 
Insgesamt aber ein tolles Eurospiel. Es transportiert ein schönes Aufbaugefühl bei vorhandener Interaktion, hat interessante Mechaniken und weiß sie gekonnt thematisch einzubinden.

It was Myrmes' ant theme that first caught my attention. After reading the rules, I wasn't so sure whether I would like it or not. Gladly, I bought a copy at Spiel 2012 and haven't regret it yet. Myrmes features a nice mix of strategy and tactics coupled with a great planning mechanism. Although there are some abstractions, the gameplay is very thematic.

Additionally, I have to applaud Mr Levet for the way he handles conflict in Myrmes: You can only "attack" (read: remove) the pheromones of other players when they are used up. This gives you none, some or a lot of points depending on size of the removed pheromone, but the player that was "attacked" doesn't suffer any other negative consequences. This way, the things you have built up over the course of the game can't be destroyed by someone until they are useless to you. On the other hand, you shouldn't leave your valuable pheromones too much in the open since they are a good source of victory points for other players once they are depleted. So pheromone positions still matter.

What I'm not so sure about right now is the replayability because of the somewhat limited array of possible actions. Until now, every game I played revealed some new possibilities and strategies. Maybe this might change with further plays and the game could feel scripted. But I'm really looking forward to finding out whether this concern is unfounded or not. Until then, Myrmes receives an 8.5.

I am surprised at how this quickly became one of my favorite games. There is minimal luck in the game; the initial distribution of insects and bonus tiles, and the season rolls at the start of each year. So most of the game is how you maximize your position based on that standup, and how you interact and react to the other players.

Your first play or so, it may seem like multiplayer solitaire as you can play without interacting much with the other players, but as you play more, you'll see how important player interaction really is. Board control is the most obvious, but so is how quickly players start playing towards the bonus tiles.

A fairly tight worker placement game with an interesting theme. It has a Pezel element to it as well it was enjoyable to play but I found it was a little tighter than I like. You get the feeling that you can never get what you want in the allocated amount of time. More plays will really define if I like this game. One element of that bugged me was you cannot keep all your resources for the next round. You can only keep four or six which is very restricting and a bit silly it felt like an element that was tacked on just to ensure balance

A worker placement game which includes some neat little plastic ants.   The ant colony theme is very strongly integrated, and I was impressed by that.   Big workers (nurses) can be assigned one of four roles.   Little workers (the plastic ants) are used to harvest resources, attack other bugs, and claim areas on the main map.   Food is tight, and yes, you have to feed your “people” each winter.   The game strikes the right balance between giving you plenty of options and not enough time to do everything.   Perhaps it’s not terribly original when you strip away the theme, but it’s definitely one that I’d like to play more.

Servicable worker placement game that moves quickly. Visually everything looked ant conolny thematic and mechanically it sometimes followed suit, but there are elemants I wished It had: a better sensation of moving the ants/nurses from room to room on the player board, and the plastic ants really need to stay on the board for a cool plastic mini effect, currently they are just overworked resource coins.

While all resource management games have you convert one good to another, this one had a tad few redundant loops for my tastes.

This is an excellent game. 

Pros:
* 2-player is excellent. Nicely balanced and great player interaction.
* Very tight, strategic gameplay. 
* Just enough randomness to ensure that each playthrough feels a little different, but the winner is determined by who makes the best decisions (skill, not luck).
* Strategic depth that requires a blend of short, medium, and long-term planning.

Cons:
Can't think of any.

Neutral:
* Small margin of error. Can be difficult to recover from a mistake when playing against someone who is experienced.
* In a 3+ player game, it can be easy for 2 or more players to crush one other (true for many 3+ player games).

I hope Yoann Levet keeps making games.

It's quintessential euro action efficiency. The game it reminded me of most was Hansa Teutonica. Each turn the game asks you [i]What is best, Conan? To do A, A, B or A, C, D or load up on A, A, A, etc.?[/i] A die is rolled for each season to determine what bonus power is in play which can be modified by a player if they spend larvae cubes. The bonus power acts as an incentive for which action(s) you take. So if it's +2 larvae cubes this turn, why not take the hatch larvae action then? Well, you might have more pressing needs. Going with the bonus power action vs not is an ostensible major decision point each turn. 

You start with 3 nurse ants who can create new soldier and worker ants and/or be held back to take bonus actions at the end of the turn. Worker ants can leave the colony and head out on the board to collect resources, target prey for the soldiers, or place pheromone tiles (which offer VPs and movement bonuses for future workers). While ants of each player don't interact (no fighting here, sorry), you can clear off opponent tiles. As the board starts to fill up with pheromone tiles, you race to take the remaining spots. Finally, there's the obligatory feeding phase where you have to feed your ants (minus the number of soldiers you have).

There's nothing new here, but figuring out how to best plan your ant actions is engaging. The game ends a lot more quickly than you'd think; when they say 90 minutes they really mean it here. Fortunately for me, I was able to use my nurses to get bonus points while my opponents were still using theirs to create more workers and they didn't get up the bonus track as far as I did.

Buen eurogame de colocación de trabajadores, con un tema/ilustraciones/componentes atractivos y que encajan muy bien, un toque original de mayorías con las feromonas y la única pega de dar la sensación de estar bastante dirigido, sobre todo en los primeros turnos, lo que merma su rejugabilidad.

Rating based upon one play.  No combat but competition for resources but with fairly tight economic system which can be a bit unforgiving for beginners, and some familiarity both with gameplay, board and tiles will improve scores.  if I didn't have so many games already then one which I might buy, therefore play more, and rate more highly.  Clever but not especially unique compared with what I have already.

RATING: 6.5
Rules are a little clunky for this and there is no turn summary sheet therefore the first play there was a lot of downtime as we had to keep flicking through the rulebook.

That said it is a nice, if rather punishing, worker placement game. Most of your actions are going to destroy your workers/soldiers and there are even ways to lose the nurses you have made so there is a balancing act of not only your resources (dirt,rock,food and larva) but also of your workers, soldiers and nurses. 

This makes for really interesting decisions as the majority of the large victory points actions require ant sacrifice, i.e 1 workers and 2 soldiers for hunting a spider, a nurse for completing an objective, workers for laying pheromones but keeping them alive for  lesser gain means they are available for next season (turn).

Once again, Ystari's guys have birth out an exceptional game, a true monument in its category.

It is truly amazing to have so much strategic and tactical depth in a game that takes 90 minutes, or even less.

Planning and the sequence of phases makes every choice crucial and the possibility to adapt to opponents's choices is making the game better.

Yet with refined mechanics, the theme is smoothly integrated and delivers an incredibly immersive and addictive gaming experience.

It is fluid, logical, it runs like a clock, it is tense until the end, a truly fight of all times, i always want to replay it again and again,. Just amazing!

Icing on the cake, it also works amazingly well in a duel and replayability seems infinite.

Myrmes is what my husband likes to call a perfect information game.  There is very very little that is random about this game.  A few dice rolls, and what are your starting predators.  Otherwise you know everything ahead of time.  Including the different victory point conditions.  But because of this there is no replay-ability.  You take the same strategy every-time you immediately need more nurses, you have to upgrade your colony, it's just boring after a time through... I've played it twice now and I don't ever need to play it again.

A pleasant enough worker-placement action-efficiency game with room for some wickedly-aggressive placements to hinder one's neighbors.  But as others have commented, I believe the tech-tree is ultimately too narrow for fulfilling long-term replayability.

Is anybody else rooting for games that try to implement titles of the coveted Sim-series to the board game format? I know I am, although I haven't found a game that really scratches one of those itches. A major reason why that is so, I think, is that the Sim games are inherently single-player games.

From that angle, Myrmes actually does quite well: It, too, is largely a solitary affair. Everyone is concerned with optimizing actions inside their little ant hills ("Worker placement" on your own private player board only? We got it!), and only when the board gets crowded towards the end of the game do you get any meaningful interaction which, in turn, is largely concerned with being somewhere first and blocking the most attractive resource spaces.

Don't get me wrong, the game isn't bad. Everything fits together pretty well, the game is nicely thematic for the most part, and the teensy bits of interaction which are there do provide some interesting challenges. It's just that I prefer my board games to be more interactive than their solo computer equivalents. I'll keep looking.

I like ants, so this is a great game for me. However, it brings a lot of interesting things to the table. This is still largely a worker placement and resource gathering game, but the limited use workers/soldiers offer some interesting decisions. We're still exploring this game, but so far it is a lot of fun. I can tell now it won't be played a whole lot, but it won't be neglected either.

Ystari gebührt der Verdienst mit CAYLUS eine der 5 Wegweiser der modernen Brettspielwelt veröffentlicht zu haben. Auch danach gab es im Schatten des Überbruders immer mal wieder mehr oder minder Spiele mit französisch-chaotischem Regelwerk und einem zwangsneurotischen Y im Namen von denen MYRMES zu den anspruchsvolleren und unterschätzten Ideen gehört. Hier wuselt man als Ameisenkolonie unter Tage und huscht durch den Garten, um über Insektenjagd und Pheromonverspühung zu üblichen Ressourcen und Siegpunkten zu kommen. Dabei ist die Welt unterhalb von Biene Maja erbarmungslos: MYRMES verzeiht kaum Fehler und fordert ein scharf geschnittenes Ant Placement. Dem tollen Biologie-Grundkurs-Thema zum Trotze oder gerade deswegen ging MYRMES relativ hypefrei unter und wurde zum Schluss zu Fliegenpreisen verscheuert. Wohl dem Insektologen, der heute eine Schachtel Ameisenhaufen im Spieleschrank weiss, denn er kennt den geheimen Garten, indem ein schönes Spielerlebnis summt.

When I first started playing, I put this game around a 6 because of the poorly written rulebook. By the mid-game it was an 8. For a Euro, the mechanics are well tied to the theme. The game is fairly easy to digest and yet offers lots of complexity. By the end of the end of the game, my feelings went down to a 7. Good game, but it's so scant with resources that you are constantly fighting to stay afloat. Not a sign of a bad game, but just not my type of game. Also, the AP compounds as the game develops. Lastly, there are not multiple routes to victory as the game sets out, but some key things that everyone needs to do in order to compete. If you don't keep up with creating nurses, several turns can go by where you do absolutely nothing, waiting 10 minutes for everyone to AP the shit out of their own turns. A real pain. I brt there's a better game in here a second time around, after better understanding how the game should be played, but I'm afraid that type of scripting means this just isn't the game for me in terms of replayability. A shame. There's a lot of great elements here!

Neat title.
Very calustrophobic - you must be very careful to not to cut yourself from more actions.
There are moments when I think it's ,,scripted". There aren't many options in every step of decision tree, but at the same time if you try to predict it all for the whole year it's not that easy.
Incredibly good when played aggresively. One who say that it's a solitaire shurely don't know how to play this game. :)

After one play with two players, I love it.  The board is so, so tight, and you really, truly never have enough options to do what you want to do.  It's a beautiful game and there really is almost no luck and room for planning.  Our first game was done in under an hour.  My only gripe is that it almost feels TOO short.  Much like Wallenstein, it feels like the game ends just as you start to get your production engine going.  As they say, always leave them wanting more, right?

Very interesting elements done differently.  In Agricola, you build your player board and get resources on the main board.  This game is the opposite.  Has the tension of the aforementioned due to similar feeding requirements but feels original and  mechanically correct to its theme which is heavily present.  Great addition.

Edit:
This game needs hidden end game scoring "goals"[cards].  Endgame is anti-climatic otherwise, especially with no tie-breaker.  I think a few cards with "prey" combinations, pheromone combinations, and worker/soldier leftovers could work out.  I will post if I can get the art to look good.

I like the game though, as I re-acquired it thanks to [url=http://www.boiteajeux.net]Boite-a-Jeux[/url]. Lol

Thanks to the bgg file section for the player screens.  They are much needed too.

Good implementation of the ant colony theme, although it is a bit disappointing that the plastic ants never actually stay on the board. It is a shame, also, that the other living things in the game are either wooden pieces (nurse ants and larvae) or cardboard tokens (other bugs), and I'm not a fan of this mishmash of components to represent similar stuff. But these are just minor complaints. This is a pretty good game that rewards careful planning and is unforgiving to mistakes. You always have the feeling that you need more actions, and with so few, you really don't want to waste them. Each player has his own board to manage, but you need resources from the central board, and there is some nice competition for space in the garden. There are also public objectives, tacked-on with a silly thematic explanation, but they may generate a chunk of victory points and give something for the players to pursue besides feeding their colonies.

Myrmes is a well-designed game that just didn't really strike a chord with me. The theme fits very well and the flow of the game is very easy to follow thanks to the player boards. There are a lot of different elements, but they work together pretty well and create some tough choices.

While most of the game is a typical resource management and action point allowance game, there are a few places it really shines, primarily in the variety it offers. Before each of the three "years", dice are rolled. These dice correspond to different available bonuses and really shape the strategy of the game. While cubes can be spent to modify this bonus, it is much more efficient to play with what is rolled or only modify it slightly. Additionally, the scoring bonus tiles vary each game. This seems like it would require a lot of adaptability each game, which is a good thing.

Unfortunately, this is a very unforgiving game. Getting behind spells certain doom, and it can be clear halfway through the game that you cannot win. There are no endgame bonuses, so the scoring track tells the story the whole time. It can also be difficult to defend your territory. When claiming a new area, you will have a few turns where it cannot be attacked, but then it is forever vulnerable. There is no way to attack anyone earlier than this and there is no way to defend against being attacked once those turns are up. So even the timing of attacks must be plotted out turns in advance. 

I can see why people find this game appealing and there is plenty to recommend it. But personally I would have to be in the right mood to really appreciate something this brainburning and harsh.

SimAnt the boardgame delivers in style. Your colony has warrior ants, worker ants, larvae, nurses, a queen to feed, as well as skills to develop as you dig your colony deeper. But wait! That's not all, there's more. The action happens outside of the colony, where your ants go to die, laying pheromones trails along the way, collecting natural resources for the good of the colony, dealing with pesky spiders, and not to mention protecting one's turf from other ant colonies.

As a hybrid between worker placement (i.e., the colony), area influence (i.e., the outside world), and resource collection/conversion (i.e., the inside-outside relation), this game might scream JASE at first glance. However, this game is far from it. Not only is the game richly thematic, but also holds the potential for high interactivity (in the same way that say Carcassonne can be played nice, or like a three-way-knife-fight-in-a-phonebooth). Speaking to the latter, the game provides many opportunities to undo your opponents networks (and provides point incentives to do so) as well as opportunities to make their life more difficult (i.e., when you lay pheromones in the middle of their way, they need to sacrifice their soldiers, just to cross). Furthermore, this is not a late game move that requires you to build a pheromone path the whole way over, but rather something that is accessible to you by the second turn as the game allows you to dig holes up and out of your colony anywhere on the board.

In summary, this game (for a Euro) is richly thematic and  highly interactive (and not in the multi-player-solitaire "gosh darn it! Emily beat me to the Turnip Truck where I was going to trade my tubers for Vegetable Points" kind of way). It certainly was worthy of the Tric Trac d'Or that it earned!

----------
Dropped the rating after it seems that some early game strategies are far more profitable than others, becoming baked-in and semi-required to remain competitive (e.g., like the early Family action in Agricola).

(09/20/2013) Comment based on first play.

This is a delightful, challenging game that combines worker placement, resource management, and area control with a tightly integrated theme... about ants!

There are three years, with each year consisting of four seasons (turns). Three of the four seasons (i.e., Spring, Summer, Fall) are normal turns where players take actions with their nurses/soldiers/workers, while the fourth season, Winter, is when food is required to "make it through the winter". Three separate dies are thrown to randomly determine the default event for each season.

At first glance, it seems apparent that nurses are the primary "worker" in this game, allowing a player to generate larvae, soldiers, worker ants, or special actions within the ant colony. However, after a few plays, it becomes clear that this is only half the story, as worker ants serve as yet a different kind of "worker" in the game sense. During each season, except during winter, players simultaneously and secretly allocate nurses for birthing larvae, soldiers, workers, or for visiting the "atelier" ("workshop" in French, but actually referring to the queen's chamber). The number of births of each type depends on the number allocated for that type, with larvae the easiest to generate (1x for the 1st nurse, then 2x for the second and third nurses), then soldiers (1x for the first 2x nurses, then 1x for the third nurse), then workers (1x for the first 2x nurses, and 1x for the second set of 2x nurses). After birthing, players then take as many actions in that season as they have workers.

Larvae can be used to "adjust" the die to alter the event for the current season, so the player can get a bonus/benefit of some type during the current turn (e.g., +1 larvae/soldier/worker, +1 VP, +3 movement, etc.). They can be sacrificed for food when necessary, but are also necessary for the production of new nurses. Soldiers can be used to hunt prey in the garden area outside of the colony, in order to generate food/VP, or to reduce the number of food needed during the winter season. Workers can leave the colony, placing pheromone "patterns" (tile made up of 2/3/4/5/6 hexes) to initiate harvesting of food/earth/stone based on the terrain (larger patterns generating successively more VP), locate prey for the soldiers, clear a pheromone pattern to make way for larger patterns, clear another player's pheromone pattern for VP, or set up special tiles (i.e., aphid farm for food, scavenging for earth or stone, or a sub-colony for generating VP every turn). However, soldiers and workers are discarded after their actions. Workers could alternatively stay inside the colony and generate one larvae, food, earth or stone, depending on the "depth" of the ant colony (think "tech level").

On the other hand, nurses are not discarded after their actions, other then when they are claiming objectives for VP. If they are not visiting the queen's chamber, they are simply allocated to birth more larvae/soldiers/workers, per the schedule described previously. If they are sent to the queen's chamber, they can get "permission" to create a new tunnel exit for the colony, dig the colony deeper (to open up new capabilities and larger pheromone patterns), produce a new nurse, or be sacrificed to meet objectives that are laid out at the beginning of the game. The objectives are met if X number of resources are expended, or some other condition is met.

The components are top-notch Rio Grande/Ystari quality, the rules are excellent, and the graphics are very lush and thematic, albeit a bit busy at times. The rules were quite straightforward, with only two minor questions raised during play (i.e., what are the terrain types and what do they generate? what is the movement rate across special tiles?). The player tableaus are highly functional, serving as effective player aids. Once the Eurospeak icons were understood, there was very little need to refer to the rules, with the exception of explaining objectives.

The player tableaus depict the inside of each ant colony, but kept simplified in terms of game mechanics. The "depth" of the colony opens up more resources that could be harvested inside, as well as opening up larger pheromone patterns and special tiles when playing workers in the garden. Although there are 6-7 steps in every season, with most of them being done simultaneously, the tableaus are marked appropriately guiding the players through each step. There is very little player interaction, but where it could possibly occur is during the worker phase, where it is possible to get VP from clearing another player's emptied pheromone pattern (although the other player doesn't lose their VP), and the claiming of objectives. If players claimed a specific objective in earlier seasons, they get an additional VP boost every time the objective was claimed by a latter player.  The pheromone patterns also represent a kind of area control, where they spread out from a player's base tunnel. It is possible to squeeze out other players with strategic placement, but given the obstacles of water and prey (which must be hunted first), this is difficult. Still, "fronts" can develop. Despite having soldiers, there is no direct player conflict, other than allowing a worker to "cross" another player's pheromone pattern.

The game play was very enjoyable, with plenty of options and paths to victory. The game was very immersive in theme, as it did feel like one was running an ant colony. It is important to get a resource engine up and running, in order to meet to food requirement of winter, just like in Shogun or Agricola, so there was some pressure, but not as oppressive as Antiquity or Agricola. Some elements were reminiscent of the play in Antiquity, such as the ability to harvest far more quickly and clearing a pheromone pattern sooner (but without the pollution). It has a slight civilization feel to it as well. All in all, it did not feel like your typical worker placement, resource management, area control game, so in that regard, it scores high marks for originality and theme integration. It is a solid "8", with some room to go up.

Update (10/22/2013) 5 plays: Just finished two games of 2-player, and they were enjoyable. So many things to do, so little time! I usually don't like slow-simmer, punitive games where you have to come up with "X resources" to feed your peeps, but as an ant, I don't mind. I also don't like tight games with a few turns, but even with nine turns, there's plenty to do. 2-player also seems to play fast, and the board is balanced with enough tension. Board is fixed, but re-playability is good due to the six random objectives which require significantly different strategies every time. I'm upping this to a "9". This is a great game.

Update (12/29/2013) 8 plays: The re-playability of this game is out of this world. Random seeding of 6x objective tiles, prey, and 9x random events results in no two games [i]ever[/i] being the same. Some games are peaceful affairs, while others reward aggression. My friends amply demonstrated how to use soldiers (when the event dice favor it) to clear my pheromone tiles AND replaced them with their larger pheromone tiles! This game scales well. Superb design.

I really enjoy this game. A nice blend of worker placement mechanisms and an unusual theme. Nice artwork and clear graphic design help a lot in the teaching, and it all fits together very well. I think an expansion that adds hidden scoring would help a lot as the last turn rarely offers up any surprises as to who is the winner.

RATING: 7
An eccentrically themed action point game with excellent components. Lots of different way to score with replacing opponents' pheromones and bonus tiles being the most lucrative. Ultimately though, it's just an exercise in efficient point mongering, so there's a bit less here than meets the eye. It's undeniably the most interesting game from Essen 2012, but that wasn't a good year in my book. Almost, but not quite odd enough to make my purchase list.

RATING: 8
This is a very good one from the 2012 crop of games.  It's an intense planning game with a rather difficult title (the dictionary suggests "mur-muss").  It's one of those games where you really need to figure out your whole turn ahead of time, and there is a very limited number of turns, so you'd better get it right.  It's a worker placement game in which your workers are "nurses" and you need to choose between setting up infrastructure and getting stuff done.  Here are some things that are interesting about it: 1) the season dice, which randomize the events of the year but give you plenty of warning as to what will happen 2) Feeding, which you can prevent with a sufficient number of soldier ants (why?), but man, the actions it takes to get them 3) the importance of the order in which things happen 4) the award titles, which score the big points but are quite expensive to pull off.  Then there's the stuff on the board.  

This falls into the interesting, fairly heavy but not too long category of games which I quite enjoy. I'd like to play it at least a few more times.  I'm sure I can do better than in my first showing!

Canto fuori dal coro: non mi è piaciuto. Alquanto astratto, non vedo attinenza con l'ambientazione, se non per il caos da formicaio, del tabellone a fine partita. A suo merito resta la ridotta componente di alea, a fronte dei freddi calcoli di opportunità che richiede nel corso del gioco.

Myrmes -- This game looks cool on the table and it looks like it's going to be fun, but then it isn't.  The game takes place over the course of three years.   Each winter, players must have a somewhat onerous food pile saved or lose points.  I felt like it took a while to build my engine and a lot of actions you can do deplete workers and soldiers that are consumed in I guess suicidal missions above ground.  The game felt like it ended with too few turns and the dying worker thing was annoying me.  You also lose nurses when you claim end game scoring bonuses.  I didn't think Myrmes was fun and I turned down an offer to be gifted the game.  Doesn't seem worthy of the storage space to me and I don't really want to play it again any time soon.  I would have to add that he theme is actually awesome in Myrmes, but the gameplay isn't fun for me.

I love the theme. The mechanics are sound and compliment the theme. It's a very tight game, so once everybody knows what they're doing, making a mistake can take you out of the winning spot. I don't dislike that aspect, but it's not something I want to have all the time.

The BEST game of Essen 2012.

Wow, Ystari is finally BACK (after not-so-good Bombay, Assyria, Asteroyds and Olympos).

Myrmes is a 'true' Ystari game - demanding, requiring much of thought and planning and - above all - fulfilling and satisfying.  

Like in every good Y. game (Mykerinos excluded) you grab VPs along the way from any source possible.  I like this eking out VPs Ystari-style :)

EDIT: AMAZING.  The game doesn't lose any appeal after many plays.  On the contrary - it gets beter and better...  Wow.

RATING: 8
This one felt pretty unique. From reading the rules and playing the first round or two it seemed like it was way too restrictive to the point that you could barely get anything done and everyone would be doing largely the same things, but the game opens up (and players' paths diverge) very quickly, and you end up with a very unique game. The best part of this game is the way it forces you to plan so much all at once. You need to commit basically your whole turn at the beginning, but there's enough opportunity for players to step on each others' toes that you really have to be careful and this advanced planning can really come back to bite you if you're not careful. That said though this is also maybe the only slight problem with the game; this can cause some AP, and it can make certain kinds of players look around and keep changing their moves based on others, which could cascade if you have more than one such person.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Myrmes is an enjoyable puzzle of a game with excellent replayability due to the random objectives and bonuses each game. It plays very quickly thanks to players being able to simultaneously take most actions, but that also makes the game feel a bit too much like solitaire at times. Competing for areas of the board lessen this, but the area control isn't a huge struggle as the board isn't quite as tight as it could be. Weaknesses aside, Myrmes packs a lot in its package and is worth a play for anyone who enjoys challenging engine-building games.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (April 2013)

What a great worker placement game. I really liked Myrmes and I want to buy it :).

This is a very good strategy game. I like: (1) The graphic design of the garden and the hive, it explains all the rules so playing Myrmes is very easy and intuitive. I don’t like the black player tokens (they blend into the garden making them hard to see) or the first player token. (2) The game components are pretty nice, especially the neat ants minis. (3) The game feels pretty short as you effectively had 9 turns until the end of the game. (4) The game feels pretty tight, you have to carefully plan ahead and a mistake can take you out of the game, that is, Myrmes is a hard and unforgiving game (a plus for me:)) with difficult choices every turn. (5) The theme doesn’t appeal to me one way or another, however I can recognize it is very novel and (most important) it blends perfectly with the game mechanics :thumbsup:. (6) The rules are pretty simple to grasp, however the game is very deep. (7) The game has very low randomness, the setup, tiles and dice add some but as they are visible from a long time you can prepare for them.

I have only played it with 3 players, I think this is the perfect number but I wouldn’t say no to a 2 or 4 player game. 

I don’t have anything negative to say about Myrmes, I’m a little worried that after many plays the game will feel scripted as I feel you have to take the same actions every game if you want to succeed (develop you hive for example). 

Myrmes is a true gamer´s game. It has the potential to go up higher in my personal ratings and I want to play again soon.

Current Rating: 7.5

After a lot more plays, I continue to love Myrmes. It is now a solid 8.0 in my book. It is a great 2 player game, very quick and nasty. I prefer to play it this way now, but I wouldn´t say no to a 3 player game. With 4 players I begin to feel the downtime and the play time grows a lot. I don’t think I will be playing with 4 again. In many games I have made mistakes that leave me out of the game, it is very unforgiving, I love it as does my SO :D.

I will buy it soon.

I now have 6 completed plays and another 3 in progress on Boite a jeux. 

My opinion is revised slightly from before. Getting a nurse as soon as possible is very important. However, going beyond this 4th nurse is not always needed. There are two main VP sources to consider: 1) objectives which require more nurses 2) sub-colonies and large pheromone tiles which can be done with fewer nurses.

I think they decided to start you with 3 nurses for a good reason, which is to balance these two sources of VP. If you start with 4 nurses then you can easily get a 5th right away and the objective strategy starts to outshine the sub-colonies. Or worse yet, everything becomes possible.

I am really enjoying this game but it takes a lot of planning, cube counting both of your own position and your opponents'. With enough experience this can be mitigated, I think 90-120 minutes for 4p is definitely realistic. The game is shorter, and excellent as a two player as well.

=====================================================
After one play with 4 I have some concerns but I also really enjoyed the game. 

The good:
It was engaging and there was lots to think about. You have to carefully plan your actions and there are never enough nurses to do everything you want. The very solitaire player board where you allocate nurses is offset nicely by the garden phase where you compete for resources with your opponents.

The bad:
-I can't imagine not focusing on more nurses on round one. I don't think any other action could really be worth it. You also want to hold on to nurses for as long as possible until you finally cash them out for objective cards. I think this basic strategy is unavoidable, and while you can focus on different things during the game you do get a sense that some of your decisions are very scripted. 
-It was loooonng :(  Three hours for our game. If future plays don't see a dramatic drop in play time I will loose all interest in this game. There simply isn't enough going on to justify this length. Although I did very much enjoy this first game I was also learning the system and the novelty made the three hours interesting and fun. In the future this length will be crippling, especially if the first point of scripted actions is true.

I dig this game.  (Get it?)  I love the interaction between the player boards (colonies) and the surface play.  The worker placement/resource management mechanics are easily graspable for an experienced gamer -- nothing terribly new there -- but it works very well.  
The surface play is clever and has enough potential for interaction that, I think, could give you very different games depending on how aggressive people want to play it...

Probably my fave out of BGG 2012.

I think this is a very "good" game. Sadly, it was one that was painful for me to play. There are those games that make you feel as if you are doing well and scoring tons of points and then there are those games (like Agricola) that make you feel as if there is never enough of what you need. This is one of those in the latter category. It was a little bit of a arduous experience for me. I am willing to try it again and expect it to get significantly better on the second play. Try before you buy!

While Myrmes is a well-designed game, it's too strategic, i.e. too much long-term engine-building for my liking. It is a pet peeve of mine but it always troubles me when there are certain things you have to do in building up your engine if you want to have success. Here, it seems to be a must to clear out additional levels in your hive early and also to place special tiles on the board to generate resources throughout the game. Don't get me wrong, there are enough other things to consider like the objectives to make this a game worth playing. It's just one of these titles where my subjective enjoyment stays behind it's objective strengths. The awful although usual design of Ystari for the board and tiles doesn't help here.

The first impression after reading the rules was: wow! A lot of very fiddly rules... But using the information, provided on the game board and player boards everything gets clear after some time. It is hard to see all the ways to victory from reading the rules or even from several first plays, but I hope the game will reveal itself after some more plays.

Pirmasis įspūdis perskaičius taisykles buvo: oho! Daug painių taisyklių. Kaip ten bebūtų, naudojantis informacija pateikta ant pagrindinės žaidimo lentos ir žaidėjų lentų, greitai viskas išaiškėja.

Was really excited for this one. The board art was beautiful, the idea of the ant theme was charming, and the use of pheromones was a clever idea. In actual play, I didn't enjoy it at all. The rules were poorly written, though I can forgive a game for that if the play is fun. In this game, you always feel pinched by the food requirement in combination with the resource limit. At the beginning, you only have four spaces for resources and you are told you must have four food to feed your colony by the end of the season. You have to "buy" levels to unlock a resource capacity increase of two measly extra spaces. And you do this with...? Resources! High-cost resources you can't hold onto because of the limit. It feels psychologically draining to constantly lose goods you have worked so hard to gather just because of an arbitrary limit. Also, it's depressing to see your ants die upon completing any kind of action. Bonus points can only be obtained by paying an outrageously high resource cost and then PERMANENTLY sacrificing your most useful ants. If you really enjoy Stone Age, you will probably dislike playing Myrmes.

Just one learning game so far.  Enjoyable game, and one that will reward experience.  For me, the theme is only slightly better than average.  Tuning up your efficiencies seems to be the order of the day.  If I played more of it, my enthusiasm might kindle.  But for now, its a "play if requested" sort of game.

The thing that sort of sticks out interfering with my warming to this game, is that all routes to victory have likely been well trod down.  I don't think I will be able to do anything unexpected in this game.  I might be wrong, as I haven't played it enough to know.  But I feel like every decision I might make has been thoroughly explored by the design team, a la 7 Wonders, and there is no game space left for me to explore.

After the initial play, I'm rating this one a 10! It's got all the components I love in a strategy game, plus this one really forces you to choose how you balance your workers (nurses) and point strategy. It looks like there will be a lot of replayability with this game too, as there are many strategies for points, and many different bonus objective combinations. The concept is neat too!

Big thematic game that utilizes worker placement and area control to decent effect. Players are in charge of an ant colony over 3 years, with each year including all 4 different seasons. Players give their ants' nurses directives to allow them to take different actions during the course of the game to score victory points. All said the game is interesting, and thematically appealing, but doesn't provide anything new to the table and ends up falling flat because of it. Without games similar to this I could see the rating being much higher, but as is a day late and a few dollars short.

08-07-2014 - This game is so hard!  It's a perfectly infuriating resource management / worker placement with feeding your workers and everything else we love to hate in these games.  Well, hate is a strong word for sure, but I didn't "feel" this one as much as I'd hoped I would.  If I want a headache I'll bang my head in a wall.  (did I just say I'd rather bang my head in a wall than play this?)  It's really not bad.  It's very well designed, very pretty to look at, and plays well.  But it is what it is, and that's "difficult" (to do well) (IMHO).

RATING: 7
Very unique worker placement game. The goal is to expand your ant colony while collecting resources and food to make it through the seasons. There is no conflict with other players except for laying pheromone trails to block other players.  The instructions are pretty good and thorough. The symbology can get a little confusing but it begins to make sense as you play.

Un gran eurogame donde gestionas un hormiguero, precioso y con un tema muy molón.
Planificación pura y dura de tus acciones, es MUY importante tener en cuenta los eventos y objetivos que salen en cada partida, esto le da una rejugabilidad enorme y cada partida es un mundo. Además la interacción entre los jugadores para poner las feromonas y saber obtener puntos limpiando las feromonas de los demás es una lucha continua por todos los frentes.
Otra cosa que me encanta es el orden de turno en la partida, todo puede cambiar, sobretodo a 4 jugadores, si eres el primero o el último en jugar.
No le pongo más nota por la curva de aprendizaje que tiene y porque peca de bastante AP.
Una maravilla como juego.

In Myrmes, originally shown under the name ANTerpryse, players control ant colonies and use their ants to explore the land (leaving pheromones in their wake); harvest "crops" like stone, earth and aphids; fight with other ants; complete requests from the Queen; birth new ants; and otherwise dominate their tiny patch of dirt, all in a quest to score points and prove that they belong at the top of the heap, er, anthill. After three seasons of scrabbling and foraging, each ant colony faces a harsh winter that will test its colonial strength.

Heavily flavoured worker-placement game. It's gorgeous, all the components (It's a pity some of the special tiles came with printing errors).

The game combines an administrative "single-player" experience in the ant-colony board, with a VERY competitive area domination strategy on the garden board. I find this interesting! Although you should know that the area control is very important and you cannot ignore this path to get points. Feeding your colony is also crucial.

The things I don't like are mainly the fact that pieces are really small, and the set-up is quite annoying. Also the rules could be better written, I had to look around the BGG for a couple of days until I got everything right.

One three player game.  Two good players and me (playing bad, very bad - The Washington Generals would be embarrassed for me).

From a bad player's perspective the game has an internal logic that works well with the theme and in overall terms is easy to understand (worker ant placement and territory management game).  You may however on a first play get lost in the detail at the start and the placement of your nurses / ants may not be clear at the start.  This is a problem because Myrmes is a middle to heavyweight game that isn't too forgiving to mistakes and some errors may haunt you throughout the game.  Most of the game I was making noises of despair as I never seemed to have enough resources because of a tactically naïve move in the early rounds.

However, the two better players were being challenged and pained noises were also coming from their corners.  This is definitely a game that challenges all levels, asks you to make decisions at each point and appears to have several routes to victory which require flexibility to respond to the developing situation.  A pre-determined plan may only get you so far.  Ultimately, success can be based on quick intelligent responses to small details.

One small point is that the game might benefit from player screens.  For the good players to hide their nurse placement and for players like me to hide their head in shame.

Much heavier than I was expecting yet as short as I wanted it to be. It's still not quite the "Antiquity Light" that some elluded to, but I'm actually glad for that. For sure there's the constant cycling economy, only tenuously comparible to Antiquity, but the other elements simply don't match up to much else. 

One thing is for sure, this game is not only thematic but it beats the pants off the last attempt at making an Ant colony game.

This is kind of a stopgap game for something like Antics which is impossible to get hold of until your rich uncle dies and leaves his wealth to you. There is a lot of tight control going on here and it can be easy to put yourself behind and sort of difficult to get yourself back up. As usual  with these kinds of games you have a very limited amount of time to do everything in but that is part of what makes them interesting.

1.Game with rules problem?
2.Agree the opinion of Edward Chow:
Myrmes，sim-ants，失望，失望不在於機制而在於主題。操作自家圖版，提升能力，再在大版圖上build up王國，資源好tight，過程中有不少tough decision，需要好精準計算，蟻穴空間有限，不能保留太多資源；感覺上玩家之間做的東西太似，各自沒有特別能力，而又同時向同一些目標進發，看看誰最有效率跑得快。主題上滿是期待的，可惜實際上，很多操作都難以解釋，說明書上亦不似co2，未有解說操作背後的story。例如每季節有event發生，可以消耗蟻蛋改變event，莫名奇妙；蟻蛋只會變成「nurse」，工蟻兵蟻不是由蟻蛋轉換，而「nurse」卻可直接生產工蟻兵蟻不經蟻蛋階段，而所謂「nurse」係萬能worker，起洞升級或生其他「nurse」也可以；遊戲沒有蟻后，蟻后默默地在背後放出mission tile, 做到有大VP scoring；自家版圖有數個蟻穴以路徑相連，以為同螞蟻生態有關，其實係冇乜關；以為玩這個遊戲會學到有關螞蟻的豐富資訊，結果冇；最最最嚴重係，隻螞蟻figure似蜘蛛多過似螞蟻！

Very tight game. Also very unusual for Ystari to have a gem with such a strong theme.

Myrmes is a decent game combining several mechanics including worker placement, resource building, and area control. The beginning of the game is very slow and limited as all players do the same thing. They'll work to get another worker and level up their tech after killing a few insects. The end of the game is also painful as most of the last turn is spent working to produce 6 food. The theme however is very well integrated into the game unlime most games of the genre, even the most popular ones.

Very nicely designed worker placement game. Theme is very original, and quite present. These plastic ants really make a difference :-)
The game itself it quite complicated, and good upfront strategy planning is really necessary to avoid being stuck during the game. Plan your actions at the right time in the right order ! 

I need a few more plays to master this game, but first impression was, good game, although, it was a bit slow with 4 players. That has everything to do with the enormous ahead planning you need to do and the big number of options you have each turn. Too much downtown is thus my most serious complain about this game. So don't play this with people that prefer to sacrifice game fun for victory security ;-)

Myrmes makes my head hurt. It's a good hurt, ... kind of. It does take a lot out of me to play but I'm unsure if there's enough "fun" ROI for that effort as I find in other games.

Mechanically, the game is really well designed. Everything is tight and there are strategic and tactical decisions that must be made on every turn. Some of the components could use an upgrade (e.g start player token, prey, and score markers) but the ants are great!

I like it but it borders on work. Trade interest medium to low.

This is one tight game! You have to plan your whole game of three years in broad terms on turn one of year one, then execute the three turns of each of the three years in accordance with a medium turn plan. And then you have to cope with what the other players do. 

This is another of those games that I really like, but at which I am shit. It is also a game that I could never take to my Friday game group. So, although I own a copy, I will probably only ever play online. Shame really, 'cos it's an excellent game.

13/11/2012:  Reasonably heavy game, bit of a learning curve.  Not so friendly for new players.

Reminded me of Castles of Burgundy, with many paths to victory although less dice and a better theme.  A good game, but probably not one for my collection.

But could be a decent option for someone wanting a heavy euro with a regular group, and would play much faster with experience.

Interesting take on worker placement. Can use workers in a variety of ways and can even gain and lose some. Enough variability and strategic options to make it replayable as well. Scales well for 2-4 players. Good artwork and components. Nice theme and it is not just pasted on. 

Enough interaction to keep it from being multi-player solitaire, but no you can't actually fight ants. Can't really bash the leader but as always still wish scores were hidden.

Worker placement on your player board, area control and conflict on the main board. So resource and action tight, there are a lot of options but few ways to gain or make them happen.

Update after the second play: We all did better this time. It is an unforgiving game in which you need to plan right for what you can do in the next season. We all got our planning better now. This allowed for much more interaction, as we could build more, capture tiles etc. Good game.

Two plays. Resource management with actions on your own board as well as on the central board. Lots of planning, quite heavy in the first play to get it all right. Quite solitary play too. So it is solid, I like it, but it is not as great as I expected. I also think that interplay variability will be limited. It is just the available goals that will change. So it may become a bit samey after a few plays, for now it is still solid and challenging. Rating will be adjusted after more plays.

Only played once, hoping to upgrade the rating after more plays. This is one of those games that is so tight and there are so many things to do that you set out to achieve nine things and actually only finish three.

Confirmed after second play. There is a lot to learn in order to properly manage priorities.

My showing improved significantly on the third play. There is a certain short-term engine that must be built in this game that ramps up fast enough to power expansion (of all kinds) but that does not peter out a turn or two short of end-game. It needs to be moderated, as a high peak just leaves you with extra resources to discard one turn and an empty harvest the next. But if you move too slowly there won't be any territory to lay your tiles and increase your income. Tricky!

Variation comes from both the bonus randomization of each season and especially the actions of your opponents "above ground" where the direct player interaction takes place.

Great game.

Myrmes is a game that offers the same depth and strategy as classics like Caylus. The limited options, several scoring methods, the timing aspects and meaningful decisions are all blended together in a great game. No luck (only initial board set-up) and open information can make this game prone to AP but the high player interaction assure that your strategy needs to be robust to counter the actions of other players.

Deceptively easy to learn. This is pure eurogame madness. Very tight board, many options available to you at all times, and all/none of them are adequate. You'll spend a whole game hating yourself because you could've made one more point if you had played something just a liiiiittttle differently. Scales very well between 2 to 4 players.

OK, so the first round or two may be somewhat scripted, but there are always plenty of options and considerations to make. Some of them depend on what your opponents are doing, so you have to adapt, and can't stick to any pre-conceived plans for long. Can be very competitive. Only 9 rounds, so every move counts. The game is unforgiving that way. Some randomizers ensure that each game is different.
I've raised this from a 9 to a 10 after several plays.

This game is very different in both theme and how the mechanics mesh together.
Despite the intuitive iconography on both the player boards and main board, it takes a game before you really understand how all the parts of the game fit together. But when you have grasped this, then the game is very quick and smooth.
It is the difference to other games that make it stand out for me, and I am really looking forward to future games.

After 4 plays, I am starting to think that this could be one of my all time favourite games. I have yet to win a game, but it is sooooooo enjoyable to play!

Myrmes has an interesting theme, and the mechanisms all seem to work pretty well, but the game just isn't that fun.

RATING: 8
Myrmes is a clever but very unforgiving "eurosimulation" of an ant colony. Use your never enough nurses (action points) to raise worker ants (for area control/resource production), raise soldier ants (to remove enemies/opponents) or improve the colony (build an economic engine). It's stressful in the beginning but somewhat pleasing when your planning "clicks". My main concern with Myrmes is that it's actions rather than resources that are scarce, resulting in a game where you're more focused on your own gameplay rather than interacting with the other players.

I've tried playing it once but we ran out of time. It's a worker placement game, but unlike Agricola, this one is VERY tough to explain due to the many complicated phases that must be learned right away. Each turn has like 7 phases to keep track of. However, once you get past that initial obstacle it doesn't seem that hard to play. I'd like to try it again.

The first few moves of the game is bsically scripted, and I can't really say further moves are really that divergent. 

The game is fine, the different scoring areas are balanced and the level of thinking required is not pointless. The unusual theme and the need of planning based on your location (in a board full of obstacles) is one of the greatest strength of the game. However, despite the goal cards changing every game, I don't think the game is replayable enough. A good once-in-a-while experience, however.

In this ant colony game, players use their nurses to produce soldier ants, worker ants, produce larvae, or get more nurses. Workers go out to spread phermones to give you resource cubes and easier access to food. Nurses can also help you increase your technology level or gain VPs. So it's a worker placement game, with a preset map where you move your ants to gain food.

I've only played once. It's got nice components, and there is some strategy, but I need a few more games under my belt. It's a decent game, but not outstanding either.

Good game, but not great. 

What I like: there is replayability, due to the objectives, the seasons dice and the choices of the players; there is also very little luck; there is interactions between players (even if limited to the shared board). 

What I don't like is that the choices are too few, somehow the game doesn't allow a personal creative play, what I am searching in great games.

D'you remember the ending of A Bug's Life when the grasshoppers invaded the ant colony and killed all 4 of the ants? No?! That's not how it ended? You mean to tell me that there were so many ants that they outnumbered and defeated the bigger grasshoppers? Well, that can't be right. According to Myrmes, ant colonies only have a few ants, so that movie lied to you and all children.

When I think of ants, the first thing that comes to mind is their population. Despite all the things Myrmes does to remain thematic, the endless struggle to have any ants at all in your colony was a major disconnect for me.

If I wanted to play a 'turn the crank until victory points come out' game, I would choose Terra Mystica over Myrmes every time.

I would like to play this game again as the first time we played it took quite a long time.  A friend that had bought the game does not read rules or prepare himself for a first game in any way what so ever.  He says it is because he wants everyone to learn at the same time so that there are no discrepancies in the rules.  Not only did our OTHER friend end up teaching us, but there were TONS of rules discrepancies.  

I actually do not remember much about the game play at this point as this is a few months afterwards a quite confusing play, but even with all the irritation I guess I enjoyed the game because I came on here and gave it an 8.  

I will have to play this game again sometime.

Solid worker placement set in an ant colony simulation.

Economic worker placement game with a great, great theme, that completely pervades the whole game. It is very unforgiving: you will pay for your mistakes.

I had some concerns about the interactivity of the game being able to destroy the planning, but even if it can thwart your plans, it is not that powerful.

I expected a very good game, with some reservations, but after playing it I found a great game, with no reservations.

There is some degree of variable elements, but they are not that important and I think its replayability will not be great. I see some strategies being carried from game to game (not always).

Ambientazione singolare per questo gioco di pura programmazione. Ogni giocatore dovrà espandere e far crescere il proprio formichiere per poter garantirne la sopravvivenza nei prossimi tre anni. Le dinamiche del gioco non sono immediate ma il tutto risulta abbastanza ambientato e i materiali (le formichine) sono simapatici. L'interazione è presente ma non influisce in maniera determinante. Gioco molto strategico ma un po' ripetitivo anche se il lancio dei dadi potrebbe imporre strategie differenti a seconda delle partite.

RATING: 6.8
Interesting, thematically cool and featuring great art. 

Unfortunately, there are a few downsides (which, frankly, the discerning gamer could pick out from a mile away knowing the publisher). A horrible learning curve means you'll essentially learn by making mistakes and it's very easy to put yourself out of contention early on (or even be put out by someone else). A cast-off effect is that it is ghastly to teach and doesn't encourage new players: bad news for a lot of regular groups. The level of planning is reminiscent of Caylus and will induce the same sort of headaches. There is a nagging feeling that most games will ultimately spin out more or less the same way. I'd play again, but it might be painful to do so too often...

This game is great. I love the contrast between the dynamic competitive board and the sheltered personal colony. I love the way a player has to really think carefully about his next few moves. I also love the way the theme and mechanics are integrated so seamlessly. If I have one tiny complaint, it is the quality of the components. (The rulebook was not well laid out, the personal boards are flimsy, and most components are at the level of "functional".) The little ants are cool though.

The best ant game I've ever played. Not a high bar to jump over, but with that ringing endorsement reverberating around your ears, I'll dessert it up with the view that this is pretty good. There's a lot of rules, but once you have a game under your belt, the game flows nicely and the player aid does actually incorporate them nicely (it's just displayed in too abstruse a manner during the first play is all). Basically it's choose how you'd like to accumulate your points and direct your nurses (your individual worker placement units) to either develop workers (for developing the main board), soldiers (to plunder the main board), invest more in your engine or accumulate objective points at the sacrifice of a nurse. All of which usually require resources which can be done by harvesting, plundering or staying at home. Things get both easier and harder as the game goes by as the board develops and tightens (and that's your interaction with the other players as otherwise it's a bit sandboxy, which I don't mind). Hard decisions have to be made each turn about how to develop / plunder / invest next. I like how the seasons provide a different bonus each turn, and I like the decision on whether to either accept that bonus or spend stuff to get a bonus to either side of the free bonus instead. It provides another input into your planning - free stuff is always good. There are some compulsory food checkpoints through the game which you need to cater for. There seems to be very little downtime as everyone plans together, and then activating the workers is quick. Decisions and planning can be hard and can likely require some time once you really get into it, so you wouldn't want to play with AP'ers. Length seems right. Theme is great. Components are nice. I'm concerned that the game might feel same-y from play to play given the board is fixed, the engine development similar, with the only variation being what free bonuses will be collected in what order. Maybe that's all that's required to give different pathways each game. I look forward to exploring more to find out.

A very odd game where you control ants that have to journey out of the home and collect resources in order to feed at the end of each season. The mechanics of creating workers or fighters and then going out onto the board is quite original and after a few plays you really start to see the brilliance of the game and how tight it is. You must plan well, especially based on the turns event (based on a die roll) and the objectives set at the start of the game. A great Euro.

This is a worker-placement game based on building up an ant colony.  Each player has a player board representing the colony, with "entrances" on the main board from which you can send ants to gather resources.  You can use your nurse ants to improve your player board or get more other types of ants, but you must use your worker ants to actually get more resources.  The workers can either be used on the player board to get a small amount of resources (more if you improve it) or outside to get more resources, but if you go outside the worker is lost.  There is a ton of planning in this game, as everything has a certain order, and you can see what's coming several turns in advance.  That aspect reminds me a little of Age of Steam, though the mechanisms are very different.  I loved this game, and endorse it as a great game for lovers of planning, but it might be a little prone to AP for just that reason.

I'm really liking this. It feels like Antiquity junior in the sense that a player has to manage his own ant colony while competing for space on the common board. 

It seems quite unforgiving. Many phases are played simultaneously, so the downtime isn't as bad as it otherwise might be in a brain-burner like this.

I was initially worried about re-playability, but so far the goal tiles and random insect set-up have kept things quite interesting (3 plays).

The game has an appealing theme and nice artwork.  On our first few plays (2 players) it seemed like the three "years" of game play didn't give me quite enough time to execute my strategies. With additional play the game space seemed to expand a bit. Rating may go up with subsequent plays as my understanding of the strategies improves. 

Edit: The dice for each season really change up the tightness of the resources quite a bit. Getting the special tiles out early can really improve your game.

(1 play)  Here we have another well-themed designer game with amazing components and a carefully scripted engine.  It's another worker placement building game, this time the operational characteristics of an ant colony.  6 phases, 4 seasons, 3 years - of moving cubes and cylinders from hither to thither and back.

I could make some vague comparisons to Agricola, or other worker placement games that require one of a few carefully executed early game scripts to build your engine into a more productive (but more varied) end game - running your engine (ant colony).

For me, the sheer number of steps to execute, and transactions to perform get in the way of being able to enjoy the game.  The game is a lot of work.  For those willing to learn the engine and put a few plays in, I'll bet there's a decent payoff.  It just won't happen for me.

This is a classic of seemingly being able to do so little, yet ultimately doing so much.  Every action is a sacrifice, every gain also the painful release of a variety of other possibilities.  So constrained, yet so flexible.  A paradox of gameplay.  The map provides wonderful interaction and convincing territorial struggle.  Encroaching on other's territory is a necessity, a constant back and forth.  So many narrow tight-rope paths to choose from, and such great payoff.  Somehow I got that colony advancement!  And also made some soldiers to protect my food?  And nurses to sacrifice to the larger colony goals!  How can I do all this?  And it ends so swiftly, I have no idea how it all worked out.  Or didn't.  Because if you screw up, you are lost.  But don't worry.  There is always next game.

I can't help but feel this is kind of what it's like to be an ant.

This is an ok game about ants. In general, it's a worker placement game, but in about half the available actions, your worker is spent and doesn't return to you, so you have to spend more actions to create more. The achievement system is where most of the points come from, and those give many more points to players who get there first, which can make it difficult to unseat the points leader. Because workers are so scarce, this game can also really punish you for making a mistake, especially early on. I like it, but I don't love it.

Complicated as hell to teach, but very satisfying once you get the hang of things.  Genuinely feels like you're "running" an ant colony; the theme is pervasive, well implemented, and enhances the experience considerably.  Some complaints, besides the aforementioned complexity, is that it pretty much can only be played with four players, the components have some questionable elements (the tiny ants are cool, but I feel like losing one would basically make a 50 dollar game worthless), and there is no variability in the board itself, so there could be some sameness with multiple plays.
I enjoy it, regardless.  It's a heavy Euro, make no mistake, but if that's your bag, give it a try for something unique and, ultimately, quite fun.

Nothing new in this game but it is very well done. The theme is great and so is the tension of feeding the colony and competing for territory. The only negative is that the rulebook is a bit vague around turn progression.

Theme  is not very interesting.   I like the concept of a double layer of worker placement but the low number of workers to begin with and to do anything you lose workers seems like the mechanism is wasted.  You don't build up much of an engine to satisfy.  I like the dice mechanism for the upcoming seasons (rounds) so you can do some forward planning.

Very tight on resources, every action is filled with opportunity costs. Game is thematic, with multiple ways of scoring points.

Enjoyed the theme - building up an ant colony, the tiny ant pieces are nice. It seems to be another worker placement feed your people and collect resources to convert to other resources to eventually convert into points. The workers can stay in the colony for small amounts of resources or venture outside to get more resources at the cost of a worker. So there is a lot of advanced planning since you have to claim spots on the board.
Enjoyable exercise but I don't need to own a copy.

Myrmes is a very thematic eurogame, with deep gameplay and also very short on actions. For some reason is very hard to bring to the table.
Classic Euro feel, plays quickly, scales OK and very well balanced.

This game has a great mix of working placement with two different type workers.  There is a press your luck aspect when to go for areas on the surface and when going for objectives.  The resource management seems tight and you really need to get an engine going.  Just a lot going on in this relatively easy to understand game but complex with respect to game play. This is one of those type games that I recently have shied away from becuase of AP down time but this one for some reason doesn't feel like down time and is really fun to build your colony and watch it grow.  Really like this one and looking forward to delving deeper into the game play.

RATING: 7.4
(+) Original theme which blends well with the mechanics

(+) Nice and colorful components (except for the point/year track markers)

(+) Some interesting engine building aspects combined with an action point system. Except for the goals, this is rather an action point driven system rather than a typical worker placement game (there is very little competition for action spots as most of them are unlimited or personal).

(+) Interesting tile placement mechanism going on when placing fermone tiles (determins harvest of resources, point scoring abilities related to your technology level, interaction on the map with other players, ...)

(+) Clever management of resources, different types of workers, ...

(+) The game is easy to explain and it plays really quickly given the amount of choices it offers

(+) Different types of goals each game, so different strategies to score points will be feasible.

(+) Solid planning is key in this game. This is a really strategic game.

(-) The game is a little too short to feel like you are being awarded for building up a nice engine

(-) When playing you are short on everything: little on storage capacity, little resources, little number of different workers, very few turns, ... This is quite unthematic (an ant colony containing a maximum of 8 workers/soldiers?) and actually kind of draws the overall theme down somewhat. It turns a game which could have felt epic in its possibilities to grow your colony into a powerful machine into something which remains rather short, small with a sole strict focus on planning sparingly. It is a really good game in which careful planning will get you to win and it does offer you some interesting paths to do some engine building, but it won't give you a rewarding feeling of a growing colony - for that reason, despite the fact that I really really like this game, it doesn't make it to my absolute top favorite list.

[u]Tips:[/u]
(*) Investing in food and larvae in the first half of the game in order to obtain extra nurses is a good idea. Investing in the colony (nurses and level updates) in the first 5 turns and turning this into points in the final 4 rounds is a good way of scoring.
(*) Keep an eye out for opponents with large fermone tiles within your reach without any cubes on them. If you can clean them up with (one or more) soldier(s) and replace a large tile with one of your own, this can generate a lot of points
(*) The goal scoring tiles are important to score. However, don't go there too early - it is often better to wait until the final 4-5 rounds to go there because this action will cost you a valuable nurse - don't let the 3 points for your oppenents for you going there late detract you too much from this.
(*) Having soldiers at the end of the season is important: they count as food cubes which don't perish during winter and those food cubes don't count against your stock limit. With 3 nurses you can create 2 soldiers easily, which is quite a good deal.

This was probably my biggest disappointment so far of the games I was anticipating from Essen.  The mechanics for building different workers, and manipulating the season bonus to best effect, is fun, but what's going on on the board - laying down pheromone tiles, hunting insects, clearing out opponents' tiles - is just not that fun, and the achievement goals to get extra points is just totally tacked on with no attempt at any theme.  I do like that this is a Euro where the designer clearly tried to start with the theme and then build a game from there, but it just seems to me they failed to design anything fun for you to do with your ant colony.

RATING: 7
This is a really fun game.  It is really unforgiving and a little cutthroat. It is an area control game mixed with a worker placement aspect. The board and components are beautiful. It does have some icons that you need to interpret because the game does not have any text. This game has one of the harshest requirements to feed your colony(workers) that I have seen in a game.  For that reason I could not get my game group to even give it a try. For me, I like the challenge, but some people really do not like that aspect. I was Sad to let it go but there was no use holding onto it, if it was not going to get played.

My type of game: heavier, strategic & highly thematic euro pleasant to the eye. Requires planning 3 turns ahead in considerable detail and having an idea for strategy for future turns. Many ways to gain points, but it's always directly connected to advancing your colony and happens a bit as a side effect, it doesn't require you to calculate the payout for every possible move for efficient play like Terra Mystica does for example, which is a big plus. No luck element with randomness being limited do the placement of different bugs (preys) on the lawn, 6 objectives which can score you points and events (bonuses for particular actions) drawn for next year (three turns), all of which are common for all players. It isn't much, and while it makes some choices slightly more profitable than others, it's certainly not enough to railroad you to a particular strategy. There aren't many of those anyway, and games tend to be quite similar to each other. The randomness is enough to eliminate scripted openings, but there definitely is a pattern to your actions, at least in the first (of three) year. This isn't necessarily wrong, but if you want a game which feels differently every time and with many strategies worth pursuing, this isn't it. The interaction is also on the lower side, virtually non-existent in early game, and experienced as being blocked out of some turf a couple of times later on - nothing drastic. Overall I like it for the pleasant and thematic brain-burning it provides, but I don't feel as much tension here as I find in some other (more interactive? Less schematic?) euros.

A good example of the best the eurogame genre has to offer. Myrmes succeeds remarkably well in pulling off its theme. Playing the game very much feels like managing the comings and goings of an ant colony. It is, however, a "tight" game that rewards long-term planning and punishes a fly-by-your-pants approach. Because of this it is not going to be everyone's cup of tea.

I appreciate the mix of worker placement like action selection and area control. All of the systems work well together, and the goals and bonuses add a bit of variety.

It's a challenging game to play well, play mistakes are often extremely costly, and it can be a bit stressful, which occasionally bothers me a little bit. 

I would like a bit more variety, but overall it is a very well designed game.

Misprinted tiles and a confusing rulebook. Once you get over these things, the game is mediocre at best. Never have I had to flip through a rulebook so much when playing a game. I will continue to play this and familiarize (clarify in some cases) myself with more rules, but I have the feeling that there are other Euros that my brainpower will be used developing strategy rather than recalling rules.

Also, the simultaneous actions in some placement rounds just doesn't work. I watch the other players place their nurses as I place mine. House rules to clear this up lengthen the game. 

Just paid money for reprinted tiles. The game didn't improve at all. Downgraded rating from a 4 to a 3.

Played once with 3P. Despite a little fumbling through the rules, this is a solid and decent Euro. The theme is unique and strangely appropriate, although there is little interaction apart from some blocking to get objectives and to claim turfs. As there is little interaction, and all the random elements (i.e. the dice rolls) are decided at the start of the year, the game has a very puzzle-like feel in deciding how you want to optimise your moves for the year.

Tipikus Ystari. Jól összerakott, jópár érdekes elem, eredetiség és többféle út, de nem egy éppen kedvelt téma. Hangyakolóniát irányítanak a játékosok, amiben 3 szerepet alakíthatnak a hangyáink. Nevelők, munkások és harcosok, bár a nevelők kicsit mások azért. Vannak lárváink, akik tulajdonképpen egy anyagot testesítenek meg a föld, kő és étel mellett negyedikként. Mindenki saját kis tábláján menedzseli a kolóniáját, a nagy táblán pedig feromonok segítségével tudunk nyersanyagokat begyűjteni a környező zöld területekről. Emellett harcosaink itt tudnak különböző bogarakra vadászni, illetve egymás feromonjait megszerezni. Már az első fázis is érdekes, mert a 3 évből álló játék 4 évszakában 3-ban kapunk valami segítséget és ez kockákkal dől el. Ezen segítségeket meg tudjuk változtatni lárváink segítségével. Ez a rész is már elég változatosságot ad annak, hogy ne legyen két egyforma parti. Második fázisban nevelőinket tudjuk munkáslehelyezős formában munkára fogni. Katonát vagy munkást vagy lárvákát nevelnek, esetleg valamilyen akció végrehajtására foghatjuk be őket. Munkásaink ezután vagy a bolyban dolgoznak vagy a kertben mászkálnak feromonokat hátrahagyva vagy katonáinkkal vadásznak. A téli évszakban etetnünk kell, ami nem könnyű dolog és szép mínusz pontok járnak ha nem tudunk megfelelni a kívánt mennyiség elérésének. Érdekesek a küldetések, amiket én túl erősnek éreztem, de jól mutatja a játék többutas voltát, hogy simán nyerhetett volna az a játékos, aki egyetlen küldetést sem csinált meg. A konfrontáció is teljesen jól meg lett oldva, ugyanis nagy kárt nem igazán lehet okozni az ellenfélnek, de pontokat rendesen lehet ebből gyűjteni. Jól kitalált, jól működő játék a Myrmes és mai másolós korszakban nekem üdítő volt. Nem kiemelkedő, de ugyanolyan jó kis játék, mint a legtöbb Y-os.

Solid Euro worker placement game.  

I like the map and how the game interacts with the environment.  But ultimately there is way too much perfect information logistics that the planning just gets tiring after a while.  You really could plot out most of your game at the first sitting.  The result is that you end up systematically plowing through the directive that you set for yourself, making occasional minor corrections in case your land gets encroached on or in case you think someone might beat you to the punch on the VP tiles.

I tend to like perfect information games, but there is just too little interaction between players for this to be that interesting.  Did it really need to be three years?  Why not start us on year 2?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Its an interesting game, but quite punishing and needs a particular strategy or play style to play it properly and take advantage of all the options.

Resources are very limited though and I can't help feeling this game would be better with either an extra year; or to play Winter as per the other seasons but also with a food wipe.

Considering its perceived complexity (there's a lot to remember, but it comes together fairly easy) it is actually quite a quick game. 

Good worker placement games have that element of 'There's never quite just enough of a resource to achieve something'. But in Myrmes you never even seem close - the resource storage area is woefully small and most of your hard work collecting food is wiped at the end of the year. Everything (eg objectives, killing the harder prey, building nurses) is expensive. There is plenty of stuff to do, but it's just so hard getting enough resources to do almost anything.

RATING: 8
REALLY hard to learn this online in PBW format, but actually it's a pretty simple (rule-wise) game. And it's really really good! It is a worker-placement game with a nice mix of tactical play (each turn, turn order matters; you have to take advantage of the current event die and board position before other players screw it up for you) and strategic play (you see all events for the entire year at the start of each year; and must plan towards the large-VP Objective tiles, visible at the start of the game, from near the beginning of the game (they are difficult to achieve and direct play in different directions).

--- Summary ---
[b]Setup[/b]
[u]Board[/u]
- Depending on player count (2-4), cordon off parts of the board as indicated
- Players place their starting ant hill tunnel exits in designated places on the board, and VP marker on the 10-space
- Place random prey tiles (ladybug, termite, spider) on the board in the indicated spaces.
- Choose 6 random objective tiles (2 each from levels 1-3) and place in display on the board. 
[u]Players[/u]
- Players each place 1 larva cube, 2 worker ants, and 3 nurses on their personal boards, as well as a marker for the tech tree (level 0). 
- Random player gets Start Player marker.

[b]Game Flow[/b]
There are 3 years in the game, each with 4 rounds/seasons. Each year, roll an event die for the first 3 seasons (spring, summer, fall); winter has no event. The events modify each of the available actions in the game (move further, harvest more, place larger pheromone tiles, etc.).

[u]Step 1[/u]
Players simultaneously allocate their nurses on their personal boards. They may also spend larvae to adjust the event die (for themselves only) -- result displayed on personal player board. Nurse locations on player boards cost 1-2 nurses and will earn you varying things based on location and number of nurses spent:
- make more larvae (white cubes); at any time on your turn, may convert larvae:food at 3:1
- make soldier(s)
- make more worker ant(s)
- Atelier: see below
Then, everyone simultaneously earns whatever larvae, armies, and workers they're due according to their placements (limited by tokens supplied in game).

[u]Step 2[/u]
In turn order, until all worker ants are used, players use ONE of their available worker ants. Workers may earn a resource cube on their tech tree OR pop out of an ant hole tunnel exit onto the board; that ant may:
- move up to 3 hexes. If on a pheromone tile
... must spend 1 soldier to go onto another player's tile (unowned tiles do not cost a soldier)
... may move to any space on that tile for free
... if it is empty, may spend earth to remove from game (earn VP shown on tile).
- During move, may kill prey you land on by spending 1 or 2 soldiers; earn food cubes and/or VP
- May replace your ant with one pheromone tile (max size based on your current tech level and available space on board) or special tile (based on tech level). Place food/earth/stone cube(s) on the pheromone tile according to the terrain you are covering. Earn VP shown on tile.
- Your ant is returned to Supply.

[u]Step 3[/u]
Next, players harvest one cube from each of their tiles: place in storage (on player board). Resource cubes are _not_ meant to be supply-limited.

[u]Step 4[/u]
Then, in turn order until all nurses are used, players use ONE of the nurses in their Atelier. Each of a player's nurses must take a different action (multiple players may choose the same action):
- place new ant hill tunnel on board, adjacent to one of your tiles already on the board. Earn 1 earth cube.
- gain ONE new nurse: spend 2 food and 2 larvae
- tech: spend cubes as indicated to increase ant colony level. Higher levels allow you to place larger pheromone tiles; may increase storage capacity (level 2); and are a location to send worker ants for different cubes
- objective: complete one of the 6 objectives if you meet the criteria indicated (e.g., remove ownership marker from tile, spend cubes, spend prey). May only complete objective up to 1 level higher than highest level you've completed so far. The nurse stays on the board. If other player(s) have already completed that objective, they earn VP (amount varies with player count). 

[u]Step 5[/u]
Finally, players simultaneously discard any cubes in storage beyond their capacity (4 cubes until tech level 2; 6 cubes thereafter). Cleanup: return ants from colony (tech tree) to worker room; nurses to nurse room (except those used to complete objectives). Pass Start Player token left.

[u]Step 6[/u]
- Winter: players must pay food cubes according to game turn (1/2/3) = (4/5/6) - # soldiers. Pay 3VP per food cube shortage. 
- After turns 1 and 2, repeat above.

After 3 winters, the player with the most VP wins (no tie breakers)!

RATING: 7
This game is very tight and brutal.  The amount of resources available in the game is light, decisions usually have a high cost, and there are few scoring opportunities and many of them (the objectives) carry with them VERY high costs.

There are a number of interesting things you can do on your turn so there is a very good amount of depth and interesting choices to make.  There are harvest phases every 3 turns as well so that classic worker placement mechanic of needing to feed your workers is ever-prevalent.

There was always something for me to do, in fact there was always more I wanted to do than I could.  The fact that most of the time using your worker consumes it (as well as scoring objectives consumes one of your nurses) always had me feeling like I was running in place instead of getting ahead.

I think that this game just has a different feel than I expected/was used to.  It definitely takes more than one play to really wrap your head around it because it is so deep.  My first game I was floundering around not really knowing what I should be doing until about 2/3 through the game when it all came together a little more.  I look forward to another play even if I'm not sure if my opinion on the game will go up or down.

This is a game about ants. It's clever and interesting to play at a certain extent but then again, it's a game about ants and for me it's done. I liked it and I see virtues in it but it doesn't challenge me being an ant.

Enjoyed first play, especially the brutal land grab behind the worker placement engine.

A little concerned with 2nd and 3rd play (2 players) as itr seems you need to be planning a path through the bonus tiles - in both games we seemd to come up with the same path.....Maybe better with 3 4 because of more than one pheromone front and the scoring  for going first in bonus areas

Rating went down with each play 8 - 7 - 6 - 5.

For some reason, ant worker placement is more fun than plain, boring worker placement. This game works for me because it is hard to play well. Trying to do everything is impossible - this is a game of optimisation.

Excellent blends of action, territory expansion, upgrade your colony's abilities. Brain burnery! You only get 9 turns all game, and only have a few actions, but it seems like a lot happens.

Worker placement with two kinds of workers (nurses and warriors/workers). You must manage both kinds.

Very strong and fresh theme.

The game is very interesting, but in our game ther whose to big downtime. When with more experience the downtime will be smaller, than my rating will go up.

Ants! Ants are a cool theme for cool guys. Deeeeal with it.

I finally bought Myrmes after eyeballing it for ages. Having read the rules, I'm curiously eager that this game will scratch the itch I was hoping to scratch with Archipelago: a clever, ultra-thematic euro about colony management. Except Myrmes skips the horrendous chrome that basically drowns the Archipelago experience. When could I ever get that fucker to the table again??

Meh. I was not impressed. Its standard worker placement - spend workers to get more actions in future turns. Then spend time gathering resources to make a more efficient engine so that you can gather a bunch of endgame bonuses. And don't forget to feed your crew at the end of the year.

The theme is ants instead of some historic age where you are running a business or family, but otherwise, there isn't a whole lot here that you haven't seen and done before.

Played a learning game with all 4 learning from the rules. Seemed hugely complex with too many options and contingencies for planning which couldn't all be kept in mind at once. I'm hesitant to play again as it wasn't very enjoyable, but I suspect familiarization with the game would make it better. The strategies would become less opaque and I could possibly aim to do more than just not starve each winter.

After reading about the game I was slightly interested. After reading the rules (my wife bought the game) I was really interested. After playing it I'm rating it a solid 9.

Myrmes features a bunch of mechanics - dice, area control, tile-laying, worker placement, etc. - and a ton of option for players, at least in terms of how best to develop the map. The game is fairly involved and some players will appreciate the Tetris-like nature of the tile placements. For me, though, the game felt a bit clunky, plodding and lacking in fun. Myrmes is undeniably clever in some respects, but for whatever reason it just didn't click with me.

The game left me feeling lukewarm. The theme is nice and well converted to the board, but there's something profoundly missing: which is depth in shape of lots of different options on your turn (there really are just a few) and a final game scoring. The lack thereof made the game very linear and as such it was very easy to see the outcome or a clear tendency long before the game ends with the players being deprived of the influence they should have to alter that outcome. The game would really benefit from a dose of momentum.

However, note that the replay value suffers a bit cause the setup is rater similar between games, and there is nothing stopping you or your opponent from basically copying eachothers' moves almost exactly for many rounds. Also the lack of hidden scoring means that sometimes the ending isn't so exciting. REGARDLESS! Great great game!

Myrmes is played over three years, each of which is divided into 3 seasons each year (as you don't do anything in winter except eat). At the beginning of the year you roll 3 dice to determine which bonuses are in play in each season. You can spend white cubes (larvae?) to adjust those to other bonuses if you desire.

You start the game with 3 nurses (which are simply the bits you select actions with). Nurses can produce soldiers or workers which let you do cool explorey and fighty stuff. Or make larvae cubes, or go to the atelier to do cool stuff.

Workers can go out to lay pheromone trails... which can score points and reserve goods cubes which you'll get one every turn. Or they can work in your colony. The size of pheromone trails or what jobs workers can do in the colony depends on how far you've advanced your colony to date.

Soldiers allow you to fight insects or take over an opponent's empty pheromone trail or they can substitute for a food during the winter feeding.

In the atelier you can birth more nurses, build more exits to your colony, improve your colony level or complete a scoring objective (which requires sacrificing a nurse). Scoring an objective first is neat, as every other player to complete it in future rounds gives you some points, but losing a nurse is painful. The objectives change from game to game giving a lot of variability between games.

Myrmes is pretty tight in actions. You don't have a lot of workers (or nurses or soldiers) and many of the actions mean that you have to give some of those up. The game requires you to plan ahead quite a bit. Before you start your spring move, you should have a pretty good idea what you'll do in spring, summer, fall and winter feeding. Getting early nurses and soldiers is probably key to doing well in the game. In our play one player sacrificed a nurse to get an early scoring objective and was pretty much hamstrung for half the game.

Getting your pheromone trails out on the board becomes a challenge as the board starts filling up fairly quickly. There is an attacky way to remove other people's and replace them with your own, which didn't happen as much in our game, but which I think would probably happen a lot more in future plays. That might make the game a bit more confrontational than I care for... but maybe not.

This play definitely changed my earlier impression of the game. It's a solid game that has some interesting stuff going on. I'd like to try it a few more times at least.

RATING: 7
[thing=126792][/thing] is a tricky game - not exactly complex, but it sure gives this initial impression due to the quantity of available actions, the possibilities around the use of ants (nurses, workers and warriors) and larvae, the bonus of the turns, the building of a better colony and larger pheromone areas; coupled with the common goals and timming concerns, sure give a frame of a complex game. Still, when playing it, one can notice how direct things are, with clear and quick resolution of all actions and choices. In other words: explaining the game and its possibilities can be scary, at first, but the gameplay debunk this fear.

This, however, doesn't mean that [thing=126792][/thing] is shallow: no, as a colony of ants, it can be rather deep! The number of actions in a game are very limited, and the resources are sparse, at best; demanding a lot of careful planning to collect and use properly. Players are constantly losing ants, be in fights or exploring, and this requires constant effort to make more and send them in the most efficient way possible. There close to no room for waste (actions or resources) and the game doesn't give a helping hand in order to recover - there is no catch up mechanism.

[thing=126792][/thing] reminded me of [thing=39351][/thing], because of the round structure, the very limited amount of them and actions, and the short blanket to cover everything you want to do, as well as the similar richness of options, timming concerns and interaction - but [thing=126792][/thing] is more focused in positioning and gathering of resources, and less economic in nature.

Overall, [thing=126792][/thing] is a well knitted game, without mercy for errors and bad planning, with a fine level of interaction, plenty of room for strategy and planning, while still requering adjustments, keeping the players attention, due to the changing of the bonus each round gives. A smart game, that sures carries a lot of weight in its back.

Something is just missing with this game. I love the theme and so many of the smaller aspects of it, but when you combine the parts it's just a little off. The opening and the end-game both feel quite formulaic. And, while I don't tend to mind this, it can be a brutally unforgiving game where you you can be completely cut off from the board if you are not careful.

Myrmes is a solid medium heavy worker placement game that does not, however, really appeal to me. This has to do with the theme (bugs, and the ant minis almost look like spiders to me), but especially because the game really feels like work. It is very thinky, and I noticed I was counting resources and options before each and every turn. Also, it is very hard to recover from early mistakes in this game, and as a consequence, the game can result in huge gaps in scoring (I felt really sorry for the player finishing last). So, a very good game, but one that I did not particularly enjoy playing.

I like Euro games with interesting spatial reasoning components, especially when they involve direct conflict with the other players on a shared board (think Tigris and Euphrates). Myrmes definitely fits that bill.

Strong euro game with a cool theme, very little randomness and tough challenges.

[+] artwork and components are great, mechanics tie well to the theme, lots of choices, developments and competition on the board, a tight and unforgiving gameplay, expect a strong learning curve :) works diferently with 2p / more
[-] my main issue is with turn order, which can have a strong impact for objective scoring and in some case creates a small inbalance (like p1 in a 3p game always plays 1st after dice reroll so doesn't know what to expect, while p2 and p3 will know what's to come during 'their' rounds...)

Note: tried the solo variant proposed by the designer, it works... but not very exciting.

This game looks and acts like a worker placement game (you have a personal board and a communal board, and you place specific types of workers in different places), but since you're working mostly off of your own board, and since the communal board has no restrictions on the number of different players workers' that can go on a space, it doesn't really feel like a worker placement game.  It's more like a worker/resource management game, which isn't bad, but the lack of restrictions makes the game much more multiplayer solitaire.  There are two ways to interact with your opponents -- on the board (though that won't really take effect until late in the game) and via the bonus tiles -- but for the most part you're off doing your own thing.  Plus, the end game is a little tedious, since it's just a matter of finding which option scores you the most points on the last move.  It's still enjoyable, and the game surprised me with its choices, but it lacks the OOMPH to make it a great game for me.

Tough choices on where to place your nurses (or whatever they're called) and whether to get more or trade them off for point scoring that locks them down.  The placement of the tiles will require some spatial awareness so beware if that's not your thing.

Each player has an ant mound board with a starting larva. Colonies forage and lay and clear pheromone trails to gain area control. Game is not forgiving, hard to recover from dumb moves.

Great complexity, but that same complexity slows the game down dramatically as each move should be carefully thought through.

Simply wasn't getting played enough here (I find that Dungeon Petz fulfills the same kind of desire for us, and plays better with 2). Hope Mike enjoys it!

Great components, great game-play and all based on a extra-great given theme. Must have, certainly.

For some reason this game was really hard for me to understand how to play at first. I am used to worker placement games but this one had a lot of new ideas going on and moving parts to it. However, once you get the hang of things the gameplay is absolutely exceptional. If you are used to worker placement games and want something that is a step up you might really consider getting this.

Insufficient player interaction until mid-game or so. Components are nice, especially the ants, but the individual player mats are too thin. The theme does not seem to be well-integrated.

The game is beautiful, the concept is nice, there is some clever ideas. But the strategie seems to mine linear to me. There is one way to score a lot of points and every player that take an other pass lose... In an other hand the score is always tight!

Enjoyable game, rules are a bit of a struggle as they're not that smooth in reading compared to other games. However once you kick off everything kind of falls in place without saying. Recommended!

I bought this game for the word pheromones. :-)
Good game. The game seems to me a little bit "solitary" with poor interactions with other players.

Fantastic arts re the world of ants!
For worker-placement gamers who REALLY like optimizing scarces resources.
I really enjoyed the fantastic software implementation on boiteajeux.net

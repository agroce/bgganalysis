RATING: 7.5
Juego sobre las batallas en los altos del Golán durante la Guerra del Yom Kippur. es divertido ver como el sirio avanza y el israelita contraataca. A pesar de ser sencillo hay qe meditar bien las operaciones para logrr los éxitos necesarios. Recomendable.

One of the best of the SCS series. It took me quite a bit of play to ascertain exactly what the Syrian Army can & cannot do; this whilst working within a very strict time-frame. The opening 4-6 turns are truly a massive whirling & twirling tank battle that compares to Kursk.

It seems to me that the main interest in Heights of Courage lies in mastering its variation of the Standard Combat System.  Most of the units in the game are mechanised and so they are capable of moving a significant distance twice or even three times (if Israeli) per game turn.  Add to that a wide front, low counter density, ZOCs that mostly aren't rigid and supply that gets restrictive on the opponent's side of the anti-tank ditch.  The threat of being out-flanked and the dire consequences of a thinly spread defensive line being punctured are ever-present concerns.  The result is a tense and tactically interesting game.  In Newhouse's design it seems that supply is as much about operational independence as it is about bullets and fuel.  It effectively obliges the Syrian player to eschew the flamboyant blitzkrieg tactics and conform to his army's rigid doctrine. 

My one reservation with Heights of Courage is about the strategic choices it offers.  The victory point locations and a ticking clock for both sides (the Syrians must maximise gains before significant Israeli reinforcements arrive on turn 4, for the Israelis it is the uncertain timing of a ceasefire) seem pretty firm strategic tramlines. 

Production standards are standard MMP; a paper map and small, thinnish counters.  I found the graphic design a mixed bag.  The information on those small counters is clearly presented and the phase track is useful. However, much more often than usual I found myself squinting under opposing stacks to check for small but significant terrain features.  The rules are an easy read, but strike me as vague in parts.

After playing and thoroughly enjoying "Yom Kippur", buying the Syrian-front sister game was, as they say, a "no-brainer".

Fun game...Though, it needs several house rules. Israeli air and artillery is underrated.

RATING: 7
I think HoC captures the feel of both sides well, i.e. both sides feel the desperation of their situation equally! The Syrians must push hard regardless of casualties. The Israelis must hang on. It's a tense game, heightened by a brutal and swingy CRT. Unfortunately, like most SCS games, playing time is long, even with the short scenario - about 6 hours. The full game? Good grief...

What I really enjoy about this game and the SCS in general is that I never have to fight the rules...rather I find myself thinking about defining and then, how to achieve my objectives etc...I'm a Europa series guy....have almost all the TCS/OCS games...enjoy complexity also....but this series immediatly....just....let's you play!

RATING: 7.5
Very good Standard Combat Series game. The usual SCS values: decent components and price, simple rules and focus on gaming over simulation, despite bits of chrome here and there that add some flavour.

I like this SCS entry because of the fact both sides can attack and defend, and even defending one can raid effectively enemy lines sparsely. Bloody CRT encourages attacks at low odds to exchange losses at times, so everytime 

Supply rules are quite simple but remark the rigid nature of Syrians and the more dynamic of Israelis. Things as replacements or air units are also traditional and lack detail.

The campaign game is tense, interesting and replayable. It seems very balanced. The mobility of Israelis provide a wide range of options to attack, so the Syrian player must react always quickly. Maybe the campaign game is a bit too long for me.

I have to say I was impressed and enjoyed the experience. I'm not much of a solo gamer, with this one taking me 5 months to "complete", but this game has piqued my interest into checking out other SCS titles. I'm also happy to say that there are enough similarities with the OCS series that rule crossover occurs in several areas, but without most of the unnecessary complexity of OCS. For example, you still get a taste for supply with SCS, but at a level appropriate for quick and easy play. Finally, I like the balance SCS has struck with playability and historical accuracy.

Nice companion to Yom Kippur....unfortunately the the graphics dont match the earlier game's icons...and no system for linking the games is provided. As a stand slone game it's one of the better SCS titles.

Really a good game: Syrians must attack strongly to have a chance to win by the end of the gamme (17 GT). Israeli must hold the line before being able to make a determined counterattack because a cease-fire could be imposed by Great Powers beginning with GT12... Very tensed !

La SCS posee una salud envidiable.... Buenísima continuación del Yom Kippur. Juego divertido, aunque muy exigente para el israelí, de momento con mi corta experiencia.muy interesante la posibilidad de elegir la secuencia de juego, dependiendo de si queremos refuerzos o no....
típicos componentes de la serie, si los cambiarán no sería lo mismo.

Brave New World FLGS 2013. SCS is too simplistic for me.

RATING: 7.5
A different feel from most games on this subject, which would be due to the SCS treatment.  Very easy to get into and play, but deciding upon a strategy for both sides is very challenging.  The cease-fire mechanism is in my opinion what makes this game work as the Israelis are up against the clock.  I would have rated this higher except for the annoying Israeli set up and reinforcements (trying to find the exact units is painful)plus the fact that there was no attempt to tie it into its sister game Yom Kippur.

Too much "IDF greatness" in the rules to make it fun.  

Somehow entire brigades of IDF units can be in supply in platoon strongpoints along the tank ditch (even without trace supply).  And it is entirely possible for IDF units to pour into those strongpoints on GT1, which unless the Syrians go crazy with hot dice, makes those strongpoints almost unbeatable.

Zvika rule also is a bit too pro-IDF.  The counter (representing 2-3 tanks) can literally destroy Syrian brigades throughout the game unless the IDF rolls to remove the unit.  Not sure this game belongs in a game that is battalion scale.

Add the IDF uber-mobility and the Syrian supply issues and you have a game that is just not all that fun.

Fun game, toward the end you get a lot of counter clutter as units pile up on top of each other.  Not a lot of depth, but it is an SCS game.  A few fiddly rules, but nothing to bad, will keep and play again,  make sure to destroy strong points if selecting no retreat option. :)

I like the SCS system and the transition to more modern day battles.  This one has a lot of armor and gives a more detailed look and play with the units involved. Fall back, hold out, reinforce, retaliate.

A good, accessible game, where the challenge is to beat the opponent and the situation, not the rulebook. A player's game. My review is here: http://boardgamegeek.com/article/11894437

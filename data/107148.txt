Playtester. Small improvements over Wings of War, but the game was so good to begin with!

RATING: N/A
I started playing Mustangs and Messerschmitts years ago, and about that same time I was introduced to Fighter pilot and other air to air games.  At the time I thought they were the best games out there...  Then along came Wings of War WW1 and then later WW2 by Nexus games.  Andrea Angiolino and his partner devised and put together an air war game like no other.  After playing it a couple times, I found the rules system simple and easy to learn.  All I needed to do was develop the "Eye" for figuring out where the airplane will end up when I plot it's movement.  That comes with experience.  Overall this is a very easy game to learn and play.  I love the pre-painted aircraft for the game, but sometimes I just cannot help myself and either repaint one or get an alternate source of aircraft and then paint it myself.  That is the model hobbyist in me.

RATING: 7
The included aircraft are an odd choice.  It's a good miniatures game that is a little clunky because of it origin as a card game--especially in how it handles overlaps and altitude.

SOLO PLAY:

1 Player Minimum
X Player Maximum
(X is the number of players and planes you have.)
The entire Wings of Glory/War franchise is excellent. I record my plays for Wings of War/Glory WWII on this entry. All other Wings of War/Glory I have listed as expansions.

So much fun. So versatile. By far my favorite mini's game.

Re-release of Wings of War from new distributor.  Same overall quality with excellent miniatures and gameplay. The reorganized rulebook makes it easy for anyone to jump right in and play in a matter of minutes using the Basic Rules, all the way up to the Advanced Rules for the "serious" wargamers.

Gave it another shot at GenCon 12, but my opinion of it didn't change.  Much prefer X-Wing for my miniature aerial combat.

I have only played the basic damage game, but it is a lot of fun. Preplanning and trying to guess your opponents moves is just like a dogfight would be

RATING: 6
Current rating is based on using the advanced rules, and few of the optional ones; basic game would be rated 1-2 points lower.

As a game, I generally prefer CY6 (less fiddly) or Fighting Wings/Buffalo Wings (more detail).  The miniatures are perfect for any of the games!

For some reason I don't like the WW2 game nearly as much as I like the WW1 game. My opinion of it has grown somewhat after playing more Sails of Glory (weird stretch, but true). Unlike that game, I don't play with many of the optional rules.

Played this with a friend and had a lot of fun. Reminded me of a WW2 arial themed RoboRally (in a good way). Did seem a little fiddly to control 2 different planes with 2 different decks, might be better with only 1 plane pr player

I enjoy this game.  This is the game that X-wing Miniatures is based off of. I like many of the differences such as hidden damage so you don't know how many hit points your enemy has left after shooting at them.  The differing speeds changing how you can turn is also a good thing, though it does add complexity and makes planning turns a lot more fiddly than the X-Wing game.  The Plane miniatures are pretty nice too, though I wish they had more types available.

RATING: 7
I love the theme, the miniatures and the mechanics of this game, but after I've played X-Wing, I wish this were a bit less fiddly. Using cards for maneuvers is not very practical and much less precise than with the rulers in X-Wing. This is really my only complaint.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Absolutely brilliant yet simple game system that works like a charm for those of us who read the Commando comic books and built model ww2 aeroplanes as a kid. For best results requires additional plane miniatures and some atmospheric gaming surface such as the official game mats or similar... 

Edit: For some reason all my friends hate this game. Those simple savage bastards, they have no concept of true art.

RATING: 8.3
Very similar to X-Wing, of course, but a really clean, simple game that's very enjoyable. I've only played on the basic and standard rules, and haven't tried advanced, but not sure I need to. I have more planes on order so I'm hoping to see more variation in capabilities rather than the similar handling of the planes in this starter set.

RATING: 5.5
Simulation/planes/WWII fans will love it, I'm sure. For the average Joe, it's too fiddly. To many rules that, altough great from a simulation point of view, are too cumbersome for those looking just to have a good time blasting planes out of the air.

Excellent game with a brilliant system! Social, deep and fun! 

I also own the X-Wing Miniatures game, and although a lot of people seem to compare the two games, I strongly believe that (the obvious similarities aside) the games are actually quite different. I think (if played with the Advanced Rules), Wings of Glory WW2 provides a much more realistic and deeper experience than the X-Wing Miniatures game. This does not mean that the X-Wing is not fun, it actually is! Very much so! It's just that I don't think that the two games can be so easily compared to each other. I own both games and they both scratch different itches. 

Wings of Glory WW2 (and I am sure WW1 too, I just don't own it!) is a great game! As is the Sails of Glory! :)

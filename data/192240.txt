• very easy to learn
• a nice and quick game
• volatile gameplay; sometimes you run out of options and lose right away but there are multiple rounds per game to account for such occurrences
• very sleek art and product design

Control is a very good game, expecially when you are trying to bring new people to boardgames.
Easy to learn, quick to play and with a good deepness to it. New player will easily get into it and discover more deep strategies.
Ability to play in teams of two also allows you some good strategy and the options team get are pretty interesting.
I did not regret participating in the Kickstarter and will initiate a lot of friends to the game.

Only problem I find is that experienced players can simply wipe newbies and a game can be really short if you get the proper hand. Some more counters would have been interesting to see. I hope to see expansions for the game and/or mayba a way to play for 5-6 players because 4 can be a little low in a regular game group.

A solid game for 2 to 4 people. I've mostly played it with three people, and it's almost always a good time. The bronze card effects really shake up the game and make it challenging to reach the "magic number" to win. It's a great short game to play in between bigger battles!

Always played it with 2 players and love it. Perfect game for a Holiday. It plays fast and has a lot of strategy to it. It's easy to learn and got a lot of variation. I like the tokens to play "best of 5" games, because sometimes a game only last a few minutes. It's nice to bluff a player and it's really hard to get out of a defensive position. Nice that there are 4 cards of every card type, so you can guess or gamble if someone has a certain card. Very well balanced and a lot of thinking and strategy every time I play it.

Control is one of my favorite new games of the last few years. Short and sweet, its easily one of the most elegantly designed games I've seen in a long time. A quick read through the very short rule book is all you need to start playing, and you won't ever have to reference it again. It's always in my bag for Game Night, and its an excellent quick warm up before more complex games or while waiting for more people to arrive. Great art and attention to detail. The quality of the metal tokens is amazing. Poker style playing cards so no need to sleeve them. I will be keeping a close eye on Keymaster Games. Anticipate great things from them.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Simple rules, quick gameplay, always fun and admirable beautiful!
Each game I was always confronted with tough decisions to make, and each round was suspense-packed and pulsating! One of the best "small" games I encountered in a long time!! Give it a try!!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Quick, thoughtful head-to-head card game. The nature of the game is very fast and the artwork and components are high-quality. The coins are especially nice. Notably, rounds can be unbalanced since it's all card drawing. The game recommends a best 3 of 5 match to help alleviate this. My experience has shown that with equally skilled players, the player going first will usually win simply based on the extra action. In summary, a quick satisfying play.

Why this isn't a 10:
-> Other better good 2-player games
-> Simple gameplay doesn't yield much replay at once
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Deeply afflicted with Kickstarter syndrome: A goofy little $10 "take that" game wrapped in an absurd package. I mean, come on...metal coins? Plus it's way too "take that" to actually be much fun.

RATING: 8
Played the PnP version and have backed the game on kickstarter. Very fun, there's some balancing issues that occur when playing just 2 player, but that can be fixed by removing the 4 "Nova" cards. 

Fun game, I highly recommend it!

Quick round based strategy game. Each round takes a well played strategy. One wrong move is all it takes to lose that round. But that's what makes the round system so brilliant. Make the wrong move the first round, no worries, the next round is easy to set up and try again.

Nice filler that is a bit too swingy for my taste (at least it is with 2 players) I have yet to try it with 4 but I feel it would become more tactical that way. We played one too many hands that were over before they started it seemed because of luck of the draw, and we found that getting a good first hand almost always meant the win. The game's saving grace is that it is quick and light, so you don't feel too cheated when things don't go your way, or too cheap when they do, and on the times where the game hits that nice balance its got some good back and forth play.

If i were rating the components alone the game would be a 10. the art and design are excellent, the box is flashy but not garish (something that this amount of gold foil could have easily become, but it is balanced by the stark White and thick nice font of the word CONTROL in the center) the cards are great quality and good prints, the coins are thick and chunky so it feels good to win one and the insert feels nicely sized to fit your cards and then a few more if they ever decide to expand at all.

I think 6 is about the right score for this, Will play if in the mood and asked, and the nice box and design might be just enough for me to pull it out to show it to someone new.

Have played 20+ times and very much enjoy the game. I enjoy all player counts. I always play best of five, unless we are getting in a play during a quick bit of down time. Partner play is very fun and adds that layer of discovering how to work with another player without being aware of there capacity. So, four player is probably my favorite, but I will play 2, 3, or 4 any time. :)

A very light "filler" game that is quite well put together.   It is one of those games that you can pick up very easily and play, but has a lot of thought once you get into it.   The rules are easy to follow.   The cards are attractive and easy to read and it is very small and portable.   In all, it is a very nice casual game.

A quick, take that, strategy filler game with the theme of time-travel in a sleek sliver and gold motif. Art is well done and the components are high quality, but the game isn't quite substantial enough to want to pull out on its own. The game goes by very quick, which makes it a good, easy-to-learn filler.

Control lived up to my expectations! Very fast to learn. Simple and fast gameplay but with strategic deceptions to make. And this is a great game to play with non-gamers because its so simple and fast. I also like that you always have to keep an eye on your opponents cards, if you dont the game can be over very fast! Love it that there are so many different cards in the deck with many fun abilities. And the artwork and graphic design is amazing!

Similar to Munchkin- the goal is to accumulate "21" but other players can take/destroy your cards and knock you out of the lead. Ruthless, you have to always be on top of each other. Confusing instructions, still not quite sure we played it right. Boring, dark cards with a theme I don't quite follow. It ran long, in the same way Munchkin can, because you're constantly restarting at zero when everyone squashes each other. Not really my scene but an okay game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
I don't see the appeal.  I've played it a few times now with various player counts.  It only takes 3 or 4 cards to win, so players must either constantly attack each other or attempt to play cards faster than anyone else.  The game simply isn't long enough to allow for any form of strategizing.

Love card games that can be played in teams. This is one of the fastest and one of the bests. (Team Play and Loot are cool too).

Feels like blackjack with superpowers and a little bit of Domino (if played in teams).

Better played with 4 or 2. 3 players games feels unbalanced.

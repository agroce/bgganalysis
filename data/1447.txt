I like it very much. Today I would prefer [gameid=63170] as it seems to offer more for less. In particular I'm not so found of "historical changes" in the game.

Yet allowing corporations to own shares in other corporations is great. I wonder how [gameid=63170] would change by having that as well...

Nasty game where you aren't playing the other players as much as you're playing the game.  That is to say, while other players can screw you, the game will screw you.  Vellani just has a knack for making games where players are always poor and struggling to get by.  That said, the ability for companies to buy shares in other companies is very cool as is the ability to buy tokens.  We never got as far as trading shares with each other which would have made this game much more vicious.

Good god, what a mess of a game. This is stock-fiddling extraordinaire, as winning seem s to involve starting a company, having that company start another company, having that second company start yet another company, leveraging the hell out of your initial investment so that it can eventually roll up all the cash to the parent companies while the daughter companies fail and the stockholders (the game system will buy these shares for some reason) get completely screwed. You end up with 5 stock certificates backed by 4 companies running 6 trains and the only game seems to be making sure your companies survive long enough to dump large quantities of stock on the unsuspecting bank pool. All in service of getting one company two permanent trains that run for colossal amounts of money.

I played recently, and the game went about 6 hours, which wasn't too bad, but this was actually only like 4 share rounds and about 10 ORs. The whole time was spent in companies pushing around paperwork. It's insane. There is a game here, but it's not an 18xx game - this is the 18xx engine being tortured into something that it just isn't. If this is the game you wanted to make, design it, don't try to shoehorn it into the poor, abused 18xx paradigm.

You remember when you told a lie?  And then started to get caught so you made a slightly bigger lie to cover up the first one?  And then you told yet another lie to prop up the second lie where it was a little wobbly, and then a fourth because hey, why not...and then next thing you know you're healing people on late night TV and the IRS are auditing you and there's a man with a glass eye...and then your alarm goes off and pulls the string that's tied to your toe and of course now you remember!   You tied the string on your toe to remind you about the stitches from when you sold your kidney and no, you never had financial relations with...  You remember all that, right?

Then you also remember this string.  This string that is tied to the pin that used to be in that grenade.  And now it isn't.  Isn't in that grenade any more that is.  Quickly now, you remember that too?  We don't have long.  You probably shouldn't have pulled [i]that[/i] string.  You probably wanted the [i]other[/i] string.  Oh well, I'm sure it was going to be good.  Was, what with the spinning plates and all.  I didn't forget the plates, did I?  Did you?

Yeah, 1841 isn't like that.  Well, not [i]entirely[/i].

1841 is justifiably known as the pinnacle of stock shenanigans. The game basically takes the standard 1830 branch game play and adds borders, mergers, and the ability for companies to own other companies. What this creates is a variety of complications to the standard 18XX formula and one hell of a beastly game and one that is brutally long on the first play, 300 minutes? Maybe once everyone has played a time or two to get familiar with the rules and has a drill sergeant guiding the phases.

I frankly think that I haven't played enough 18XX games to fully appreciate what this one brings to the table. Simply trying to learn this game took me back to the day where I first busted out an 18XX (1860) and had to learn it straight from the rules. 1841 adds so many things on top of the normal game engine that it almost felt like learning a new game system to me.

In the course of play, there are a number of things to juggle: companies always seem to be much better financed than the players and seemed to be the entities that had the greatest ability to start up new companies. Midway through the game, a couple of historical events occur which throw the game for a loop with one company splitting in two, and in the other case, 3 companies merging together in Tuscany. Interesting historical flavour, but overwhelming to deal with the first time through.

Quite honestly, that last line could likely be applied to the game overall. It's long, it's complex, and I think I would probably enjoy it more if it was a bit more stripped down (i.e.: remove borders, remove non-historical vs. historical stuff, remove historic events at phase 4) because the sheer weight of the bells and whistles made it hard to even get going on the basic game mechanic.

Overall, interesting game, likely easier to play and more enjoyable with a second or third play. My main concern is having A) the right group for this B) the time. 18XX games are an occasional sight on my table as is, and this is one bear of a game. It offers unique elements, but it also threatens to capsize under its own weight at times. I ultimately opted to sell my copy because of these issues. Ideally, I would like to see someone take the companies own companies bit from this and make a much more stripped-down game that only uses that mechanic, I think it would be a much better game for my tastes.

The first truly [b]enhanced[/b] version of the 1830 system that I've encountered (admittedly a small group). No weak rules here (possible exception, the rule about sales prior to first ORs). Vicious and beautiful. The distinction between historical and non-historical corporations is a bit clunky, but it makes the initial auction a bit easier to judge (relative). That said, I have no idea what the (actual) fair values are in that auction.

1841 is an odd-duck in the world of 18xx games. Its system of minors and mergers were mind-rending and require a lot more study on my part to leverage effectively. However, the most intriguing part of the game was the ability of companies to engage in emergency fund-raising as well as to invest in other companies altogether. These two features allowed companies in trouble to acquire funds via channels other than player funds (which is truly a last resort). The map was tight and expensive and in my singular game I fear I chose a historical company that's slow to develop (Strada de Ferro da Torino a Cueno) and was a non-entity for half the game. However, after some stock finagling, strategic tokening, and the fact that I finally finished a high-paying route I managed to scrape my way into 3rd place (out of 5). It was a fun come-back even though I never had a chance for the other top-2 places. Overall 1841 is a fascinating game that deserves deeper study and more plays.

I own the Deep Thought Games's 1841 version 2.0. A much better beast than version 1. The change of several minor companies into major corps makes the game more balance and less draggy IMHO. The components for version 1 are also included in the box if I ever feel like playing v1 instead of v2. All in all a great heavy game. Not recommended for beginners just starting out on 18EZ or had less than 40 games of 18xx under their belt. Also, not for the faint hearted (Read : Massive train rush).

There's nothing about an 18xx game that provides me any form of enjoyment, and so the prospect of spending another three hours(at minimum) per session at least half a dozen more times just to progress past the conscious incompetence stage is unappealing.

Played one game solo to learn the rules.  This is due to get played over MLK weekend 2010.

The train rush is brutal and has an extra layer as 5-trains now rust.  Companies can be merged if they are connected to each other; this seems critical in order to manage one's otherwise massive train liabilities.  Tokens are bought in advance which is...strange.  I'm not sure if I like that aspect but it requires planning at the very beginning of a company's existence.  

Update 3/2010:  Finally got 1841 to the table.  Other than the fatigue of a 9-hour game the experience was incredible.

RATING: 5
If you're one of these hardcore gamers that can be woken up in the middle of night and still don't find any challenge in ordinary 18xx games, then 1841 might be for you. For normal guys like me who still fumble around in any common 18xx, it's over the top. Companies investing in other companies, founding new companies, dumping their shares on the bank and merging the remainders leaves me irritated. Somehow I managed 3rd out of 6 in my one play just because two other players went bankrupt and only two players really played the found-dump-merge game. Even more artificial than the usual found and loot. Track building plays a far lesser role than in any other 18xx I came across.

RATING: 9
The wildest 18xx ride around. I played quite a few games of this years ago (v1 rules) with the same people, and I'm pretty sure none of us ever really got a handle on reliably doing well. Just lumbering along from one crisis to another.

1841 is one of my favorite 18xx games.  I might feel that way because of the hours invested in painstakingly assembling the gamekit, but actually this game stands on its own merits.  The complexity might turn off some, but this is an 18xx veteran's dream.   The ability to merge corporations is just one of many new mechanisms.  There's more mays to screw your opponents but just as many ways to send yourself into bankruptcy.

From description:
[i]1841 is the apex (or nadir depending on your point of view) of 18xx stock-market manipulation. Set in Northern Italy during a period of rapid political change (borders for playable hexes change twice during the course of the game) the game is one of the most difficult even for experienced 18xx players.
The greatest innovations center on the ability of companies to own shares in other public companies and the merging of companies. Train obsolescence is rapid and unforgiving, and it is quite possible for forced-purchase trains to be obsolete before they get a chance to run. Capitalization is on a per-share basis throughout the game and train prices are steep >1400 for an 8 train - the largest.[/i]

Looks very different from others 18xx. In my first game I was really confused how to play. I need to play more.
It has potential to be a great game. I like the idea of buying company shares by other companies. 
On the other hand there is a L-O-T of downtime. Also I don't like market prices. They look oddly.

A very open 18XX that has a lot of interaction (as they all do) and a lot of options on each turn. Not for beginners as the mergers and option of companies owning shares of other companies gets complicated. But if you like 18XX and can handle the complexity, this one is excellent.

RATING: 10
UPDATE (Dec. 27, 2010). OMG, Four player game, all relatively experienced in 18xx games; three of us have played 1841 before. It took us only five hours! One player won by selling all of his stocks in his corporation's IPO and start a new corporation. This enabled him to control the rush.

UPDATE (Oct. 24, 2010): Finally played a whole game of this with 6 players. It took us about 9 hours (with an hour dinner break). However, only two of us have ever played 1841 before, one was a newbie, and two have only played one game of 18xx. There were two players eliminated. One player who was president of the SSFL ended up with only two shares of SFLi after the Tuscan merge and was essentially out of the game, and another player went bankrupt.

The merger mechanic is wonderful. In typical 18xx games, you simply watch your stock value move one space at a time. Here, because of mergers, values of stock jump dramatically.

The ability for companies to buy stock in other corporations and even start new corporations is essential. If a company still has stock remaining in its Initial Public Offering, dividends that should be paid to those stocks go to the company's treasury. (With games with partial capitalization, it goes to the bank.) As a result, companies become over-capitalized -- if no one has been buying stock in that company. So 1841 gives companies something else to buy other than trains -- other companies! 

One criticism, though, but I think it's the nature of the game: Track laying is not that interesting compared to other 18xx games, like 1856. 1841 has various geographical and political features (such as the Alps and country borders) that greatly restrict where you can place tiles. However, this is probably necessary because you can start new companies anywhere on the map -- perhaps it is this flexibility that makes track laying not as interesting. You don't have as many tricky logistical problems of trying to link up two separate companies located on opposite sides of the board, nor the challenge of trying to find -- or block -- a route among a congested mass of tracks and tokens. Also. in 1841, you don't have the issue of tile shortages like you do in 1856.

------------------------ 

UPDATE: Tried this a second time with (hopefully) the correct rules. There are so many more interesting financial "tools" to raise money compared to 18xx games -- all of which are far more interesting than simply withholding dividend payments. For example, dividends from share still in the Initial Public Offering go to the corporation, not the bank! Also, your corporations can buy stock and thereby receive dividend payments.

The best part, though, is how fast-moving 1841 is (it's still a long game, though). For example, after a first round, there's a very good chance that all seven corporations will be fully running, regardless of number of players. Multiple tile placements, quite high income payments, and all those financial tools enable players to start second (or third) corporations much earlier!

Many 18xx games "end" once players reach their certificate limits and corporations get their permanent trains. Once that happens, you're simply raking in money until the bank runs out of money. In 1841, the tension still mounts in the mid- and end-game. Even though there are 24 corporations in the game, the certificate limit is set quite low. In addition, in order to get the stock value of your corporation to the highest values in the stock market, your corporation has to buy the most expensive train. So how do you do this [b]without[/b] withholding dividend payments? One tactic is to start a new corporation, either with your personal money or corporate money, then merger that corporation with another. You end up with a new corporation with a much higher stock value and less certificates overall!

==========================================

The BGG comments and the BGG description aren't mincing their words when the call this 18xx game the most brutal one out there. They're right about the very rapid train rush, the focus on stock value manipulation (and lack of focus on track building), and how unsuitable this is for beginners! (In my first game, we had two total newbies.)

The game is very unforgiving. In my previous experiences of 18xx (1830 and 1856), there is enough room to fix small blunders you've made. Not so with 1841. It has a much more restrictive and expensive map (unlike 1856) which makes it very difficult to make lucrative routes quickly (there's ways to mitigate that, but that involves sneaky stock manipulation). Also partial capitalization and very cheap 2 and 3 trains (unlike 1830) make it hard to manage your corporation's capital.

Strangely enough, because the game is so tight, the game seems like it moves *faster* than 1830 or 1856; there's so much going on, with phases being triggered much too fast for comfort and even more negotiation since capital is both very tight and dynamic.

Whoaa, what a challenging and vicious game. I did worst ever in my first play but I'm eager to play more. It's probably the most complex 18xx but that's why I loved it! There are minor/major companies, different zones, merging, vicious emergency money raising etc. Companies can buy shares of other companies and can also start a new company. It's just hard to master so don't even think about this one if you don't have at least 20-30 18xx plays under your belt.

OK shape. If there is interest I´ll take some pictures before any trade deal.

At points brillant but flawed.  Cuneo (bad).  Mergers & company owning other companies (fair to good).  Too much money coming into the game (bad, very very bad).

Enough potential that I'll by v.2 when it is released.

While I have not played this yet it looks like it has great potential. It looks like it would be complicated but still fun.

Plus it is one of the few that you could get eight players in on it. One downside is the more players you get in on these 18XX games the longer it seems to take but still it should be fun.

A long but one of the best 18xx games, for experienced players only.  I would rarely turn down a game of 1841.

I strongly prefer the original rules set (with a couple of the common house rules) to the later edition rules.

(Caveat: One play, relative 18xx novice, grain of salt, etc)

I love 1830, in particular the stock-market shenanigans and brutal train rushing that are so integral to that game. I figured 1841, with its panoply of stock manipulation options (corporations investing in and controlling other corporations, mergers, etc), would be the 1830 experience dialled up to 11. Unfortunately, this was not borne out in my experience of the game.

I have two main issues with the game as compared with 1830:

1. Length - this is not so much a complaint about the amount of time that needs to be invested in this game, but more the amount of that time that features meaningful game actions. I imagine all 18xx games suffer from the potential for a stodgy endgame (1830 certainly does), where the board coagulates and players make only minor incremental improvements to their rail networks, which rarely changes the outcome. However, in 1841, corporations each having their own mini-Stock Round during each Operating Round more than doubles the length of ORs as compared with 1830, and much of that time is spent shuffling portfolios between companies owned by the same player. The turgid-but-endurable final hour of a regular 18XX is here pushed to an extreme which I lack the patience and inclination to repeat.

2. Player Interactions - 1830 is one of the few games where I'm consistently interested in what each other player is doing at any given moment (Die Macher would be another). The way players' mutual fortunes can be tied to the fate of a single company can make stock rounds exciting, especially the fear of being shortchanged with a company moments before it has to purchase an expensive train. There is plenty of table talk during these moments, and for me it is the lifeblood of this particular game series. In 1841, players will get hit by similar train woes, however I found this game to be much less interactive than 1830. Being able to own a company that can in turn start other companies (which you again own), allows players to essentially ignore courting other investors and play their own (no doubt exciting) solitaire game of corporation jenga. Corporations being able to sell their own stock to the bank also means that, with a modicum of foresight, a player can grow their corporate island and never bear the brunt of a train rush.

I liked the historical flavour of this game, the idiosyncrasies of the board, the audacity of its kitchen sink design. I will never play it again.

How to rate this game. It is 1830 with another level of complexity added to it, because companies can own companies, companies can merge, companies are split up, etc. Great concepts, but there is one major drawback: games take too long! I just finished a game that lasted from 3 p.m to 6 a.m.! And we quited agreeing who would win! I like a long game, but this is just a once in a few years game. So: 10 for concept, 5 for playability.

RATING: 9
Wow....what a terrific ruleset!  The movement rules are a little strange, so I did some vector math and wrote a small Java program to generate some simplified plot charts.  Using those for maneuvers, the game is just pure fun.  The combat is pretty brutal -- ships get chewed up pretty quickly and soon somebody's careening outta control with life support failing, or trying to eject their core before it goes critical.  Seems to scale pretty well up to several ships per player, but haven't tried more....  Having played a few times, there is this sense that maneuvering isn't a strong point of this game -- our engagements have mostly devolved into brutal battles of attrition.

There's some evidence that the designer intends to bring out a new version of the ruleset.  There are some issues that I'm sure he'd like to address, but the game itself is still a work of art and genius.  I really hope a new version comes out -- this game very much deserves its longevity.

The system is currently free, but divided in 4 books. Rules are very supplemental in each book, changing as new books were released. The system seems solid and it works, but lots of die rolls can break the strategy.

One of the few 'Starship Armada' games that actually works. I prefer it over 'Silent Death' for large fleet battles, and have on occasion run it at various conventions.

RATING: 7
The classic 'beer & pretzels' space combat game. Build up your fleets using whatever spaceship miniatures you have and go at it. The rules are scattered across a few supplements but OTOH they are free/downloadable, The rules are simple and elegant, although a bit basic. 

The current 'Fleet Book' edition (so called 'Version 2.5') has a bit of an imbalance issue where fighters/anti-fighter defenses are concerned. There is a set of 'Beta' rules being playtested which greatly diminshes the imbalance, but they are poorly explained and they add a layer of unecessary complexity to the game.  

While the game is meant to be played in almost any setting, there is an "optional" background which is shared by both Stargrunt II and Dirtside II. The setting is near-future, "hardish" sci-fi with recognizable Earth nations (Germans, Japanese,etc.) and a few alien races. While improbable it is rather fun. 

I gave it a '7' because while the rules are great for straightforward games they have little tactical depth and you basically go through the motions without any surprise. For instance a battleship that has 'X' thrust points and can shoot 'Y' batteries every turn will be very predictable.

Excellent generic sci-fi starship miniatures game, mechanics very basic but quite workable, full design rule.  Re-classed as a 9 because the big hang-up for me is the ship diagrams.  I'm building some in .svg, so they look better than anything I've found to date.

This is really a miniatures game, not a board game. BUT, if you like huge space fleet battles, this is the only system to play if you want to finish it in an evening.  Quick, fast, NO BOOKEEPING!!!, and fun.  I'm talking fleet battles with 100 ships in an evening here!  Best of all, it's generic.  Plug in your favorite background and go to town.  We had a blast doing Star Wars Battles with this.

RATING: 4
Solid fleet-on-fleet space combat game. Requires some pre-planning in setting up ships for a game, but moves pretty quickly and effortlessly once people start pushing systems. Generic system allows players to flavor their ships according to the universe they wish to play in and fleet lists for Trek and Star Wars exist on fan sites across the internet. Most games I&#039;ve played used micro-machine space ships from Trek, Bab 5, and Star Wars. (Good luck finding those these days.) You can use most _anything_ to represent your ships and play with as many or as few as you like. I&#039;m not a fan of even the mild book keeping this game requires and so it loses one star. Add one star if you don&#039;t mind light book-keeping and another if space combat gaming is a favored genre for you.

(For "2.5" edition: 2nd edition plus fleet books.) OK space combat game. Construction rules are easy to abuse, and there's no real reason to avoid single "super-ships" that I've found. The ships can be a little bland too, although a little web-surfing can turn up more flavorful options. On the plus side, it's pretty easy, and includes hex-less inertial movement as a strongly supported option. A decent game to play while spending an evening with your friends, watching episodes of whatever ships you've got on the table.

RATING: 7
Ground Zero Games starship combat game. Suffering in that it badly needs a new edition to tidy up the rules, which are spread across the basic rule book, a supplementary add on rule book and 2 fleet books (basically lists of various races/species ship designs). If you can work out which set of rules you are actually using it provides an entertaining game. If you havn't got it yet, hold off until they produce the next edition.

This game is VERY fun. I can pull good game parts off bad games, to have a lot of fun.   It's Star Trek!  It's Battlestar Galactica!  It's Bab5!   It's StarBlazers!  It's all of them.  
Now there is a bit too much luck sometimes.  But that's fine by me.
I rarely use the normal movement anymore.  I switched to a hexmap by tweeking the rules.

2017-10-02 : An interview with its designer on the Meeples and Miniatures podcast reminded me we played this a good number of times back in the days, including a mini-campaign. Using the "Hollywood" movement rules, not the vector based ones. The fact we actually played a mini-campaign of this is indicative of how much we liked it. These rules were ahead of its time. Downloaded them again to see if they still hold up after 25 years.

This is not a board game and is a miniatures war game simulating ship to ship combat in space.  With that said...

It is a great game for free from a great company.  Pick and choose your rules and build your own ships!

I run this locally using my modified rules as often as my gaming buddys allow.  Just Pick and choose the gamers you play with as well.  Or use scenarios that way everyone can enjoy a great game that is not ever going to be 100% "balanced"  and still get to play with space ships and intergalatic aliens and their own custom built ships.

Simple and to the point rules. Not a faithful depiction of space warfare but a great translation of wet navy to space. Love the giant battles but letting in min-max players can cause grief for all and force only a few designs. Designer has an excellent range of miniatures that follow the designed factions and races.

The game I played was "Full Trust Light" - a simpler version of FT.
I am not a war gamer of any kind; and didn’t really enjoy DBA as much as my workmates (who kindly teach me the game).

Surprisingly I quite like this light war game in space, may be due to my interest in BSG; or the cool looking space ship miniatures (~$6 a piece).
The trade off between speed and turning is simple yet interesting.

Hope to play a full game soon to see rather dog flight / tailing is possible.

A decent game when it came out, Full Thrust follows a 'naval' style of star ship combat (which I roughly agree with, based on economic rather than technical issues). Full Thrust fails for me because the written orders systems completely fails to simulate the decision cycle of even modern naval combat, let alone even more automated ships from the far future. It's very popular at my wargames club so I do play it from time-to-time.

Played this game a lot back in the 90's.  The only turn off was rolling for system damage, however have found a way to greatly speed up this process.

And I thought that Battlefleet Gothic 1.5 was straight forward.  This is simple starship combat at it's heart.  The vector movement is incredibly simple and helps this feel more like space then boats on a black surface.

[b]Issues:[/b]  The threshold system is a bit tedious and fighters / Salvoes feel oddly overpowered.  The game does not play as quickly as claimed, at least not in my group, but it does play faster then other miniature games.

going thru the Cross Dimensions book now, but have digested enough in the first 13 pages (plus options) to have a satisfying fleet-battle game.

(i read the official Light rules, but they seemed too light.)

anyhow. i've amassed plenty of space battleships over the years but never came across a ruleset that felt worthy of the brain-space. Full Thrust might just be that game: detailed enough where it needs to be, and abstracted where it doesn't.

i can imagine a variant of this also lending itself easily to WWII naval battles, or even Age of Sail naval battles -- and i've got plenty of those toys to use too.

Clean system, easy enough to understand and with minimal record keeping to control many space ships, and yet still return "realistic" results.  (It *is* a science fiction game, so I'm not sure what "realistic" would really mean, but I mean the vector-based movement "feels" like spaceships should feel, unlike something like Silent Death, which feels like tanks moving in the desert.)

Pretty much a classic for when it came out and what it does.  Starmada has a slight edge in this theme for me.  It's really only "space combat" in that it's got space trappings and an optional vector movement system; it's got much more in common with high-counter-density naval wargames than anything to do with space combat.

Started playing this towards late 1990's, after getting tired of not being able to fight out fleet actions in SFB in a timely fashion.  It's a great game that plays fast, and usually gives a good feel of the "movie-like" action of Star Trek and other space-themed combat.

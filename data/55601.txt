Definitely more of a family game which is a surprise after Chvatil's other games that I am more familiar with. Pretty simple concept... there are locations (# players plus 3) and you choose one to rob and one to police. If you're the lone robber you get the item... if there are police nothing is taken. And you play through a deck of treasure cards. The core of the game is trying to second guess the other players and make sure you in the running for points (accumulated by having the most, second most, ...etc) of each of the four item types.

This is a really fun little filler game. You can seriously burn through the vault with 4 players in 20 minutes or less, and I feel it is a great game to get everyone in the gaming mood to kick things off for the night. Trying to outfox your fellow players is fun and can be both rewarding and frustrating.

Rated as filler.  It's basically like Adel Verpflichtet lite or Hick Hack im Gackelwack.  You score various amounts for being first, second or third, in different colors of gems.  You try to steal them by playing a card to go to a location, but you only succeed if no one plays their snitch there.  It's simple and easy.  Don't go looking for anything meaty here.

First time I played with wrong replenishment rules which shortened the game to an uninteresting amount. I will retry with the correct rules in the future. The first impression is that the game is fairly simple and straightforward, but as with any blind bidding game it depends on you being able to subtly control the process to a sufficient degree. Lascaux and Fiji do this right, Sneaks and Snitches [i]might[/i]... But I'm not sure yet. I'll admit that the game is nice and quick though, and blows the ageing Hoity Toity in terms of execution of subject matter clear out of the water.

[b]Update[/b] Control in this game is difficult, but it is over sufficiently quick for people to finish in high spirits just the same. An unjustly shunned game, in my opinion.

Players are high-end crooks sneaking around stealing stuff, while trying to snitch on their opponents at the same time.  Simple game by Vlaada Chvatil, where players drop a couple of cards on the table then simultaneously reveal them.  One is a sneak, trying to pinch a card from a location, while the other is a snitch, trying to protect a card from being stolen at another location.  Snitches trump sneaks.  Chaotic game that ends when the deck is run through - points are awarded for majorities in four colours (Information, artifacts, gems, gold).  Like a lean and mean version of Adel Verflichtet - if you enjoy that classic, you will probably like this.  Fast and fun, if you're in the mood for some chaos.  Nice two player variant included.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Purely a guessing game, as players secretly select two locations each round - one for the sneak, and one for the snitch.   Do you go for the obvious play?  Or the low risk, low reward?  But isn't that more obvious?   Circular logic won't get you anywhere.   It's really just a complete guess, and whoever gets the luckiest guesses over the course of the game will win.   It's very fiddly for a short game, with a ton of card manipulation involved.   Still, it works okay as the filler it was designed to be.

Fun game but way too random for my taste. Somehow, other players always guess what I am going to do. I played one full game totally random, not knowing the cards I chose and did way better than when I play knowing what I do. I guess I just suck at this game. Good for laughs but not much else. It's quick at least.

RATING: 7.5
A new surprise from Vlaada Chvátil, feels like a grown up version of Pick Picknic, with some flavour of Witch's Brew.  This has less luck than Pick Picknic, and will appeal more to gamers, because it's all about blind bidding/simultaneous selection, and outguessing your opponents.  Easy to learn and plays very quickly (15-20 min), and is a solid bluffing & psychological filler (and thus won't be to everyone's taste).  Very little randomness, all about guessing & second guessing others.  Particularly good with 2-3 players, more chaotic with more.

Played this with 4 players and boy is it quick!

It made for a really nice quick filler game where the victory points were very very close. 

Could suffer if somebody was just playing cards randomly (as some people in my group are inclined to do) also suffers if you are consistently 'snitched' upon and therefore cannot get much loot but then I guess that is the nature of the game. 

Do you go for the big score and see it cancelled or try to sneak away with a smaller yield undetected? Not only are you trying to outwit your opponents by sneaking to an unsnitched location but you are also second guessing yourself.

The hidden item cards are really nice as this means you can never be sure you have a majority in a colour.

1st game (besides Crazy 8's) that I was able to play with my 4 yr old that didn't bore me to tears.  (Note: we don't play with the extra snitch in our 2 player game, and we don't really score either...).  It is funny getting into the head of a 4 yr old girl (will she go for the 'rainbow' jewels, or the blue that matches her dress...)  ;-)
[My 4 yr old would rate it an 8]

Played one 3 player game with her and my husband.  He thought it was too light (asked if I bought the game intending to play with my daughter- which I had not).
But I think we may enjoy it more if my husband and I play the official 2-player game.

RATING: 5.3
This light, family/filler card game centers around simultaneous bidding.  You can totally get screwed, but at least it lasts only 20-30 minutes.

Easy & minimal rules, and adjusts well to different number of players. Attractive cards.

I won't mind it if it hits the table a couple of times a year.

I have never been a fan of the hidden placement or blind bidding mechanisms.  I can usually tolerate them if they are a minor part of an overall game, but when they are the central -- or worse, sole mechanism -- intense dislike and aversion is usually the result.  Sadly, there is absolutely nothing more to Sneaks & Snitches than hidden placement.  Play two cards, see what everyone else played, and hope to get lucky.  There's nothing else here.  The game is completely devoid of any strategy or real decisions. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Really it came down to a 'guess' your opponents game that seemed kind of flat. There is some open and some closed scoring, so you can't quite know who's leading, but the 'guess' your opponent part of it makes you 'beat' up on the perceived leader while hoping others leave you alone.

This game is nothing more than a couple rounds of blind bidding. I don't like blind bidding games as a rule of thumb and this one did nothing to convince me to revisit that opinion. 

Played with 4. One other person also thought it was entirely random. One liked it. The other was in between. Not the worst bidding game I've ever played. Dynasties was better but only plays two. About a hundred quick fillers I'd rather play instead.

We played No Thanks immediately after and everyone thought that was a vastly superior game. After that we played Archaeology: The Card Game which is pretty random with four but we all still liked it better than Sneaks & Snitches.

I see no reason to ever play this game again.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (August 2013)

I love Vlaada games, in fact I bought this game only knowing its designer and nothing more. My expectation was met, Sneaks & Stitches is a fun, quick game to play from time to time. The game components are very nice, the art is ok. The rules are easy to learn and teach and the game itself takes around 30 minutes to complete.  I really like the double guessing needed to win, but many times it was dumb luck that I got some loot, so I’m not sure how much is strategy and how much luck is involved. 

It is way too light (more than I expected, thus the rating), but fun nonetheless.

Bottom line, the game is quick, easy and great to teach to non-gamers and family. For now it is a keeper in my collection.

Current Rating: 6.5

After more plays, I’m finding little replay value with the game. It is fun (sometimes) but I need to give it a rest. I think this will continue to go down in my ratings. Some players have done very well without thinking at all, they just picked a couple of random cards each turn. This is a mayor turndown for me, the luck seems to be uncontrollable. I need more time/plays to see how I feel about the game. 

For now it’s a 6.0 for me.

A fun, simultaneous selection game of trying to outthink your opponent. Plays well even if the theme isn't super strong. An enjoyable selection.

UPDATE April 2015. The more I play this game, the more I realize how wonderful it is. The layers it has, the accessibility, the psychology, the laughing. As far as fun, simultaneous games, it rules! As far as interesting thinky games, it rules! As far as accessible introductory games, it rules! As as shorter games that still play well with 5 players but arn't "party games" exactly, it also fills that niche well. This game is an underrated MUST!

Gioco di Vlaada Chvátil non molto originale ma sicuramente fluido e semplice. Gioco di bluff e intuito, i giocatori devono recuperare quanti più oggetti preziosi riescono. La distribuzione dei punti finali è molto particolare e quindi necessita di un po' di attenzione. Gioco molto fortunoso ma comunque simpatico e che si lascia giocare una volta ogni tanto, con l'aumentare del numero di giocatori il gioco a mio avviso diventa ancora più divertente (e spesso frustrante per le azioni che non si riescono a fare).

Each round, players secretly select one Sneak and one Snitch from their cards. Treasures with only one sneak are taken by the sneak, while one or more snitches prevent the treasure from being stolen. You have to guess what your opponents are going to do and then either try to foil them or avoid them.

This is a game where you play a sophisticated crime lord out to steal information, gold, jewels, and artifacts while preventing rivals from stealing. The game is based on simultaneous action card drafting combined with double guessing your opponent's moves. Easy enough to explain and finishes in about 30 minutes. Sneaks & Snitches is a good gateway game.

However, to be really fun, play Sneaks & Snitches with people you know well and have an understanding of their personality - how much risk they take, their usual motivations etc.

A bit of an odd game for Vlada, which is to say- very tame. The concept is so simple that you'll have a group of players up and going in no time. The one downside for me is thr 1st half of every game. There's not much int in bluffing until you see what everyone is trying to collect/score, so that first half is all build up to the real meat of the game. Still, it seems to hit the tale often enough to keep.

Jogo interessante e que dá muito que pensar! A ideia é simples, mas foi bem limada pelo autor, pelo que temos um jogo rápido mas com um conjunto de decisões difíceis e que a um certo ponto se podem tornar irritantes... Agradável jogo de ladrões, onde dedução e sorte se fundem com facilidade. Acho bizarro o sistema de pontuação, que pela experiência parece dar azo a muitos empates, sendo o principal ponto fraco de um jogo muito fácil de se explicar, ideal para iniciantes.

RATING: 7.7
Good filler game.  If you like a game that involves trying to out guess your opponent then this is purely what you are looking for.  Sometimes your mind just spins think about what your opponent is thinking about cancelling and what they might need and still trying to get something for yourself.  Theme is extremely thin but it doesn't matter.  I put this on par with other good fillers like For Sale and High Society

Card, Simultaneous Selection. If Coloretto is the streamlined, stripped down version of Zooloretto, then this is the streamlined, stripped down version of Hoity Toity. It has the same type of outguessing and double-think, similar theme, but without the static board, collecting gems instead of antique cards. Lots of fun, my parents enjoyed it as well, so acquired a copy.

Bumping my rating up. Been playing this with the lunch group and it's still great fun, quick, and scales well from 3-5.

An excellent family game.  It plays with up to 5 which is a good range.  I prefer the scoring with 4 however, because in the 5 player game you almost always end up with a tie.  Strange choice to have everything be worth 3 points.  Only takes 20 to 30 minutes once everyone knows the rules (that's with people playing slowly too).

Reminds me of FBI where you are trying to outguess your opponents and have to decide just how greedy you want to be.  Do you go for the big score and have it cancelled, or a lesser yield that might have a better chance?  Plays quickly and takes a few minutes at most to learn.  A fun 20 minute filler.

A mix of Hoity Toity with Edel, Stein & Reich. Fast playing and simple. Secretly choose which location to rob and which location to plant a snitch at to thwart other players. Try to get majorities in different items to score points. You can get secret cards that will add to your majority at the end of the game, which adds a good twist that you can't be sure of majorities.

The two player variant plays quite well.

RATING: 7.5
This is a great game of double guess and outthinking the competition.  Very easy rules, but great gameplay make this a winner.  You can play in less than 20 minutes once you get the hang of things so you'll likely end up playing multiple games in a row.

Loses a couple points for being too light but it's a great game for non-gamers or when you just want something simple.

In the BGG blurb for Sneak and Snitches, the game is described as a "fast-paced game of psychological suspense." I found it to none of those things. The game dragged, the psychology was on par with Rock, Paper, Scissors, and the suspense was more like frustration. As you might suspect, this is not a game for me.

The basic idea is sound: try to collect loot of different types. At the end of the game, the more loot you have a particular type, the better because you only score in a category if you have more loot relative to the other players.

To collect loot, you play two cards from your hand to a row of loot cards that are face-up in the middle of the table. Each card is lettered to match one of the face-up loot cards. In this way, everyone can play their cards face-down at the same time, revealing and matching them up with the loot cards only after everyone is ready. One of your two cards is a "sneak," while the other is a "snitch." If you are the only player to place a sneak next to a piece of loot, you claim it. However, if someone else plays a snitch next to the same loot card, you get nothing (the dirty rat!). Finally, if more than one player places a sneak next to the same piece of loot, you both get a booby prize, i.e., a less valuable piece of loot from a separate random deck.

Keep playing round after round until all the loot cards are depleted, and then add up points.

When you cut through the cards, the loot, and all the pretty gem-cubes that come with the game, you realize that Sneaks and Snitches is, at its core, a game about guessing. You try to anticipate where the other players will place their sneak and snitch card each round, and then try to place your own sneak somewhere else. Paying attention to what everyone is trying to collect is helpful because it gives you a foundation on which to base your guesses. However, it's still a guess.

The reason I don't like Sneaks and Snitches is the same reason I don't like Rock, Paper, Scissors. It feels too random, too whacky. A little bit of information goes a long way in this updated and more involved version, but it nonetheless feels more like the illusion of knowledge than knowledge itself. And while the game itself is only something like 20 minutes, I was done with it after a few rounds -- just not enough interesting decisions, and nothing to get me excited.

Nice filler.


There are several location which get a reward. First each player secretely choose where he sends his thief and where he sends the police. After that all players reveal this information. Each thief who is alone in a location gets the full reward, multiple thieves in one location get a smaller reward and each thief who is in a location with an police officer gets nothing.

This is more trying to outguess people with less players.  With more players you sort of look for averages a bit more (which makes the game go faster with more players).

An interesting little game of bluff and intuiting intent, and of course ensuring that you spoil the other guy's opportunities. The 2p asymmetry works well, with more it quickly turns into chaos as thieves stumble over one another.

With more than 2, it's a good, fast, lightweight game that I'm going to pull out more when I need something light and easy to explain with casual players.

This is kind of cute, and kind of clever, but what it really is is Hoity Toity: The Card Game.  On the plus side, it takes a lot less time to play, but on the minus side, it feels like a short version of Hoity Toity, since you're doing the same sort of second-guessing during the entire game.  I got tired of Hoity Toity's repetition, and this version doesn't really solve that issue.  Still, if someone brought it out to play it, I wouldn't cringe at the idea of playing it.  That's more than I can say for Hoity Toity.

In this fast paced game you become boss of sneaky thieves who’s after prestige rather than money. Decide well what category of items you will be after and try to predict what will other bosses do. Send your team to least expected location. Send your snitch to give police information about of competing groups. Let the world know who’s number one in your domain!

Imagine you are the head of a company of thieves. Oh, not a filthy band of cutpurses and pickpockets, but rather an elite cadre of elegant ladies and gentlemen skilled in the art of illegal acquisition. As their criminal mastermind, your job is to coordinate their efforts and gain recognition as the best in the business.
\13\\13\
You decide whether to enter the presitigious and risky field of information theft. You decide how much effort to focus on stealing artifacts and jewelry. And don’t forget about gold! Only the top thieves in each category will win the respect and admiration of their peers. Out-guess your competition and foil their plans, while sending your team after items no one expected you to steal.

I'm not entirely sure what to make of this one.  I had a lot of fun playing it but trying to outguess so many people left it feeling really random at times.

Might be kind of group dependent but with the right gamers its a blast.

Game plays fast.  A little too short even.  I feel like the gold die should be replaced by a deck of cards, as I really like the auction aspect, but it's a roll of the dice (err, die) as to whether or not one will even come up during a game.

Actually preordered this one direct from the Dr. Finn's website, as I love Biblios so much.

Not sure what to think of this one. The interesting long-term decisions you have to make in Biblios are basically impossible in this dice game, which forces you to choose an end game strategy based only on your current roll. It's not terrible to play, but I can't see why anyone would chose this over Biblios.

Decent dice drafting game of trying to race up tracks to get more gold and the most points. Dice are split into sets so you have the choice of making a big jump on one track, smaller jumps on other tracks, or likely taking gold. When the gold die has no gold you then do a simultaneous auction to see who will pay the most for all of the dice. Scoring is fairly similar to Biblios in that each track uses a die that can be altered during game play. Highest up the track gets 3x the points while second gets face value. It's a neat spin on Biblios but I'd still rather just play that instead.

Kinda, sorta like Biblios, but with dice and open information.  I like the selecting from a pool of dice mechanic and the 2 different auctions.  Quite fun.

Played for the first time. Opened gaming night with this game. Played again as closing gaming.

It was an enjoyable dice game. Ordered it.

Showed the game to my brother and the rest of the family. They liked it. Looking forward to showing the game to my cousin.

Update:

Change from a 8 to a 7. Notice something I didn't like. Once all the 10's and 5's are gone, you can get screwed if you get money and you got 10 cards in hand. You can't collect.

Made home rule. Only active player can make change and before rolling dices.

I like this game. It plays fast, has interesting choices, there are different strategies that can be used to win, and it scales really well from the lowest to highest player count. I have a problem with how people can take advantage of hoarding smaller denominations of gold cards for use in the resource auctions, but this strategy does not ruin the game and I still find it really enjoyable.

The game plays well at all player counts, maybe not at its best with just two, but still very enjoyable. I particularly like that, just as in the dice game versions of Ra and Alhambra, the theme and feel of the original game has been carried over, but that at the same time it still offers a different gaming experience. Sometimes, you really feel like throwing a few dice around and Biblios The Dice game allows you to do this whilst at the same time crating a clever balancing conundrum of coins and resources

I'm a big fan of Scripts and Scribes/Biblios and also like dice games that aren't just themed Yahtzee with dice-fiddling mechanics. Ergo, I was pretty eager to try this one out. It's an interesting beast: a dice game with auctions! It's very reminiscent of the original (being that the theme in both is pasted on, this isn't saying much) except that, unlike the original, it's more difficult to change course if things aren't going your way. I liked it.

It's slightly unfair to compare it to its predecessor, but lacks some of the elements what makes that a great one, like the intriguing, semi-secret card distributing in the first half, and the mandatory auction in the second. 

On its own right the dice game is still a good filler, but the random occurrence of auctions and open selection from the common pool dulls the edge for us. What remains, does not offer much over the cardgame, other than it's simpler, takes a bit less time, and there are dice, that can be actually rolled.

This game might just be better than Biblios, it's cousin.  The card quality is sub-par, but the gameplay is tremendous. I now use old Dominion cards to replace the original cards. Much better!  It's quick, simple, crammed with meaningful choices, and you get to chuck dice.  The design is superb.

Edit: Worth mentioning that this is one of the early "dice drafting" games that are now becoming very popular.  I don't think this and Castle Dice get enough credit.

Also, only reason I sold this was because I replaced it with the re-implementation "Biblios Dice".

RATING: 6
Remove the hidden information element of Biblios and replace it with dice rolling. Whether you think this is a good thing or a bad thing will determine how you feel about this game.

[b]Scripts and Scribes: The Dice Game [/b] was traded away in a math trade 4/14/14. (Received Bohnanza)

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]I was probably a bit hasty trading this one away, it was before I belonged to a regular gaming group. At the time I traded it away because my kids had a hard time playing it, especially when it came to the gold auctions. The other reason was the horrible art and mediocre components. I am very excited about Biblios Dice and will probably pick up a copy. I was really happy when I read how Dr. Finn streamlined the auctions and cut it down to one type (no more clunky gold auctions). I think this version will be much easier for my kids to learn.

Now that I have played Biblios I think the card version beats out Scripts and Scribes Dice, but I am looking forward to seeing how Biblios Dice compares.[/i]


[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- This is a fairly light game that my older daughter (8) can play.
- A game my wife enjoys.
- It plays well with 2+ players.
- Quick play time (less than a 1/2 hour).
- Dice rolling and dice selection to move up certain tracks to score points.
- The value of each track fluctuated because you can sometimes change the value of a specific column.
- The auctions, especially to be able to use all the dice yourself.[/i]

Somewhat similar to Yspahan in that it has a dice drafting mechanic.  But I think this one is better in that this does not have the wildly imbalanced cards that Yspahan has.  I really like the auctions that come up in this game.  This game takes most of the choices you would find in a full fledged euro and packs them into a game that has the game length time wise of a longer end filler.  Really good game.

Played twice last night. I liked it more than Biblios, but my wife is the opposite. I preferred having the open information about what tomes your opponent is collecting. In Biblios you could try to count cards or pay close attention and do a lot of guessing, but in S&S:tDG, it's pretty obvious and I think I prefer that. On the other hand, my wife, who is better with the "gut feel" side of games, prefers Biblios and consistently beats me at it.

Starting at a 7 but I think it will go up if I can get it back to table a few more times.

This is a cool dice version of Biblios.  It's interesting how this game stands completely on its own, yet all of the elements from the card game have been re-implemented here.

A Biblios kockaváltozata. Huh, elég nagy csalódás, bár a bemutatóvideó alapján sem vártam tőle sokat, de azért ennél többet. 7 kockával dobunk, abból egy szimbólum összes kockáját kiválasztja a kezdő játékos és lép a 6 oszlop közül a megfelelőn, utána a következő játékos választ egy kockacsoportot és lép és így tovább. Aki a játék végén az adott oszlopon a legmagasabb helyre ért az az ott levő kocka háromszoros értékét, a második helyezett pedig az egyszeresét kapja. A hatodik kocka a Bibliosból is ismert kockaállító. Ha ennyi lett volna a játék még lehet jobban is tetszene, de a hetedik kockával érdekesebbé akarták tenni. Három oldalán simán pénz szerepel, ami a játék végi pont is, egy oldalán titkosan lehet licitálni az összes kidobott kockára, egy oldalán adott összeg licitálásával egy kockát le kell venni a tábláról és egy oldalával pedig a kezdő játékos dobhatja újra a kockáit. A játékkal a fő gondom a hihetetlen szerencsefaktor. Persze kocka, ez rendben van, de egyrészt ez a nyolcadik kocka teljesen véletlenszerűvé teszi, hogy a kezdő játékos kap-e plusszot vagy mindenki más. Az pedig, hogy a kidobott kockákból sorban vesznek a játékosok teljesen szerencsefüggővé teszi, hogy ki hányszor cselekedhet a játék során. Igaz, hogy a játék 30 perc maximum, de akkora szerencsefaktor van benne, mint a Zombie Dice-ban, ami csak 10 perc. Szóval nem igazán tudom hova tenni a játékot. A Can't Stopnál kicsit jobban tetszik, de igazából csak az ügyes Biblios kockák miatt így több pontot nem tudok rá adni. Csalódás, a Biblios sokkal, de sokkal jobb játék szerintem.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a dice drafting game with some occasional light auction mechanics.  The whole game is very light and plays very quickly.

Each round the start player rolls 7 dice which will show a number of different symbols.  There are two types of auction sides that can be rolled on one of the dice.  At which point either a blind auction is conducted for the dice themselves or a reverse auction is conducted to sell your cube and therefore forfeit your position on one of the tracks.

After any potential auction is finished players draft the dice.  Like dice can all be drafted at once and players move up on the corresponding track.  When players are first or second to pass certain thresholds they receive money (used for the auctions as well as points at game end) and whoever is highest and second highest on the tracks will get more points at game end.

That's pretty much all there is to it.  This game has one of the mechanisms I dislike most in board games, immediate end conditions.  The game ends immediately when 3 cubes reach the top of tracks so some players can get more turns than others.  There isn't even an evening mechanism during setup to balance first, second, etc. players.

Other than that this game is passable as a filler.  It's easy to teach and has some choices behind the luck of the dice rolls.

RATING: 8
Just two plays so far, but a really good game.  Although errata'd before release, I'm not sure how the original hand limit even made it into the printed rules, it would quite literally ruin the game...perhaps it was from an earlier, much different version?  Anyway, there is much of the conceptual feel of the card game, but in here lies a much more subtle and deep game with many more controls over your fate.  The card game is a many-year go-to for a game night finisher for our group, and this will not replace it, as the dice game is a much more intense game experience, requiring both concentration and effective planning...things we're all short on at the end of the night!  The controls over game length, and multiple paths to victory make the game not only brilliant, but also pretty brain-intensive...this is no 18xx by any stretch, but you won't win just flying by the seat of your pants.

That said it is still relative short, playing in about 30 minutes, which makes it fit nicely as a night-opener.

RATING: 7.5
Just as Scripts & Scribes/Biblios took quite a while to build momentum and gather a very loyal following (I avoided it for the longest time, but fell in love with the game instantly when I finally played it), it might take some time for this little gem to garner the accolades it deserves.  Those familiar with Biblios will immediately recognize the brilliant twists that have molded it into a very fun dice drafting game.  And those who have not played Biblios will likely enjoy this simple, quick-playing, yet fairly strategic (despite the dice-rolling) experience.  The components are hit-and-miss, with the symbols on the action dice being printed rather than engraved, the board and cubes being functional, and the gold cards being downright ugly.  My favourite part is the funky hues chosen for the value dice.  All in all, after several 3- and 4-player games (I haven't tried it yet with 2 or 5) I have to say that this is a game that could qualify as a truly excellent "filler", and which deserves more attention.  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 3.5/5  Total: 7.5/10

RATING: 4
Not quite a dice-game "version" of Scripts and Scribes/Biblios, but clearly inspired by that game and with some superficial similarities. Unfortunately, those superficial similarities largely manifest in the ostensible theme (both games are very abstract) and in the barely-relevant trappings -- like having each resource track valued by a D6 -- stapled on.

I'm not a fan of dice games at the best of times but this one is a particularly irritating combination of randomness and unnecessary complexity.

S&S Dice takes the game you know and love and nicely converts it into a dice game.  There are tons of choices here.  I'm not crazy about the auction for resources, but that may just be because it was a 2-player game.  I need more plays of this before I start rating.

- standard turn: the player chooses a die (or dice) with the same symbol and applies them accordingly;
- auction for resources: players take the gold cards they have and put as many as they want in front of them, face down - once everyone stops adding cards, all the bids are revealed and the highest bidder takes and applies all the dice (then, they player whose turn it is roll the dice again);
- auction for gold: players, in turn order, say for how much gold they are willing to sell one of their markers - the lowest amount wins;
- re-roll action: the player whose turn is may pay 1 gold to re-roll as many dice as he wants. He then can pay 2 gold to re-roll again the dice he wants. Every re-roll adds 1 gold to the amount that needs to be paid.

In the game players are trying to get more gold, by advancing in five resource tracks and in the Abbot track. The tracks has indications of gold on them, that the first and the second player that reaches a given space gets that amount of gold. In the game end, the first player in a given resource takes 3x the number showing in the die for that resource; the second place takes 1x. The Abbot track doesn't have this multiplier and only gives the amount printed in the board when the spaces are reached and nothing more.

As I said, [thing=122943][/thing] offers a solid amount of game and choices in a short playing time (around 30 minutes). The auctions work well, and the decisions, though not really all that hard, sometimes aren't easy - you must usually consider what you leave for the next players, not only what you are getting.

This game has been called [thing=34219][/thing] with actual dice roll, but I found them really apart from each other. S&S isn't, at least for me, Biblios The Dice Game. A game collection can (as mine does) have both, and one won't step in the toes of the other all that much (though, both are played in roughly the same time and are basically of the same weight, so, in this sense, one will occupy the same spot for "fillers with meat").

The only downside for [thing=122943][/thing] is that the bits for it are subpar: the dice for the resources aren't etched, the board and cards are majorly bad (the money cards are simply terrible). But, even with this, I'm glad that I picked this one up. A really fun filler.

***

Lowered the rating after a few plays without a single auction for the resource dice. This is really the "it" that spice the game up and without it the gameplay seems to be lacking in emotion.

One of the best 2 player dice games I've ever played. Seems best with no more than 3. For more I'd pick Biblios instead.

Mechanically a terrific game.  Kind of reminds me of Ra: The Dice Game, but the auctions add a new intensity.  I wish it was more thematic.  This game begs for a good artist to evoke the theme.

Clever little dice choosing game with an auction. Five colored tracks players start at the bottom. Starting bid money. Try to win the color tracks with the highest multiplier die.  Original Biblios. Roll the special dice and each player chooses a subset from the combinations of resources, gold, or modifier. Cool "buy the pot" auction.  A little dry. Quick game.

Not much theme to this game, but still enjoyed this as a filler. As a 2 player game, this falls short.

good dice game, same gaming 'space' as "Ra the Dice Game", feels like there's a bit less control here though, point gaps can be swingy with the small tactical chaos choices

Bought this to replace Biblios. Less cards, same feel, I hope.

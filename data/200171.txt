Legendary meets one of my most favorite movies. Co-op deckbuilding and a lot of fun. But lets be honest: the artwork is abysmal and it makes playing the game less fun.

RATING: N/A
Wackier and more "take that" than its parent game. Perhaps suffers from being based on a film without that many characters, which can be seen from the fact that one of the characters is Kurt Russell in a disguise he wears for two minutes of screen time, and one is his truck(!)

RATING: 4
Gets the feeling of the movie fairly close.

The Legendary engine is just half the game the Legendary Encounters engine is, and unfortunately L:BTiLC amps up all the aspects of the Legendary engine I don't like.

In spite of stating 1 player on the box this does not play solo like the Lengendary Encounter games. You can play it with two hands, but it is designed for 2 or more players. The game is co-op with a little versus mixed in. You loose as a group, but win as an individual. 

There are community made solo rules available for the Legendary Marvel series. They work with this game and are really fun. You can find "The Golden Solo Ruleset" here:

Considering this is all based around a single film, I'd say it does a good job of converting Big Trouble to the Legendary universe. This version of the game is NOT an 'Encounters' title, so it's not quite as rich as Aliens, Firefly or Predator, and it also has more of a competitive 'take that' angle than the normal Legendary Marvel. The art is also a little uneven here, though more consistent than Firefly.

That said, you can still mix this in with other Legendary sets, and it's pretty cool.

My first legendary, and wow is this thing MEH! No solo rules (whats the 1-5 on the box then??), need a coin not in the box (minor gripe). Atrocious artwork, assuming they didnt get rights to likenesses or something because everything is just wrong. Gameplay is really really boring trying to play two handed solo. I love deckbuilding and deck construction, but as my first introduction to Legedary this is really bad.

Fun. Played the first scenario and I immediately set up for a match against David Lo Pan in the Wing Kong Exchange. If you love the movie and enjoy deckbuilding games, you will enjoy. Being new to Legendary, it took me a few plays to get the hang of things, but now I see that this is a pretty strategic game once you see what you're up against and know how each hero functions.

Giving it a 1-star rating because the box says it is for 1-5 players, so I bought it primarily to have an additional solo game to play. Turns out it does not in fact offer a single player option, and only supports 2-5 players.

RATING: 7
Overall a fun game.  
We removed the competitive element, as I really want to play a cooporative game.
I don't like the idea of Semi-cooporative games.
Still, I had a lot of fun over several games beating all the bosses and my most recent playthrough was a mashup of the BTiLC set with heroes and other cards added from some Marvel sets.
That was a LOT of fun.

So it's legendary, which is a pretty good, no-frills deck building experience.  The draw of this should always be the trappings and I think they've done exceedingly well on that front.  The artwork is unevenly campy, and the card abilities, titles, etc are all excellent call-backs.

About as good a screen to board translation as you'll find.  Since the movie itself is wall-to-wall famous lines, and the cards contain those, it's a must have for fanatics of the film.

RATING: 4
I have thoroughly enjoyed the Legendary series of games, but Big Trouble in Little China just did hit it for me. I think part of that is the theme, but most of it is just because of how the cards interact with each other. The interactions made it more difficult to build cohesive decks than is possible in other versions of Legendary.

Apart from some card names, this game has no flavor or fluff from the movie.  It is a non-collectible card game.  The rules are terrible.  Setting up the first game takes most of an hour to sort and meticulously go through the rulebook to figure out which of the 20 different kinds of cards go into which  of 7 different stacks.  You might get this down to 15 minutes or a third longer than it takes to set up the original Axis & Allies.  There are more  spaces on the play mat which aren't labeled.  They may be for discard stacks.  The mat is durable and does endure​ being folded up in the box but a long box would have been nicer.  There is a ton of room for more cards if I wanted to play superheroes mixed with action movie cards but I guarantee that will NEVER happen.  I would play again but none of my current group will ever be willing to try it a second time.  Now, it will sit and wait for it to go out of print in 6 months so the e-bay value will allow me to break even on the deal.

card abilities are uninspired and lazily key off other cards for "theme". The more interactive style clashes hard with the semi-cooperative nature. Not for me.

Great game. Seems to bridge the gap between Legendary Encounters and Legendary by adding "Mediocre Heroes." Interesting concept, keeps the danger and excitement fast paced and tense, and I'd like to see more Legendary/Legendary Encounters like this and less mundane feeling like Firefly.

As much as I love both Legendary Marvel and Alien, this one will be my forever game for Legendary.  [i]Big Trouble in Little China[/i] is among my favorite movies (top 3 for sure).  The mechanics enhance the theme.  It is 90+% compatible with the Marvel sets.  It does have, again, some of Legendary's drawbacks: longer than average set-up/tear-down, 3 players is the sweet spot, and the rules can be a little daunting to new players.  This is my new favorite for the Legendary series.

RATING: 6.5
Semi-cooperative game, with some personal goals determining an overall winner. These cannot be removed without losing the drive for a lot of actions.

We played a couple of games, the starter setup against Six-Shooter and then one against David Lo-Pan.

We enjoyed it enough that we will certainly play again, but it's not entirely a cooperative game. We decided we would not score between players, just play against the Big Bad (like Sentinels of the Multiverse, for example) when it's just the two of us. However, this reduces the interest of the endgame phase.

The graphic design could be fine-tuned for better legibility, and the art is only so-so. The rule book is usable, but I wish it was clearer.

Replay value is good; discovering how various decks interact, and forming strategies based on synergies provides a lot of interest.

RATING: 5
A rather weak twist on the Legendary system. Not horrible and if you like Legendary and like the movie you'll likely still enjoy the game for an occasional play but the game simply is not on the level with the other games in the series. If you don't like one or the other you won't like it at all. 

The game itself is to much on the easy side. I was hoping for something similar to Legendary Alien Encounters in terms of difficulty. So far we've had little difficulty winning the game. 

The artwork is a huge disappointment. Most of the characters bear little resemblance to the actors in the film. I don't know if they couldn't get the rights to the actual images of the actors or what but the cards of Jack Burton, Gracy Law and even Eddie look nothing like the actors.

In terms of production values Upper Deck went cheapo yet again. They didn't package the game in a box big enough to roll the game mat up in like Alien Encounters or Villains, Instead they decided to pinch a few pennies at it's customer's expense and package the game in a smaller box. You have to fold the game mat to fit it in it which over time will wreck it. Thus you need to go out and buy some sort of tube to store the game's playing mat in separately. Really cheap.

Let me start off by saying that the theme doesn't do anything for me. I wasn't that big a fan of the movie, but as is usually the case, I almost always inevitably get all things Legendary. That all having been said, I like this game. It adds in a few things I'm a fan of, while having a few bumps in the road in the process. For instance, starting off the game with two random unique starting cards is interesting, and I like that the board has a section to represent Chinatown. At the same time, it does feel a little odd that they went with the same city layout as Marvel Legendary, and ultimately this feels more like a re-skin of that game rather than its own version of the system. They also didn't include much in the box as far as villains go, but it's still pretty surprising how much content they got out of a single movie. Lastly, I find the fact that there are more cards for two of the characters than what you'll use in each game to be a pretty big nit-pick. I don't like having to pick and choose which cards I use for these characters if they're involved. Otherwise I really like this set. It should implement nicely with my Marvel stuff, even if combining them is a bit odd, thematically-speaking.

I loved this movie when it came out. I was a kid then and used to create all sorts of fanfic play based on the movie — more than with almost any other movie I've ever seen.  I've played Legendary and I kind of liked it, but it wasn't my favorite game. With this theme, however, it could win. This game doesn't look as good to me as the new BTiLC game hitting the Hotness now, but is still appealing

As I've stated elsewhere, Upper Deck has broken new deck-building ground with its Legendary Encounters games (Alien, Predator, Firefly).  The Encounters system is a cooperative, thematically oriented upgrade to base Legendary - with narrative events, storyline goals, etc. - and it works well.

I say this because [i]Big Trouble in Little China[/i] is NOT an Encounters game.  It's the same old vanilla Legendary, but in a universe populated by action humor, catchy one-liners, and radiant green sorcery.  If the movie didn't do anything for you, your funny bone may have been dampened under the weight of your furrowed brow. Egg Shen will prescribe the medication that you need.
 
There are minor differences between Big Trouble and base Marvel Legendary, such as: two randomly selected "mediocre" heroes in players' starting decks, each with unique and highly specific powers; a Chinatown area of the city; a significant increase in player interaction (e.g., forcing other players to discard or destroy cards); and the now strictly enforced Final Showdown rule.  I'm impressed with how the designer managed to squeeze 12 different schemes out of 99 movie minutes, but squeeze he did. And any game with a playable Pork Chop Express gets a thumbs up in my book.

This is my first introduction to the Legendary series.  I circled around the base game several times but couldn't resist the lure of one of my favorite movies.  I'm enjoying it a lot more than I expected to and enough to start saving for the Marvel game and its expansions.  I love cooperative games and this fits the bill nicely.

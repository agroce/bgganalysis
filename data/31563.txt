The combat card system is way cool, but playing the game as the heroes feels a lot like playing Arkham Horror. You go around the board collecting [-]clues[/-] favor and then go to Sauron's [-]open gates[/-] current plots and spend favor to [-]seal[/-] cancel them. The encounter deck idea seems to be straight from AH, too. End of turn: Sauron opens a new plot at Dol-Goldur; a new clue appears at Bree; the [-]doom-track[/-] plot-track advances. :p There's even a final battle between a hero and the ring wraiths in AH style. I'm not complaining too hard, though; I [i]like[/i] AH. (I was just surprised at the highly similar feeling)

"Favor" is a bit too abstract, though. It feels more like you're going around collecting signatures for petitions to Sauron to stop his evil, and then you go to the plot locations and present your collected signatures to discard the evil plot.

RATING: 8.5
Adventure, not battle, is the focus with this title. The mechanic of the life pool, rest pool, and damage pool with the same deck of character cards is a redeeming one. There are excruciatingly difficult risk/reward decisions throughout... it's actually two games in one, as the Sauron player has their own rules.

Very interesting... got a chance to demo this with the developer at GenCon. It hits the table often, actually.

Also, after any play of this, I typically spend the next three or four days with excellent game ideas quite unrelated to this game. There's something here that stimulates the creative side of my brain in some manner.

Really epic game, I actually quite enjoy the combat mechanic.

RATING: 6
Through one play as Sauron, I'm not certain as to whether I actually beat the Free Peoples in my victory or not.  Big disconnect with respect to player interaction on each turn.  Asymmetric game play is fine, but co-operative games should more respect to a team plan; I mean, wow- FP players can give one another gear, and that's it.  No combat support.  No assisting to defeat a location; it's all down to "I give you my horse".  A four player game is more akin to three separate games of solitaire being played from out of the same deck.

Meanwhile, as Sauron, it's not necessarily your cunning plan that is winning, but the luck of drawing key plot cards that fit your current pool size.  With the right plot cards out (even in region 1), victory was basically assured in a scant 5-6 turns.  

Not impressed.  FFG has better titles managing as many things on the table or more, with faster gameplay and a much higher level of player interaction (see Warrior Knights).  I'll give it another go, but if it doesn't play better on round two, it will definitely be up for trade.

Pick up and deliver with a Tolkien theme. Ok, this is a very simplified view on the game but essentially that is what you do. Of course there is a number of thematic twists you call random events with a few occasional fights with the minions of Sauron.

The playability of the game is of typical Fantasy Flight Games level, i.e., poor. This is due to the zillion moving pieces and heavy setup. Moreover, the downtime is a big problem. To make things worse, most of the time is spent on administrative tasks rather than making decisions. In other words, Middle-Earth Quest offers very little to maintain players' interest between turns. This is a shame since the game looks absolutely fantastic. 

I also liked that the game does not involve the characters from Lord of the Rings or Hobbit books. This not that I dislike the story (on the contrary I love 'em), but the games made on the theme need a fresh take. MEQ could have provided this but the poor playability absolutely kills the game.

Never again, I reckon.

Love the theme. Original mechanics. Partly coop, with one player becoming Sauron and taking on 1-3 heroes. The artwork is exceptional.

RATING: 3
Pros:
- Good components and graphics.
- Interesting combat system.
- Most game mechanic support theme.

Cons:
- Game takes up to 6 hours for 10 turns.
- Main mechanic is not well themed but feels like: Run around, collect and pay tokens.
- Lots of decisions with no direct effect on game end.
- Too much information not written on board or sheets, but to keep in mind.
- Close to fully separate player moves, i.e. no interaction. between players.

Middle-Earth Quest的背境是在一個黑暗力量逐漸強大的時候。時間是比爾博巴金斯於第一百一十一歲生辰時離開夏爾後過了約十年，就是佛羅多帶著魔戒從夏爾出發的前幾年。其間，魔王索倫的力量在魔多日益壯大，勢將席捲中土，精靈族漸次遠走白色彼岸，東方南方的人類已向魔多稱臣，更有謠言洛汗國為妄想的和平向魔多進貢馬匹，只有米那斯提力斯的居民與少數北方遊俠仍奮力抵抗... 尚有灰袍巫師甘道夫，鍥而不捨地追查肯定魔戒的證據和前魔戒持有者咕嚕的下落，也拜託了一些英雄保護夏爾、穿梭中土號召各地僅餘的力量，一同參與破壞索倫的計劃，直到魔戒遠征隊出發，觸發魔戒大戰及第三紀元的結束。
Middle-Earth Quest的玩家將扮演英雄角色，如勇於冒險的哈比人，剛鐸國的隊長，來自西山的騎士等等；不單進入魔戒的原有傳奇，也透過新的角色重新經驗中土世界裡的冒險，而不必約束於原有角色的既定命運。

RATING: 6
It is an epic adventure game based on The Lord of the Rings universe, where up to three heroes team up to get ahead of Sauron who always tries to plot something and to gain influence in Middle-Earth. The heroes solve quests, gather favour (which appears randomly every turn) to foil Sauron's plots. Then they battle the evil monsters and minions and interact with special characters (mainly those from the boooks). It is a hard game especially for Sauron's side, but it does not take that long to complete. The drawback as with other adventure is, that it is card driven so there is always a lot of text to read in order to be able to decide on future moves.  Taking account the setting, there should be more need for cooperation between heroes.

I enjoyed this game very much, from the lord of the rings theme, this is almost the best I've known, my favorite on this theme is War of the Ring, but MEQ is close. Good mechanics and theme, I loved the way the battle works, very clever. It is a shame FFG stopped to focus on this game.

RATING: 6
Might be a fine game, but takes too long to play for the level of enjoyment.  Also has the unfortunate Fantasy Flight tendency to include one or two too-many rules/aspects of play to track, making strategic play as hero rely on a fairly complex understanding, unfortunately limited by hand settings.  Perhaps more importantly, two player mission balance has big issues, and playing two heroes is annoying.

Rated after two plays. This will definitely see more table time. Has only played as Sauron both times, as I have been the Lord of the Rules as well as the rings.

Playing as Sauron is all about hand-management and long-term planning. Playing as the heroes seems to be more straight forward.

The card mechanic is genius, I really like how battles are solved. The encounter cards also favor the side that is behind on the score track, therefore making the game closer and tenser. The only negative is that the final battle seems a bit anticlimactic after spending two to three hours building up.

The game is highly thematic, and with time it might wear of. But for now, I really love this game.

Great LOTR themed game with innovative card mechanics. Plays out almost like Arkham Horror lite with one player taking on the bad guy role. Also, amazing miniatures and production value.

This game didn't work out quite as well for me because
- long setup and playing time, fiddly components, rules galore (main reasons)
- use of unknown characters for the good guys

My personal preferences aside, I do recognize that this is a good game at its core. It is just not for me.

Es un gran juego de aventuras. Puede parecer muy lento y farragoso a simple vista pero una vez comienzas a jugar los turnos fluyen de una manera bastante rápida y adictiva. Muchas veces dan ganas de hacer cosas o visitar lugares simplemente para ver que ocurre o ver la cara que pone el jugador "Sauron" cuando desbaratas un plan que lleva varios turnos preparando discretamente...

A diferencia de otros juegos de aventuras como Runebound aquí hay un jugador que hace de enemigo (Sauron) y que tiene que cumplir con sus propios objetivos secretos. Sauron puede farolear, colocar trampas en el camino o incluso perseguir y atacar a los heroes con sus hordas de monstruos y lugartenientes. Eso hace que cada aventura sea mucho más interesante y desafiante que las que ofrecen los encuentros aleatorios de Runebound.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Immersive theme that's well thought-out; plays well, though long and slow--not a bad thing in my book as long as it's not dull, which this is not; endgame is the game's weakness--either comes too suddenly (and anti-climactically) or ends with a distinctly non-epic one-on-one battle which undermines the co-operative play--use a variant! REPLACED IN COLLECTION WITH LOTR LCG--no endgame issues to break the thematic immersion.

RATING: 3
Being a big fan of War of the Ring, Arkham Horror, and Fury of Dracula I was really looking forward to this game, and I was surprised how disappointed I was.  The production values were great, as expected, but the game felt boring, overly-complex, and meaningless.

I played as one of the heroes, and I suspect that things are more interesting for Sauron.  We also probably played with too many heroes (3) which made downtime much worse.  I might try it again under more ideal circumstances, but I can't imagine it being that much better.

Underneath the layers and layers of game mechanics, the typical hero turn is to walk to a nearby spot and, hopefully, pick up a token of some sort.  Sometimes when you have enough of them you walk to a Sauron spot and cash them in.  In between all of this you might get into a fight against an overly-matched monster.  Then you push hero cards blindly against Sauron's monster cards and hope to defeat the monster quickly.  And you get events which give you tokens or take them away.

It felt a lot like Runebound or Touch of Evil.  There's an entire world to explore but one place is as good as another and there's not really any meaningful choices to be made.  You're just a token collector.

Then your turn is over and there's nothing to do while the other heroes do the same thing.  The game is cooperative, but there's not much interaction between heroes other than occasionally pooling their tokens.  And then you wait while Sauron goes and collects cards and puts tokens back on the board.

It's all rules and activity and waiting and endless tokens and cards, but I didn't find any engaging decisions to be made.

-------------------

It seemed to have so much potential so I tried again with just two heroes to limit downtime.  It was just as boring and pointless, and we thankfully stopped halfway through.  I gave the game away. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Played it twice.  The mechanics are alright, nothing terribly exciting (although the mechanics for a battle are pretty well done, I think).  The end game is still very anticlimactic, almost stupidly so.  The big thing is that the game is just VERY dull.  If you're a hero, you take your turn doing something that may or may not really matter (Depending on the missions).  And really all the things you can do are different kinds of pointless.  Go pick up favor.  Go stand here to make him lose influence.  Go fight a monster.  Whoo :-\

RATING: 9
Only played once as Sauron but while it was a longer
game than I expected (partly because we had to het used to the above average rules complexity-wise) it was a great immersive experience full of epic drama.
The best experience I had so far on boardgame-form of the Tolkien mythology. Mechanics are smartly interwoven with the theme with a special mention  of the simple brilliance of the wat the hero-deck works and the subtle management it takes to control it well.
Combat is also tactical, fast and involving.
An absolute safe buy for adventure fans with a slight reservation overall, not knowing if playing a hero is quite as rich as putting on the helmet of the Dark lord. It seems that the other side is a little less rich judging the reactions of the other players. Rating therefore might lower or stay fixed. Have to wait and see...

Nice and dripping with theme.  What I've figured out is that the rest of my game group likes these games with a lot of theme more than I do.

It's the rest of the players against Sauron.

Disappointing. Owned it a long time ago, sold after patterns of play began clearly visible, every game was too predictable because of how the bad guy needs to play his cards. Very poor balance and feel of adventure once you figure out the game (and it's not really that hard), which is really sad, because some mechanics (especially the brilliant combat, health and travelling system) were such a joy.

Oh dear.  What a lot of bits and rules.  A tedious set up followed by a tedious fiddly game.  The individual player quests proved not too difficult, but happily the other players were happy to call it a day when it was clear Sauron would win (after 3 or so hours and still a quarter of the game to go).  The one brief highlight was when my character did battle.  At last a few moments player interaction and the combat system was nicely handled.  There are much more enjoyable ways of spending time.  Yes, the graphics were good (but not as good as METW) and the plastic bits very nice.  Thankfully there are cheaper ways of getting nice miniatures.

Very good adventure game where the Free People heroes are trying their hardest to thwart Sauron's plans and stop him advancing his plot. It's a shame FFG hasn't supported it at least a little bit more. Using unknown heroes didn't help either. It's similar to Eldritch Horror but instead of full co-op, one player plays the bad guys. Hopefully FFG brings it back one day.

I would never mind playing the baddy in this one, the only thing keeping me from doing so is its long playtime, which my friends do turn down more often than not. Great theme, I get a kick out of the flavor in the cards, really clever mechanisms, even the baddy does not know exactly what is going on on the board and whether he'll win or not (although that is somewhat bound to change as players get to know each others' objectives and hidden win conditions and get a pretty good idea what their opponents are trying to do.

This is an excellent game! I don't know how to classify it: the best I could say is that it's an accurate thematic representation of the events in middle earth as we know of them. The thematic incorporation in the mechanics is the best I've seen in a game. It also has excellent and balanced assymetrical play between Sauron and the heroes with innovative combat mechanics and other hidden secrets that provide ground for the Sauron player to be cunning and thus, provide a replayable challenge.
You can feel the mechanics and strategies work in parallel with your intuition from the books or the movies, without comprosing the gameplay not even a bit.
It is the best Ameritrash game I've played so far.

This is a very fun game.  Up to three players play as one of the Free Peoples' heros and a fourth player takes on the role of the evil Sauron.  It is very fun to play as either faction and the more I've played it the more I've come to realize the game's balance.

I don't like adventure games but this is probably the best one I played. I like the mechanic with the cards you use being at the same time your life - every card you play means one less life point. I love the way the fights take place, it is much more interesting than any other battle mechanic I know.

Still, I'm not sure if the quests are balanced - some seem very easy (have a number of Scrolls at the end of the game), some seem much harder (only two monster tokens on the board at the end of the game). But I didn't play enough to make strong opinions on this.

I would be happy to play it more often if it didn't take so much time. You should count at least 1 hour for each player, probably a bit more.

A game with so little interaction i scarcely believe they can call it cooperative.  With 4 players the downtime is totally unbearable.

On the positive it does give you a chance to be the bad guys and stick it to the heroes big time.  However they can usually avoid combat if they want to.

Currently this game is the epitome of the 'fantasy questing' genre. Regarding game mechanics it easily beats predecessors like 'World of Warcraft the Adventure Game', 'World of Warcraft the Board Game', 'Prophecy', 'Runebound' and of course 'Talisman' (which is the simplest of the lot). The hero players and the Sauron player play different games: The hero players mainly play a card game and try to optimize solving quests/detroying plots and battle monsters while the Sauron player tries to build up influence and gain more power for advanced plots.
It has a lot less luck than the other games mentioned above and the balancing is well done. As always with FFG, the gamne pieces are great (sturdy cards, nice game board) to excellent (great miniatures!).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I probably like this game mostly because of the Lord of the Rings theme, otherwise it falls into a category of mostly FFG games that I do not enjoy: big and full of a million pieces. I need to play as Sauron, I suspect I would enjoy that challenge better. As the heroes the decisions are typically not as challenging and there is significant down time in the 4 player game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fantastic Game, full of variation and adventure which truly captures the Middle Earth theme. However the winning side is pretty much determined by opening plays, where the Sauron player can almost always win if they start their plots early and efficiently. I would rather a fully cooperative version of this to keep it in my collection.

A LOTR fan's dream! This is a beautiful game that is just dripping with theme. Mechanically, it is sort of like a competitive Arkham Horror. I have taught this to 2 different groups (playing Sauron each time) and they both really enjoyed it. The card combat system takes a little bit of getting used to, but it's not too hard. As Sauron, you are really  just trying to slow down the players enough so that you are strong enough for the final battle. I really need to get this to the table again...

The asymmetric nature of it is great. You get a lot of stories to tell after a single game and each session with this one has proven to be a memorable one. The mechanics are smart, it is soaked in theme, simply an amazing game.

Would probably get a 10 in my book, if not for the lengthy setup and the gameplay time.

Packed with theme this game can really grab you. But only if you let it. Gameplay is pretty smooth for a relatively complex game. Bits look outstanding. The issue with the brittle mini's is being sorted so no complaints there. The only beef I have with the game after one play is that the fight in the end was a real anti-climax for me. I hope they will find a better tiebreaker than this battle in the inevitable expansion. The expansion seems also necessary because of the rather limited event card selection.

I love playing the game, like the mechanics, love the board, love the theme.  BUT~  In one of the strangest design decisions I can recall, unless one side outright "wins", the game essentially comes down to a coin flip of "who can draw the better hand?".  My wife played an excellent villain once, we invested 3 hours into the game, and in the end for the final battle, I drew the nuts and she didn't.  gg?

I feel ripped off when we invest so much time for such a disappointing ending.  Otherwise, I love it, but boy does that leave a bad taste in your mouth.

Boring, dull and dry: Middle-Earth Quest feels like an attempt at exploiting a trendy theme rather than a thematically appealing game on its own.

Although player turns are short and downtime heavy, not a pleasant feature themselves, what really annoys me is this game’s core mechanics: there’s no dice to roll, no randomness whatsoever, only cards to draw and play that decide everything you’re allowed to do in a turn.
The worst is reserved for the combat though: since it is card-driven, just like everything else in the game, whenever two characters collide there’s no suspense or luck involved, it’s just an attempt at outguessing your opponent in the hope the cards you still have in both your hand and deck are enough to endure the fight.

Rolling dice and in case adding a card or two to improve or mitigate the results would have been a much better solution.

One of the best adventure games I've played in a long, long time.  The fact that the Heroes' game is completely different from Sauron's game makes it really interesting, and it's the pinnacle of "never have enough turns/time/resources to do what I want to do".  Excellent choices, really thematic events in the game, and there are constant challenges to be overcome by both sides.

The one and only thing I don't like about the game is the completely arbitrary and tacked on Showdown With the Nazgul that decides the ending in about half the games.  WTF?  There has to have been a better way than this.

Very enjoyable Middle-Earth adventure game! There are more interesting movement, advancement, and combat decisions to make than in several other popular adventure games. I think this is a step up over Runebound and even Arkham Horror. While not quite as immersive as Tales of the Arabian Nights, there is a contest between the Sauron Player and the Adventurers that gives the game a singular focus. 

Update: Upgraded to an 8. I should add that there are no dice in this game. While the cards do offer some randomness, players are nearly always offered or are directed to choose from _at least_ three cards. The Life Deck is also a fantastic development. Throughout the game, a character's abilities ebbs and flows with his overall health. It affects how they'll perform in a fight or in a pinch. Vastly superior to the way Arkham Horror handles this. This is different for each character and to a degree for each minion. This is one adventure game that really allows players to develop concrete strategies and succeed or fail by their decisions.

This game comes packed with theme.  Nice mechanics although after only one solo play I found it difficult as Sauron moving monsters and minions around while trying to get the correct plot cards to advance his story tokens.  Also the smaller deck sizes make me wonder about replayability after a few games.  I think if brought out occasionally this game is a must have for any LOTR fans, but if you want to play it over and over, I am not sure at this point.  Overall I am happy with it and am looking forward to a 4 player game.

Great, epic game but loooooong. Our first game took 6 (six!) hours. We were into it the whole time but...damn, that's a long game. Friends say we can get it down to 3 but even that's a longish game. Components, rules, and theme are fantastic though. Loved playing it and the length is the only thing that will keep me playig it more often than once every couple of months or so.

RATING: 7
This is a fun but epic (long), semi-cooperative (1-versus-many) game of secret missions and hand management.  The game takes a long time to learn from scratch (because the rulebook is lengthy and disorganized), but overall it's pretty easy and straight-forward once you figure it out.  There is a lot of deck-versus-deck combat so repeated plays and familiarity with the different combat decks should enhance the enjoyment and strategy in the game.

Game Summary:  Each side (good & evil) want to accomplish their secret mission before the game timer runs out (which happens when plot markers have advanced to a certain level on the plot track).  If neither side fulfills their mission, the evil player and 1 good player have a final battle to decide the winner.

Others say:  anti-climactic ending (which makes sense since ending the game with a duel after playing for several hours feels abrupt)

RATING: 8
This is a very good - if not great - game. It's fun to have the semi-cooperative adventure in Middle-Earth but the characters seem pretty two dimensional and don't develop much. The Sauron role seems to be a little more fun but strong play accidentally thwarted by the hero players doesn't seem to be rewarded more than mediocre play. The card based combat is inventive and fun (and suited for this game - unlike Dungeonquest). At any time players have a number of decisions that can determine the direction of the game's narrative. It's an interesting grab bag of different mechanics that almost pull off cohesion. However, the irresistable theme for me pulls it all together satisfyingly enough to make this a game I enjoy playing.

RATING: 7
While I like the idea of adventure games, pretty much all of them that I've played have left me feeling a little cold.  I have no problem with dice, but this is a genre RULED by dice.  There's no strategy, you are just at the complete mercy of the dice and/or other random mechanics.  Middle-Earth Quest fixes that.  It took a few plays, but I can now say that I really do love this game.  I have no need for any other game of this type.  It's the best.  Simple as that.

I'm giving it a 9.  I don't think it will go down, but it might go up with a few more plays.

RATING: 5
After a few plays there are things I quite like about this game and things I really don't like.  I enjoy the game's mechanics such as the card pools, influence and the like, but a few flaws are going to keep this one from becoming a regular on the table.  The lack of variety of quests, encounters and missions is somewhat bothersome, it makes the games feel the same as you're playing them and that you'll need an expansion to 'complete' the game.  The major flaw to me is how the finale works.  If you're dominant and complete your mission, great, you win.  No problems there.  If you're dominant and don't complete your mission, you fight the ringwraiths, which may be more or less powerful in the final fight.  This is just bloody awful.  It's like playing a game for two hours, then playing another 5 minute game to determine the winner.  I can't express how unsatisfying this is, and I feel that it's something that cripples the entire experience of the game.  I really wanted to like this game but the finale just hurts the experience so much I can't recommend it.

I suspect I'll try it a few more times with various people, but we have more attractive options.

I've had to reduce my rating of this game.  It's an 8/10 game with a just TERRIBLE end-game scenario stapled to it (the Ringwraith battle) that the entire game suffers terribly for it.  I have trouble comprehending why one should play MEQ for 2.5 hours, then decide the winner of the game by playing a hand of poker or perhaps a rousing round of jump-rope instead of allowing the events of the game to determine the winner.  That's how bad the Ringwraith battle is to me.  I wanted to love this game, and I was quite enamoured with it right up until I realized how awful winning/losing due to the Ringwraith battle was.  If the rest of the game was not so good this would be rated even lower.

To be clear, I really like the game, but the ending was a dealbreaker.  For the purposes of Blott's geeklist, it fits BOTH criteria.  I like the game, but I hate the luck based bs at the end of the game. :)

Great, but only playable with 2 heroes and Sauron. The game is greatly unbalanced with the 2 or 4 player rules (in favour of the heroes and Sauron respectively). Playable with 2 players if 1 player controls 2 heroes: turns have to be taken clockwise anyway, and the information the heroes silently share this way is not a gamebreaker.

RATING: 9
Provisional rating, based on one play. Usual Fantasy Flight big box game - (overly?) complicated rule book, fiddly rules and long game play, that improves with familarity/repeat playings. Heavy in theme. The companion to War of the Ring, this time focusing on the characters and quests rather than military action. 

Like it, but flaws might appear with repeat playings.

-- Update, played twice now and still like it, and want to play it. As I'm getting familar with the game system more depth is apparent, and I like the way (certainly as Sauron, haven't played hero yet) the theme interlinks with the mechanics, I feel like I'm plotting to take over Middle Earth and the heroes are very irritating running around thwarting me at every step. Need to play as the heroes to see if experience is as good!

-- Update #2, Now played 5 times and experienced both Sauron and Hero. Sauron is very strategic, Hero is more a case of reacting to what Sauron is doing and working out the priorities for doing stuff. Still like it, but feel it is crying out for an  expansion with more characters, more cards (or rather replacement cards) etc.

Fans of Lightweight Euro games are going to hate this, luck (card draw), conflict, and long playtime ...

Played this and as usual FF suffers from the rules being somewhat hard to locate and memorize.

They always have needed better player's aids and also corss referencing.

The over production is completely awesome, it is one of the prettiest games that I have seen.

There are subtly placed rules which if missed DRAMATICALLY effect the outcome so beware.  Check every single part of the game the first couple of times through.


There are some incredible balancing factors to the games that surprise me each time I play.

RATING: 4.5
This game has some great ideas, like the combat system and the plot cards.  It also seems incredibly well-balanced, which normally is a good thing.  But in this case, three of the four games I have played have come down to the Ringwraith showdown which is anti-climactic after a three hour game.  My understanding is that this happens about half the time.  So the massive downtime and victory conditions spoil this game for me somewhat.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
ME:Q is a big question mark in my book.  On paper it should be greatness.  The design has made several choices that seem nothing short of inspiried. (Asymetrical sides, hero's actions and vitality are governed by their deck of cards, a combat system that hearkens back to Magic Realm, etc)  Add in the ususal FFG production values and this should be on my top 10 games list right?

Well so far it isn't and no matter how much I want it to be *that* game, it just falls flat.

What's the problem?  Well with 4 players ME:Q has too much downtime making it boring and slow.  Last time we played with 4, we packed up the game midway to play something else.  Also if the Sauron player isn't really profficient and evil, the players will have too easy a time winning.

So am I ready to close the book on ME:Q?  Not yet.  I'd like to give it 1 or 2 more tries.  First with only 3 players and second with a Suron player that really knows his stuff.  Maybe then ME:Q will deliver the big payoff in fun that it's supposed to.

Juego ambientado en el universo tolkien, con mecánicas que ya he probado en otros juegos, como Arkam horror o descent. Es un juego colaborativo en el que un jugador toma el papel de Sauron, y los demás jugadores tienen que utilizar sus personajes para ir echando abajo sus planes. Tiene un interesante sistema de cartas.. en las que una sola carta sirve para resolver combates, simbolizar la vida del personaje y moverte por el mapa. En eso es bastante original...  El diseño y calidad del juego, como es habitual con fantasy flight games, están cuidados al detalle.

Did a first test play to get into the game.
It is a lot of rules to grasp, even if the game flow is quite simple and intuitiv.

Looks like this is a very good game.

Played through the game on my own. It was a very tight game, which was won by the heroes.

There are a lot of things to focus on all the time in the game. This make it quite easy to miss things as you play.
Think this is more about being new to the game, and will be easier after some games.

Amazing components.  Art is so-so, for a fantasy game the art is absolutely some of the best, for a Tolkien game - with so much original flavoursome artwork to channel, the artwork is merely ok, while the graphic design could learn a lot from Nexus' excellent work on War of the Ring.  Gameplay looks very interesting - can't wait to play.

Played - A thoroughly interesting and thematic game.

I like the various interlocking elements to this game.  I am still not sold on the design and look of the game, but the various aspects work very well together.  Sauron and the Heroes both offer very different experiences and challenges.  This is a game that rewards replay, as players become more familiar with manipulating the various cogs that operate this game it becomes deeper and more engrossing.

However, my ultimate feeling is - if you are looking for a flavour of Middle Earth, you still cannot pass by Nexus' and FFG's wonderful War of the Ring.

Update:

After some thought.  I found Middle Earth Quest to have some really interesting aspects - the adventure aspect, quests, influence, Sauron's action mechanism, the travel/rest/healing system... however, the game just feels overly ponderous, with too many additional mechanisms seeking to add chrome.  I love Middle Earth, and am interested in Middle Earth games, sadly though I think many of FFGs games have a bloated feel to them, a ponderous complexity that needlessly adds fiddly detail at the expense of a cleaner game.  

To my mind something like Claustrophobia is the sort of game that typifies a good balance between mechanical complexity and theme.  I love many of FFGs games, but when I think of Claustrophobia I can't help thinking that if FFG had published it, it would have exhaustion rules, encounter cards for different terrain types, equipment cards with exhaustion limits and effects, different types of Trogs that act differently and have different combat strengths and weaknesses etc.  Underneath would still be a simple game, but the layers of complexity add a lot to the playing of the game without adding a lot to the gameplay - if that is an appropriate metaphor.  

This is how I feel about Middle Earth Quest, underneath there is a good and simple game that is evocative of the theme without trying to reproduce the minutea of the world, however, it is mired with layers of effects, additions, mechanics and so forth that add a lot to the set-up and playing of the game without adding a lot to the experience of the game play.  I like the game, I just don't think it's as good as it could be. Sometimes FFG seem to have the idea that adding extra chrome, extra rules, extra cards, extra effects and so forth adds extra to the experience of the theme - I don't think that is always the case.  It leads some of their games to feel a little ponderous imo - Middle Earth Quest feels this way to me.

Of all the fantasy themed games I've played, I like MEQ the best.  Fantasy is not my favorite theme, and most games in the genre (like Talisman or Runebound) I've found to be repetitious and tedious, fun only with plenty of beer.  RotH I like very much, but it is truly a (pick-up-and-deliver) Euro in disguise, so it might not count.  MEQ is fully Ameritrash goodness, with plenty of the creative mechanisms you would expect from Corey Konieczka.  Best of all, it has a "time-out" mechanism familiar to players of Runewars or Starcraft, so the game simply can't drag on for too long (I think 10 turns is the max).  This is very similar to Arkham Horror, although much less co-op, which suits me fine (although I'll take AH any day over this one theme-wise).  And unlike some games where playing the baddie can be a snooze (I'm looking at you, LNoE), playing as Sauron is actually fun!  Ashar's not in love with it, mostly because of the Tolkein trappings (I don't think the mechanics have quite clicked for her yet either), but it's good fun.  It'll probably come out less than RotH, but when you want a good old fantasy slog (that actually doesn't make you want to quit early) this is the one to reach for.

RATING: 7.5
You really need to be a Tolkien geek to love this game, which has so many people, places, events, and references to the books that the map and cards can be a little intimidating. Can you find Rhosgobel on a map of Mirkwood? Do you know the historical significance of Angmar? Did you know that Thranduil was Legolas's father? Luckily, I am a Tolkien geek, so no worries there!

In terms of gameplay, each side is so different that Sauron and the heroes actually play completely different games. The heroes just wander around having adventures, drawing cards, picking up items, and having the occasional battle. Sauron, on the other hand, is planning an epic, slow victory, timing his actions just right over several turns to try to spread his influence and prevent the heroes from foiling his plans. I'd even go so far as to say that the two sides actually appeal to different kinds of gamers. The heroes role seems better suited for an Ameritrash or even RPG gamer, where the Sauron role might be more attractive to people who like heavy strategy or wargames. It is a very good game with a wonderfully rendered theme. I just don't think it's for everyone. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
An "experience" game that is overwrougt and doesn't present any real decisions.  Downtime is massive also, as there's nothing I can do when it's not my turn other than stare at the board.  I appreciate story elements coming to life, but I just walked around, picked up little tokens, and went on my way to find more tokens.. which were all the same, and had no real flavor.  You don't even get a chance to really level up.

Overall, it was exactly what I expected out of this design team, and Fantasy Flight.  Can't say I'm dissapointed, I'm just hoping to be surprised one day.

Interesting game, but long (3+ hours).  The rules are verbose and not particularly well organized, so it takes a long time to work through them - but once you do the game flows fairly well.  The favor tokens feel a lot like the clue tokens from Arkham Horror (pop up randomly, used to banish evil).  The combat system is interesting.  Good game, but not great.

30.10.2012: Absolutely loved the game when it came out. Now it's a bit lame to see so little variety. The decks are way too small to keep you interested for more than 25 plays. Sadly a Expansion seems to be nowhere at the horizon. But none the less a Game with a interesting combat system, nice looking artwork, a clear storyline and a tendency to give you a photo finish (never had a problem with the end fight).

Keeping an eye out. This is the angle to take if you're going to Tolkien - the only truly successful Tolkien game, Middle Earth: The Wizards, took this tack. But Konieczka made a hash of BSG and Tide of Iron, and A Game of Thrones would have felt dated in the 80s, so there is no clear sign that he has any real idea what he's doing as a designer. So I'm not optimistic.

Fantastic adventure game with a bevy of interesting mechanisms. I do think it feels quite a bit bloated though, coming out in Corey K.'s hayday of a hundred individual card decks and multiple subsystems. 

I also think this game is much more engaging playing as Sauron than the heroes. You have more to do and more options to interact with. The heroes simply are bouncing around a map scooping up some things.

Even though the Theme is really played out, I quite enjoyed this outing in middle earth where we take on the role of made up characters and only interact with the story staples through the story the game tells.  It is on the longish side for a game that boils down into players fetching items and completing objectives while the one sauron player tries to stop them, but even still the fresh game mechanics and take on the LOTR universe makes me want to come back at this one for another go.

--after another play, I highly recommend playing with three heroes and three sauron actions. The game feels remarkably more balanced and fun.

Took us about 6 hours to learn and play.  It's a typical, heavy American style game from Fantasy Flight.  Detailed and specific rules kept us from having a smooth an easy first game and I imagine it would take us another 1 or 2 games to no longer consult the rulebook for minutia.  Enjoyable game, great thematic feel, but just felt a bit too underwhelming for me.  It's often difficult to know if your actions are really inhibiting the other player's success if your Sauron.  It seems like I would need 2 more games to really sink my teeth into the strategic options but at probably 3-4 hours, it didn't give me enough to warrant that many plays, especially given the quality of some 2 hours games in my collection.  Good game, an excellent American style game, not my type of game though.

one play as one of three heroes.  We (just barely) lost but really enjoyed ourselves.  In my experience one of the few beautiful and ergonomically well done FF games.

The best Middle Earth remains ICE's MECCG.

But something about the pacing feels a little off, as does the end game.  It is very thematic, though, and given that I love the setting, I'll certainly play this some more.

Epic, lavishly produced, asymmetric, thematic all vs 1 game. The combat mechanic is impressive and tense, one of the best ever. The spatial element of influence network is also quite interesting. Playing Sauron is a completely different experience, with very interesting mechanisms in itself. Very well design, clean, innovative and fresh even after 6 years, as of 2015.

There emerges a strong camaraderie among free peoples players, while the sense of doom increases turn by turn. This is an experience of a game, and one with very interesting decisions. It is not an efficiency or maximisation exercise, and the luck of the draw is welcome and spices up things. 

I did not feel that the rules had holes or were difficult to comprehend. I also didn't feel that the final showdown is anti-climactic. I went in for the ride, and thoroughly enjoyed it.

One of my favorites from Fantasy Flight, and one that needs expansions and a new edition.

RATING: 8
Fun game with lots of depth and detail. The board, bits, and cards are excellent quality. The mechanics are clever, using sets of cards for the Heros and varied actions for Sauron (a better system than the similar one used in Fury of Dracula), and a mechanic to limit game length. There were concerns over weak Heros and too much down time in a 4 player game. The winning conditions can also be either too hard or too easy, and Sauron tough to beat. Play length is way longer than 3hrs. But overall,  a great fantasy game. Top of my 'must play' list right now, not bad for someone who normally dislikes fantasy games!

RATING: 5
The figures are really sweet, but that is about it. I thought the game play was pretty damn tepid and most of us at the table were pretty bored. For a game that is supposed to be theme heavy it is rather abstract. War of the Ring is much, much more enjoyable and fits the Middle Earth theme much better. I would much rather play a game of Runebound than this any day. I actually did enjoy the combat system and the cards in relation to movement, but I am thinking it needs to blended with a better game.

1 play with James and Quentin.  The production of this game is typical FFG quality.  Nothing to complain about.  The figures included are just great.

Although, this is just one play, the game is marred by downtime by the heroes.  The Sauron player is actively involved in every turn, while the heroes who are not the phasing player, just sit and wait.  You can discuss with each other plans, but nothing else.

Also, a bit surprising, though this is a quest game, you cannot work together.  Fighting is separate and working together provides no benefit.

Lastly, like a Middle Earth games, this game seems a bit biased toward the Sauron player.  The heroes have to go all over the map to accomplish things to stop Sauron, but travel is very slow, and the game timer advances far quicker than the heroes can move.

I will give it another play though, but at first impression, there are other quest games that are much better.

First play under the belt. Kinda unsure what to say. Mechanics seem pretty smooth, once you "got"'em, Theme is embedded very well into the gameplay. Sauron (me) had the upperhand, by far. Don't know if it stays this way once the heroes (two noob-gamers and one tired geek) get a better hang of the rules and their options. So far, Sauron seems to be on the winner side, with many options to screw the heroes. But, "killing" them isn't the smartest - they respawn to fast with almost no important penalty...

RATING: 6
Hard one to rate. I was mostly having fun, but the end totally sucked. We played 2 players vs Sauron. We had our secret goal, and [i]almost[/i] completed it by the time our story marker got the end. But Sauron didn't complete his goal either. Rather than going one more turn, when we almost certainly could have completed our goal, we had a single final battle between only one player and a ring wraith. We won, but barely, but I really didn't care at that point, as I was much more interested in completing our goal. The game did a pretty good job of ewvoking the Tolkein theme, despite not being able to play any of the characters from the books, but in my one game, it appeared that most of the interesting decisions were limited to Sauron. The players basically are just trying to move to whatever the nearest useful place is, and fight any baddies along the way. Fights use simultaneous card play for attack selection. I'm not the hugest fan in the world of this, but at least there are some cards that make reference to previous, current, and future cards. This adds a little strategy to it. Oh, I'm not generally a co-op fan, and I like this more than any co-op I've ever played, with the exception of Knizia's LoTR, ironically. But I really liked how each players cards really only affected their movement and combat ability, so there's not really a need or even strongmotivation to discuss what each player has. This virtually completely eliminates the "one player to rule them all" scenario in most co-ops, which I so ardently detest.

Waiting to see how this one pans out with multiple plays. It does not immediately offend the Tolkien purist in me, despite having "female warrior" types. Rules are tough to pick up initially, but seem like they could streamline with more plays.

Long. First (2-player) game took 4+ hours, second took ~3.5 hours. Third only took 2.5 hours...might fit into a reasonable time frame once the rules are down pat!

A "learning game" for both sides, and an unforgiving and time-consuming one at that. First plays are just for getting accustomed to the general flow of the game and the various decks of cards.

0909: After one and two half-plays (never as a hero), I can say this is an engrossing game as Sauron, though it seems less involving for the heroes. The Dark Lord has set the agenda, and the heroes have had to dance to his tune. I'll be interested to see if I feel the same way once I've been on the other side of the conflict.

Fantasy Flight Games does it again.... another masterpiece of theme-gameplay integration.  When this puppy is set up and in action, you really get the feeling of traveling around Tolkien's world, trying to fight back the black tide of Sauron.  Whether you're controlling the heroes or the emissaries of Sauron, the battle is hard fought and always seems to come right down to the wire.  Tons of fun in this mid-sized box.

Preliminar rating with tutorial play. It seems more flexible than Arkham or Eldritch for heroes, and strategic for Sauron. After some turns it moves fast enough (two players with two heroes). I don know for now if many plays will go for a more strategic game or a boring experience with already known cards. I hope for first option.

Update: More playing and it seems a little boring and cumbersome for Sauron. I see that with many plays it can mitigate memory exercise, but ratio between strategy and fiddliness is a little poor in my view. Many disperse details for remembering.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I would describe this as a combination of Arkham Horror and Mageknight. As for Arkham Horror, it features a very long setup time with lots of random encounters, and heroes and monsters moving around a map with various plots needing Favor/Clues.

From Mageknight the game borrows a deck based system for hero actions and combat. Combat is interesting and complex, with secret simultaneous combat rounds. The downside of this longer combat is the fact that it's... longer. It can get boring waiting for other players to resolve long combats. 

The unique draw for the game is a player playing as Sauron. That player has lots of interesting plots, minions, cards, influence and a Shadow Power track. It's a bit overwhelming, really. Add in secret ovjectives for both side and you've got a really long and complex game.

The real downsie of the game is the length. When playing as a hero, it can easily take 20 or 30 minutes for your turn to come again. This wait can certainly kill the fun with some players. Another complaint is that the heroes don't have much to do. Unlike in Arkham or Eldritch Horror, you can't shop or buy items when you want them. Characters don't appear on the board very much in the beginning, and plots don't appear very quickly. It certainly doesn't feel like you are heroes saving the land. I believe playing as Sauron is more interesting (though I haven't done it myself).

Also playing as the hero 'Eleanor' sucks. She can't fight, and haviing 3 wisdom is almost never better than 2 wisdom. Collecting Influence is a bit boring, but her only duty. She can't really kill random monsters meaning her turn ends all the time, and she only has one crucial retreat card.

Tl;dr: Interesting game, but the turns really drag on, and playing as a hero can kind of drag.

If you're a fan of The Lord of the Rings (how can you not be?) and you enjoy meaty Ameritrash games, then I don't see how you could NOT enjoy this one.  I enjoy both, so of course I love this game.  It's great that I can get my LotR fix with more than 2 players; I have no desire to play WotR with anything other than 2.  

As with most recent FFG games of this style, the designers have incorporated several Euro mechanics in order to decrease the downtime, the length of the game, and the randomness--all of which I appreciate.  It will still take a couple of plays to become familiar with all the cards, but after that, it should play in a couple of hours.

The novel mechanics of how Hero movement and combat are related are very impressive.  The combat system is heads-and-tails better than that of Arkham Horror, with a similar story feel to it.

In what other game can a hero sneak into Barad Dur to rescue the tortured Gollum, and then get ambushed by the Mouth of Sauron?

Good solid questin' fun.  Organizing the components and going through the rules took 2+ hours, but now that I've got the hang of things I expect it would take about 10 minutes to teach to any experienced gamer.  2 or 3 players who know what they're doing should be able to finish in under 3 hours (in a 2-player game, the Hero player gets a double turn, so it's essentially the same as a 3-player game), but it seems to me that a 4-player game, with an added Hero player turn and extra Sauron actions, could run way too long and suffer from downtime issues.

Yet another overworked adventure game I was about to say, but this actually works despite the nagging feeling that it would benefit from some streamlining. In this game I actually like how everything is decided by cards and not by dice (despite the fact that I love dice).

Thematic fun game.  However there isnt a lot of variability for each race in terms of quests.  And some of the goal cards are too difficult.  But this game is fairly approachable and fun.  You have to look past the random card draws/events and enjoy the ride through Tolkien's Middle Earth.

RATING: 6
Fantasy Flight's best in-house game design yet. It is a descendant of the Fury of Dracula lineage, and I think it is far more fun and thematic than Arkham Horror. 

One to three players manage an archetypal Tolkien adventurer, and goes on quests to foil Sauron and his minions. The Sauron player tries to set up and defend income bases in three categories (finding the One Ring, raising an army, and corrupting leaders of the Free Peoples). Add some secret missions and you've got a fun little game! 

I very much like the game, there are plenty of sub-systems to figure out and each hero plays differently. You are pressed for time, need to rest, and are tempted to push into fights when not always ready! The Sauron player has tons of options and varied cards to juggle, and is likely faced with more choices than the heroes ever get.

I'm very glad this is not a game about buffing up, grinding up stats, and hucking piles of dice in meaningless monster fights. No talisman-like Monty Hall stuff, it's about plot plot plot. About time. And they set it up just like the classic ICE collectible card game, in an era between the Hobbit and LotR, so it can diverge from the 'game on rails' problems.

Two notable quibbles: I'm entirely not impressed with a double-blind-simultaneous combat, which is lame. Too bad they didn't take a cue from, say, Seventh Sea or any other fast-paced combat for the fighting. Also (yet again) FFG clearly failed to send this out to outside playtesters. Plenty of questions pop up that are not incorporated into the rules. They should have got past this basic step years ago!

RATING: 9
Well, none of us loved this game, but I think I liked it the most in my group. I think the game suffers somewhat from being rather procedural with substantial interruptions for mini-games, similar to Battlestar Galactica (another Corey Konieczka design). I think the combat in MEQ is substantially more interesting than the crisis resolution in BSG from a mechanistic viewpoint. However, it all adds up to feel like a bit of a slog.

I think I would be happy to play this game again, but I don't think I need to own it. As usually happens to me these days, it is the presence of another game in my collection that makes the decision easier. In this case, the other game is Fury of Dracula. That game has a similar feel in that one player is stringing trouble around a map to slow down a team of heroes. However, I think that FoD may be a cleaner design and adds the very enjoyable tension of the hide-and-seek, rather than depending on the plodding of the story markers down the track. 

UPDATE: This game continues to be on my mind since my last play, and maybe I am not as done with it as I thought.  I want to try it again!  I think 2 player might be the best way to play it, as it lets both sides do their turns faster.  That might help with the plodding and processional feel.

UPDATE UPDATE: Played it again 2 player, and I think I like it best that way - the snappy turns help alleviate the slogginess.  This is a decent design, but it still leaves me vaguely unsatisfied.  It is easy to make a single mistake or receive a defeat before the halfway point that pretty much decides the game.  The last turn is often pointless.  I think I could really like this game concept if it could somehow be tightened up and fit into 60-90 minutes.  I can see how some might really like this game, but it is not a long-term keeper for me.

UPDATE 3: Dammit, I'm thinking about playing this game again already.  Although I believe everything I said above, there is also something compelling about this game,  I guess this one is a keeper for now after all.

UPDATE 4: Okay already, I do like it.  Man, I've gone through a big arc on this one in a short time.  Most of my concerns have gone away now that I have a better idea of what this game is and how you need to approach it.  It is actually quite brilliant and very fun.  I am glad I stuck with it!  Now, my biggest problem with it is that I would love to see an expansion.

This strikes me as a good thematic experience game. A good game if you want sink your teeth into the world for a few hours. It takes a bit too long to finish to hit our table frequently.

The game will rank higher for fans of the LotR.  Non-fans, will rate it much lower.  The game is good ... and I would have given this game an 8 ... but battling the Ringwraiths if both sides fulfill their mission left this 4 hour game feeling rather anti-climactic.  I think a better end-game condition could have been developed instead of it being left to random card draws.

Not quite sure how I feel about this game. We didn't play with the right rules the first few turns. We slaughtered the rules.

Have mix feelings about the game. Not sure I would want to give this game a second try to see if my opinion changes. Game is quite long, longer than I expected. Or maybe it was us who were a bit slow. It was our first game after all. Not sure I would want to play this particulier game for a couple of hours. If the game would a bit different, maybe I wouldn't mind so much.

The theme of the Lord of the Rings is great, gameplay is less compared to War of the Ring. It's missing something. Maybe since we slaughtered the rules, it didn't help.

Played with 4 players. I think that 4 players is too much. Too much down time. 3 players would be more ideal.

Beautiful game! Just the artwork and components make up for half of the experience!! You actually feel like you're in Middle Earth (try playing with the LOR soundtrack for an even better time!). It is a long game, which I don't mind at all, but it does make losing a bit harder to digest ;)

RATING: 6
Based on one play, plus observation of a second (we had two games going on at once, a three and a four player game).

Hero and Sauron actions seem unbalanced, and for a dice-less game, there is a huge amount of randomness from multiple decks of cards. For example, the Sauron Mission card has no influence on what Plot Cards the Sauron player draws, so in our game he drew "Red" Plot Cards, but held a "Black" Mission. Our heroes met 4 of the 5 Hero Mission requirements, but failed to meet the mission that they drew, so we went into a Final Battle.

Combat feels clunky. "I play Overwhelming!" "Nope, your card is canceled."   "I play a melee card." "Nope, I have a card that says you die immediately." Our heroes squeaked out a victory, but it was just due to luck of the draw on combat cards, which does NOT seem Epic. (In fact, the theme was not immersive at all...)

Four player games take too darn long. (The three player game took 3.5 hours.)

With a bit of strategy to follow, is somewhat lacking in cards, especially Sauron missions and searching for heroes. Play with four players is quite long and somewhat boring. I like to play Sauron against a hero with two turns, and thus is a lot more fun.

I have to give credit to the designers for making an interesting game where one team of heroes (of 1 to 3 players) are going up against one other player controlling Sauron.  Normally in 1 vs. team games (ie Fury of Dracula and Descent), if the team only has one player that person is delegated to control multiple characters.  Not so in Middle-Earth Quest.  The game also plays very differently depending on whether you play a hero or Sauron.  There are some parallels that can be drawn between Arkham Horror and this game.  Heroes (Investigators) will explore Middle-Earth (Arkham) having Encounters (Encounters) and gathering gather Favors (Clues) to stop Sauron Plots (Close Gates).  Overall, the game is interesting and shows some innovation in design such as the decks of cards for the heroes serving as hit points, a means of travel, and method of combat.  I also like how combat is resolved with the card driven effects and limits on how many cards can be played per combat.  With all of that being said, it's not an overly exciting game and is probably a little too long for the enjoyment I get out of it.  The tie-breaker combat at the end should have been so much more epic, or something else should have been thought up.  No expansions were released for this over the past 7 years, so you're probably better off getting Arkham or Eldritch Horror unless you really love the LotR theme or want a 1-vs-all experience.

Great game that keeps you on your toes no matter what side you are playing.  The secret objectives make you second guess your choices and really have fun trying to figure out how to succeed in your game.  My one complaint is that if you do play a two-player game, make sure the player who is on the heroic side either plays two different characters, doesn't choose the fulfill both objective cards secret if playing only one character, and isn't just out to finish as quickly as possible.  As long as you avoid those three things, you should have fun.  As you can probably tell, someone made my first playthrough a bit rough...

This game has it all.  The atmosphere of LOTR has been captured.  It would be nice to have some more variety in character starting/advanced quests, but other than that, it's pretty close to flawless.

The rules are tough to muddle through the first time, but once you get them down, they are actually very easy.

I like this game a lot.  Fun adventure and a good sense of narative, with an interesting game system to explore.  I am finding that many of FFG's games have more complexity than is necessary, and this game suffers from that.  The problem is that thinking about the game's rules is not thinking about the game itself, which gets in the way of immersion in the actual game.  This game isn't too bad for that, and the overall game is excellent, so it's not a big deal. A great gift from Secret Santa 2009.

The thing I hate about this game is the Shadow Player. It is incredibly frustrating and boring to play the shadow player, if I had to play the Shadow Player I would rate the game at a 5. The heroes are really fun though, if I could play one of them I would give the game a rating of 8. Thus, the rating of 6.5

However, my brother and I have developed our own version of the game with an AI playing the Shadow player, and allowing up to five heroes. I would rate this game at a 8 or so.

Really enjoyed this on the first play through and wanted to play again straight after.

The finale is a little lame and so we didn't play that part and the quests for the good guys seem to vary hugely in complexity i.e. have 5 favour which you wouldn't really need to pursue it would just happen or only 2 monsters on the board, which you would have to actively pursue.

Looking forward to a second game of this in the next few days :)

RATING: 5
Interesting but long game, very fiddly. There are balance issues, limited ability to influence the victory conditions if luck is against you, and the tiebreaker finale is a washout.

Duration: I spent a lot of time waiting for Sauron and looking for specific locations on the board.
Design: I like the two-games-in-one, the effort to differentiate regions and encounters, and how Sauron has to play plots, but there were too many mechanics with too few mattering. I enjoyed the combat system and the hero card system, but the missions aren't balanced and the finale is a fizzle.
Strategy: The heroes play reactively to stall Sauron, who may not even draw the plots necessary to win. There's moving about and fighting, but it's only a bit of it matters.
Components: Very pretty game, beautiful board but very hard to find locations. Heaps of chits and counters and different stacks of cards, with great production values.
Theme: I like Tolkien and the way Sauron has to build up influence and Shadow Pool in order to do things. The finale is a washout though - it doesn't make sense, isn't fun, and is strategically crippled (all-out-attack against all-out-defence).

MEQ is a semi-cooperative game where it's everyone against Sauron who breeds his dark plots that threaten to corrupt the world and which the heroes need to interfere with.

While the game is first and foremost an experience game it doesn't solely rely on its theme. There are important and meaningful decisions to be made on both sides, but most especially for the Sauron player. The card-based combat is quite charming, with each character having a personal deck of combat options.

That said, card draws still play a major role, starting with Sauron's plots and random encounters, and (maybe most impacting) ending with the goal cards. Each side is assigned a secret goal. When one side meets its criteria at the end of the game and the other doesn't, that's an auto-win. Otherwise there is a final battle between one hero and the ring wraiths. Some of those goal cards appear to be much easier than others.

MEQ is a long game, and in my eyes a little longer than it should be. In addition, the end game feels unfinished and anti-climactic, the game actually loses tension during the last few turns. The players mostly know whether they reached their goals, and the heroes will often stay put in order to not endanger their position. The game is then decided by the missions or in a final battle, and both feel sufficiently un-epic as to be a turn-off.

I recall enjoying this game quite a bit the first time, but this time it was a bit different. Being evil was fun, but the rest of the players felt that the objectives were not crucial enough to keep the game's energy going for the 3 hours that it always must take. Ultimately, it is the objective that causes panic and if the one that you have chosen has nothing to do with some of the other mechanics in the game, those particular mechanics come off lackluster. MEQ totally wins for theme, components, and depth, but loses on tension and purpose. Waiting for your turn is never that fun; this can be a problem of most long games, but regardless this has to be addressed. If evil is winning, I'm sure the tension would come from collecting favour tokens, but with a clear cut advantage for good, favour tokens almost become useless. I'm sure MEQ feels tense in some games and not so in others, but it all relies on the cards you pull at the beginning of the game and some of the random elements throughout. In that case, this might just not be a game I pull out again, especially considering the length of time it takes to learn, play and how long it takes, especially if the "fun" factor could be hampered by random elements.

Wonderful RPG board game set in the Middle Earth. Just gawking at the amazing board is an experience, playing it is an experience unlike any other (how many games make you feel like heroes of the Middle Earth or Sauron?).

Two plays so far in a 3 player environment - heroes won both times.  There are some neat parts to the game - Sauron's influence mechanic, the deck based combat/life/fatigue, hidden missions, great rules index, minion progression - and other that are less than neat - plot deck mechanic seems boom or bust for Sauron, bland and repetitive quests, some overly crunchy rules, minimal hero progression.

Would play again if we can think of ways to speed it up.

I wish there was more variety in the quests but I guess that's a small gripe. A very fun game well suited to three players; a situation I am oft confronted with. I have found this game to be very challenging as the heroes which adds considerably to it's appeal. An FFG game featuring the group vs one bad guy. I *much* prefer Middle Earth Quest to Mansions of Madness.

RATING: 9
[b][i]Middle-Earth Quest[/b][/i] throws a group of heroes (is a group of heroes an adventuring?) into Tolkien's Arda while one evil player is Sauron seeking to corrupt Middle-Earth. This game describes a long and harrowing adventure. The tension of this adventure combined with the locations and quests make MEQ one of the most thematic games I've played. Some have complained that the heroes were fabricated for the game and thus you don't play Aragorn or Legolas. I would have complained if you did play better known heroes because the events described in the game, while possible to have been done outside of Tolkien's histories by other characters, were not done by Gimli and Frodo. In this way even the choice of characters adds to the theme.

The designers of this game had a stroke of genius in creating the heroes' card decks. Each hero has a unique deck that is used for traveling, combat, remaining energy (when in hand), and life (when in deck). The uniqueness of each deck adds direction to the individual heroes. Is your hero better equipped to travel through forests? Then perhaps you should head to Mirkwood. Cards in hand represent energy and can be used to travel or fight (with each hero having unique combat abilities). After a card is used, it goes to the rest pool; resting allows you to recover all spent cards. But when you take damage, cards go to the damage pool and require healing to be recovered. In this way the hero decks--a single game element--naturally encompasses available actions, combat abilities, remaining life, and adds the strategic push-your-luck choice of when to rest or heal; and all this is done in a manner that gives each hero markedly different strengths and abilities. Oh, one more thing: The hero decks also include a level-up mechanism in that training allows you to add better cards to your deck. Sauron, meanwhile, plays completely differently. The way the Enemy interacts with the heroes is always exciting.

There are some great game elements in Middle-Earth Quest, and they're drenched in the Lord of the Rings theme. Consequently, I imagine one's enjoyment of the game will decline if you are indifferent or even against the theme (if such is possible). As for me, a Tolkien fan, I think MEQ is a fantastic game.

Comments are for 2P;

Very thematic with clever mechanics. IMHO this is not designed to be a 2P game as the Hero player really needs to control multiple heroes (the single-hero variant is uninteresting and a little biased against Sauron).

Sauron's turn is interesting but short-lived, then the Hero player would effectively have 2 turns. Boring for Sauron.

Also seems a bit clunky, but it is certainly fun.

I am 5 and 1 as Sauron ... I have not yet had a chance to play as one of the heroes so I can't fully judge the game yet.
Still, from the Sauron standpoint, this game is very challenging - some win conditions much harder than others, but I like all the options. You really have to be keep your eye on a lot of different things to do well as Sauron in a 3 player game. I think Sauron is a bit easier to play in a 4 player game as he gets more actions on his turn which help him focus more on his strategies.

Incredible theme. Love how the story unfolds as the game progresses. Pretty easy to play once you get into the rhythym, but there is a lot to digest the first time around.  Long set up and long play time, although some have reported clocking in under 2 hours. We'll have to see if that actually is possible as we play more often. If you like LOTR books, movies, other games, Middle Earth Quest is a must-have!

Finally I got to play this classical ameritrash FantasyFlight. 

What can I say? It is thematic at moments, epic at others, you struggle while you suspect that it will all be for naught. This is a 2 player game at heart, it is pretty long lasting at least 3-4+ hours. Yet I had fun, and I'd play again given the chance, but I won't rush to do so.

Need more plays to consolidate my opinion of the game one way or another, as for now I'm on the fence.

UPDATE
Played once again. This time as the Heroes. Hard game to get through, but interesting and very well themed. One point of interest is the combat system which is straightforward, exciting and fast. That said, this is a long-drawn game which I need to be in the mood for before I'll play this again. The rating stands.

Brilliant, immersive game with a unique atmosphere: instead of re-telling LotR, you're making your own adventure as either a Free Peoples hero or as Sauron. Game takes longer than the box says it does (no surprise) but it's a tense and exciting couple of hours. Rules took a bit over an hour to get through, the rest was all gamplay. The card-based combat is genius, it made every combat session a nail-biter, and provided fun and laughs all around for both winner and loser. This is a great game.

Don't touch games that are based on movies, books, comic books or video games. They're there to make a quick buck... this game is a bit better than usual, but still falls behind games that are not based on those elements.

If you thought Arkham Horror was heavy, play this game, it's as heavy but much less fun.

Also, I don't see the point in playing with more than 2 players. It's really a 2 player game. One players incarnates Sauron, the other the heroes. Like Axis & Allies or Fortress America, not worth playing with more than 2 players since it takes forever to play one turn.

Don't buy this unless you have already played.

RATING: 8.5
A story based, card driven game for 2 to 4 players that is completely asymmetric and that is set in a well established game world. Could the potential for blowing things be any higher? This game pulls it off amazingly! 

The game sets a gang of unsung heroes against Sauron and his dark designs. The game is dripping with atmospheric story cues for the Tolkien enthusiast (even without reading out the amazing flavour texts on the cards). The entire game is card driven: Sauron employs Plots, Shadow actions, Perils, Corruption cards; the heroes make use of Travel/Combat cards, Quests and Items; Event and Encounter cards blend perfectly into the basic mechanics. The asymetry between Sauron and the heroes borders on the extreme. Sauron's possibilities are rather passive but more pervasive: he spreads his influence as far as possible, hatches his plots and occasionally relocates a monster or minion to protect important places and narrow down the heroes' options with his corrupting influence. The heroes, on the other hand, are initially free to roam Middle-Earth, travel from here to there, meet characters, win favours, further their quests. And yet the two sides meet time and again in gripping interaction. And whether Sauron is opposed by one, two or three heroes, the game mechanics keep it all together. 

The one weak point of this game is that the showdown can be anti-climactic in the sense that a long and thematically rewarding game can be decided by a single combat between a hero and the Ring Wraiths, which is influenced by the play that lead up to it in a rather contrived manner.

I playtested and have demoed this game quite a bit.  There are other games that get picked first to play for me.  This may be a little biased because I only ever get to play Sauron.  It is fun and does a good job of portraying the feeling of Tolkein.  

My personal feeling is that it was rushed to be done in time for GenCon and could have done with some more work pre-publishing.

Not a bad game, but not great either.

Really fun, much better than I expected. Ok true some parts of mechanic are total rip-off from Arkham Horror but still there is something that players love when it comes to playing one guy against everyone else.

One guy takes the role of Sauron and all others take the roles of characters in the world of J.R.R. Tolkien.

Only downside to this game (and any other game with same limitation) is the maximum number of players and that is 4. Usually we have more players in my group, plus when you take into account that my wife hates everything LOtR related it hits the table far les than I would want to.

If you have smaller gaming group it is really worth getting.

Not really good : a little bit booring, you never know if what you are doing will give you victory. Too much token.
 
Not really bad : Nice combat system and beautiful map and minis.

I think playing sauron is over complicated.

Reminds me Somewhat of Eldritch Horror in the way that you need to shut down plots to stop Sauron from spawning monsters. 
The twist here is you control Sauron and the way the heroes and Sauron have two completely dif playstyles work really good together.

Yera, tambien D.A

Muy buen juego tematico de aventuras cooperativo basado en  el mundo de "el señor de los anillos" (cronologicamente se juega en un periodo intermedio entre los sucesos de "el hobbit" y los de "el señor de los anillos"). 

Ambientacion excelente. El juego al principio abruma un poco con la cantidad de posibles acciones y la amplitud del mapa, pero el turno esta bien estructurado y con un buen resumen a mano y un poco de practica, se solventa. 

Tiene un defectillo (aparte de que es un juego en el que es muy facil olvidar cosas), y es que dependiendo de los objetivos particulares de cada bando, el juego se puede hacer muy sencillo o muy cuesta arriba, y la resolucion del "empate" (cuando acaba el juego y ninguno de los dos bandos cumple las condiciones de victoria) es algo pobre. 

Despues de varias partidas jugadas, MEQ se gana muy merecidamente un largo 8.

Excellent adventure game, bravo! The combined movement/health/combat/levelupping decks are the best way of handling rpg like system in a boardgame I've ever seen. A stroke of genius and it also makes each character individual in where they can move easier and which fighting style they use. The rest of the game doesn't quite reach the same level of ingenuity, but the combination makes it an excellent and just Epic enough exerience to make me always want to play this, when a full evening slot and suitable gaming company can be found. I have to add a disclaimer, though: I've only played Sauron so far, so I don't know how good it is from the other side...

RATING: 7
Rating after one play as Sauron.  THe combat mechanism is simple and clever.  The Sauron action system has a couple of cool mechanics and the diminishing returns system prevents you from concentrating on one path too much.  The Sauron actions are easy to grasp.  There is a lot to do as Sauron and rarely enough actions to do it all with.  It really feels like you are Sauron trying to screw with middle earth, which is really cool.

As the heroes, I got the idea they either felt like they were just reacting to Sauron or had nothing to do on their turn.  I don't think they felt very tolkien-theme-ish either.  It would be nice if it were a little more obvious where the buffs are at so if they have nothing to do they can at least build up skills, items, or something.  I don't think the game is as much fun for the heroes as it is for Sauron, and it definitely isn't as thematic.  There should have been a little more background and differentiation between the heroes too.

The endgame is really disappointing.  If neither side completes their mission, or if both sides complete their mission, the tiebreaker is a fight with a minion you've probably already fought and killed 2 or 3 times.  This is just unacceptable for a game this long, and it really is difficult to avoid if the players are at equal skill level (ie, both completing the mission or neither).  I am sure FFG will "fix" this with a $50 expansion to an $80 game, but it still rubs me the wrong way.

Overall I like the game but I don't think I like it enough to buy it.  Like Starcraft, Age of Conan, and Android, MEQ feels like it was a few playtesting sessions from being a really awesome hit, but it falls just short in my opinion, due to being a little  lacking in theme for the heroes (reminds of age of conan) and having an annoying endgame (reminds of starcraft).

Update: taught it and watched a second game.  Feel the same way.  Mechanically, it is very similar to arkham horror for the heroes, but for sauron the game plays more like a tile laying game with some combat tacked on.  Tigris-like, almost.  If an expansion comes out that makes the endgame super sexy and exciting instead of bland, overbalanced and anticlimactic I would definitely be interested in buying it.  As is, Arkham fills a similar role in my game collection, has a more unique and better executed theme, and I like it better.

RATING: 6.5
Nearly a great game. Lots of theme. But just too random for this type of game. Too hard to both meet win condition and advance story track so it actually counts. The the final battle depends on what cards you draw from randomly from the mix. Seems to make all the play leading up to the final battle nearly useless. I want to like this a lot more, but can't.

This might look like "Arkham Horror", but it's an entirely different beast. Kind of hard to grasp at first for both sides, but eventually it comes together quite nicely. The drawn out card combat is kind of cool, but severly hampers the game in terms of downtime. Never play it with more than three.

A correctly designed game with rather elegant rules.
The combat subsystem is a mixed blessing; on one hand, it's interesting and funny.  On the other hand, it eats time; most of the time, in the 3+ hours the game will last, you'll be fighting.

edit: I should not have tried this game with more than 3 players; the downtime is awful.  In fact the game is only good for 2 players (and thus not a coop at all).

Owned this game for less than a week before trading it away for an OOP title.

Later.

Love the movement/combat/life cards idea. This is one of the best design innovations I've seen in a long time.

[i]I can imagine this system being used as a simple collectible RPG. A character class would be a deck of cards which the player would customize. Going up levels would entail adding new skill cards to your deck. Skill cards would be sold separately.[/i]

Just wish the rest of MEQ was as awesome as the life pool concept...

Still an excellent game, though.

This is a thematic game from FFG, so its mechanics are pretty similar to most FFG games that I've played. Lots of decks of cards. Move across the board. Do some kind of "quest". Fight.

The theme on this one is some kind of pre-Lord of the Rings bogosity wich sorta-Lord of the Rings characters.

I liked the quasi-coop style of this one and the LOTR setting fits that pretty well but the entire experience was just sort of meh for me. Long and I'm not a drooling fanboy for Lord of the Rings. For fairly similar play, I think I prefer Runewars.

This is a very atmospheric game which requires at least 3 hours of time (plus 30-45 mins for set-up and removal). You should play it "for the experience" instead of winning, since it has the classical Fantasy Flight dilemma of strong theme paired with convoluted rules that can make it difficult for one side to win (see below).

I would only recommend it for 2 players, though. Otherwise the downtime is way too high for the "good" players.
However, the "good" side should play with at least 2 characters or will otherwise have no chance, since Sauron can concentrate all his powers on this lonely sad little hero...

Middle Earth Quest certainly has an epic feel to it, both in its scope and in the sheer number of cards and components that Fantasy Flight have squeezed into the box. It's sensibly set in pre-Lord of the Rings Middle Earth, so the good characters aren't constrained by a one point plot about having to destroy the Ring. The quests are fairly one-dimensional, most just involve visiting a location, but the combat system is great. There's just a hint of arbitraryness about the victory conditions, so not a buy for me, but an above-average FFG big box game.

[b]THERE ARE REASONS UNTOLD STORIES ARE UNTOLD; IF SUCCESFUL, THOSE INVOLVED IN THE STORY DON’T WANT OR DON’T NEED OTHERS TO KNOW THEIR DEEDS, FOR MOTIVES NOT WORTH MENTIONING; IF UNSUCCESFUL, THEY DON’T WANT OTHERS TO KNOW ABOUT THE MISADVENTURES OR MAYBE THEY’RE NOT AROUND ANYMORE TO TELL THEIR OWN STORIES [/b]

After The Lord of the Rings trilogy of movies hit the cinemas at the beginning of the century (Talking about it like it happened so long ago is fun…), gaming industries have jumped on the success wagon and poured out an amazing amount of material and Tolkien-inspired games and merchandise, from Monopoly editions to RTS computer games about the War of the Ring. However, every now and then unorthodox ideas emerge, where developers and companies venture into the fan-fiction realm of things and come out with games not directly inspired by the universes they’re trying to pay tribute to, but to ideas based on the universes themselves, about alternate stories, different points of view, the plot holes. Such is the case of Middle-earth Quest.

The interesting thing about this game is that, while coo-operative in nature, the game is not developed against a non-existent opponent, an imaginary force behind the machinations of the game, but to another flesh and bone player, who takes the role of Sauron reborn, looking for the Ring. The other players take on the role of heroes hailing from different backgrounds and cultures within Middle-earth, representing the Elves, the Dwarves, Rohan and other Free People, each with his own mission but united in the common purpose of thwarting the early plans of Sauron for expansion in Middle-earth.

The story is attractive and the aesthetics, though a bit “modern” for traditional Tolkien fans, is still amazing and novel. Every bit, every card in the game is beautifully illustrated and perfectly distinguishable from each other, featuring colorful, warm schemes for the cards used by the Heroes and colder darker tones for the cards used by Sauron and his minions. The same can be said for the miniatures, exquisitely sculpted, if only a bit fragile and “bendy”. All of this comes in abundant amounts, just like anyone would expect from the boys at Fantasy Flight Games.

The obvious complaint about this game is not only its size (Much like War of the Ring, the board game is so big it had to be separated into two halves), but how long it takes to play it, to properly learn how to play it and how to teach it to other players. If you’re going to play this game, players should be warned that this will most likely be the only game they’ll play for the entire evening, and maybe they won’t even finish it. Look for real Tolkien fans and board game freaks when playing this game, in order to like it, play it as fast as possible and win it in the shortest amount of time possible.

But, all in all, I don’t regret having this game. I don’t know why this is, but it is.

[b][i]II. Sliders[/i][/b]

Abstract [b]________[COLOR=#FF0000][9][/COLOR]_[/b] Themed: Fan-fiction’s not a very good place to borrow inspiration from, because it’s not as stable and complete as a full fledged canon-based inspired product. However, this game could be considered a good tribute to Tolkien and how important his works are to mankind. Creating this game sounds like a logical step in the Tolkien gaming industry. Also, the intricate turn phases and considerations maybe are too well built around the them itself, and trying to adapt it to other topics would not only prove useless, but dangerous and a risk of losing most of what this game actually offers.
 
Simple [b]_________[COLOR=#FF0000][10][/COLOR][/b] Complex: Its amazing board and turn sequence is amazingly complex, to the point of actually being somewhat of a drag to remember each step and all the options each player has when it’s his turn to move. I don’t think this game can be actually mastered, but it would sure prove to be fun to try..

Strategic [b]____ [COLOR=#FF0000][5][/COLOR]_____[/b] Tactical: Because the co-operative nature of this game is aimed to be used against other player, who’s not as smart as the game itself and is bound by the same core rules as the opponents, strategies might work better in this game than in other co-op games, but that means the Heroes must work as a real team and try to take advantage of everything around them, even if they are far from each other. Sometimes, the game will allow for some relaxation for everyone while they prepare for the next phase of the plan (If any...), so tactics may be created and put to the test while looking for particular items, actions or events. After all, it’s a RPG game. 
 
Luck [b]_______[COLOR=#FF0000][8][/COLOR]__[/b] Skill: The RPG element in this game is so obvious you can’t disregard it when approaching the game. Each character has a certain set of skills based on the cultural aspects of each of them. Trying to brave every circumstance on your own may not be a good idea, but if players use their cards well, sometimes surprises happen and tables are turned. Luck plays a minor part in this game, but mostly it is all about the players’ actions and decisions. 

Fiddly [b]__[COLOR=#FF0000][3][/COLOR]_______[/b] Elegant: The extensive rule book, the intricate turn phase system, the inhuman amount of factors to be taken into consideration and no quick reference card or sheet for the players make it impossible to play this game without the rule book close at hand. For a game this good, it is a shame the developers missed that important element.
 
Indirect interaction [b]_________[COLOR=#FF0000][10][/COLOR][/b] Direct interaction: As an RPG, it is all about team work and utilitarianism, if needed. The Sauron player in turn may decide to play along with the Heroes’ ideas and plans if he sees through them, and then save the best for last as a surprise. In the end, it’s how the players act with each other and how they face each other that they’ll rise to glory and win or be killed by some of Sauron’s minions and monsters. 

Cutthroat [b]___[COLOR=#FF0000][4][/COLOR]______[/b] Friendly: Sometimes, the game will end when certain events have happened, and maybe the player’s may not need to face each other and treat each other like direct threats to their plans, but that is usually not the case, since the game is meant to be played with aggressiveness and determination from both parts, Sauron and the Heroes. Plus, being the bad guy means you have to be as cruel and relentless as it gets, especially because of the insane amount of power the Sauron player has.

Heavy use of language [b][COLOR=#FF0000][1][/COLOR]_________[/b] No language needed: Whoa, lots and lots of cards and in-board text. Grab a dictionary and prepare to read till your eyes fall off.

[b][i]III. Number of players recommended[/i][/b]: 4.

[b]CHEERS![/b]

One of the best adventure/strategy games out there, that builds on similar games (most notably Arkham Horror), but being a competitive game gives it a unique feel. Plenty of options for both sides, combat is quick but interesting and the card/life/rest/damage system is brilliant.

I do wish there were more interesting quests and a better ending, but still a great game.

The best "adventure" game for me. Creates strong Middle Earth atmosphere, has interesting and thematic decisions to make. I like semi-cooperative games more and more, and think they are the best approach to the adventure genre - the individual race doesn't make much sense and doesn't work well, while full cooperation takes away the thrill of confrontation (cooperation helps build an adventure feeling, but confronting a live player rather than the "system" is more fun - with the right players of course).

I was playing once and I can say that this game is very well made. Each side has their own strategy to follow, but the co-operation among the "light" side players could be more effective.

La primera impresión es muy positiva. Es el mejor multijugador basado en el mundo de Tolkien que he probado. Para 2 jugadores me sigue gustando más La Guerra del Anillo, pero con más jugadores, esta es mi opción preferida. Los fantásticos componentes y el sistema de juego incrementan la inmersión de los jugadores. Como una pequeña pega, creo que Sauron tiene mucho más que hacer que el resto de jugadores y disfruta más el juego que el resto.Además la cooperación entre los jugadores es bastante limitada. Aún así muy recomendable.

I can take it or leave it.  Seemed longish for what it is, and its pretty fiddly.  Lots of trying to figure out where you are so you can do the right deck, moves for quests, etc etc.  The board is TERRIBLE, and the entire game loses at least a -1 from me simply from how busy the board is, and how incredibly hard it is to: 1) seen the towns, 2) see anythng other than green 3) find "areas".  All of the board issues could have been prevented with better thought to the board.  There is a TON of wasted space on the board that could have been off on a side board and helped quite a bit (Sauron stuff, I'm looking straight at you).  Too much consideration was given in the beautification of the board over the playability.

The Sauron player has lots of strong cards he can (and should) horde for the late game.  I have my doubts Sauron can be beaten with any regularity after one play.  

There are no rewards for killing the stronger Sauron minions, which exhaust significant resources to do, at zero expense for the Sauron player...this seemed like a serious omission to me, as you will undoubtedly be forced to fight at least one (probably 3+) of these.

Our game semmed really close until the last two turns, then we found out how far from close it really was...we got smoked by tons of Sauron cards and minions decimating our ability to do anything.

The "Sauron player discards X" really should all have "AT RANDOM" at the end of them, rather than allowing him to just ditch the crap out of his hand since it appears there are really crap Sauron cards and really strong ones.

More than a couple of the bad cards that are permanent against the good guys are WAY stronger than others in the deck.

This game is difficult to analyze, I think that idea is not bad, there are things interesting and, in some way, you may feel as if you were in Middle-Earth, but, after playing 3 or 4 times and not having enjoyed any single one, I have to say that the game is boring. They didn't achieve the goal, is the only that I can say. It is true that I only played the game as a "good" guy and never as Sauron, but, in any case I can not recommend this game

RATING: 7
As soon as I heard about this I had it labeled as a TWO player game.  Judging from lots of the low ratings I was right. Just like Fury of Dracula, downtime is going to be a problem when it is not your turn as a player in a 4 player game and your turns are going to be even less interesting.  

Same thing will apply here. It does sounds like the heros still dont have so many interesting options compared to the baddies but at least I know it will play well as a 2 player game. Downtime becomes a non-issue just like FOD. Lots of games fall into this category by trying to be something they are not. Dont be fooled, I would not play with more 2, why do it if you know its a problem?  3 at most for either game, MOST.  

Overall right now it looks like typical FF, so close to an epic classic but not properly perfected. Maybe you guys need more "outsider" playtesters who are unbiased. Obviously you need to cut down the fiddliness and gametimes a notch too. (This, Android, etc, etc) 

Rating impression maybe an 8 for 2 players (and some of that is my soft spot for theme otherwise would be lower I'm sure like 7.  Same goes for WOTR though)

[u]UPDATE:[/u] Okay so I finally got to play this and it was pretty cool overall but I was also underwhelmed.  Combat was nifty in a Fury of Dracula kind of way but as the good guys I felt turns weren’t all that interesting, bad guys might have a couple more options not sure yet.  I was kind of tired while learning and this probably affected my enjoyment too though.  I think the whole theme doesn’t quite come together as well either as it does in WOTR which I like a lot better than this, and this is my ALL-TIME favourite theme too so maybe a bit of disappointment stems from that.  

2 player only game for me too as I suspected, 3 tops.  Just a race game really?  An assymetrical LOTR adventure game, shit, this should have been an instant favourite for me yet it seems I don’t really have much if any desire to play this again and it seems to be too long as is too. Something seems to be missing not sure what yet, maybe strategy but I see some people saying its there in spades.  Guess I need to try again and maybe I am missing the devil in the details....

It's one of those rare games that give me the feeling that, if I had the resources to create, playtest and publish a boardgame, the final result would be pretty much what they came up with. I am extremely impressed by most aspects of the game, so I'll just list what I don't find so good, since all the rest is pretty much great:

-The game is extremely brutal on Sauron. Playing the bad guy is hard, very hard, especially for the first few games.

-2 secret Missions of the heroes are kinda broken and Sauron can easily stall them if he wishes so, which may not be a bug as such (playing that way definitely won't give victory to Sauron), but it's very lame. That is the no 1 thing I am gonna houserule somewhat.

-There could be a bit more diversity: more heroes, items, events, quests and such.

-Character progression and customization is pretty minimal for an adventure game (more a design choice than anything though).

-Playing Sauron can be boring. He just get 2 small actions each turn and some players may not enjoy what they get to play.

But all those criticisms are in fact quite minor. It's a great game that fans of adventure games and LOTR should buy without much hesitation.

***UPDATE***
After lots of play, the game is still as fun, but is starting to show its hollow interior under its glimmery surface. It's just not a very deep game. Lowering my rating from 9 to 8.

Brilliant narative game - with asymetrical game play and multiple routes to victory.

Cards and board are great.  Plastic figures were partly broken on arrival - but great customer service from FFG soon sorted that out.

Possible downtime issues with four or more players, hard to identify places on the board and rules can seem fiddly.

I’m kind of disappointed with the game. As I love the LOTR background, I thought this game would be a blast to play. So far I have had two regular sessions. The game is long, that doesn’t bother me, however the downtime can be excessive with 4 players and that definitively bothers me a lot. I won’t play this again with 4 ever. I think its sweet spot is 3 FAST players or even 2 (with a player controlling 2 heroes). Still there is a problem with the slow flow of the game.

There are a lot of easy rules, taking them all at the beginning can be a bit intimidating, but after a turn you know them all.

The game components are GREAT, the map is awesome detailed and very big. The art is ok, the miniatures are very cool and the games comes with lots of cards, making each game different. The gameplay, however, is not as fun as I hoped, I didn’t feel any tension. The combat is a little weird but very easy to learn.

I think playing Sauron is a lot more fun that playing the heroes. Sauron has 3 (or 2 actions) each turn creating tense and interesting decisions and, in general, has a lot more to plan and think about than the heroes. In theory I also liked that the heroes use their live to move and attack, however when I played the heroes this wasn’t as fun.

I heavily dislike when a four hour game is decided on a final combat, this is lame and Sauron is at a severe disadvantage as his “champion” uses the ravager deck, not a lot of defense in there. I wish there was another tiebreaker available.

In conclusion, it seemed like a good game. It has lots of great ideas, however the game is not fun enough. I’m willing to play it more to review my feelings toward the game, besides I paid someone to paint the gorgeous miniatures and I really want to like this game.

RATING: 6
Fun adventure game.  I really like Sauron's action choice mechanic (select an action once for full benefit, but each same selection after that is at a reduced benefit).  The adventurers were interesting and seemed relatively balanced (but it was only one play).  The goal cards did NOT seem balanced (again, just one play).  In any case, I'm willing to try again but not begging for a rematch.

RATING: 6
Middle Earth Quest seems to follow a recent (?) trend in design that smuggles generic resource management into a supposedly (?) narrative experience. There are lots of cards and lots of symbols on the cards, and a lot of time is spent playing the "how many" game. 

Is this FFG's new winning strategy? To take a theme heavy experience and put several interdependent capacities into the core gameplay? I found it lacking. Not bad, but fairly uninspired. I'd play again but I don't think I'll be more impressed.

RATING: 7
Nice production, excellent combat system. Really enjoyed it!

**Update** rated down to a 7. This game has a neat combat system and nice interlocking game systems, its just a bit low on excitment and unpredictability. Strategy is also subject to co op group think, which can mean that individual turns are unexciting.

Will still happily play with friends, but ready to move on to something else already : (

I Should play as Sauron, that may be more fun.

The combat is similar to DQ. Odd strategy in this, but works. To play Sauron you really need multiple plays with it to really have a clue as to what you are doing.

Adoro este juego. Me parece simplemente impresionante, tanto estéticamente como en jugabilidad. No tiene el 10 por el desempate final y el no tener una expansión que proporcione más cartas y personajes.

RATING: 7
If this adventure game didn't take 3 hours with experienced players it would get a higher rating. There are so many flavour cards that no single game will play out the same. The best single feature is the great card-based combat resolution system which will hopefully be seen in other games as well. 
Compared to other FFG big box games I know, MEQ has the advantage that it's more accessible than War of the Rings or Warcraft/Runebound (which I haven't played) and more time-definite, elegant and less fiddly than Arkham Horror. I'm no FFG fan but together with Fury of Dracula this is their best offering for me so far. They both fill the same niche of longer but not too long "experience games".
There are a few issues which might prove critical with more plays. The secret goals vary in difficulty. Some might be a breeze depending on the board constellation and card draws while others might be nearly impossible to achieve. In the later half of the game it can derail when the heroes don't care any more for the plots. Most of what's happening on the board doesn't matter then any more. After one play this doesn't bother me too much as I had good fun but limits it together with the playing time to a 7/10.

No está mal, pero el uno-contra-todos lo elimina de mis preferidos. Si el jugador Sauron se sustituyera por mecánicas, sería mejor juego. Tampoco me pareció que fuera muy cooperativo.

RATING: 8
One of the few LOTR games where the good guys have a decent chance of winning. Sauron has some really tough choices in this game, and can't just walk away with a win. The heroes move fast, strike hard, and can't be truly killed. The game is complicated and could have definitely benefited from some crib sheets, but it is a lot less intimidating than it first appears. The rulebook is excellent, with tons of examples to help you out. My only complaints are ones that apply to the adventure game genre as a whole: the downtime between turns is a bit much and the game itself is too long. Because of this, it won't get played much in my house.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A prelude to the days of Lord of the Rings. Players run across a board, trying to stem Sauron's influence while attempting to complete their own secret mission.

Overall, the feel was not great. It was a mix of mechanics from other FFG games: most notably Arkham Horror and WoW:tBG with the combat system of Fury of Dracula thrown in. A little too long and draggy, downtime especially bad for combat (made me laugh when I saw 'very fast combat' in the rulebook). Too many minor/fiddly rules that are easy to miss.

Also, players don't really work together. This isn't a cooperative game. Player do their own thing without interacting with other players which I thought was a major disappointment.

I really enjoy this game and would say I enjoy it as much as War of the Ring.  The board is massive but necessarily so.  I really enjoy the mechanics for the heroes but particularly like playing Sauron.  It's very thematic to watch Sauron's influence slowly grow and spread over Middle Earth followed by a very nice variety of minions and monsters.  I really enjoy the battle mechanic as well; it is very unique with heavy strategy and little luck.  And one of the greatest strengths of this game is the variety of cards.  Every single region has it's own specific cards so that events occur exactly as they should (the Balrog only shows up in Moria for ex.). I would have preferred to see much more diversity in the heroes quests.  Only 4 possible quests per hero?  Not good enough.  The components were also cheap with two or three of the figures broken on arrival.  Fortunately FFG is a great company and replaced the entire set of figures.  All in all this is a great game regardless of which side you play on.

RATING: 5
So...the 5 rating might be more an indictment on the overall "time to value" ratio.  It takes waaay too long for what you get out of it, imo.

The gameplay is solid, if not riddled with minutia. 

The fun factor is medium, imo.

The tension is decent, actually, and holds throughout the race.  Yes, it's more of a race...putting out fires and meeting small term objectives.  Fluid strategy is needed as your plans might change from turn to turn.

There are some good things there, as just mentioned above.

I just wish it would play in 2 hours.  Then it'd be more "right" for me...

RATING: 6
I find the combat system a little bit annoying, though it's cool that the ranged/melee ratios are elegantly integrated into the iconography. But it can be frustrating to pull out the cards and end up in a situation where if your opponent happens to play Ranged, you win by a million, but if they play Melee, you die die die. As for the meat of the game, I'm not sure where it is. You end up playing around the world of Middle Earth the same way kids play soccer around the cars in a parking lot. 

Still, a good game. I played as one of the heroes in a 3 player my first time, and it seemed impossibly difficult - we were halfway up the track when Sauron won. I expect that'll change, but it makes my bowels twinge when I discover that your character has to be correctly aligned to your mission and Sauron's quest choices if you want to pull out a victory. (Newsflash: Eleanor is NOT ideal for taking down the snake guy who starts in the far south.) 

MEQ may call for a little Kobayashi Maru action - stack the mission deck!

Looking forward to playing it again.

4/6/10
Played to a draw. I can't believe the designers couldn't come up with a better tiebreaking mechanism than "fight the Ringwraiths." We didn't bother - I'd rather just call it a tie. Seems more thematic, anyway.

9/7/10
I have to knock this down a few steps. After five plays, I've had a draw three times. Three games that, according to the rules, are supposed to have ended with a lame fight against the Ringwraiths. 

You play a three-hour game on this gorgeous map doing all this really complicated planning and that's how this game ends 60% of the time? Oh no you didn't! Note to FFG designers: finely balanced is good, but making a margin for draws this wide is a recipe for frustration. Enjoy your six, MEQ.

Seriously, people. Look at your ratings and your comments. "This game is dull, slow-moving, not in the least bit fun. You spend all your time doing pointless stuff and never feel like you have accomplished anything. I give it a '7'." Out of curiosity, what exactly is it about this game that makes you folks "want to play" it?

Oh, and kudos to all you folks who have offered up "I haven't played it, but I opened the box and that was enough to give it a '9'."

For my part, the huge amounts of downtime and the immensely dull gameplay cannot be overcome by the very slightly interesting multifunctional aspects of the cards. Might be slightly fun playing Sauron because you don't get that powerless feeling, but yawn and shrug really seem to sum up the play overall.

Liked the art work. Liked the quests. Liked the life pool concept.  Didn't like the combat system.  Was also disappointed by the event and encounter mechanics.  For those decks, you typically pull three cards and only play one.  For the encounter deck, it's the lowest numbered card that also matches your location. This often resulted in nothing much happening. The encounter and event decks had a lot of potential to make the game feel thematic, but they failed at that.

The game rules may seem a bit confusing at the beginning, but after the first game all becomes clear. 

The two possible roles provided (hero or Sauron) offer two completely different gameplays, which plays in favor of MEQ. The feelings of a Sauron player (seeing how your power dramaticaly increases throught the game as the different pieces of your plan are put together) have nothing in common with his heroic counterparts (heroes move from the quietness of the first turns to the nightmare of the endgame, when the Dark Lord power seems completly overwhelming).

Moreover, different heroes require different play styles to be efficient, and different party members have to work together if they want to have any option of success.

In my group, the more we play the more we realise how poor was our play in our first 3-4 games, and nowadays I amb beginning to think than we would need around 10 more games to be really competent MEQ players. All in all, replayability shouldn't be an issue here. 


The game works smoothly, and the theme completelly shines (in fact, answering the question "How was your game yesterday?" feels more like telling a story than explaining a regular game night). In addition, game mechanics are really clever (I am really keen on the combat system, a kind of rock-paper-scisors that strongly reminds Yomi), and, at least in our case, downtime is not a problem -hero turns are typically fast, and during Sauron turn heroes need to be focused on the Dark Lord actions to decide their future steps-. Both possible roles (Hero and Dark Lord) are fun and interesting to play.

Despite all said, the endgame has a major problem. In case certain conditions are met, the game ends with a single battle. A battle which is, in addition, less strategic that any other one, since the Dark Lord doesn't have the option of killing its oponent, and the heroes only win the game if they kill their rival. Taking into account that neither Sauron nor the heroes can consistently prepare this battle, sometimes it feels like deciding the outcome of a 1:30-2:00 game completely at random. 

Fortunatelly, there are some user variant posted in the forum which more or less solves this problem, making this last battle a bit less annoying.

All in all, a very good game with terrible endgame mechanics. If you think you could resist this drawback, give it a try. You won't be disapointed.

The first play will take a fair bit of time as one gets acquainted with the system and the details of the game.  However, we found the game play fairly intuitive on the hero side and the conflict system was quite different and entertaining (although it appears that monsters don't defend well...).  In the fight system, there is an attack and defense value on cards as well as a strength value that is required to use the card.  In the fight, you can only play a number of cards that total up to your strength and then you are helpless before the enemy.  Pretty clever actually!  I will be curious to see how future plays will play out with us understanding what needs to be done now (both on hero and Sauron sides).  I am looking forward to giving it another play!

This game is ripe for an expansion.

Great example of a decent game that would actually be played if it were shorter and had more elegant rules. None of the complexity or length enhances the experience. Plenty of other games deliver more narrative, immersion, depth, and glorious asymmetry in less time with less rules overhead. I am including Mage Knight in this list, because its base rules are intuitive and memorable, and its difficult rules don't ruin the game if you forget them. (And they are EASY to look up!)

Good: Concept, asymmetry, character building, adventure, feel and flavor. It provides the heroes with a nice adventuring, risk/reward, and character building experience. Sauron has an interesting challenge extending influence, bluffing, and using his monsters and minions effectively, and generally being a jerk in the optimal way.

Bad: Rules are too long-winded, fiddly, and difficult to remember (the game is not fun enough to justify it), ambiguous situations happen all the time that are difficult to look up because the rule book functions very poorly as a reference, game is too long, and the conclusion is usually confusing and lame. It is often very close, and very difficult to lawyer/interpret the rules to figure out if there is a clear winner or a tie. Fantasy Flight heroes have stupid names. There are surprisingly few  objective cards, and their difficulty is not balanced.

Really bad: No women except the two player characters. Not even Galadriel makes an appearance, even though she would have been a perfect advisor standee. Way too conspicuous an omission.

Fun game.  Much better 3p rather than 2p.  Playing 2p as the "good guys" often feels hopeless....which I guess models the story line, but doesn't promote getting it to the table.

The game/rules/cards have a little too much going on, and so it is a hard game to pick up again if you have had much of a break from it.

An epic game that takes about 3-4 hours to play.  It is a one against many game, where Sauron is attempting to advance plots and Heroes are attempting to thwart them.  The rules are a little fiddly but not difficult.  Heroes use cards to move about Middle Earth gathering favors and using those favors to stop plots.  If you have played Arkham Horror, this has a similar feel but plays in a reasonable amount of time.  

The combat system is very cool with card play.  I really enjoy playing Sauron or the Heroes.  Some people don

The only drawback is that the game really needs an expansion with more starting and advanced quests for the Heroes.  It could also use some additional plots for Sauron.  Both need additional alternate secret objectives as well.  But the game is pretty re-playable as it is.  Another issue is that the game does not work well with 4 players (3 versus 1).  Sauron is almost certainly going to lose against 3 characters.  Also the two player rules where a character can move twice is difficult for the Heroes since Sauron can spread out his plots and make it difficult to shut them down.   3 player (2 versus 1) is the sweet spot.

Different ratings depend on how well you know the background and the position you're playing:
If you knows Middle Earth well and playing Sauron: 8 or 9. You really get deep into the game and drives the good players here and there trying to countereact your plan. No game designed with the same background gives you a better feel. And this is extremely likely the position to be adopted by the game-owner, as he can keep a few redundant rules to himself and don't teach to other players.
If you knows Middle Earth well and playing the good guys: 6. Partly because you're Mr anonymous, partly because you don't act like a team, rather like individual players. And the theme of those quest cards is not that much, anyway.
If you knows little about Middle Earth: 4. The game is just too long and the fighting mechanism, which seems great at first, soon becomes 1 of the few moments enjoyable as the theme doesn't matter to them and the downtime between players is too long.

BTW, this game is designed for 3 players, otherwise the downtime would simply intolerable.

This feels like the game Arkham Horror should have been - while they share a number of mechanics, in this game the rules are elegant enough that players can focus on enjoying the theme. Furthermore, having one player be the bad guy makes for a level of competition and tension that is absent in straight-up co-ops. The card-based movement and combat makes for interesting hand management choices, while the dice-free combat leads to bluffing and second guessing - way more interesting, and all about skill.

This one is hard to get to the table often, in part because of the set-up time, but mostly because my regular group don't dig these games the same way that I do.

I like the theme. I dislike some of the Sauron cards that can abruptly transport player characters around the board or end their turn. Hero movement is costly and, in a race against time, being moved somewhere against your will can be a game breaker. Personal quests can also be more of a distraction than beneficial. Wish there were more items for the Heroes. And I wish the end game conflict (Hero vs. Ringwraiths) was more logically tied in with the theme.

This one hits so many right notes for me that I'm pretty sure increased play will drive it up to a 10. It wisely uses the only timeframe that is close to the book without running the danger of creating silly pseudo-(pseuso-)histories, which satisfies the Tolkien buff in me. And it successfully melds an adventure game with a strategic battle, and all in less than 3 or 4 hours. What's not to love?

RATING: 6
This game is really OK. It's seems balanced and the theme is well integrated in the rules.

Still, this game is not my cup of tea. My two perceived negatives (after only one play) are:
1. (This maybe just this first game) When playing your characters, you just walk around a bit. I didn't feel I had something urgent to do. Simply doing nothing seemed to be a good option most of the time. Your goal is to sit out the time (9 rounds) and try to prevent Sauron from growing too powerful and catch up with you. Perhaps that was caused by the relative easy mission we had got (obtaining 5 favors). Or by the misfortune of Sauron, who really could not make a fist.
2. I was a little bored during the game. Not much action was going on. The game seems a little too long and too complex for what it is. I think I prefer a game like Talisman or Heroquest in that sense.

The good thing is that the fighting is not just rolling dice, but playing cards that give you a wide range in options: melee or ranged, offensive or defensive, anticipating your opponents move or your own next move.

After 'enough' plays this game is done. Not bad but limited replayability due to several factors - the heroes are too much alike and the development of these characters is often simply how much favor they have. Played with the alternate ending (uses missions as tiebreaker) which helped. I doubt I will play this one again.

RATING: 7
A deep malice is slowly creeping across Middle Earth. Hidden in the shadows of Mordor, he constantly seeks out his lost ring of power, the One Ring. A malign corruption is also spreading across the land, and one by one, the leaders of the Free Peoples fall to his will. A great army of orcs is forming in the far North, among the desolate ruins of Gundabad and Angmar and sinister men are marching across the desserts of the East, all holding up the banner of the dark power long thought dead. Sauron has returned. 

Cooperative game of good versus evil where efficient card management, action and resource allocation may mean the eventual end of the One Ring or of Middle Earth

RATING: 7
After I finally played this game, I'm starting to understand the comparisons being made to Arkham Horror. You are very much guided by the state of the board and the choices seem to be a bit obvious (at least in terms of where to move to and what to accomplish). The plot cards and random events just seem to force you in certain directions and it really detracts from questing, building up your character or meaningful cooperation between heroes.

Fortunately, the combat is much less luck dependant and less fiddly than in Arkham Horror. I rather like the idea of how lifepoints, damage, fatigue, movement and training are all handled with one deck of cards. Very good idea, but one that could use some additional variety in the cards/decks.

Like in Arkham Horror I'm also not too keen on the final stage of the game. In Arkham Horror, a final battle was something to avoid because you would lose 90% of the time and here it seems like I would want to avoid the final battle because it would seem a bit bland to determine the end with just one more battle between one(!) hero and one powerful minion.

I'd like to play this again as a Sauron player to see how interesting this is.

Asymmetrical adventure/strategy game for LoTR. Some of the best Ameritrash ever. There are a lot of rules, and you will need to reference them often until you are familiar with them, then the game opens up. This may not be worth the trouble for folks who don't love Tolkien. For those who do it will be a well rewarded effort. It would be rated higher, and see more play, if it wasn't so darn long. Well, that and the end-game is slightly disappointing.

A beautifully produced game from FFG.  Tons of cards and bits, to the point where I can see how some would apply the dreaded adjective "fiddly."  It all works for me, however.  I really enjoy the asymetrical game play.  It's more fun to play Sauron than one of the heroes, to be sure, but the game is great from any angle.  For me, the only real drawback is the dreadful writing in the rulebook's introduction and on the game's cards; the old Professor, as a lover of language, must be spinning madly in his grave.  But that's a quibble.  This Tolkien fan gives MEQ 2 thumbs way up.

Lots of mechanics acting together. A lot of familiar parts (encounters and favors (like clues) a la Arkham Horror, battle cards a la lots of games). It all seems to work fine but it doesn't feel fresh.

This could be a good game, but my first play (with 4) left me quite unsatisfied. Got pretty much stuck with 2 corruptions, Sauron kept on taking away my favors to get rid of them, etc.

For such a very long & thematic game I'd like to have a bit more control, otherwise it might just have been the usual Ameritrash. (And yes, the 3 heroes did communicate about what to do, it just didn't work out that way.)

Initial rating is how I feel about the game after just played it for the first time. (For what it's worth: I really like FFG's Starcraft and Red November. And I enjoy the thematic Arkham Horror)

It might have been this particular session as both the experienced players stated this was a curious game, but I don't feel the urge to play another 4 hour session of this when there are so many other long thematic games that I've enjoyed. Hence the low rating.

Rules are a definite highlight - clear and remarkably free of glitches for a game with lots of rules. Played two solo games so far, 2 and 3 player. Painted up the minis - they looks great that way. I really enjoy the narrative of the game, with peaks and troughs giving it a cinematic feel. Last game the Gondor noblewoman had to enter Baradur to fulfill her advanced quest and thereby win the game (on the second last turn, they good team had the finish quests mission and they were ahead on the story track). She had zero cards left in hand and only a few in the life pool. Drawing the peril cards decided the game - she survived to give the game to the good guys - great fun.

Woohoo! Arkham Horror style narratively driven gaming in Middle Earth. Great, tense, thematic game based on two plays. More, more, more! I have no idea how to be the evil guy, but it's really fun playing a hero. LOTR equals goodness. That's just how it is. I await the arrival of LOTR: Dwarven Latrine Inspector so that I can test the theory. Report forthcoming.

Bottom line: This game rocks, and it's almost Jessica Alba beautiful. Almost. Let's not get carried away here.

Interesting combat system.

Rating currently just a place holder as this could easily be a lot higher.  really like the 'adventury' feel to this.  some elements nicely borrowed from Arkham Horror and it does a good job of keeping the story moving while giving players options.

I played as the heroes in the first game and really enjoyed it (4p game).   Initial thought is that this will scale really well, but I think when playing 2 player I would elect to have the hero play 2 heroes just to have more occuring on the map.  

I did not have any of the mentioned problems about trouble locating places on the board.  I think the grouping regions by gem color works well.  In our first game there were a couple of questions regarding card text, but there seemed to be an easily reached consensus on how it should play (maybe it was just because I was playing with 3 excellent gamers).

Rulebook is great.  FFG is really getting the process down with these big box offerings.  There is a lot going on in MEQ (as can be expected with an FFG large box offering), but I found everything VERY intuitive.   I cannot emphasize enough - THANK YOU FOR THE INDEX!!!   What little we had to consult the rulebook for situations - it was easy to locate.

Initial playing time is probably going to be 3-4 hours (get the playaids here, they will help expedite the turns) and includes probably 15-30mins for rules (I am guessing this would shrink 30ish minutes per player under 4).  This is also with players trying to move things along.  However, I expect that 2 player games will likely fall to a 2 hour gameplay with each additional player adding 0-30mins to that total.

I cannot wait to see what FFG does expansion wise.

****** Update Dec 2009

Still interesting.  Great experience game but there are a few interesting decisions scattered around.  Heroes really start to feel like a punching bag by the 3rd age.  Does capture the epic feel as the heroes really do feel like they are battling an expanding threat to middle-earth.  

Not a game that I want to play over and over again, but well worth 3-5 plays a year.  Expansion possibilities could be great and I would definitely like to see a bit more quest/event variety.  

Rating will settle in the 7.5-8 range.

Even though it might essentially be considered Arkham Horror in Middle-Earth, MEQ is somewhat more than that. It's a deep game, and still quite easy to get into. Of course, it's got nice production values. It's one of those games that create great stories, and I really like that.

Cracking, epic game that moves along quickly once you've got the rules down. The way the game works in phases makes it easy to teach, just go through a phase at a time and soon you're flying. I love the combat card system, and the plots for Sauron. It seems the heroes always have a fire to put out and so many choices. The only real negative for me was the slight anticlimatic ending, but all that goes before makes it well worthy of your several hours. I am happy that FFG has the balls to make games like this.

I wanted to like this. I really did. It's consistent in style, mechanics, production, etc with other games I like - Android and Arkham Horror, for example. I mean I really tried to find the fun here. And I can even admit that there is actually, a fun *idea* for a game here, great art, neat mechanics.

But the downtime between turns killed it for me. 

Why?

Without exaggeration or hyperbole: if I can get up, go to the bathroom, get another beer, browse the game shelf, then the bookshelf, then the DVD collection, then go back to the bookshelf, then pull a copy of Fellowship of the Ring off the bookshelf, then sit down and get seven or eight pages in BEFORE IT'S MY FUCKING TURN AGAIN, then the game is, ahem, BROKEN. Seriously. Grindingly slow. And again, they did a good job capturing the theme, the mechanics are fun, everything feels balanced, there is enough trivia and attention to detail that as a LOTR fan I was amused. 

But I could TAKE A POWER NAP before I got to do something or interact with the game in some way again. 

What's worse, there was no game process or mechanic that would allow me to positively or negatively influence or affect the outcome or occurrences or actions of the other players' turns. I was a mute and powerless spectator as lots of only-somewhat-thematically-interesting, and worse, basically meaningless (in terms of game play decisions that would affect my turn) crap happened. So therefore, there was absolutly no incentive to focus or pay attention. In fact, I repeatedly was able to get up from the table, wander around, come back, and spend less than three seconds figuring out what changes had occurred on the board between my last turn and the next one. So it was like five minutes of game play, for every twenty-five to thirty minutes of twiddling my thumbs. 

I really don't have any desire to play this again.

I've been eager to try this since I first heard of it, well before it was released. I finally managed it last night and am somewhat disappointed. Some of it I love, the pieces are beautiful and well made and yet are difficult to use. With so many different card decks why not write the names on the backs of some, why not put the name of the creature on the monster tiles. Such graphic choices made our first game confusing at times. At times the sense of being on a fantasy quest seemed quite tangible and sometimes it just felt odd. The outcome seems to hinge greatly upon the luck of drawing an easy mission card and a final battle that seems kind of like tossing a coin after a very long preamble. I really want to love this game and want to try it again with the benefit of better rules knowledge.
A second play has done nothing to improve my opinion.

Fine enough, a fantasy tolkenian adventure, but somehow there is something missing. Great feelings: few epic battles, long adventures in the Middle-Earth, but for the heroes there is not a real feel of danger (they just respawn) so sometimes it's better to die than to keep fighting.
But nonetheless, as Sauron, I've always won.

Fine with 3-4 players; with 1-2, [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/77423/lord-rings-card-game]LotR LCG[/url] is better.

Innovative at the same time as being derivative.  Favor is very much like the AH clue tokens....how they exactly break up Saurons plots I don't know.  No character-specific encounters.  I don't like the inclusion of the Mouth of Sauron or the Southron leader...feels very off to me. And could FFG have not found actual heroes from the books...Elrond's sons, etc? The stand-ins feel very bland.  Lastly, the end fight is absurdly anti-climactic and wrong in every way.  It doesn't even make any thematic or story sense, and seems to be a huge complaint with the game.

Still, I really appreciated it and would trade for it.  But I expect an expansion soon to fix the more egregious errors.  Not a bad effort, guys!

Played it twice now and theres a lot to like about MEQ. Its got hidden missions (with all the attendant bluffing), hidden foes (monsters) and player asymmetry. The game really reflects a struggle by the Free People to delay Sauron's attempts to take over Middle Earth. 
The real standout feature is the hero's combined combat/health card system - it works brilliantly. All the mechanics feel like the best of breed from FFG (eg Arkham Horror, Fury of Dracula, Android, Starcraft, etc).

My only reservations is that the final combat mechanism feels a bit of a kludge but it is consistent with the goals of the game because the gap between the teams on the story track will influence the final battle. Also, there is a fair amount of downtime between player turns, especially if Sauron intervenes heavily, although the other players always seem drawn in to watch the focal player's activities. 

I think FFG have created the perfect game for 3-4 players who want to sit down for 3-4 hours and immerse themselves in the Middle Earth milieu. Like most FFG games, Europurists probably won't like MEQ's but it is an excellent Ameritrash/Eurogame Hybrid.

RATING: 8.8
With the Tolkien theme which appeals greatly to me, I ordered this as soon as copies were released to the UK. Fantasy Flight has produced a really good quality game which when set up for play will be a real test for those people without a full size snooker table in their homes! The detail and theming on the cards is tremendous and really adds to the enjoyment of playing. 
It is set between the time of The Hobbit and the start of The War of the Ring, with Sauron is spreading his influence out from Mordor and trying to recover the One Ring. One player takes on the role of Sauron with upto 3 other players taking on good characters. The game is basically a race game, good vs evil, where each side is trying to move its markers along a story track whilst completing an end game condition for victory. 
There is a lot going on in the game with quests, plots, corruption, influence and combat. It is the combat system that I think works incredibly well, being card based and without dice removes the "lucky roll" unbalancing the result. 
With a play time of between 2-3 hours, once you are used to the phases of each turn the game is straight forward and you can immerse yourself in the machinations of Middle Earth. Recommended for those Tolkien fans out there and anyone who enjoys a really well themed game with plenty to think about.

I think if I had played this back when it first came out, I would have said that this is one of the greatest games in Fantasy Flight's line. As it is, the scope of it is certainly epic. They don't make enough games like this anymore. The game itself, however, felt a little too long and convoluted for what it is. Playing as the heroes isn't nearly as interesting as playing as Sauron, though most of the time you'll be sitting around as Sauron while the heroes take their turns. This is a fun game for what it is, and I definitely like it more than War of the Ring, but I don't know that I would play this over Knizia's Lord of the Rings, or even the LCG. Plus the fact that this takes place during a time of rising tensions rather than during the bulk of the Lord of the Rings trilogy makes it feel slightly insignificant.

Can you tolerate a superb game of asymetric adventure & strategy that somehow completely botches the endgame resolution? The answer to that question will essentially define whether you consider this one an unjustly maligned game and a cult classic or a failed and bloated attempt at expanding the Middle Earth license into locations better left alone.

RATING: 7.5
In this 2-4 player game, one player is Sauron, and the other players are heroes. To win the game, one side has to advance their story marker to achieve 'dominance" and satisfy a dealt out goal to win. If neither player can satisfy their goal, then a duel betwen a selected hero and the ringwraiths results. On Sauron's turn he spreads evil influence, places monsters, moves minions, plays shadow cards to hamper the heroes or plays plot cards to advance his story markers. The heroes move to achieve quests to gain favors, which help remove Sauron's plots. A hero has a deck of cards, which counts as his life, and the cards can get expended in combat and moving. 

It does clock in around 3 hours, but I was fully engaged in my one game. I am looking forward to more plays, to see all the different strategies and different cards. Rating could rise with more plays.

RATING: 3
Okay, here are a few caveats before I begin:
1. We played with 4 players
2. All of the players were new to the game
3. Which, of course, meant that the Sauron player was new to the game
4. I'm not a super fanboy, but I really like TLotR and fantasy themes in general.
5. I really DISlike games like Arkham Horror, Android, and the like.

Now, I know that a lot of you, after reading ny caveats, want to shake me and tell me all the things we were doing wrong and all of the reasons why if I play it a few more times, I'll like it MUCH better.

But you know what? We have about 600 games in our collection that we like a lot, and there are at least a couple of THOUSAND other games out there that I'd love to try. And of course, we don't game every day or anything close. On average, we have an all-day session once a week, and we're going to try and devote more time during the weeknights to some gaming. That's a pretty good amount - not as much as some, but a LOT more than most - but it's still limited.

If you've read this far, then, you probably know what I'm going to say next - a game better have a pretty darn good first impression if it wants to have ANY shot of hitting the table again!

Middle-Earth Quest fails for me on so many levels. It's a l-o-o-n-n-g game that requires the players (especially the one playing Sauron) to be familiar with the rules. There is also a lot of downtime between turns. This is a BIG factor for us. I am not a fan of downtime, but Michelle absolutely DESPISES it. With all of these problems going in, the game had better serve up some super gameplay to make up for it. Here's a brief rundown of our game.

After about 45 minutes of set-up and rules reading we were set to go. Sauron did some stuff that took a few minutes, the player before me did some stuff that took another couple of minutes, I decided to head off to do my main quest which took a couple of minutes, and then the final player took a turn for a couple of minutes. Repeat a few times.

I FINALLY reached my destination of The Blue Mountains. Okay now the fun was going to get into gear! My quest? Explore The Blue Mountains! Well, explore in this case means move your piece to that spot on the board. My reward for this? A few fame counters. Please... make the fun stop... I can not take another minute...

Alright... that part was lame, but maybe the encounter card I get to draw will be a lot more fun, or at least interesting. I draw 3 cards and... none of them match where I am so nothing happens. Really?

This type of thing went on for another hour and I eventually ran into a bird-monster of Sauron's just to try and wake myself up. I win the combat (I was the Dwarf, by the way) in 2 rounds of "exhillirating" combat (note the use of quotation marks to indicate sarcasm).

Some other stuff that was slightly more interesting happened, but no where NEAR enough to stop us from calling the game after 2 hours and spending the next 15 minutes putting all the cards and chits back into bags.

Would I try this game again? Yes, but only if I were the only new player of the 3 (not 4), and the Sauron player was experienced, and both of the other players were in love with game, and they would both be willing to agree to quit after 2 hours if I said the word. Any takers?

After one play, I think this is one of the better co-op games. The team has an overall goal, but there are also smaller goals that each player has that let them power up their character. I get the feeling that after many plays, it might get somewhat formulaic, but that's true of most co-op games. The variable victory goals might make for better replayability.

This game is really nice, but when playing the heroes you have the authentic "lord of the rings-we'll never be able to win against Sauron"-feeling. I like this in a movie, because of the tenseness, but it's not my favourite in a game, except it is a cooperative one :-)

A beautifully wrought game that is perhaps another FFG triumph of style over substance. But it is playable and there are things to like. The word that springs to mind that summarises this game though is "imbalance". The Sauron player (that the heroes are competing against) gets all the good stuff - choices on cards to play, when to play interrupts, where to sprinkle baddies on the board, when to move them, how fast to power up so as to play even badder cards, they get to play in every combat, etc. In contrast, the poor heroes are mere serfs who exist so as to allow Sauron to have an interesting game. They may have a quest or two to do (ie get to that place over there), and other than that they get to play whack-a-mole, reacting to the monsters and plot/events that Sauron places on the board, trying to kill them off as fast as he puts them out. Combat is a drawn out process, simultaneously revealing cards which show your attack and defence with hit points the difference. It's an interesting process if you're in it, and works fine, but has the downside of producing too-long downtime for everyone else (but not Sauron of course). On the plus side, at least you have choices about what to do each turn and there is some co-planning required between the heroes on what to target and who's going to target it. The rewards are pretty weak though, exacerbating the whack-a-mole feeling rather than getting a real sense of progression. There's some thought required on moving (which uses up the same cards that you'll need in combat) and managing your card deck (how and when to get back your spent cards, but helping Sauron when you do), so it's not all about just the fighting like so many other ride games, and that, together with Sauron having a pretty interesting time, is a reason I rate it a notch higher than the usual. Still, it's not a game I'll be requesting more than occasionally, with theme and components being the major draw factor.

After a few goes now, I can say that this is nowhere near War of the Ring. I like this game a lot, but the theme is too dependent on the flavour text. in War of the ring you see the story happening as the Shadow-armies increase in size and start marching all over the place as the free-people armies try to withstand in their fortresses. You see how the Nazguls fly around and how the fellowship tries to make its way due South.

Here, if I don't read the plot-card the Sauron-player puts in the tower, it's just a marker to which I have to move the heroes and for which I need to pay X tokens to take off the board.

It's a great game and it looks very good, but given the choice, I'd rather play War of the Ring.

Great game nevertheless with a few nice choices for either side.

Excellent game. Really handles the 'many vs. one' aspect well, and is completely asymmetrical, which is quite intriguing. Game is full of choices, both tactical and strategic. It of course has the FFG standard of random events, but the system they have in place kind of massages the randomness to give whoever is behind a bit of an edge. Not a rubberband edge (like the CPU in Mario Kart), more of a little nudge that you might be able to exploit if you're clever. People complain about the final battle. Here's my take: I like it! The fact that being ahead on the story track gives an advantage is great. I actually wish it was slightly tougher for the heroes to win that final battle, but as it stands, I think it's an awesome exclamation point on the game. I will point out a few things I consider minor flaws, however. 1 - I think the penalty for a hero being defeated in battle should be steeper. Same as healing plus a free move to a haven? That's almost a reward! 2 - The minis are really brittle. Stuff breaks off of them at a consistent rate. Other than these two niggles, this is one of the best games I've ever played.

EDIT: Those things that I once thought were flaws are actually not (except the brittle pieces; that one still stings). The penalty for dying is fine. I totally forgot that beating them down also lets you spread influence equal to the bad guy's wisdom. 
Also, the final battle is not easy for the heroes at all. The last few times I've had to fight the Nazgul with Sauron at a slight advantage and it was daunting. Game is better than I thought (somehow)!

The game looks awesome and there are a lot of great mechanics. The lack of dice is forgotten very quickly!

I think my hasty reading of rules came back to haunt me, since I think something was missing. It didn't feel a game at all, having almost nothing relevant to do. At least I found myself totally lost as a Sauron player. Perhaps this needs a reread and replay after that.

A very promising game though. If only the missions / winning conditions were more carefully thought, this would've been a blast. In current state, I'll be gladly waiting for the expansion.

Combines gameplay elements from Arkham Horror, Fury of Dracula, and Twilight Struggle.  Less fiddly than Arkham Horror, but slightly less immersion.  While there is little original material for an adventure game, the play is much more streamlined and just "feels" smooth.  If I sit down to play a longer adventure game, it will likely be this or Fury of Dracula.

Amazing game, nice atmosphere, I like to watch at it. But when we finished and got a cigarette...we haven't anything to speak about. Weird... After couple of another sessions I know where is the problem, the game is overbalanced for me. It is OK if you don't wish to play it too often. But Sauron plays always the same way. he has no other options, all decisions are just an illusions. And heroes as well. Very nice, very good illusion.

The only one non-autopilot mechanic is the fight. It works like tuned up rock-paper-scissors but unfortunately this mechanic is not as thematic (especially in combat with elephants, for example) as I would wish.

Not bad, but not great either. 

It feels like a close game by design, rather than by play. i.e. the end result will be close irregardless of how well the players play. And, the finale feels anti-climatic. 

Not nearly as complex/complicated as people suggest. It's actually a relatively simple game, but like Arkham  Horror it just seems complex/complicated in virtue of all the different piles/deck of cards/tokens

It has a great push/pull victory slide mechanic of Knizia's LOTR game, plus some Fury of Dracula map-hopping and perils set by the enemy, plus some Arkham Horror co-op closing of gates, sacrifice and lite RPG. All in all, a fun game with lots of flavor.Takes up a LOT of table space and has tons of cards. The complexity for heroes is medium (but it goes quickly), but Sauron needs to be the experienced player and needs to know twice the rules.Yet it's really driven mostly by cards, so the mechanics were simpler than when I first thought.

RATING: 4.5
1 play, 3 players (two experienced players, and myself as a noob hero).  We won as the heroes in the duel.

Unfortunately for MEQ, this just isn't my type of game and my rating reflects that.  

The system as a whole seems overwrought and delivers very few interesting moments (the battles) in the 3 hours it takes to play.  It also feels like it relies far too much on the theme to carry it and thus becomes more of a game you play to experience.  As I primarily disregard theme in most games, once the veneer is 
stripped away the game leaves much to be desired.

Additionally, the end game came down to the duel.  The battle itself was fun, but winning that way means the three hours leading up to it felt a bit wasted.

Note: I'm aware that some of the above may be due to a lack of familiarity with the game, but I'm going to go with my gut and assume that familiarity wouldn't help it one iota in my book.

If you love FF games and you love Tolkien, you have to get this one!  The board is breath taking, as are all the wonderfully designed components.  The battle system is very unique, as it uses cards instead of dice.  Those cards are also your life force and your movement points.  The heroes can level up a bit, and buy new battle cards for their deck.  The Sauron player is a blast to play, as you set up evil plots all over middle earth for the heroes to try and foil.  There are many ways to win, and the heroes have fun trying balance whether to stop Sauron or complete their own quests.  Gaining favor feels a bit like Arkham horror, and it's fun to cooperate with your fellow heroes on what to do next.  So far I've always played Sauron, and I've always won.  I'd like to play it a few more times before I say that it is too hard for a hero win.  Teamwork is the key here I think, and both times I've played the heroes kinda did their own thing.  Very cool game.

Ending can feel anticlimactic, but that doesn't ruin the game for me.

The combat system and hidden monsters popping up all over the board work just like in Fury of Dracula. The game still works and I must admit that despite a weenie lack of innovation it is probably the best that could have been done with a adventure / Ameritrash game set in Middle-Earth. The played cooperation is limited and we rarely discussed tactics as there was usually an obvious choice. While the game is far less random than other adventure games, it feels a bit more non-dynamic and stale. The events and encounters are never crucially intervening, so aren't the counselors or minions. The endgame in a draw is also oddly anticlimactic, which may very well be most crucial points of my criticism. Of course, as you might expect by a FFG Lord of the Rings game, the artwork, theme, flavour text and so forth is amazing and very enjoyable. As for now, I do prefer other adventure games (Arkham Horror / Fury of Dracula / Descent) but I am sure I have not seen the last of MEQ.

Don't get to play the FFG big (BIG) box games too often. After nearly nodding off during the long rules explanations, I got into it fairly quickly. It all makes sense, exploring regions feels satisfying and the challenge to beat Sauron is tough. But card combat against minions just takes too long - painful when you're playing with four players. Prefer a dice roll to get it over and done with and the game moving along. Story arc isn't as strong as I expected considering the truck load of event and encounter cards.

Another 1 vs All game. Combat can be very lengthy without much for spectators to do in the meantime. Order of actions for Sauron and the Heroes feels odd and is almost too complicated to memorize (always had to keep the rulebook handy). Advise finding some nice player aids. Some victory conditions for Sauron are unbalanced.

Still a very interesting co-op game. It feels a little like Arkham Horror in a LOTR setting. Playing as Sauron is a lot of fun.

Really looking forward to this since it is being designed by Cory and Christian (awesome), is similar to many of my other favorite games due to it's system with heroes adventuring and accomplishing quest while an overlord directs the forces of evil and it's based on Lord of the Rings.
What more could you ask for except hurry up and get it released.
Got it and will be trying it out next week for sure, looks great.
 So far the 2 games we've played were very enjoyable. I look forward to playing one of the heroes next time around but playing Sauron is quite entertaining.

rating after 2 plays (2pl) - 8ish (was Sauron both times)

rating might well change either way - i like a lot about it BUT doesnt feel v thematic - feels much more like a strategic game with a LotRs theme. This may not be a bad thing just a little odd. Occasionally feels a bit limited as Sauron but will take a few more plays to decide - combat is really good tho

rating after 4th play (3pl,hero) - 8ish = it is a lot of fun but it is very luck dependant - the wrong corruption card at the wrong time can really screw a hero up, as can a run of killer encounters hurt Sauron BUT it all just adds flavour and so far im enjoying it a LOT more than WotR. 

takes about 4 hours with 3ppl so far

rating after 6plays - 8/9 - am liking it more each time - the luck just adds to the flavour and makes each game memorable. the big mistake they made was putting irrelevant quotes on the cards which dont lend themselves to the game at all - also they shouldve put more effort into making the plot cards FEEL like Sauron was plotting something but whatever this is A LOT OF FUN! i cant understand y it gets so little buzz on here

RATING: 5.5
This game has a lot going on. Some pretty cool components and ideas- I like the basic idea of having your life pool being both your source of movement and battle, and I like the way that the influence of Sauron spreads from his strongholds, creating peril for the heroes. Unfortunately all of this seems to play out at a snails pace. 

Perhaps if everyone is experienced at the game and play quickly it would feel less tedious, but with relatively new players, at least, the pace of the game seems very ponderous. Everything is very slow developing as if the game is in slow motion: threat spreads slowly, combat is slow, movement can feel slow, players have little interaction with the game when it isn't their turn and there is a lot of fiddlyness with components that drags down the game to a crawl at times. There were several areas that felt like they could be streamlined substantially.

I felt like the game should award the heroes more than it did just so they could feel like they were accomplishing something instead of just surviving. Really, there is no way for the players to advance their position the game. The winning objective isn't actually accomplishing anything, as they will get to the end in the same number of turns regardless of what they do. All they are doing is slowing down the Sauron player so he can't win. This might be part of why it feels a touch boring. Playing so the other guy can't win just doesn't give me a sense of accomplishment. I didn't achieve something, I just kept you from achieving something. For instance, if the Sauron player kills a hero, he advances a token, but if the heroes kill a minion, they don't get any bonus. This gives the Sauron player a bonus for playing well, but leaves the players feeling flat. Yeah! We just killed the Black Serpent! Wait. It didn't give us anything? Anticlimactic. And even when the heroes are rewarded, the rewards seemed very minor, while the setbacks often seemed fairly major. This just seemed to add to the feel of the game being very long, while the heroes felt like they weren't really making any headway.

22-04-2014. Update after 3 plays. I still really like this game. I have played it now once with 2, 3 and 4 players. So far, my preference goes to either 2 or 3 players. I have the feeling that 2 players may favor Sauron, while 3 players may favor the free peoples.. 

It's a real shame that the game comes with such limited cards. An expansion with more cards would help reduce the predictability of the same cards showing up a bit more, but that's a small thing considered how cool the game is.

I realize that this game is not perfect, the battle with the ring wraiths should be avoided I think given that one fight determines the outcome of a 3 hour game which seems odd. But otherwise I really like it.

=================================

05-04-2014. Rated after 1 play. I just played this game after having it shelf-sitting for about 4 months. I was daunted by the task of learning the rules seeing the 36 page rulebook, but in the end the rules were not that complex. I think GREAT cheat-sheets could be made (or maybe already are to be found on the geek).

The game plays in the 17 years between Bilbo's infamous 111 birthday and Frodo setting out for Rivendel and the start of the War of the Ring. That means that you won't be playing with your typical heroes (Aragorn etc), but some FFG made up people. They are the typical Gondorian noble, Dunedain, Elf, Dwarf and Rohirrim.

Basically, the heroes play cooperatively against Sauron, and both forces try to get their story marker to the end of the game, while fulfilling their secret mission. If you reach the final space of the board first and you have fulfilled your mission, your team wins. Otherwise, a cheesy fight with the 'captain of the heroes' versus the Nazgul follows.

The game consists out of a Sauron turn, and a turn for each of the heroes. During the Sauron turn, the heroes refresh and clean some of Sauron's evil influence from the board. Sauron is then able to deploy evil plans to further his end (and further his plans to the 'final' and spread corruption.

During each hero turn, you can rest/heal depending on your location, you can move risking encounters from Sauron and you can hinder Sauron's plans by finishing quests and hindering Sauron's plans to corrupt Middle Earth. While this seems complex, both turns are easily performed and the reference is on the board for easy access. It is at times hard to remember what you can do in your turn, but it's quite repetitive so you'll start remembering early in the game. Also, the back of the rule book gives a nice overview.

Conclusion: I really like this game. It has a good LotR feel, it takes long and is involved but it delivers. Excellent game.

Very satisfying, with a rich mix of luck and strategy.  At first gloss, the only thing I was longing for was a more compelling reason to square off with beasties roaming the board (other than "they are in my way"), but after one play through I am anxious to pull this out again.

Excellent component design and artwork (as to be expected from FFG), and exceptionally thorough, well-written, organized, and helpful rules.

Still learning to play Sauron, and the rules *ARE* complicated, but this Euro-influenced resource-management game is heckfun for this Ameritrasher. Those pesky Heroes keep ruining my plans and a good monster is hard to find! Curse you all! *shakes fist*

***

No, I see the disappointment. MEQ is *NOT* Arkham Horror. Heck, it's not even a coop game. It has a "one against the party" player setup, but it's not even a dungeon quest like D&D, HeroQuest, Descent, or whathaveyou. It's not even the remotely same experience for each side: The players run around the board like an adventure game. The Sauron player is managing limited resources like a hybrid Euro-Ameritrash game.

It's very unique, but Arkham it ain't.

My only complaint is the steep learning curve, particularly for the Sauron player. Besides that though, this is a terrific game. It's deep, challenging, thematic, and tense. This is the best Tolkien board game ever designed. I really love the way it takes two games and makes them work together, without ever seeming too contrived. This is not an adventure game for those who just want to roll dice and kill monsters. This is a sophisticated strategy game, one that requires real planning.

*edit* Eventually sold off, because of how hard it was to get to the table. It's a good game, but it's probably to "clever" for its own good. The person who owns the game will always end up playing Sauron, and that's really not very much fun.

I think it's the best game set in Middle-Earth, better than War of the Ring and not as imbalanced, although still very difficult for Free People. It's also the best adventure game I played, even though (or perhaps because) there are no dice and very limited randomness. It requires much more thinking than you might expect, especially for the heroes, which is why I like it.

I really like the card system for movement/combat/injury and exhaustion - very reminiscent of the chit system from Magic Realm, maybe even an improvement on it.

Overall, the design on this feels tighter to me than other FFG adventure games such as Android and Arkham. I was a bit disappointed that it wasn't set in a completely different time from the War of the Ring, but this is a decent game. Plenty of interesting choices for Sauron and fun for the heroes.

Perhaps it is a too pretendious for what it delivers.  Maybe it is too long and the rules are writen too complicated for what it is.  Nevertheless, it is not a bad game, not as awesome as it might be considering its colossal diplay and price tag, but nice.  It is a cat and mouse game in which Sauron tries to defend his plots to conquer Middle-Earth, meanwhile the good guys are collecting favors around and then trying to destroy the plans of the Shadow.

RATING: 9
Similar in many ways to FFG's other "big story" games such as Arkham Horror.  The key difference for me is the theme -- I'm a Tolkien tool, and proud of it.

I've never been a huge fan of non-canon Middle Earth material, but it didn't bother me much here.  The flavor text is corny but not excessively bad, and the characters are more cardboard stereotypes, but they are "accurate" ones at least.  So this part is a wash.

The upside is that the game works, and seems to work well.  I've mostly played as Sauron, and at first I was a bit baffled as to how the pieces fit together.  Once you get over that, the theme comes through as well-presented and the menu of choices becomes far more interesting.  In particular, the game gets devilishly tense once players know what they should be doing.  I cannot stress enough the need (especially for Sauron) to be thinking a turn or two ahead in preparation for potential plots.

Things I Think I Like:
- The cool card management system for the heroes, somewhat stolen from Starcraft.
- Sauron's balance between influence, monsters, and plots requires subtlety and not brute force.
- The event cards provide plenty for the heroes to do, but they can easily get overdistracted by all the miniquests; so again, more choices.
- The heroes' game is not about buffing and killing, but about surmounting obstacles under a ticking clock.
- Fights are quick but not trivial.
- The map is serviceable and attractive, as are the kajillion different card decks.

I feel I got my money's worth, and the mechanics and theme work well together in a very pleasing fashion.  Recommended, especially for JRRT fans.

Only a couple of plays I'm in love with it.  Massive theme.  Really really full of it.  Reckon it'd be at it's best with 3 players though, our 4 player game took about 4.5 hours which is just too long, and the ending can be a little anti-climactic if it comes to the tie-break.

It's not a HARD game, it's just that there's a lot of thematic stuff going on, rounds, turns, phases, sub-phases kinda thing.

Love the combat system and the game has a really unique feel about it.

Highly recommended if you want a long and in-depth struggle to save Middle Earth from the rise of the Dark Lord.  Avoid it like the plague though if you want to try it with your Lost-Cities-playing partner....

Un juego del cual opino con una sola partida muy fresquita, hace dos días. Se trata de un juego de aventuras épico, espectacular en cuanto a componentes y con un trasfondo inmejorable, como es el Señor de los Anillos.

Todo está pensado para la inmersión en la historia y funcionó para las cuatro personas que jugamos.

Por rejugabilidad y duración, MEQ es uno de esos juegos para jugar de vez en cuando, cada 4-6 meses, pero para degustar totalmente la partida.

RATING: 9
The heroes play questing/character development, while Sauron plays area influence and tries to annoy and slow the heroes, so that's 2 games in 1 right there. A weakness is that the heroes can often screw (or fail to screw) Sauron unknowingly, since Sauron advances along his missions using cards (hidden information), and it can be frustrating for Sauron, especially since he can't discuss it till the end of the game. But I think there are enough things in your control to have a fun experience. There's always something to run around and do on the board as the heroes, while planning 1 or 2 turns ahead for a hard-to-stop plot as Sauron is very fun. I thought the combat system, which I had heard bad things about, was very nifty and intuitive (far better than the confusing icons and die-roll modifiers in Fury of Dracula).

There are quite a few original things to wrap your head around, but most of it is procedural, so it's fine when playing with somebody familiar. Theme can help you persevere (as it usually does when I learn rules-complex games like Battlestar Galactica and War of the Ring), and once you do, there's good adventure to be had. It also helps that there are a lot of fresh mechanisms in here. I like Sauron's actions (be balanced, as each action type yields diminishing returns), the multi-choice cards (use either for movement or combat, reminds me of War of the Ring), and I love the draw, rest and damage pools, and strength during combat. I wonder if the designers played WWE Raw Deal before, because the draw-deck-as-health concept, and using your played combat cards to keep track of your strength, are all very reminiscent of that very underrated CCG, and I have never seen them implemented in any other board game.

Very streamlined, intuitive and quick (2 hours with 3) gameplay sets this apart from other allv1 games like Fury of Dracula (the obvious inspiration) and Descent.

My concern is that this seems like a game that wows you the first couple of times, then the weird victory conditions* and lack of variety of cards (this game is the forgotten stepchild in FFG's empire of expansions) start getting more annoying over time. Also a little annoying when rules and FAQ don't cover edge cases, or don't mesh in an intuitive manner, making you wonder if the designers overlooked them.

Sorely needs an expansion for more variety, and I hope they expand upon the Training/deck-building concept, which MEQ tentatively dipped its toes in, before Mage Knight implemented it as a full-fledged mechanism.

Devised a [i]much[/i] more intuitive way to explain the victory conditions.
 - Game end triggers when one side reaches Finale/Shadows Fall
 - You can get 2 points
 - 1 point for reaching the Finale/Shadows Fall
 - 1 point for completing your mission
 - You only win instantly if you got 2 points and your opponent did not
 - If the points are tied or nobody reached 2 points, fight a final combat, with the difficulty adjusted by spaces away from the Finale.

5+4

After six long years of owning this and never playing it, we finally got this to the table and I thought it was a blast.  The personal quests are cool and the mechanics that Sauron has at his disposal are also pretty neat.  Combat isn't as prevalent as you would think, but when it happens, there is some gamesmanship to it as well.  Good fun!

This game has gone from my shelf to where it will be more appreciated and I hope it got the home it deserves. 

Why I sold it off: 
1. It wasn't what I expected - I expected something similar to AH as it shares many mechanical similarities. What I wanted was a game of thematic in character immersion and MEQ is not about that. Immersion is not even possible because the game incorporates a "clever" (ymmv) combat & movement card system. In order to get the most out of it you must devote quite some thought into it. Which means you cannot devote this mind space to immerse yourself into theme and character. Secondly the way event cards work is different than AH - they are much more conditional meaning you'll see some much more often than others (meaning it's more samey). But even so - I tried to solo the game so I could devote all my effort into theme immersion and it still didn't deliver in this regard. So it was not made for what I wanted out of it. 
2. I considered it a bad product. It was the most expensive game I ever bought, yet... The minis were brittle and they were broken - they were since replaced, but the new ones were still brittle. Trouble is I couldn't care less about minis. Here's the catch: for me minis make sense in a dungeoncrawl scenario as the type of representation (mimetic) is the same for the space (room, cavern) and the person in the room. For a map chits make much more sense to me - as they have a stylized representation of the person on stylized representation of a place (map). Now okay, my suspension of disbelief can handle it sometimes, but MEQ uses both the minis and the chits and what the hell? (Suspension of disbelief gone). So for a huge price I've gotten an unproven game with minis that I didn't care for and didn't work for me and only inflated the price of the game and there was neither a ziplock bag included for all the chits (as obviously a box insert is too much to ask for these days). 

That's it. I understood that the game might be something else than what I expected and I've tried it again, but it didn't work even in that sense. There's also a case of downtime - half the Sauron's turn is just bookkeeping and every person is on their own and they must think what they can do with the cards. Even Android runs more smoothly. AH works better for me as simpler resolution system gets out of the way of my in theme immersion. Also Muchkin Quest was much more fun as fantasy adventure game and I'm not so eager to play it either).  What MEQ is:a game about back and forth (tug of war) and double think, but with a lot of stuff (I'll gladly take Twilight Struggle instead)

EDIT: Down to 1.0 because I never was convinced this game needed to be made at all. Please make games which are finished products, sheesh.
[hr]
A game I hated. It was the most expensive game I ever bought. Which turned out to be: an underdeveloped mess, filled with fragile minis, full of downtime and zero on narrative. 
The core of the game looks like Arkham Horror, but with an opposing player taking over an "AI" deck of cards. But. MEQ isn't about a narrative like AH. Or atmosphere. It's about "clever" tactical play entirely based on decks of cards. Even if you wanted to develop a narrative in your mind, your mind was already full of overhead and trying to wrap your head around your hand of cards and use it in a "clever" way. But even if you tried the best you could - I soloed it - there was no narrative nor atmosphere to be found. Event cards on locations too generic. Heroes completely generic. 

But, it doesn't stop here. Unlike AH where heroes have simultaneous turns, here they're one after another and this means: downtime. A lot of it. It's the kind of issue one would expect to be fixed and nonexistant in the late 2000s in a release from a major publisher. Then there's also the end game which is kinda glued on the main game and probably only a temporary fix waiting for an expansion which never came as people didn't buy enough copies of this shitty game. Surprising, innit?

But it also doesn't stop here. The visuals. The game was so expensive because of the minis. Which were - A - brittle. FFG messed something up and offered replacement minis, which were as brittle, but at least I managed to sell my copy for cheap (so good riddance). But - B - the minis were unneeded. See, the game had 3 types of representations of units. Some units were represented by chits laying down. Some were by chits in stands. And some by minis. It's just ugly - why weren't all units represented the same way? Furthermore minis clashed not only with representation type of other units, but also of the board. MEQ board, like AH board is basically locations connected by paths - and locations are represented by illustrations in circles. So the equivalent type of representation of units would be chits (laying down or standing up). Minis just don't make sense here. And final nail in the coffin - this too expensive game had no box insert to make room for future nonexistent expansions. Brilliant.

Juego de aventuras tipo Arkham Horror, pero para mi gusto mucho mas divertido, pues un jugador maneja a los mostruos y no se hace tan mecánico y aleatorio como el Arkham.
Además, el sistema de lucha es maravilloso. De lo más divertido que he jugado, muy táctico.
Lo único malo del juego el la duración de partida (como en todo este tipo de juegos) y que algunas veces te tarda mucho en llegar el turno.

Middle Earth Quest somewhat captures the feel of Middle Earth. The characters, map, and destinations are evocative of the books. The best part of the game are the battles. They are tense and exciting, similar in feel to LOTR: The Confrontation.

My rating might be a bit on the harsh side, but I have my reasons. After a couple of hours of playing, our game came down to my elf verses my opponents black riders. I drew my hand of cards for the fight, and they were not very good. Not very good at all. I don't know for sure, but it may have been mathematically impossible for me to win. That sucks! If it weren't for how little control all of my experience and quest completions earned me in the end, I would rate MEQ an 8. But come on. A weak card draw costing you the game. That just shouldn't be!

LOTR:TC is the better bang for your buck.

Seems like a great game. Shades of strategy game, adventure game, and Fury of Dracula. Nice combat system. I can see no flaws in the design, and it is a fresh, unique experience.

Don't think it's for everyone, but as someone who loves 1vAll games and appreciates the fresh and unique feel, I'm happy it exists.

I think it's a "once every now and then" game for me though. Still need to try Sauron. Downtime may be a problem.

Marco Polo Expedition meets We The People (with a little bit of Arkham Horror, of course).  Sometimes I like comparing games to other games in ridiculous ways.  There is much more to this than just those two games, but in all honesty if you've played enough games it is hard not to compare this to all the designs that they were inspired by, and they wore their inspirations on their sleeves. Still, it works.

It is a fun romp.  Great battle mechanics.  I think the cardplay is really intriguing.  Much better system that Starcraft.  The only reason that this doesn't get a higher rating is that the system offers fun actions, but the design is set up to create friction to prevent you from doing stuff.  I'm not a big fan of limiting options.  I'd rather options be presented to you that have higher risk reward rather than outright penalties.  When you limit the kinds of actions that a player can do you create a more linear exploration game, and you lose the sense of exploration and discovery.  

The topography creates fun movement puzzles. Unfortunately, there is stuff in the game that slows you or prevents you from moving, so you are effectively losing your turns and not actually taking advantage of all that is interesting about it.

And, I do have to say that I wish that there was a better ending other than the Monsters Ravage America battle.   Unlike MRA, you have the option to shape the game to end in a more elegant win, but sometimes you have to duke it out.  Fine, but then it really comes down to the luck of the draw.  You can't even manage your hand for the last battle...hrumph. I'm sure that this will be "fixed" in the expansion.

I'm sorry to say that I'm a bit disappointed in this game. Issue One is that it's just not the game I was hoping for. It's thematically thin. I feel like I'm moving tokens and discarding plot cards, not adventuring in Middle-Earth. Issue Two is that there is no way that the combat rules went through any sort of blind playtest. There are situations with card precedence and cancellation powers that make absolutely no sense if played the way the rules are explicitly written.

Played once as a character in a 4p game. I felt it had too much downtime for the 3 players and as the game went over 4 hours (from memory) this meant this game wasn't the winner I'd hoped for. Some players' turns were over in a minute and when a round takes in the order of 20-30 mins that sux. I'm sure the Sauron player had a good time given he had a lot more to do. Not sure when I'd get the time to play this again, let alone get a chance to be the Sauron player, which I'd like to do before I rate this game.

Really like the combat system.

A great adventure game in the Lord of the Rings universe! 

The good:
- great theme (Tolkien), nicely incorporated in the game: I think both sides feel pressured to accomplish their (secret) goal before time runs out!
- nice sculpts (although using a different color for the minions -- or even fully colored sculpts! -- would have been better)
- not fully cooperative (those are so boring ... hurray for eeeevil!)
- it's from FFG, but it doesn't have a bazillion chits all over the place. There are a lot of chits, yes, but it's not the mess you see in Runebound, for example.
- heroes' life pool/damage/rest card/hand-management mechanism
- Sauron's action selection: can do a little of everything pretty well, but it's harder to focus on one type of thing (which you may need to do to complete your goal)
- combat mechanism: rock-paper-scissors, sort of, but taken several notches up and made much more interesting
- game play is actually pretty straightforward

The bad:
- rulebook organization sucks! Well, maybe -- I didn't actually read it myself!
- better player aids should have been included
- colored/painted sculpts missing
- learning game took a LONG time, and we still missed some rules (some we don't even know about!)

Fun game with some fiddly end-game conditions. One vs. all and I like that you don't have to hold back as either side. Overall, it didn't get played much & I'd rather play a co-operative adventure game or a competitive Euro/Area control game over this, especially given the 3-4 hour playtime.

RATING: 7
I liked it. There is an interesting hand management aspect--there are no dice, but you have the same cards for movement and combat (and health). The heroes have a lot of interesting choices running around fighting Sauron's influence or monsters or doing quests. It was a bit slow but I think that would improve with experience. (4h for 3 players).

Comments based on one solo run through.

Rules very clear and well written. Despite rules length it does not feel like a very complicated game. There are a lot of mechanics but all simple and superb. 

Feels like there will be expansions. Much prefer to Runbound (my only other game of this typei have played).

Not coulr blind friendly at all but easy to work around.

Components top notch. 

Loads of options but not bewilderingly so - the quests and event cards steer you a little bit. 

The character life deck is genious, really tough to decide whether to push to push on or 'rest' and give Sauron a boost. 


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Sweet mechanics.  Only misses a 10 by being a tiny bit fiddly. 

We actually prefer this as a two-player game, with the Hero player not using the rules provided, but instead simply running two Hero characters.  You then follow all the rules of a three-player game, such as the Shadow player being able to play a Shadow card on each of the two Hero characters.  We do play that the Hero player cannot look at the second Hero character's cards until his first character's turn is over.

I've played twice now, and had fun both times, but not enough to warrant the time spent absorbing a 40 page rulebook, and a playing time in excess of 3 hours. I expect a deeper and more interesting decision set for that level of investment.

I've been a hero in both games I've played, and I do see that the Sauron player has a lot more to think about. He has to deal with the whole board, and make meaningful strategic choices. As the hero, I've yet to have a turn where the best play didn't seem obvious, and long term planning is thin at best. The cards you draw and the Sauron player's actions determine your options each turn, so your play as a hero is almost entirely tactical.

Even as Sauron, with more to think about, I don't see why I would play this when I can play War of the Ring, which has a comparable playing time, and no more rules overhead. I could see from the first time it hit the table that WotR was a brillant game, and repeated play has confirmed that impression. So why play a lesser game on a closely related theme that takes at least as much time and energy?

Perhaps my rating will rise with more play, but at this point I wish I had spent my money on something else. MEQ is a solid game, but not a great one, and I have so many good ones vying for table time.

[1 play] Initial reaction rating.  I am a big Lord of the Rings fan and really wanted to like this game.  Early on it seemed exciting and fun.  But as the game progressed it just got slower and more boring.  The quests really are just moving from one location to another, and traveling is difficult, slow and tedious.  Sauron's main objective is to slow your travel down as much as he can.  It took a long time, our characters really did nothing sucessful.  You don't get new items, and really barely level up.  We didn't complete all our quests or our objective, or even disrupt the Sauron plots... yet we won because we defeated the ring wraiths in the final battle.  The quests, the rewards, and the end game just all left a bad taste in my mouth about this game.  One play is not enough to say that I hate the game certainly.. maybe I just had a bad play, I would be willing to try it again and see if my opinion changes.

It's like a lighter Arkham Horror for the Heroes, and like a resource based CCG for Sauron. Downtime is noticable with three Heroes; 2 vs 1 is a marked sweet spot. Better than Arkham despite the lack of cards and variety.

I love how it creates a sense of adventure, complete with dramatic twists and interesting outcomes. I would love to see this on a larger scale with say 6 heroes and 2 bad guys all out and about doing there own thing. The pre-book setting is perfect for creating tales without relying on too many of the usual ME tropes. 

The primary problem lies in the downtime created by the difficulty of analyzing card options along with the turn sequence. Some form of simultaneous play or partial turns would have helped greatly. A close second are the weird game end conditions which make no sense to me. I'd rather just leave it undecided.

Good game dripping in theme. You really feel like a hero running around keeping things from escalating out of control.
Two (minor) gripes: 1. remove victory condition for 'good guys' that they have to follow all their standard & advanced quests: that can really break a game for some players as all they do is run around in futility (Gimli, anyone).
2. So many decks of cards, so many components. Seems to me that could've been playtested to streamline it more.

Alas, it fell kinda flat in my gaming group. With 200+ games, that means it'll never get played if no-one else likes it (as well). So on the trading list it is.

I really wanted to like this game, but each time I play I like it less and less, and now I won't even consider playing it again. Too many times when playing a Hero I have spent half the game passing on my turn because I need to build up my card hand, or because I didn't wait to build up my card hand and got trounced. It's simply a load of downtime for what almost always feels like a very arbitrary outcome. Yuck.

Very cleverly designed game.  The rules are quite complex and convoluted and will take a few games to understand how it all works.  I found Arkham easier to get the hang of.

Great components (the board is the best board ive seen), the combat mechanic is great, and once you understand the gameplay this game will really deliver an experience. 

Alot of people seem to not like the end battle with the ringwraiths that can occur, personally i think this is fine and thematic, and ive only seen it occur once in five games.

Sauron and the heroes play completely differently.  Sauron plays like a euro game and the heroes more like a conventional adventure game.

So far, it has taken us 3 hours for a two player game, 4 hours for 3 player, 4.5 for 4Player.

It will take a few plays to understand, the first few plays will be long and, as with Arkham, these types of games are not for everyone.  Also, some of the decks are thin and could use an expansion.  But it is an extremely fun. engrossing adventure game.

Fantasy Flight need to release an expansion for this!!!

RATING: 6
My favorite game is [thing=115746][/thing] and my most played game is [thing=77423][/thing], so I was legally obliged to play this one sooner or later.  Luckily I was able to snag a copy at a swap meet and give it a try.

Ultimately it has a lot of similarities to [thing=115746][/thing].  It's a ~3 hour, asymmetric, highly thematic adventure taking place in middle earth.  The main differences are that (A) MEQ takes place before the LotR books, and (B) it focuses much more on adventure than it does on combat.  

The adventuring is very well done.  There is some good hand management related to moving around the world and planning the most efficient route.  The random events are great and thematic.  Sauron is busy laying traps while the heroes are trying to avoid the traps.  It's a fun game of cat and mouse.

But, while WotR is one of two games I have rated 10, MEQ only gets a 7.  Here's why:
 * Combat involves simultaneous card selection that's similar to rock, paper, scissors.  It has a big influence on the game, but it just feels random and unsatisfying.
 * The end game is seriously flawed.  In addition to advancing your track to the goal (kind of like getting enough VPs to win), you also need to accomplish a secret goal.  If you get the VPs but don't get the secret goal, it goes into this strange deathmatch situation where one hero fights to the death against the Nazgul.  It just doesn't make any sense.
 * It's still a very long game and requires a lot of setup.  We're talking 3-4 hours.  WotR I can usually play in 2 hours.

Ultimately I like the game and I plan to keep it, but I doubt it will get played more than once or twice a year when my wife and I have a weekend day to kill.  I think my wife likes it better than WotR because it doesn't focus as much on combat, and if she likes a game that means it stays in my collection.

I like this game. It captures the theme so beautifully, with tension building up. However I do not like the potential finale though where it could all be decided on a fight if honours are even. Only played once but next time I thin we will try a two or even three missions to decide the winner.
Other than that this game works very well, is finely balanced and enjoyable. Hope to bring down the game time from 5 hours once we play a couple of games (this written after one play)

RATING: 7
The only real downside here is game length. Middle-Earth Quest is long, as in you might sprout a beard between the time you start and finish. Could four experienced players finish a game in the advertised three hours? Possibly ... but I'm guessing most games are going to clock in at more. Such length brings my rating down a peg (a game has to be simply fantastic to last more than two hours and get anything near regular table time for me). My only other complaints are that it's far more interesting to play Sauron than one of the heroes, and downtime between turns can be too long. The good outweighs the bad in Middle-Earth Quest, though. The theme is rich and meshes well with the game mechanics. There is room for players on either side to be creative and the map and miniatures are nice. And, even if the game is a tad longer than I'd like, I love that the heroes' story marker advances at a steady pace, ensuring that the game does wind to a fixed-time conclusion that all players can anticipate and plan  for. I suspect that a big chunk of my enjoyment of this game is my familiarity with Lord of the Rings - the map, the characters, some of the events are all comfortably familiar. Whether this stays in my collection long-term will probably depend on how close to that three-hour mark future games get. I like Middle-Earth Quest, but not enough to spend four or five hours playing.

RATING: 6
Middle Earth Quest is a semi-cooperative with a lot of cardboard.  Beneath the artful 2-piece board, 10 decks of gamemaster cards, each players' deck, and a fair number of pawns and chits lies... a fairly ordinary experience.  Setup/takedown are significant and the proceedings lack alacrity.  It's simply weighed down by all of the [beautiful] icing.

RATING: 6
A fun game with an immersive story.  However, if both sides fail to achieve their victory conditions, then the end of the game boils down to a final single combat, so the end can sometimes be a bit anti-climatic.  If that bothers you, then you should move on to another game.

My first impression is that it's a very process heavy game in which the game's gears are constantly visible.  Hopefully I can get more into the setting in future games.  I also found it difficult to grok what I should be doing, but I think I got the hang of how to play well by the end of my first game.

I do enjoy the combat cards.  Simple and fun.

RATING: 7.5
Made quite a few mistakes on my first game as Sauron that made the life of the heroes a little easier. And drawing one monster of ten tokens surely didn't help. It's not as intriguing nor as fast-moving as Mansions of madness feels. Both sides had to cope witha lot of downtime. In comparison to the keeper-play, it feels that there are way more opportunities for lost moves as the Sauron-player:
1. speaking monster tokens here - even if the monster tokens potentially hindered the heroes, when they moved into the place I either had to discard it or- if in places of peril - always chose the peril. The heroes could probably guess why Idid so. 
2. The shadowcards - after the game was over, I was thinking "Wow, there are some really wicked cards in here. Same with the plots. Had I gotten those on hand before I'd have pushed the shadow pool even more so. 

After all, this is another good, possibly very good game of FFG driven by excellent mechanics, dripping with theme all over the place and showing the best artwork in all LotR-games so far (seriously, this is the most beautiful map of Middle-earth I've ever seen in a game. From what I can tell not even the map of the deluxe edition WotR comes remotely close. And the artwork on the shadow cards is simply stunning). This game leaves a lot to explore. On both sides, the heroes and Saurons.

I've only played a few games of this but I'm really desperately hanging out for another. Thematically this is a very cool game: it's not quite LotR and it's not The Hobbit. In fact it's actually set between the two. It has a massive board (large table required) and can be a bit difficult for an in-experienced Sauron player. But despite these shortcomings I find this game highly enjoyable and I really can't wait (or find the time unfortunately) to play it again.

RATING: 5
A lot of downtime for the non-Sauron players. Elanor's quests are very hard compared to some of the others. For RPG type quest games, this one still doesn't surpass Return of the Heroes. I'm not sure it'll make it to the table too many more times.

RATING: 7
There are many aspects that I like to this "one versus many" co-op.  The combat in particular I find to be quite fun in most circumstances; unfortunately in some instances it 'breaks' a little when one side or the other is missing proper incentives.  The card management for the heroes seems fun and a good mechanism; overall though the game seems a little too "big" for what it really is, with so many beastly components that it seems difficult to get it to the table very often.

RATING: 5.5
First Impression:
A solid middle earth experience. Players do feel a bit restricted through the game, and too few things seem to happen for the time that is required. Still, the atmospere is good, the narrative that is created decent, and the battles highly interesting. Most mechanics are well intergrated to the story, and games shouldn't be repetitive.

Initial rating after my first play, would absolutely play this again.

I was surprised at how much I liked this game.  Mechanically pretty straight-forward, despite the huge amount of bits.  Loved the art style on the board, reminded me of the old-school Tolkien book covers with the muted pallette of water colors, beautiful.

Nice to have a game that WASN'T the Fellowship for a change, thought how it was cool that the game was pre-Lord of the Rings time period.

Great stuff, looking forward to playing it again.

RATING: 8.5
This one is a massive game: hundreds of cards, miniatures, a huge board, beautiful art and lots of theme.

The theme, of course, is the main attraction and one of the complaints about it: the setting is [b]Middle-Earth[/b], which you are probably aware of. The complaint: you don't get to be one of the known heroes of the stories you get Eometh, Eleanor, Argalad, Beravor and Thálin. Hum... ok. Though some of the stars (Gandalf, Boromir, Theóden, and others) do show up, they just give the Heroes some benefit (itens, favors, trainning, etc) and them are gone - sure, they can appear again, but just to do the same thing.  Well, I can live with this, since the story isn't the one in the [b]Lord of the Rings[/b], but a time-span of 17 years between the between Bilbon's 111 birthday and to the day when Frodo leaves the Shire.

The gameplay isn't clunked: the rules, though FF's style, do function rather well. I don't like that there is so much downtime between the players turns, as after one person has his/her turn, he/she will wait for the turn of the others (that can be long, with movement, ambushes, encounters, combats, etc) and of the Sauron player. Usually about 15-20 minutes of waiting. However the game is co-op, so it relies on the assumption the everyone will be focus on what the others are doing, usually to give advices and overall help.

I like - no, I LOVE - the combat, even if it can be somewhat long at times (I don't care, I want more!). It is based on the use of cards, and also uses some bluff and guesswork that I enjoy much more than rolling dices. This part is a major plus for me.

The same cards being used for movement, combat and life is really smart and well done. Basically is what Corey did later with [b]Gears of Wars[/b].

So, in the end is a solid game, that I'm pleased to play anytime is offered.

RATING: 10
Middle-Earth Quest takes place approximately ten years after Bilbo Baggins leaves the Shire, and several years before Frodo leaves Bag End on his journey leading to the destruction of the One Ring. Thus, Middle Earth Quest will take place in a time of growing darkness. Players will take control of characters such as a Gondorian Captain, a Rider from the Westfold, or numerous other character types. Not only will characters be able to experience new adventure in Middle Earth, but we will carefully seek to tie in the experience with the massive amounts of lore and story that takes place around the edges of the central THE LORD OF THE RINGS storyline.

Love the feel and theme of the game. Definite strategy on both sides. I find the end game thematic in that you've got to stop the forces of Evil from finding the Ring and battling the Ringwraiths is just that!

Two plays so far.  MEQ seems a co-op game for the good guys that doesn't involve much co-operation.  As a relative n00b I kept having to ask for advice, but I suspect that experienced players could pretty much get by in silence.  As such, a very different feel from, say, Pandemic, where only constant teamtalk will make the world healthy.  I love the game for its theme, but miss the Fellowship.

I'm a playtester for this game, so take that for what it's worth. This comment is based exclusively on the published edition, however, not on the version I playtested, which was rather different.  I like it, with significant reservations. The Sauron player is definitely more entertaining to play. He has more ability to direct the way the game will be played, while the heroes have to play a bit more reactively.  The art and components are gorgeous.  Although I had some broken figures in my box initially, I was able to glue them and they have held since. It's definitely one of the best Lord of the Rings games out there, up there with such well-regarded classics as [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/823]the co-op game[/url] and [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9609]War of the Ring[/url]. The theme is a mixed blessing. Although it's a little disappointing to not be playing more recognizable characters, it is nice that we're not just covering the same story that we've seen in so many other LotR games.

Here's an epic game that doesn't feel long.  I'm kind of impressed with it.  Still, in my (admittedly limited) play experience, it's too easy for the heroes to hunker down in Havens and then play huge turns to get everything done at once.  Maybe our Saurons need to be more aggressive...

Interesting blend of Magic Realm mechanisms (e.g. cards as movement / combat / health pool) and standard adventure game favourites (character advancement, quests, monster bashing).

Esse jogo é muito bom! Só joguei uma partida por enquanto, mas ainda quero jogar muitas!

O jogador que é o Sauron controla uma infinidade de eventos, baralhos, poderes, monstros, influências e etc, e os jogadores são os heróis da terra média, e tem que cumprir uma determinada missão até o final dos turnos.

O jogo é bem difícil, mas acho que com mais jogadores, se o Sauron mantém os mesmos poderes, o jogo fica até fácil demais.

RATING: 9
Basically what I want out of a big, sprawling adventure game. This really isn't my sort of game. I tend to like smart, concise designs with deep game play or silly and fast games with lots of dice. MEQ has some depth to it, but as is FFG's wont, it's more about tons of cards and flavor text and rules.

What makes me love it though (besides the theme), is the undeniably clever bits. The whole card management aspect, where cards represent both stamina and health, and are used for both movement and combat, is absolute genius. When you travel a long way in one turn, you'll probably be too tired to fight the monster at the other end. When you're injured, you have to rest more often.  It's thematically perfect and super clever.  The blind bidding approach to fighting, with lots of interesting effect interactions, is also great.

I also love having one player play the "game" (Sauron) instead of being randomly automated as in, for example, Arkham Horror. This just makes the whole exercise feel vastly more strategic. Portals/plots aren't popping up randomly all over the map and bad things aren't happening purely because of random card draws, these bad things happen because a clever opponent has bided his time, built up his resources, and is playing them when they're most costly and damaging to you. This makes the game nastier, but so much more satisfying to win and easier to accept when you lose.

Playing the heroes is a mostly tactical affair--you must respond (usually quickly) to the bad stuff Sauron puts in play. Because of the clever card mechanics and other moving bits, there's a fair amount of short-term planning and decision making to do here. The quests add a hint of longer-term planning, but overall, the experience is similar to playing a typical adventure game like Arkham Horror.

Playing Sauron is more strategic. You'll usually have cards in your hand that you'll want to play, but that have certain prerequisites that you don't yet satisfy. Also, those cards will often be associated with a particular location. There's a lot of long-term planning to do here, both in working towards the prerequisites, and in fortifying or drawing the heroes away from the locations that will be affected by your most important plot cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.1
I'm a fan of Middle Earth and Hobbitses and my rating probably reflects that, but for an adventure game this one fits the theme nicely.  It's also great for those who don't like wargaming conflict like War of the Ring but still want to draw out all the flavor from this particular world.  Beautifully produced by FFG as expected.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is a very fun and exciting addition to Adventure gaming.  Its a little long, but it feels like you are playing an epic game with the heroes and Sauron fighting to determine who will control middle earth.  Given the limited size of the current card pool (and FFG's love of expansions) it will be fun to see what the future of this game holds.

RATING: N/A
Fantasy Flight is still in the business of making perhaps overly complex games - this is a one vs. many quest game,  feels a lot like Arkham horror.   Lots of wheels,  although keeping all the mechanics straight is a bit tough.  Feels a touch on the needlessly/overly complex side...our rules explainer taught something new to someone who had played it before,  who in turn also taught us that we were playing a whole bunch of rules wrong.  Only thing I'm certain though is that I definitely did not play Middle Earth Quest this first go around...

Of the recent Fantasy Flight releases (Horus Heresy, Runewars, etc.), MEQ has by far the best take on card-driven combat.  The double-guessing, strength limitations, and cards-as-health mechanic are all unique stylings that add up to an attractive battle package. 

As a general theme, be prepared for Sauron to launch continuous, arbitrary evil at the heroes from beginning to end.  You'll get beat up - and like it - but that's precisely the point.  Vanquishing Sauron shouldn't be trivial, right?

The only annoyance is that there are timing bugs that pop up occasionally (with respect to combat, travel, encounters, etc.), but that's a fairly trivial complaint.  The latest FAQ deals with most rules issues nicely.

Still playing this two years later. That's a good sign.  I'll take this over [i]War of the Ring[/i] any day.

This game tries to be far too many games at once. You can play for an hour doing a multitude of 'mini-game' like tasks, hardly interacting at all with the other players, and that work will have little to no outcome on the end of the game.

[b]THE NENYA:[/b]

1. Great combat/travel/weariness system.
2. Very good fingers of evil spreading across Middle-earth influence system [takes a breath]. Badness seeps from the Dark Lord's strongholds, and is a really well thought out idea, stolen from Twilight Struggle.
3. All the great locations are present: Gundabad, Moria, the Shire, etc. Obviously.
4. Fantastic use of Barad-Dur imagery to depict Sauron's shadow pool and card piles.
5. Lovely John Howe artwork on all the cards and board spaces.
6. LoTR theme. In the arena of boardgames, LoTR hacks off the heads of less armoured pretenders!
7. Diceless game.
8. Fantastically sculpted miniatures.
9. Marvellous production values.

[b]THE ONE RING:[/b]

1. Too fiddly.
2. Difficult to judge who's winning at a glance.
3. Busy board, visually.
4. Very hard to find locations quickly, unless you [i]really[/i] know Gondor, Mordor, etc.
5. Broken models.
6. Annoying gameplay. Players pick up hordes of barnacles that slow or disrupt or upset the players, but there is no balance to counteract this. I understand that this is a plot-driven game and not Runebound, but I play games to have fun. Having very few buffs to my character after 3 hours game-time is just tepid. I want a magic sword! Or a ring, or a talisman. Please give my little bearded guy something to cherish after all the effort he's put into this quest. Something. Any bloody thing!
7. LOooooooong and slow.
8. Diceless game. Love it or loathe it; that's for you to decide.
9. I don't feel like I'm on a quest! It plays like a chaotic meandering from one random location to another, to deliver a token. And, when I get there after a year's horse ride, what do I get? Another frackin' token!
10. No chance to team up with the other players to form a fellowship or team.
11. No reward for destroying the tougher minions - and these dudes take some effort to banish, let me tell you. I, vanilla dwarf, hacked to death the entire posse of Black Riders and received zip in reward. That is crap. And it took 2 turns to do. And in a game where a turn can take upwards of an hour for it to get to your turn again, getting sweet FA for 2 turns worth of graft is a bitter pill to swallow. I banished all 9 of the Ringwraiths! Not a group of malnourished orcs. Throw me a bone here.
12. Each turn has at least one phase too many. The final phase, whereby you pick one card from three location cards seems superfluous and sluggish.
13. Slapdash and unsatisfying endgame.
14. Found myself wondering during play, how much more entertaining this would have been if it'd been combined somehow with LoTR Risk: Trilogy edition.
15. Vanilla characters, that you never connect with, or have any sense of immersion in their plight.
16. A HUGE disappointment, and a wasted opportunity.

More often than not you have to work with each other in order to remove certain obstacles on the board, which is something I felt Arkham Horror largely lacked, since seems like just a bunch of individuals doing their own thing.

The hand management aspect is a great addition to the game.  With the cards used as movement, battle and health.  It becomes really important to plan your travel, as well as to decide when to fight.  I'm not too impressed by the combat though, it has a paper-rock-scissor feel to it and is largely decided by luck more than anything else.

Great production as usual from FFG.  My biggest concern is the replayability.  Even though there are 5 hidden goals per side, I don't think there are enough varieties in the personal quests to warrant using the same character more than twice.  I suppose it's easy enough to come up with new ones in future expansions.  Anyway, Middle-Earth Quest is probably the best cooperative adventure game I've played so far.  Only took us 3 hours with rules explanation, so I think it is best if the person controlling Sauron is experienced in order to move the game along at a good pace.

Finally a FFG big box game that lives up to the hype.  Much better than Runewars, Gears of War, Age of Conan, Mansions of Madness, etc.  Lots of theme and story, but even more importantly, decent game mechanics and meaningful decisions.

Played once. Has great potential, and need to play it more. Great theme in it.
In the second play there was something missing, don't know what but it was just not working with us.

Wonderfully thematic. Not for players who demand action and simple rules. Rewards easygoing pace, long term planning and a role-player's attitude. Tons of moving parts but still very manageable mechanics. Unjustly under-appreciated on BGG. Snoozing off on downtime is unwise; paying attention to what's going on is crucial. Taking risks is necessary and so is coordination with other heroes - features, which often go unnoticed, or so it seems. Always highly enjoyable for the Sauron player. Not for whiners or the easily bored. You need to appreciate the story, the theme, and the rich setting of Middle-Earth to enjoy MEQ.

Great thematic game, but suffers from long play, lots of rules that need to be learned but play is intuitive. Tie breaker is very anti-climatic given how long a game session is.

I don't get to play this as often as I like because of the length, this is more of a gencon or convention game, but love love love this game.

솔직히 게임만 놓고 보자면 구매에 전혀 후회는 없다. 반지의 제왕을 다룬 게임들 중에서 가장 톨킨의 세계를 잘 구현했고, 게임성도 훌륭한 게임이니까. 그런데 문제는 해외구매한 녀석이라는데 있다. 이 녀석 때문에 배송료가 왕창 뛰어 오른 것 같은데, 구한 지 얼마 안있어 보드엠에 3000원 오른 가격으로 입고되었다. 그리고 최근에 다다에 누가 한글화까지 한 개봉 노플을 내가 산 가격보다 만 원 싸게 내놓더라.. 솔직히 이런 일 있으면 은근히 짜증난다. 그래서 해외구매는 자제하는 게 좋을 지도 모를 일이다. MMP의 가장 위험한 한 때 같이 아주 희소한 게임 아니면 말이다. 케이브 이블 같은 희귀게임도 장터에서 구했으니, 원..

Somehow the traveling seemed a bit pointless and it was quite difficult to overcome the monsters. Also, co-ops are really not my thing.

Own it for years now, but still didn't have both time and mood to try it.
Had to leave behind in Slovakia.

The missions are out of whack, so be sure to use some house rules to tweak them. The Sauron player seems to have more interesting things to do, he's playing a whole area control game on top of it all, whereas the Hero player(s) are mostly reacting, except perhaps when coming up with interesting ways to take down minions. There's a decent sense of narrative in the game, though, and the combat is fun; taking down Sauron's plans is at least playing against a human, rather than Arkham Horror's random challenges. The cards vary in power a lot, so there is a definite luck element here.

However despite the randomness, the game is a bit railroaded in terms of results; it seems to usually come to 1 point, or a tie-breaking battle (which can feel arbitrary, although accumulated upgrades and corruption do matter). 

Probably best with 4, since Sauron's given a little more flexibility which makes the game a little more varied and interesting. I'm guessing not that great replayability, but fun while it lasts.

Broken figures inside. Hopefully I will get fixed ones someday. I orderd from abroad and the FFG way of dealing this is that you contact the shop you ordered the game through. They (bookdepository) had no clue what FFG says and so I wait info from FFG to get me my fixed figs!

About the game: Works best with three because with four players the game tends to take a bit too long. I have playes 3 games and all have been won by Sauron. 

I like the theme a lot and this is a nice mix of Arkham Horror & Fury of the Dracula. But could be better, I don't know how, but it just feels like something is missing...

Excellently integrated combat/movement/deck system (somewhat borrowed from the Star Wars CCG) in a 1 vs many game where the many are TRULY up against it.  Some really nice components (as is standard from FFG nowadays) round off a decent game. Can run long though, be warned

The best exploration style space game.  You don't really know what you will get until you explore the system.  You have to balance between ship/colony building and research.  The computerized version was known as "Rearch for the Stars".

great game, although it probably would be better as a computer game. everything you do, is in secret from other players so it's a lot of paperwork. It's a good idea to start with a few planets already colonized, because the start of the game takes too long.

I believe this was my entrypoint to 'serious' games, and as such it has a special place in my collection. Trouble is - it's hard to find people willing to play a game that lasts more than 5 hours these days. But, I've come to realise that I really like pushing around the small tokens so typical for TAHGC games. The rules are a hard read, though.

You can play better 4x games on a palm pilot these days.  This game is very dated and very primitave compared to many computer 4x games, which in my opinion do a much better job.  This game was great in its day, when we didnt have the computer versions of 4x. Now it's not worth the effort.

Ahhhh yes, card 9... I have fond memories of a vast armada of Deathstars venturing forth from the shipyards at Deneb V. My friend Dave never had a chance...

Nowadays SC is a bit long in the tooth. This kind of game has been assumed by PC games like MOO and Space Empires.

RATING: 6
One of the grandfathers of space exploration games. It was amazing to play the cardboard predecessor to the computer game "Master of Orion" and notice all the similarities.

As a game of its own right, its not that awesome however, there are just better games that you can play if you want to spend half a day, like the Space Empires 4x.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Oldie but a goodie. Finally acquired one after all these years in a math trade. Happy with it. Lends itself well to tweaking and still plays well. Well worth looking into.
Rating revised down after acquiring Eclipse and Space Empires 4x.

RATING: N/A
The granddaddy of all 4X games. This is really an incredible game, and is actually far simpler than it first appears. The paper record-keeping is different, but no more laborious, than Space Empires 4X, and the game itself is far more interesting and coherent, without SE4X's terrible discontinuities of scale. 

I'm having a blast playing through a 4-player game solo. Would love to play this opposed someday, the bluffing aspect would be out of this world. The only drawback is that you have to trust that every player has complete mastery of the rules, as there is no way to catch inadvertent cheating.

AWESOME GAME - if you are a huge fan of Microsoft Excel, that is.  Actually, this is a cool game, but you have to not be scared by doing some tabulation of your population growth and industry points, which can get a little tedious.  Personally, I don't mind this at all, but I can imagine some would hate it.  I haven't tried any of the modern 4x space empire-ish games, so those have to be excluded from this comment, but I feel this game really captures the feel of a 4x computer space empire game in a board game format pretty well.  Really cool simple idea on using fleet marker for pseudo-hidden fleet movement.  I can't remember too much else other than my friend kicking my butt with Death Stars.

Biggest kick was discovering the new planets and developing the new technologies.  I actually played a copy of the 1969 version, when it was put out by Metagaming (though I own the newer AH version).  My friend and I fought only once, to see how the combat system worked; we were having too much fun just expanding our empires!

Definitely needs 4 players. 2 players have too much room to expand, no reason for conflict. 3 players-one gets squeezed between 2 others who can also divvy an empty sector between them. perhaps something like Wiz-War's 'autowarp' for a 3-player setup?

 Good mix of strategy/development and conflict.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Solid game of space empire building, playable in one sitting. Replayability factor high due to randomizing effect of card draw to determine type and size of newly explored star systems. Combat system very simple but effective. Only drawback was the record keeping for plotting movement, but it was manageable.

An innovative wargame in it's time, it has largely been overtaken by computer games that automate the record-keeping now.

RATING: 6
My rating is really more for the game this was than the game it is today. Nowadays you're probably better off playing one of the many computer game versions this classic design inspired, but back in 1976 this game was a mind expanding experience. Amazing that a thin (plastic? vinyl?) map and dull, typewritten counters could spark my imagination the way this game did. Terrific Kelly Freas cover on the original edition, too.

I played the Metagaming version of this game far too many times to count.  It was our favorite game from the time it came out until we graduated from HS and left town in 1979.  I think the game still holds up well.

The tech tree is well-designed and absolutely crucial to the course of the game.  This is a great explore, expand, research, and conquer game.  

I also enjoy Twilight Imperium v2.  I don't know that I can say that one is superior to the other.  They play differently.

As has been noted this is the game that inspired the computer games

RATING: 5
I think the problem with this game it that it's old. But it has some interesting idaes and remaking it could make a good game.

The major problem is that there is a lot of bookeeping and cross referencing since there is a lot of hidden information.  You need to write everything with pen and paper. That is what slow down the game. I would have not mind sacrificing hidden information for better playability.

There are interesting ideas like for example the battles. Even if it use a charts to resolve them, it prevent the weakest unit to destroy the strongest, the Death star, like it can be done in twilight imperium. So in this game, 1 death start can make a fleet unless other players also have death stars. You don't have to pad it with fighters to make sure it survives.

I think the goal of this game was to make it some sort of deduction game. Try to find where are the best planets are and control them. Try to find the enemy colonies of your player to capture them. That could be an interesting idea to exploit which could be fun if the resource management was less overwhelming.

So I would say play it at least once.

This is a classic that has inspired the whole 4X computer game genre. I believe that the praised computer game "Master of Orion" is a rip-off from this. It didn't age well though.

I really enjoy this game, despite the book-keeping.  It's a great exploration game, with fog-of-war, and tech development.  But the length of play, combined with the fact that you're barely getting going at turn 40 mean that this one hits the table very rarely.

Pretty decent game that has been superceded by games like Space Empires.  A bit too many map notes to make and too small a tech tree to keep it interesting.  Still, some good ideas and exploring the planets pretty fun, but the map was quite big with htree players and we didn't really start into conflict until close to turn 30, which was too long.  Funny that they actually called the Death Stars!  Not sure I will be playing again, but very glad to finally have gotten a chance to play.

This type of game is clearly better played on a computer.  A classic and influential design, this was the first 4X game design that I'm aware of.

I think that it would be unfair to rate this game now. When I had it many years ago, I spent many, many hours playing and enjoying it. However, from what I recall of the game, I can't imagine liking it today. A lot of bookkeeping, not a great deal of depth, and, honestly, superseded by far more engaging computer games.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.75
Epic space exploration title that is a good thematic idea, but several serious shortcomings - not the least of which is the "game length to fun" ratio.  I failed to find a theme-based reason for the population bonus; it's a sound mechanic, but makes absolutely no sense thematically, and I spent 5 hours swapping populations between planets.  Along those lines, the hidden information component worked with the theme, but with such a long game on such an expansive map, it just seemed like "multiplayer solitaire accounting."  For all the bookkeeping efforts done throughout the game, the victory conditions seemed overly simplified and incongruent to the game's depth, almost lazily tacked on to the ruleset.  I like the idea of this game more than its implementation.  Upon playing the game a second time, I enjoyed it more than the first and have modified my rating accoridngly.

Was an above average game in its day, but games as a whole have gotten a lot better since then.  I would much rather play Twilight Imperium 3 than this relic.

I like its theme. I like the building up of forces. But it takes a lot of work playing this one. It shows its age as a game. The bookkeeping required for this game is bothersome.

I think I would like this game better if I was an accountant -its a bit dry considering the theme and there is too much bookkeeping.  The game has some good concepts but the execution, not to mention the graphics, are dated.

I always enjoyed playing this game, which gives you lots of options and uses hidden moves and builds to good effect.  Perhaps I am unusual because none of my other opponents liked it!  The limited player interaction and book-keeping are problems.

I haven't played but the principle is similar to Twilight Imperium 3rd Edition.  Explore, collect resources, build technology trees.  The rules seem fairly simple and straightforward but the complaints about book keeping and the length of the game keep this one off the table.  After owning for some time I got rid of it during my cleaning of Christmas '07.

I sold this one ages ago.  It's multiplayer solitare for such a long period and the population management is not really very much fun.  Something like TI3 has more going for it than this.

Good game in its day. Everyone refined their basic math skills playing this. No one was ever sufficiently motivated to check anyone else's math for accuracy. Not much downtime but very little interaction (other than sweating out that unknown task force moving closer and closer all game).

Still, today, a very, very long game.

I love science fiction and games & thought I would enjoy this game more than I did.  I actually ended up selling my copy.  The trick that this game did most nicely was the decision of when to upgrade to higher technology.  But basically the game seemed to take too long and require too much work for the fun it gave.  I really wanted to like this but no go.

That said, this game is a classic in that it created the 4x (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate) game play model.

Stellar Conquest is a great space classic including empire building and technology features. The combat is rather limited but some have recommended using other games' combat systems for that part.

MOO I took its inspiration from Stellar Conquest, and it shows.  A good 2- or 4-player game, doesn't play quite as well with three since someone is sandwiched between the other two players.  A fair amount of record-keeping is involved, but only on production turns and there are only 10 production turns in a standard 40-turn game.  Winner is determined by score--3 points for each Terran planet and 1 point for each Sub-Terran planet in systems you control.  No points for population, ships, systems without Terran or Sub-Terran planets, although all of those things can help secure victory.

RATING: 3.5
Not much theme.  Predcessor to Space Empires.  No different races and ships are the same for each faction.  Play is extremely fiddly - population growth/bonus.  Purchasing can also be fiddly since tied directly with population.  Lots of exploring, not much fighting.  Could be kingmaking issues.  Components fair at best - colorful mounted board, cardboard chits, real chinsy cards.  Minimal artwork.  The record keeping sheet was not very useful.  Rulebook seemed OK.  Game length is very long for what this game has to offer.

Another great game from the pre-PC times.  Played this in high school a few times.  Never played it enough to realise that the mineral rich 40 world has to be part of your strategy.  Either you get and defend it, or you have to find who's got it and nail 'em.

We've done some blind two player games, fun but now-a-days the bookkeeping is too much.

I got suckered into the MOO3 debacle, although we only paid a penny after amazon dumped it with a rebate.

There's still a 4X void in our lives, I suppose it will eventually get filled.

Gave it to my brother, along with ALL of the extra tracks. Last time I saw him, I asked about it (thinking of borrowing it for a while), only to find out it had all got thrown out in a house move. He had no idea of the value of all those extra circuits... (sigh)

Sorry, Formula D (and De), SC is still the best Auto-Racing Boardgame. Luck is SO minimal, elevating it above it's dice-dependent siblings for me. Planned movement makes so much more sense. Alot of tracks available. Simple to teach, but nuances (turns, wear management, drafting, etc) make it a very tactical game. Love it.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not a bad game. Definately an influence on the people who designed Formula De, which is a better game. The difference is the cars have different characteristics and there is no randomness. Top speed, acceleration, deceleration, and "wear points" are fixed at the beginning of the game when you design your car. To exceed the turn speeds or perform another forbidden maneuver, you have to spend a wear point or two and possibly roll on a critical failure table. 

The basic game board has three tracks on it. Each lap takes about 30 minutes or so. Two laps seems to be about right for a race with the amount of wear points that you start with (4-6).

Always save a wear point for the last turn!

(> 10 plays) A really strategic racing game which can be played without depending on luck at all. It may look slightly outdated and Formule De is the fancier looking game, but when it comes to game play, Speed Circuit beats the pants off Formule De.

The original version of this remains the best.  It's been kept alive by loyal fans for many years but in my opinion, it's become a luck-fest where skill helps, but you're going to need to make that dice roll in the last curve to win, especially at the cons.

Crazy.  I have run the game at Prezcon, and I believe if I suggested the original rules, there would be a riot organized.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The 3M original is a great automotive racing simulation where the players' choices before (car attributes) and during the race (speed, position) are all that matters.  No dice or other silliness.  Is the lack of randomness to everyone's taste?  No.  But for the right people this game is a fun challenge where your choices and those of your opponents are all that matter.

It feels great to push your car to the limit, hitting one of the final curves too fast and wrecking it. 

A big part of the game is choosing your car's attributes.  Personally, I build cars like tanks, lots of durability.  

If you want your car to go 100 miles per hour, why wouldn't it?  If games where dice determine your speed drive you nuts - try this gem that has earned the title of "classic".

It's a fun simulation that always leaves me wanting to try one more race.

The best auto racing game if you can get eight or more players.

Requires players to make realistic driving decisions, and the dynamics feel like an actual auto race.  This is the king of racing games!  However, be aware that this is more racing simulation than game - in that it's extremely difficult to catch up if you fall behind or your car gets damaged.  Thus, players who are not in contention for the lead are forced to spend most of the game trailing behind with no hope of winning - and this can certainly be a big downer.  The right way to play this game is to run a series of races, to even things out.  But of course, that will probably require several gaming sessions.

Definately worth buying.  Out of Print but there are many copies on sale thru club, ebay, garage & estate sales.  I think that the random elements of racing enter this game with 4 or more players.  It is very important to follow the rule concerning speed selection.This rule causes the randomness to come into the game.  Ex. You choose 160 ((8) spaces) but two knuckle heads choose 100 and end up side by side 6 spaces in front of you,causing you to smash into one of them.

An interesting racing game.  I've had very little experience but I could feel the racetrack while playing.  The only problem was that it was very mathy, basically boiling down to calculating your moves without a lot of switching things around.  Cards could maybe help out a lot.

RATING: 10
In my opinion, this is the best car racing game published.  Avalon Hill made several improvements to the original version by 3M, most notably in providing for the ability to take a few chances along with some reward.  This is still a rarity in that it is a racing game largely devoid of chance. The more cars the better.  I know it is difficult to catch the leader, but that is true in the real sport. One of my favorite games.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fun, Low luck, just feels like a racing game should feel to me.  Great push your luck game.  Skill involved in picking to right car for the track, and tough decisions on just how much and when to "push it!"  So much better then Formula De!

You need to anticipate what the others will do and plan accordingly in this car racing game from the old Avalaon Hill company. Some tense decision making required, and the satisfaction of the chequered flag when it comes off! Can be hard to win from the back of the grid.

To me this is the ultimate racing game as there is very little luck invoved. You never have to roll a die if you plan your course correctly. I have had giant games I've game-mastered at cons and also played for cash prizes with friends. I have many of the additional tracks as well as one my friend made of the Cleveland Grand Prix. Played this game at least 100x but didn't keep track of them all because you throw out the Performance Chart when you're done.

My first racing board game.  Still like it despite my current involvement in two separate Formula De schedules.  I regret never obtaining the Speed Circuit expansion tracks when first published.  They weren't very pretty like the nice full-colored, and mounted Formula De tracks.  But, they are still very much in demand on the various auction websites. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Where Formula Dé is action and some randomness, Speed Circuit is calculation and some second-guessing, and probably a better simulation. For one thing, adding more cars makes it extremely difficult to catch up from the back. For this reason and others I'm not so sure it's a more satisfying game.

Finally played this puppy, and not with my AH copy, but with my more newly-aquired 3M long box copy.  Lot's of fun for me, but DO NOT PLAY THIS with the type of person who suffers analysis paralysis over simple things like, "Should I blow my nose or not?".... AP in a game like Tigris & Euphrates = understandable, expected and maybe necessary for the fullest gaming experience for all involved.  AP in a game like Speed Circuit = nearly ruin the experience of a classic game.

Great Great racing game, A classic. 

More detail... 

This plays a little similar to Formula D, except there is not rolling of dice each turn to see how far to move. You move based on the speed you set. You can only accelerate or decelerate as certain amount without taking wear on your car.  As usually in a racing game there are speed limits in turns and pushing over these will cost you wear as well. Eventually you will run out of wear and then bad things tend to happen. 

There are a few rules sets, the 3m Version being the simplest. Followed by the AH. There are some House rules that get used at the WBC and this is the most interesting rule set, but also the most complicated.

Fantastic game. The best board game about F1 racing. It's more a simulation than a game. The experience will only be complete if you play a season, because inevitably there are some races where you will be stuck far behind the leaders.

The 3M version did not use dice (I think this is the best), but Avalon Hill released theirs with dice. The dice is not mandatory, but the temptation to risk may ruin a driver's race. So, I think it's best the use of no dice at all.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Speed Circuit is one of my childhood games that still holds up today. I have since bought the 3M version and realized with or without chance either version is wonderful.

Here is a game you can teach (3M) in 10 minutes and play well.

Formula D is a fun game too but D stands for dice. A real game of chance mixed with some skill. SC is not about chance after chance it is more a game of skill. 

As I age, time becomes rarer and rarer especially for gaming groups. To spend hours on rules feels like I am at work versus an easy game to learn or teach. Plus the time it takes to run a race is minimal compared to most, especially Formula D. 

Everyone gets to design their own car so a more even game is hard to find.

Gameplay is much more important to me than game pieces or a visually stimulating board that offers no challenge. SC is a challenge while some critize the board or the cars visually, who cares? Not I. I'd much rather have fun with what comes in the box. My imagination still works fine.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The less capricious and more strategic ancestor of Formula D.  Better play will coincide with more success in this game than its aforementioned successor; the game's "diceiness" will create random outcomes only when players choose to push their luck.  In all, a better game than Formula D.

Wow, who knew that one of the best racing board games came out of the 70's? Granted the game looks dated, and you have to keep track of things on paper, but the gameplay is solid.

I bought this at the same time as USAC Auto Racing, so I could play with my nephew.  While we took to Auto Racing right away, and played countless enjoyable hours, Speed Circuit was a game I simply could not understand.

A heavier version of Formula D for gamers who want a little more control and a little less chance.  I really love this game.  The only problem I have with it is that you really need at least 8, probably 10 people to play this game correctly.  And unlike Formula D, you can't double-up on cars in order to make that happen.

But I love building your car, and I love the tense action running through the corners.  Also, the dice rolling for Chance and other aspects is more controlled but still adds an element of surprise and chance.  Very exciting.

The best race game ever and certainly my favorite. Allocate points for top speed, acceleration, deceleration, start speed, and wear. High strategy with very little randomness--just enough dice to keep it interesting and only if you want to use them. This game is great for large groups--5 to 6 drivers puts you in the sweet spot, but you can enjoy the game with fewer or more players.

Far more stressful than Formula D!, probably because there's so little luck--you're actually controlling the finish. Original components are very dated and weren't that great even back in the 70's--tiny cars, busy board. Custom tracks and cars make a big difference. Recommend homemade cards to plot speed vice the log sheets and using small metal lug nuts for wear. Lots of alternate rules out there, including some fairly modern updates for the WBC.

Great racing game.  This game is largely responsible for my interest in board games in general.  One of my favorite aspects of Speed Circuit is the ability to design your own car -- even as simple as it is, it adds a sense of creativity to the game.  The "build-your-own-unit" feature is something I look for in games (RPGs, Magic the Gathering, etc.) and this game was my first exposure to that mechanic.

RATING: 9.5
This is a great game. One of the best, and lots of excitement. The rules are simple, yet the play of the game is challenging. The Monza track is pure excitement, with high speeds, three lanes and only 1 sharp corner. Yet I frequently see games where the top 3 or 4 places are decided in that corner on the last lap. Monaco is just the opposite - tight and twisty, and with only one line and two lanes, it favors the front cars. Difficult to play it well. Watkins Glen is tighter still. Expect collisions on both these tracks! Add the expansion tracks for more fun!

Have had many, many hours of fun with this old one.  Nice mechanic for players to determine their moves leads to many mindgames and second guessing.

Unfortunately, many closely contested races are won or lost on players taking a 'Chance' at the very end of the race leading to a 50/50.  Another downside is that if you make a mistake at the beginning, chances are you're out of contention for the entire game.

This is the only racing game I own and I have always been pleased with its effort to not use dice and have the game be pure strategy.
That said, the strategy can not always be a game changer. Often one great move by an opponent cannot be overcome, and you will find yourself trailing the entire game. But maybe that's the case with formula one, too.

I own the 3M version.  I enjoyed this so much as a teenager that I made 5 additional tracks (Daytona - speedway and 24 hrs infield ext, Kyalami, Silverstone, Zandervoort, and Mosport Park in Canada) and would replay with my favorite F1 drivers from the 60s and 70s (Jim Clark, Graham Hill, Jackie Stewart, Mario Andretti).  A really fun game as I recall.

A bit dated; this game came out in the early 70s when F1 popularity was on the rise in the USA, and the designers were obviously hoping to make some money off of the craze. A pretty good job overall, not dice dependent like Formula D and the like, but a little more work to play. Works better with more cars.

Perhaps this game is a little too mathy for some, but I really like it.  It moves along at a brisk pace and keeps folks pushing to try to get the edge up.  I can see how people might find this too systematic, but I like the way that everything works together.  I would suggest playing the AH version with the WBC rules so that you have some more control to cut the chaos, but a little bit more luck to cut the number crunching.

Definately print out the speed cards here at the geek they aid the game considerably.

Played as kid in 80's. Rediscovered last year via PBEM. With all the different tracks available and a full field (typically 12), this game is different and challenging every time.

1 play, 4er, simple side (loop) race course.

Not bad, but I need to try it on the harder track -- 2 loops on this simple track just wasn't all that interesting (dice roll modifiers turned out to be mostly unused). So many rulesets to choose from, too! Need to try them all, I suppose!

RATING: 8
A very basic, simple system where you can even create your own cars, yet fun to play.  Much less luck-driven than Formula De, but it can be a little dry, so it depends what you're in the mood for, as they're both good games.

For an older game, surprisingly easy to learn and play.  Movement of the cars is NOT based on die rolls.  It is completely up to the player, which makes for much strategy and tension in the game.  The components are of good quality - plastic cars and mounted board.  Game length is fairly short.

One of my old favorites.  I can remember debating at length the merits of the 80/60/40/140/4 car vs. the 60/60/40/160/4 vs. the 40/60/40/180/4, etc.  Great game to play with at least 4 (or 3 with 2 cars each) on the original 3 tracks.  Several of the expansion tracks were unbalanced though.

Keep in mind...I don't play with just the stock rules. The 'spinout if you hit someone from behind' rule always bothered me.  Instead, I picked up a set of advanced rules at GenCon back in 1990. The author had been hoping to publish it...but I don't think that ever happened sadly.  It's too bad. The advanced rules are awesome.

Simple yet realistic racing game.  Very little luck involved.  It is now 25-30+ years old so its components pale in comparison to Formula De.  Great game just not quite as much fun as Formula De although it is a more accurate simulation of F1 racing.

Seems like this is the best racing game out there if played with suitably modified modern rules. This feels like real racing, compared to most racing games that feel like yahtzee. Tempo also feels like it could be upheld easily.
PnP version based on sarracenias modular hextrack made. Looking for original version.

Two plays under my belt, and I'm content with never touching this one again. This is a racing game that really doesn't have much sizzle. There's decisions, but most of the decisions are in the form of counting how many spaces you would like to go. Other cars on the track won't be enough. The full complement of six players helps significantly. The game does have the appeal of simplicity, simpler even than [gameid=173]. The art has also not aged well, and the cars, though pewter, are not all that attractive.

This copy is in pretty good condition overall and it has much of the chart pad left.  However, it is missing one of the cars and there is a slight pucker rip on one of the board folds.  The box has just a little bit of wear and a couple whitened corners, but is solid and looks good.

This game is a lot of fun.  It's been a long time since I've played it, so my memory might be flawed on the details.  But I like how it handles determining speed and flow through the turns.

I've GOT to get this on the table soon....

NOTE:  Years after I made the above comments, I finally played it again.  It turns out that my memory was spot-on.  It is a lot of fun, and I like how the game's simple rules handle the speed and corners, etc.

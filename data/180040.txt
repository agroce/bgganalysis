LIKE: Great artwork, easy enough to learn. Some mild strategy and card combos that keep you looking for what's good. Fun to see the new cards coming out. I also enjoyed the tug of war for gold. It added a good zero-sum point element that added some depth.

DISLIKE: Light. This game seems to be about the extra point cards, which are randomly seeded. Not much more depth beyond that and the gold. Some negative "take that" cards, but mild.

OVERALL: It's good. I like it for what it is, a fantasy themed version of San Juan. I feel San Juan's cards have more interesting variance than this game, but the extra addition here of the tug of war of gold is nice.

I want to see how well it works with non-gamers.

Just played a "test"game (pnp-version) solo for 3P. Quite a nice game with a main-mechanic very similar to games like San Juan: The active player takes an action, all others may follow at higher costs. After that, the next player will become the active player and take an action; that may be the same as the previous player did; that's the main difference between San Juan and VoV. Good enough to back, so I did

Similar to Race for the Galaxy in that the winner is the player with the most VP which gets scored at the end of the round when a player first gets 10 or 12 cards in his village. Main difference is that rather than each player picking an action each round as in RFTG, only the active player picks an action and the other players can choose to follow (same action but not as effective or more costly) or do nothing, then the next player becomes the active player. Games comes with a solo option out of the box where you try to maximise VP before the deck runs out. Nice little game.

I want to play this more before I give it much more of a review.  I have only played it once and it was a pleasantly light action-selection style game.  It didn't feel like it was offering anything terribly new, but what it did, it did well with some very nice art.  It is a very nice game that gives a satisfying experience in a nice and small box.  If you like lighter Euro-style games, it is a good option.  You get to build a little engine, use it a couple times, and before things get too complicated, the game is over.  Its pacing felt pretty good, if just a tad short.  But if it is an issue, you can easily just extend the game by house-ruling the game to end at a larger tableau than the rules state.

A very competent tableau-building card game that incorporates dual-use cards. There is a lot of similarity here to Race for the Galaxy where one person takes an action and others can follow in a less efficient way. However, this doesn't have the same learning curve that RftG has which is good. It won't blow anyone away as it doesn't bring anything new to the table but it works. A great option to bring out for 3-5 players when you want to play something on the lighter side.

2nd game in this Valeria where they took the core concepts from a different game, and tried to create a new experience with them.  So far they are 0 for 2 in creating a better game than the original.  This takes the mechanisms from San Juan, and adds some layers, but the discard layer is awful, and just slows the game down.  I like the recruit element they added on, but its still not enough to make this even close to as interesting as San Juan.  I don't feel like this publisher play tests their games well enough, and their games just haven't felt "done" yet.  Played at 4 players, but I think it would be better at 3 players for sure as the discard / drawing element in this game can get a bit slow.

It is a very nice engine building game that is reminiscent of San Juan. Things I like: Much of the card draw randomness is mitigated by having so many available draw piles, each player can customize their end game scoring, players get special powers that lead to bigger and bigger actions, players can utilize each other's resources, and an internal economy of gold that creates interesting dynamics.

Overall I was surprised by how much I liked the game. Nothing ground breaking, but some unique twists on a tried and true style of game.

What a perfect addition to the Valeria world!  The more I play this the more I am rewarded with a better score... hallmark of a great game! Community role selection is a great mechanism. Couple that with the "deals" mechanism from Imperial Settlers and a card-based sub-1-hour civilization building game that plays up to 5 people!  I'm very happy with this purchase.

Was hoping it would play like fantasy San Juan, and it does play like fantasy San Juan.  The building aspect plays similar to San Juan except that you don't use cards, you use resources and gold on your castle so there is a nice engine building aspect to the game.  The extras added in during the campaign do little to really complicate the game and make it more interesting so I will gladly play with them.  Solo mode is nice with a countdown from the building deck, trying to maximize the points you have available.  Love this game.

Plays a little like Race for the Galaxy with the resource gathering of 7 wonders. Not crunchy enough to hit the table on a regular basis. Best for a lazy after-work evening when the brain is tired.

My rating is based off of a single play so it is possible that this could change. This game reminds me a lot of Race For the Galaxy but in a more simplified package. You're building up a Tableau and as the game goes on you have a lot more that you'll do on your turn. My concern is that the strategy might not be super deep. I plan to try this at different player counts to see how it feels.

I've now played this with 2 players and 4 players and I think I might like it with more players, but I still have concerns regarding the strategy. In both games I've played, the person to win is the person with more on their tableau which means if someone falls behind, I don't see a great way for that player to catch up.

I played this a couple of times with my girlfriend and I think that it might be better with more people but as a two player game it seemed to drag.  Remembering all of the on going special powers and we kept forgetting who turn it was because I would "follow" her action per the rules but then would get all these bonuses for my special buildings and characters and I or her would get some AP and then after we finally selected cards we would be like "Okay, now whose turn is it??"  I know that I need to play this with higher player counts and just need to limit AP.  I hate to criticize a game for my AP but it really can be a little tedious to remember all your special powers by the end of game.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ Nice tableau-builder card game which feel like a mix of San Juan (gameplay with the variable phase order, 1st player choosing the action and others following the action), Splendor (in that you have to have certain buildings done to recruit adventurers), 7 Wonders (for the ressources production system, though the gold twist is new and fresh), Fairy Tale (as some of the scoring is based on set collection of icon of building types/Adventurers) and Ticket to Ride/Lost Cities (because you draw from 5 open cards, or blind from the deck, and you discard on top of one of the 5 drawing stacks, so these cards can still be drawn by other players).
++ The component quality is great: Cards are thick, token are done right, and the box feel sturdy.
++ Great game insert which hold everything in an orderly fashion (and that allows for sleeved cards).
++ Fun, fast to set-up and fast to play card game, all that in a small portable box (even though the deluxe box is less portable than the standard version).


:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- Since it borrows aspect of other well known games that we own (and love!), this one doesn't stand out much from these other games.
-- The Events are not really worth it: It lengthen the setup time and tear down time, just to add more randomness.
-- In a 2-players game, the Adventurer doesn't cycle enough so we see very few of them.
-- Often, the Adventurers are not worth the effort to Recruit, as you loose one point (or 2, from the spent gold coins) to get just a few points in general. IMO, Adventurers should have all very powerful abilities, generally about end of game scoring to amplify the progression of the engine-building part of the game (so some of the scoring abilities of some building should have been on Adventurers cards instead).

Game feels fun and balanced. Ends just when out should: as soon as the leader has a distinct advantage. Those who are out to build the best engine (instead of focusing on the race to 12 VP) will find the game ending sooner than they would like, as 11-12 VP are required for a hyper-efficient engine. They can still win, but will likely be more excited by what their engine was about to do than about the victory.

Build a village and recruit people to it all in a race to 12 cards. On your turn you take 1 of 5 actions, not taking the 1 last chosen, and then everyone else has the option to follow at either a slightly higher cost or less beneficial to you. I always enjoy this in a game because it keeps people involved every turn and really keeps the game moving along quickly. I played with 2 and it seemed a bit like we were just alternating the same actions towards the end either build or recruit. One downside is the coins for gold are so incredibly small, they easily could have been a little bigger. Overall a good game, just not wowed by it.

VoV is a worthy successor to Valeria: Card Kingdoms and easily one of my top travel games. Which is saying something since it's not small and portable like Star Realms. And yet I continually toss it into my bag when I'm meeting gaming buddies for dinner.

VoV takes the resource gathering mechanic from VCK and replaces the dice with cards that come in two variants: Buildings and Adventurers. Building cards are dual-purpose, something that I always have a soft spot for because each decision you make carries a consequence. Do I convert this building into a resource so I can buy better buildings or do I build it in order to recruit Adventurers? The dual-purpose mechanic is a core concept to the game one one that is both seamless and tense. 

That tension is further heightened by the limited pool of gold (number depends on player count) and the ability to not only pay other players for use of their resource, but the option to "block" options when you discard. If I know another  player wants a high-value building, I can easily place my discard on top of it, forcing them to either pass on it or buy their way through my discard to the card they want. 

As with VCK, VoV offers the Lead-Follow mechanic which means there's literally no down time for any player. This has slowly become one of our favorite mechanics since it keeps all players engaged from the first hand to the last. Even when playing with someone who suffers high AP, VoV suffers little to no breaks in the action. 

Also like with VCK, VoV starts slow and ramps up to a frantic sprint at the end. And the tipping point always catches you off guard. One moment you're deciding whether to build or recruit, the next you're in a race to get a high-value adventurer or blow the few remaining gold for one last building. Combined with some excellent potential synergy between card types, VoV is as wide as it is deep. 

Overall, we knew VoV was going to appeal, but underestimated just how much it would succeed. While there are certainly elements that smell similar to its predecessor, VCK, VoV streamlines the table-space and game mechanics, distilling a huge footprint into an efficient, fast-paced race to the finish. Between the fast play, rock solid mechanics, and the every delightful artwork by industry icon The Zico, Villages of Valeria is easily one of our top gaming picks in recent memory and a worthy successor to the wildly popular Valeria: Card Kingdoms.

A house favorite as the game is free of back-stabbing and solely focused on village development.  We have been playing the card game for close to four months and no two games have been the same!  

The closest you can possibly come to performing a dirty trick on an opposition is to BLOCK one of their resources by spending one of your gold coins on their card.  This will prevent them from using their resource until it's their turn, at which point, they get to keep your gold coin - thanks!

There always seems to be a "Killer Card" that everybody wants, but rarely does it give the same advantage.  Basically, the entire village influences the 'buff' card factor.  It's all about having the right balance across your village.

I am not a fan of the core way the game plays, which is a shame because I normally love card drafting and it has a great mechanic where players all have an action during each players turn. This mechanic cuts down the player downtime between turns to almost zero, how cool is that? Personally I'd rate the game a 5, take it or leave it. But to be fair, placing aside my personal tastes, it gets a 6.5.

All the ingredients are here for a good game, but the stew needs way more spice. The management of resources is not terribly stimulating and the rather dull card effects do little to pull you in. The game 'may' be better with more players, but at two or one, it suffered.

PnP #48

[b]Rating based on - 10+ plays, 2 player[/b]
Been enjoying this one very much since February this year. A delicious combination of card drafting - drafting buildings, resources, and adventurers, and hand management in deciding how to use your multiuse cards - whether for resources or as buildings, which cards to discard, and on what pools to discard them, which adventurers to recruit given the combination of cards in hand, cards on the table and the resources/buildings/adventurers available. Even though it's a card game, you don't feel restricted by the cards like you have a 'poor' hand but that you always do something interesting on your turn.

Stunning artwork, love the fact that Daily Magic Games releases their games as PnP and it's easy enough to make with just cards and a few coins needed, game plays smoothly and quickly, the rules were clear from the get go and we only needed the Special Powers table for reference, the drafting works great with 2, different strategies possible to be able to pull out a win, and we love the tough decisions about whether to use a card for resources/buildings, which adventurers to recruit based on the cards that come out, what bonuses to strive for etc. SO much to think about, yet SO much fun!!!

Like both the Valeria games I have played, and they each are different enough to enjoy & own.
     There are 3 Monastery cards in the deck.  In every game I have played (5 so far), the player who builds this card early, wins.  I have considered removing this card from play because it is a game breaker by removing the strategy of the game, and bringing it down to a game of luck--who gets the card first.  
     If I don't remove this card I rate the game a 6.  If I remove the card, it's a 7.3 for me.

Eléggé hajaz a glory to rome-ra, ami nem baj, mert így lehet igazán komoly játékot csinálni egy pakli kártyából. Viszont pont annyira más, hogy azért teljesen újnak hasson. Jó a szerepválasztás, jók az épületek, képességek, hősök benne. A balansz is egész jónak tűnt. Viszont kicsit sok a végiggondolhatatlan gondolkodni való. Kicsit olyan órával játszós játék, mert elvileg végig tudod gondolni a lehetőségeket, de gyakorlatban erre extrém sok idő kéne, így viszont nekem kicsit frusztráló elengedni a dolgokat, hogy közben tudom, hogy csak még egy kis idő kéne. :)

Ładne grafiki, sporo kart plus rozszerzenia z wydarzeniami tworzą ciekawy tytuł. Spodziewam się, że wśród doświadczonych graczy może się zamknąć nawet w 20 minutach. Mechanika deckbuildingu wraz z rolami - podobnie jak w Glory to Rome, można wybrać, czy powtarza się akcję przeciwnika na gorszych warunkach, czy pasuje. Wszystko ładnie się ze sobą zazębia, a sama gra nie jest skomplikowana, ale też nie prostacka.

It's sort of like a "cleaned up" version of Race for the Galaxy. I still think RftG is better because it has more depth, but this plays quick, has clear iconography and looks great!

The coin mechanic is what really makes this game shine. The follow opportunities and discard mechanic adds some well thought out interactions and choices, but the most interesting interaction is with coins. By not using all of your resources on your turn, you allow for opportunities for your opponent to use those resources, but at the permanent cost of giving your opponent a coin. Coins are important as they are both worth victory points and allows you to build more resource-requiring buildings, so the choice is not made lightly. This can lead to interesting interactions where you purposefully don't use all of your resources in an attempt to lure other players to give you their coin.

Similar to San Juan, this game is good in its own right, but suffers from a but of slowness, and some very overpowered cards it seems in the BUILD bonus buildings.  I love that they took the economy system in games like 7 wonders, but I hate how they reward hoarding.  Passing money through the economy to other players should be more rewarding the hoarding.  in 7 Wonders, $3 = 1VP in this $1 = 1VP so people like to just hold on to money.

Engine-building card game that feels like a clean and light descendant of Glory to Rome, with some concepts also ported from 7 Wonders. I thought it all fit together quite well, generating tension and interesting decisions. The game appears to be very tightly and thoughtfully developed, which is impressive for a crowdfunded game from a new publisher.

Would never play it again with 4 people, as it just takes too long then, but I will try it as a 2 player game, though.

The game itself is ok, nothing new or interesting, but solid. However, it ends too fast for an engine builder. There are so many cards you would like to use, but while you build up your engine, the game just ends...

Fun engine-building game that I enjoy more than something streamlined like Splendor. The art is stellar, but the theme still feels shallow as I don't see anything coming out of the mechanics of the individual cards. Not bad as an entry-level engine builder, but it's simply not good enough to recommend with that tagline. It's too hard to teach to be a quick pick-up-and-play option while being vastly inferior to something like Race for the Galaxy (which is only slightly heavier in weight).

Great little card game. It has a role selection mechanism where the active player chooses and action and takes a bonus while every other player gets to follow that action (albeit without the bonus). Although a similar action selection mechanism to Race for the Galaxy or San Juan, this game adds a bit of resource management with having to build resource production spots in your tableau in order to construct buildings in your tableau. I've enjoyed this even at the higher player counts and it usually clocks in at just over an hour, depending on the number of players.

Kickstarter version of the game. Gameplay goes super fast with 2 player (once you both know what you are doing). The game itself is a rather straight forward card game....get a card, use it to either get resources or build it for VP. Use gold to produce (gold which you only lose if you buy and "adventurer"). Hire "adventurers" that are basically other types of items that have building requirements that get you VP.

Nice little game to crack open after playing an epic game of Star Ware Rebellion.

This has an interesting take on the original Valeria dice rolling mechanism, whilst still sticking to its roots in so far as one player 'leads' the turn, and the others have the option to 'follow' their actions (but at a higher cost). I also like the fact that you can utilise other player's resources, but are effectively giving them a Gold counter for the privilege. Very clever, and fun. I certainly enjoyed it.

Quick little San Juan rip off. It's fun and well designed but really feels like it could use the Duke system utilized by its older brother Valeria Card Kingdoms. It just really seems to lack direction and feel like a minor points race game.

A stand-alone game in the Valeria series, in this game you are each working to build up a village. You start out with a castle and the ability to generate two resources, one wild and one that you choose at the beginning of the game. During your turn you will choose between Harvesting (drawin cards), Developing (giving yourself the ability to generate another specific resource), Building (putting down buildings for points and abilities), Recruiting (recruiting Villagers to come to your Village for points and abilities) and Taxing (gaining Gold and cards).

The main player chooses one of the actions, takes it in full, and other players may choose to follow and take a lesser/more expensive version of that action. Once a player manages to reach a given number of buildings and villagers, the game ends and whoever has earned the most points wins.

This is a very enjoyable continuation of the Valeria series. Ultimately I find myself enjoying Valeria: Card Kingdoms more, this game is different enough to earn its own spot in my collection. I look forward to trying out the added mini-expansions added in this version and all in all I am very happy with having backed this game.

Not the best Valeria but a descent and easy to teach engine builder. I especially like the follow me mechanic. Fits into a light gaming night and the art is, as always with Valeria, colorful and excellent. The wooded pieces could have been done better and the insert for the KS edition does not fit sleeved cards like the publishers stated it would. Overall, I'm happy I own it.

Kickstarted because the reviews looked good and I like San Juan. Played with the family at Christmas. Got a bit confused about how the expansions interact with the main game rules. But we really enjoyed our initial playthrough and I think I can get this to the table again. It seems surprisingly deep for just a few cards.

Nice game. Have only played it a handful of times, all 4 player, but it's a good game that works well.  I really like the art - I'm a fan of The Miko.  

I know the mechanics aren't new and innovative, but they all work together nicely:  the lead & follow actions, paying to use other players' resources, etc.

I also like that it is more than a filler game, yet comes in a compact package.

Villages of Valeria is a game of the Puerto Rico tradition, where you collect cards by choosing actions that benefit you the most and your opponents the least. It's simple and streamlined but does not manage the lack of control due to the fact that the majority of your actions are chosen by other players.

Yeah! Another great game in the Valeria franchise. Really like the deep strategy behind all the options. Still it´s somewhat luck driven/depends on what your opponents do.

Quality is above average. Art is way above average. It sticks to the Valeria style.

RATING: 6
Villages of Valeria takes parts of 51st State, San Juan, and Lost Cities and puts them together in a nice package.  I say nice because, while the gameplay was fun, there was nothing that made me stop and go "wow."  To be fair, I played only the basic game without the additional items that came with my KS, so this score may change.  But, for now, it feels like a nice imitation that does not do enough to make me forget about the games it borrows from.

Interesting concept - building a town to attract heros.  In parctice the balance of power between cards makes for too many useless/throw-away cards.  You could look at this as strategic management of draw piles, but that part isn't much fun.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]This is the second Valeria game I've played and I much prefer it to Quests of Valeria. So far the designers of the Valeria games have re-implemented the ideas and mechanisms in other popular games while containing them in one consistent universe. Quests plays like a card game version of Lords of Waterdeep, Card Kingdoms plays similar to Machi Koro and Villages is a tableau builder in the vein of San Juan/RftG. Similar to San Juan/RftG, in Villages the first player chooses a role and the other players can follow by taking a lesser version of the role selected. 

Villages of Valeria is all buidling combos based on the adventurers and buildings you have in play. There is also a set collection element as you try and collect up to four different different types of locations, worker, soldier, shadow, holy, which then allow you to hire different adventurers. Typically adventurers may give you an instant bonus and some way to score end game VP.

The rules are easy to pick up, the artwork is by far the highlight of the game and will definitely be a lot more appealing to kids than a game like San Juan. In fact I think Villages is a perfect family game and a great intro into tableau building games. 

There are a few negatives I have with the Villages, but none of them are deal breakers. First there isn't a lot of variety among the cards, especially the buildings and directly tied in to that is the bonuses are standard fare which makes Villages feel kind of blah. What saves the game for me is the artwork, which pulls you into the game, and how quickly it plays. My son and I can play a game in 20 minutes which is perfect, any longer and the game would start to lose it's luster.

In saying all this, I am still having fun playing Villages and it'll be sticking around for a while since my son really likes it. I'm really interested to see how this holds up to repeated play and whether or not it'll be in our collection a year from now. I would definitely recommend it for families looking to get a solid, introductory tableau building game.[/i]

5 Plays - Great little game. Each turn the active player takes a turn, with other players being able to follow. Players can only amass 10-12 cards in their village so must choose carefully about what they will construct to maximise on points. This doesn't do anything new, but it is a great, compact medium light, game.

Fun game which seemed to have a little from Glory to Rome, Race for the Galaxy, and the resource building from 7 Wonders.  It was quick, had some combos, and minor interactions.

I wish there were more interactions and better to follow card special abilities.  The scores seemed tight at the game end, where I'd rather see a bigger spread of points.

After Quests of Valeria, this is the second game I play in the series. I had exact the same feeling after Quests of Valeria: it works, I wouldn't mind playing it, but I don't understand the hype about this game as there is nothing really new in this game.

I also think that less is better for this game, with 4 it takes too much downtime.

San Juan in a fantasy setting, or a reduced-fat Race for the Galaxy, VoV probably sits between those two for me. It was felt by the group that the Character cards were underpowered and undervalued: returning a Gold to the supply - or, worse, two - simply was not worth the reward. Only four were picked up; three, though, by the winner. Enjoyable enough, if obviously derivative.

This game was great. I'm really happy with this resource management and engine building game. Quick and fun, with great player interaction. I love the ability to follow actions with a weaker version of them. The art is wonderful as the icing on the cake. I had to come back to add to this comment. The more I play this game, the more I like it. I highly recommend adding the expansion card packs (very inexpensive) which can add cards and variety to the base game to increase replayability even if you don't add in the extra modules. This is one of the best small box games around. Get it, play it, enjoy it!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Got this one from Kickstarter. The box is nicely presented and the cards are quite nice stock. Artwork is good and fun throughout. There are foam inserts which allow everything to be stored very well and safely, but also allow the space for cards from any future expansion to be stored too. I really like when I can store expansions in the original box!

The game itself is pretty simple to play. At it's heart, it's a resource gathering/management game. You get resources, you use them to add buildings to your village, then those buildings can entice adventurers. The interesting twist is that when you take an action - other players get to take the same action after your turn (though they either pay more for it, or get a lesser benefit). This introduces the twist in the game which differentiates it from other resource gathering games.

I've only played it 2 player - I think some of the mechanics will really shine when playing 3-4 players. From what I've seen, the game is pretty solid with tangible benefits coming from building each new building. 

I have a couple of complaints. Some of the cards do not properly explain what they do. When interpreting, they either have a completely OP effect - or an amazingly underwhelming one. An FAQ of each card's operation is definitely needed. Another complaint is that adventurers seem somewhat underpowered or are too expensive. Gold is an important resource, and the likelyhood of not getting it back after buying an adventurer can really limit your options later! So balance is not that good at times, I feel.

Still, overall I think this is a solid and fun game. It's easy to play, but has too much strategy to be considered "filler", but it's too quick and not deep enough for me to consider it to be a "strategy game" either. This game will sit happily somewhere in between and will definitely see play!

[Daily Magic Games 2016 deluxe edition] {Valeria; action-drafting; optimal 4p} Players tries to be the most successful Duke in the villages by amassing buildings and adventures.

Players may follow the selected action of the active player with lesser privileges.  The rule is easy to understand.  Each turn, players to select one of the 5 available actions.  Player interaction is good in the sense of purchasing resources, and manipulating the draw piles.

The card illustration is stunning.  I like it.  I love the castle meeples.

tl;dr: decent

I like it when cards games in small boxes have some depth to them. Especially if cards can be used in different ways. This game fits that description.
You have cards that can be built as buildings. Or added to a structure to function as a resource generator. Or added to monuments to be a resource. Or discarded to pay for certain actions. That's always good in my book.
Underneath it is a game that has some engine building and resource management and a few ways to score VPs.
It all fits together quite nicely. Nothing is groundbreaking or spectacular, but it is quite pleasant and moves fast.

No substantial reason for dropping the rating other than that we continue to find games we enjoy more than this in a similar category.  The action selection process seems to always end up confusing, especially for newer players, while Card Kingdoms runs much smoother overall.

Original:
We enjoy this game, but prefer Valeria: Card Kingdoms if choosing between the two.  New players had a much harder time grasping this game, and with some cards hidden in their hand it's hard to coach them without them revealing their secrets.  I also find it surprising that the box is so inferior to V:CK, which had foam inserts and card dividers while this just has cards tossed in a stack!

There are a lot of good things in this small box, though.  The game has more player interaction than most other deck builder/card drafting games we've played.  Everyone has the option to "follow" the active players turn, which means you're going to be paying closer attention to what each player is doing.  (This reminds me a bit of Roll for the Galaxy, where you're secretly hoping someone else picks a certain action.)  There's also player interaction in the form of buying resources from other people if you're desperate enough to give them your gold.

It's more strategic than I expected.  You can spend a lot of time debating which cards to develop as resources and which to build.  You'll quickly learn that some actions are generally not worth following because of the added cost, while other actions are ones you'll virtually always follow.  This means you'll pick certain actions on your own turn because that's the only ideal time to do them.  (Developing - I'm looking at you.)

As already said, I find this a bit more complex (in some ways) than Valeria: Card Kingdoms but there's no mistaking that they're related games.  The good thing is that both games use the same symbols so if you get familiar with one game, the other game won't feel too new.  On the other hand, if you play both very often it can be easier for some players to confuse the two games - because the cards and icons are so similar!

A San Juan knockoff. So much pretty, though. What it does it does well, but it offers absolutely nothing it hasn't been done (several times) before.

Nice and simple card game. There are combos already visible from the first play, but probably this would work better once players are more familiar with the cards.

I'm going to give it a solid 7.5. Much easier to teach than Race for the Galaxy, much more fun than San Juan. The complexity is good for what it is but I won't drop everything to play this on a game night. Solid for a game night starter or to teach new players. All in all I'm happy with the purchase. Good work!

UPDATE: on further plays I've reduced the rating a bit. Game seems more repetitive than RftG. Still a very fun game.

I played the PNP version and really liked it. I backed it on Kickstarter. Can't wait to get the Kickstarter version.

This is an okay game. I like the art and the compact box, and I appreciate that it fits sleeved cards. It just seems like a lighter version of games that already do what it does, but better. For example, it's similar to Imperial Settlers, but much more simple. Nice as a gateway or stepping stone to a more complex game, but not something I'd choose over a meatier option otherwise.

Fantasy themed village building card game variant of Card Kingdoms. Only, no monsters and no dice. I like it's heavy focus on the central tableau for card buying and discarding with a Gin Rummy feel.  You hate to see your card taken or buried and of course not wanting to give away something they can use. Lots of tradeoff decisions is good and I always like multi-use cards that can be used in development to activate for building resources. The follow action keeps all players engaged between turns.

A tableau building game for 2-5 players. Each turn, the lead player selects and action, then all other players may use a weaker form of that action. Players compete to buy buildings and recruit adventurers to be the best village.

Tetszett, szuper kis tablóépítés, kompakt méretben. Egy picit Dicsőség Rómának, a "követés" jól működik itt is, elő lehet készíteni a kombókat. Ehhez persze tapasztalat kell és a kártyák kiismerése, de jól tanulható a játék véleményem szerint, valamint az ikonozás is segít ebben. Jól gyúrták össze, mehet még majd a játék vele.

Második játékra már össze is állt, jöttek a lapok is, így igazán élvezetes csata ment. Játszatja magát, már mehetne is a következő menet.

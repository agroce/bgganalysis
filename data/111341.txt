5 plays / 3,4,5 players

LIKE: A brain burner. Interesting mix of strategies with the gods, great game arc. This game shows just how intricate great games can be. Not a long game, but individual turns can be long. Unique theme.

DISLIKE: Upgrading towers can get very fiddly and time consuming. Dry theme. Can be unforgiving if a player should fall behind. Difficult to teach beginner gamers. Something as simple as turn order can be the deciding factor at the end. Maybe not so good with 5 players(?).

OVERALL: This is a game that requires multiple plays to see the depth, which is quite deep. The game really has a nice combo between craftman placement and connecting resources and how they are used at the end game. It is hard to see all the connections first time through. Then once you think you know it, someone figures out a new strategy with one of the gods.

Surprisingly short, only a handful of turns but the game is just so tight. The many little interactions and the limited resources available means you've got to plan for when you're going to strike, while also keeping down the other players. Great, great game.

Had my first game on 13th-Mar-2017 and it's definitely intriguing. Too many way of strategy and very unique bidding method to get the most advantage starting sequence of every round. The more god/specialist power you get to aid you inside the game, the more thing you have to do to win the game, which is really balance!

Another well-designed game that is fairly fun...but way too complicated for me to play on a regular (or infrequent!) basis.  I like the engine-building and the variable length, based on chosen abilities.  Seems like there's lots of different ways to play it.

Very elegant game, with a very limited set of rules, but huge depth.

The ability for players to modify during play their winning conditions is very innovative. The importance of turn order auction in the end-game rubs some players wrong.

The modular board, emerging topography and variable set of gods in play ensure a huge replayability.

The meta in this game has a profound impact on game play. First plays will be quick, but last longer as players become more experienced. Can be a brain-burning exercise, with nice tricks and unexpected moves. Love it!

RATING: 8
Can't say much about the theme. It could be any culture for that matter. Besides the cards, the flavour of Africa is not felt on board.

As for the game play, it's really very refreshing and challenging to play. The components are OK, the cattles are great, but felt the currency notion placed on them, thematic it may be, but just did not feel right.

The map is butt ugly BUT it gives me a very nostalgic feeling of yesteryear's quality, where AH prints their map functionally, but lacks the beauty of today's artistic colorings.

The game plays very well and its a manipulation of a build-engine that generates VPs for your final win. The extension of 'required VPs', pushes those that depend on 'power' to win that much harder.

The interaction between players might seem low, but the need for resources on board forces much interaction between players.

Fist play will be difficult, but subsequent plays will greatly improve your chances of winning with the right combination of God, specialist and action.

A very solid design that is worth the gaming time, anytime.

RATING: 8
This is only the second Splotter game I have played.  Indonesia is the other, and I have Antiquity on deck.  Can't quite make up my mind about it.  As a rule I don't particularly care for spacial Euros, but this is very intricate game that I think will reveal itself fully only via multiple plays.  In our first game, Philip conned us into raising prices prematurely.  In hindsight, this basically gave him the game.  The decisions are excruciating, and even with just one action a turn, I felt like I was making mistake after mistake in the end game, after what I thought was a very good start.  Oh well .....  It is by miles the most expensive of my games that are rated 8 or above, so on that metric it is not worth the money.  But I enjoyed it, and if I didn't buy it, I don't think I would have gotten a chance to play it.

RATING: 9.5
One of the most peculiar and unique euro games I have ever played, it was impressive through the simplicity of its rules and yet the depth of the decisions. I would love to play it again and it's one of those games which I see as the holy grail of gaming (at least for a specific type of gamers). Why not a 10? Not enough plays yet... that's the main reason.

RATING: 7
An interesting game that having played once, I am not particularly eager to play again.  

As such, I should probably give TGZ a 6, but I feel like the game has enough interesting mechanics that feel fresh enough to warrant the extra point for clever design.  In particular, the individualized victory point requirements, which are adjusted upwards as helpful card capabilities are added to a player's tableaux, the turn order bidding, the variable pricing, and dispersed payments mechanics, felt fresh and interesting to think about.  

On the other hand, the checkerboard spatial design of the game, and the theme itself, felt very clunky and flat out did not work for me.  Thus, this is a mixed bag of a game that I can see, nevertheless, has some potential to please hard core gamers who want to play around with something new...that plays like a dressed up abstract.

Rating after two plays: there's an interesting game here, though it seems incredibly volatile and heavily influenced by the gods chosen by the players.  I wish that it were longer, so that early commitments to technologies were more important, but this would also require that it was harder to disrupt the other players.  I expect the game to change considerably as players gain a better understanding of it.

RATING: 9
The Great Zimbabwe may actually be my favorite Splotter design to date.  It compacts a wonderful logistic/economic puzzle in a very short playing time.  It's a game with shared incentives, emerging alliances, asymmetry, butterfly effects, and where every decision matters.  It also still feels very different/unique due to its unique mechanisms;  for instance, players can make themselves stronger in the game but do so by making their VP-win condition harder to reach. 

But much of the charm and tension lies with how players attempt to end the game.  Essentially, this is one of those games where players will often maneuver themselves to make a large move towards the end of the game.  Not only does this create interesting situations where players, in last place, end up winning the game... but it also creates situations where a poorly executed maneuver leads to defeat.

Overall, a wonderful game and one of Splotter's best produced games component-wise (certainly better than Indonesia and Food Chain Magnate).

RATING: 6
Rating based on single play. This has some promise, although it suffers from the "Struggle of Empires" problem. You have a lot of options (for Gods/Specialists) early on and have little to evaluate them. Just get through your first game, and you may find yourself thinking about this.

Rating -- Suggest (for now).

the game reminds me of Container - players have so much freedom they can easily break a given play of the game. In my game everyone screwed the resource prices so much all I had to do to win was place 2x 1st level buildings practically every round and won easily (don't remebmer the god name).

I am not saying there aren't interesting things _potentially_ going on here, but same as with Container I am not willing to risk wasting 2 hours on a completely uninteresting play just hoping next time players don't screw the game up.  

I guess I could play this with same group every time, but if I were to do that antiquity or any 18xx game are what I would rather explore fully. zimbabwe with it's shorter playing time had a chance to be a 'casual' brainy game, but not when it can be broken so easily

RATING: 8
Initial Impression: After having experienced Food Chain Magnate, I was wary of getting this game to the table. Another heavy brain-burner? Surprisingly, no. The artwork and component quality of The Great Zimbabwe is typical of other Splotter games that I've experienced but somehow in this setting the sparse artwork just seems more thematic. Gameplay is broken down into a few phases, with a mancala inspired turn-order bid. The meat of the turn involves taking actions in order to create a network for the games' virtual resources to flow, similar in some ways to the route-building of 18xx games. In my mind, the most ingenious mechanism of the game revolves around the scoring system in which you have the choice to acquire variable player powers (gods and specialists) but will increase your target VP requirement in order to win the game. This creates many tough decisions as to whether those powers will yield the extra VPs quickly enough to make it worth the acquisition. In the end, this game is a VP race, which is the type of euro that I truly enjoy the most. This game MUST get to the table again soon.

RATING: 9.5
The Great Zimbabwe (TGZ) is a deep game that feels both fresh and familiar. For the familiar, it shares a number of aspects I like from both Brass and Caylus.  With respect to Brass, this game incentivizes positive interaction between the players via resources being in supply. With respect to Caylus, this game allows players to obtain certain powers (e.g., god cards, specialists and technologies in TGZ; buildings in Caylus) and interfere with some of those powers (e.g., the tiers of craftsmen in TGZ; the provost in Caylus) in a way that allows for a fluidity to game's progression. 

For a few of the fresh aspects, TGZ implements interesting wrinkles on turn order bidding and using VPs as a currency. Regarding VPs as a currency, by requiring a player to increase the end-game target VP upon gaining a power, TGZ finds a good balance between gaining power and remaining efficiently lean. Regarding the turn order bidding, by allowing for the various bids to be re-distributed among the players, TGZ adds a layer of strategy that isn't over complicated.  As a whole, TGZ manages to interweave many interesting, yet fairly simple, sub-systems in a way that allows the spotlight to remain on the players and their actions. Aside from the constant need to check for resource supply, a player rarely struggles against the game. 

To return to the games that share aspects with TGZ, it can also be noted that this game appears a bit easier to jump into than Brass. Additionally, this game appears more replayable than Caylus in view of the meaningful variation that arises due to the randomized map tiles and subset of active god cards. I do prefer Brass's route-based method of supply. But, the remaining aspects of TGZ push this problem to the background for the most part. This is a great game that scales well and can be replayed for a long time.

Finally, for better or worse, the players provide some balancing to the game. Thus, you will need all players fully engaged with the game state (and perhaps equally experienced). Under some game states, players will have to coordinate to stop one of the players from running away with the game (this typically shows up more often in lower play count games, like 3 players). If one player is not aware of what's going on, the remaining players may not be able to counter sufficiently. Luckily, the game is fairly short, so if one player messes up a session, the game is over even more quickly.

Variable board setup with a variable mixture of special abilities provided by the gods.  After 2 plays, some of the gods appear to be "great."  I wonder if being an atheist is a competive option. I'm definitely interested in more plays.  However, I do have some reservations.  Hopefully this game is not as fragile as Container.       

Update:  I find the secondary craftsmen difficult to grasp and frankly unfun.

:d10-3::d10-4::d10-5:

May '16: Finally played twice in a row with the same group  of 4 players. The second game went much faster, as the winner of the first game found a more efficient route to the same type of victory (spend the early game building lots of monuments, and then upgrading them all for two turns in a row). The Herd specialist gained him a ton of money...I mean... cattle, and he was able to take first in turn order and monopolize all of the craftsman. We should have built fewer craftsman and/or jacked up the prices to use them. Seems like the playtime-to-depth ratio of this game is very good. Could easily push its way to a 10 with regular play.

Aug. '14: On my second game (although, it was pretty much re-learning), I played with the gods for the first time. Now, I see where the interesting strategies/counterstrategies come into play. Super-excited to get this to the table frequently. Alas, my playgroup doesn't seem as thrilled.

Now, this is my type of game, gorgeous components, rich, deep theme - and a game unlike any we have in our collection...until now.
Amazing innovative game play, adore one God for the game, victory requirement changes constantly due to aquiring craftsmen or specialist help, you can set the price of goods made by the craftsmen you have built - pure genius.
Very very clever game that is a constantly evolving, living puzzle.
Always up for a game of this  masterpiece!.
Well done Splotter.

RATING: 6
First Play: First impressions; the components do no justify the €80 price tag. The board is made of rather thin card stock and there just aren't that many pieces. The artwork to the board is minimalist. Its OK, just not enough for the money.

The game itself has some clever mechanisms, the turn order bidding works well and the idea that helpful cards make the victory point target further away is a nice touch. However the winner had no specialists, one technology and just plodded through the game. Those of us who were extravagant and earned lots of cattle for our craftsmen still had a big deficit at game end. It seems strange that the successful strategy seems to be to take the most uninspiring route.

Toward game end the turns drag as players can't plan their moves until previous players have taken theirs. AP is an inevitable factor in the game and I would  not wish to play this with ponderous players.

In conclusion I wouldn't buy this if it were half the price. Its an OK game but the clever bits don't seem to justify the weaker aspects. If theme is important to you, then there just isn't one really.

RATING: 7.5
A very thinky spatial puzzle-type game from the folks at Splotter. I admire them choosing a very unique theme but it's ultimately pretty thin. It has an interesting victory point system that your threshold goes up with the more technologies and special powers you decide to take. The game really revolves around the board though and how you place your monuments and craftsmen. As the game evolves, it becomes increasingly important to have first access to resources and the money to pay for it. Definitely need to play this game some more as understanding when to expand, when to take a god power, etc is critical. More plays are likely since this game is in that sweet spot of 90 minutes. I can see the rating going up.

RATING: 7.5
3 player; me, Flo and Brian. Flo had this in the bag up until the last turn when Brian outbid for turn order and was able to use all of the craftsman Flo could reach, blocking her from completing her temple upgrade and winning. This is definitely the lightest of the Splotter games I have played. It seems as if this is really a predecessor of Food Chain Magnate. The range to your craftsman is crucial to being able to build up your temples for VP. Also, knowing which god to take really can dominate your strategy. I liked it quite a bit, but not as much as FCM or Roads & Boats.

Being a Splotter fan, I was looking forward to this title. It did not disappoint! It plays quicker than most Splotter games, but the depth and gameplay is as deep and engaging as their other "gamer's game" titles.

Being a gamer's game, initially there is a lot to wrap your head around as far as rules are concerned, but it all falls into place quickly. That said, the more you play the more depth you discover leading to it being difficult to master.  There are spatial and logistical elements to consider along with an interesting auction mechanic, variable victory conditions and player interaction galore.

 The replay-ability is huge because of the different Gods and Specialist combos available and the production values are among the best that they have produced. All in all, another great title from Splotter that I'm glad to have in my collection.

The hit of BGG.con 2012 for me with just one play.  I love the Victory Requirement (VR) adjustment for grabbing cards which provide different advantages throughout the game.  And, the player-controlled economy of setting prices and determining crafts is magnificent.  I hope for more plays of this.

After two more plays, I'm keeping my rating at an 8 but I don't feel terribly confident about it.  I won both plays (3 & 4 players) with a low VR and a rush to score fast with one tall tower and another short tower.  I don't think that will work every time because others could have slowed me down and didn't.  The player-controlled economy is one of the neatest aspects of the game and also the part that is maybe almost too sensitive.

Interesting Splotter game. They like lots of complexity but at heart this is a fairly simple economic game where your choice is to build a simple engine and get to a low target or spend time building a more powerful engine to get to a higher target. Timing is everything, so not the most enjoyable first play but would probably be one of those games which gets better when played repeatedly in a group.

This one is really growing on me. It is highly abstracted and surprisingly fast playing.

2012, Splotter.

Others say: you must play more than once... and with experienced players... to enjoy this game because you need everyone to consistently keep opponents in check or there can be a runaway leader. Also, if you can make your moves to ensure ALL other players are losing, it can be more valuable than making a move to advance your own game.

Bankler says: it suffers from the "Struggle of Empires" problem. You have a lot of options (for Gods/Specialists) early on and have little to evaluate them. Just get through your first game, and you may find yourself thinking about this.

There's a lot of variation with gods available/chosen. I still don't get it, but there's a lot to get. I routinely underutilize the gods/specialist (except for the Herd). It's tempting to assume a particular god/specialist is too strong, but I'm sure that's a groupthink problem; much of the replay value will come in challenging it.

Three games played and I am really enjoying myself. It has been a while since I have played a game and I am thinking about it daily. I like Antiquity but like this even better because the rules are simpler, easier to explain and a game can be played on a weeknight. Games tend to take about 75 to 90 minutes. Wonderful interaction between the players. This is a Euro with a lot of theme. Choosing the right god is an agonizing decision. So far 3 different gods have won in our sessions (Eshu, Xango and Shadipinyi). Fun, fun, fun. I have only played with 4 players, can imagine that 5 would be really stressful for turn order.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
So far I've played three 2-player games. I suspect more players will be better for stopping the leader; however, 2-player is still excellent.  With the combination of gods and resources and water masses, I expect even playing with the same person, I will get at least 10 - 15 2-player games in before it starts to feel samey.  If I vary the opponent or increase the number of players, I can see this have more replayability than I'll actually ever use.  

The combination of gods and specialists means there is not one path to victory.  Players can start a bunch of monuments and then in the late game upgrade all of them at once or players can can try to have only 3 or 4 monuments and upgrade them before prices rise.  I think money (cattle) management is a key element to this game, although there is several gods and specialists that make this easier.  i think it will be hard to win by focusing on building craftsman but not impossible.  Perhaps Gu + craftsman + a couple of level 2 monuments would be enough.  Yes, 3 plays in and my mind is still reeling with possibilities.  Definitely an excellent purchase.  If the rest of the Essen crop is as good as TGZ, this will be a remarkable year.

Splitter's best game since Indonesia. For me, Indonesia is still their best title, TGZ is their second best.

It has shades of Food Chain Magnate, but it is more streamlined, and much shorter. Not as brutal as FCM. The length of this game is very play friendly.

Our group particularly likes the variable powers, as we love Terra Mystica and Marco Polo; the gods and specialists are totally reminiscent of these mechanics.

After 2 plays, our big concern is how strong the Herd specialist seems to be.

I'd like to start by saying I love the box art... so lovely.   Ok, the game... after one play I am left scratching my head at strategy, and that's probably a good thing.

I would not normally consider rating a game of this complexity after a single play and do so merely in response to Nick Case's rating - I being the player who won our first playing by, as he says, "plodding through the game"  

I did not, as it happens, "plod".  I made what I thought was a mistake by leaving the choosing of my God until all the best had been taken.  So this dictated my subsequent tactics.  From that moment I knew what I was aiming for.  This made my play faster than most.  

Nick is correct in that it is difficult to plan ahead especially in the latter stages when the board gets crowded.  After our first session I wouldn't recommend 5 players (our aim was to teach as many folk as possible).  Also I fully agree that the physical quality of the game is not much different from prototypes I still have knocking around.

But as far at the game itself goes Splotter have presented a game that is sufficiently different and enjoyable to warrant a place on my shelves and this is the basis for my rating; it being up to the purchaser to determine whether those qualities are, in themselves, sufficient to justify the very hefty price tag.

It satisfies that euro itch, and I find it's aesthetics pleasing.   Doesn't bog down like some other euros.   Seems very balanced to me. Component quality is a bit disappointing, though.

first play was 5p with rules teaching and so we called it at 3 hours with 2-3 rounds to go. Length will definitely shorten with more experience as players AP less but more importantly familiarise with the range/hub/craftsmen requirements. From a shortened play, it already seems to me that the timing of the "push" to get the level 5 monument or whatever is needed to pass the VR is very important. 

Looking forward to more plays for sure. Rating will prob go up but not sure what it will peak at.

RATING: 5
Rating this one after one play is tough, because I have a feeling the game could play very differently than the way our first game went.  First game played in about an hour due to someone reaching their goal score very quickly.  If we played again, the likelihood of that happening would be much lower.

I can't really say the game plays much like any other game I've played, and it has some clever ideas, such as requiring players to score more points based on how many abilities they have chosen to take on.  It's a bit of a spatial puzzle trying to figure out what placements benefit you more than the other players, which makes it feel a bit abstract.

The rules are a bit finnicky for my tastes, with several things not feeling all that intuitive, and rather being included for "gamey" reasons.  You really have to play a few rounds before you really start to get some of the concepts, and why the rules have to be the way they are in order for the game to work properly.  It takes a while before the rules are clear since they're not very intuitive.

First impression is that this is more like the Average Zimbabwe rather than great though, and I just don't have a strong urge to play again.

My first Splotter game and I was pleasantly surprised by how quick and simple the gameplay is. Players must pick one of 3 actions to do during their turn but there is certainly a good level of strategic depth to explore in how players build their network of goods and craftsmen. Perhaps the most interesting mechanisms is how the asymmetrical powers you gain during the game are balanced by increasing the number of victory points needed to win the game. Really clever! The presentation is not really engaging but I will definitely go back to this game for the gameplay.

By far my biggest disappointment of the month. Here is 2 hours of my life I will never get back, on a game that we didn't even get halfway through... It's not the fault of the game. It's me, it's not you... we just aren't compatible. I like fun games, like Legendary, and Copycat, and Railways of the World... My tiny brain can't seem to understand the greatness that is the Great Zimbabwe... it is just how it has to be. Sorry... Maybe next time it will be right, but this time... it... just wasn't.

This game is great. I can't wait to dig deeper into the game with future plays.

Splotter does it again with this odd theme. So many innovative mechanics and very deep strategy. Deeply interactive and cut throat.

Four games deep, 2, 3 and 4 player respectively, and this game has everything one could hope for in a 60 - 90 minute game. The tactical nature of game play is what does it for me. TGZ has the exact same qualities that I love in Brass and kept me playing that game for 60+ sessions.

On top of my wishlist of games to get.

Finally got my hands on a copy.

This game is brutal. Similar to FCM, there’s not much one can do to come back after mistakes. The gods are a nice feature. Adding special powers and at the same time increasing victory point winning condition works great. Surprised it isn’t used more in other games. I am also surprised at the retail for this game. Highly overpriced for the components inside. Overall, this one felt very sandboxy and brutal for me. My first play also took nearly 3 hours, so didn’t leave a great first impression, but It is a good game. I wouldn’t mind playing more but would likely have to be in the mood.

Super abstracted and dry.  Very fiddly to calculate costs of transport routes.  Visually confusing.  Fragile, as the game can bog down way too much if players aren't thoughtful enough in setting prices.

Kind of like a mashup of Ricochet Robot and Indonesia, with zero theme.

RATING: 5.5
Some neat things going on, such as how the bidding mechanism works for turn order.  Another interesting mechanic is how the more powerful you get, the more points you need to win, which is innovative.  The bad, unfortunately, overshadows the good.  The board is a mess and hard to read with fiddly 'moving goods' rules that make it very hard to look at the board and intuitively know what to do.  The secondary craftsman, while most likely necessary, adds a layer of unexplicable complexity that takes this game from showing promise to one that adds so much time to a players turn that you find yourself not caring if you win because you just want the game to be over.

I like my one play of this game so far.  Fairly abstract but there's a lot of options and variability to every game.  It is probably more an abstract/euro game, but I like both :).  Would like to play this again.  Probably would get it but it's OOP now :(

RATING: 5
The relatively harsh rating is not a reflection of the game per-se, but instead the level of enjoyment I had with a first play. I heard this game described as a route building game, and that's a style I generally like. However, with this version, the "routes" consist of a grid map, with three-space connections between monuments, and resources, and the buildings that convert those resources.

That works pretty good, but there's two tiers to the buildings, and the 2nd tier really ramps up the complexity of finding the right resources. For me, the board became very hard to read, and it simply didn't "click" with me. 

We also had another player that built buildings in almost seemingly random locations, which really clogged up the board and limited connections. A 2nd play could boost my opinion, but I'll need someone else to suggest this title again before I reach for it myself.

One thing I did like though... the freedom to choose different gods and specialists, with each one adding to the VP total you needed to win. You can have that perk, sure, but now you have to reach farther to win. That's a nice feature that I'd like to see in other games.

RATING: 8
Interesting and fairly clever.  Some concerns about the timing of commitments and the ease of invalidating them.  An unfortunately heavy focus on the acceleration versus time curve as informed by the positional struggled, rather than focusing on the positional struggle as informed by the acceleration versus time curve.  Considerably shorter in development and thus commitment than I'd like -- it would be more interesting if the game were 50%+ longer in terms of turns (which would also be a side effect of moving the focus from acceleration to positional).

Rating may rise as much as 1.5 with further play, but if so I expect it to then fall back over much of the ground it gained.

Update: Rating raised from 6.5 to 8.0.  With additional play and all experienced players, the game finally becomes the turgid deep-read positional fight of position versus tempo versus opportunity I'd hoped for.  

The primary interest is the continual management of all the other player's positions, with barely an afterthought for your own.

Remarkably delicate game of position and liquidity.  Despite superpowers and suggestive synergy this is hardly an "engine building" game in the tableau sense.  Instead, like Container, players are more or less building an engine together where every cog in the machine doubles as foothold that might spring them into drivers seat or else a bludgeon to dissuade the other players from doing the same. 

I can imagine high levels of play producing a very obstructive game ala Paris Connection.  Which I think is a good thing.  

Other surprises include some very nice player scaling (the more the merrier), and even the two player game manages to be tense and chewy.  

All in all, Splotter has another sexy title in their lineup and 2012 another finely-tuned mid/heavy game.  This one starts with a venerable 9.  While I expect many of the other titles of 2012 (Terra Mystica) to become flat at about 20 plays (a good run), I can see this game having wheels.     

Update:
Just played again this evening.  This marked my 15th play and the game is still growing on me.  What a wonderful Splotter.

Another fascinating game from Splotter Spellen.  In this, players compete to be the first to reach the amount of victory points they themselves have decided they need.  Each player starts needing 20.  Victory points are earned by building monuments and craftsmen.  Victory point requirements (VPR) increase, with a single exception, with a technology, craftsman or god that a player may take in order to assist with gaining victory points.  

Play takes place on a grid of squares depicted on tiles.  Except for the starting tile, a number of tiles are randomly selected and then placed in a prescribed configuration.  Movement is key, as raw materials may move only 3 squares to reach the craftsman who needs them.  Orthagonally adjacent water spaces count as one square.  Finished goods may be transported via hubs (any monument) with a payment for each to the bank.

Players may earn zebu (the game's money) with craftsmen and various technology and god cards.  An additional 1-5 zebu are earned at the end of the round according to the height of a player's own tallest monument.  Zebu are used to bid for player order at the beginning of a round and to pay craftsman for their work.  

The bidding mechanism is unique as far as I'm aware.  Plaques belonging to the players are arranged in order from most to least VPR.  In this order, a player bids zebu, at least one more than the previous player, putting a zebu on the next available plaque.  Plaques are filled in order the number of zebu on the plaques and then in VPR order.  In other words, in a 4 player game, if the first player bids 2, a zebu is placed on each of the first two plaques.  If the next player bids 3, the two empty plaques are filled and then, each having a like number of zebu, the final zebu loops back around to the most VPR plaque.  Controlling turn order is a key part of the game.  We originally thought this part of the game could be very AP-ish, but that has proved not to be the case.

It is rare these days to find a game which has me going 'Wow!' after playing it. It is even rarer when I then hunt down a ridiculously expensive copy considering the material included, and purchase it too. The Great Zimbabwe is proof that boardgame 'miracles' still exist.

Splotter has a reputation of creating long, tortuous and demanding games. And that reputation is well-founded. But in TGZ, Splotter managed to reduce much of the administrative cruft that bears down on their designs. They also created very strong and very useful player powers (at a price, of course). And then stepped back to let the players duke it out. The road to victory can and should be a tortuous and bloody affair, with transportation outlooks doing 180 degree-turns in the blink of an eye. But not all that often either, that's the beauty of this system. Players need to learn how to play this title, how to conspire against others using a particular strategy, and how to secure their own position against problematic interference. This is [i]not easy[/i], nor is it meant to be so. But players who persevere will be rewarded with a strong gaming experience.

What I find somewhat less about the game—although it is completely understandable—is that the dynamics in a game for 2 are so very different than in games for 3+. The game for 2 is walking on a knife edge, with a need for meticulous timing and awareness for pulling-the-rug-from-under-your-feet surprise moves. With 3+ on the other hand the need for matters being zero sum is removed, and this introduces all the interaction goodies I mentioned above. There is simply no way to backport the feeling of the 3+P-game onto a 2P-game, and that is somewhat of a shame. C'est la vie.

I hope I can get many more plays out of this title, but it will need a dedicated group of people willing to stomach the little masochism of radically shifting outlooks. Still, what I've seen warrants the unusually high rate of 8, which still has clear potential to grow towards a lofty 9. And that [i]is[/i] truly saying something.

[b]Update[/b] The first set of games in a ... × 10-challenge have really hit home how incredibly necessary each and every aspect of the 'sandbox' in The Great Zimbabwe is, down to the slightest rule. Everything is woven together, most of the time everything has a way out too, and just when you think you have a (fleeting) handle on things a player tries something new which has you reconsidering your approach yet again. There are incredibly fine lines between helping and hurting yourself to master. Mistakes are easily and innocently made, but don't evolve into actual problems until much later when they are fiendishly hard to solve. And on top of that collusion with other players who are just as much your enemies [i]needs[/i] to be factored in. Strangely the game is not really strategic in the usual sense of sticking to a single plan to the end: it's a recipe to lose, in fact. But it isn't tactical either because the time scales involved are too long. But there is a pleasing harmony to it all which renders the necessity of giving a precise definition moot.

It is at this point that I even begin to wonder how in blazes someone manages to [i]design[/i] something like The Great Zimbabwe. It is hard to believe that something as tightly woven as this game arises by chance, but at the same time the amount of play testing by genuinely shrewd and capable players necessary to [i]evolve[/i] it into being makes me want to howl. 

So with that, a 9 it is, the first in a [i]very long[/i] time for me. Well done, Messieurs Splotter, on a design nothing short of brilliance which embodies all your qualities, but as I said above without much of the fiddliness that plagues (too) many of your other designs, and plays in a pleasing and acceptable amount of time too. A rare plea: [b]more[/b]. If anything to offset the mindless consumerism that is Kickstarter.

Glorious. Everything I'd hoped it would be. Moves, countermoves, counters to counters, all stretched over this fabric of spatial positioning and variable player capabilities.

My only issue is tempo of play: it's to one's strong advantage to do some very careful (and, as the game goes on, increasingly tricky) calculations regarding money expenditures and blocking, [i]at least[/i] once every turn. Those can stretch playtime out, sometimes in an un-fun way. I feel I'd like the game most with a pacing that allowed full calculation of straightforward situations, but where you had to start relying on heuristics and instinct as things got more complex. (It'd result in occasional "crap, 2 cattle short" moments, but I'd be willing to take that.)

First play was a 4 player game.  I found it tedious to perform all calculations as to whether a move can be accomplished or not.  And you have to wait for your turn to figure this out.

Interesting part is the decisions allowed for players to determine their abilities at the cost of increasing victory requirements. unfortunately for me, I had a terrible time making sense of the spatial goods transfer portion of the game. Turn order seems too critical in end game. Another BGGer commented best:
"The game starts off with plenty of open ground for a variety of decisions - setting prices to dictate the economy and selecting which power(s) you will use (or not) - but once that phase ends, the game bogs down into jockeying for turn order and a logistical efficiency puzzle. “Can you use up the goods on the board before the other players” is now the game space for clever moves, so you have to be delighted in puzzling that out and watching other players go through that process while you wait and wait for your turn."

My first Splotter. Definitely a luxury purchase but I will cherish it for a very long time. It's the only game I really own that has emergent gameplay. There's so much discovery to be had and each play is so vastly different and dynamic depending on who you're playing with and how the board takes shape.

I have to say though that I still can't give a pass to any designer/publisher who can't put even a tiny bit more thought and work into aesthetics. This game is expensive and all you get is a bunch of plain wooden bits and pieces. I'm told this is one of the prettier Splotter games. Ouch!

Having said all that though. The gameplay really is incredible. I'd recommend watching Heavy Cardboard's playthrough on Youtube if you want to see how it plays.

[6 Oct 2017] - 8 (1 play)
A very interesting game that plays well with 2 players and has lots of interesting decisions to make. The boards are tight and the flow of the game is completely dependent on actions of the players. Players can slow down the game with secondary craftsmen or speed up the game by setting up cheap craftsmen to accelerate the monument building. The rules are pretty straightforward and easy to get down after a few rounds. The turn order bidding looks like it has potential to equalize the game but wasn't all that interesting in a 2 player game. The variable victory point requirements is very cool. Decisions about what gods or specialists to take is a combination of racing other players to get them first as well as weighing the impact that will have on the number of points you need to win the game. Not too long and looking forward to playing it more.

My low rating for this game is a matter of personal preference. I am someone who prefers mid-weight games under 2 hours, yes, but I went into the game with an open mind. Really, in the end it just felt extremely convoluted and dry. Playing the game for the first time, there were obvious mistakes I made early on, and this is definitely a game that punishes you for making mistakes. I wouldn't mind this as much...if the game weren't 3+ hours in length. I will not be playing this again.

The only game which has literally nothing in it that I can criticize.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A uniquely balanced smorgasbord of asymmetric powers in a game focused on opaque player interaction.  At its core, The Great Zimbabwe is a game about semi-cooperatively developing a resource network, and trying to exploit that network the most.  This manifests as a constantly evolving spatially oriented puzzle that is a very satisfying sandbox to play in.  Every action taken has big chunky consequences, as it changes the board-state for everyone for the rest of the game.  Even seemingly benign changes can have significant and unpredictable outcomes, as all players react and build upon it.  It is this core that gives The Great Zimbabwe such a unique level of complex player interaction.

Layered on top are multiple sources of asymmetric powers.  These powers are all potentially game-breaking, yet are all equitable for a few reasons.  Because of the VR boosts associated with each power, the assessment of which powers are even just a net gain is unclear, similar to taking out loans in other games.  Due to the monotheistic nature of the god powers, claiming one of them also comes with an incalculable opportunity cost.  The biggest balancing factor however, is the level of player interaction itself.  Once a power is claimed, the other players can adapt to minimize the return on investment.  These factors force players to be extremely selective about the powers they take.  The most difficult and impactful decisions in the game often come from which powers to take, and just as importantly, when.

Because of the common scarcity of resources, winning the bid for first player in a critical round is often the deciding factor of the game.  Some may see this as a significant detractor for the game.  However, I see this as just another aspect that needs to be taken into consideration when planning one's actions.  In cases where the turn order auction seemingly determines the winner of the game, it was not the auction itself that won them the game, but rather the decisions leading up to that auction that put them in that favorable position.

The artwork and the component quality is good but not spectacular.  It is considerably better than my expectations, given the reputation of Splotter games.  My only complaint is the quantity of silver wooden cows is insufficient for higher player counts.

My first Splotter and it did not disappoint! TGZ delivers a euro game that mainstream euro games lack these days. A very innovative way to maintain balance in the game: Victory Requirements. The more help you get, the more VR you need to achieve to win. Simple yet elegant. The bidding mechanic is another cool feature implemented in the game that I haven't seen it in any other games. The duration of the game fits nicely within 1 - 1.5 hrs with the right amount of depth and challenge. This game got me looking for other Splotter designs. A true gem indeed

Initial impressions after 1 play:
The game reminds me of Tramways for some reason. Instead of delivering passengers however, you're using goods to upgrade your monuments. The puzzle of tracking resources to products, and then to upgraded products, and finally to your monument is difficult to read on a busy board, but I actually enjoyed that puzzle.

I also liked the temptation (which i fell for) of the Gods and abilities at the cost of moving your finish line further down the road.

Overall an interesting, fun, and i imagine much quicker on our next play...game. I feel bad rating after 1 play so I'll leave that blank, but a good game with an interesting player driven economy.

I enjoyed playing the first 2/3s of The Great Zimbabwe.  I really liked the gods cards.  I also liked how the victory point totals changed as you took a god, technologies, and specialists.  The bidding for turn order was fun, too, though others in my group didn't like it as much. 

I didn't like the game's length (too long), that the winner became fairly inevitable with too many turns left, and that the game was unforgiving of small errors.  If this game was half as long, I think I'd like it better.

This is an economic game where you buy and sell goods to eventually build monuments which are worth victory points.  There are other ways to gain victory points however.  To win you need to hit a VP threshold (think Manhattan Project).  There is an interesting twist in this game.  The twist is, you can draft your own unique special powers to help win the game but each special power you take increase the threshold of VP you need to win the game.  This is a pretty quick game in comparison to most Splotter titles.  In addition to that, this Splotter title is not overly fiddly and probably has the shortest play time.  I was hoping it would work for these reason but sadly it didn't.  I felt that the game was a little dry and that if other players allow someone to draft multiple money-making powers they will run away with the game.  A few others have made this complaint as well.  Knowing this, future plays could be better but since Splotter titles are expensive and don't tend to drop in value, I decided to part ways as I don't think the game would ever be something that I would love.

This game... This GAME.  My goodness, what a game.  It's early, but I'm suspicious that this is the game that will force me to re-rate any other games I currently rate a 10 to something more suitable, like a 9.5.  

I'm simply blown away by how perfect this game is.  It's checking all my boxes... it's emergent, highly interactive, opaque, tense and a bit chaotic at times.  I absolutely love how you have to craft a strategic line then be totally adaptive in it's application.  Brilliant.

There are some very neat ideas here, most especially the way you can select bonus powers but they will increase your VP target required for you to win. Is it worth it to have rule-breaking power if it means it will take longer for you to win the game? That’s all very fun, but it’s a much smaller part of the game, the bulk of which is bidding for turn order and spatially arranging things to your favor/your opponents’ disadvantage. 

The game starts off with plenty of open ground for a variety of decisions - setting prices to dictate the economy and selecting which power(s) you will use (or not) - but once that phase ends, the game bogs down into jockeying for turn order and a logistical efficiency puzzle. “Can you use up the goods on the board before the other players” is now the game space for clever moves, so you have to be delighted in puzzling that out and watching other players go through that process while you wait and wait for your turn. 

This is not to my taste, however; too much spatial planning. By the end of the game for me it feels like some sort of court-ordered punishment. To make matters worse, the table looks up to see that one person has a clear advantage and it’s all over but the counting, yet you still have to play it out.

Dry, yes. Expensive, yes. Brilliant, possibly. I am not a fan of abstracts, and this game is riding the razor=thin edge of being abstract, but the game itself is quite challenging to play well, and the design would seem to allow for a number if clever strategies and counter-strategies. Avoid if you hate abstracts, but otherwise worth a look. Make sure you play the rules correctly, and don't judge it on your first play.

This is just an okay game, it absolutely requires repeated play to get the strategies and how to combat what the other players are doing.  It also requires repeated play in a short amount of time otherwise you'll forget what you need to do.

I'm not willing to do that.

This is a game that is the same as lots of other stuff.  You've got variable powers in the gods, craftsman (buildings) that let you convert resources, and some route building.  The only differences with other games is that you don't save resources/goods from turn to turn.

I just don't find the game that interesting.  I don't find myself saying "wasn't that so fun, I used your network to get 2 goods to my monument, how thrilling".  It isn't a FUN game, it's a thinky game where the thinky part of it is just meh.

While the logistics problem is sort of intriquing, a guy in our group won twice without having any craftsmen/god/tech.  He just built up a monument to level 3 by turn 2 before any of the 2nd level tech was out so it was cheaper., and then got 3 other monuments going.  He was usually 3-5th in turn order and never bid on any of that so he just needed to hit 20 VR.

I'm sure there should have been strategies that would have worked to stop him, but I wasn't as interested in stopping if it was plain that he would win in two turns whether or not anyone did anything.

On a 3rd play of this I was able to get the god that allowed me to use the same good for raising monuments, and I also owned the 2 craftsman that were near enough goods to get me to the top.  Couple that with bidding first and I was able to win easily by nabbing all the goods and getting my monuments to level 4 and 3.  The other players could have grabbed a 2nd level craftsman, but that would have just prolonged the game.

The economy is a bit fragile, and 5p is too many, causing the game to drag out with lots of checking resources and paths.

The hubs and distance rules are annoying and slow the game down; the victory-requirement rules are simple but innovative, and I really like the player-set prices and the turn order auction. Nice art and unusual theme too.

There is a lot to like in Zimbabwe. The ability for each player to define his own victory point goal depending on which upgrades he grabs is pretty cool. Most player actions have immediate and tangible effects on the economy, forcing others to reevaluate their position. Over the course of a game there is a noticable shift of interest: resource which are available in abundance at first start becoming scarce when the monuments rise higher and higher while it's roughly the other way around for cattle.

The game has a few other properties that kind of overshadow these features for me, however. Many of the conflicts simply come down to turn order and while it's laudable that turn order is in the hands of the players (through an auction) the system is very simple: early -> good, late -> bad. And as soon as the logistics of erecting your monuments become a little more involved the game easily bogs down in a series of production and transportation calculations. The interesting and game-changing decisions are elsewhere (and have mostly already been made) but this is what takes a major slice of the game time. (And it doesn't fill me with anticipation that many commenters claim that the game becomes longer and slower the more experienced the group.)

That's a pity, really, because the game seemed to show a lot of promise.

Jury is still not entirely in for me on this one. I am beginning to understand how to play, but it is not an easy one to puzzle out, although it plays quick. there is little mercy in the game. actions seem equal but most decisions have a slight edge over each other. It is tiny, but in the long run it can reveal to be fatal mistakes when choosing less optimally. 

The board placement is really rough to figure out.

TGZ is my favorite game. My #1. It is an exquisite blend of spatial interaction, an awesome auction mechanism, special player powers, volatile commodity speculation, and a very innovative scoring system. The game is about studying the board and developing a strategy according to it but more so it is about reacting to the other players' actions and adapting to the ever changing state of the game. The variability of the game board is off the charts. The game scales extremely well at all player counts (2 to 5). All the gods, specialists and craftsmen are very well balanced in regards to the victory points they add to the players' victory  requirements. It is amazing how every game is different due to the mix of the gods available and the board configuration. The way lakes work is also another element of the game that makes it so variable. The dynamism here does not compare to any other game I have ever played and what is more fascinating is that even though the status quo of the game is always evolving it is very easy to assess who is doing what in order to counter play or to seize emergent opportunities. The fact that there are craftsmen and secondary craftsmen for the available resources takes the logic puzzle of demand and suppy to a whole new level. A player is never safe from indirect attacks on the economy so managing the situations, adjusting and outperforming your oponents is key. The game is so subtle that it could be won or lost in a single auction round of the game (by the way, it's an incredible auction mechanic that I haven't seen in any other game). All of this contained in sessions of 30 to 90 minutes... What else can you ask for? 

Every time I play it I see something new, new synergies, new strategies. It never ceases to surprise me. It's my favorite game. It's just mind blowing.

Another deep game by Splotter.  Leaves you thinking after every play.  Would not recommend with 5 unless you're willing to play a slower game and have players that are generally good picking up the rules (or have played before).

This game seems to suffer from the same issue of all splotter games, exponentially increasing fiddliness as the game progresses. The game itself is fine, there are some interesting things going on but I found it a bit boring and far too much down time in between turns. Also, what you do on your turn is pretty simple. On the plus, there are some choices that actually matter.

Players: 2 to 5 (escalates very well)
Length: around 90 mins
Mechanics: territory building, network building
Decisions: a lot
Opinion: one of my favorites Splotter games, I would say... a Splotter experience in less than 2 hours.
In this game you will try to make your African tribe has more prestige than the rest, for doing so you will erect monuments, improve them and build craftsmen to help the improvement.
Rules can be hard at the beginning, but once you are done with the game it is a game that can be played in less than 2 hours, with all the depth it has.
Turn is really easy, an amazing bidding mechanic to establish turn order, select specialists or which God you will have, erect a new building or build some craftsmen or improve your monuments. The game has some original mechanics...
The bidding system is awesome, money is almost always in the game, just changing hands, in the auction you are bidding for turn order, but the money is placed over the plaques of the different tribes, and they will receive that money once the auction ends.
Same goes for almost all actions, when you activate a specialist, the money would be back at the end, when you use an already built craftsmen the money will go to the owner at the end....
Then the winning condition is also terrific, because you need 20 VP to win, but this will change with anything you do during the game, if you have the benefits for that God you will need 5 VP more, but for that other one you will only need 2 VP more.
The flow of the game is also very dynamic, turns go very fast but with very hard decisions, should I go for building craftsmen and receive money, but helping others to improve their monuments, or should I go just for monuments. All Gods are very well balanced and the combinations you can create are enough to be playing this game hundreds of times.
In a nutshell, deep and dynamic game, with lot of options and many things to consider while playing. Just amazing.

Thoughts after one play:

I liked it, and look forward to playing again. The best Splotter games feel amazing and wonderful from the very first play (Indonesia, Antiquity, Greed Incorporated). The Great Zimbabwe didn't impress me at that level, but I would rank it ahead of the other Splotter titles I've played (Roads & Boats, Duck Dealer, Cannes, Oraklos ... still haven't tried Bus). I do think there is a small but significant chance that The Great Zimbabwe could enter that top tier once everyone knows the ropes. The first time through, it's a little difficult to see the implications of some of your decisions about where to build the craftsmen and how high to price their goods. A lot of this will of course depend upon the gods, specialists, and craftsmen the other players have chosen.

The Great Zimbabwe is a very good logistics game.  The random board layout and the available Gods make each game different!  I love how the acquisition of special power increases your victory point requirement to win.    The only other Splotter I've played is Food Chain Magnate.  The Great Zimbabwe is more abstract but is less punishing if you make an early game mistake.  It also plays faster.  I've played a 2 player game in 50 minute!
I want to play more to see all the God's power.

I liked it for its speed of play with a few players and the cool ideas - turn auction and variable VP goal.  Some plays feel a bit kingmakery as you have to use resources and the one you chooses will likely hurt one player more than another.  Plus, it is not that easy to figure out who is ahead to target the leader.

I usually feel good rating and commenting games (provisionally) after one play, with more to come if I play more. This-- the first Splotter I've played-- was clearly beyond my experience and not something I was ready to understand. I loved the glimpses I got of what was going on and am pretty sure I would enjoy a game made up of what I saw... whether playing this more would reveal that this is that game, or whether the layers I couldn't grok would turn out not to be fun for me, who knows.

Another Spotter is always a good thing, but this time the price tag of 75€ seems much to high. There arn't 1000+ tiles like in Antiquity and R&B, instead this has a fairly common amount of pieces. I guess other publishers would have this at 40€.

However, away from that, it's a good game with a nice end game condition, as you choose to increase the needed points or not. The more you "buy", the more points you'll need to win the game.

The game itself was kind of unusual, atleast for me, but in the end, it's just another resource game with a production chain.

   The Great Zimbabwe has some interesting mechanics that mesh well within the game. Unfortunately, most of the playing time is spent calculating costs and puzzling out what to do. 

   Very often, a player will say "I want to do X" and the next five minutes is spent with all players staring at the board figuring out if, how, and at what cost the player can do this. Looking at the board is just not intuitive and the theme does nothing to aid in this regard. The theme is unhelpful as a mnemonic to figure out the mechanics (which is a killer in game of this complexity). I think it is likely that it would become second nature after several plays, but the complexity of these calculations seems to add nothing in terms of depth of decisions to the game.

   For a game with such a high price tag, the component quality is not up to snuff either. I had several of my wooden pieces that were chipped or had missing paint. Most egregious though, is the meager quantity of cow tokens (at least when playing with five players) that had us making change before nearly every single turn. As if the game needed to make you waste more time fiddling with bits.

   On the plus side, the "god cards", (of which you can only take one per game) do an excellent job of dictating a strategy for you, while your decisions each turn are much more tactical. That aspect reminded me a bit of the cards in Agricola, while the tactics on the board felt a bit like Tempus (just focused more on connections than conquest). 

   You'd probably have to twist my arm pretty hard to get me to try this one again. I just don't see any experience or mechanic here that isn't replicated in a different game with significantly less puzzling and fiddling.

RATING: 9
The Great Zimbabwe is, in short, a 2(ish) hour highly interactive economic-acceleration (but never hitting full speed) Euro with a beautiful hand-drawn aesthetic. Set in Africa, Zimbabwe to be precise, the economic focus comes in beautifully: players are diverse cultures vying for importance while still being deeply interconnected. Short of Martin Wallace's Brass, I've never seen such a necessary intertwining of players actions in a game that isn't one of negotiation -- the cattle, the currency of the game, must flow outward if it is to flow in. To be too greedy in setting prices or refusing to buy from others is to assure one's own demise. The gods and the specialists further modify the economy by providing each and every player rule-breaking powers -- but always at a cost. Each and every time a player takes on an additional ability, their personal winning goal pushes back even further so you must always ask yourself if the acceleration to your engine is worth the additional distance.

My high rating is also from playing the game with 2, a count at which this game also shines: a rare feat for economic/interdependence games.

Also, as an aside,  I think Splotters are best played with a few computational errors (for comedic effect) here and there ("oh no! I'm short a golden calf!")

RATING: 8
(05/31/2014) Comment based on one play, without specialists and using the beginner's set of Gods.

This is a quick-playing, interesting cut-throat and economic snowball game, that is creatively shrouded with dense and intricate network-building, resource conversion, and varying victory conditions.

The objective is to score VP equal to a player's unique victory requirement (VR), which starts the game at 20 points. Players can score VP through building monuments (1 VP each), upgrading them (+2/4/6/8 VP for each level added), or by building craftsmen (1-3 VP each). However, a player's VR can increase (ranging from -2 to +7 VR) throughout the game, depending on if the player chooses a God, a Specialist, or getting craftsmen technology. The severity of the increase is proportional to the relative power and utility of the God, Specialist, or technology.

A God card permanently gives a player a asymmetrical game-benefit, such as breaking a rule of the game, or additional income. However, each God card is unique, and a player can only have one for the entire game. This is similar to choosing a saint in Antiquity, but players are free to choose a God at any point in the game. As stated before, the player's VR is adjusted, with the seemingly more powerful Gods shifting the VR further to the right. Specialists also give players unique powers, but they can have more than one in each game.

Craftsmen technology give players the ability to place craftsmen buildings onto the geomorphic mapboard, which has a random assortment and location of raw resources--trees, clay, ivory, and diamond. Craftsmen turn raw resources into "ritual objects", which are then immediately used to upgrade monuments with additional layers. The higher the monument, the more distinct ritual objects are required for the next successive level. Just like in Tikal, more levels equals more VP. Further, each player receives income for their highest level monument level achieved. 

There are primary and secondary craftsmen available, with each having differing building costs, VP, and VR adjustments. There are four types of primary craftsmen, and each can create a unique ritual object from a specific resource. Each craftsman must be placed within the vicinity of at least one resource that is distinctly within range of them (3 spaces, orthogonally or diagonally on the square grid map). There are three secondary craftsmen that are associated uniquely with three of four primary craftsmen. Later in the game, as secondary craftsmen are placed on the board, the ritual objects made by the primary craftsmen soon no longer can be used for monument upgrades. Instead, the primary ritual object must be "delivered" to the secondary craftsman, through a network of "hubs" consisting of monuments of all of the players. The secondary then creates a value-added ritual object by adding to the primary ritual object, by incorporating an additional raw resource that they have local access to. This secondary ritual object can be used for monument upgrades. Interestingly, there is no tracking of resources like most Euros; as resources are depleted, they are marked accordingly on the map. Other craftsmen in range cannot use depleted resource sites. However, the depletion markers are removed each turn.

The game has a straightforward turn sequence. Turn order is determined by a unique bidding system, similar in feel to that of Hollywood Blockbuster, where the money (the cows) is distributed back to the players--the money supply stays constant. Then, in turn order, each player can choose a God or Specialist, and then choose one action: 1) Build a new monument site, subject to restrictions; 2) Conduct a craftsman action--a) get a tech card, b) buy/build a craftsman, c) set prices for ritual objects; or 3) Upgrade a monument, subject to availability and range of raw resources/craftsmen to get ritual objects. When everyone has finished their one action, players receive income in cows equal to the height of their monument, plus any cows paid to craftsmen that they own, if they produced ritual objects this turn. Interestingly, any money paid to one's own craftsman, will return back to them. The only way the money supply shrinks is payment of use of hubs (to deliver ritual objects to monument sites) and buying/building craftsmen. Finally, there is a check to see if a player has met their victory condition (VP = VR). If not, rinse and repeat until this occurs.

The game starts out with players either buying/building tech/craftsmen, in order to gain income from other players, or upgrading their staring monument to increase income. Early on, the turn order bidding is not important, but as more craftsmen show up on the board, and more ritual objects become available for monument upgrades, the turn bidding becomes progressively heated. Eventually, a player may make so much income that they can "buy" the turn order, build up their monuments, deplete the resources, leaving few or nothing for the other players. In this manner, it feels like an economic snowball similar in feel to Outpost. There comes a point, where it is not possible to stop a player from winning. However, the knee in the curve is hard to discern in this game, due to the complex interrelationships between the resources/craftsmen/hubs/monument sites, as well as the actions of the other players. It may be simply a matter of discovering and exploiting the optimal relationships, as well as timing.

The components are good for a Splotter Spellen game, with thin, but sturdy cardboard for tokens and resources, tech cards, and map. The graphics is very good, with steady improvement over Antiquity. However, the rules, as written, seem poorly written (or translated). There were many references to the BGG rules forum on our first play. Seemingly easy concepts were inadequately explained, with few useful examples. The player aid was useless, as it did not contain sufficient detail. Instead, one of the player aids downloaded from BGG was much more helpful, but even that had missing key words. This made our first play frustrating and long. However, once understood, the game is easy to explain and teach. Some concepts may take a turn or two to grasp fully. However, players familiar with network-building and resource deliver/conversion will have little difficulty.

This is a rich, dense game, with many interesting decisions, despite the fact that it plays relatively quickly compared to Splotter's other games, such as Indonesia, Antiquity, and Roads & Boats. The downside is that it feels thematically weak in terms of integration, because it feels more like an abstract due to its cut-and-dry deterministic decision space, sort of like playing chess. The first few plays may be frustrating, as there is plenty to digest and explore in this game. However, it is suspected that richer gaming experiences await for those who are patient and determined. It may be a "great" game, but limited production and distribution will probably keep this title down in the ranks. The comparatively high asking price should not keep dedicated medium-to-heavy weight gamers away. Initial rating is a strong "8".

This game is incredibly rewarding and I always enjoy it. It is a tense brain burner. After you get the main concepts the game play is simple enough, but the level of depth and strategy is unparalleled. Great game. It should be much higher ranked. Probably low because splotter games are expensive.

The Great Zimbabwe is a very deep game that doesn't take too long, has an elegant and simple rules set and presents a delightful, stimulating mental puzzle. This game looks great on the table and the rule breaking god cards are awesome! Who knew erecting monuments and raising them could be this much fun?

RATING: 10
For now this is one of my favorite games, albeit we'll see how this score holds over time. The rules are (relatively) simple, but provide much more depth and decision-making than you'd think would be there.
Trade routes and placement make this game much more interactive than I would expect a Euro like this to be. No multiplayer solitaire here. The modular boards and different gods selections make the game require new strategies each time.
Imagine a game with Brass's trade interaction merged with Dominion's elegance and modularity and you might wind up with The Great Zimbabwe. Great, great game.

[b]2 Player Review:[/b] 

Our dream come true! Famous for their expensive games, I approached my first Splotter title wearily by doing a ton of research. I made sure the game would match well with my and Yuki's tastes before making the financial plunge. But we are both so glad we did.
 
This is truly a game that only gets better with more plays. As the modular map is layed-out for each game we find ourselves getting excited over the possibilities. And as each game wraps up we are being consistently surprised with different god, specialist and tradesman combinations that won the day. 

Our first game took 30 minutes as Yuki rode the god [i]"Tsui-Goab"[/i] ability to victory. Our second game was much the same and we scoffed at the comments that suggested a 90 minute playtime. But by the third game we already found ourselves at over an hour's playtime as we became familiar with the fact that ever powerful action has a counter-action. The back and forth got more and more intense as I worked hard to counter Yuki's [i]"Tsui-Goab"[/i] resource exploit for a second time by shutting down his monopolizing of pottery. I ended up winning against a tactic that he had won with so easily with in our first game. But with that said, I`ve also lost a game in 10 minutes flat!

Once all is said and done, this is a game we will be playing a lot over the years to come and has shot to the top tier of both our favorites list. 

[b]Pros:[/b] 

- A very simple set of rules with an amazing amount of permutations. 
- You can't wait to get back into the game and try a different combination of powers.
- The random modular board and singular specialist power each game gives massive re-playability. 
- The back and forth in a two-player game is incredibly satisfying as you are forced to use each others tradesman, and compete for first place to get a hold of resources endgame. 
- The game looks fantastic and really tells a story once you finish playing.
- Some very fresh and innovative game-play mechanics such as first-player order determination, the increase of Victory Requirement with acquisition of abilities, and the ways of countering the monopolizing of resources. 

[b]Cons:[/b]

- The more you understand the combinations of powers and resources, the longer the game takes.
- Going from not caring about the turn order at all, to throwing everything you have at it the next moment, can feel a little extreme at times. 
- Going second in later rounds, usually means you`ll have no resources remaining to choose from which always leave a little bit of a hopeless feeling. You always know it`s game over at least a round before the end of the actual game.
- The concept of the second-level factories and their relevance is always hard to explain to newcomers.

RATING: N/A
After 1, 2 player game; I'm not regretting dropping the cash on this. I like the quick play time; it only took my wife and I a couple of hours to play despite learning the rules from scratch (while eating lunch).

TGZ manages to cram a lot of the feeling of the bigger Splotter games such as Antiquity, Roads & Boats and Indonesia into a tight and elegant little game with much less fiddlyness than usual.

RATING: 6
Lighter game (~2-3h) than typical Splotter design.

Very hard to describe good and bad sides of this game in precise manner.  Imperfect try: 
+ original mechanism of defining your own VP goal through taking cards which help you, but add victory requirement points
- too AP-prone (resulting in the excessive playing time compared to what the game offers)
- bipolar development of the game in later stages (either you have money, bid high and have a chance to build stages of monuments or you don't have money, stay low and gather cash for an attack in the next turn)
- transportation rules (core of the game) are badly presented/ambiguous

But all in all I just don't have enough fun from playing the game in order to keep it.

Sold.

RATING: 8.5
Variable player powers: Auctions: P/U & Del (Delivery really with "Container-like" pricing at p/u points)

Very interesting and fairly original game (even if mechanics are not), the first thing you notice here is what I really like about Splotter; minimal rules that generate very interesting, seemingly deep and multiple approach gameplay. The theme works but isn’t that strong at all for a Splotter, its much more about important board placements and grabbing cards you think will augment your strategy (they can point the way really if good enough in a couple cases, and I should note there are at least 2 that seem wayyyy better than the rest, don't let someone get both...). There are a nice array of card powers to choose from and combined with the randomly built map hopefully this will be enough to boost replay. 

Game had a pretty good flow and often some turns could be very quick, should only run 2 hours or even 90 mins for fast players but can vary on market conditions somewhat, my game ended on turn 7 which surprised me so can be a real mad dash to the finish line here. The only “knock” which isn’t much of one, is some turns you need to analyze the cheapest “routes” to upgrade your built monuments, and this can be a just a little intensive/calculative, but believe me I am reaching here to find a negative, so really with more play this could even become a 10 for me (it got my highest rating possible after one play [8.5] which I expect to rise after a couple more plays to 9).   

Probably my favourite Splotter played so far edging out Antiquity and Indonesia. Definitely want to explore this one more to see if it has enough depth, room for creativity and variability in approaches to give it legs. A little surprised at the amount of people that didn’t enjoy this one, it is calculative in the later game but I never felt that much so, but I guess logistics games do feel dry to many people, I’ve always liked them though. A shame about Splotter pricing making them tougher to obtain

RATING: 9
The Great Zimbabwe is a unique resource management and logistics game with just the right amount of player interaction.  The game has an intriguing victory condition system where each player strives for a varying victory point total, which is derived from his or her use of certain abilities chosen throughout the game.  This is a fascinating concept, and really does impact decision making as play progresses.

While this would have been a strong pure-abstract game on its own, I quite like the chosen art style and feel that the theme/presentation ties in nicely with the game's mechanisms.

More plays are needed for me to have better perception of the game's strategic depth.  But, this is a relatively quick game with very tight gameplay.  So tight, that I can see where one early "bad" decision can be what causes you to lose the game.  

The modular board and various special abilities available to the players should mean that no game conditions will ever be the same.

RATING: 8.5
Man, this is a tough one to describe. The fact that you're drafting for your various bonuses and abilities and that they increase your victory point goal is really cool, as you have to find the right balance between having strong enough powers to get you through the game while not pushing the point goal too far out of reach. But then having the highest point goal also gives you a slight advantage in the turn order auction, and turn order is very important, especially later in the game.

The coolest thing though is probably how the economy of the game works. Almost all of the money that's in the game stays in and just moves from player to player, and new money only gets added in fairly slowly, so finding the right balance there where you're providing goods that other players want so you have a good money flow is important, but so is making sure you're not giving things away too cheaply and letting your opponents build up too easily. But of course, the various powers that you can draft throw quite a few wrenches into the whole thing, as most of them seem to affect how players can buy and use the various goods that other players provide. And a lot of this also comes down to various spatial aspects of the board.

Turn order auctions in the last turn or two seem pretty definitive, but that doesn't bother me too much, because the rest of the game is about making sure you are in a position to win the turn order auction the turn you can win the game. Overall, a game that's really interesting and that I feel like I haven't come close to figuring out yet. Though crucially, I do feel like I'm learning something each time I play. Plus it has a pretty unique theme and art that I find charming and appropriate. I look forward to many more plays.

rating after 1 play... lots of God's and specialists that I'm going to need a couple more plays at least to really know if I like it or not.  I did like my 1st play but I worry 2nd half of game options are down to starting a new monument or growing monuments.  Also the God that lets you use already used resources seems awfully powerful as it allows you to not really worry about bidding for turn order as you can use already used resources, and if you do go earlier in turn order you can use each resource twice.

Dull, straight forward. Dry and a little fiddly. Felt and looked like something from the late 90s. Some unimaginative mechanics and playing pieces. The concept is good (gods, specializations, etc.) as well as the scoring which was interesting (when you select a god or specialization, the more powerful it is, the more points you need to win).

Wanted to like it but the abstractness and "mathing out" pathways to nearest tokens to make a legal play became tiresome.

The Great Zimbabwe is at least good, possibly great. Some gamers I know and respect think Zimbabwe is the best Splotter title yet.

I've decided against buying it for the same reason I haven't bought Roads & Boats either. There's a lot of spatial shortest-path calculation in the logistics like goods deliveries in Indonesia, but with a fuller permutation tree to calculate out. Not something I can pull off without suffering extreme fatigue.

I'd be happy to play it every once in a while if someone else in my group bought it though. The powers of the gods and specialists are very diverse and interesting, as are the variable victory requirements.

If the logistics don't seem daunting, I recommend purchase even at a high price point.  Unfortunately Great Zimbabwe is not a game I can play 50 times, more like 10, and that seems not nearly the amount of play this title warrants.

Update 4/2013: Downrating from 8 to 7. Such a frustrating game to play.  I think it's an excellent game but I'm struggling to find the fun in it.  Deserves a couple more plays.

In Zimbabwe, players are African tribes building networks of monuments. On a turn, you can place a new monument, raise the levels of existing monuments (any that you qualify to raise), or build craftsmen to produce the ritual goods necessary to raise monuments. You can also select a god or a specialist card to give you a special ability for the rest of the game. Choosing a god or specialist, or building a craftsman, raises the victory points required for you to win the game. As the game evolves, every player is shooting for a different victory point goal depending on what each selected or built. 

The fastest way to points is to raise your monuments, but every level raised requires an additional finished good, so access to craftsmen is key if you want to get those points. An equally valid strategy, though, is to not build any craftsmen and spread wide to hit a lower point goal. Any approach in-between these extremes can be a winning strategy as well - creating a huge palette of options and strategies, typical of the best Splotter games. Open-ended, creative, thought-provoking. This is why Splotter.

Personal #1 (spot previously held by [thing=26990][/thing]).

That hard, clean crack you heard ripping through the crisp, autumn night? That was the Splotter boys hitting one outta the park.

Splotter scores big with their least fiddly and most streamlined title to date. A fantastic logistics game driven by a shared economic engine with tremendous timing torque. Not unlike running on a treadmill whilst having monkey wrenches tossed at your feet, Zimbabwe is replete with crisitunity. One of those rare games designed without guardrails. Careen around corners at your own risk, there is nothing but cliff and air. This is not to be missed.

No major publisher could get away with such a game as the target group for it is limited. 
I can understand why many gamers from this target group love the Great Zimbabwe. It's a brainy challenge to build up logistic chains, forcing other players to use your infrastructure while leeching from other players' builds providing a multitude of strategic options. The idea of individually raising the vp requirement depending on player choices is pure genius.
I also can understand why the majority of gamers won't immerse themselves in this experience. Towards the end, single turns easily take a few minutes and considerable effort is needed if players want to rewind their move. It's fiddly, confusing and needs players to keep themselves in check to avoid one player moving unreachably ahead with a strong combo of gods, specialists and craftsmen.
I can't make up my mind how detrimental the experience of the drawn out moves toward the end is on my personal enjoyment of the Great Zimbabwe with so many complex strategic games out there without this weakness.

This is a game that gives a new challenge every time.  From the random selection of gods to the random board setup and random resources, players have to be very adaptable to win this one.  I've rated it an 8, I may bump it to a 9 if it keeps playing so well.

RATING: 9
I actually enjoy this Splotter title more than Food Chain Magnate however I cannot rate it higher than FCM. This game allows for more fluid responses to your opponents' actions and lets you "feel your way" through the game more. 

My first issue with TGZ is that not all of the gods seem relevant at various player counts. I have yet to see Qamata (the hub god) used. I also have yet to see Dziva used effectively. Yes, they are a lower VR, but I'm not sure it's worth taking up your god slot. 

My second issue is how often situations arise where one player gets to choose which of his/her opponents will win the game. This makes turn order very important in the final rounds and is probably something that could be accounted for, yet I still see it crop up often.

RATING: 10
When I thought about it as a very abstract economic game I figured I didn't need it. When I thought about it as a very economic abstract game I had to have it. 

Update after play: This is slick, fast, deep and fun. A ton of flavor and interest is packed into it, but it still nearly retains the purity of an abstract. I like how specialization/asymmetry is created by the players during the game, not before it starts. The artwork is fantastic. The network building and "coopetition" elements remind me of Brass.

Further update: bumping to 10. This game is low on rules, high on tough and interesting decisions, player interaction and has a very reasonable play time.

A fascinating game. The first game was immediately followed by half an hour of speculation, which is a good sign.

Basically it's a game where early on you try to set up a combination of strategy + special powers with good synergies. This is made slightly more interesting by the selection of special powers varying from game to game. In this phase of the game it almost feels as if the map isn't needed for anything (or at least it felt like that in our game, could be that this was due to the map having a very large lake that made logistics a lot easier).

Then ever so slowly the game starts to reach a point where players are no longer limited by money (which mostly just enters the game, so the players as a whole are getting richer and richer). And then suddenly there's a tipping point, and the money stops being the main constraint, and instead the players are limited by the total resource availability on the board. And at that point it becomes a game of turn order and spatial connectivity, as you try to set up turns of being able to reach sufficiently many resources (or use up all tiles of a critical resource to block someone else from using it).

I owned this game for years and sold it unplayed. I was happy to be taught the game, since Splotter has a penchant for concise rule sets. I'm in favor of brevity, but I often would like to see more examples and support in their rule books.

But I was delighted to discover that at heart The Great Zimbabwe is quite simple, but the decisions contained in the game are very interesting. You wouldn't know it by looking at the game components, but this a tight struggle that looks like it would be different every time.

Also, I have to recommend the excellent theme. Why not try something different? On a side note, this is my 2001st rated game here on BGG.

Just one play, so my rating is more of an indication of my interest in further plays.  Zimbabwe strikes me as a clever game, and featuring lots of room for clever play and variable approaches to your formula to win.

It is a logistics game, and a somewhat intense one.  I do appreciate the relatively short playing time, (about 2 hours).  I had some trouble reading the board, but the depletion counters do their job.  Compared to Indonesia, I appreciated that Splotter has used some colors off of the brown/tan spectrum.

The advanced goods gave me pause.  They added more expense and complication to achieving the goods you need to improve your monuments.  I suppose I am just being a wimp, but I mostly felt fatigue when I saw what they did to the gamescape.

This is a game certainly worthy of many plays.

Initial rating, after two plays.

The Great Zimbabwe is unlike anything else I have played. The player interaction is high, which is something my group loves. The theme is integrated amazingly well, and the artwork is phenomenal. The game itself is quite simple, as there is only really one thing you will do on each turn (but you can do it multiple times). However, managing the resources on the board, and timing their use, is key to victory.

I love the fact that there is no secret information, and that luck is not a factor at all. There are opportunities for analysis paralysis, when it comes to calculating the results of your final couple of turns, but that occurs in most Euro games. It seems like an engaging and challenging game with tons of replayability. Time will tell.

Oh Splotter you disappointed me with this one after Indonesia, Food Chain, and Roads & Boats. The game seems to have a runaway leader problem. Not enough craftsmen, specialists to choose from. If you're not making a steady cow income because you there's no more tech for instance you really get stuck in a rut, if people charge too much for their cows and you're not generating a lot of cows what can you do. The game is not friendly to new players. People seemed to grasp the idea of range with Food chain over Zimbabwe. If you play this, I recommend not playing with 5.

There is so much going on in this game despite the simple rule set. Route building, blocking, adding goods and the auction are all very reminiscent of Age of Steam, but each of those elements is given an additional dimension in TGZ.
And oh boy does every decision count.

I really like the fact that you and your opponents get to co-create a working economy throghout the course of the game, step by step.

Only played a 2p game so far, I'm really eager to try it out with 4.

Update: amazing with 4p, 2p experience suffers from a strong zero-sum syndrome and boring turn-order bidding compared to higher player counts. It's still enjoyable though.

Surprisingly short strategy game for Splotter. Don't focus on long-term build-up, because the game might be over before you realize. Nevertheless a very tight struggle where the slightest mistake will be ruthlessly punished. Aim for position and time your acceleration wisely. Some of the gods seems a bit unbalanced. Played with 2 and 3 players, each time in about one hour. Played once with 5 players. Seems better with more players.

- The bidding for turnorder does not work well with 2 or 3 players. 

This game is a lightweight ruleswise but the heavyness comes from analysing the gamestate and acting/planing properly as every decision counts. One wrong move can cost you the win or give an opponent the victory if they dont make any mistakes. In that way it's pretty brutal.

Rating is for a two player game. I think it might take pretty long with more players.
The turnorder bidding is again spot on. 
Start player might be overpowered ( certainly the advantage of having to bid first) but I am not sure.  I think how the bidding works that it is mostly taken care of.
If it really is a problem you could have the last player in turnorder turn one tile in a two player game and three tiles in a more players game.
That should take care of it.
I like how the VP goal shifts. You still have to use the gods.

I am not sure about the scoring of adding to the temple.
In a two player game I found it to be spot on.
In a more player game I could see the second generation of goods slow the game down. A lot. For that reason I was surprised the scoring of the different layers of the temple was the same for 2 as it was for 5.

Anyway. the turnorder mechanism or the VP goal shifting are brilliant design decisions.

Would love to have more sturdy cards and thicker meeples. I'm excited to play it again.

A fun, fast and (slightly) more euro-y splotter. For the time it takes I enjoy it a fair bit, though it doesn't feel like it does it's own thing as distinctly as some other games, and doesn't shine as bright as something like Indonesia.

Though the game varies from play to play in detail, the general concept it the same each time, so play feels broadly similar. Its brevity means the dramatic shape of the game is unlikely to expand much with future plays.

However it is a fun strategic and tactical experience for players that can clock in around 60mins or less, which is not to be scoffed at.

The first time I played it I felt like I had a handle on it.  It must have been a particularly easy board set up.  The second time I just could not get a handle on it!

It's funny, my first instinct was to compare this to Neuland; which itself is an omage to Roads and Boats.

Essentially you have a abstract quasi-pick-up-and-deliver game with special powers. It's fast and intense, the only real down side is for those who have poor spatial visualization skills, who'll have trouble plotting their turns and the costs involved. 

Otherwise we have a fine addition to the Splotter stable.

Nice, nice game.  Very pretty to look at (graphic design and illustration-wise), so-so in the information design department, pretty rough in the rulebook department.  Fun, challening, and not the brain-twisting mind-melt in terms of topology I thought it would be after having the rules explained to me.

Have played this predominantly with two-players and I'm sure the game is better at higher player counts.  My one three-player game was the most interesting.  Three players added a whole new dynamic as turn order became much more important and bidding got quite fierce in the later rounds. And even though the number of land tiles was increased proportionally (from four for two players to six with three), the board seemed much more constricted.

I am impressed.  This one is now one of my favorite games.  Another unforgiving Splotter game, but this one does not have the lag by design that FCM has (I hate how FCM makes me feel when I play it).  Every action matters, and you feel the impact of every decision as soon as you make it.  Plays a lot faster.  Scales very well from 2 to 5 players.  A thrilling ride at 100 mph on a winding road next to a tall cliff without guardrails.  This is a nailbiter.  Zero luck, full information, beautiful graphical presentation (also original look and theme) and clear iconography.  Looks and feels like a game for adults and a classic like Chess or Go.  Rules overhead is small enough that the rules can be mastered with just a few plays and can be taught fairly quick.  What you do with those simple rules is where the game shows its tremendous depth. And it plays quickly enough, keeping you engaged with every move.  Bravo Splotter!

Played once. Another one of those games where the players together form the economy and carving out a niche for yourself can be key to success. Which is a nice mechanism but one I generally suck at and thus not enjoy so much.
The victory requirement track, where your VP target increases as you collect more special abilities and technologies, is a really fun mechanism.
Unfortunately, this is all overshadowed by a transport system for resources and produced goods that is hard to see to the untrained eye and just painful to apply everytime. I'm sure it's possible to get better at this - so you can see at a glance if something is possible or not - but for us every move was a five-minute exercise in counting steps between every possible resource and craftsman on the board.
Unlikely to play again.

(10/17) 9.  The second Splotter I've played and my favorite.  The rules are straightforward and simple but the strategy is deep.  I love the "game breaking" powers as well as the way the more powerful a power you select is, the more points you (and just you) are now required to score in order to win.  My #8 favorite game of all time.

My lowest ranked Splotter Game at the moment. Probably I had too high expectation on it. While it's not bad, but it misses grand strategy of R&B, Antiquity or Indonesia.
Maybe I'm too harsh about it.

After 9 plays I have feeling that's more strategy that I thought previously and it's tempting to raise rating from 7 to 8.

So many plays and I haven't rated it yet! The rating is based on many plays over a short period of time, so maybe it'll change.

I really like this game. It's abstract, and with an appealing theme (for me). I love the fact that you set your own Victory Requirement. There are only 2 random things: map setup and which gods will not enter play. Not 1 game is the same. You may have a certain strategy, but somehow you can't do the same in every game.

Obviously, this is a game to play often and learn to get better. It's very tactical. If you decide to hamper your opponent, you will hamper yourself as well. But you have to try to make your choice less hampering for you than your opponent (the same goes for moves that'll help you further).

I don't like bidding, but the bidding for turn order in this game clocked with me. You always have to bid 1 cattle more, but everything you bid is divided over all the players. It makes you think twice before committing a certain amount of cattle to your opponent. In fact: this bidding part is my favourite part of the game. :)

The abstract nature makes it a little hard to understand at first, but the gameplay becomes smooth after a few turns. Its beautiful and thematic. Its basically just a simple pick up and deliver, but I really do see the abstract theme here. The mechanic of increasing the points you need for victory makes you think about what combinations of gods and 'technology' you want for your 'engine.' I love it it a little more after every play.

Playtime is shorter than the listed 2.5 hours and the weight is definitely lower than 3.7.  The rules are straightforward other than some initial confusion about using hubs and secondary craftsmen.  I am hoping that after several more plays the relative value of each god/specialist (depending on the random setup) will become an intriguing factor.

Update: 9 plays now. Good, solid game. Varying combinations of gods+craftsmen win.

Update: second play Eshu won. Still no secondary craftsmen in play. Enough to explore next time. Not a very heavy game. Enjoyable, but also quite one-dimensional. Basically just one way to score points: upgrade your monuments.

First two player learning game I won with the fertility god plus the herd specialist. We got used to the mechanisms, it all seemed to work. With the fertility god I took away all the need for bidding high. All finished in an hour. The different combo's of god+specialist and the variable board make for a different game each time. Seemed like building craftsmen is costly, while your opponent can use them immediately. Need to play more, rating will be adjusted. Interesting game, which probably gets much more interesting with more players.

A real splotter that plays in (less than) 2 hours and doesn't have a shitload of chits. Winner. Definitely worth the investment for me. On the same level as Indonesia, Roads & Boats, Antiquity, but in half the playing time, so I actually manage to get this one on the table. It even plays great with 2 (in about 90 minutes max). Scales pretty good.

RATING: 9
The Great Zimbabwe is an interwoven and opaque game where you are given plenty of levers that have no labels - some lead to your immediate demise and others can propel you to victory, then you are told to figure it out. 

There is an auction, wherein players pay money to each other in order to chose their place in the turn order, There is a tiered system of craftsmen that can be built and utilised by all players (at a cost, set by the owning player). There is a board which adds a layer of spatial considerations to it all (and players can and will attempt to wreck each others positions through cunning placements). Then, to add further texture to the system, players can also take on special powers unique to them. And despite this the game is spartan, nothing is really superfluous, what you see is what you get - the rules are straightforward, not heavy on the intricacies. 

The resulting game is a negotiation in move and countermove with tensions steadily rising as players try to navigate the intricacies they’ve made for themselves. Money sloshes around in ever increasing amounts as more money is introduced to the increasingly volatile economy (a mere trickle at first, then more and more) - before ultimately culminating in a final turn where it all collapses into a win for the player that timed his or her position to coincide with the flow of money enough to drag themselves across the finish line. And while some would say the requisite arithmetic to playing well makes for a rather “dry” game I don't mind it at all, and calculating the cost of every upgrade for all players and their current “time to win” is required lest you throw the game away by not seeing the need to shake things up before the win becomes inevitable.

When playing there is a heavy emphasis in denial, to cut your opponents at the knees instead of focusing on your own acceleration or growth - the focus is on pulling your opponents under then standing on their heads so they drown while you stay above water, which is what I want from a game. I also love this game for its variability and the way the game-space collapses over time as players invest in their positions and you get to see just where the butterflies land.

My verdict: Slightly difficult to get to the table but an absolute masterpiece, works well for the entire player count range. Demands that players are invested lest they throw the game.

Very good. I like the way the game economy works. At first, you're very constricted by the cattle you have, then the board starts to become a constriction and turn order becomes more important. I also like the VR system. All in all rather clever game, and the best game Splotter have done by a fairly large margin.

Cool Leonard Cohen reference in the rules.

Enthusiastic.

I like the comment about this combining the best aspects of Brass (logistical challenge) with Dominion (up-front strategic response to variable setup). Initial play was mind-bending, and the second was confounding as I was trying and failing to explain the rules. Third play years later was basically like starting over, and I can't tell whether this was brilliant or just obtuse. I'm going to trust other comments saying this gets better with more plays and keep the high rating. Besides, it earns the benefit of the doubt for packing so much into a relatively quick playing time.

I enjoyed this considerably less than Food Chain Magnate, the first Splotter game I played. I think my biggest problem here was that the simplicity of the game didn't really match the time commitment needed to play. This is like a really simplified route-building game, but turns are very restrictive on what you can do, and the engine building that goes on feels kind of shoehorned in to fit the Splotter style. I think I would have enjoyed this game more had it clocked in at under an hour, but it far outstays its welcome. I thought the game was fine, but I don't really see any reason to return to it. Brass does the same thing in a much more compelling way.

Need another game to better define my opinion. The game seems very little intuitive and totally fiddly. Cannot see many replayability. In the good side, I loved the combos god/specialist, but some seems to powerful. The variable end game condition is a great idea. Only more plays will say what I really think about the game, but in my table 2 players want the game to end. That does not seem a good sign. Rating may rise or fall down.

Splotter was something I associated to a very fine but very rare wine - something all connoisseurs know about but have never tried. But thanks to recent reprints they have become available, although at a high price. So do they deliver?

Yes, their reputation for designing deep and interactive games is certainly proven in this game about trade and monument building in Southern Africa. There are many interesting and double-edged decisions here. You bid for turn order but the more you bid, the more do those who can't afford the bidding get and help them catch up. You can choose Gods and specialists to get access to certain abilities but it also raises your victory conditions. You need resources to build your monument but those resources can only get there through a long and interactive chain.

1. You need a technology to build a craftsman (something that raises the victory conditions).
2. The craftsmen need resources within range (something that is limited each round).
3. The resources need to be transported to your monument (possibly through several steps if the craftsmen also need resources).
4. The craftsmen need to get paid with a price set by the players themselves (and than can be paid to an opponent if necessary).

The result is a very complex web of interdependencies where the players sometimes try to lure the opponents to purchase resources to finance their own monuments and sometimes try to block the opponents' access to resources to complete their own monuments first. One example of the latter is to build a mask craftsman who needs wood as a resource and thus lower the value of wood so that it can't be used to build monuments. Add the game value the beautiful illustrations based on authentic African art and you have a game well worth the money!

Finally I can't help quoting my geek buddy Cymric: "It is at this point that I even begin to wonder how in blazes someone manages to design something like The Great Zimbabwe. It is hard to believe that something as tightly woven as this game arises by chance, but at the same time the amount of play testing by genuinely shrewd and capable players necessary to evolve it into being makes me want to howl."

RATING: 7
In ancient Africa,one is competing to raise the greatest monuments. On your turn, you may take a God, take a specialist, erect a monumnet, raise the level of a monument or construct a craftsman. You may only have one God the whole game. Craftsman supply goods to upgrade monuments, but people can buld seconary craftsman to make that a primary good.  To upgrade a monument you have to be able to trace supply to craftsman.

The complexity arises in trying to trace supply from your monuments and is not intuitive after reading the rules, but requires some experience through game play. It's okay, but there is a lot of analysis to trace to your monuments, particularly as the game starts winding down and people have lots of cattle to spend.  It's an expensive game to buy,  and though I didn't buy it, I would recommend a try before you buy to see if it is your type of game. After a  couple of plays, it works, but it doesn't excite me like other good games.

This game was uninspiring in almost every way. It boils down to stacking discs on top of each other, and contains unfulfilling complexity. There's basically no excitement in this game. There were some wacky design decisions, like forcing a player to burn a turn just to change his prices. That is inexplicable. And restricting price changes to upward only is papering over a different problem by creating a new one. It appears that the real game is simply to have enough money built up to out-bid everybody else for turn order on the turn that will, quite clearly, be the last turn.

RATING: 10
The first time I played this game I was so disappointed. It seemed a stupid game, especially too fast, so that eventually what seemed to matter was some clever tactical moves more than anything else.

Then I played it more. And more. And the more I play it the more I like it. It happens the opposite of what happens with other games. Usually the more we play a game the less we like it. Not with this game. It needs to be played a lot to show its greatness.

There is another effect, related to the above: normally a game is difficult to play at the beginning, and easier to play after a while, because we start to know strategies and we start to use the auto-pilot (and also often start being bored by it). Not with this game. It has the strange feature to become harder to play the more we play it, because only when some subtle things become evident further depths are shown and deeper and more interesting thinking becomes necessary.

So I am afraid the reason the game is not reaching the greater rating that it deserves here on BGG is that people may stop playing after too few games (because I think the first games are really not exciting and seem to be only some tactical puzzle-like affair). Even 5 or more games can be two few to really appreciate it. But if one is patient and goes on trying, they will be repaid with  wonderful game experiences.

I like the way the map is built randomly each game and at the same time the total absence of luck or of hidden information. It scales well. It is highly interactive and   each game is tense. The different powers acquired through gods and specialists require a totally different approach to the game, further increasing the huge replayability. The rules are very elegant and simple, the game is hard to play well. 

So a very good game for my taste. The only reason it doesn't get a 10 from me is that I prefer highly strategical games, instead in this one the tactical aspect is maybe a bit too important. I prefer the wider horizon, games in which one wins for the big plan and the creative long term choices more than for the puzzle-like tactical moves. But it is just a bit more tactical than what I like, there is a lot of strategy too, and the more I play the more the depth in strategy is coming to the surface, so it is not impossible that my rating will go up with further plays.

Try this game, in any case. It is well worth the price. It is original and beautiful in a way that is like a landmark for Splotter Games.

UPDATE March 2013
After playing the game more I raised the rating to ten. A beautiful experience packed in such a short time and with such simple rules. And each game is completely different from the other. It is really a gem, what a shame that it does not have the success it deserves because it needs time to be appreciated.

The different aspects of the game don't seem to be stitched together into a unified whole perfectly, but it's worth playing.  Maybe a bit heavier than it needs to be; the strategy options are many, but the decisions are less interesting than they seem at first.   Seems clunky and time consuming, although it is unique.  Might have balance issues.

Tough game, not sure we grokked it. Even after playing, we were scratching our heads thinking of how one could possibly beat the strategy of taking a -2 VR and then building a new monument each turn, opportunistically raising when possible, while others had to increase their VR to build craftsmen. (Not sure the motivation to build craftsmen is that high) I came to the gut conclusion that the quality of strategy is very much about playing the other players, much like Puerto Rico or Container. The game had a dry quality to it, and it was also difficult to calculate the cost and how to logistically perform the raising of monuments after a certain point.

There is a lot of depth and variability in this game. The gods break the rules in a variety of ways. It will take quite a few plays to scratch the surface. The rules are relatively simple. The difficulty of the board play comes from figuring out the possibilities of connections of craftsmen resources and monuments. Cash and turn order is crucial at the endgame, because players early in turn order will quickly gobble up resources for upgrades, that may win the game. Foreseeing the endgame and preparing for it with turn order positioning, collecting money, and appropriate board play, is not easy.

Edit: After 3 games rating goes down to 4.


Rating after two games.
Very hard to rate it. The first game was great - every aspect of the game works nice, quite short lenght of play, zero downtime - nice. Second play was TERRIBLE. When producers made prices for goods too high (and even worse: made better goods too fast) the game almost stops! No one earns anything because producers can't lower prices. In that case, the game wins a player who build the most monuments. And that was extremelly boring... 
I'll give it another go. Maybe that was a problem of that one game (almost all players were novice). But now I can only give it a rating of 5.5 (first game 8, second game 3)

Gioco complesso, soprattutto dal punto di vista strategico, con forte interazione. Il gioco si presta a diverse strategie ed è un titolo da provare e riprovare per entrare con maggiore consapevolezza nei meccanismi. Tipico gioco dove le partite iniziano veloci e frizzanti per poi incagliarsi nel finale causando tempi morti durante le lunghe fasi-azione degli avversari. Peccato per il prezzo elevato rapportato ai materiali, ma siamo di fronte a scelte editoriali... (discutibili).

Classic example of a game that sounds quite convoluted when reading the rules/explaining it, but that is actually very straightforward to play. Well worth that initial investment in both pennies and time, after a few turns it clicks and the speed picks up nicely.
Reminds me a little of Power Grid in that the end of the game can suddenly appear from nowhere if you don't keep an eye out...

Very excited about this. A tough strategy game which plays in a reasonable time and, with the various gods, specialists and random board appears to offer tremendous replayability. As long as no one strategy turns out to be dominant I can't see the rating falling. Sold only because I couldn't see it getting more plays in the foreseeable future.

Won lottery, so I had money to burn in an impulse purchase. Otherwise, would never consider paying $130 for a Boardgame. Big mistake. Almost complete abstract, way too fiddly and non intuitive. Drier than the desert it takes place in. Distance rules, hubs, shitty looking cards, stare at board for an hour trying to math out routes...ugh. Warched a playthrough video and lost interest 20 minutes in. Looks like a five year old drew the map. $130?? This company is a cosmic joke. Don't get the splotter love. And this is supposed to be one of the easy ones. Hopefully, I can sell it.

A very original mechanic. You build up your tower by using resources but they are shared and the more you control and get paid for, the more points you need to win. So you must balance creating resources and getting bonus cards since the more you have the more points you need to win.

After ten plays in 4 months, I'm increasing my rating of this game from a 9 to a 10. This game is absolutely phenomenal. 

Every time I play, I follow a very different strategy, and so far, I've found many different paths that could easily lead to victory if applied right. Much like all Splotter games, the ruleset is so simple, and yet there is depth beyond belief. It's basically a notch or two away from Go in terms of simplicity vs depth. 

One caveat I will mention is that I think the game is at its absolute best at 3-4 players. Two is a bit too zero-sum for my tastes, and five gets a little unpredictable. That said, I would still gladly play at any player count. If I had to put them in order of preference, I think it would be 3 > 4 > 2 > 5.

As far as abstractish types of games go this is one of the best. Absolutely brilliant and may well have some upside too! 3/9/15

Update: on reflection I think turn order is too important in this game and it will generally come down to who goes first on the last turn wins. Seems as though every Splotter game has a serious flaw. See FCM

RATING: 8
The Great Zimbabwe is a hard game to describe.  Each turn, players bid on turn order (which is crucial) as well as game-breaking special abilities (which come with severe victory condition penalties).  Players then buy and place factories on a grid map, and try to use those factories (both yours and your opponents') to deliver goods to build up monuments.  However, a lot of the stuff on the board can only be used once per turn, which is why turn order is so important.  As the game progresses, players need to get a number of different goods to upgrade their monuments, including advanced goods that require factories to work together.  The result is a incredibly cerebral game that really forces players to make value calculations at every point.

Playtime: ~20 minutes per player 

Comment: Fun game with a lot of variability. Looks like it will be more fun with more players. Also, the bidding at the beginning of the round is awesome. Very well done. Components are a bit flimsy though but they look nice. Player aid sheets should be on a thicker card stock. The game plays quickly for being so heavy. Interesting combination of time/weight.

Update: Holy crap is this game insane with 5. Not bad per se, but having 3 new players in the game really messed with the prices of goods and made it slow to a crawl at the beginning. I think it would be fun with 5 experienced players though. Actually, I think this game would be more fun with experienced players in general. This game seems very easy to break if people are just throwing out random prices for goods and buying the secondary craftsman "just because". Reminded me of Puerto Rico when you have new players just doing whatever and are helping out the experienced players inadvertently. 

I need more plays of this to determine if the rating will increase or decrease. I like it right now and I think I'll love it when I play it more. Right now though it could go either way.

RATING: 9
In our first play we messed up the rules pretty badly (didn't remove the used markers at the end of the turn) and the game lasted 4 hours. Fortunately, the second play was much better. 

This is a hard game to grasp in early games. The consequences your actions aren't clear, so it's difficult to come up with a plan. Thing improve drastically with experience though and by the second play the richness and depth of the game reveal themselves. There are a lot of very interesting things to ponder every single turn related to resource allocation, board positioning and timing.  

By the third play (the point where I'm at right now) you understand that this is a game about acceleration. It's like a formula one race where the winner is the first guy to reach the first turn of the first lap. It's frustrating in a sense because you can see the rest of the track ahead, you know how hard you worked to reach your current speed and all that work will be wasted because the race just ended. Also, that means that there's not a lot of space to come back from early mistakes. My guess would be that in games among experienced players the winner will become clear before the game officially ends. But that doesn't mean the game's scripted. Far from it: the random selection of gods and terrain is more than enough to ensure variability.

And it's a great enjoyable experience. Right now it feels like one of Splotter's best releases.

I discovered Splotter Spellen at Essen, where they have a whitebox-game every year that sells very well, even sells out most of the time, but also is very expensive. Some of there games have became legend and if you want a 'Roads & Boats' for instance, you'll have to be willing to pay really a lot of money to get a copy.

There 'The Great Zimbabwe' got some great comments, but paying more then 70 euro from a company and a designerduo I hadn't play a single game before, that was a bridge too far for me. So when I was able to buy one at acceptable retailerprice, I didn't doubt for a moment and got myself a copy and played it yesterday (13/04/2013).

I was the one who read the rules. It was only 8 pages, something I'm gratefull for, after reading rulebooks as 'Space Cadets' or 'Android: Netrunner' before :s But after reading the rules I couldn't grasp the game. That is because this is a very mechanic game. This is in fact a pure abstract, with zero feeling of theme and are a bunch of mechanics who are glued together. Some of them are really nice, I in particular liked the 'drop-out bidding and divide cattle - mechanism' and the whole idea of taking powerfull cards will increase you VR (= how much points you have to score before your score becomes positive). 
The whole 'hub'-thing however is very hard to grasp and would have suited much better in a space-theme then in an African Kingdom. This is also what makes this game very, very abstract as all intuition disappears with that.

So the gameplay itself. It was surprisingly short (85 minutes with 3 all new players). That's probably also due to the fact that I made the big mistake of putting a Diamond craftsman on the map (I had a good cattle engine thanks to 'The Heard') too early, giving the others the opportunity to built level 5 of there monuments and to finish the game, while I still had a big gap to close on my VR, who was very high. 
I like games where I can play most of the times on intuition and where a look at the boards gives me a good 'feeling' of the situation. The Great Zimbabwe is just the opposite of that. You have to do math all the time and make sure every single cattle is taken into account and looking at the gameboard is far from obvious as the hub-system makes that things can be reached in a very unnatural, totaly not logic way. Therefore this will never be my favorite game, but I can imagine that players who like to calculate every move they make (and even those from others), will become very wet from this game.

On a final notice: there is some wood in this game, but imho you don't get good value for your big money. The playersheets are very, very flimsy, which I personally would find a bit harsh if you have payed 70 euro or more for a game. So this game didn't convince me to pay the money Splotter is asking for there games, but I can see why others would do that.

I was fortunate enough to play the Great Zimbabwe (GZ) at Lobster Trap 2012. We decided to play a beginner game that did not include the full compliment of gods nor any of the specialists. At first glance I could see very familiar traits taken from [thing=19777][/thing]. Similar to games such as [thing=26990][/thing], GZ felt like one of those endeavors where all players have to understand the bureaucracy of the game for the system to function correctly. The bureaucracy of the game felt easy enough to break down if everyone participating did not have a full understanding of the system. I enjoyed the increasing end game victory point goals that made players  balance immediate gains against winning. The ability to only choose one god for the entire game is compelling. I was constantly contemplating whether to snatch up a god quickly or to wait until one best matched my strategy. My least favorite part of the game was calculating all of the delivery costs which felt cumbersome and unrefined. With multiple plays I could see the appeal of this game increasing however there are some significant physical design flaws that I found to be extremely detracting. The card design is atrocious. The tile sizes for the craftsmen felt counter-intuitive. I would like to play GZ again with other players familiar with the system to get an actual feel for the full game.

Right from the start, let's just be clear that the rulebook is written very badly. It suffers from using a lot of game specific terms and then not clearly defining those terms in a way that's easy to find and understand. The game itself is very enjoyable however. The idea is players are building towers of disks on the map. To do so, they need to collect sets of all different goods by using any player's craftsmen on the board thereby depleting the available resources near those craftsmen. When you use an opponent's craftsmen, you have to pay them, which is money that player will get at the start of the next round. One of the most interesting things about this game, is as you build craftsmen or take cards, the number of points you need to win goes up, so you simultaneously advantage and disadvantage yourself at the same time. This is a deep game that rewards multiple plays.

Simple set-up and short play time (2P).  The cards that are picked determine how the players will execute their moves.  I love the concept of a moving victory point requirement.  The more cards you take, the more you can do in the game, and your victory point requirement will increase.

Great, great game. The interaction between the Gods and the different setup make it one of the most unique eurogames out there.

This game is alright. The good part is that there are plenty of tough decisions and thinky moments in the game, all with plenty of player interaction. The issue for me is that most of the game though is spent just determining what moves are even possible, not on evaluating what moves you should actually take. It's very difficult to figure out the exact price and possibility for building your own monuments, especially as the 2nd stage craftsmen come on to the board. You have to check prices of several players, evaluate if you can ship the resources and goods around. Only after you've analyzed all of this and figured out the price can you begin to evaluate if you'd like to make that move compared to another. 

And so to me that is a major weakness of the game. Most of the time is spent just determining what can be done and how much it would cost, instead of spending time debating what move would be best for you. It gets even harder if you want to figure out what your opponents can or should be doing. For all these reasons I'm not really wanting to play this again. There are far too many truly brilliant games out there where you can quickly evaluate yours and others options, and can focus on the interesting bit--figuring out what is best among those choices.

Mechanically interesting game with big early decisions (which god to take, if any). However, the resulting game is too abstract for my taste, suffers from heavy AP (despite not really being computable), and the bidding system for turn order can break down near the end if wealthy players compete for their chance to expand tons of monuments before others.

I dig it. A lot of game in a relatively short time, especially for a Splotter. Variable map layouts make each game different. Setting prices on craftsmen and only being able to raise and not lower those prices can make for interesting market effects. Gods and specialists give a wide range of choices in customizing your abilities, and the VR adjustments having people go for different targets feels clever. A lot to explore in Zimbabwe.

First impressions after one play: Very interesting mechanics, which need some time to sink in (at least for me). Towards the end the playing speed slows quite a bit since everybody is trying to find the optimal move which is not so obvious and there is the risk that someone miscalculated and needs to roll back his move. Despide this I still would like to play again.

Game turns are fairly simple. How the options on your turns meld together is not.

I like this one, but I deduct for the following:
1 point for board fiddleliness. Too much clean up after everyone has taken their actions.

1point for rich-get-richer. We all felt that those who had built a base early kept reaping rewards throughout the game.

1 point for AP. Really no way to plan out your turn deep into the game until you see what the other players do first in turn order.

Your mileage may vary. So also, may mine.

In The Great Zimbabwe you raise monuments in ancient Africa to impress the gods. For this you build an economy of craftsment, who produce ritual goods to sacrifice to the gods.

TGZ is the best economic board game for me. I become a bit tired of Euro games, which are just conversions of cubes/ressources into victory points, but do not have a real economy, i.e. a market and market prices for goods. TGZ on the other hand is an (almost) closed economy and you set the prices for the goods your craftsmen produce. You decide: Set low prices and attract other players buy your goods (and making the game fast) or corner the market and inflate prices (and maybe stalling the game).

Besides the economy, TGZ offers one more of my favourite mechanisms: spacial reasoning. You have to plan transport routes and position your monuments accordingly. Since the board is built from modular elements, the map is different every game offering a lot of replayability.

During the game you decide to which god you want to worship. This grants you special abilities, which heavily influence the game. There are some gods, you have to react to or the corresponding player can easily steal in a win. I have now tried quite a variety of the gods and up to now they all seem to be very balanced (there is the clever mechanism that the more powerful a god is, the more victory points are needed for a win).

In the end game the turn order auction is very crucial and it can be a bit mathy to calculate the costs needed to raise your monuments. For my taste there is a bit too much down-time with 5 players, but I had a lot of fun with all player counts from 2 to 4 (and for every player count TGZ feels a bit different). 

In total TGZ is much more interactive than most current Euro games and offers a really unique gaming experience.

Update: After 15 plays this game still surprises me, since I still do not have the feeling to have really understood it. I think I knew the timing of when to bring 2nd tier craftsmen and when to raise prices, but again a player with less experience could snatch a win easily with me being out of competition.

I guess it's a good thing when a game is really expensive and you play a friend's copy and you don't like it.  Right?

Such an odd game. Loved it at first play but then started to get a little bored with it. But it is one of my gf's favorites so I have played it more and am starting to love it again.

RATING: 8.2
[u]The Positive[/u]
(+) Mechanic-wise this game really pushes some exciting buttons and pulls some original levers. The turn order bidding has been executed cleverly in a way I haven't seen implemented in other games (cattle (= money) which gets put into the bid gets redistributed between all players). Players can affiliate once but for the entire game with one of a wide variety of gods allowing for a simple player power which alters your personal play dramatically, supporting your personal strategy. The winning condition is basically a point cap players race towards, but this cap depends on how powerful players have become - allowing a realistic perspective for victory for both players who invested in powerful upgrades as well as simple leachers. The game sure feels different from the other boxes laying around in your game collection.

(+) The game offers a good balance between strategic and tactical play. [u]Strategic options include[/u]: setting up long term plans as how many monuments a player should build in order not to lose too many actions but have enough flexibility, which god (special player power) to choose (you only get 1 pick in the entire game: do you go for it immediately, or wait a little to see how the game turns out?), how to set yourself up to attract enough cattle (money), to think about how a drastic change you plan to implement on the map will hurt others more than you in the long run, ...
[u]Tactical options include:[/u] knowing when the time has come to bid ambitiously or hold back from turn order bidding, suddenly increasing the complexity of the logistic puzzle and prices for opponents who are advancing too fast, the use of special 'specialist actions' to alter the board in such a way so you can pull off that impossible move, ... To me, a masterful balance between strategic and tactical play makes for an interesting play experience, keeps players involved and is what makes a great game stand out from the merely 'good' games.

(+) The rule set for this game is very limited (rules only take up about 6-7 pages or so and are summerized on player aids in only a few lines really) and feel rather intuitive. This makes teaching and learning the game quite easy. Despite the game being obviously deep and brainy, it doesn't take too long to play this game. First time players will probably finish a game in under 30 minutes/players, which is remarkable for a game that offers this kind of strategic and tactical wealth.

(+) The set-up of each game will be totally different: the way the map gets built and water areas do or do not get connected or certain resources are clustered or get distributed across Africa: it all makes for a totally different experience in which different strategies will benefit or get challenged. Next to a varying map set-up, different gods will be available each game, allowing for new ways to plan your game. This will ensure no game plays the same as one before and the game should have a high replay value.

(+) Player-interaction-wise, there is a great dynamic going on here! This game can be pretty cut-throat as players are in fierce direct competition on the (small) map with limited resources. The game offers plenty of opportunity to dramatically alter the game of your opponents, but in the same time all players are in for this togheter and direly need each others infrastructure in order to reach their goals. This tension between trying to choke each other to death but also needing each other makes for some interesting gameplay situations (and some interesting conversation around the gaming table ;) )
 
(+) Related to interesting inter-playing dynamic: The game engine runs on a semi-closed economy in which only very limited money flows out towards the bank (when players place craftsmen 'villages' on the map), and more money comes leaking in from the bank as revenues and some limited special (god/specialist) actions. Most of the time money goes around between the players when they buy each others stuff. This way the game grows: the economy in the game starts very small but builds up significantly in consecutive turns, but it will be the player who laid the best plans for gathering money who will benefit from this the most.

[u]The Negative:[/u]
(-) For a game in this price range (about € 80), one could expect some better quality components nowadays. The amount of 'silver' cattle (equals 1 money) provided is pretty limited imposing frequent fiddly money exchanges. The cardboard is pretty thin, the player aids are paper in stead of cardboard, the game comes with one lousy plastic bag to store a ton of components and cards ... Pretty miserable for such a production. On the bright side: I like the artwork on the cards, I like the clear and distinct and yet thematic graphical design of the game and apart from one minor annoyance on the player aids (which don't mention prices can be adapted when a new craftsmen get placed), they are very clear and easy to use.

(-) The game involves a lot of calculus when players are counting the amount of cattle they need to collect the necessary resources to increase their monuments (the main mechanic in order to score points). The logistic puzzle gets complicated quickly with suppliers, co-suppliers, limited resources, costly hubbing to cross greater distances, etc. You will spend a great deal of game time counting and recounting, and if this is not your thing, you should steer clear!

(-) This game can be a bit punishing to players who made a big mistake along the way. Overbidding for turn order in mid-game might break your chances of winning and mean you will need to sit this one out without much perspective, especially when you have no flexibility left in terms of selecting a god to help you out of this mess... On the other hand, this also means that the game rewards clever play without cheap 'catch-up mechanisms'. Note that the game *does* offer opportunities in mid-game to turn the game around for players lagging a little behind - just make sure not to wait too long to set such plans into motion when they become necessary and don't lag behind too critically ;)

(-) My biggest problem with this game is this: as brilliant as this game plays, the end game is often very anticlimactic. When at least one player reaches his/her point cap, the game ends after that round. This means that in 80% of the cases, the game ends when a player scores a ton of points with an 'grow monuments' action, reaching his/her points cap. At the end of the game resources will have become so scarce (due to players having complicated supply chain, the amount of monuments built, high prices, ...) that player order in the final round is often the only mechanic directing victory. If you are in the running to win, you need to go very early in the final round or you will see your scoring potential ruined by an opponent eating away the resources you need in order to grow your monuments. It is a shame that a game that plays so interestingly with such a cool dynamic tends to get decided with a simple bidding mechanism in the end. In practice this also means in the end, victory often gets decided between potential winners by a simple bidding mechanism for turn order. Ending up with the most brilliant plan but one cattle less than an opponent might cost you the game due to simple turn order bidding. What's more, the end game score will not reflect a 'fair' image of the 'achievements' of all players. Being unable to grow your monuments in the last round because you are one lousy cattle short to participate in turn order bidding could cost you a tremendous amount of points and turn an almost sure victory into a sour defeat ending in 3rd or 4th place. Of course, only those who played cleverly will be amongst the potential winners in the final round and will be involved in the fierce final round turn order bid - in this way the game certainly rewards clever play, but it still is a pretty aclimactic way to lose or win the game in the end. Beware: not all games end in this situation in which turn order decides everything: there are certain gods/player powers that aid players to collect resources even when they are behind in turn order, but obviously this is very situational. When getting this adventure on the table, chances are always pretty big that the winner in the end will be decided by simple turn order bidding, so make sure you have a considerable surplus of cattle in the end.

[u]Conclusion:[/u]
With 'The Great Zimbabwe', Splotter has released a game with that typical 'Splotter'-feel: the whole thing bathes in that interesting inter-player dynamic of distinct postive and negative player interaction, creating very interesting game situations. With a good balance between tactical and strategic play, the game offers a deep and interesting play experience with a simple set of rules and a very reasonable game time. The mechanics are very original and cleverly designed, which makes the game stand out from the rest. The game revolves around logistics and price-setting on a map, which gives TGZ sometimes a bit of a similar feel compared to Splotters most recent title: 'Food Chain Magnates' - however, except for the logistic puzzle and doing quite some calculus to see what potential you can attract to your infrastructure, there are other mechanics at work in both games. Both games sometimes feel a little similar, but TGZ sure is the shorter of the two and is in my opinion a little less cut-throat (there is no risk of bankruptcy here!). Component-wise the game doesn't really offer bang for your buck with pretty lousy components compared to the high sales prices but the components are well designed and functional. You should stay away if you don't like to spend your game time doing a lot of counting (in that regard this game is far worse than something like 'power grid'!) and would be turned off by the fact that often the end game situation will be decided in turn order bidding between potential winners. Of course, in order to become a potential winner in this game, you will have to masterfully navigate yourself throughout this huge playground of wonderful opportunities and dangerous pitfalls which in itself already provides a great game experience, which - thanks to variable set-ups - will probably keep you coming back for more.

[u]Tips for those going in:[/u]
(*) At the start of each game, think about how you will try to collect enough cattle. If you fall behind in this regard, opponents can hurt you badly in turn order bidding and by increasing distance of goods or prices. Acquire cattle in the following ways: monopolize a certain type of good (in such a way that opponents buy from you), het herd-specialist who allows for your cattle to breed, grow your monuments at the right time (when prices are low) to increase your income or affiliate with certain gods (many possibilities here: go for a straight increase of income, go for gods that lower prices you have to pay for goods or go for it indirectly by gods who allow you to use spent resources so you don't have to spend much cattle on turn order bidding any longer).

(*) The gods are very powerfull, but it is imperative to affiliate with the god that matches your strategy [b]and[/b] the game situation. By committing yourself too early, opponents can react and adapt their game so that your personal benefit might shine less bright. Commit yourself too late, and you will deny yourself the opportunity of some great player powers. Some gods should be taken early, but some can wait - if you have set your mind on such a god, be strong and resist the temptation of taking him too early to allow yourself some flexibility in the mid-game

(*) Turn order can be extremely important, depending on what action you plan to take. Growing your monuments can require lots of resources, and in such instances it is very important to go early that round. Don't be cheap on such instances, but hold back while turn order bidding goes on for rounds in which turn order is less important for you. Beware that turn order is often a deciding factor for victory in the final round: you will probably need a lot of cattle by then!

(*) Often hopeless situations in the mid-game with opponents getting more cattle and getting their monuments up cheaply with you lagging behind can be turned around drastically by investing in 2 new secondary craftsmen. It is often worth the rise is victory requirement (points cap) in order to be able to increase the logistical difficulty for your opponents, buying you much needed time to get your game together again and increasing your income along the way. It doesn't hurt if you place the secondary craftsmen in such a way that they are closer to your monuments than the monuments of your opponents obviously. Also take that opportunity to increase the prices of your craftsmen!

(*) There is a serious supply / demand mechanic going on in this game: don't waste your time and cattle increasing supply by additional craftsmen when there is not sufficient demand for goods early in game when monuments are still small. If there is sufficient supply with low prices, profit by investing in your monuments.

(*) In the first round: if you play early, it is worth taking a close look to the map to see if you can place a craftsman strategically so that he dominates a big part of the resources on the map. If you play late in turn order, use what your opponents have built: if there is a wealth of resources, be opportunistic and use competition between craftsmen and low prices to invest in your monuments (build additional monuments and later grow them to increase your income and points easily).

(*) Diamond cutter craftsmen are very expensive, but they don't run the risk of opponents complicating their logistics and they are probably the only craftsmen who can play a significant role in scoring direct victory points.
 
(*) As a rule of thumb, a game will probably not last 10 rounds. Get your cattle collecting and point scoring engines up quickly, and don't wait too long to turn hopeless situations around!

Really disappointed with this one.
Good ideas (biding system, scoring solution, way to get goods…) in a burn brain concept.
But it’s boring! 
And, every person that buys the game deserves more respect. I accept the price as a marketing strategy, but I can’t accept the inferior quality of materials (the boards are so small!, the temples are… discs!, and so on, urg!)…

I am slowly realizing this game is far more about mitigating and exploiting your opponents turn order and actions rather than necessarily always maximizing your own. One look at the mainstream eurogames of today and you will see that this philosophy is almost the antithesis of theirs, and that is what allows TGZ to stand heads and shoulders above them. The experience really shines when everyone at the table knows to play in this manner.

***
Update on 11/30/2017: I have since seized a coveted (by myself, at least) "Xango" win, and a "Tsui-Goab" victory. The latter was with inexperienced opponents, so it was a bit of a snowball, but the former was against one of my greatest competitors and felt very rewarding. I am slowly learning the value of gradual movements, to allow my opponents to create opportunities for myself, and finding better timing to seize turn order. One of the best aspects this game offers is that these dynamics will vary play-to-play, and group-to-group. It feels especially like walking a proverbial tight-rope when against proficient players, but that just makes the play experience that much more enjoyable. Astounding design.

***
Update on 10/19/2017: More plays, more learning, more losses. The margin of error between making a move that favors you, versus one that hurts you, can be rather slim. In the most opaque scenarios, this requires substantial foresight (of which I seem to lack). My aggressive play-style does not seem to cut it, and as a result, and I have yet to emulate a suitable balancing act required to maintain the lead and close the game. Snowballing to victory is nigh impossible when playing with alert opponents. Alas, I keep realizing I still do not know how to -play- this game. TGZ, you are a wonderful yet cruel mistress.

Comments:
I do not rate The Great Zimbabwe a "10" to say it is a flawless game, but it certainly feels close to one. No other board game I have played has enchanted me as much as this title. I suspect none ever will, for a very long time. As such, I choose to rate it a 10 because, by my tastes, it deserves a place in an echelon of its own: a rank where I actually struggle to pinpoint significant faults that detract from the play experience. I believe this is a game that every hobby board gamer *must* experience at least once, if only to witness the masterful blend of game mechanisms that organically coalesce together. Each facet of the game allows players to seamlessly weave a dynamic and intriguing story by interacting with one another. 

If your first play piques your interest even subtly, I encourage you to give the game the time it deserves. Allow the various challenges it presents to marinate in your mind, in the hope that repeated plays will marvel you, as much as they did to me. I promise that your time will be worth it.

the threes in the rating is for common number throughout the game. Shorter than the big 3 splotter titles, by an hour or two. The board art is very Basic brushstrokes, intentional, but still not my idea of great art. The rest of the pieces have good art, but nothing earth-shattering. Components are nice and thick when need be. Cards have a good feel to them. Overall, components are less attractive, but do work efficiently. I would not suggest that the fields of Zimbabwe look as bland as the tiles are. The wooden cattle are better than more camels :P 

Game play. Unique mechanisms throughout, topped with some stand by mechanisms that work well when needed. It feels at times like a puzzle that you have to figure out each round, because the puzzle changes before your turn comes back around. The bidding reminds me at times of "If wishes were fishes" in a backward way, but does make the choices hard when it comes to what you need to do and when. The Gods and other cards adding to your VP needed to win is really "neat" for a lack of another word, and I suspect other games will borrow the mechanism in future designs.

Still loving it. Still losing, but heck I can't even win my own designs, how can I expect to win a Splotter game, especially against my wife.

Interesting mechanic of increasing one's needed victory points to win when gaining powers to help one win.  As a result, players likely to feel a bit lost during the first game or two as they mentally figure out which powers go well together for the cost.  Mechanically, not all that difficult at all and players will "get it" after a few sample turns. 

Continued plays have been smoother and much tighter games with most (if not everyone) tending to hit their VR on the same turn and wins determined by the overshoot.  A lot of game in a short (90 minute) timeframe.

A game that does not waste any of your time -- very little time spent figuring out what moves are legal, but lots of time pondering their implications.

It's like Food Chain Magnate, but without the fiddly bits, snowballing, rules complexity, or obvious opening plays.

update:  it's not so good with 5.  The game drags, turns take a long time, and it is very hard to plan between turns further lengthening things.  It was much longer than a 4 player game and with less strategic control.  I think I like it best with 3 but 4 is also good.

Rating after one three-player game at BGG.CON 2012.

This was recognizably a Splotter game, but was a bit on the lighter end of what they do.  The logistical elements were there, as were some bits of Antiquity DNA in the way the gods worked.  I found it to be an enjoyable experience and would love to get another look at it to try to learn more about how to be good at it.

Splotter speaks the language of my soul. I don't know what it is about their games. There's no one mechanism I can point to to excite someone, but the way all the mechanisms come together fire up my brain and this one is no different. It's tight, focused, with a lot of room to explore and be creative. It's vicious and tense with a lot of player interaction. It's perfect information. All of these things are what I look for in games and this one has it all in one package. I find Food Chain Magnate takes all of this to an even higher level, which is why I still prefer that one, but the simpler ruleset of this one and quicker turns gives this it's own unique place.

非常斯波特（splotter）的游戏，机制很清奇。版图上有点像reef encounter，而玩起来又有点像Food Chain Magnate。游戏的结束条件非常有趣，你需要自己制定一个目标，然后达到这个目标后触发结束条件，简单的说你拿了很强力的卡或科技，你就比别人更难达到结束条件。
游戏的策略不是很复杂，但节奏感重要。你必须要算清楚每一块钱，算清楚什么时候能触发结束条件才有机会获胜。游戏的前半段比较冗长，后面刷分非常快。值得一试的游戏。

RATING: 7
Very Accessible Complex Euro 

By very accessible, I don't mean cost-wise! Lovely little abstract like euro, reminds me a whole lot of T&E somehow (if you somehow added a mini-economy).

Tight economy, and yes there is excessive counting (only to 3, though!) until you get used to the game, which will take a half-dozen plays. But it plays so short, for a Splotter. Bits are good, as well. Spare, but very evocative. It's not theme-fuelled, but it feels and looks good.

If it's obvious someone's going to win, you're allowed to just call the game! It's ok. Also, yes, the last turn is anti-climactic, because much of the game is preparing to win the last turn's 'first player' auction. Once it's won and you know who's going first (or it's obvious who will be going first), that's pretty much game...but you can play it out if you like.

Very fun game.

Need to play this again before coming to a firm conclusion, but in general there are a lot of excellent bits to this (albeit one of them is a spatial element that I still didn't fully grasp even by the end of the game) and the player-set VP goals is genuinely brilliant, but it isn't clear to me even upon post-game reflection whether the power of winning the last bid and going first is too good.  I can't believe it is or the game wouldn't have been published but I can't immediately see how it is avoided.

This game suffers from the same problem that Container does.  Seemingly small mistakes can have huge impacts on the game result.  For someone who wants to think for 10 minutes before each action I could see this being a great game, especially if everyone at the table is similarly inclined.  Certainly has interesting mechanics, especially the way that the number of victory points needed to win goes up based on which god or craftsman that you take.  While I respect the design of the game, after two plays I have no desire to play again.

Played 1 5P game. There are a lot of interesting concepts which are new to me in The Great Zimbabwe, especially the idea of extending your VP goal by taking on more advantages (specialists and gods). Despite the confusing rules explanation, this isn't that difficult a game to grasp. TGZ is an number-crunching game as players calculate and recalculate how much to bid at auctions, how much to pay for craftsmen and so on. The board becomes messy as the game goes on, so players have to continually scan the board for available resources and spots to place monuments. All this leads to rather slow gameplay, depending on the group you're playing with. I know there are plenty of people who enjoy this type of game, but long economic games aren't really my thing. However, I wouldn't mind playing this again, but probably not with 5 players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Ok, first off, there are some great mechanisms with relation to bidding, turn order, variable victory point conditions and such.

However, the game is one big slog that rewards players with experience. Make a mistake early one and you could effectively be paying for the next three hours and not be in the running to win.

Players are African tribes trying to build up an empire by developing their networks and connecting resources to 'hubs'. If it sounds like a rails game? It is: sans rails. Money is tight and the economy is much determined by how quickly players advance technology (old technology can't be used to upgrade empires and players with access to new tech get paid for its use).

Some clever bits but ultimately fails my 'fun' test. I didn't want to spend 3 hours of my life playing it again.

Early reviews are positive and mention of this game quite interactive with other players in the same way Indonesia.. is a huge plus for me.

Also heard it being compared to container with the setting of price and close economy system.  Overall game I'm most interested in playing right now.

Update: played for the first time.. 7.8 is very tentative rating and most likely to rise with more play.  Everything is there, route building, goods conversion (in a very limited way) with very closed economy.  Seems like it's very hard to catch up when someone is ahead, but journey is quite interesting and looking forward to playing again!  Update: after second play up my rating to 8. Much more enjoyable once you are familiar with the rule. Still hard to play well.  Update to 8.5 after several more play, game changes alot depending on which God is taken, and random set up of the board.  Playing well is quite difficult, timing of building secondary crafts man and also increase of the cost is so hard.  Each game certain God seem to be over powered but then it's not in other situation.  Very opaque game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.9
Fairly complex game of building and using production chains on a board, in which I seem to have seriously upset my neighbour by doing what I assumed to be the best action for myself.

It's fairly hard to see which resource can be reached by which craftsman, and the last rounds started to be really slow with significant downtime while other players moved. Also, planning moves ahead is hard, because each move of the previous players uses up resources that one might have wanted to use. It's not a bad game, but I'm not convinced of it either.

I've played this thing over a hundred times at this point.  While I've cooled a little bit on it, I'm still happy to sit down and play it.  I very much enjoy that it's about your ability to look at the game state and manipulate it through a single action to either upend or stabilize the meta.  It's a mind-blowingly simple system with dozens and dozens of possible plays and counter-plays.

Simple straight-forward design made complicated by overly complex rules.  At its heart it is an abstract pick-up and deliver game with something close to a market.

The design is made exciting by the combination of how you can your special powers.  It certainly has a variety of options that you can explore.  I'm looking forward to seeing how the combos work.

It can drag a bit, but once everyone knows the game, it clips along nicely.

this is an amazing game. it is a very interactive economic, logistics game with a spatial aspect. it reminds me of Brass, but perhaps even more variable. the game is luckless, and has open information. it has a very interesting idea in that when you increase your abilities making yourself more powerful in the game, the VPs you need to win increases! genius! timing is everything in this game.

Very Splotter, supply chain, spatial, subtly interactive. Production amazing - possibly their best. 

its a brain burner and quite abstract. each turn felt a little ground hog day like as you have to rethink your turn based in what the person before did. I think planning will become a little easier with familiarity. It reminds me of Indonesia a little, but much quicker

Opaque game of building monuments in ancient Africa that seems to me like one part Helvetia (chains of workers for advanced resources), one part Container (players carefully set commodity prices), maybe one part Antiquity in the treatment of water... I can see that this approach is getting me nowhere.

It's quite a simple system, with much of the texture provided by unique specialists and gods, claimable by players, which bend the rules for that player only (at a cost). One god extends that player's range to 6 from 3; another lets them re-use resources; another allows double placement of monuments. A good number of the gods have abilities which seem powerful and even game-breaking -- you can imagine what that does to player incentives.

First impressions are that it's difficult enough to play well that without experience it's going to involve a lot of stumbling around in the dark. Correctly pricing commodities is difficult, as is gauging the positional ramifications of monuments and craftsmen -- especially given the complications of hubs, not to mention gods! Reading the effects of your decisions a few turns down the line is very difficult.

I am concerned that it will be too fragile and difficult in the hands of inexperienced players to be worth playing on an infrequent basis. Like all of these games with an incentive management element, understanding the incentives is half of the problem.

Tough one to figure out as a few abstract concepts are rather obtuse. Has layers upon layers, being mechanically complex in certain places (e.g., secondary craftsmen). The escalating VP card play is clever.

Interactive right from the opening turn order bid. Gameplay is both strategic and tactical (I enjoy contemplating the spatial relationships). High replayability by design. I like the theme a lot, too.

Along with the Splotter titles, this is strange game. It's a fascinating study, but really tough for me to wrap my mind around. Doesn't hit the table that often, unfortunately.

Initial 8 rating based mainly on feeling and gut instinct. 

First 2-player learning game ended "too soon" due to newbie inatentiveness - letting the winner get enough resources to raise two monuments in one turn, despite the loser having had the opportunity to deny the win by going first that turn - and despite the winner not actually realising he was about to win.

Mentally demanding resource and route building game. Players need to build links between craftsmen and the resources they require in order to build up monuments, which in turn awards victory points. They game is extremely well balanced and the gods and specialist cards, both of which bring individual powers to the player, ensure that people have to approach the game with differing strategies. There are Splotter Spellen games that does this sort of thing better (think 'Roads and Boats' and 'Aniquity') and part of the struggle with this game is being able to visualise the most efficient routes around the board, which can be more confusing than is strictly necessary, but overall this is a solid effort and rewards strong strategic play.

After myfirst play i was thinking very interesting. In some way similar to Indonesia (pick and deliver feeling), but shorter and more easy. We play with a rule mistake.

The second play (with good rules) was very boring. The prices where to high -> no progress -> no money -> boring. The player who could build 2 monumets in a turn has won.

Why the second game was so bad? Could a to less experience player (like setting the prices to high) breake the game? 

Edit after third play: Too long, boring and uncomfortable (there not so many options, but control what craftsmen has still capacity is for me uncomfortable)

What a mind twister.  Kind of an ugly game, quite abstract, the spatial part of the game is overly convoluted and kind of an esoteric theme but, man, that decision tension!  Two absolutely brilliant things about the game that I absolutely loved:
- you begin seeding your entire strategy for the as early as the bidding for turn order at the start of the first round, and
- gaining benefits and abilities make it so you require more victory points to win.

Will revisit, but hard to as I only know one person with a copy. Giving benefit of the doubt, as our 3-player game was really bad.  Not the fault of the teacher tho, as he had played multiple times before.

Most complaints I'm seeing come from games where the prices were set too high, but our game the prices must have been too low.  In the first 6/7 turns, I had built a tower 5 high, giving me a huge money advantage, because I also had built the only Potter, making my goods invaluable at a price of 2.  But, everyone else had a tower 4 high too.

I had decided that choosing a God early was good idea, so that I could begin reaping the benefits asap.  I chose the God that allows you to use exhausted resources.  The first three turns, this was negligible as another player had taken the god that allows them to pick up extra bidding money.  But, once resources were used for towers, i simply ignored turn order and always built last, never having to worry about it.  This negated the other God's ability.  

Since we all were building tall towers, and never felt the need to expand, i was raking in an income of 5 per turn, I had only built a Potter as well, so after 6/7 turns we all looked at my set up.  Even if everyone raised all their prices to 5 (and upgraded the Potter), there was no way to prevent me from attaining my VP goal by building another 3 level tower.  So, we played the last two turns out, and I won.

Two towers, a potter, and a god.  At the end I was left wondering what the hell went wrong.  And I was pumped beforehand, as this was my first Splotter game experience.  I guess I'm not a fan of the "make a permanent decision" before the game has eve begun mechanic.

Will play again with at least 4.

Pre-ordered. Patiently waiting. :tongue:

AFTER FIRST PLAY, 1/20/13:

Our game went way too fast. We allowed one player to build up a lot of money in the first few rounds while he started several new monuments. Then he blew by us as we naively placed all the resources he needed within reach for him.

Not knowing the game, I'm sure I made amateur mistakes. 

The game is interesting in that it almost feels dichotomous. On one hand you've got an abstract, tactical playing field. On the other hand, you've got these God powers and Specialist abilities that almost add a thematic element of character development.

Darin said it felt more economic than he expected. I decided it felt more tactical than I expected. I guess all this just means that players should not really go into it with many expectations, because it's different enough that it won't play out like anything else most have experienced. Hmmm, when I think of it that way, that's a very good thing. 

I'm going to read through the rules today and see if I can grasp the game ideas a bit better. Perhaps as I know it better I'll discover much more game. I surely think it has that to offer.

My favorite thing about it is the VR mechanic. Kudos to Splotter for that.

Splotter does it again! Wow this game is cool but didn't feel quite as heavy and draining as some of their other titles. I can't wait to give this game a go again. I kept feeling little draws back to Antiquity and found myself smiling. I was loving the innovative new material (especially the variable victory point requirement) being brought to this game and found myself smiling. Damn good game here. Geomorphic boards also make me happy in gaming and guess what? They're here. A big stack of god cards means the game will change from session to session. Have I said this is a damn good game?

Elegant Splotter game. Took me a game to really see the strategies evolve. I did find it kind of boring. Might be better if I try it again.

RATING: 6
With all of the possible combinations of tile position and God selection, this should provide plenty of strategic and tactical variety from game to game. Rich economic decisions in a player-driven economy. Derated after second play due to tediousness of figuring the costs of raising monuments with all secondary craftsmen on the map. Lots of downtime due to this alone.

RATING: 10
This is a Splotter game that plays in 2 hours with 4 players!!! (all players must know the game). Splotter has found a new way to build an economy out of simple rules. It has also the interesting mechanism that as you get better technologies/specialists that will help you to win the game, the victory points required to win the game grow. It is a delicate balance that only after you play a couple of games you will know what is worth what and when. Excellent game for gamers!

I liked this a lot.  The bidding for turn order mechanism is really intriguing.  Your bid gets allocated out to all the players in turn (collectible after it resolves), so you're likely to get some of your bid back, and quite often when you win it might be that you bid something like 7 but get 6 of it back, but if you really need to go first you can get screwed bidding 12 but only getting 8 back.    You can also end up making money if the other players are in a fight for first.  The variety and asymmetry of the god powers is interesting and by taking special powers you raise how many VP's you need to win.  Unlike a lot of eruos where you are stockpiling resources, this one is about pulling resources from around the board, which are only usable once per turn.  So it feels almost like a pick up and deliver game in terms of the spatial planning.  The competition for who gets to use resources first leads to a lot of contention for turn order.  The only real downside is that we got hung up on some unclear minor rules questions, and I'm not entirely sure we played them all right.

RATING: 7.5
My most expensive game [well, this has now been exceeded by another Splotter game, Bus]. Reminiscent of Container in that players are actors in an economy and need to use each other's capabilities (paying for them) in order to get anywhere.

TGZ has a map, though. I don't usually want to think about a map (unless the strategic considerations resulting from them are quite simple) but I thought the map in this game might be interesting because it's randomized/modular and might provide a different feel to each game. This is the main issue where my jury is still out: I'm not sure if different games will have different feels to them. I need to play more.

My first game was more interesting than I probably deserved (I didn't do any long term planning yet the outcome was not very close); I hope I can get better with more play. Although I'm intrigued by these economic games I'm not sure I'm wired to perceive how to play well.

...With more play the opacity lessens. My dislike of maps has also lessened, at least for games like this. So I've raised the rating slightly.

I do think that if you use all of the options the game offers you (specialists, precise price setting) there are too many options to consider on your turn, for my taste.

...I think my trouble in playing well is that there are enough things to do on your turn that it never strikes me as too important to bid that much for turn order (unless I'm rolling in money). Yet the opportunities open to you clearly aren't all equal and clearly are limited in number.

This game has gone directly into my top ten list because it's that good. Obviously a lot of money for something with very few components but if you have the money then buy it. Not as fiddly as other Splotters but calculating which resources go to which monument is a big puzzle that is actually fun to solve together around the table. The best feature about this game is how you have to balance added abilities with a higher victory requierement.

RATING: 9
Rated after two back-to-back plays: could go either direction withmore table time.  Both of the other players expressed a desire to play it again soon—always a good sign! 

No complaints here about the components and the art is quite nice. As to the cost: it's a Splotter game and thus to be expected.  The first couple I bought I admit produced a bit of sticker shock, but ended up proving their value.  Now, I don't even hesitate.

Interesting dynamics. Hard to say after one play, how well this works. I guess playing time differs much, because it depends how people play. If market has high prices from beginning speed decreases significantly. Also use of different elements affects how much points you have to collect. It is definetely interesting, but price tag is too high for me.

A rather bare bones game of economic and logistical competition. The system itself is fairly simple which leaves more time to focus on playing the other players.  I'll agree with something I read elsewhere about this being a game you win more by cutting off all the other player's paths to victory. I cannot get enough.

A slimmed-down Roads & Boats, in the sense that the focus remains on network building, but the game plays much faster. I love the mechanic that the players' victory requirements fluctuate as certain cards come into play, which leads to asymmetric, but often close finishes. The modular board tiles and varying choice of gods make each game feel unique. All in all, a very elegant design, and a worthy purchase, should you find a copy in your price range!

TGZ is a masterpiece, Splotter's crown jewel. This has everything I like in games: consummately spatial, highly interactive, unrivaled in its dynamism (a single action can drastically alter the landscape), with a unique and intriguing auction. This is what gaming is all about for me.

RATING: 5
The game is well designed, but it's a little bit more work than I'm willing to put into a game to enjoy it.  Too much of the game is abstract visualization of things (figuring out what's connected to what and through which hubs is something you just have to be able to do; there are no gaming elements that serve as a reminder for these steps), and I'm not very good at that sort of thing.  Were I to be keeping up with it for myself, it might be fine, but to do well, I have to be able to it for everyone so I know who to affect by taking my own pieces.  It's not an intuitive game, either, since you can get a good money engine going, but if you don't know what to do with that money, you're going to get easily shafted.  The design seems to be just fine, but it's just not something I enjoy that much.

My gamers game choice for Essen 12. Probable the most interactive of all the Splotter games. No multi-player solo game here. You will need to use the abilities of other players to advance your agenda. Auction mechanism is interesting as is the mechanism where the cards you take increase your target VP requirements based on their ability to help you. This one had my brain burning on where to place my monuments and how to maximize my income.

I like heavy games, but . . . I'd prefer that they are fun.  Zimbabwe is a perfectly good, well designed game, but it feels more like work than a game.  Finding all of the right deliveries on the small, congested board every turn isn't enjoyable - it is just laborious.

Initial rating - 8.5.  After a couple plays with DQ and Michael, as well as some with The Wife and The Mom, I can see this game is good.  How will it evolve as I play it more - that is the question.  My only 10 - Cosmic Encounter - continued (continues?) to reveal new layers of strategy (thanks in no small part to the various aliens).  The Gods of TGZ seem to have potential in this regard, but will 12 be enough?


Update 2/13:  This game is great.  I'm close to calling it a 10.  Having played Eshu four times and won 3 times, my opponents are wondering if he is too powerful, yet while I play I can clearly see moves they SHOULD be making to stop me, but they aren't seeing them.  This game has potential to share honors with CE...or even dethrone the champ.  The lack of luck and chaos is delicious!

Abstract area control puzzle. Get clay to make pots, stack them as shrines to the heavens. Barter with cattle. Selecting a specialist or God to worship is game long commitment. More powerful Gods increase the points you need for victory.  The designer uses some rule mechanics that are new and interesting to me.

Reminiscent of Antiquity in its spatial elements and control given to players but also to some extent Container with its closed economy where you can set your own prices for goods. In The Great Zimbabwe, you set up production chains to improve your monuments and claim the VPs you need to win. However, the interesting part is the more special abilities you take, the more VPs you'll need to win: your VP target gets further away. You can play a simple game and not take many bonus cards, leaving you with a minimum amount of VPs you need, or you can make things easier for yourself with some extra powers (enhanced production, ignore building restrictions etc.) but you'll need more points to win. There are many different special power cards and you only use a selection of these in each game, which provides some variability.

Whoever has the highest VP target bids first in the unusual turn-order auction. In this phase, money (cattle) spent is distributed among all players involved, so you could get some back yourself if you bid high enough. There's high competition for resources, as each can only be used once per turn and you need more and more different resources to keep upgrading your monuments. This makes the turn-order auction particularly important.

The game is not as long as some of Splotter’s offerings - our two-player learning game was completed within an hour.

Some great ideas (bidden for player order, selecting a god once per game, moving your own VP target) but messy execution. Took too long, and you can get locked out of the game early. Liked the art on the cards, but didn't like the board design.

Seemed like it could be an ok game, but only after you fully understand the concept and have a general idea of what all the cards on the table do and WHY you would want to take any of them.  It definitely would take multiple plays to get good at, but I didn't like it enough to even bother playing more.  I found the art / components to be unremarkable, and I also didn't find the player aids to be all that useful.  Way too expensive for what it is, but after all, it is a Splotter game.

another pretty good splotter, that plays in a quite reasonable time.  good mechanics, and theme.  It bogs down somewhat when the second tier crafters come into play, since it becomes very difficult to figure out what you can or cannot use to pay for your totems.  Dislike.

There are a lot of interesting things going on in Zimbabwe.  The basic goal of raising your temples is pretty straight forward but the decision space to make that happen is very broad.  The most clever mechanic changes to Victory Point requirement for every player depending on what special ability cards they select so balancing getting cool stuff with not making victory difficult to achieve is pretty neat.  The spatial economy seems fun to play with too especially as building the refined goods makes the first level good obsolete for temple raising so building those level 2 goods can change the dynamics of the map dramatically.

Overall its a very solid middleweight game, but the moving of goods through temples led to a lot of thinking/planning/mathing that slowed the game down a bit in the later stages.  Really quite enjoyable and I'd be interested in a copy if they weren't outrageously expensive.

RATING: 9
Another great Splotter game.  When I first read the rules, the game seemed very uninspired and just another resource/route/build game.  However, the simple rules end up producing a game with a lot of strategy and hard decisions.  When you choose a god or build another craftsman, it makes you stronger, but now you have to work harder to win because the required number of victory points just changed.  Bidding gets pretty brutal at the end.

The game, on the whole, is very simple… except for building up monuments, which is of course the crux of the game.  The convolution involved in trying to gather enough distinct items for the ritual can be delightfully challenging… and costly and/or profitable.

The choices you must make, and the resource-gathering logistics can heat up your head significantly.  I like it!

Difficult and deep because of the many strategies that are at your disposal from turn one. I particularly like the cattle bidding mechanism, the fact that you can set your own prices for goods, the gods that change the game, that you can adjust the VP to score and win the game based on how many extra's you take. 
The complex side is the representation of craftsmen, hubs, monuments on an abstract board with squares. It probably scares some people away. It's good they chose an African theme since African themed games are scarce. The theme is somewhat linked to the trading routes through hubs you create.

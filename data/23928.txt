I really like the system. The chit pull is a blast. The facing rules are clever. This is a light, fun series with plenty of goodness. I wish more battles were covered. We need Glory IV, V, VI, etc.
The only downside is that a) The battles are a bit long and b) Maybe not the best battles. Antietam seems to capture the nuances, but can bog down. Cedar Creek is a lot of fun, but is basically unwinnable by the the Confederates.

Something didn't fully work for me to completely like and appreciate this game. It is surely a player friendly game and after a few turns the main mechanics are mastered easily. The game, as usual with Berg, is historical accurate and the map reflects perfectly the real battlefield. I played only Antietam, but honestly I didn't find myself dragged into the game. Charge, artillery fire and defensive fire are per se easy, but there are many terrain modifiers which apply and stacking rules that require the player to carefully check the table before making a "suicidal" move. Extended move is not really used and often the line of sight for artillery is not easy to determine. I believe that the rules do not give many options to the players given the scale of the game. I will try to replay it in the future to see if I can appreciate it better.

I managed to go thirty years without owning or playing an American Civil War game despite studying the subject in adult education history classes and absorbing the superb Ken Burns TV series. That all changed when I bought this game last year from a fellow gamer. It's not the most complicated or detailed of game systems but it's a good entry level game for someone unfamiliar with the tactical doctrine of the era.

The system seems unnecessarily more complicated than for example GMT's Battles of the American revolution series. The smaller 9/16" counters and the small hexes plus rules for facing of the units make it too much fiddly for my taste. Sold it.

I really like the system, however I´m not so sure about the battles in this one. 
I only played Ceder Creek wich was fun, but is quite one sided and the side that probably wins does have hardly anything to do for the first half of the game. There is an alternative scenario wich should fix the balance a bit, but makes the first turns even more boring for the union. So it´s definately more of a battle for solo play.
I also played the intro scenario of Antinam. This one has only 5 turns, but seems to promise quite some fun for the full battle. The full battle will take nearly 20 hours probably, so it could be a while till I get it on the table.
Conclusion: Beautiful system, but of the two battles provided one seems a bit problematic and the other is really long. A midsized  (balanced) scenario or two would have really helped this game.

Started solo, but yet to get far into a game.. so:

The chit pull for initiative works very nicely in solo play to keep an air of tension. Mechanics are pretty simple with very little chrome. My early instinct is it doesn't feel like the bloodiest day of the Civil War, but could be wrong.

Antietam starts in quite a dynamic situation. Interesting to see how the contrast of large, ponderous army vs smaller, quicker force plays out.

Middle-weighted tactical wargame. Has three American Civil War scenarios on two big maps. I would rate it higher if it would provides more and shorter scenarios. It uses Napoleonic-like units and tactics and the card-less [u]Chit-Pull[/u] System mechanic who allows excellent [color=red]solitaire[/color] playing. It uses the outdated odd calculation in battles.
Good [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/7599802]house rules[/url] to improve the realism (also, I add a +1 modifier to the Cohesion roll to make unit's recovering harder).
Sometimes I play it using my own simplified rules (no Leaders, no Facing, no Recovery, a lot of exceptions removed etc.) who allow enjoyable sessions.

A pretty nice demi-brigade system that avoids some of the chrom-ey excess of its GBACW regimental big brother, but provides far more meat than simpler brigade-level games. This might just scratch your ACW tactical itch. Based on only one play of each: the Cedar Creek game is well-balanced and tense. The Antietam game seems perfectly suited for the chit-pull mechanics.

Early impressions are favorable. I never played Glory II, so I have only the original game as a basis of comparison. 

The rules have been simplified from the "old" Glory rules in some ways: gone are ZOC rules (though units still must stop moving when they move adjacent to an enemy), gone is the Infantry Fires phase of combat. This second omission really speeds up the game; combats now take only half to 2/3 as long as before. Return Fire now gets it's own table, which is used by both infantry and artillery (some of these things were probably changed in Glory II, but again- I never played that game).

Berg taketh away, but he also giveth... for every old rule that was omitted, there are one or two new things to take its place. Add to the mix: leaders (units must be within a leader's command radius to be in command), stacking (2 infantry of the same command can now stack, and this creates a host of new albeit simple rules to cover stacks as they relate to movement, facing, combat, etc.), bonuses for charging and defensive fire in clear terrain, and combined activation (requires a successful leadership test in order to have 2 commands activate simultaneously and cooperatively for that activation). 

To me, this is starting to feel less like the old Glory system and more like GBACW-lite, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The changes to the rules add depth in the right places, without slowing down the game. The game itself plays faster than ever due to the simplified infantry combat system, whereby firing, charging, and their effects on the defender are all handled by a single die roll. And at this scale, it works. I like it.

However, all the good stuff comes at a considerable investment. I tend to think this game is a bit more complicated than the "4" complexity on the back of the box would indicate. Consider: there are separate terrain effects columns for Artillery Fire, Defensive Fire, Charge, Inf/Leader Movement, Cavalry Movement, and Artillery Movement. There are SIX TYPES of slopes, with a different modifier for each of the above 6 columns, for a grand total of THIRTY-SIX possible DRMS (along with footnotes in most cases) just for slopes. The new stacking rules introduce lots of additional complexity just to cover every conceivable case involving something happening to a unit in a hex where another unit also resides. The rules do an admirable job of covering everything- there are just a lot of cases to learn, and we found ourselves spending almost as much time digging through the excellent rulebook as playing the game.

I need to spend more time with the individual battles to comment on play balance. I'm setting up the full Antietam game now. I'll try to post a review after I've played both of the big scenarios in the game.

RATING: 4
The combat system allows for better tactical planning, compared to Triumph & Glory - it's not a total crap shoot here. But rules ambiguities/question marks, in particular LOS and some tricky bits of combat, detracts from the experience. 

So again, as in Triumph & Glory, the full game is simply too much trouble to bother grokking the system. 

And err... isn't this Antietam, where some regiments suffered 50% casualties. Nobody dies in this game!

Comments from playing the full Antietam scenario-

The game delivered a rough, plausible simulation of the battle. The start was well-represented, a lumbering Allosaur of two Union corps meandering into a heap of Confederate artillery and well formed lines. Fights broke out, charges happened, stuff was disorganized and withdrawn. Both sides  know that the key to the battle is control of the three +1 DRM points to the Union's die roll for the number of activation points, and the struggle is intensely fought over these points. More than a few times the Confederates would sacrifice brigades in bad spots just to prevent advance to those points, and not defending in depth for those areas is madness. 

Then a few turns later it hit me-nothing was really dying. This was a battle with a monstrous butcher's bill, yet for the most part a good 1/2 or so of the brigades were later able to return to the fight as if nothing happened. Many more brigades that had charged or were charged were able to reform as if nothing happened one or two activations later.

The game abstracts out the fact that these brigades were likely completely wrecked, have dead officers abound and tons of stragglers. Most would certainly not be able to fight again effectively until replacement and retraining long after the battle.

Don't get me wrong-the game plays very well and the same main factors that were present in the real fight (Union command issues, Lee in over his head and grossly underestimating the Union soldier's willingness to fight hard, Confederate artillery advantages, it's good stuff), but the lack of "messiness" of the actual battle really starts to be apparent at turn 7-8 or so, when you look over at the "dead pools" and realize there is just a handful of units there when in reality there were over ten thousand casualties piled up well before noon.

As other players noted, once the Union gets it's first extra AM marker you are in a whole heap of trouble from the Confederate side, and runaway Union victories are possible even with all of the "curbs" that the historical scenario rules provide. I think there is also a potential for a strong Confederate win as well, but a lot depends on how the early die rolls for Union activations go. 

Mechanically, I think there are too many artillery rolls with too little effect for each roll. Partially this is due to artillery being great on defense and playing a big role in the fight, but toning down the amount of rolls there for a game of this scale would have been nice.  

I like the system and the scenario does provide a rough simulation of the fight from a command perspective-I just think that some parts of the scenario are a bit undercooked.

Another beautiful and well-made game by GMT, but I just don't care for it at all.  In fact I don't care for any of GMT's Civil War Series games, although GMT is my favorite game company. First of all there are just too many rules.  There are the series rules and the play book. But, if you can pretty well learn one of the games in the series, you should be able to learn the rest of them. I found that I kept having to refer to the rules too many times that I just got frustrated with it and finally sold it.

In all fairness to the game, I didn't give it much of a chance, but anyone who loves the Civil War Era, and has lots of times to study the rules may very well love the game.

Considering that Cedar Creek and Antietam are excellent examples of command control problems, the system fits like a glove, although Antietam is not all that enjoyable. McClellan rules are too punitive. So far this is my favorite Civil War tactical system, which is impressive considering that the Battle of Antietam has never really captured my imagination.

UPDATE: I am more taken with the drama and horror of Antietam now. That being said the system has issues. Mostly, attacking is hard but also easy to bounce back from. Units can go through the meat grinder many times if they have a high enough cohesion level.

RATING: 7.5
played the system (glory III) with 1st manassas. imo this is one of the best grandtactical systems for the civil war for two reasons: it enables the player to focus on the role of the overall commander and permits a smooth playing of complex situations without investing huge amounts of time, giving the player a good feeling of commanding an army in battle in that period of history. 

the only drawbacks are about losses and defensive fire vis a vis the tales and books wrote about the real battles.  
In this system the units have a real chance of "coming back" anew, expecially if they have a good morale. This, not coupled with a registration of losses at higher echelons of commands (corps), makes some formations unstoppable in battles lasting more than one day. and so, what's about "units/command exaustion"? 
defensive fire it's a clever simulation mechanic but I've read that in the civil war the act of exiting the zone of influence of an enemy brigade is as dangerous as declaring a "charge" at it, expecially as the war progresses on.

I've write some house rules to resolve the mentioned problems and I'm going to post these soon.

Good: ACW - Tactical - Easy

Plus:
-Very Easy system: jump and play for veteran wargamesrs
-Great components.
-Fun to play, intuitive rules.
-What simple GboH is to GboH, is Glory to GbaCW; sort of GBacW light.

Minus:
-Literally counter pushing: CRT provides lot's of retreats rather than losses.
-This volume has imo no inspiring battles, I prefer Chanleorsville 100 times over Antietam.

So far I've only played this game solitaire. I do like chit pull for solitaire: it reduces fundamental problem of solitaire play, which is that I already know what the other side will do next. In this case, I don't, because I don't know which command will be activated.

However, I still find this game unsatisfying for solitaire play. For one thing, much of the game is spent rolling against units' cohesion ratings to see if they become disorganized. That works more or less, and it makes play very fast, but it's not much fun to charge a line in the flank and watch them become... disorganized. (Maybe -- it usually depends on their cohesion roll.) I'd like some carnage, please.

I imagine the streamlined play would be a breath of fresh air in a head-to-head game where the focus is on competition, but for solitaire it doesn't seem so great. I'd like some more complexity to keep myself thinking about each move. (I don't mean die roll modifiers; this game does have plenty of those.)

On the plus side, I found the rules very straightforward. There are some flaws in the presentation and wording, but nothing so far that I haven't been able to figure out to my satisfaction. Also, the low limits on stacking are helpful for my clumsy fingers. And I like the smaller artillery and cavalry counters; that was a nice touch, since they are only allowed to stack on top of the larger infantry counters.

A wonderful "Beer & Pretzels" game that doesn't disappoint. Units don't get eliminated as much as they do get removed, regrouped and returned. It's a bloodless fight that has players seeking strategy to out-due their opponent instead of sheer losses. A game I highly recommend both as an educational tool and to play just for the joy of it.

Generally meets its aims of a simpler ACW system, but has to give up a few things to do this. DF takes no account of defending unit's strength, and units can withdraw as a result of fire and then return back at full strength (eventually). However, it's pretty easy to play, and gives a decent feel of ACW battles. I like it.

However, the Antietam scenario doesn't make the best usage of the system, and is pretty hard to achieve the results the Union did.

The best and perhaps final game in the Glory series. The rules are rock-solid and the gameplay compelling and enjoyable. Unlike Glory II, these are both single map games that can be played to completion in a reasonable amount of time. Cedar Creek is especially interesting since it is a battle that is not often seen in board wargaming. Antietam fits this system like a glove because of the uncertainty of the chit pulls. 

Now if only we could talk Richard Berg into doing more games on this series.

Having only played Antietam, I can say that while I like the Glory system, the nature of the battle allows for no kind of strategy to be employed.  It is just a matter of ramming infantry into each other and rolling dice.  The only strategy that can be employed here is to plan on rolling well.

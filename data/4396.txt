+ It's a two-player racing card game.
- In the end, it just didn't feel like much fun.


Why it's previously-owned:
While it's a decent game in its own right, there are just too many other two-player games that are more engaging.  There was nothing special that put this game over the top for us. 
I traded this away for GIPF.

One of the worst Kosmos 2-players I've seen.  Longish, annoying, repetitive, luckish.

A shame, in a way -- the pieces/cards are nifty looking, and I like the aux. cards hand management/action point trade-off system.

Bleah.  With two intelligent players, this will take forever to be decided by, er, luck.

Odin's Ravens is a quick, little card-driven game from the Kosmos 2-player game series. Is it too simple? UPDATE: A definite keeper as something light and easy in the game collection. Very enjoyable race game with nice artwork. 2015 UPDATE: I remember this as being a good filler game, so the rating stays as is.

Purchased this to play with my eight year old daughter.  It was the perfect choice.  She picked it up right away.  Gameplay is very fluid, the artwork\design is certainly attractive and draws you into the game.  I would qualify this as lighter fare as the strategic elements aren't demanding.  This is appropriate because that is the games appeal, having a light and carefree feel.  The game does stand above the crowd however do to the cohesiveness of its various parts and the superb presentation thereof.  Definitely a solid family game as it easily bridges the age gap.

RATING: 7
A light card game that gives you a few things to think about.  There's an auxillary deck that needs seeding but can be powerful in allowing you to do (up to) twice as much in your turn.  There is also a decision to be made as to how much you will be distracted by the Magic Way.  Do you extend the flight path at the end of your turn; could your opponent finish if you don't?  Luck of the draw certainly matters, but you can churn through cards in the hope of drawing something more useful.   

An enjoyable and distinctive race game, with a little more depth than the average Kosmos two-player.

Card quality is just OK.  The artwork is quite bland, though entirely functional.  The rules seem complete.

Ravens de Odin es un juego de cartas donde los ravens compiten entre ellos a lo largo de una pista hecha de las tarjetas que representan diversos tipos de tierra. Los jugadores juegan a las cartas que coinciden con los tipos de la tierra para poder mover sus ravens. Hay también las cartas de Odin que permiten que el jugador cambie la pista de las cartas del paisaje y también afectar al otro jugador.

A gussied-up race game.  The track is unique for each player and consists of a two part card that resembles a domino.  Players attempt to move along their side of the course by playing cards that match the terrain.  The course is built during the game and affords the players strategic opportunity to place benficial terrain on their side while hindering the opponents' progress.  One of the better games in the Kosmos 2-player series.  [GTI Code: TGCL]

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Initial Impression: This is a light, two player racing game which rewards good hand management. The decisions are involve whether to use cards for raven movement, save in reserve, or commit to the "Magic Way" bonus points. This is a tactical game with a fair amount of luck but is still fun nonetheless. In our initial plays the races seemed to be over too quickly. The Odin block cards were initially difficult to deal with but over time we learned how best to overcome them. My son has taken a liking to this game, perhaps because of the quick play time. This would make for a good filler game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Excellent Game. Very fun, very flavorful and decent replay value. The rule allowing an optional landscape card to be added at the end of each players turn is the key to this game's beauty, in my opinion.

Struggles with the problem of indeterminate game length.  Some games can go quick but some can get very long as each player tacks more and more tiles to the end of their path.

While I've enjoyed my games of Odin's Ravens, I've found that it can last a little long for what it offers in terms of strategies. Otherwise, a neat little game that gives you a few different choices on how you'd like to proceed towards game end.  One step backward sometimes equals two steps forward.

I enjoyed playing this with my 8 year old. Its light but has enough strategy to really challenge a kid while being enjoyable for an adult. Two ravens are in a race to see the world, flying over various lands that require the play of matching cards to traverse. There are opportunities to block, jump ahead, and score alternative points via magical paths. My kid picked this one out of the pack of games and had a good time playing it.
Update: After several plays this is an average game that lacks sufficient depth for my interest.

I was looking for a two player game that I thought my wife would enjoy with me, and decided to add Odin's Ravens to my Christmas list.  I received it, and for the first three games my wife thought it was a super game...she thoroughly dominated me.  Since then the cards have been falling my way.  It's always nice to find a fairly short two-player game that my wife is willing to play with me.  Even with the randomness of the cards you have to strategize, and the artwork on the cards is just icing on the cake.  [Gift]

Solid little card game in a small box with two cute wooden ravens that look like rabbits upside down.

Room for some strategy and tactics and favours those who can card count. Ultimately a little prone to the right cards dropping in your lap. 40 mins suggested play time but our game ran to 2 hours with it being nip and tuck all the way to 12 points.

Excellent racing game, and I like the mechanic of storing cards for later use.  It's been a hit with non-gamers for me.  

I keep this game around because it's a nicely produced, unique racing game with a plan-ahead mechanic, plus player interaction through the Odin cards.  It plays quickly and well, and non-gamers really like it!

A simple, tight, and very competitive race game. It's all about trying to balance advancing your own raven with hindering your opponent's, as well as preparing yourself for later turns, and keeping an eye on the bonus "magic way" points. There's a lot to think about, but it's so sleek and streamlined. And the illustrations are quite lovely.

RATING: 5
What an oddly-themed race game. The way it plays is very straightforward and I imagine would reward experienced players. I liked the special action cards and how they would adjust strategies, and I liked the separate goal that force you to divide your attention. The sad thing is I just didn't find the overall game to be all that exciting. First of all, I understand the concept of adding cards to the race in order to slow down your opponent, but I found it almost too risky to do in reality because you could potentially be giving your opponent more points. It also struggles making any thematic sense, but I suppose that's not the point of the game. I'm not particularly fond of games where you have cards that can hurt your opponent so badly, and I think that might be the other thing I didn't enjoy. One card from me forced my opponent to spin his wheels for 2 turns as I raced to the finish line. When we packed up I found the game satisfactory, but I didn't have that excited feeling where I thought "If I had more opportunities to play 2-player, I'd definitely get this game." It just didn't live up to games like Dragonheart and Jambo that I've played in the past.

2 player racing game with some clever mechanics that make it interesting, including an auxiliary card stack, bonus points for the "magic way" cards and terrain cards with different terrain on the top and bottom of the card that can be flipped during play.

RATING: 10
Replayed this 10 years later and my thoughts are completely different.  Probably because I had just gotten into modern Eurogames back then and probably wanted more from this.

My new play of this was fantastic.  It is a great game with a nice balance of luck and skill.  The Odin cards give just enough room for thoughtful tactical play without becoming a TCG power fest.  The Auxilary pile adds just a bit of planning ahead, and the Magic Way adds a secondary scoring opportunity that's worth just enough that you can't forget about it.

The hands play quickly, and luck can play a big part, mainly in the card draws, but also in that the other player can pull a big move with a lucky draw and a little good planning and you can blow a hand out of nowhere.

So, I would say this game has more of a feel of traditional card game, but with a lot of good Eurogaming touches added in to turn it into an enjoyable modern gaming experience for two.

There is really nothing I didn't like about it.  My wife and I will play it often.


(2006) (rated 6) It seems that each hand of this game is won by whoever goes first, with the overall winner being decided by that 1 extra point that is eked out by one of the went-first hand winners.  That may sound like it makes for an intense game, but my wife and I found it be like we were just going through the motions.

This is a great two player game. My current favorite. It has a lot of player interaction and some cool puzzle solving elements. Very easy to learn and exciting to play. We use card holders for the auxiliary deck. That way you can always see what you have and you don't have to keep looking at them or trying to memorize The order. We also play that when you extend the track, you don't get to choose the orientation. Fantastic game.

If a game needs to be unthematic, try at least to make it simple and fast: this way even Odin’s Ravens becomes surprisingly fun, mainly thanks to its very intuitive gameplay and basic strategy making for a game that doesn’t limit your playing choices but rather tries to leave you as much freedom as it can.

Played this once at Origins on the recommendation of someone there for a two-player game. It felt extremely "meh" and I had no fun while playing it. That being said, it was the last game of a long day and I just now discovered that we were playing it wrong re: the Magic Way (due to an error in the rules booklet, I understand?).

So I could probably be convinced to try it again, but for now it's sitting at 3. Didn't much care for it, too many other games I'm interested in.

I love this game!  I discover more tricks and strategems every time I play.  Very different kind of card game that rewards clever play.  Make sure to use the corrected rules (Odins_Ravens.pdf); the rules published in the American edition are incorrect and detract a lot from the game's strategy.

[Bought 2nd hand from gkgbg:bradspel.net 2009-09-17]
Yet another Kosmos 2-player game that is very fun and entertaining.
Has also the same card types as Caesar & Cleopetra - long and thin type of cards.
Gameplay is very easy as you only have a couple of different things you can do.
That you can build up an extra pile that you can use to make good progress in the game put a nice bit of strategy in the game.

I played with both of my teenage daughters and wife, and they all enjoyed this game. However, the luck factor seems heaviest in this of our two player games, though the auxillary deck play is an important tactic. UPDATE: after more plays (most of them requests from the girls), the auxillary deck option definitely has proved to be an important strategy in card management. I win most of the games, due to card play related to the path of flight that the raven's must take. Most games will be determined by judicious handling of the cards, from both the auxillary and hand cards.

RATING: 6
A fun time for two players. A little luck heavy, but playing multiple races (to the 12 point total) evens this out. Strongly recommended.

However, one's enjoyment of it can pale with time. Eventually, the optimal strategies become pretty apparent, after which it becomes more of an activity (and less of a game).

Not bad, definitely at the "lighter" end of the Kosmos 2-player line, but to my mind the best of the lighter games. Not in the same class as Caeser & Cleopatra or the Settlers/Starfarers games, but has the "non-threatening" appeal of The Reef with a little more for the gamer to sink his or her teeth into. Not a ringing endorsement, I'll grant you, but quite good if you know what you're looking for.

Nice game but you cycle cards so much each turn that there doesn't look to be much scope for strategy or planning. You more just play what you've got. If you can't play it has a nice system to store up card and use them for other purposes (the magic way and 2 cards being wild). The Odin cards add a little take that element.

Fun race game with a lot more strategy then it may appear at first.  It's important to play with the correct Magic Way rules (=a bidding war for exactly 3 pts). Sometimes it's frustrating; I don't enjoy being stuck behind the Odin marker, and not all games make me feel that way. The landscape art is lovely; the raven markers inviting. My non-gamer friends like this one.  // Update.... We haven't played this in a year, so I'm lowering the rating a bit.

The artwork or color scheme of the terrain gives me a bit of a headache sometimes.  If it had bold, appealing colors, I'd probably rate it at least a half-point higher.

Here we have the basic elements of many 2-player games distilled into a simple idea - a race that involves a constant push-and-pull between opponents.  Line up the right landscape cards to surge ahead.

What I like - very simple rules and it plays very quickly once you have the hang of it.  The cards are all attractively designed.  And having 2 options on each Odin card is clever.

What bothers me - I feel like the magic way cards are too over-powered - a 3-point bonus is huge in a game with otherwise incremental wins in a given race.  Also the auxiliary pile seems unnecessary.

I definitely hope to play this game more in the future to try and dig into some of the potential strategies.

I enjoy this one a lot.  The two player games are great when only my brother-in-law and myself can get together, and this one plays fast most of the time, although we seem to get bogged down at some point about once per game, trying to think through a situation too much.  You do the best with the cards that you draw, which to me is a balance between luck and skill.  Not a whole lot of direct interaction, but then again the race-like feel usually has us watching each other's moves like a hawk.

I have to say that after my first two plays with the wife, that this is one of the best 2-player games that I have ever played.

And of course, as a collector of norse-themed games, I had to have this one early on.  It just took far too long to table it.  Not anymore.

One of the better two player Kosmos games to appear recently.  Players play cards up to 3 cards from their hand to move their raven across different terrain, or play cards to a "supply" deck.  Up to three cards can be played from this deck also, allowing the planning of a killer six card play.  Action cards mess with the route.  Good fun, although it feels a little long - certainly longer than the 40 minutes on the box.

Well, being a sucker for hand management games makes me an easy mark for this game. This is a great two-player game with a lot of interaction a fairly mitigated amount of interfering with your opponent. There are an awful lot of permutations you can do with the Odin cards, and it certainly rewards clever powermoves. Along with Lost Cities and Blue Moon, the best of the spouse-friendly games for two.

RATING: 4
One thing I like in this game is pulling off combos to manipulate the track and ending a race resulting in a lot of the points gained.  The unfortunate thing is that there definitely is a luck element on what cards you draw versus the track order and who gets Odin cards in a specific order.  It also felt too long for what it was if you really play to win.  The thing I disliked the most about it were the cards themselves.  I hate the shape and the fact that I can't sleeve them.  That goes for you too Tribune and Caesar & Cleopatra.  Is it too much to ask for companies to make playing cards the same size as Magic or Yugioh so we can buy sleeves for ease of shuffling and protecting our investment?

Can be a bit swingy with the luck of the land layout and cards in hand, but heck if it isn't a fun 20 minutes or so. The game plays quick enough that luck is not usually a huge problem for me. There's just not a lot here after a few plays I think. It's got some fun mechanisms though.

RATING: 8
First play was operating on less than 3 hours of sleep, so we agreed to simplify it as a learning experience, and left the Magic Way out of it entirely.   Instead of playing to 12 points, we just played 4 rounds.

My 17 year old son won the first and last round, and I took the two middle ones, but the end total, he had 8 points and I had 4.  The games he won were played at their original length, in both of the ones I won, I lengthened the course.

Fun game, and I definitely have a grasp of it, so, lack of sleep aside, I should be able to cope with the full rules without a problem...

A good option as a 2P card game superior to most others I've tried. Lots of intricate card play, plays smoothly, and I found myself with plenty of options for offense or defense in spite of this being a card game and relying on card draws.

I find less luck here than at first glance. Two skilled players can get into some very tight battles, leaping forward and pulling each other back. As a result, there's nice tension.

Pretty good, although not as good as Lost Cities.  The Odin cards seem a bit over-powered (except for the one that lets you rearrange your auxiliary stack, which rarely seems especially useful).

(2-player) Decent, fairly light game. Some people love it and talk about its depth but I haven't perceived any real depth. Mostly a tactical game of managing an ever-changing board state. Still, a good game when you don't want to think too hard and it offers enough levers to remain relatively entertaining. The multiple rounds to get to 12 points affords some good tug-of-war action.

Interesting diversion for the significant other.  The terrain sliding moves are fun with efficient planning, and the auxillery stack is key!  This feels like a light version of Elfenland, and may have a higher replay value after more games.  Currently I'm thinking it's only "so-so."  Grade: C

The mechanics of this game are simple enough to teach quickly, but make for intriguing play.  Because the game is played out over a series of races, and each race can go on indefinitely, for a widely variable number of points, it is hard to predict how long a game of Odin's Ravens will last.  For some reason, it seems that the longer a race goes on, the more likely it will be nearly a draw, meaning this game can take over an hour to complete!  When that happens, I'm usually not too keen on the game, because it's just not the sort of game you like to spend more than a half an hour at, in my opinion.

I had read some of the comments before playing my first game; yes it is better to always move ahead as much as possible every turn.  However, the 3 point bonus for the Magic Way cards forces a player to at least remain equal to his opponent.  That part is really random and is the only thing we disliked about the game.  Otherwise, lots of fun planning and racing your raven on a treck which seems to lengthen every turn.

RATING: 8
As simple to learn as Candyland, but with a bunch more strategy.  There is a big luck factor involved, but the Odin cards, together with being able to stash a bunch of cards to plan turns in the future make you feel enough in control to make this a wonderful little 2 player game.  And it plays out quick, so it has a nice "OOH!  One more game!" factor to it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
There are better 2 players card game out there, for example I prefer Balloon Cup. Too many things happen out of luck in Odin's Ravens, especially at the end when turn order becomes incredibly important. The biggest problem with this one are the rules. They aren't clear on many points. Example: you should remove cards when the table is full, but what if you'd like to pick one of the earlier card for an exchange with the special Odin's card?

At first I had my doubts, but the more I play  the better it gets.

What looks like a rather simple card-driven race on the outside turns out to be a twisty and rather deep affair that offers a surprising amount of opportunities for clever play in a pretty compact package.

I usually strongly dislike games where deliberately delaying the end of the game is a viable (or even encouraged) tactic but here it's the icing on the cake. You can never be sure that the finish line right ahead of you is still going to be there on your next turn, or that the other raven that so pathetically and unsuccessfully tried to keep up with you for the last few turns won't suddenly surge ahead as if supercharged by Odin himself.

I've been looking for Odin's Ravens for awhile. Finally picked up a copy on the used market. I do appreciate its quick playing, limited pieces, nice art, etc. and I do enjoy had management and race games. Many reviewers note that randomness has a lot to do with the game. This is true, but what you do with your cards is your decision. So that's okay. I find the Odin cards a little too much in the shade of "take that!" territory. But what really discouraged me from wanting to play it again is its inherent repetitive structure. I own a few quick games where you are supposed to play several games and add up the score. But OR is so simple in gameplay that having to play it multiple times is a bore. Also, the Magic Way seems like a lame catch-up mechanism. This game is on the border of being good but doesn't inspire me at all to play it again. Too bad as I like the look of it and the general idea.

A fun quick race game with variable ways to score to obtain victory.  Luck can have its way with this one, but most of the time it presents itself as a tense little game.

UPDATE:  I have raised this a half point to a seven.  I find that I enjoy this title with every outing, even if it doesn't have any real depth.  With that said however, my experience has taught me that the stonger player will usually win overall (even if losing a race enroute to 12 or 13 points) by managing both their hand and the auxillary deck they build.

A very good racing game of sort for two players. Actually it's sometimes good to come second as you can still score some points (in some cases even a bit more than the winner).

The great tactical game with fairly simple rules. I like it and enjoy playing it.

Being blocked by Odin on a terrain that you have none of can be randomly frustrating.  Unlike Lost Cities, or Balloon Cup, you don't have the feeling of needing to adapt or change strategies midway.  Each game is pretty much the same as the previous game and the next game.  With so many great two-player games out there, I think I'll be trading this one away. 5/10  (Paste-on theme)

Pleasantly light, with enough choices to keep it interesting the whole way through.  A very approachable game that I can see occupying the same niche as titles like Lost Cities and Flowerpower.  Make sure you have the errata for the "Magic Way!"

I haven't played the newer edition, but this older version is supposedly a bit more tactical and decision-rich.

A pretty good racing game. Each race goes very quickly, so the game is played to a set number of points. The game gives you a lot of options, but a very short amount of time in which to implement them. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The vagaries of the cards keep this rating slightly down.

The ability to manipulate the race 'track', and plan this manipulation in advance through the use of the auxiliary hand, is the gloriously good part of this game.

The trouble is, if you don't have some Odin cards, you can't formulate a brilliant and satisfying future manoeuvre to unleash on your opponent. And if you [i]do[/i] have some Odin cards, but the track is laid out in a manner from which you can squeeze only a tiny advantage, you can't formulate a brilliant and satisfying future manoeuvre to unleash on your opponent.

So you're reduced to inching forward in the race and Magic Way, while using up an inordinate amount of pairs of landscape cards as wilds just so you can do [i]something[/i] with your hand.

There are definitely times where a plan can be nurtured, executed, and celebrated, and those moments are fantastic. But there are rather too many times where you and your opponent are caught in a niggly match of chipping small advantages off each other while hoping for a lucky draw to keep your head in front.

Still fun enough to be a 7, but I'm wondering if a variant could bring the planning element closer to the fore.

PS. The compulsion to flip the ravens over to look like rabbits is surprisingly strong. I recommend complete submission to these furry urges.

RATING: 8
First edition. For a two player game with 112 cards, there's a lot of value in this compact package. Choose among progressing on your own raven's flight path, altering the path to your benefit and/or your opponent's detriment, playing to the bonus goal (magic way) card, or storing up for the future. Apparently the latter is being eliminated in the second edition, but I always liked the "push down stack" management. Then again, my wife and I studied computer science, so we understand push down stack management. Has a good amount of tension with more options than Lost Cities, so I like this one in the Kosmos two player series a bit better than Lost Cities.

RATING: 7.5
Much more than a race game, and a very original one. Luck of the draw is reduced by each player having his own deck (no complaining about the opponent getting all  the Odin cards) and by the clever mechanic of the auxiliary stack, which basically allows actions to be saved for future turns. Good and colorful artwork, but the Odin cards could have different and more meaningful pictures.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
rating based on one play.  pleasantly surprised at how much fun I had with this. started noticing some sneaky things you can do with odin cards that can completely change the landscape of the game and reverse player advantage.  However, this seems to be more dependent on player skill than luck as the card decks are small enough, so there is not too much luck in my opinion

Neat little two-player card game.  Plenty of interaction and a fun theme (I love corvids).  Each turn gives you a choice between moving your raven forward, setting yourself up for next turn, or going after bonus points.

RATING: 6
First played March 21st, 2008. Taught in 5min, played in 20min. Seems to favor the luck in the luck/strategy scale. Goal: accumulate 12 points first over the course of several races. There are four decks. A land deck (double sided), a player deck and a magic deck. Shuffle all decks. Turn over the top magic card. Turn over 9 land tiles one at a time. If a later land tile has the same land on either side, turn it 180 degrees. If it still has the same land tile, discard it and draw a new one. Each player takes 5 cards from their deck. Youngest starts, thereafter it's the low score. On your turn you have 3 action points. You can 1) play a card to magic (3 pts goes to player with most magic; ties do not)or 2) a land tiles if it matches (2 of same land for jokers; move forward 1-x of same land type, remove blockcade) 3) Reserve deck (for more options later), or 4) play an Odin card for a special action (move tokens; etc). First to end of land tiles wins race, pts awarded for each space you finish ahead of your opponent. It's a ok borrow, however not worth purchase.

The game is a pretty solid little 2 player filler adventure.  It keeps enough depth to hold a little more strategy than your standard caliber filler (the auxillary decks make the game, otherwise it would be quite straightfoward).  My rating could swing a point either way with a few more plays.  I haven't noticed any length issues as most people point out.

A very solid and fun game.  I rate it very similar to Kahuna in feel.  I really like the plan ahead feature of your axillary stack.  It makes sure that your three card limit never goes to waste, as long as you plan well.  Also, the magic way adds a little something for variety.  I worried the race could go forever if you kept adding land, but it's seldom beneficial, so we didn't do it often.

This is an excellent game to play with the casual gaming spouse.  The "auxiliary" hand, the ability for each player to add to the path, and the side race to claim the "Magic Way" points turns this into a much better game than I initially thought it would be.  There is quite a bit going on for such a short casual game.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (August 2013)

A regular light game. It has beautiful bits (although finding suitable sleeves for these cards was very hard) and regular art. I´m not impressed after one play, I will play again in the near future to properly re rate and comment. For now I feel the game is way too light and simple for my taste and the decisions kind of obvious. It has lots of luck, at least it doesn’t take a long time to play. I dislike racing games but I love mythology, still the theme is so thin, it doesn’t do anything for me. 

I have to read the rules and see if my friend taught it properly. I will give it another chance but for now I´m leaning toward selling it.

I recently played the 2nd edition and I found the game to be very bad. It is a streamlined version of this one, but in this case I think it is a worse game. This edition has more meaningful decisions (but they are very obvious).

Bottom line, I have realized that I deeply dislike the game (both editions). Odin's Ravens has lots of luck and obvious decisions. At least it pays fast but I won’t ever play it again and I´m selling my copy ASAP.

Neglected and underrated game. Gives the inaccurate impression of being luck-based because of random draw. Incredibly well-thought out mechanics nullify this, and make for an intense game where victory is often just out of reach and defeat dogs your footsteps. Once I "fathomed" the gameplay here, I went on a 13-0 winning streak against a very skilled strategy gamer. This game puts me in a state of hyper-focus. Just an incredible experience. See my review:

http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/162984

After moving to another state I have found myself without a steady opponent for this game, which reduces my desire to play it. I'd rather face-off in a series of challenging rematches than catch a game here and there with newer players.

My favourite from the Kosmos 2-player series so far. I consider this series to be aimed at couple play and for that aim Odin's Ravens fits us best. For tactical players there are other games like Rosenkönig or Blue Moon that offer more depth but this is at the cost of confrontation which hampers the game experience for my girlfriend. Compared to other light entries as Lost Cities this one hits the spot. The cards are attractive and the ravens are cute.

Bought on a whim from playme.de, as it was only EUR6.70 w/ fixed shipping. The first game I learnt from the original german ruleset. Yay for me and all those (previously: wasted) hours in school.

Gameplay itself is straightforward and remarkably fun for a simple race game. Somewhat tedious in that total playtime varies so much (20-50 minutes, depending on round length and scoring parity).

Once you get past the Magic Way confusion (read the corrections here on the Geek), this can be a tense little racing game.

And you have to love the raven meeples (our cat did).

RATING: 8
This game is great, I just wish it had a better less complicated rulebook. There is a newer version, but they dumbed it down far too much IMO. I also prefer the box of my old version (there's just something about Kosmos's small square boxes) and while the art in the new version is quite impressive, I don't find it as family-friendly as the old version's. If you have the opportunity, I highly recommend the original.

One day I'm going to re-write the rules to the game with taking the best aspects from both versions. Perhaps my favourite change in the new version is simply that they renamed the Odin's cards Loki cards as it just makes far more thematic sense. I also like some of the new Loki card abilities.

I know some people criticized the Magic Way for not being thematic enough, but I thought it was plenty thematic. The whole point of Odin's ravens, as far as I understand the stories, was for reconnaissance, not to race them, so the idea of the Magic Way was that they brought back useful intel. Similarly, going off the stories it makes sense that the birds would go off in different directions as there's not much point sending them in the same direction to acquire virtually the same intel. For a game about racing it makes sense to have, for the most part, the same track, but for a game about gaining intel, it doesn't.

I really think Osprey Games should have kept its new simple rules, but also fully added the ability to play the game with its old full rules. The new rules have no appeal to me whatsoever yet I probably would have bought the newer version had it done the above and played with it to keep my old version in pristine condition.

A racing game with quite amount of luck. If you have the right cards then the game is easy - when not you are in trouble. Few Odin-cards are too powerful I think and that's why the game is not very well-balanced. Not a great game, but well enough to play occasionally. Feels a little bit like Caesar & Cleopatra (but C&C is better one).

Fun, easy to learn, and usually very close.  Surprisingly, although so much is dependent upon the cards drawn during a turn, the game generally doesn't feel luck-based.  Can sometimes get a little annoying when a player just keeps enlarging the path to prevent the other player from winning...and, it seems rare that this actually ends up changing the outcome.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Decent little race game using cards.  First player to 12 points wins and this usually involves at least a couple races if not three.  I really liked the tweak where you can put cards down in the auxiliary pile where you can save them to play later (although they must be played in order).  Special cards allow you to break the rules or change the course which generally effects both you and the other player.

I definitely like the 2nd edition better in terms of artwork and gameplay. They made a lot of changes. I wanted to play the 1st edition to compare, and to try out things that were taken out of the game, such as the Magic Way cards. I think the updated changes were a good choice. The 1st edition just seems more blasé for some reason.

Another game in the Kosmos two player line that got a lot of praise was [GAMEID=4396], so we were eager to try it out.  Unfortunately, it fell pretty flat for us.  It feels like a mostly tactical race game with little long term strategy.  The cards were used mostly for movement, and there weren't very many special Odin's cards to use.  The hand management aspect was simply trying to match the terrain, which could be changed by your opponent, which made long term strategy difficult.  The auxiliary stack sounded like a good way to add additional hand management possibilties, but we felt the game was too random to really rely upon it.  The Magic Way component (with the corrected rules) seemed cobbled on and disconnected from the rest of the game and just a way to dump excess cards.  The cards themselves had a long, rectangular shape that was difficult to shuffle and the artwork made it a little confusing over which was the back and front.  Moreover, we had a couple of games that just didn't end since one of us would keep adding to the path.

All in all, although I think that you can dig a little deeper into it, it just felt like too simple of a game for us with not as many different options to keep us interested.

I don't have as much experience with racing games as I do other genres of euro. I don't have anything against them, but I haven't been drawn by them. Snow Tails is pretty good, and Top Race is kind of 'meh.' Odin's Ravens lies somewhere in between, good enough that I'm happy to play it, but it's easy to forget about when you're not looking at it.

There is a fair bit of luck of the draw at work since drawing the right special power card at the right time will win the race for you. If you're facing a brick wall, it often isn't of your making, and if the key card to unkink the course for you won't come you're screwed, too. Since a game is best two out of three races, this isn't necessarily fatal, but it's still frustrating, since it leeches all the fun out of that race.

One quirk that I'm not as fond of is that it's easier to come from behind after the first race of the set than it is to be a frontrunner. I suspect experience might help to even this out, but it is a pattern I and my regular opponents have noticed. It certainly leeches some of the "the luck will come out even in the wash" factor of playing out a set of races.

Upgraded from 8 to 9. Gains more depth with each play. I'm experiencing more tension now, and experimenting with strategies. e.g., I could have taken the race for 4 points, but my friend had the Magic Way locked up for 3. I decided to wait a bit and try to catch up on Magic Way or get further ahead. It didn't succeed but it was fun trying! ...Nice feel to this one - lush and open-ended, and not simply due to the fact that you can add on to the path. It's a nice break from so many other games where you feel frustrated and pressured (which is usually fun in its own way) due to lack of choices. The auxiliary deck and Odin cards open up a lot of options, making the game feel expansive.

This is one of the few games I was willing to shell out some big bucks for, being that it was OOP. Was it worth it? Overall, I would say: yes. First off, the game has great production quality. It also maintains a desirable amount of tension throughout. On the not-so-hot side, it is, like most card games, quite luck-driven. That doesn't mean there's no strategy. Certainly, this is a quintessential efficiency game (managing your hand/auxiliary deck/position). But success is still dependent on good draws. Overall, a very good game that I hope to play again soon.

Update 1/28/14: 

After a few more plays, I like this game even more. I have heard that the most important part of this game is managing your auxiliary deck. The problem is that the landscape cards change too much over the course of the game to plan out effectively. You can't be sure that what you place in your reserve is going to be needed a few turns later. Therefore, this game is, to be sure, more than a little chaotic. It's much more tactical than strategic. Nevertheless, it's really fun. It's an ultra-light, enjoyable 2 player game.

Great two player game that the wife loves to play. Each turn is a mini puzzle in how to use your cards most efficiently. This game nearly gets a 10 from me. The only reason it misses is because it can drag on too long if both players abuse the "add a card at end of turn" rule. Generally, however, the wife and I don't do this and we keep our games under a half hour. Most highly recommended.

RATING: 7
Light, just about the right length, and the "magic way" cards give you a way to hedge your bets, which is needed. Just enough decision-making for a 2-player take-your-mind-off-of-things game. But not anything that I'm going to think about afterwards.

Odin's Ravens offers a fast paced race game in which each player takes the form of a Raven and is trying to win each race on offer in order to earn 12 victory points and the favour of their master.

Each race is depicted using a range of terrain cards. Each player is then able to play cards from their hand to move over the appropriate terrain. Of course the players can manipulate the layout of the land to gain advantages of hinder their opponent and if this wasn't enough they can also vie for control of Odin's magic way.

Points are awarded for the length of victory and control of the Magic Way and multiple races are needed to reach the goal of 12 points.

This was the best game in the series for a long time and whilst Babel is up their with Odin's Ravens, it still remains the pinnacle of the series.

A semi-interesting game that does have a level of tactics and strategy but it doesn't really draw me into the game.

I will play occasionally but I'm somewhat indifferent towards the game.

Two ravens are racing over different terrain. Earn points for finishing before your opponent and earn points for having majority of cards on a certain terrain.  Players can place cards into a reserve pile, and re-use them later. The first time I played, I didn't read about extending the flight path. Lots of hand management decisions, play, and some luck, but manageable luck. I like this game, can be played with family or Eurogamers.

The idea of messenger ravens flying across landscapes in a race to be first is somewhat appealing.  However, I am not exactly sure how much luck plays in deciding the winner of the game.

Interesting 2 player game made by the same company who made Lost Cities.  A little bit more complicated than Lost, but fun for me.  My fiancee is striving to understand, but she is too small for my superior intellect (jkjk).

You are 2 wizards racing your ravens along different region cards.  You have a plethora of options to where you place your cards and that is where all your strategy stems from.  You want to make your opponent think you are up shits creek, than unload all your 'stored' cards in 2 turns and score some points.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a fun, light, race game with some depth.  It seems like there are a lot things going on, but once you start playing, it simplifies quickly.  The depth is nuanced.  As I play more, I am getting a feel for when to lengthen the race, how to set up cards for future use, and when to move myself forward rather than setting my opponent back.

I really like the small box format, making it highly portable.  I do not like that it is only 2 player as it limits its' use.

Why this is not a 10:
-> It does not have enough variability to play it all the time
-> Loser could be subject to a string of bad draws
-> Most games seem to come down to having the correct last hand
+ relatively quick - I won't turn down a match

Simple classic 2 player racing game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Light racing game. You try to gain points by getting to the finish (and having a big gap between opponent) or by discarding more of certain type of cards. You either play land cards (to move) or action cards (that give you pretty powerful actions). There is also nice small thing that you can play cards to stack to be later used (topmost first) if your hand cards don't work at all yet. Playing later from this stack is "for free". 

The game offers just enough challenge to tickle your brains a bit but it is rather light game. But short enough to be played as a filler even though there are several rounds.

I don't understand this, apparently. When we play it turns into a repetitive, grinding slog: card after card simply keeping neck-and-neck with the opponent.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (4):[/COLOR]

[i]I was almost sucked back into buying this game when the new, beautiful reprint came out. Then I remembered how light and luck driven the game was and decided to pass on it.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (4):[/COLOR]

[i]Wow, I'm glad I never acquired this game because it was a huge disappointment. The game was much lighter than I expected with very few meaningful choices. I really disliked the magic way deck which serves as a bolted on catch up mechanic (basically if you have the majority of those cards you get 3 points). 

I also don't understand how this game is always mentioned with Balloon Cup as being two of the OOP Kosmos 2p games that you should own. Maybe time has not been kind to this design with all the new 2p games out there, but Balloon Cup has. Definitely not a game I want play again.[/i]

Really great game and really beautiful game design! I know we don't play this game all the time, but when we do, we really enjoy it! This game is played in a series of short races between you and your opponent's ravens. Your raven travels along his own side of the double landscape cards! You have your own deck of cards which you will draw from and you may perform 3 actions per turn. You may simply move your raven forward, play to the magic way for bonus points, flip/switch cards using Oden cards or save cards to a seperate pile for later use. Great 2-player race game!

It's a simple race, over and over again. Nice enough, but not as special as I was hoping for. Wait for the Odin cards, extend the track if you're not getting them, put magic way landscapes on the other person's side so they're forced to use them in the race. Use your auxillliary deck for surprise. All fine and such, thought is rewarded, but is there much more to it? Lacking the pace of Lost Cities, it gets the occasional play only.

OWN Jan/05: Read the rules, and read the Magic Way corrections.

A good lighter filler.  I like the actions of playing cards and god cards.  I like how the game plays to a point total rather than just racing down the terrain, so play lasts a few hands.

The storing of terrain cards is a little messy and feels unneeded.

Another great light 2-player game.  I don't necessarily think it compares well to other racing games, but it does hold up well to other light 2-player games.

(25+ plays)

The more I play this game, the more I like it.  I really like the number of options that present themselves as you build your face down stack, extend the race, and generally try to minimize the damage done by your opponent.  There are some great racing games out there, but for two players only, this is way near the top.

One challenge however, is keeping track of the 3 up, 3 down rule.  For me, finding ways to position played cards to keep track of what I'm doing is easy.  But for the younger players, or more casual players, building a complex turn with 6 cards coming from different locations, and playing to different locations can get out of hand.  It's more than casual, but less than deep.

Has a bit of a "This could go on forever but I'll give up" feel at the ending.  Not really that much fun.

*Update* It's actually a pretty decent game.  If someone really wants to stretch it out to catch up, she can, but it typically isn't such a big deal.  Still, a couple games have ended with someone deciding to throw in the towel than having the game end more naturally.

When I first got Odin's Ravens I wasn't convinced that it'd be a good game.  I don't know why, exactly.. I guess I was still feeling burned from the purchase of Hera and Zeus, and Odin's Ravens is another one of the Kosmos 2 Player line.

Then I found myself spending a lot of time in the hospital (looking after someone else), and Odin's Ravens came along for the long hangouts in hospital waiting rooms.

After I played a few times there were some aspects of this game that stuck out as an enjoyable one:
- Small footprint.
- Easy rules.
- Random / Chance with a lot of 'screw you!" mechanisms.
- Relatively short.

Having played it at least 8 times now I can say that there's an ideal time and place for this game - sitting with a friend having a coffee, relaxing at the park (on a day that's not windy!), a quick filler with the better half or with a friend before the rest of the game group arrives.. It's not deep, it's not heavy, but it's fun and it's fast and that's why I like it.

THE MAGIC WAY
Should read...

"The six magic way cards show either two land types or one land type and a picture of Odin. At the beginning of each race, one of the cards is face up on the magic card stack.

At the end of a race, the player who has played the most cards to the face up magic way card earns bonus points. To play a card to the magic way card, a player must play a flight card without moving his raven or an Odin card without taking its action. The card played must match one of the two pictures on the magic way card (an Odin card matches the picture of Odin). The card may come from the player's hand or from his auxiliary card stack (top-most card). When a player plays a card to the face up magic way card, he places it face up next to the magic way card.

Example: at the beginning of the game, the magic way card shows Odin and a mountain. Either player may play to the card by playing any Odin card or a mountain flight card.

The player places the card played face up in the space he reserved for magic way cards. The players should overlap the cards they play to the magic way card so that they can see how many each has.

I apologize for this mistake in the rules"

This is a short 2-player card game. I put it in the same general category as Lost Cities. This one offers a little more options and decision making, although it is somewhat less balanced than LC. Furthermore, unlike LC, which has practically an infinite replayability value, Odin's can get repetative after many plays.

Cute, quick racing game for 2 players. It's a bit random in terms of what cards you draw from your symmetrical deck, but it's a nice game to kill some time, and there's some excitement when your opponent gets stuck with a bad hand. There's some complexity in the idea of being able to create a second deck you are allowed to stock and play cards from, but the mechanic winds up feeling a little cumbersome.

Enjoyment really tapered off with successive plays but have mostly played with the WRONG Magic Way rules. I had it as a 5. Definitely improved with the correct rules! However, extend, extend, extend if you're losing and don't if you're winning.  Too luck based to get cocky and go for a big score.  Some options on the Odin cards were never employed. Recently upgraded to a 7 due to proper Magic Way rule.

RATING: 9
The art in Odin's Ravens is fantastic.  I can stand to lose horribly at this game because the cards are so beautiful. In some ways, this game is about taking risks. It definitely suffers from the "this game is so deep it seems simple." I know that I will enjoy it more the more I play it, and the cards are so wonderful, I may play it until it gets to the point that I find it wonderful.

***Update****

Odin's Ravens is excellent.  The inspired Auxiliary deck makes even worthless plays worthwhile.  I get more brainburn from Odin's Ravens than I do from any other card game. One of Odin's Ravens weak points is that it needs to be played between opponents who are well matched in skill.  Usually card games use randomness to equalize players of different strengths.  Odin's Ravens does not do that, so it can be initially disappointing.  

There is a lot of player interaction too: the shifting flight path board which affects both players in a multitude of ways, the Odin Marker, even the fact that each player gets to build the board (flight path) at the end of each turn.

Odin's Ravens is a very cool little game.  It's a lot of game in a small box.

The only complaint I have is that the title implies that Odin OWNS these birds.  This is of course, not the case.  The Ravens were the FAMILIARS of Odin and he was the FAMILIAR of them.  It was a symbiotic partnership, not a matter of ownership.

Not altogether sure what to make of this one. It's very light, but it also kind of seems to play itself. Choices in your turn are usually rather obvious. Players just seem to be looking for that opening to race through and it seems to be the result of getting the right cards for the job. Hmm. I expected more. I think I'll stick with Hera and Zeus, Babel, Kahuna, Rosenkoeing and Balloon Cup in this line of games. Maybe good with the kids on holidays. Maybe.

RATING: 8
Tense, fast-paced two-player game. It's light fare, but there are definitely interesting choices you have to make. The worst part about the game is arguing about which raven is Hugin and which is Mugin. The game is played over several rounds. Points are awarded after each round, and the player who accumulates 12 points first wins. A round ends when one of the ravens completes the race. One player (or no one) win 3 points for having played the most cards to "the magic way." The race winner receives 1 point per space of their lead (worst you'll get is 1 point for a narrow victory). The race is flying over various terrain, playing cards matching the terrain in order to do so. Each player has their own terrain to cross, but they are related to each other, meaning some moves that help you may help or hurt your opponent. Two or more contiguous terrain spaces of the same kind can be traversed as if they were one space. Odin makes an appearance in this game, messing with the terrain cards, or stopping a raven for a chat. At the end of each turn you have the option of extending the flight path, which is an interesting decision. If you're behind but think you have a chance to catch up, you may want to extend the path. Or you may not, wishing to concede and cut your losses. Simple game, easy to teach, fast and fun to play.

Odin's Ravens is one of my favorite Kosmos 2-Player games. It is a tight race where every turn counts, feels rewarding and provides the player with numerous options. Winning the race is not the only way to score points and that is what makes Odin's Ravens so interesting!

RATING: 6.5
Very playable 2 player Kosmos game. Players are trying to fly their Ravens across different terrain. Cards allow players to hinder other players or boost their own progress. Balance swings back and forth quickly but poor card draw can kill a player. Very nicely made components (the long cards are unusual).

RATING: 5
Now playing with the correct interpretation of the Magic Way rules. Odin's Ravens is still hobbled by the fact that some games never seem to end. They just go on an on, and so a clever race game which should be short ends up taking as much to play as Puerto Rico. The art work is quite lovely, but the game doesn't generate enough tension for us to be very interesting.

CHILDREN'S RATING: 8.5

Odin's Ravens is a superb children's title. Don't be put off by the age 10  rating. The game can easily be simplified by removing the auxiliary and/or magic way elements, created a much more straightforward race game that even a 5 year old can grasp and excel at. Also, removing those more strategic elements appropriately handicaps the adult player - but the game retains much of its tactical flavor (so it's still fun for the adult!).

RATING: 7
Nice game!  Lots of fun, with tons of decisions each play.  Messing with your opponent is alot of fun and performing a well-planned 6 card play and moving your raven from well back in the race to the "finish line" is very rewarding.  Game can be a little long and brain bending if the two players are on top of their game and the 12 point ending sometimes feels a little abrupt and arbitrary.  Rule book also leaves some gaps.  <BR><BR>After 10-15 plays, the game begins to get a little old, so I have had to lower the score to a 7.0 from an 8.0.  Still fun to take out every once in a while, but the novelty has worn off abit.

Oh look it's Hugin in the lead, now it's Mugin by a beak, etc.  I'm not sure if you win this game because you are good at it.  It plays as a decent filler race game, the art and the pieces are pretty (with exception of the strangely two eyed Odin).  It really isn't all that outstanding though.  One of those good enough games.  At 12 points it seems to wear out its welcome, three races should be tops, esspecially as some races can  last forever and yield a one (or zero) point spread.

RATING: 7
I like this game because there are so many choices to make with every turn.  The "board" is a set of cards layed between the players depicting two parallel tracks of different landscapes.  The game is played in a predetermined number of rounds, with each round ending when a player reaches the end of the track.  Players can add cards to the end of the track, block the other player, or manipulate the sequence of landscape cards by using special power cards (Odin cards).  Cards can either be played to advance the token (river card allows movement of the token onto a river landscape), or placed into a face-down auxillary stack for use on future turns, or invested in the Magic Way, which give bonus points to the most faithful investor. 
This game can run a bit long, which is my only knock, but there are variants which reduce the length.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Best two player game I've found so far, such a simple idea but involves so much depth! 
Although my boyfriend and I ignore the rule about discarding landscape cards which are the same as we missed it when first reading the rules and prefer it without.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Really solid two player, and quite brain-burnerish at that.  The tension is intense as you can create a superturn by banking cards, but at the expense of the initiative that your opponent can use to cruise down the flight path.  There's also the bonus magic pile to get a few extra points which can serve as a nice distraction and make up for a poor performance in a race.  Overall, plenty of good decisions in this one.

Probably my favorite of the 2-player Kosmos games. Lost Cities is very good, but for the life of me I can not figure out how to win that game.

Doesn't see that many plays anymore.  I'm not that crazy about this game but I keep it because I cannot beat Emily at this game.  She's won the last dozen games of this.  She gets tremendous satisfaction rubbing that in.

Update: I was hard on this game, traded it, and then bought another copy.  Because I couldn't beat her at a young age I faulted the game as maybe not that strategic.  As the years have gone by, I have discovered my daughter is a genius at hand management games.  Reason I couldn't beat her wasn't the game, it was her being great and me not so good.  Looking forward to trying to get that elusive first win.

Odin’s Ravens is unique in its presentation and mechanic.  The cards are long and skinny which is really odd, but they are perfectly suited to the racetrack as 9 land cards are layed out in a row between the players.  Each land card is divided in two with each side having a type of land.  During the game each player plays race cards from their hand matching the terrain on the land card and moves their raven onto the matching land card.    Players take turns playing three cards form their hand and try to get their raven to the end of the racetrack.  Your score is how many spaces ahead of your opponent you are when you reach the last card.  The game is played in rounds until one player reaches 12 points  

But all is not that simple.  The player can play cards to his stack, which is sort of a bank where you can play cards form later.  The cards played from the stack don’t court against the three cards played from ypou hand and as such can make for long moves.  There is also Odin cards which add a nice dimension to the game by offering game changing types of actions like turn a land card 180 degrees, remove a land card, move your opponent back one space, and the feared move the Odin token to any space on the board (preferably right in front of your opponent), as it basically costs double to move through that space.  

To add one other element, there is “The Magic Way”, which is similar to a land card and the players have the option during  there turn to play cards to The Magic Way, and the player with the most cards in their Magic Way stack earn 3 points at the end of each round.  

All these elements add to quite a bit of strategic depth and allow for some nice tactical play.  It allows you to play defensively or aggressively, each play style has good chances of winning.  The ‘randomness’ of the cards can be a little nerveracking as you can sometimes end up with cards that don’t have much worth to the current raceway, but there seems to always be something to do whether it be play to The Magic Way or to your stack, so even bad draws don’t seem to hinder that much.  After my one play it has been added to my wishlist.  A solid 8 that I can see going up with more plays.

This has enjoyed its place in the sun, but I've played this enough by now. One of the many OK games in the Kosmos two-player series that are fun for 10-20 games, but lose replayability very fast after that. Wouldn't mind playing this again, but don't regret I traded this away, either.

[Kosmos 2002 edition] {Deity, couple, racing; hand-management} Odin's Ravens is a nice 2p game.  It's a highly tactical game with moderate depth.  Luck is controlled by having the same deck of cards for both players, flight path extension and 2 ways of scoring. The auxiliary deck is an important element of the game because it provides tactical options and planning for players. Recommended if you like tactical 2p card game.

Odin's Ravens is slightly confrontational where players can use Odin to block or add landscape cards to thwart their opponent. Actually, blocking is one important tactic of Odin's Ravens.  If your partner doesn't like any confrontation, better to avoid this game.

The theme is quite ok. Most of the rules and capabilities fit the theme nicely.  However, I think the Magic Way card is slightly artificial to provide alternative scoring to reduce luck and to let players make use of those useless cards. That is, Odin's Ravens is nicely made but not elegant enough.

There are come confusions in the translated rule. It's better to read the clarifications before playing.  I prefer the variant that only the player lagging behind may extend the flight path; this seems to balance the game better and provides another aspect of decision.

Fascinating little game that I picked up at the same time as a few other 2-player games, and after one or two plays I sort of gave it the short shrift, thinking that it wasn't as interesting or tactical as some of the other "light" 2-player offerings, and would have given it a 5 or 6.  As a result, it went unplayed after those initial games for over a year, but the number of positive comments I've seen made me pull it out recently and try it against a handful of different opponents, and I found it quite enjoyable.  It's not a 10, but it's a solid 7ish.

23 MAY 2009 - The other thing I like about this game is that you can play a couple of quick rounds and pick up later to finish a game. Great for lunch breaks or for a 'quick' game before bed with an appropriate age kid that can be continued easily later. Upped to a 10 from 9.75 -- will play it anytime, anywhere!
-------------------------------------
Love this game. Loved it the first time I played it and wanted to keep playing it. There's something I like about the variety of choices and options in playing your hand from being able to move your own raven, mess with your opponent's raven, play for extra points on the magic way, or playing into (and out of) your auxiliary pile.

It's a card game, yet so much more! Using a set of cards for the game 'board' is brilliant!

Well, this game really shocked me. I don't think I was expecting it to have so much strategy involved. It's actually quite a brain burner is its own way, combined with a bit of push-your-luck. Really enjoyable, and the artwork is beautiful. And you get to control a wooden raven - does it get any better than that?!

This game is for the birds.

It's presentation is appealing and it is fundamentally sound - although primarily it is more mental than fun.

A featherweight when it steps in the ring against most two player games - this one took a standing eight count in the early rounds and I was able to pin down a trade shortly afterward.

Nevermore.

Has held up to repeated plays better than I originally thought it might.  It fills a nice niche for 2 player games -- requires enough thought/planning that it can't just be played on autopilot like Lost Cities, but shorter and lighter than others.  Clever enough mechanics, but the Magic Way seems a bit contrived (although I see its role as a balancing mechanism).

I was definitely pleasantly surprised by this game.  I was expecting a light/fluffy/luck-based card game on the same level as Balloon Cup or Lost Cities, and while it's pretty light and luck-based, it's actually a rather fun and interesting card game.  The mechanics provide you a good deal of flexibility for turning a bad hand into a decent one given the variety of options you have, plus the artwork is pretty nice too.  Not too shabby for a $13, 30 minute card game.  If you know what you're getting into, it's a worthy addition to the Kosmos two-player line.

Good filler game for two players but very high on luck. Your hand and selection of cards is very important and will decide the outcome of the game. The length of each game is short and sweet, which makes it a good diversion.

02.2013: Reacquired original KOSMOS edition game. Still find it a really good two player game along the lines of Lost Cities and Time Square. Won't win any awards but a solid entry in the two player genre.

11.2015: Rating it a 9 primarily because all the games I have played with my spouse ended up being unbelievably exciting and down the wire. Lots of ups and downs and comeback victories. We have had 6-8 point come from behind victories. Nothing is final until finish line is crossed. Sure, luck plays a hand in victories but nonetheless, an excellent 2p filler.

I thought this was a really nice race game.  Some races seemed to be over too fast.  I started extending the course in later turns, but that seems risky.  It might give the player in back a chance to catch up, or it might just increase the score difference.  Things were going well in the game until I blocked Terri with a raven, and after she burned 3 cards to clear it, I moved her back again.  She wasn't happy.  We'll see if the game comes out again.

Quick and fun. There is certainly lots of luck but there is also a small amount of strategy and you need to optimise your moves. The odin marker is really annoying though, so probably not good for those who dislike 'take that' games.

At first I thought this was a competitive game but after repeated plays, I realized that this is a pretty fun 2-player filler game. While you're a slave to the card draw, the game still forces you to make some decisions with the use of auxiliary stack and the Magic Way.

The more I play this game, the harder it gets ... which isn't a bad thing!  There's something very satisfying about organizing a turn based on your hand, your face-down cards, and your position in the race.  I've figured out many of the subtleties of the game, and now making some of the decisions is agonizing.  Someone once beat me 14-11 after holding me at those eleven points for two rounds!

My first and only KickStarter scam.
A fairly well documented case of 'take the money and run'

a reasonably priced copy of the original printing.
It took almost two years before I found a copy where the price met my expectations.

Played a few times. A nice two-player game with an interesting hand management mechanism (which I don't think has been used enough in my games - maybe because of our lack of experience?).

Pros: short, fast AND clever filler that is actually much deeper than it seems. Also, no dices all you need is a deck of cards and a few coins so it's brilliant for taking it out for a trip.
Cons: lot of shuffling + it may take some space on the table - the  cutting of the flight-line (recommended in the rules) shortens the number of options (swapping landscapes), so don't do it.

Watching your opponent's raven flying on makes you feel a lot pissed :). The race is usually tense to the last moment.

A bit long and repetitive for what it is.  Odin's Ravens does pose a couple of interesting choices during each turn, but most of them will be pretty straightforward.  Not a bad 2-player for the casual crowd, but offers very little for the hardcore gamer.

Fast, fun, two-player game. You are both Odin's ravens, racing to the finish. I don't know why - don't ask questions. There's a certain amount of Mario Kart "throw a shell at your opponent" strategy here and... that's about it - in other words, not a lot. I don't remember this being based on chance? But it wasn't particularly complicated or strategic either. A decent time-killer game between longer games. Obviously, I like the theme. Also, I remember this being VERY hard to get for a time - I think I bought it because it was going out of print, or it was only available like in Iceland or something, and then it got re-printed like several years later.

Los ravens compiten entre ellos a lo largo de una pista hecha de las tarjetas que representan diversos tipos de tierra. Los jugadores juegan a las cartas que coinciden con los tipos de la tierra para poder mover sus ravens. Hay también las cartas de Odin que permiten que el jugador cambie la pista de las cartas del paisaje y también afectar al otro jugador.

RATING: 9
First play was on 9/9 at our GenCan't conference.  It was a 3 player game and it indeed took a while to explain and get started with the game.  I would definitely like to play this again with the same 3 people and possibly introduce 1 more new player.  There is a lot to think about during this game, the game seems to play fast and there is a ton going on.  I didn't have a clear strategy going into the first play, but about halfway through the game I found a strategy that paid off big!  Time to give it another try.  This is a very satisfying game, but you have to find the right type of people to play it with.

Played once with four players.
German game, supposedly themed during the Industrial Revolution (but could be anything).
Players take the role of  "clever" industrial Tycons (!)
Pwan/Workman  placement, pwan/workman sacking, open a factory, close an assembly line, regulate selling prices and calculate your market attractiveness to have the maximum profit and see that profit evaporate with wages payment ... Bofff. 
Boy, people don't get tired to play the same thing!!
No story, no drama, no plot ... only accounting mechanics .... BOOORING and too long for what it offers!
It requires capacity for FAST and competent accountancy.

Nice components.

Reserving full judgement until I get to play the full game, but since I don't know if that will ever happen I will at least jot something down now. We played a Spinning Jenny game at bgg.con 2015, and it was an undertaking. The rulebook is a little daunting, and isn't organized particularly well, and this coupled with the misprints on the player boards (which we were initially unaware of) made us really confused for the first 30 mins.  The way the economy works in SJ was interesting, but seemed like it lacked a lot of tension. We used the recommended first time set up which probably contributed to this somewhat, but the markets were divided between players and there was very little over production. When I tried to muscle my way into a third market I was soundly punished for it and never had the money to make it work. In a full game with a couple extra decades I could see this potentially working better, but here it just cost me the game. Also, even as someone who doesn't play 18XX, it feels VERY weird that buying or selling stocks doesn't affect your stock value. As such the stock price feels like a very uninspired system. 
Very, very interested in playing waterframe and seeing how the overall game system expands, but would probably not want to play spinning jenny ever again.

RATING: 6.5
Very complex. Not good for 2 players. Too punishing for first players in a given round because other players can adjust their prices and appeal in succession. The water frame option mitigates some of this problem but shipping is hard to do - it seems you pretty much have to decide to specialize in it right from the start.

I enjoyed playing Arkwright for the first time with four players.  I liked playing with the actions, the purchasing and upgrading of factories, mechanizing to save money, and producing and selling goods such that my stock value went up as much as possible.  

On the other hand, truth be told, I am not a particularly fervent fan of hard core financial games. In a certain sense, I feel about Arkwright as I do about the game Automobile.  Both are very well designed, financial "grind out a profit or fail" games, but both are just not high on my "want to play again" list.  Is that how I want to spend my game time?  Not particularly.  On the other hand, if you love "grind out a profit or fail" games, you should definitely try Arkwright.

Nothing pretty to look at and a real bitch to explain but a pretty interesting competitive optimization game. Unfortunately the complexity of it means that you have to re-learn this beast of a game if you're away from it for too long. This pretty much kept it off the table for us and we eventually decided to just sell it to make room for other games that would get played more often.

The supply and demand market is pretty slick, but the game as a whole is overwrought. The real game is in the market, but the gaminess of the administrative costs in addition to the special ability synergies and random events/market adjustments just waters it down and adds significant parsing overhead.

From what I understand, the Spinning Jenny version does away with the shipping (the dominant strategy in Waterframe) as well as the special abilities and event tiles. That might be a game worth playing.

RATING: 6
Spinning Jenny (short game) twice, Waterframe thrice (~$350 3p SJ, $252 [12x$21] 4p SJ; $720 [30x$24] 3p WF, ~$650 [26x$25 estimated] 4p WF, $644[28x$23] (winner was 30x$24) 4p WF:

Very conflicted.

Summary:
It's an advanced Third World Debt crossed with Age of Steam.  This is the game I wanted Brass to be.  It's simultaneously the best parts of Rolling Stock crossed with the worst parts of 1846.


I was initially a bit concerned that the game would be another "find the inflection point to trade money into points" game where everyone falls under a similar path and are simply optimizing.  The path exists, but there are other routes - and the focus is generally more about calculations of early "debt" to maximize late points.  Everything is about finding the optimal squares.

I never felt the game was really punishing me for issuing too many early shares, I would have liked to see a bit more there - issuing shares losing share price perhaps, or some sort of dividend expectation.  To the contrary, it seems likely that having the extra flexibility of $150 (or nearly $150) outweighs the ~$20 potential lost endgame value, particularly given that you must take a capitalization action "early" to get contracts - you can repurchase excess shares for a small premium then.

I'm concerned that upgrading factories is a dominant choice to the extent that all players should be upgrading their factories as soon as possible - although this does not preclude that some paths are dominant, simply that they all require this upgrade.  I'm also concerned that the scores will wind up being very same-y ($720 on first play out of $900 max indicates that "real" winning scores will frequently be in the ~$800 range for 3p and ~$700 for 4p), and that small variance dictated by chaos and randomness will be larger than the deltas efficient players can make through direct interaction.  Some of the (superficially complex) development tiles seem to be underpowered, but more experimentation might prove them viable.  It looks like by the III factories you should *always* have each factory, they earn profit beyond the lost capital in one go.

I really like the interaction of the demand, workers, and appeal.  The minigame each player faces in action selection bureaucracy is not interesting.

My "advance knowledge" variant, at least for events, seems a necessity to not get randomly screwed by an event.  Events as a whole are a negative to the design.  If one considers the strategic space present with no events, then what it looks like with the events, the events simply constrain and reduce the strategic space in random directions while providing some garbage sense of "variation" between instances.  I'm considering refusing to play with them in the future.

The development tiles seem worryingly unbalanced - inventor and charisma are "must-gets" which will be grabbed in the initial round by p4 and p3, respectively, while the extra good tile seems almost complete rubbish until the late game.  Most of the others seem fair if not boring for the extra bit of parsing they force onto the player.

Heavy automation is a must, we are racing up to $5/worker within the first turn.

Ultimately, the game asks a few interesting questions which I'm concerned are roughly solvable within the randomness and chaos present.  Should that seem to truly be the case, rating will drop to 2-3; should there instead only prove to be some unbalanced elements, probably 5ish; and if the game seems to actually allow for the full range of options with consistently interesting deltas between players that it promises, 9ish.  After a few plays, it's looking like it's heading towards a 5.

RATING: 8.75
Arkwright is not a title for everyone. It is long, somewhat fiddly, prone to AP, has a higher learning curve than most games and the setup is lengthy. That said, [b]it is my top game of 2014![/b] The rules are mostly straightforward, but getting through the rulebook can be somewhat daunting at first. Once you pass the hurdle which is the rulebook, it is somewhat akin to the old board game adage: "Simple rules, but hard to master." At least IMHO! I found the game very interactive and extremely engaging.

 It takes a couple of games under your belt to fully understand what is going on. It definitely shines with experienced and competent players. Your first game will probably be more of a rules absorption and interpretation. Your subsequent games will probably be more interactive as you are trying to implement your strategies while dealing with your opponents.

The goal of the game is to have the most valuable stock portfolio. The value is determined by the amount of stocks in your possession multiplied by the current share value. That means that during the game you will be trying to buy more stocks (limited to 30) while attempting to increase their share value. A task easier said than done! You start the game with 15 shares, but must sell some of them to pay for your initial factories and also to have money left over to pay for administration charges; also known as paying for your actions.

So where do you get the money to buy the shares? Well, this is the crux of the game. You are trying to run factories efficiently to produce goods so that you may sell them to England or to the foreign market. Now with that said, you are also competing with the other players for the ability to sell these goods. You can be undermined by another player(s)'s goods being more appealing to the market and essentially they sell their goods before you can if the demand is in short supply. This could leave you in a dire situation because you need to sell the goods to pay for the workers and machines in your factory and hopefully have some money left over for administration charges (paying for your actions) and to buy more shares of your stock.

So how do you increase your share price? Well, by selling goods and/or by having the most appealing goods and/or by selling the most goods. This is where the interaction with the other players shine in this game because by manipulating the quality, marketing and prices of their goods, a player can dictate where they stand in the market share table. In other words, players are competing to sell their goods on the market and by not being competitive they may sell fewer or no goods which translates into your stock share value not increasing.

There is also an external foreign market that you can sell goods to via shipping, but at the negative impact of your share values decreasing or not increasing via the process stated above. 

One of the interesting and enjoyable aspects of the game is trying to decide which road to take for your strategy. Initial factories that are bought by other players and yourself and the prices of their goods can be a guideline to determine which type of plan you are pursuing. There are multiple strategies available and the Player's Book has some listed and explained. It seems that you want to do what your opponent is not doing, but with options being limited and tight interaction will ensue.

For example, I recently tried a shipping strategy that made me a lot of money which led me to purchase all 30 of my stocks, but in the process it left my shares with little value. Another player with fewer stocks but higher share value won the game. I did not time my decision from making money and buying stocks to being competitive in the market and thus raising my share value correctly. I took too long to switch strategies and lost, but I had a great time while pursuing it.

I've also tried the strategy of just concentrating on two factories. The specialist strategy! By the end of the game, my two factories were maxed out in quality and distribution and I was selling goods and increasing my share value rapidly. Unfortunately, I was too inefficient and I spent too much money in upgrading my factories which left me little money to buy more shares in the end. My share values were high, but my stock shares were few... The highlight of that plan was watching one of my opponents closing one of his factories that was directly competing with me because it was losing money.

So all of this said, what is it that I like about Arkwright?
 
1. Player Interaction. What I find the most engaging and interesting about the game is implementing your plan while interacting with your opponents. It is not easy to follow your plan and at the same time trying to hinder your opponents. What development tile (tiles that give you advantages or break the rules) am I going to choose that plays to my plan while hindering my opponent? Should I play a Charisma tile to change turn order so that I can be the last to manipulate the price of my goods and therefore hamper my opponents plans?

2.Interesting Choices. I love the angst of the choices that need to be made. From choosing the right development tiles to what price am I adjusting my goods. Should I open up a new factory and compete there or should I concentrate on the ones that I have built and make them more competitive? When do I switch from a shipping strategy to being more competitive in the market to raise my share prices? Should I buy stocks in the beginning of the game when they are cheaper and money is tighter or should I wait towards the end when they are the most expensive?

3. Innovative design. I love the design choices and how everything makes sense and works together.

4. Art style. I know this is subjective, but I love how the graphic style enhances the theme. I don't know what it is about Spielworxx's games, but I love their art style.

Arkwright is presently my top game for 2014. It is not easy to get to the table because you need the right group, but when you do and the players are experienced, it is an enjoyable and charming experience. Dare I say that it is fun too?

I have only played Spinning Jenny thus far but am already enamored.  This is a strategy-loving, forward planning dream.  It also has a rule book that sucks to learn from -- a teacher will ease the pain.  But given that Waterframe will add considerably more to think about and do, I'm pretty sure my rating will only rise.

Update: Bumped it to a 9.

It didn't really work for us. There was a 2 hours long learning curve for the team, then the game itself took almost 7 hours to play.. After two hours I have realized, that it was not the best tactic to play with, but it was too late, and for another 5 hours I was really suffering behind the others with no real options to get back on track... The employee market didn't work too - after two rounds the workers gone, there was nobody to hire. It really felt like the game was broken.

Very interested in playing this to experience the heavy economic business competition. 

Update: Played the Spinning Jenny version and enjoyed it. There was a lack of variety for my tastes in the SJ version, but the way the mechanisms worked was quite interesting and thematic. I also can greatly improve my performance since I ran out of money in the end! I'm looking forward to the Waterframe version to add a little more variability and "room to play".  Initial rating based on the Spinning Jenny version alone. I hope that it goes up when I experience the full game.

Update 2: I played a 4 player game of the Waterframe version. I enjoyed it more than the Spinning Jenny version, because it felt like there was more variety to the pathways that each player went down. A few of the players felt strongly that shipping contracts are very overpowered and necessary to win the game. From this one play it certainly seems that it is a very difficult strategy to beat, due to the huge influx of money in the early game. In our game the player that shipped and timed their switch back to fulfilling England demand won by a huge margin. The player that didn't ship at all lost the game. Overall I enjoyed aspects of the game, but didn't really love it. Maybe I would enjoy it more with less downtime, but as of now I think it is an alright game masked behind a its heaviness.

Modern "run good companies" euro with players competing in the market for domestic sales and (potentially) selling excess production overseas at the cost of share price.  Special powers change strategies from game to game.   

There's a couple of interesting pieces:
1. Players need to both acquire more shares of their company (at current share price) and grow their share price.  Timing the two is tricky and makes the game interesting.  The "purchase other players' shares" expansion dilutes that.
2. Like Vinhos, ultimately it's about selling goods and players need to expand past the two industries they start in.  However, figuring out when and how is tough and the right answer varies from game to game.

RATING: 8.5
Se trata de un juego económico ambientado en la revolución industrial. Se desarrolla en cuatro décadas desde 1770 a 1820 en las que los jugadores tendrán que gestionar sus fábricas (pan, ropa, cubertería y lámparas) y procurar vender su producción, o bien exportarla.
El objetivo es conseguir dinero para con él, comprar acciones de la propia compañía. Gana el juego quien, al final, tiene mayor valor de la compañía (el número de acciones por el valor de la acción al final del juego).
Es denso de reglas y tiene muchos detallitos que hacen que la explicación se vaya más allá de la hora. Se considera un juego pesado, y está dirigido a jugones. No apto para aficionados ocasionales. 
Tiene duración larga (cinco horas), pero muy buena experiencia de juego. Recomendable, solo para jugones.

Spinning Jenny (the 'basic' game) was a bit footery and clocked in not much under 3 hours which is a bit on the long side but there are tantalising promises of depths to be explored once you're up to speed. Pretty brutal, even with relatively small errors, in a similar way to Age of Steam so if you like that sort of thing this may well be for you.

Don't judge a book by its cover. I was never was really interested by Arkwright due to its rather bland presentation and uninspiring theme. Once you get past that, and its overwhelming table presence, it is quite a good game. I especially loved the interaction between appeal and demand to determine how many goods each player can sell. The various asymmetrical power tiles are also a nice touch to ensure that each game will play out differently. My biggest complaint is that it seems like the winner is simply going to be the player with the most shares; the difference between share value is not big enough to make up for having a share or two less. Definitely need to play it more to develop a better strategy!

Excellent. One of the most dynamic and integrated game designs. 

I love that what other players do in the market changes what you should be doing in the same market. 

The development tiles are great and help push different strategies. 

Do you set the price of your good lower than everyone else and raise your stock value. Or do you ship, dropping your stock value, but gaining a lot of money and buy more stocks at a lower price, then attempt to raise your stock value toward the end?

Well-I honestly thought with all my ranting and raving about how terrible the "Archipelago" and "Robinson Crusoe" rulebooks were-that no one would ever make a bad rulebook again.

WRONGO!!

This "rulebook" is a bonifide piece of SHIT. I have taken DAYS, taken extensive notes, drawn diagrams, and I am not even CLOSE to 1/2 thru "Jenny" (the far simpler of all the versions). 

The idiots that put together this "rulebook" are clueless as to how to explain a game to someone.

3 separate rulebooks and does even ONE have a list of all the peices and what they are called? NOPE. Go figure that out yourself. They will tell you to put a factory in "the appropriate space" but NEVER tell you what "the appropriate space" might POSSIBLY refer to. Then, 8 pages or so in? a full page 'graphic' whose sole purpose (as best I am able to determine) is showing one how to subtract one integer from another.

WTF?????????????

Is the game any good? WHO HAS ANY IDEA?

Total piece of shit rulebooks like these produce little pockets around the world of gamers who "decided to play it this way"-meaning there are hundreds of ways people have dealt with non-rulebooks, but there is no real consensus "game" per se-exact same sitch as "Archipelago" and Robinson Crusoe"...I want my money back.

Wooohooo! Does not get better than this game for economic engine building.

Learnt the game in a long sitting 2 player game (5.5hrs) but went straight to Water Frame so jumped in at the deep end and worth it as now have the rules and play pretty much well understood and will be straight forward to teach. The depth lies in the strategy and complexity is setting your pricing/appeal at the the right levels to get the most return in both the UK market and foreign markets, when you go that route.

Such a good game and would like to try with 3 players next to see the differences in choices as well as what it does for gameplay/strategy v a 2 player game.

I loved everything that I saw in this game. Every decision is interconnected with everything else. Raise the quality of your goods, that impacts price and demand. Hire more workers to make more goods, that changes how much you pay in labor and the size of the market. Want to get more plays of Spinning Jenny in and then start working towards Waterframe.

As four experienced gamers we decided to play the Waterframe version.  Our first game took about 6 hours but it was a fantastic 6 hours.  Hard to teach but not hard to play, but maybe hard to play well.  One player thought it was a bit to long but she still enjoyed the game.  I thought this was one of the best games I've ever played.  I might bump the rating up after another play.

One player, we will call him Scott so you won't know who it really was, enjoyed calling us bastards when we fired workers and placed their tokens in the dejected box.

Second game with one new player, 5 hours.
Third game with three new players, 3.5 hours.

First play of Water Frame, and rating down from 10 to 9.5. The Development Tiles add both a pleasing level of complexity and a strategic element to the game, while making the Advanced Action Tiles -- and thus your action options -- tighter, but shipping didn't feel totally balanced. This may have been more a factor of the 3-player game however, especially with only one player focusing on shipping, and so not having to compete for options/opportunities. (September 2016)

Highlight: 2016 (August 2016)

A truly outstanding game, with an impressive density of decisions for the playtime. (July 2016)

Not nearly as complex as I thought it would be. Each turn consists of choosing one main action from 6 or so choices, and then one of two secondary actions. The organization (not the wording) of the rulebook is the biggest obstacle. Explanations don't progress from high-level to detail. Often edge cases are explained before universal points. That said, the rulebooks are comprehensive. I think they would have benefited from a GMT-style outline format, but then I generally think that...

After 5 plays I feel like I'm getting a sense of the possibilities. Arkwright shares much in common with Planet Steam, which I also love, but it is a much more civilized experience. There is still ample opportunity for aggression, but there are workarounds; you can always react and find a workaround. 

Arkwright continues to be a very satisfying game. If you have the time, and you like to think things through and plan ahead, this is a game I highly recommend.

This is a great game. Got to try it out twice at Origins and played the beginner suggested play and then played water frame the next day. Lots of options for each turn. Simple to do, complex enough to change up strategies from play to play. Really enjoyed this and will have to buy it.

Must play 4-5 more times before giving a real rating. The game is obviously hugely dense and super interlocked, and so it was very overwhelming for our first play. Probably gets very good after I get a handle on the game, but it's a struggle to get there.

Such a fantastic game.
And then the export market ruins it.
Man, we so liked it, but in the last third of the game, it became clear that the only way to go was to switch to export completely, leaving the domestic market to the government. So frustrating, as that was the really interesting part...

This made it feel too scripted to us, which is why it fell flat, unfortunately. We so wanted to love this game completely...

Heavy game with a lot of options. Optimize your economy and use your profit to buy your shares back from the bank.
The Waterframe scenario takes the whole night, probably the Spinning Jenny is playable in two/three hours.

Update: after a couple of plays I discover even more strategies and tactics which make the game even better. I prefer this over 18xx which has about the same playing time.

2nd ed.   Plays well w two but better with three.  (There is an extra, game-controlled player regardless of the number of actual players so even with 2p there are three in the market.). This game has depth but it is really not that complex.  There is one part (where the sales and cost dollars yields unit #s) that's not the usual accounting logic so it takes a min to understand -- but it works.  This game comes together really well.  The second Ed goes a long way towards making it more accessible with different versions which each layer on a bit of complexity and interest.  Just a really good version of what it is designed to do.

Amazing game, looking forward to every opportunity I have to explore the system more. Will never turn down a game of this.

Playing predominantly with 2 players, shipping is less of a factor and there can potentially be a lack of competition across the goods. But, this is player controlled and can play substantially differently depending on early choices made by the players. Higher player counts add to the length of the game, but there is a greater level of competition and positioning yourself in turn order can be game changing. Love it at all player counts.

Capstone additions add more variety without drastically altering the game, and slightly open up options in a positive way.

Components: they are good, no exceptional, but really good
Complex: this is a heavy game, the rules are not so hard to explain if you find someone who controls them, otherwise the explanation could be a nightmare
Weight: heavy
Players: 4 (could be 3)
Length: less than 3 hours
Mechanics: all about pricing and selling
Decisions: a lot, from clothes wearing to the game to when to pause for bath
Opinion: too much to say about this game, great economic game with tough decisions and good flow.
We are in the 19th Century, and you have to manage your industry in England, you have 4 different type of industries and a very aggressive market to deal with.
About the rules, they can seem overwhelming you, but they are not so much, if you are lucky and can be explained by someone doing it well, the first game will be delicious (imagine the rest). Lot of things going on, but all of them very well interconnected.
You play through 5 decades, with 4 cycles each, one for each resource. In each of the cycles you execute one action, which could be for any of them, though the cycle will only work for the current one. Then the sell phase, with a nice fight and the check of the appealing of what you sell (depending on the quality and the price). Oh! and then you have the option to sell to the India, with tons of profit but bad for your shares.
Did I mention this is an economic game? Everything is for your shares, only yours, no option to buy from the rest of players. At the end of the game, the one who has higher profit with this shares will be the winner, and their value will be affected by selling (up), India (down) and emergency sells (down).
Finishing this, because I could talk longer and longer, this is an amazing economic game, playable in less than 3 hours with everything very well interconnected, what you are doing now will affect what you do 3 turns later.
Simply love it

Excellent heavy game.  It takes alot of time to learn this game from the rulebooks but its totally worth it!
There is so many choices!
You can build/modernize factories, improve quality in your factories, make marketing for a temporary boost, hire worker to produce more, replace worker with machine to save money, get contracts buy or sale shares, ship and produce!
I really love how you set the price of your goods.  You can set it low to sell more goods and make your share value go higher faster or set the price high to sell less and ship the rest if you have a boat and a matching contract (if you don't you will lose your goods unless you have worker in the warehouse).
There is also development tiles that give special power but you can only have 4!

Big thank you to Tony and Edward from Heavy Cardboard podcast for putting this game on my radar!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
(01/24/2015) Comment based on 3 plays of Spinning Jenny, and 1 play of Spinning Mule.

This is a GREAT economics game simulating the "feel" of the dawn of the industrial revolution in England in the 1760s to early 1800s. Players each control privately held holding companies, each with subsidiaries in up to four different markets, attempting to produce goods, increase market share, improve productivity and efficiency, and most importantly increase shareholder value. Being privately held, players buy and sell stock of their [i]own[/i] conglomerate, sort of like Berkshire-Hathaway shares, where the stock price moves up based on the collective performance of each of their four industries (i.e, food, clothes, cutlery, and lamps). There is stiff competition for improving one's stock relative to the others, by ensuring your industries are selling the most products by having the highest appeal in terms of quality, distribution, and lowest price. This is balanced against keeping production costs low and maximizing profitability, so as to not go and sell stock to raise cash.

As far as presentation goes, this is comparatively dry to most Euros, where the player tableaus and game board look more like spreadsheets. The artwork is definitively "industrial", with a worn and heavy look to it, adding to the charm and theme of the game. Where the game lacks in pretty, colorful artwork, it shines most brilliantly in the gameplay and mechanics. In short, everything in this game works together in a most intriguing and natural way, with the resulting "feel" being very economic. Everything you've learned in Econ 101 is in play here, with Supply and Demand, as well as the elusive quality of "Appeal", which dictates whose goods get sold first, as well as those who make the most profit. It is very business-like, with critical decisions every turn, as you aspire to optimize your conglomerate relative to your competitors. A small mistake could be devastating in the long run, as this game is not very forgiving. You may not notice at first, like other economic games, but you soon learn to spot and regret that ill-fated executive decision you made a decade ago. Thus, this game is very thematic in that sense.

In terms of game mechanics, most of them are fairly familiar. What is impressive in this design is how all of the pieces have been tightly interwoven, to give so much variety, for so little action. There are only 12 actions in the introductory Spinning Jenny game, making each action very important and having significant repercussions for the rest of the game. Each player has access to six basic actions: 1) Buy Machinery, 2) Improve Quality, 3) Improve Distribution, 4) Stock Market, 5) Industry, 6) Workers. He must choose one and place it on one of five administrative spots, each with increasing cost ranging from £2 to £10. For the first three action types, the more he pays, the more possibilities for improvement he gets for increasing the appeal and profitability of his produced goods. However, the basic actions are not very efficient. There are advanced action tiles that are more efficient, but they can only be obtained by playing any of the other remaining actions and then claiming the advanced tile though a "special action". Once an action tile is placed, it cannot be displaced for a game turn (a decade), but it can be reactivated by paying for it again and additional fee of £2.

With Industry, a player can build a new factory in a new industry, close one, or modernize. With Workers, he can hire or fire workers that man his factories. With the Stock Market, he can sell shares to raise money, or buy back shares for end of game scoring (where share price x number of shares is the VP, where money does not count except for tie breaking), as well as sell goods at base price. With Machines, the player can replace workers with inexpensive machines (much like the automatons in Leonardo Da Vinci), because the workers tend to get expensive with increasing labor rates. With Quality, he can permanently improve the quality, and thus the appeal of a good or several goods. With Distribution, he can temporary, but relatively inexpensively improve the appeal of a good or several. In all three actions, he can then as a "special action", adjust the price and/or appeal of the good for a given industry.

The "appeal" concept is the heart of the economics in Arkwright. It is based on the base quality of the good (dictated by the cost of the factory) + Quality + Distribution - Price. The base quality ranges from £8 to £11 for the four starting industries (and the factory "tech levels" improve with time), where food is the cheapest (and lowest quality) and lamps are the most expensive (and highest quality). The quality and distribution can be jacked up by the action tiles discussed previously. Thus, the player has an interesting choice in setting price--he can set for high appeal and low price (think Walmart's strategy) or low appeal and high prices. The rub is that there is a fluctuating, somewhat unpredictable, but relatively stable demand created by the labor market (from where the workers are drawn). Goods with higher appeal sell first in satisfying demand, and then they are sold off one good at a time with progressively lower appeal goods selling later, similar to the mechanic in Automobile where newer cars sell first. This is also similar to the price setting/goods selling mechanic in Ground Floor. The fact that cheaper priced goods have higher appeal and sell before more expensive goods is similar to the discounting cylinders used in Automobile. The balancing act is receiving enough cash, despite the discounting, so that you can pay your workers and generate a profit. If he is unable to sell goods because of low appeal, they are stored in a warehouse, much like the wind rose in Puerto Rico (but you can store up to five goods). They can be tried to be sold at full price in a subsequent decade, or sold at base price in a stock market action.

The other half is of production which determines the supply side. Each factory for each industry has significantly different production capabilities and labor/machinery requirements. The food industry is relatively easy to produce many goods, and requires the fewest labor. By sharp contrast, the lamp industry produces the fewest goods, but requires the most labor. Correspondingly, the demand for lamps is less than food. However, because the base quality of lamps is much higher than food, the player can set a higher price. In the long run, lamps are far more profitable, although they are more expensive to produce in terms of labor cost. Still, with the Machinery action, players can fire workers and replace them with cheap to maintain machines. In this manner, they can significantly reduce the production cost.

The demand side is determined by the labor market, where the workers are hired from. As more workers are hired, the demand for goods from each of the four industries goes up at a relatively stable rate. Further, as more workers are hired, the labor rate goes up at discrete intervals from £2 to £5. Each cycle (there are four "cycles" per "turn" or decade) a number of workers return from a "fired workers" pool to somewhat adjust labor and demand. As the game progresses, as players build into other industries (other than the original two they start the game with) and improve their factories, the supply begins to outstrip the demand. Players then must fight to improve the appeal of their goods, by adjusting quality, increasing distribution, and/or improving their factories. As factories improve, more labor is required, which increases demand and labor costs. The players also try to improve profitability by adjusting prices in relation to appeal, as well as mechanizing their factories with machines.

Each turn (decade) is broken up into four cycles, dealing specifically with one industry good in each cycle. Players may take any action affecting the current cycle, and/or actions that affect other industries outside of the current cycle. In each cycle, the supply and demand is calculated, the goods sold for cash, labor/machine costs paid, and the stock price adjusted. The stock movement is eerily similar to most 18XX games. However, the game represents privately held companies, so they cannot own stocks of the other players' conglomerates or even attempt to manipulate them. Sell one good and your stock moves up one space. Sell two or more goods and your stock moves up two spaces. Sell the most and get another bump. Have the highest appeal and you get yet another bump. All in all, if you have a factory in a given industry, your stock could jump up to four spaces on the stock track in each cycle. If cash is needed, an emergency sale of share(s) is made, decreasing the stock by a number of spaces dependent on location on the track, much similar to Brass and taking loans.

And this is just the Spinning Jenny (SJ) rules!

The Spinning Mule (SM) introduces a random economy (where importation and labor refresh rates vary) and event (something random, but historically appropriate) tiles, as well as an fairly large assortment of development tiles.

The Water Frame (WF) rules introduces even more random range of economic fluctuation and more event tiles, as well as the full set of development tiles. It also introduces shipping, which gives even more options and variability to the players.

The SJ rules are clearly written. However, it did take two hours for a cold read through on our first play, with gameplay taking over 3 hours. There are some portions where the German to English translation takes more than several readings to make sense, and we got a good chunk of rules wrong on our first several plays. Subsequent teachings of the SJ rules took 35 minutes and play coming down to just over 2 hours. A cold read and set up of the SM rules took 1 hour, especially going over the new development tiles. It didn't help that we had to look up portions of the WF rules, as well as a third Players Guide book! Play took 3.5 hours, but we suspect it will drop with repeated plays. WF is another matter.

With this rich and dense ruleset, it is highly recommended to start with SJ and work your way up to the WF rules. As SJ is perfect information, with no random elements, it becomes fairly predictable and same-y after a few plays. The SM ruleset begins to add the unpredictable nature of a true market economy, along with some rule-breaking development tiles that give players interesting choices. We are looking forward to playing with the full WF rule set, but it has been enjoyable discovering the various layers of SJ and SM rulesets. As said before, the mechanics strongly and faithfully convey the sense of supply and demand economics, where every decision has consequences that make realistic sense as one would predict in the real world. In that regard, I don't think any other economic game has come close to what Arkwright has achieved. So, kudos to the designer for putting together a game that makes economic sense! Our group loves the game, as there is much to discover and savor, and we are looking to many more plays. It is a solid "9" coming out of the gate, with room to go up to a "10". We will see with Water Frame.

I've only played Spinning Jenny (the shorter version), so I don't know the true extent of this game. The version I played is long but not that hard to wrap your head around; it's very much a game about choosing in which areas you want to stay one step ahead of your opponents.  Would certainly be interested in playing the more complicated version. (1 play)

Arkwright is undeniably a well-designed game with some clever concepts, particularly how product demand and worker supply are related.  Gameplay is math intensive and requires constant calculations all the time.  Miscalculations can be punishing.   Ultimately, I respect this game, but I'm unsure how much fun I have playing it.

Really cool game. There are a lot of moving parts and a lot of important decisions all through the game. The special power tiles and the upgraded versions of the actions are really cool, as is the opportunity for lucrative but stock weakening shipping contracts. The way you choose actions every round is simple but interesting, and the way the market works to determine labor prices and demand for goods is brilliant. It just seems like there are so many possibilities in this game.

The only potential downside is the fact that the game seems to encourage a lot of calculating out possibilities, which might make the game drag. Though I enjoyed this aspect.

And it really makes you care what your opponents are doing, there's a decent possibility for really aggressive moves which is why turn order is so important and in particular being able to choose turn order can be really powerful. It's a lot of fun just figuring out what you can afford to do to make your factories run better and see them work but really the best parts are the price wars that can develop over goods and figuring out how many you'll need to/be able to sell, and figuring out how big of a shipping contract you can afford to make. Any round where opponents could set their prices after me I was watching with a lot more intensity than I ever have in most games.

Man. I really like it, but it kind of becomes a slog halfway through the fourth or fifth hour. Trying to teach is brutal. It takes a good 20 minutes just to put it away, and even longer to set it up.

We played Spinning Jenny once but I think if you're going to go through the trouble you might as well do Waterframe.

At last I got to buy this fabled game. I hope to play it soon. For now I can say that I’m disappointed with some of the game components. For the high cost of the game, I expected better quality. When punched out many of the tiles were damaged, other tiles are smeared with some kind of black ink.

Arkwright should have had a clear list of components, naming the components isn’t enough if you haven’t played the game and the player`s handbook doesn’t list them in a way easy to find. Verifying that everything was in the box was very time consuming AND it seems I’m missing 4 player aids for the Spinning Jenny game variant.

Arkwright was one of the games my game group and I had a very high desire to play, after playing it that desire hasn’t abated :D.

First of all, I have only played the Spinning Jenny version, so all my comments are discussing this, I hope to play the Water Frame version soon.

The theme isn’t exciting for me, however the game is good enough that I can ignore it. Having saying that, the theme, although not to my liking (as with most euros), fits very well within the game and it doesn’t impacts negatively on the game.

My first impression (and my friend´s) after finishing the game was “that’s it?”. I was expecting a very heavy and long game and Arkwright isn’t that heavy or that long (at least on its Spinning Jenny version), however I really liked what I saw. In fact I feel the game ended way too quickly. We played with the preset setup so we only played it for three decades, that means you only have 12 main actions during the whole game. I’m very keen on playing the full game soon (I think in that configuration Arkwright could be indeed a long game).

The rules aren’t that hard either, the problem is that there are many rules. Having three game manuals isn’t ideal for me. I read the Spinning Jenny one but I didn’t understood some terms until I read the Player´s handbook, however the Player´s handbook explains the game in terms of the Water Frame edition, so it can be confusing. Also there were some parts in which the game manuals repeated themselves. It also is hard to verify the list of components if you don’t know them. All of this is a minor quibble for me.

As soon I read the rules, I feel the game was comparable to Tesla vs. Edison. The final goal is the same (buying shares) but the games are very different in game mechanics (Arkwright is the superior game in every regard). 

Arkwright isn’t a cheap game, so for that reason I’m disappointed with the general quality of the game AND my copy of the game came with an error printed on the player´s boards (they don’t list the prices for the warehouse goods and the amount of produced goods per level). This error doesn’t impact negatively the game as the same information is on the factory tiles, but still it is annoying. After playing the game I found out I didn’t have missing components. The rules are easy to explain, they flow naturally and make sense.

The artwork is ok.

The decisions you need to take in the game aren’t obvious in any way, furthermore, each decision can affect you on many levels. I love this. Each action you take is in reality two actions, one mayor and one minor, among the main actions you have: Build and modernize factories, employ or fire workers, improve quality, improve distribution channels, buy stocks (the only way to generate VPs). Among the minor actions you have: acquire a better action marker, buy one stock at a half price, or change the price of your goods. You need to accomplish so much with very few actions, it is very tense and I LOVE this. Furthermore each decision also affect more things like the final cost you need to pay for you workers/machines, the demand for a kind of good, the price and quality of the goods and the public´s desire to buy your goods. Besides all that, the effectiveness of each action can be different if you pay more or less in administrative costs and you have to decide where will you play the action because that space becomes blocked for the decade. So after all that I can say the game does indeed offers interesting decisions. I particularly like that you can choose the price for your products freely. 

Player interaction is very mean on this game, and it comes in the way you set your price and quality of your goods. That is the way you can calculate the public´s desire for your goods and if the public wants to buy your goods more than your opponent´s it is possible to leave your opponent with lots and lots of unsold goods and a high bill to pay for the employees and machines :devil:.

It is weird that in an stock buying game you cannot buy stocks from your opponents (this is the first time I have seen this) but I really like this change.

Perhaps it was due to our inexperience, but as a 3 player game I feel it is very easy to unbalance the game in a way a player will get ahead easily. I guess in a 4 player game this can also happen but it should be harder to do, due to this I think Arkwright is best enjoyed as a 4 player game. The downtime isn’t very high because you are constantly planning and calculating so you don´t notice it.

It seems the best strategy is to buy your shares when the company is small and cheap. The player who did this did very good and won as opposed as the players who decided to develop their factories first, those players had much more money but the shares have doubled or tripled in cost so they couldn’t compete. This is exactly what happened with Tesla vs Edison. I dislike this because it seems it is the best pathway to victory. On paper it seems great to know when you have to stop developing and when to buy shares, but on reality that hasn’t been the case. I hope the water frame edition fixes this and perhaps it does because it has 2 additional decades. This is my main issue with the game right now.

Bottom line, as it stands, Arkwright is a borderline 7.0 for me, however I see a lot of potential I want to explore soon. I hope I can play it again this week.

Current Rating: 7.0

Where to begin? I loved it, I loathed learning it and I want to play this every day! It's an economic themed strategy game, set in 17th century England. Conceptually based on the advent of the Industrial Revolution, it presents you with several avenues   Well, perhaps not every day, but after running through the Spinning Jenny scenario I can only conclude that after adding shipping i.e. "Waterwheel" or full rules that Arkwright will become a beloved yearly event, much like Die Macher, Dune and MegaCiv.

2016-12-17 - This is a very good, very heavy game. There's a lot to keep track of, and quite the learning curve. I've only played Spinning Mule, but I enjoyed it.

RATING: 8
Only one 2-player game of Spinning Mule. I look forward to playing with more players and trying out Water Frame. Nevertheless, the core of the game is great! 

Learning from the rules are really the heaviest thing about this game. My wife was taught the game (by me) and did not feel it was all that heavy.

One 2-player game of Water Frame was very good also. The shipping adds a very cool new aspect to the game. I really want to try this with more players. 

Sadly the game is just too long for everyone I play with regularly. I'd love to play it once a month or so, but I do not see that happening.

Moreso than any game I have ever played (including the 18xx) Arkwright really ought to be called Business Economics: The Game.  As almost everything is perfect information and entirely calculable, mostly regardless of what the other players can do in reaction, to play the game well you simply need to be better at doing spreadsheet accounting quick enough so the other players don't get impatient.  I usually love heavy games and brain drain, but this pure numbers crunching just wasn't any fun at all.

This game gave me some good feelings, but I'm afraid that there are better options for an economic game experience. Some things that displeased me:
-cumbersome mechanics and too length time of playing
-the acquired tiles determine absolutely the strategy
-players only can buy shares of his own "color" or corporation
-shares don't represent the value of the companies, but the "total value" of one player
-in theory players can choose between many different actions, but in reality only a few are suitable

RATING: 6
Played once (Water frame) with 3 players.  We called it after 3 decades (out of 5).  It still took 5 hours.  We struggled mightily with the rules.  On some rules, we read and re-read the rules and still came up with different interpretations.  As a result we played it with several rules mistakes.  I suppose there might be a good game in there, but the length of the game probably will preclude me from finding out.  I suspect that given the length of the game, it hasn't been playtested well enough, and some dominant strategy/cards will evolve after it has been played by players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
While the game is fun, the downtime is terrible, and it does get repetitive quickly. I think the game lacked streamlining, as a 3-round, 3-resource game would have been less than half the length, without losing much depth, than the 5-round, 4-resource one we have right now.

In addition to the downtime, this game is hurt by three things: the amount of choices available at all times is too much. which leads to AP; the calculations are complex and constant (and that's coming from someone whose #1 and 3 games are Power Grid and Russian Railroads, respectively), which is not particularly fun; and the risks you have to take are far too great for a game this length, and sometimes you just have to take them.

Work the game. And I love it. Many strategies to think about, how to outsell your opponents, when to buy stocks. This game is suited for heavy economic gamers, and I got a chuckle thinking about if you tried to bring this game out at a casual party. That said a beginner 3 player game took us almost 6 hours. The biggest complaint, and I see I'm not alone here, is the rulebook is atrocious.

Only one play of the light version, but it seems that this is mostly a turn order/timing game obfuscated (somewhat pleasurably) with a lot of involved but straightforward math.

From my play I imagine that the full game has a large potential for AP downtime, and doesn't add too much to the basic essence of the game, but puts a few more levers into the math mix.

It was diverting and fun, however long term I don't think there's much extra depth, and no real mechanical novelty. It is more of a classic Eurogame, where system complexity is mostly a product of complication, rather than emergent space.

RATING: 10
Heavy, not because of the rules, but you can make many little mistakes, that you have  problems in the next rounds . (Selling in England - fulfil Contracts!) All time be careful! The game does not forgive many mistakes.
That is why i love this game, you are always counting but you do not really know all what happens.

Update: 9 plays under my belt --> 10!

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Quite a bit of math. Need to develop a spreadsheet tool to quickly punch in the numbers for the domestic market setting! Played the full version and likely never want to play just the spinning Jenny. Lots of variation in special chits which provide special abilities or improved actions which provide replay value as well. First few plays are likely to take 5-6 hours including rules.

A game on economics always interests me.  This one by a German seems to be a more sophisticated Euro-engine game, which is suitable more to abstract theme and theory manifestation.  On my watch list.

Factory mat 오류가 있는 초기 판본. 

Sp-jenny: 
생각보단 단순했다. 그렇지만 초보자에겐 쉽지 않아보인다.
돈을 벌기 쉽지 않아 고생했지만 방법이 없는 아니기 때문에 
잘 운영하면 꽤 나올것 같다. 

WaterFrame:
정식 버전인듯한 느낌이다. 
2인이어서 사람이 많아 안나가고, 바로바로 견제가 가능했다.
의외로 턴이 1턴정도 긴 느낌이 날 정도로, 
초반에 쉽게 정착했다. 수출시장이 리스크에 비해 소득이 좋았다. 
이런 게임은 안정보다 지속적인 생산 추가 및 판매가 필요한데,

Rating after one play, Spinning Jenny, 3 players.

Clever, heavy economic game with great mechanics. I think there will be a lot more options and variation when using the full set of rules, so rating might increase.

Rating went up to 10 after ülaying the Waterframe variant. Much richer, more strategies but very heavy. Great fun though.

After four plays of [b][thing=154825][/thing][/b]'s "Spinning Jenny/Spinning Mule" version, I'm conflicted.  Though I found the three-player game interesting, given the option, there are a lot of [b][family=19][/family][/b] games that I'd rather play.  That said, it'd be nice to table the full "Waterframe" version at least a few times in the not too distant future to see how it all works.  I'm fairly certain the two more decades (turns) and the addition of the foreign market will add to my enjoyment of the game.  The biggest problem is, of course, that it is competing directly with so many other heavy games for table time....

Arkwright is an intense economic game of operating factories, managing your workforce, and producing goods to meet both internal demand and to to satisfy foreign contracts.

feels like the spiritual successor to Power Grid. not too difficult to comprehend but it has a lot of intricate depth to it.  the gameplay is tight - there's no such thing as a wasted move, and the game really unfolds as people go down their individual paths to success. definitely want to play it a few more times to see if i can get consistently good at it.

Played 2 full version games and it did not go well with 3 players.  The end game each time is just one upping each other to raise your stock value. To have all that invested play time (~1hr/player) come down to who goes last seems like a complete waste to me.

My first couple plays of Spinning Jenny left me pretty intrigued. I enjoyed the plays but mostly I was gaining enthusiasm for the full game, Waterframe. Upon playing the latter, I've decided this game takes too much time, features too much downtime, is too unforgiving, and requires too much math for me to properly enjoy. It feels very much like an 18xx game, both in time involved, calculations needed, and mean aggressive swings.

I'm willing to play it again. It's a fine design and features some very clever mechanisms (such as the hiring of workers raises demand in products). I don't dislike any particular aspect of it except how unforgiving it can be. My main issue is simply the time involved, and therefore the impact of mistakes or punishments. I'm no longer enthusiastic to play again, and I'd prefer the shorter version to the full game.

[b]Arkwright[/b]
2-4 players

Heavy economic game.

[i]
In Arkwright players run up to four factories in England during the late 18th Century. Your goal is to have the most valuable block of own shares. Thus, you must increase your share value and buy shares from the bank.

To run the factories, you need workers. When hiring Workers, demand is automatically created. But of course you want to replace your expensive workers (wage 2-5) by machines (1). To have more output from your factories you may employ new Workers or improve your factory to the next technical level.

You fix the price for your goods during an action round. To enhance your chances of selling goods, you improve your factories to higher levels, increase the quality and make some sales promotion. The higher these factors, the better are your chances of success - the higher the price, the lower.

Each player has an own set of "action tokens" like "build and modernize factories", "employ new workers", "improve quality" etc. On your turn you place one of those tokens on one of the free spaces in your line of the "Administration board" and pay the according administration costs, ranging from 2 to 10 (odd numbers). Some actions depend on how much you paid, i.e. you may buy more machines with one single action, when you pay more (= use a higher space, which is then blocked for the rest of the round). During the game your actions become more and more effective by new tokens, i.e. allow you to buy 3 machines in a single turn instead of 2, increase quality 2 levels instead of only 1...).

After each round of actions one kind of factories is active and you have to pay for all your workers and machines there, then sell the manufactured products. The value of your shares increases for sold products and best quality.

Goods may also be traded to the colonies by ship - provided you have a contract with the monopoly of the East Indian Company.

After four turns each of the factories has produced and the round ends. Players remove the action tokens from the administration board and reveal an event token. After 5 rounds the player with the most valuable block of shares wins. Neither being to be the one with the most shares nor being the one with the highest share value guarantees victory.

Arkwright allows you to act in different ways. Run all four factories with most possible output, set the focus on only two factories and improve them more than the others can; use shipping to colony or focus on the home market. In any way you have to react to the opponents and their strategy. Enter markets with deficit in supply or give up business where the other players start to push you out. Buy shares when they are cheap and increase the value, or first make money and buy shares later.

To get familiar with the market mechanics you may start with a 120 minutes version "Spinning Jenny", but for those who like full strategy in economic themed games, the 240 minute "Waterframe"-Rules come with more options to improve your factory and use ships.

It's a valiant attempt at a heavy economic game, but unfortunately there are a couple of flaws... though I'm not sure they're fatal.

The upper share limit is a bad design choice - nothing like watching someone with an excess of money unable to win simply because there are no more shares to purchase.

The labour market and how it reacts to demand is believable and realistic.  The trouble with the game is that there are too many "known elements" meaning it's easy to predict what each player will do on their turn, especially as you approach the game end.  So while it's all functional stuff, there's not a lot of fun when you can pretty much play all the player's turns for them.

Overall, a good experience if you really really enjoy economic engine games, but at the very high MSRP you would expect more of a game than their ultimately is.

Gioconeoneone. Solo la spiegazione dura quasi un'ora e spesso non basta per dissipare i dubbi. I primi turni sono una sorta di esplorazione del gioco economico e di industrializzazione ambientato a fine diciassettesimo secolo. Suddiviso in decadi il gioco permette ai giocatori di sviluppare il proprio colosso industriale assumendo lavoratori, meccanizzando la produzione, puntare sulla qualità, sulla pubblicità il tutto finalizzato alla produzione e vendita di merci. Molto ambientato il gioco ha un importante aspetto azionario che determinerà il vincitore. La bellezza del gioco sta appunto del valutare e stimare la richiesta di mercato, la propria capacità produttiva la possibilità di conservare merci nei magazzini o di spedirle a mercati esteri. Gioco molto molto interessante ma anche complesso e lungo.

"Spreadsheet - The Game" es el mote despectivo que este juego ha sabido ganarse de parte de los más acérrimos detractores de los juegos complejos de administración de empresas. En principio no es mi caso. Entre mis juegos favoritos está la serie Power Grid, en particular, Power Grid: Factory Manager o el reciente Food Chain Magnate y algún 18XX. No me importa que decidir un acción importe una buena dosis de cálculo y planificación, en tanto que la decisión y el efecto tenga un impacto significativo en mi estrategia y el desarrollo de la partida. Pero ahí es donde este título tan esperado en el Ficus quedó un poco en el camino.

Arkwright tiene todos los elementos que uno podría esperar en un juego de administración de empresas complejo y detallado. Mano de obra, personal jerárquico, instalaciones, tecnología, un mercado fluctuante y un mercado externo, marketing, calidad, finanzas, acciones... salvo impuestos tenés de todo (claramente, en ningún lado del mundo se considera entretenido pagar impuestos!!!). El tema es que "quien mucho abarca, poco aprieta". Gran parte de esos elementos componen un nivel de abstracción que los vuelven absolutamente genéricos, de manera que se convierten en indistinguibles piezas numéricas de un modelo matemático.

Esto conlleva un efecto importante para el jugador, que ya no tiene dificultades con su personal, o con el mensaje de marketing de su competencia, todo se vuelve un conjunto difuso de meros precios. Es lo que hacés durante la partida, calcular precios y precios y precios.

Estos precios no te dan mucho margen para estrategias diferenciadas, o al menos, que se sientan diferenciadas, porque si bien vos estás invirtiendo en marketing o calidad y yo en máquinas o el mercado externo, todo se reduce a precios. Es tu precio contra mi precio, aún si vendemos productos completamente distintos, fabricados y vendidos de formas completamente distintas. En la práctica, se siente seco.

Entonces, el amplio espectro de variables prometido se reduce y simplifica enormemente. Las acciones son pequeñas ventajas de unos pocos pesos más o menos, y luego de media hora de calcular y recalcular cada pesito de cada acción de cada jugador, podés estar satisfecho si tu ronda termina con una ventaja de $10 en un juego que después de cuatro horas termina en $600... es tedioso. No hay un solo pico de tensión. Ningún momento de sorpresa o admiración. Es una insufrible seguidilla de "cálculo, +1 pesito, cálculo, -1 pesito, cálculo, +2 pesitos..." una y otra vez.

Más allá de las desconexiones entre la temática y la mecánica, que tal vez algún otro quiera comentar, al juego le falta tensión y personalidad. No tiene el counter-play trashero de los 18XX, ni el paso fluido del PG: Factory Manager, ni los momentos broken del Food Chain, tiene el cálculo, mucho cálculo, fuerza bruta de cálculo, como cuatro horas seguidas de la última ronda de subasta en una partida de Power Grid de a 6. Es demasiado.

Seguramente hay jugadores a los que les encanta particularmente este elemento de cálculo (no de decisión, simplemente de cálculo) pero creo que el atractivo del diseño es menos universal de lo que se pretende o podría esperar, incluso entre los jugadores experimentados aficionados al género.

Based on one play: You create production of up to 4 types of goods and then play with the appeal of your good to be able to sell as many as you can. This moves your share price up and the objective is to have the highest value of shares (number times value) at the end. So basically make as much money as you can. I am still on the fence and there seems to be a lot going on but for a simple objective that can be obtained with just utilizing certain parts of the game. A complex game for sure, so it requires more plays.

I’ve only played the “Spinning Jenny” (easy) version of the game, so my feelings may change when I get a chance to play the “Waterframe” (full) game. In Arkwright, players set up factories that sell four different goods, the demand for which is determined by the number of pawns employed by the factories. Goods are sold in a system reminiscent of Automobile, and those goods that have a higher “appeal” (which incorporates player-set price) are sold first. Each round consists of four turns, at the end of which one type of good will be produced, so if you’re not in that market, it’s basically a set-up round for future production turns. Selling goods effectively give you bumps on the share track, which at the end of the game is multiplied by your number of shares to determine the victor. Shares in this game really feel more like loans, as you can only invest in yourself, and you’re forced to sell some at the game’s onset for initial capital. This version of the game is really arithmetic-heavy, and forces players to plan out multiple turns to stay solvent while investing in shares and assets. The Spinning Jenny game provides a difficult economic simulation, but lacks the bells and whistles that might make it more interesting.

On initial impressions, I was a bit worried about the game. It looked like a spreadsheet. After 1 play of Spinning Jenny, I was quite impressed. Lots to do and think about and it was much more "fun" then I was expecting. I'm ready to try the Water frame version.

I'm mildly upset with the player boards missing numbers. I do also think the rules could use some work. I read the production phase like 10 times before I finally could wrap my head around what we were supposed to be doing. The new Capstone rules are slightly clearer (flipside up = face down, commercial rounding = round up [but only to the nearest dollar]), but it's generally the same thing.

[b]Update:[/b] So I finally got in a play of Water Frame. I feel like this is the place to start even though it's a TON to take in. The real difficulty comes into play with the development tiles. Those are not well written on the actual tile and just add more confusion to the learning of the game. I wish they would have been cards or something although I realize that would have probably just added to the cost of the game. But having a card spell out far more clearly than the tiny tile would have been much, much better.

The money in this game is really tight and the player board issues are way overblown. I found it extremely difficult to open beyond 2 factories as I kept wanting to modernize and adjust my other factories. I feel like you have a lot of wiggle room with game choices though and each game can play out differently. The events were rather mean though, but I think we got hit with the difficult ones instead of the beneficial ones.

In our first play, setup and rules started at 7:30 and ended at 11. For that much rules burden, this game needed to be a lot more compelling. Overall the game is fine. The general idea is you build and operate factories to produce goods, which you sell in one of two places, generating you money or money + stock value. You start the game with a certain amount of stock in yourself, and the key to the game is getting enough money to buy more of your own stock. It's extremely chartsy, which is a little dull, but ultimately fine. The game itself with 4 players went from around 11 til a little after 4am. Over the course of the game, there are decisions to be made, but I didn't feel like I had any difficult decisions. Mostly what you are doing is minimizing your costs and improving your output through upgrade actions, and then just lining up your sell actions fairly solitary and fairly robotically. 

The method by which goods are produced is a very fiddly process, which isn't great. Component wise the game is overall fine, although the upgrade tiles seem needlessly small and hard to read. The rulebook is also written very confusingly. Many times we had to check boardgamegeek or read the examples in the rulebook to have any idea about what was supposed to be happening. Despite all the time we spent going over the rules, I wound up taking a massive penalty in the last round because of a edge case scenario where you have to pay money if literally all the workers are gone when factories depreciated. Despite all the time we had put into the rules, we didn't read this one somehow, so I had no idea that this was going to happen or else I would have avoided the situation. It removed any hope I had of doing ok, which stung since I didn't have control of how many guys were in the worker pool.

All this taken into consideration, I have to compare this to other longer games that I do like, and each of those games manages to capture some magic or excitement that this game just lacks. The player interaction here is low, there are decisions to be made, but none are particularly difficult or interesting, and of course there's no pretense at theme happening here, which isn't necessary but can sometimes carry a game like this. Overall, the game is fine and competent, just not worth the time investment to learn and play.

I am giving this game an initial rating of 5 after one play. This score will either increase or decrease after subsequent plays. The game play is intriguing enough to warrant a purchase for further plays. However, I have some strong concerns that need further game plays to see if they are warranted. Regardless, it was a strong first impression, and I appreciate a game that can grab my attention so strongly.

2/7/17 Update: Ordered the Capstone "Christmas Tree" Edition plus the Noleesse Oblige mini expansion.

2/14/17 Update: Second play with Spinning Jenny to lock down the rules. The game failed to impress my wife. Unless I can find a group to play with, score may decrease further.

2/18/2017 Update: Second play with Water Frame. Bumping my rating up a bit. Still concerned about the rules, as many actions seems to have exceptions due to the development tiles you may have. While not necessarily a bad thing, it does make it difficult to make sure other players are executing the action correctly. Also, the theme seems very underutilized.

We played the Spinning Jenny version of Arkwright on our first play-through, and I really enjoyed it.  The mechanisms are connected in intriguing ways, although I have not yet figured out how to develop a coherent strategy.  I think the basic version of the game is a great way to get your feet wet and ensure that you have the rules down without spending 4 hours playing, but it really is only half a game in many ways.  For example, given that the game ends only after 4 rounds, the incentive to buy stocks early, in my opinion, is diminished, as you are not going to leave much value on the table by buying later because your stock price is not going to climb as high as it might in Water Frame, and so the Spinning Jenny players can ignore the tension of when to start buying stock, which I think is one of the most interesting decisions in the game.

Overall, the design is very solid, and I'm looking forward to playing Water Frame.  I suspect that my rating will climb on this one.

RATING: 8
Very heavy, clever and deep economic game. Managing all your factories and workers is quite something to do, but you also have to set prices for the goods and compete with your opponents for the customers. I really like the "quality of the goods minus price equals appeal for customers" mechanism on which the market system in Arkwright is based on. But in the Waterframe variant you also have possibility to export overseas to separate partially from this system. I like the general action selection mechanism quite well and there are a lot of "special powers" that give bonuses or upgrade your basic actions.

The game itself is really brilliant and I would rate it a 9 from pure gameplay, but it is also very fiddly. There is quite some rules overhead (about one hour of explanation; about 10 unique upgrades do not help to keep this time down) and setup also takes some time. Especially late in the game calculating which price you should set and your payoff from selling and shipping your goods becomes very mathy. I like the layout of the game, but in essence it is a spreadsheet. I can recommend this game for everyone who likes heavy  economic games, does not mind some math, and does not get turned off from the dry presentation.

Perhaps a last remark: Arkwright is not really a stock game, but rather focuses on managing your businesses and competing for customers in four different markets (one for each product). Yes, you buy your on stocks from the bank, but this is rather a decision to get your busniness going and have a lot of money anyway or you start out slowly and buy already some of your stocks while they are cheap. But there is no investing in opponents stocks or any "buy low, sell high" in Arkwright.

RATING: 8.2
2 Games in one: a shorter but still interesting 'Spinning Jenny' version and the full 'Waterframe' version!

(+) Fully closed logical economic system affecting all players and offering some very interesting player interaction. Competing on the English market is more tense in the 'Spinning Jenny' version, as in 'Waterframe', players have the option to sell goods to foreign markets.

(+) So much fun finally being able to set your own prices :)

(+) Spinning Jenny version offers a satisfying gaming experience in about 2,5 hours. This makes the game accessible enough. Waterframe probably takes about 5 hours to play and adds a lot of options to the game (development tiles, trade with the colonies, inventory management, ...). Due to the fact that Waterframe offers players more options when they execute their actions timely and cleverly - the 'Spinning Jenny' can feel a little more interactive and offers some more cut throat competition - still the wider scope of Waterframe makes for the more interesting game.

(+) Elegant and structured design and gameplay offering interesting choices each turn.

(+) The game offers opportunities for very 'satisfying' moves: earning a handsome profit feels like a hard fought for accomplishment and it is tense to battle off competition in hard fought for economic sectors (this mainly manifests itself in the 'Spinning Jenny' variant). The 'Waterframe' variant has some satisfying engine building aspects in which you are encouraged to invest in certain aspects at the start of the game to be able to enjoy handsome profits or more flexibility later on.

(+) Components are basic, but functional (exept maybe for the double sided development tiles -> I replaced them by custom printed cards) and of high quality.


(-) This is quite a pricey game

(-) Some minor unfortunate misprints on factory mats, but luckily nothing major

(-) The game involves quite some 'calculating', especially when determining demand/production and when considering buying shares at the second half of the game, which could cause some downtime for players who are not active within the current economic sector.

(-) Setting the game up is quite a pain, especially for the waterframe version with has *lots* of small components (of which some are double sided English/German)

(-) The mechanism in which products can get exported may yield too much money for too little risk? On the other hand, if too many players go all out on export, competition for ships will increase and opportunities on the domestic market (incl increasing share price) will start to shine again... I wouldn't call this mechanic unbalanced, but still I would have liked it more when exporting was a little more difficult. 

Approx game time Spinning Jenny: +- 35-40 min / player
Approx game time Waterframe: +- 70-75 min / player

Tips (Waterframe):
(*) When competition is low, selling to the internal market is the way to go: you will generate income and your stock value will rise. When competition on the internal market gets fierce and you feel like you might be having trouble running your business with enough profit, consider shipping goods out. A situation in which you manage to sell at least one product to the internal market and store/ship the rest would be ideal.

(*) Have enough money at the start of the game to invest in factories, upgrades, machines, R&D/distribution. Initially your income will be very limited, so start up with enough capital.

(*) In my experience, competing with 3 factories might be a sweet spot: you should be able to dominate the internal market with one of two, and be at least more or less competitive in the third (which you can use for shipping goods). That way you have a good balance between focussing your actions, increasing stock value and generating income. When you compete with all four types of factories, you will be facing increasing costs keeping your industry up to date and competing with more focussed players - however, this might work if you rely a little more on shipping.

(*) If you don't own a lamps factory, be sure you can do something useful with your final action (shipping, extra production run (you need that special tile in this case!) to fill your storage, ...)

(*) In the beginning of the game, favor increasing quality over distribution. Near the end, the importance of distribution becomes much more important.

(*) Try to balance number of shares with share price. Better have a reasonable amount of reasonably priced shares than having tons of worthless shares or very few precious shares. When you focus on internal market with occasional shipping you should be able to end up fine.

Stefan Risthaus has constructed a fascinating economic game space and made (earned) a fan of me. The stocks/shares track is a bit of a stroke of genius. No 1-to-1 points conversion here. You must assess the opportune moment during which to buy and sell, and the value of your share will rise or fall depending on the actions you take in the game. The end goal makes perfect sense: whosoever's portfolio holds the most value wins, but it is not always clear how to get there. 

Though at times this does feel like work, it offers such an engrossing economic management experience that I hardly notice. How Mr. Risthaus managed to develop such a design that, despite its complexity, does not feel convoluted, is beyond me.

Preliminary impressions put this rating quite high. This pure economic warfare game provides great depth. So far, Arkwright's only downfall is that it succeeds so well at hitting its presumed target - long, heavy and engrossing play - that it is probably too demanding to see regular play in my group. It will dominate any given evening, and it's only going to interest those who enjoy brain-burning matches. Although I personally like the dry theme and austere presentation, the reward is really in the puzzle; Arkwright provides an excellent economic battleground.

Arkwright is a big, long game. I'm not the biggest fan of the way the markets work, and I can't help feeling that the game takes too long for what I get out of it. If it took 2 hours to play I'd be more interested in it. To be fair, I think the way the market works is reasonably well designed, I just don't tend to like those kinds of managing demand systems in my games. The overall implementation feels long and clunky, and I'd rather play a faster, smoother design like Kanban or Marco Polo.

General ruleset and what you can do on your turn isn't that hard to get, but there is tons to chew on regarding the implications.

A very good game that doesn't really push all my favorite buttons. I enjoy exploring economic systems in games, and this one is not an exception. However, for ultra-heavy economic games, I prefer the spatial logicistics, shared incentives, and market ruthlessness of 18XX. For more abstracted economic Euros, I have more fun playing Nippon, Brass, Vinhos, and Indonesia. The special power tiles are obnoxiously small and difficult to read from across the table, and the spreadsheet upon spreadsheet appearance is hard to get excited about. The selling of goods is also a bit clunky and fiddly.

All-in-all a fine game that has a lot of meat to chew on.  I'd happily play this game, but, all considered, I'd rarely recommend it. If I'm going to spend 3-5 hours on a game like this, I can't help but think I'd rather be playing 18XX or Indonesia.

I'm on the fence yet with this one. I do enjoy the economics here and trying to efficiently make money off of your factories, but I'm a bit off-put by the length of the full Waterframe version, which is really needed to explore the full game. The actions are interesting and certainly obtaining useful bonus tiles is key, and it feels like there are many ways to win. The only concern that I have is that the upgrade tile that lets you exceed the current round is pretty powerful, and getting that at the right time might be the key to victory.

There is a clever management of supply/demand (hiring workers to run your factories and increase supply of goods also increases demands for those goods -- managed cleverly through the job market area.

Heavy, highly abstracted economic game where players produce goods to sell in the highly competitive local market or ship overseas.

The game consists of five decades of four rounds each, so each player will get precisely 20 turns. A different industry runs in each of the four rounds, so each factory will run and have its goods sold to the local market precisely five times. Local demand for each good is set by how many workers players have taken for their factories, and which players get to meet that demand is based on a combination of goods' quality, price and distribution. Selling locally raises companies' share prices, while shipping to less competitive, more lucrative overseas markets lowers them.

Most of the variability in the game comes from the acquisition of powerful bonus tiles, with abilities ranging from stronger versions of basic actions to unique powers; for example, the School allows workers who have been replaced by machines to be retrained/relocated rather than sent packing back to the ranks of the unemployed.
 
This is all balanced very nicely, most mechanisms work thematically and there are a number of possible tactical approaches. There aren't nearly enough actions to go around and the balance between timing, efficiency and available cash is agonizing.

So why am I lukewarm on it?

The first complaint is a minor one: as I expect from Spielworxx, the components have not had great attention paid to usability. Small exceptions (e.g. extra administration fee for re-using a space) could be on the board. Water Frame special tokens are particularly problematic and could have been better explained on e.g. cards. I'm convinced that the market mechanism could be made easier to "read" too, though I'm not sure how; in any case, these small pain points contribute to extending a long game into a too-long one.

But my most major issue is with the number of constraints on play. This is no open Winsome game; it's economics on rails. One simple example is factory obsolescence. Arkwright's factories become obsolete with no input or control from players, like the ticking of a clock. The penalty is high enough that it's a treadmill you can't afford to get off, but also can never get ahead of (Inventor notwithstanding). Compare Brass, where obsolescence is also game-driven but which players can avoid -- at opportunity cost -- by development actions, or most of all the 18XX train rush.

The market too is frustratingly weak. It isn't possible to purchase opponents' "shares", so there are few opportunities for collusion. Caps on pricing and quality ensuring that players stay within a limited band and the ability to ship overseas largely prevents major damage. There is very little room for devastating manipulations except insofar as one dollar there or one good here can do real damage. Extreme strategies are not possible; it's a game of grinding efficiency.

The special ability tiles also force unfavourable comparisons to The Great Zimbabwe and Food Chain Magnate, where many of the powers are so powerful as to seem game-breaking (only to reveal themselves in play as delightfully well-balanced). Arkwright's are too powerful to ignore but do not provide the same distortion to the tactical landscape.

Very complicated game about building and running factories. It's not easy to make a profit because your workers cost a lot of money and you have to price your products right. Replace the workers with machines as soon as possible and send them off into unemployment. I like the symbolism in that the workers are anonymous grey pieces.

Setup is a royal pain, though I'm happy to see pre-determined settings to help get new players started. 

Interesting to note the variances between the two editions (Spinning Jenny and Water Frame). Varied strategies create constant (and tense) decision-making.

I like the Action mechanism interwoven into the 4 Cycles per decade, plus the Worker/demand relationship is clever. The game can be unforgiving where a single mis-timed error may be fatal.

A nice looking production from Spielworxx (but with unfortunate misprints), the addition of the Player's Book is especially welcome as this is a heavy game. But not replacing the misprinted Player Boards is disappointing (doesn't really affect gameplay since you can read production right off the factory tiles, however).

As is the norm for Spielworxx, a poorly organized rulebook makes learning the game much more of a chore than it should be. Set aside several hours (at least) if you plan on teaching yourself. But once grasped, it plays relatively easily (if not a bit fiddly in a few spots).

Initially the game is just a blurry haze. But once fathomed and some play experience is gained, Arkwright is extremely fun! Make no mistake, this is a heavy economic game and is not for the casual player.

After 3 playes: To much math throughout the gameplay kills  atmosphere of industrial revolution period. But i like logic and meaningful mechanics of the game and indeed, i really enjoy this game. A lot of stuff to explore, mainly strategic ways. 

I recommend full Waterframe version. Spinning Jenny is too flat i think.

I haven't met another game that comes so close to the types of computer games I like.

It is an amazing factory management game where you constantly must make difficult decisions regarding investing for the future at a risk of losing money now, or building up certain aspects now in hopes of a quick profit.  All the while while trying to decide when is the best time to buy your stock.  Now when it is cheaper, but have less cash to expand and upgrade, or later when stock price is higher, but you have more money(hopefully).

If you like heavy games, I cannot think of any better.

tl;dr: heavy, dry and good

There's a reason this is the last game from my Essen haul to hit the table. The basic version of the game is 24 pages of rules. The advanced version adds another 32 pages and then there is an additional overview of components and strategies that is just as thick. Of course we opted for the basic version with the predetermined setup, as it is already complex enough to satisfy most hardcore eurogamers.
This game continues the line of complex strategy games that we've come to expect from Spielworxx and it is just as well developed as their other titles. Even with the sizable rulebook most rules are intuitive and everything makes sense. There are a few details which could easily be forgotten, but I guess most of them won't ruin the game if you do.
This is definitely a game that begs to be explored more after the first play. It's also a game in which every action counts. I screwed up the very first action and than wasted an other one in the 2nd round and as a result I lost. It's that kind of game. I enjoyed it and look forward to playing it more. I don't expect to move on to the advanced game any time soon though.

A true mental workout game; checking out is simply impossible. You have to pay constant attention to what's going on around you, and even then you may miss something crucial.

This game is a constant stream of calculations and reactions and planning and re-planning. It is intimidating. It is intense. It is engrossing. I'm not sure the word "fun" applies to this game. "Intellectually stimulating" is probably a better term for it.

I want to play this more, but I'm not sure I want to play it often. Whereas I could probably play 18xx every week, Indonesia several times a week, and Through the Ages daily, this one probably settles around the once-or-twice-a-month level.

Having said that, I do think it's a [i]better game[/i] than your average 18xx. It plays beautifully across player counts, the theme is rich and integrated, and I find the underlying system to be much more consistent with what you are trying to accomplish.

This could be a 9 or it could be a 5, so I'm calling it a 7 for now. Hard to tell after one play of the Waterframe version. It reminds me a lot of Wealth of Nations. Want to play again.

One player in our game tried to do a "ship first" strategy, which clearly is not a good move. Not only does it not make enough money relative to simply selling based on appeal, but it let the other players have too much freedom to sell on appeal.

I'm not sure why the rules for loans and such even exist - you'd be hard pressed not to make some sort of profit. The key is optimizing for most profit.

Excellent economic game which tries to emulate the early stages of capitalism. While this is impossible unless you truly understand the inner workings of the capitalist system as revealed by Karl Marx, it is still a terrific game that as well as being fun is a great way to introduce people to basic economic ideas. Its definitely not for everyone being a real number cruncher and for those not interested in economics it could feel a little dry. But I love this game and wish there were more like it. To shine it needs, like wargame people prepared to put the time in an master its deep strategies. Also downtime in 4 player games with new or inexperienced players can be a problem. The only criticism I have is I would of liked to see a shorter version of the game that retains the depth of the Water Frame rules. Plus the rule book can be confusing at times and would be better served by using clauses and an index to make referencing rules easier. A heavy game from a Euro point of view but light from a Wargame perspective.If you love economic game like 18xx this is a no brainer.

This is really difficult for me. I quite like the Spinning Jenny variant with its high level of interaction but it would benefit from more options. Waterframe certainly has more options (and lots more downtime too unfortunately) but in a four-player game it seems difficult to run a winning strategy without the income and lowered stock price from shipping to the colonies. This takes away most of the player interaction for a large chunk of the game and 4 hours plus of multiplayer solitaire is not my kind of fun.

Incl. Upgrade Kit and Replacement Foils.

A single play of Spinning Jenny at 2p seems to show this game for what it is, a complex efficiency exercise disguised as a market game. 

The design tends toward being over-burdened, between the action management that ties into your money pool and the (not all-together inorganic) weaving of additional factors into the market timing-puzzle, it seems to tilt toward being constrictive in a funneling way rather than in a way that encourages clever play.

I will admit that most of this may be an artifact of the Spinning Jenny rule-set, in which a very limited number of actions by necessity limits the arc of the players. The ability to sell overseas in the Waterframe rules (for higher profit but no increase in stock price) may unlock more of the game than comes through initially.

I also have hope that the Noblesse Oblige expansion gives the design some much needed wiggle room.

High investment to set up and learn. If you take your time to comb through the rulebooks and learn the game correctly, the rules are actually pretty simple. A little dry and long for an economic stock manipulation game. Enjoyed Planet Steam more for the same kind of thing.

Brief synopsis: your score at the end of the game is the value of your stock portfolio, e.g. if I have 20 stocks and my stock value is 15 then my score is 20 x 15= 300. Note: this is not really a "stock game" per se, as you only ever buy your own stock. 

You start the game with some stocks but no money, and so are forced to immediately sell stocks in order to raise money for your initial investments. The economy consists of 4 different goods that are produced and then sold to either the local market (England) or abroad (India). 

In England, there is limited demand for each good (collectively determined by how many workers are hired), and if supply exceeds demand then not everyone gets to sell all their stuff. Who gets priority? The pecking order is determined by your position on the "appeal track" for that good. The formula for your position on this track is the base value of the good plus some modifiers you can invest in (quality, advertising) MINUS the price you are selling at. Selling to England makes you money but more importantly is the only way to move up the track that determines your stock value. If you sold at least 1/2 goods you'll get 1/2 bumps, and there's additional bumps available for the player who (a) sold the most goods, and (b) is highest on the appeal track. 

Selling to India, on the other hand, can be much more profitable, as there is unlimited demand and therefore no competition. However, shipping goods to India actually moves you BACKWARDS on the stock value track, one bump for each ship you use. In our second game, the two players who shipped to India absolutely killed the players who didn't, which led to some rumblings about shipping being overpowered/essential. The game after that, those who shipped to India made ridiculous money, but hit a brick wall due to the fact that you are limited to 30 shares max! Of course, the player who never shipped to India won with fewer shares that were worth more apiece.

So what you are trying to do is be as "square" as possible, i.e. have your # of shares and their value be as close as possible (5 x 5 > 6 x 4). Shipping to India requires elaborate planning (you have to get contracts, buy ships, etc) but is completely non-interactive. The interaction lies in the competition to sell goods in England, both for money as well as for moving up your stock value track. There are also about 30 unique special tiles that give you abilities ranging from the mundane (save $x when you do y) to ones that manipulate turn order, your ability to sell, etc. I like that you only see a subset (70% with 4 players) of the possible special tiles each game.

There's other cool stuff going on- at the end of each turn a different good is sold, e.g. this turn we're selling bread, next turn cutlery, the turn after that shirts... this creates a nice decision space where you have to plan your future actions carefully, e.g "I need to hire more workers before shirts produce again, but also want to grab that special tile before someone else does, but I also need to grab a contract so I can ship bread, etc etc". 

So what's not to like? Well, the game is probably a bit too long for what it is, and if you've got analysis paralysis types it could be torturous. You really need the right group for this game, and even then you're looking at 4 hours (with the wrong crowd you could easily end up in an 8 hour game of this). Some decisions become easier with experience, e.g. what special tile to grab, but others inevitably require a bit of thought, e.g. changing the price of your goods. The game is definitely mathy and requires a lot of backwards calculation: what price do I need to set in order to sell x number of goods, so I have y left over to fulfill my contract?

The bottom line: after a handful of plays our group was done with Arkwright. There's stuff I really like: the best strategy clearly depends on what other players are doing- you need to react to their investments and seek the underserved markets. But there's just too much bloat and process surrounding the relatively few interesting decisions. If this were trimmed down to a 2-3 hour game that preserved all the good parts while minimizing the mundane, Arkwright would be among my personal favorites. But it just takes too damn long for what it is. Making the shipping to India completely non-interactive was a mistake in my view.

Heavy economic simulation set in England during the 18th century Industrial Revolution.  I'm reminded of the computerized business simulations we had in grad school back in the day where variables were input as batches to the school mainframe and we got greenbar paper printouts of the results the next day--only this game does a much better job at it!  So many business, manufacturing, marketing, and economic relationships to explore that I have not seen brought to table top gaming (or at least not all in one gaming experience).  Relationships of; labor market on demand, wages on margin, price setting on demand, customer utility on brand preference, warehousing and idle costs from overproduction, automation on employment, inside info and business performance on the stock market, administrative strategic planning decisions on results, foreign export/import influence on the market and business profit, plant decisions and business performance from product specialization or diversification, quantity or price on revenue, and the painful obsolescence ROI decisions of re-tooling and plant renovation with improving technology.  So great.  And, this game system beautifully scales player count on the labor pool, employment, and supply and demand from increased workforce and competition.  If only it dabbled a little more with product life cycle but I only offer this because of how amazed I am at what it does cover.  Lots of pieces, not something that just causally comes to table, this needs brainpower commitment.  Ceteris paribus.

A bit of a learning curve on this one...especially with the 2 rule books to comb through but if you like stock market type games this one might be for you. Be aware that it plays best with more than 2 players and it will take all night to play.

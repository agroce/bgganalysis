Kind of like Cranium but only with card games such as Chronology/Timeline and Apples to Apples. Adequate diversion once one gets past the snarky comments on the cards.

[creative judgment, 2+p]

The variant on Apples to Apples included in the box is great.  Everyone playing cards all at the same time reduces downtime, and I love that there's now strategy in choosing where the cards in your hand go.

The Timeline gametype is great!  It gives you more time with each individual card to read the jokes, which you don't get time for in the Apples to Apples gametype.  It's also the one gametype you can play with two, which makes the box more valuable for me.

Haven't played all the gametypes yet.  This was my first game system and it got me hooked on the idea that you can expand your game just by printing out different rules from the internet.  For example, this is compatible with the Monikers ruleset!

Some of the cards are definitely not for children (or teenagers either).  I'd want to prune out the Wonderbra card before playing Monikers, for example.  HOWEVER, Monikers's cards were far worse than what's inside the Metagame.

The blanks on the colored cards leave room for player error.  One player was dealt the card "It belongs in a _____!".   The Metagame probably was implying "museum" as the standard answer, although "dumpster" would be a fine answer too.  The player suggested "a mason jar", and not many cards depict objects that fit inside mason jars.

Some of the gametypes seem cute but may not work well in practice.  The Dixit gametype (available online) would probably just convince me to buy real Dixit cards instead.  The Snake Oil gametype (also available online) I just outright didn't print, because it misses the magic of snake oil (picking two words to make something nonsensical, where the performance is the important part) and becomes vanilla Apples to Apples with a short speech attached.

This box plus Codenames satisfies my party game genre.

Matchmakers works really smooth as a step up from Apples to Apples. After playing matchmakers it isn't to hard to teach metaquilt, and then go wherever and play other games.

The different games you can play with the deck make it very versatile for parties - My favorite is the Metaquilt as it's such a strategic game. But if you've got a bunch of friends over who don't want something as intricate, you can play one of the larger, more casual games like Debate Club, which is always a good time.

Wow, someone took Apples to Apples and gave it even shittier rules? Alright!

Better when played with straight A2A rules, but still not a very good game.

I've spent a large portion of my life talking and arguing about video games... maybe some things in life are better left un-gameified.

RATING: 5
Gifted by my Grandfather's wife! What a hip present.

I've only played the 2 player versions of this, and they're fine. I want to see how it plays with a larger group and with the other game variants.

After playing with 3 players: this is good! We played two variants included in the box with some minor modifications, which the manual encourages doing. I'd definitely pick playing this over Apples to Apples or the like.

edit: JUST KIDDING couldn't justify keeping this. Gifted to my partner to play as an icebreaker game for people who don't typically play board games.

RATING: 10
The MetaGame is incredibly fun for getting into sometimes deep, usually nonsensical debates about cultural artifacts and how we relate to them. It's great for practicing quick thinking and debating. You'll be in situations where you have to, for example, out-bullshit your friends on why a bikini or spork would be more useful when stranded on a desert island than Spam. I've played it with many friends, from hardcore gamers to people who don't like playing games much at all, and all of them have enjoyed the Metagame. 

The cards are well designed. They feel good in your hand, and I enjoy the simple, iconic art style. The text captions on each card are also super witty and fun to read.

I also really like the way the deck is presented as a "Game Operating System", with multiple game variants for numbers of players ranging from 2 to 5 to upwards of 30. It's great how the designers encourage people to modify them and create their own variants as well.

There is some strategy in terms of how you decide to play your cards in variants like Matchmakers and Head-to-Head, and my favorite, Metaquilt, but if you're looking for a deep strategy game, this probably isn't for you. But that's not what it's designed for. The game does it's job perfectly of being fun for hanging out and drinking with friends, as a facilitator for getting into crazy but smart discussions.

This is probably my favorite Apples to Apples play the table style game. I find it works well with both serious groups who want to discuss the impact of culture and goofy groups that want to make dick jokes.

The scope is necessarily less personal and less open to interpretation, but I find that--plus the many discussion oriented playstyles--actually gets people thinking and learning more about their friends.

I've played the Metagame at the Game Developers Conference and thought it was brilliant game. How many other games do you know that can be played by hundreds. of people over several days? I was curious to find out if this "home version" would work for smaller groups. The short answer: "Yes!"

This is a great party game and there are many variations to try. We had 7 people over last weekend and spent several hours trying out 3 of the 6 games. The basic game, Matchmakers, felt a lot like Apples to Apples with a slight twist. It was fun, and it's a nice way to get acquainted with the game, but didn't provoke a lot of laughter or discussion. 

On the other hand, MetaQuilt was hilarious. It has a great combination of craziness and strategy. The cards need to be played into a grid and every card needs to somehow relate to the adjacent cards already on the table. If someone thinks they have a better match then they can challenge the played card with his or her own card. This starts a mini-debate. The other players vote on who made the best case for his or her card. This caused a lot of passionately silly discussions. The cards with "blanks" on them (where the player can insert any word they want) were the stars of the show. Our group generally managed to keep our words PG rated, but I could see this getting much "rougher" with certain play groups (and/or alcohol).

We also tried History 101. We didn't think we would like it much because most of us aren't good at remembering dates. Plus our group ranged in age from 20 to 50 and we assumed the older folks would have a big advantage. This turned out not to be the case. The culture cards cover a wide span of time, so all us had our areas of expertise. The way the game is structured makes it relatively easy for everyone in the beginning, but it gets progressively harder for everyone near the end. We were all surprised by how much we enjoyed this mode. 

We all look forward to trying out the other modes in the future. I'll definitely be taking this game out the next time we have a large group of people over for gaming (or just need a conversation starter).

I go to a game night that divides into two rooms: the "rules" room, and the "colors and feelings" room. (Not my name for it! Their name for it!) I am mostly a "rules" kind of gamer, i.e. I don't like Superfight.

I sometimes want to bring this and play it in the "colors and feelings" room, but I think the people there would make it about stagecraft whereas I actually want the dry academic shadowboxing. So unfair, nobody will argue with me.

Was great when I used to be a video game developer. Always down to express video game opinions. Now the hobby has grown stale and its best jokes are at the industry's expense. Doesn't take up much space at all so I'll be holding on to it for now.

I generally hate trivia games, but this at least has gotten to the tipping point of games I can be convinced to play.  The fact that it is just date ranges takes some of the stress off and luck can give you a significant edge in this game by choosing a card that would fall in a wide period of history.

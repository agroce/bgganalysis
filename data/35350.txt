Like it's sister game, Rommel, a very well designed solitaire game that mixes some euro style mechanics and decisions into a wargame. It has a particularly nice timing idea that means you can plough ahead if you want in an effort to score more vp's or sit back and rack up more resources for your assaults.
Not sure it has as much replayability as Rommel but the components are a notch up.

This is an interesting solitaire experience, played across four different boards -- with slight modifications to the rules. There are some interesting decisions to be made, a little press-your-luck aspects, and quite a bit of emotional investment as the pushover battle you thought you were just about to start winds up having two surprise guests which will make your situation potentially precarious instead.

All-in-all, a nice game -- even if it is a little bit cumbersome from a "chit-management" perspective.

Pre-ordered 4/4/08
Arrived 18/4/09

The difference in production quality compared to 1st ed Rommel is amazing. The maps especially are stunning silk coated mounted maps on single fold (A3) boards. The die is still rubbish, but the box is much stronger (and it also has the game title printed on the ends, unlike Rommel). 

The game itself is fine, good fun, but extremely linear. Not really many meaningful choices. I learned a lot about Alexander though!

It seems like a vintage Dan Versen game: solitaire and lots of chit cups, high production values, good rulebook and kind of "meh" in the end.

I would rather a play a Field Commander game than a Leader game because blowing up stuff and getting blown up is more thrilling than dealing with pilot fatigue.

I am in the minority, but I think this is the best of the Field Commander games.  It seems like more people prefer [thing=42673][/thing].  That maybe because it has a better combat system (it does) or more scenario choices (it does), or that Napoleon is a more popular topic than Alexander.  The opposite is true for me.  I like this one because of the insights and prophesies and the choices to raze a city or set up a governor.

This is really the only Field Commander game that I look forward to getting on to the table.

RATING: 8
Very nice components (the mounted maps are especially well done), easily digestible rules and it plays in a reasonable amount of time. You have a limited number of turns to accomplish your goals, and there is some chaos to deal with, so each game has had some tense moments so far. Recommended.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is much much better than Rommel and Nimitz. This game is actually really good. The battle plans are not unbalanced and overpowered like in Rommel. And you do not drown in endless dice rolling like in Nimitz. Battle plans really work here as an addition to battle and dice rolling is kept in reasonable limits. Alexander is balanced and does not try to hide poor mechanics behind a wall of countless enemies coming at you like the undead and overpowered battle plans. The game plays smooth and everything works. There is lots of stuff to do and playing feels like the big adventure you associate with a figure like Alexander. This is as good as Dan Verssen's Leader Series.

After rommel i got this one, it had better maps, mechanics adapted to the theme (war is not the way to conquer every time), in brief, very nicely done as it seems to be a standard at DVG.
But my rating dropped because of one thing : it's too easy. Got good victory too quickly. Maybe it was meant to keep you try improving your score instead of keep you try succeeding, but that didn't work on me, and I lost my interest for the game. Maybe will replay it one day, and will anyway keep it because it's beautiful and one-f-a-kind.

Rated as a solo game, vs how I would rate a multiplayer game. At first I was struck at how easy this game seemed playing the first scenario. Then onto the next the depth and challenge of the game really came into being. The rules could use a bit more clarity, but it is not at all overly complex and a fun play at about 60 minutes long in my plays. Great solo experience!

FC: Alexander seems much easier than FC: Rommel, which is a small knock against it. On the plus side, however, I like the combat system much better. There is room for strategy in how you set up your forces and how to use Alexander. The Prophecy mechanic is a nice add on as well. Components are also miles above my version of FC: Rommel. Keeper.

A gift from my 2009 BGG Secret Santa!  Thanks Secret Santa - can't wait to play!

Finally got this to the table.

Played the Granicus campaign.  I found the game to be a lot of fun - there's a bit to think about, and a pleasant growth throughout the game.  The narrative the game evokes is enjoyable.  All around a solid solo game - good fun.

Played Issus - my opinion hasn't changed - a god fun solitaire game - easy to play and contains a good level of choices.

Preordered.  Looking forward to this as Field Commander: Rommel is a very cool game. :cool:
It's here!  (4/13/09).  I've opened the box thus far and a quick examination shows excellent components.  REALLY looking forward to this one as Alexander is THE MAN! :cool: :thumbsup:

Update: 1st play in and good impression thus far.  If interested, you can look at my comments under my recorded plays).
I gave this an initial rating for the first three games I've played.  I'll come back and give a final rating once I've played all the campaigns.  So far so good.  Looking forward to the Tyre Campaign especially since I enjoy Alexander at Tyre so much.

Further update: After 15 plays, I can honestly say that this is THE game for my Alexander fix, so to speak ;)  The layers of decision making are excellent and the choices each campaign are wide open.  You do not have to follow Alexander exactly to do well at the game.  Case in point: in my first linked campaign game, I had Parmenion and then drew the prophecy where I needed to elminate an advisor by a certain turn.  Rather than drive on north to destroy the rest of the Persian Empire, I swung east and hammered the Indian Kingdom of Porus, then went back an finished off the rump of Darius's empire.  This is a great game, one I am sure I will enjoy for years to come! :thumbsup:

One note: after much thought, I decided to lower my rating slightly.  The reason: I just can't shake the feeling that it's just not right that the enemy forces do not move at all!

Preliminary rating, full of clever ideas (as we would expect from Dan) and with nicely produced board and pieces. I am currently reading to get the zen of it. Solitaire games are a difficult genre, a bit like cooking a souffl√©.

Hey, not a bad light to midweight solitaire game. Quick and easy rules lead into pretty diverting gameplay with enough scenarios and choices to keep you busy. Gives a good overall ancients feel. If not for those nice mounted boards, it would be perfect to take on a business trip.

RATING: 7.5
Easy and fun.  The interesting decisions are mainly related to buying units and things (at least in the first campaign), but that's still enough to raise it above most solitaire wargames.

Rating may go up after I try the other three campaigns in the box.  It's unlikely to go down (the game is what it is).

The game box contains 4 hard boards of fine quality depicting areas from classical Greece and the vast Persian Empire to the present Indian border. The 15 page rule book is straightforward and easy to digest with examples of play. This is a light wargame with few counters having nice art graphics and enough to simulate Alexander the Great epic battles and conquests. This solitary play will allow you apart from the troops of that period to handle advisers, treasury, prophecies, battle plans, scouting, siege engines and refitting of units. You can play any of the 4 campaigns (Granicus ‚Äì Issus ‚Äì Tyre or Gaugamele) or link them together to simulate the whole history. The innovative mechanics will give satisfaction even to demanding wargamers.

This has a feeling, as odd as this comparison may be, of an old NES game. You're moving a banner on a map, rolling dice in a simple abstract combat and just having fun. It is a game that you just play and the random elements make it a different game every time.

A very enjoyable game that presents many decisions for the player. I love the movement mechanism and the way it forces you to think about your force size (bigger isn't always better).

It kept me thoroughly engaged through all the scenarios, though I did find it a little easy once I knew what I was doing.

That said my very first game of Granicus has to be re-run as Alexander got killed. The Tyre scenario ran right up to the last year (though I did complete the mole) and Hypaspades in the Gauagmela scenario very nearly finished me off!

Very glad to have bought this one!

The fighting is a bit abstract, no real diferences beetwen each unit roles, but on a bigger scale it creates a feeling of acomplishement and epic journeys. It¬¥s almost Euro-like in its simple mechanics (no tables to reference here per example), the counters are the most "wargamey-clich√©" aspect you¬¥ll find and your enemies aren¬¥t more than piles of armys waiting in their hometown. But, even if you don¬¥t come here looking for a wargame entry game, its a lovely and fullfiling game.

As far as solitaire games go, this one is one of the best I have found so far.  The component quality is great - nice gloss counters and mounted boards.  There are plenty of interesting decisions to make and the game has a wonderful narrative across the different sub-campaigns.  If I have a complaint it is that the game seems a bit too easy.  I can't wait to see where this system goes next.

I really enjoyed playing this game, the full campaign is a great way to play and does have an epic feel to it.  The full campaign doesn't take too long, it took me 4 hours only on my first play through.  There aren't a ton of choices, but those that you make is significant, the most important of which is the composition of your army and battle plans in battle and how to respond to your enemies armies.  

At the operation level, there is some tense moments as you decide how to approach the scenario.  Do you go for the prophecies or just go straight for conquest.  Do you plan to use those glory counters you earned to intimidate a city or do you spend them to gain "insights" that help you in battle (mostly).  The options at the operational level isn't quite as deep as I would like though.  But I did like how the battles work.

Good game but not amazingly replayable due to the lack of random elements and its very linear, but its a game I would come back to time and time again in the future, worth buying. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
It's fairly enjoyable for a few plays, but I don't find much replayability here. Even in the fourth scenario, which was my fourth session, I was getting tired of it.

All of the decision-making revolves around maintaining your numbers of troops. You don't want too many or too few, but it often doesn't matter what troops you have, as long as you have the right amount. Conversely, there's no real decision making about movement as there is generally only one or two possible paths.

There's a fair amount of wonky stuff that has you making nonsensical decisions. The one I remember clearly is that siege engines are simply better than the other infantry unit you can buy for 1. Combined with the movement / attrition rules, I found myself buying lots of siege engines even though I didn't want them for battles, because you need to move around with a certain number of units. Just seemed silly.

Solitaire game that feels more an "adventure" than a wargame. There are four campaigns included, and in each of them you must try to repeat -or improve- Alexander's success.

The enemy Artificial Intelligence is limited, but overall this is a nice game, with great components.

I can't exactly put my finger on the reason I like this game so much but I do. I think I've played this game as much as I've played any other solitaire game I have. It's very simple but just so much fun. I like the change of pace on the Tyre campaign just seems like it moves from a conquer the capital game to a strait resource management game. Just a load of fun abstract battle system but still has a nice historical feel.

I'm very inexperienced when it comes to war games, but I have a feeling I might like some of them. This one intrigued me because of the period and the solo play. It took me a couple of plays before I was not forgetting or misunderstanding rules, but after that I really like it. There is surprising planning and decision making involved before continuing the campaign, and the goal of earning points was more inspiring than I expected.

It is enjoyable, but waaay too simple. Granted i'm not bad in these things, but to get the maximum points on your second try is ultimately.. boring. :(

Sure you could play again and again to reach a higher score, but.. i don't know just for the score is not as fun as to accomplish it in contrast to fail miserably.

Maybe FG Napoleon is more challenging.

This is me dipping my toes into the wargaming water with an impulse pucrhase.  I very nearly picked up Phantom Leader a few days before in the local game shop, but then decided against it.

This ticks a lot of the boxes that Phantom Leader does (solo & campaign play, short play times), but the period is much more interesting to me and I think it's a more visually appealing game.

I'll probably save this for the business trip too.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Simple rules, good production values, and a playing time of about 60 minutes per scenario. Having 4 separate mounted maps was a nice bonus but they feel overly similar. You start on one side of the board and have very little choice about your path to the other side of the board.

All enemies are static and something about seeing Darius just sitting there with a massive army for years waiting for me to show up feels unsatisfying.

Each scenario has a couple of alternate rules that make things harder in exchange for more victory points if you win. However, since it feels like winning or losing comes down to the roll of dice (especially when scouting) more than skill it doesn't feel more challenging or rewarding.

The biggest source of failures in the game will be the scouting rolls. Get good scouting rolls and you'll show up at the enemy gates with lots of gold and a healthy army. Get bad rolls and your army will be weakened and your treasury empty. Since there is a "race against time" pushing you along you can't really do much rest and recuperation to make up for it.

The different "tactics" chits don't seem terribly balanced. I don't know that there is any reason to take anything but "Charge" which allows your Heavy Cavalry to attack every turn giving you a high probability of 2 hits each turn.

All in all, the whole experience just feels a bit overly mechanical. You take the shortest path available because of the timer element, you need to keep your army around the same size every play because of how scouting works, you usually want to deploy the same "tactics".

An excellent and fast-playing solo offering.  Single games completable in an hour (or less), campaigns easy to track over days.

The scenarios are great, and the map boards and markers make keeping track of everything easy.  I'm also really impressed with the components of Dan Verssen's games.  The counters are nice and thick and very durable, and the maps are mounted.

Okay, lets get the gripe out of the way....the boards warp.   A lot, and I haven't figured out how to get them back to normal.  Other than that, the components are great and the warped boards really don't affect playing, especially with plexiglass.  I like the system, there is a fair amount of tension, especially before big battles.  Watching Alexander improve and increase his empire is fun, and I think the best way to play this is as linked campaigns.

With all the rules options, I think this one has a lot of replayability in it.

There's a lot of nail-biting decision making in this game. I haven't been able to defeat Darius III at Issus in the linked campaigns version of the game yet, so I'm enjoying the game's challenges. One thing that bothers me about this game, though, is the lack of real victory conditions. I don't care for the "just besting myself in succeeding games" type of conditions. Such victories seem kind of hollow somehow.

This is an excellent solo game. You feel like Alexander III, tough choices, difficult decisions, fierce battles, great joy after an epic fight. The first scenario is to introduce you to the game mechanics, always play a linked campaign except if you want to practice before the real fight. I really enjoy it, i dont know about replaybility though, time will tell.

trade it since i ve finished/won all scenarios. It feels like a pc game, since i finished it i dont want to play it anymore, same thing as [thing=28829][/thing]

It was a great game for a few plays, with nice gameplay based on managing the resources of our men. I instantly loved the colourful maps and counters. Unfortunately, after 2 or 3 plays of single scenarios I started a full campaign with all (except one, I think) optional rules and gained a great score that I didn't really wish to improve upon, so the game went on a shelf and I didn't play it since then. Maybe I'll come back to it some time - it was fun, just not enough challenge and variety to come back.

Very fun solitaire experience. Exciting from start to finish, and the heavily themed gameplay mechanics and artwork make for a completely immersive game. It really does a good job putting you in Alexander's footsteps. Great components, mounted map boards, and articulate instructions for the most part. I'm not a wargamer and I was able to learn this rather easily.

RATING: 8
Alexander was one of the first 'war games' that I tried out, although some may dispute how much of a true war game this is. The boards look gorgeous and I find the Ancients subject matter interesting. It's very much on the lighter end of the spectrum, and I'm ok with that. There are no moving units on the board, which may sound a little dull, but that's been taken care of by the 'Scouting Roll' which brings the map to life a bit. The battle system is quite 'zoomed out' - unlike the more detailed battle system of Napoleon that takes place on a separate battle tactics board - but it is nonetheless a satisfying experience. In fact, that simplicity is somehow part of Alexander's charm. It's breezy and not loaded with minutiae. A perfect one for those solo moments when you get an itch for something historical but don't what too much brain burn.

Delightful game, with lots of colour added by various subsystems.  Probably the most interesting game on Alexander the Great since Mike Markowitz' Alexandros.  The interaction of Insight Markers, Advisors, Prophecies, and enemy strategies is inspired. Fun game, and decent history with broad brushes.

The only drawback in the components are the mounted mapboards - useless weight in what would otherwise be a perfect travel game.  They warp, too. Have replaced them by colour copies.

My first venture into 'true' wargames, and a very pleasant experience all told. It is a lot simpler and easier to learn than I had first expected, dispelling the myth that counter wargames are impenetrable and alien things, and it plays very fluidly. 

I got a very nice feeling of narrative as I led Alexander's army across Greece and Persia. The decisions you make seem limited at first, but both they and the small amount of randomisation in the game seemed very important every time they came up. Despite having such small boards for each of the four campaigns there was a pleasant sense of overall importance to the actions I chose and the choices I made, be it regarding ancient prophesies or my selection of battle plans (essentially bonuses and die/damage modifiers in a given battle, but which shape the battles immensely).

Surprisingly I would have liked a bit *more* meat to the game, and the campaign level lacked some of the personal drama of other solo capable games I own, but then I have come from the likes of Arkham Horror and Last Frontier: The Vesuvius Incident, which both pile on the grief at a personal level for each character or trooper, rather than a management one.

Overall it was a risk buying into a genre that I've never explored before, but this has lived up to my hopes very capably, and the replayability seems high so far. It is also blessed with what are well above average components for a wargame, so bonus points there DVG. Overall a very entertaining and easily accessible solo game, whether you consider yourself a wargamer or not. As a side note, if you have any interest in historical warfare of Alexander the Great himself add one extra point to the rating I've given, because it's all new ground to me!

Just completed a linked campaign. Awesome game. Subtle changes in the rules from Rommel seem to add a bit more strategy / decision opportunities that improve the flow of the game. 

Next play through I'll add in some of the optional VP conditions, which definitely seem like they would introduce a level of difficulty that should increase the replay value. (For instance, I suspect having to double your payment for movement points in the Gaugamela campaign may make the return trip to Babylon a bit more challenging)

RATING: 6
The game system seems to work better for "Field Commander Rommel" than for ancient battles, I think primarily due to the rule in which leaders fight each other: this is problematic when Alexander starts out and is at Strength 1: one hit and he'd dead and the game's over--just like that. 

So, there are ways around that and need to be taken into consideration. When and if Alexander piles up some victories and uses Glory points to build up fighting strength, he becomes pretty formidable--that is, until the 4th and last scenario, in which it's clear he and his forces are getting overextended. But therein lies the challenge.  

I do like the factors for gaining Glory, Gold, and Glorification for Alexander himself. Pretty easy to follow game play steps, as the 4-color, 15 pages of rules are well illustrated and pretty clearly written. 

As I laid out each of the game boards, however, in succession they warped quite a bit, arching lengthwise along the middle. Had to put several large rubber bands on each for storage in hopes that they would flatten out again, but even that doesn't take all of the 'bend' out.

I feel like the best way to play this is to do the scenarios in chronological order, to get a feel of Alexander's increasing and ultimately declining strength. 

My only caveats with this game is wondering how much replay value there is, and that at least so far (to February of 2013), it's not a game that makes me anxious to get back to the board to see what happens next.

Purchased January 2010. Sold March 2014.

Dice-fest, but can be intriguing with mixed die-rolls (if your luck lands at either extreme of the bell-curve, you'll either walk over the enemy or get stuffed).  Colorful, and it captures the spirit of the Alexandrian achievement/legend with prophecies, advisors, random insights that promote your abilities, etc.  Rulebook should be better (needs an FAQ or errata sheet to cover omissions); this seems to be a constant from this publisher and costs the game at least a point for me.

[thing=35350][/thing] is a very good game for several reasons: (1) solo play; (2) covers wide range of Alexander's campaigns with easy-to-play system; (3) introduction to wargames; and (4) scratches an itch on a topic without a lot of games.  However, some of its strengths are also a downside as it is a light "wargame" at best and only solo play.

A good solitary wargame. I realy love the hard boards. Those are well done with all the turn explanation on them. The only problem, and it's a big one for me, is that even if the game is more complexe than it's previous couterpart Field Commander: Rommel, it doesn't bring much to the game. The battle are much harder to manage compare to those in FC:R. The prophecies are O.K. but probably would have been better left out of the game.

Un bon jeu de guerre solitaire. J'adore les plateaux rigides ou les explications d'un tour de jeu sont bien indiqu√©es. Le seule probl√®me, et il est de taille pour moi, est que m√™me si les parties sont plus complexes que celles de son homologue Field Commander: Rommel, cette complexit√© n'apporte rien √† la partie. Les batailles sont plus dures √† g√©rer √† comparer √† celles de FC:R. Les proph√©cies sont O.K. mais il aurait √©t√© mieux de ne pas les ajouter au jeu.

This game stresses the power and importance of Alexander the Great's Companion heavy cavalry, as well as the mystical importance of divine prophecy and personal courage in fulfilling Alexander's 'destiny'. The Insights are incredibly powerful, but randomly drawn. Advisors aren't necessary to win, but they do add chrome. Battlefield tactics are confined to using Tactics chits.

It's quite easy for Alexander to die in the first few battles. If victorious, he soon becomes the most dangerous unit in the game, able to charge directly at an enemy commander and win the battle on his own. At that point, the rest of the army merely serve as 'additional wounds' for Alexander's unit.

Big disappointment to me. Felt cold and dry, and fell flat. Probably the idea of just beating my previous score, rather than sharp victory conditions, is not appealing enough to me (it is too easy to obtain basic success, I seem to remember, and then points are all that matter). For some reason, all the battles, prophecies and chrome, which I would usually dig, didn't do much for me in this one.

Worried about how much replayability there is going to be after I'm done with the 4 campaign boards.

Unpunched/unplayed, but boards are badly warped. DVG offered replacement when reprinted.

Neat little solitaire war game with a decent amount of flavour.  My initial reaction is that the die rolls in battle are overly deterministic, which makes the game highly luck based, but that might be my inexperience talking.

Super quick game, which is nice.  (At least it's super quick when I lose as badly as I have.)

Much easier than FC:Rommel, but also much more fun. Initial rating of 8.

RATING: 7
First solitary wargame I try.

The game is nice to try but I am not really immersed in the way of a classic face-to-face wargame. The fact that the enemy armies don't move makes this a puzzle more than a game.

Optional rules recommended to make it difficult enough :
Granicus : Memnon's diversionary attack ; memnon raiding fleet ; treasurer Harpalus
Issus : Memnon's diversionary attack ; Treasurer Harpalus
Tyre : Fireship ; Gaza defences
Gaugameles : Harsh Desert ; Sogdiana revolt ; Treasurer Harpalus

Prefer FC Rommel, despite the beautiful mounted boards. Not sure why but probably due to the time period it's set in.

I enjoy the battle resolution system but the overall flow of gameplay is too linear and the enemies are static.

Easy to see the connections to the predecessor in the series, [gameid=28829], particularly in the general supplies  vs. combat dynamic.  Still, there are some nice nods to the theme, particularly for sieges and prophecies.  Like in Rommel, luck in the early game can make a big amount of difference has a way of impacting the campaign in a big way.  Good luck early can set you up so that the rest of the campaign is a breeze, while bad luck can make the scenario unwinnable.  Generally, I would say this is a slightly better entry, though if you didn't like the first game, you probably won't find enough differences here to change your mind.  As far as light, solitaire wargames go, this is still one of the better entries out there.

This is a great low complexity solitaire game. The game comes with four scenarios that cover a large portion of Alexander the Greats career. Each scenario can be played in under an hour, but if you want the full experience you should go for the linked campaign. The system plays really easy and smooth, and differs [thing=28829][/thing] and [thing=42673][/thing] in that your enemies don‚Äôt move. The components are great. I really like the mechanics of this game, and I would have rated this game an eight, but because it is way too easy to win the four campaigns I've given it a seven rating. The fist two campaigns and the last campaign can be easily won in two rounds by running a blitz campaign and razing each pivotal area. I would recommend playing for the full linked campaign if you want any resistance at all. If I had to complain about one other thing it would be the crappy battlefield on the player log. If you haven‚Äôt already then download and print [filepage=77402][/filepage].

I was already a fan of the Rommel campaign version so this was a natural purchase.  It's a bit more in depth than the former but an overall richer experience.  As a solo game on the conquests of Alexander you can't go wrong.

Good solitaire wargame. Keeps you interested through the campaign, and a fair number of optional rules to choose from to add variety to following plays.

OK - for some reason though it has more decisions then Rommel it just feels bland and I don't get much satisfaction - especially the victory point system. Always a let down for me. Overall I rate it a 7 - seems like I should pull it down considering what I just said but it is a good game and I am generally willing to play - to give it another shot - and hope I enjoy it more. For a solo game - it is certainly worth owning and playing. I just think it could have been so much better with added chrome.

Right in between Rommel and Napoleon in terms of number of scenarios, complexity of rules, and decisions to make.  More interesting than Rommel, but combat is just a bit more than just choose battleplans and roll.  Dice roll luck has a big influence in how much you can move in a turn, which ultimately drives your victory points - more so that you battle strategy.

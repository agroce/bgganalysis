With ASLSK 1, 2, Beyond the Beaches, and a bunch of extra scenarios from various magazines. Lost as Germans in an error-ridden first-game scenario 2 where I didn't use equipment. Resounding win with them the second time round; absolutely marginal loss with them in scenario 3; resounding win with them in scenario 4.

It's crazy, fiddly, frustrating and brain-frying; I wouldn't have it any other way.

If you've made it this far through the Starter Kits then well done, you're one of the few to stick it out.  On the other hand if you're just starting out and thinking of making SK#3 your only purchase then stop! If you jump in the deep end you risk becoming overwhelmed by the amount of stuff to commit to memory.  Play at least 4 scenarios from each of the other two Starter Kits first, please!

Get ready for a taste of what ASL does best, combined arms!  Play as many infantry-only scenarios as you can before cracking this one; When you've had a taste of vehicles you'll never look back.

Update: Dropped my rating to 8 because full ASL consumes my time.

RATING: 6.5
Played first infantry only scenario. Complexity doesn´t seem to be that terrible (Add tanks and it will be roughly equal to GBACW). Overall it seems to be a nice package. Some stuff should be fixed however:
- Terrain effect chart seems to be from pack 1 (some terrain missing)
- Vehicle types should be bigger print (I know it´s ASL standard)
- Some unneeded complexity (e.g. the scenario cards should mention if grain/orchards are in season so you wouldn´t have to remember)

Edit: Played a bit more/with tanks. The tank /gun rules don´t feel quite as finished as the infantry rules (less rewrites?). The system feels very detailed/simulation heavy when describing hardware. However it feels like the "human factor" is missing a bit: Your guys have no problem of running into fire just to pull the defensive fire away from your main offensive. Overall it feels a bit too much like an action movie for my taste.

Tanks! At first I was hesitant: will the tanks add too much complexity for me? No way!

Very good bang for the buck you can get out there. 
This is a very nice intro game, but you better enlist an experienced ASL player in order to play, the supposed "newbye" rules are not so easy and very dense to digest. 
You don't have to start with starter Kit 1 if you are new to the system, better start with this one that gives you a lot for a very low price. 
What is better is that it gives you the key for the great and unique world of ASL, which is a complete game-world onto itself.

Well done and recomended.

While this is the most comprehensive rulebook for the ASLSK series, I also feel that it is the most unwieldly.  With all the rules they have added, the SK rules presentation is starting to collapse under its own weight.  That being said, it is easier to use this to learn AFVs, but I only approached this after playing infantry-only full ASL for a little while.

Mmmm, tanks. About time too. WWII squad level combat just doesn't seem right without them. Because of this, #3 is my favourite of the Starter Kits. Unfortunately, the stripped down rules compared to full ASL does leave a bit of ambiguity.
Scenario options are very good ranging from "tank on tank" battles to full blown combined arms actions. However one or two seem badly unbalanced unless my opponent and I are missing a key strategy tip.
I think I still prefer the old Cross of Iron since some of the extra chrome does seem to add anything to the decision making process, but this is a worthy replacement since its at least in print!

[b]Advanced Squad Leader: Starter Kit #3

A Great Introduction Into The World Of ASL, And Enough Of A Game For My Taste[/b]

ASLSK#3 introduces what everyone has waited for: Tanks! Panzer IVs, Tigers and Panthers, Shermans, T-34s, etc. pp. The scenarios are neatly arranged, starting with two tanks for each player and no infantry, allowing for full concentration on the movement and combat rules for tanks. Here is the issue, though. The tank rules are a pain in the ass. Start, stop, in motion, moving. The Vehicle chapter does contain one of my favourite rulebook quotes of all time thought: "An RST MA AFV is considered a ST MA AFV for TH DRMs except that it cannot fire its MA/CMG while the AFV is Crew Exposed (CE)." Up to this day I do not understand why they bothered with writing out CE...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Having just slogged through a bunch of badly-edited GMT rulebooks recently, my opinion of the ASLSK design and the way it is conveyed to players is sky-high. Yes, there are a lot of rules and a lot of things to remember but it all comes across with minimum fuss. This is as close to ASL as it gets. Of course, some things are left out and while they will be missed, it doesn't detract from the game. For example, while I will miss being able to carry Russian infantry on T-34s, it is arguably not necessary to have such rules in the game, as at this scale, the infantry should already have dismounted.

I love this rule book as a summary of how things work.  It's easy to scan and refresh your mind on many points. The vehicle rules seem less simplified than the SK infantry rules, and cover a lot of ground.  It really helped me learn tanks, but with all the Starter Kits, I prefer to use the great charts included with the full game rulebook.  The ASL charts are very developed and cover a bunch of stuff.   If Up Front had quality player aids and charts like ASL, the world would be a better place!


The ASL system, with all its data and research, is really quite and achievement.  It's detail may be an overkill to some but you have to admire the attempt by the folks at Avalon Hill to flesh out all aspects of WWII combat in one tactical system.  A huge amount of time and ink have been poured into this game.  Modern tactical wargames always seem to me like they cherry pick elements and concepts from ASL and try to repackage them into a smaller game.  It is a complex game but you can play it in small scenarios if you wish.

RATING: 7
ASLSK is hard to pin down.  It's a set of simplified rules that're still so complicated they aren't likely to appeal to anyone outside of the folk who would have given ASL a shot anyway.  Still, I'd rather play this than break out that godawful heavy rulebook any day and for what it sets out to do I think it succeeds. Gave up on real ASL, but still wish I had more chances to play this.

RATING: N/A
In a nutshell, the appeal of ASL is 1) Theme-rich: playing it is like watching the best kind of war movie.  2) The KING of replayability - scores of scenarios with new ones released regularly and 3) The game play is so rich that in order to be an expert, you must truely be a student of the game.

MMP did a great job with the Starter Kits: including just the right sub-set of the ASL rules to make a more accessible game.  This is what a few players of the Original Squad Leader Game were hoping that ASL would have been when it came out in 1985.

I'll state the obvious: SK#3 takes SK#1 & 2 to the next level.  : )

I like that the box contains everything that you need to play all the scenarios: the boards, counters and a complete rulebook.  SK #1 or #2 is not required.   The rulebook is in a more narrative style than the full ASL Rulebook, some like it, most don't.

The best value of the Starter Kits (all of which are exceptional buys) -- has all the toys including guns and tanks, plus three maps and vehicle notes. It is complex, however ... the systems of ASL aren't so complicated on their own, but when the systems come together you will find yourself scratching your head as a beginner. What seemed clear when read will prove less so as you try to puzzle out the interactions of armor, infantry, and guns. There is a chart here in the files section that breaks down AFV combat options based on phase and motion that eliminates a bit of the mystery, but you will still find yourself diving into the rules a lot, and as the Starter Kit rules aren't so well-indexed as the full rule set, you'll spend a lot of time flipping before you find what you need (if you find it at all). Still well worth owning and playing, and if you can knock off the scenarios in this kit you will have genuinely won your spurs for ASL and shouldn't feel intimidated at all about moving up to the full game.

It is the most complex tactical wargame there is & there probably ever will be. And if you don't mind (or actually happily looking forward to) reading 100 pages of rules, then this might be something you should look into.. but imho it has been surpassed by .. well by what actually?
Let's say there are much easier titles, and each has it's own shortfalls.. like CoH Conflict of Heroes, Band of Brothers & others.
ASL is using 6 different Phases to create the feel of simultaneousness.. but does only create complexity for complexity sake..

so for example in ASL you can move your units let's say around the enemy, while the enemy has no opportunity to move (they can shoot, but cannot move..). At least in CoH you could simply retreat your unit.

Also ASL knows no real hidden units, yeah you put questionmarks on counters but you still know where the counter is.. while in some other Tactical & block wargames you have no idea where the unit is..! These two things get me way more into the war-theme than to roll 6 dice to find out that the weather is not changing..

I've already bought magnifying glasses as play aids for other games (my eyesight is good, but some of my friend's eyes aren't) and I plan on using them for my games as I age. :smile: They'll be needed for the counters as there is a TON of information tucked away on them.

RATING: 5.5
01/12/08. Down to 6 from 9.
The problem with the ASL Igo-Ugo turn structure is that its model of fire and movement needs an overweening rules burden to model a battlefield dynamic which is palpably false.

That is to say: WW2 actions at the scale ASL represents simply DID NOT unfold with the simultaneity the modelling of which creates ASL's unique rules burden. WW2 firefights at this level ebbed and flowed in space and time, varying in pitch and intensity across the front and from unit to unit; as against which ASL generates a battlefield which clunks forward in implausible clockwork iterations. Moreover, the game doesn't actually represent ANY notional leader's perspective AT ALL, precisely because of the peculiarities of this unrealistic tempo of play.

These flaws undermine ASL's simulationist claims far more seriously than ASL fans are wont to imagine. ;)

Tanks are neat to see on the tabletop but they are irritatingly complex to use.  There is a lot more tracking of motion and die roll modifiers than I found convenient or comfortable.  Unlike the first two Starter Kits, we had to break the rulebook out fairly often to see what would happen in a given situation.  ASLSK3 definitely approached my limits for the detail I want from a tactical level game and the armored rules are more than I can keep in my head since I don't play the game regularly.

The two scenarios I tried (Clash at Borisovka and Ripples in the Pond) felt well tested but less interesting than the offerings in the first two starter kits.

Update after more solo play.   While there are a lot of clunky mechanics that slow play (delay MPs, unit substitution due to ELR,) there is also enough going on that the game is interesting.  I usually want to replay a scenario to try out different setups or tactics after finishing, which is a good sign.

Initial impressions while playing one scenario solo.

The ASL vehicle rules, even stripped down to SK standards, seem over-complicated compared to other tactical games.  A lot of the anguished decision making is involved with these overly complicated rules, like whether to stay in motion, which CRT to use (area, infantry or vehicle) and other stuff that seems gamey rather than realistic.  There is so much chrome involved that it is rather hard to learn the rules, so there is a lot of time spent flipping through the rulebook.

Even with those negatives, ASL is still the most complete WWII tactical game system with the most players.  So I'm determined to learn it and see if my enjoyment grows after the rules are more ingrained.

As a intro to full ASL: This game certainly does a good job of condensing the full ASL rules, but someone new to the system ought to start with ASL Starter Kit #1. 

As a stand alone product, some of these scenarios are amazing. The kit comes with 8 scenarios, and they include some of my favorite scenarios to date. "Last Ally, Last Victory" is a huge scenario, and a tough nut to cracked for the germans. In "Another Summer's Day," there is a very creative scenario rule that scatters American troops, and makes it difficult for the player to organize his defense. In "Monty's Gamble", the entire British force sets up hidden. Looking forward to playing that one against an opponent who isn't me!

Definitely recommend.

This is my first purchase of (and exposure to) any ASL product, and I'm really impressed; I think this is the most exciting, most accessible thing I've ever gotten from MMP.  Maybe that's because it's [i]below[/i] the complexity I expected, whereas the other MMP games I own have been [i]above.[/i]

I'm a little dubious about the degree of perfect information & the ability to exactly control each of your units (I thought this game was supposed to be [i]realistic,[/i] ha ha ha), but I was running through an infantry-only scenario within an hour of opening the box, whereas I [i]still[/i] haven't gotten to that point with the TCS titles I own.

Update: CC:E means it's "extremely unlikely" that this is going to hit the table anytime soon.  I do like tanks, and I do intend to try to get some of my friends to play this, but I don't see that happening for a while.

Update: this just wasn't getting played, so I sent it to Hilary.  Hey, he started it with Semper Fi!

I am really impressed by the Starter Kits.  Great job in taking a fraction of the full ASL ruleset and making a very solid ASL experience out of it.

The Starter Kits can be played by themselves for many, many years with a ton of enjoyment.  Or, a player can decide to go into full ASL and not have to unlearn a single rule.  Again, very good design decision.

RATING: 6
This starter kit never did it for me. I think armor rules are the system's Achilles heel. I played the first tank on tank battle on the East Front. It didn't feel right. We used a huge tutorial to get us going in the kit itself because by this point the rules had gotten too 'bogged down' to be easily clear. They might have taken a different approach in presentation to help out here. Tanks are definitely a full rules thing and players may want to skip this kit and move right into the binder to save time and money. (What?? An ASL player not own it all??? Are you nuts???)

The ASL world is deep (maybe TOO deep), but the Starter Kits bring it to an accessible level, while at the same time being a door to the Full (normal) ASL system. Wargaming at a very realistic level. Can be *really* frustrating when your opponent is laminating your troops. Imagine if the general is a generalette... devastating.

A good sequel to SK#2, for my taste better than SK#2. It introduces tanks, which give a new flavor to the game. 

Restricting the units to tanks, without halftracks or trucks reduces the rules a lot, also removing PRC, overruns, wreck blazes or CS the game is almost the same as ASL but with much simpler rules.

These starter kits really help ease the pain of learning ASL. When it comes to tanks I still prefer playing SL (with CoI) over ASLSK. If I want to play a complex tactical system with an emphasis on tank battles I think GMTs second edition of Panzer is far superior to ASL (at a similar level of complexity).  

If you are determined to learn ASL this is by far the best way to wade into the waters (but you will probably still need to find someone to teach you the game when you are ready to go past the SKs). Even though MMP states that ASLSK #3 is a standalone game with ALL the rules you will need you really should play ASLSK #1 and ASLSK #2 before tackling this one.

I give this an 8 because this is a top notch product that should have been released long ago. The rules are clear and well written with generous illustrated examples of play. Combined the 3 SKs give you enough rules, units and scenarios to stand on their own and offer years of fun without needing to move on to full ASL.

Just recently got this as part of giving ASL another try. I can't grade the rules for their friendliness to newbies, since I played tons of SL when I was a kid, through to GI: Anvil of Victory. Although I barely played ASL at all, I am very familiar with the basic system. That said, the rules seem very well done, and very approachable for the most part. If you have never played Squad Leader at all, you'll have to put some time in reading the rules, but they aren't all that long, and there are a lot of nice examples of play. 

This is a really nice overall package. There are 8 scenarios contained, from early war to late, eastern front and western front. They are all of small size, and all of the ones I have played so far have been fun. The scenarios remind me a lot of the ones in the original Squad Leader game. Very well done.

This is my first ASL Starter Kit, although I also have ordered the first one, and am awaiting its arrival. #3 is completely self contained (as they all are), and a big bonus is that it contains all the rules for armor and ordnance, so you are set there, as far as starter ASL goes.

I have been reading over my old ASL rulebook, and it really seems to me that the starter kit does a great job of introducing new players to the system. It's simplified, but all the core systems are there. (the armor and gun rules will require a careful reading....but if you can get a firm grip on these, you'll have the basic system in full ASL down) Not a big fan of how the rules are organized, it makes it more difficult than it needs to be to reference a rule. I would actually prefer the pure legalese of the ASLRB, funny enough. Even if you don't move on to the full ASL ruleset, there is a lot of game here. Kudos to MMP and all involved.

RATING: 9.5
An impressive, indeed brilliant package that gives you the core of the ASL system in 28 pages (actually a lot less than that, given the numerous illustrations and extended examples of play). Eight scenarios, three boards, Shermans and Joe Stalins and King Tigers, oh my. 

Those who are content to stick with the Starter Kits will find a mature game system that easily bests the old Squad Leader/Cross of Iron combo, and those wanting a bridge to full-on ASL will have it in their hands. For the ASL grognard, the map boards will be of particular interest--given the lack of walls and hedges they offer more open terrain than anything in the system outside of the desert, setting the scene for some long-range tank dueling.

My only nitpick is the decision, actually made back in SK2, to have custom entries on the To Hit table for each individual gun tube. That table is now the clumsiest aspect of SK3, and it can't possibly scale much further. Alright, one other nitpick: a slightly deeper box would have facilitated counter storage.

If you plan to move on to ASL, get this. If you only want to make one purchase, get SL.  This one is a big bite to learn all at once.

RATING: 8.5
The ultimate ranged-combat game.  I've looked long and hard for [what I consider] the best game in this genre, and I came back to the ASL system - in the form of the Starter Kits.  The ASL(SK) system offers a larger playing area (more manuver room) than its competitors, much more varied scenarios, a much larger variety of pieces and terrain, and much more detailed rules allowing for an almost limitless variety of tactical options.  There is a high price to pay in learning the game, but after that hurdle is crossed its well worth it.  Use Jay's tutorials if your learning the Starter Kits, they are very useful!
There is a lot of dice rolling in the game (used to simulate situations that may occur in actual combat - getting a vehicle stuck in the woods, gun breakdowns, etc.) which can effect one's strategy, but by using cards instead of dice the amount of luck-swing can be somewhat mitigated.  This of course assumes you care about such things.
The Starter Kits are a great game on their own.  Whether one goes on to ASL or not in my opinion is optional.  THe SKs offer a fully satisfying subsystem all on their own.

Edit 12/2/15 - During a closet-cleanout session I decided to let this one go, along with ~12 others.  As great as this game is, the complexity and rules density is just a little too much for me these days.

Ok, found somebody to teach this to me. That made things a lot easier! Not much more until the tank rules are mastered.
Then it's time for some full-scale strategy learning sessions!
Anyways, this game is just perfect - I gave 9 to SK#1, these are perfect additions to it but not as good by themselves. The whole system received the ten!

Edit: full ASL has taken my heart, less and less time I manage to devote to SK scenarios.

On purely practical and philosophical merits, I really do not like the starter kits. I know they are were an attempt to bring new players into the game but it does not work. It has been my experience that many people never advance past these and the resources that went into them should have been used to produce more real ASL products. To make matters worse, an additional expansion has been created to water done the system even more. If a person is to lazy to learn the game from the ground up they will never make the leap to real ASL. In summation, playing the starter kits is lot like masturbation, it might be nice but sex with a real person is a whole lot better.

The armor rules added in ASLSK #3 complete the ASLSK rules set, so I'm slightly more likely to play this one than either of the first two Starter Kits... but I still prefer to play full ASL.

The only tactical game better then this is the real thing, full ASL.  I think this was a great idea and does a fantastic job of making it much easier for potential players to ease their way into ASL, or enjoy without going into the full system.  This series is the 2nd best tactical series on the market.

This module does contain some of the hardest rules to comprehend overall (tanks) as well as a new level of tactics with the full combined arms.  I find myself more of an infantry fan which accounts for the slightly lower rating than SK1.  I feel this module is more for those that either had SL experience or plan on making the leap into ASL down the road.

I'm rather less keen on this Starter Kit compared to the other two. If you're planning on playing full ASL, I think this is the point where you just jump in and leave the SK's behind. While the SK3 rules do simplify the vehicle rules slightly, this is countered by the increasing awkwardness of the SK's "natural paragraphs" rules style. At this point, the rules are substantial enough that it becomes frustrating to have to look anything up in the rulebook. While the real ASLRB looks terribly intimidating, it's actually much, much more efficient to use than the SK3 book. IMO, SK3 is best left to those who have decided they definitely don't want to play full ASL but still want to push tanks around the board. But to me, that seems like a poor decision - if you can learn SK3, you're 95% of the way to full ASL, which offers significantly more fun and variety, even in the simplest scenarios.

Also, if you're thinking about actually *starting* with SK3, think again unless you already have significant WWII tactical gaming experience (i.e. Memoir 44 doesn't count). You will be very confused and unhappy. Start with SK1 and work your way up from there, preferably skipping this one and applying the savings to a nice new ASLRB.

The inf and oba rules seem mostly in sync with full ASL, but there is apparently a departure here, where you have to unlearn parts of this if you want to move on.  I'm just not sure I want to move to vehicles at all, given the complexity. More research needed.

Nice that you don't need any of the other ASLSK's to play it.  For those wanting to get into the vehicle rules aspect of the game.  I'm still challenged enough comprehending the system without them.  Good for folks like me who don't expect to progress beyond the ASLSK material.

2014 reprint 

It came with the old 2007 rulebook, not with the actual rulebook from ASLSK Expansion #1 or from Decision at Elst. :-(

It ASL. What more can a tactical wargamer want? And its marketed/packaged in a way to make it attractive an affordable; well, until you get hooked, and have to build a garage, a gaming table and storage for the rest of your ASL stuff.

Looks promising.  Armor really doesn't add too much complexity, and it seems like this is the SK to get.  We'll see how it goes.

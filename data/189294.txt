Sure, it's fairly light and yet another 'yatzee' game, but it does have some interesting choices and the 3D board is an attention getter.

I could see playing this game with my kids... pushing to catch the Yeti first and rolling dice to make that happen. Some dice are locked and then you re-roll. With enough blizzards, the Yeti takes off and advances.

Another Yahtzee style dice game. In this iteration there are tiles to buy and the ever present symbol you cannot reroll and which can mess you up. There are dozens of other games like this.

This was a fun, light game that is nicely suited to bringing out with non-gamers or newer gamers.  It's not incredibly complex or filled with tons of strategy, but I've always enjoyed the game every time I've played it, and I've played it multiple times now.  Sometimes, you just want to roll some dice and not overthink things, and this game is a nice alternative to a meatier "gamer game".  Recommended.

Family boardgame.
Climb the mountain - shoot the Yeti.
Not too easy despite it's a dice game.
3D components. Top artwork!

Yeti is yet another minor variation on the typical Yahtzee recipe. Nothing out of the ordinary with a possible exception for cute presentation.

Fun family game.  There is a randomness present, no doubt about it, but the offered choices are interesting enough (esp. with weather tiles (-> 'advanced' variant)).

Joining Augustus, Dream Home, Karuba and OctoDice on my shelf of 'simple yet challenging enough', smart and pure fun games.
Although it's slightly less entertaining than every one of them...

Sadly, the box is absurdly big...  I hate the size :-///

Fun, quick(ish) family game. My 6 year old loves it! Great components and good value. Anyone who rates this as something it isn't (it's a family game!) should take a good look at themselves in the mirror.

I feel like this is a game that has no idea what it wants to be.

It says 14 and up for the age, but I can't imagine anyone above the age of 11 wanting to play it. It's very simple, and the components are way too fragile.

Nice bits but otherwise a rather uninteresting yahtzee game. There is nothing to do out of turn, so there is quite a bit of downtime as well.

I LIKE This !! Instant Classic Family Game !! Light and tactical dice chucker (not Yahtzee) with good choices. The mechanisms nicely fit the theme of trying to find evidence of the Yeti with hopes to photograph it. Easy to learn and teach. Games go quick. Fast set up, too. Eye candy.

Players can play with or without a weather variant, but I recommend including it after playing without it at least once.

Family Game ! Beer-N-Pretzels Game !

Another play, this time with 3, reminds me again that this type of design in which die rolling is the main mechanism is not that engaging, unless a) the rolling is severely limited to the number of times (such as in Nations: the dice game), b) there is investment interest for the non-rollers (e.g. Settlers resource/Mmm placement search) or c) the rolling outcomes are either dramatic or humorous and the non-rollers enjoy the schadenfreude that typically most dice rolling inflicts. This latter aspect requires that either the roller does a running commentary or the non-rollers can easily 'see' the intent and make-up of the desired roll, best example being Exxtra compared to Can't Stop; and I feel in Yeti most of the intent is cloudy, just like a snow storm.

However, I cannot deny that this is one of the most charming and strongly thematic die rollers for a young family that I've come across, whereby the 'toy' factor of the mountain and the die faces together easily translates into the unique narrative of scaling the mountain (with the help of Sherpas, finding footprints and hopefully increase the chance of finding more by staying on the slopes overnight) or buying 'evidence' or assists (I like how the assists can be bought from other players and the previous owner is compensated with vps). 

Sometimes the weather can turn nasty, allowing the Yeti to trudge further away (a slight viewing disconnect here as the number of footprints found is the scoring track AROUND the mountain base rather than a trail on the mountain) otherwise it is the first player to sight the Yeti's backside and overtake it!! What is a nice touch is when the blizzard hits: 1 or more dice are 'frozen' on that rollers player aid, not being released until their next turn, reducing the next mountaineer(s) effort(s). Simple but so evocative.

This is a thoughtful dice chucker, trying to decide what type to put aside, what to spend your money on (vps or assists) which goes against the pace needed when playing with 3. So for me I'm happy if this remained a 2 player affair, best as an engaging number line rehearsal as it involves adding and multiplying. The fact there is a variant that adds good and bad weather clouds means there is some interesting variety in the pursuit.

Okay game. I liked the theme of it. I regret that only one die face had the coin symbol, which means taking photographs was completely outshadowed by simply scoring points through climbing and walking.

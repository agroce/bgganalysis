RATING: 7.5
We have seen titles before where the game tells the players a story (Tales of the Arabian Nights, Mansions of Madness, Mice and Mystics). We have seen games where players play cards (or dice) to inspire storys and develop ideas (Once Upon a Time, Rory's Story Cubes). Our RPG playing cousins have a long history of rolling dice to determine their characters fates, scribbling on bits of paper as they do so. But, we have rarely seen anything like Winter Tales: a card-driven story-telling exercise; where cards are not just inspirational images, but also resources to be horded, spent, bid, and bluffed with; where location on the lavishly illustrated map is not just a reminder of the story's setting, but also indicative of devious strategic maneuvring, as one team tries to bring their enemies down.

There's nothing else like it, and for that reason alone, it should be in many gamers' collections. However, it could remain on the shelf for a long time if no suitable players are around, so gamers should think carefully before purchasing. With the right group, it is an experience unlike anything I've seen in a board-game, and really quite astonishing.

Winter Tales provides a rich thematic setting for storytelling.  It presents some familiar characters (Pinocchio, Tin Man, the Mad Hatter) and others strangely altered (the White Rabbit now a grasping capitalist,  Alice recently released from an asylum). These folk struggle over a land of perpetual winter.  Will spring dawn at last or be snuffed out? Cards featuring children's line drawings provide inspired prompts for the imagination.

Less successful, I think, is the attempt to harness all this good stuff to conventional boardgame mechanics of movement, and conflicts resolved by playing more cards than the opposing side. However, if you are able to ignore the trivial concerns of winning and revel in the experience then Winter Tales has a great deal to offer.

The artwork is sensational and production quality is good.  My one gripe is that there is plenty of air in Winter Tales' big box.

I say only i almost cried for the emotions by playing this game, more than one time.

One time for the sadness of one player tale, One time for exaltation of one of my combos.

Lots of laughts also. 

I used it in some Screenplay Classes to teach students how to access to narrative ideas.

It could be better, expecially for the rule book, and for some rules. (-4 pt for this)

But it deserve 10 becouse if you play with right people is an experience that you will remember for long long time.
(+4pt for this)

And it could make some friendship stronger.
(out of scale pts)

Cool storytelling game with beautiful art and some actual gaming mechanics in there. The caveat is that you should play it with an even count of people (4 is ideal) since the Writer neutral role is pretty wonky. Used the Advanced Rules, and enjoy that lovely artwork and theme... It's like if Tim Burton created a Fables boardgame.

6 - good game. I have better ones, and I have far worse. I enjoy playing them once in a while

My friends have problems with storytelling, but with kids I work with it worked great. Didn't land on table to often - there are other games like this one with less required space and skill (some may say better). Sold it because of lack of co-players. I will miss it

RATING: 6
I’m sure there’s more about Winter Tales than I was explained at this year’s Essen, where I managed to play it only once: otherwise it would be almost unplayable but with a very limited group of close friends whose imagination is boundless and storytelling talent unequalled.

According to that experience, players are given too much freedom with just a few restrictions: the chapters or little stories you weave in order to stage the «grand finale» seem useless towards the outcome, a simple device to make the game longer (which I strongly doubt).

Moreover, players seem to have very little chances at intervening in the stories and interacting with each other: actually your movement and participation are limited by the number of cards you’re willing to discard and you don’t want to waste any of them, since you need to keep all of them for the game’s ending, when essentially the side with the most cards wins, no matter who won the previous chapters and how the final story sounds.

I regard myself a decent storyteller, thus had no doubt I’d love Winter Tales: yet the game I was confronted with looked like an ongoing prototype still needing a lot of work. Since I still can’t believe Story Tales is this banal, I’m really looking forward to playing it under a more reliable guidance: this game deserves better, as its stunning art pieces show.

RATING: 4
The game is brimming with theme, but it tries to hybridize storytelling with strategy/tactics.  And that does not work.  The winner is the player who plays the most cards, period.  The story behind it does not matter at all as to who wins.  Some could say that winning isn't the point, but why bother playing such a thematically charged game about the fierce war between two factions if you're not going to win?

Played once so far. It's interesting, and I think the experience will vary greatly depending on the players. You really need players who can have fun improving a coherent story. The game could be played by using tokens instead of story cards although using the story cards adds a lot of flavor to what would be boring actions. It drives you to pay more attention to the other players to hear the stories they tell in order to just move around the board.  It would be interesting to apply this mechanic to other games that use action tokens. You could imagine playing something like defenders of the realm and having to build a story that relates to what you're doing around every token spent. That said, I've rated it relatively low at this point because it's so dependent on the group. After more plays I expect my rating will rise as we try the advanced rules. I fell this needs a bit more meat to it at the moment. Very interesting mechanic though.

Of the build-a-story games, this one is the 'truest'. Basically playing for the sake of crafting a story, the rules are HIGHLY limited and the mechanic can EASILY be calculated.

I don't get this...game. It is a way to tell a story. Why not just sit around with some friends and each take turns adding to a story if you want to tell a story? 

Not much of a game here. Vague, subjective guidelines for scoring. The rule book tells you that it is not important if you win or lose. It is about telling a good story.

I guess it is a setting and inspiration for friends to come together and tell a story.

Hard to rate this game because it depends on who you play with.

There is a definite learning curve and it is unlike anything I have ever played, and that seems to be a common thing.

The artwork is fantastic, some of the best and the game can provide you with some very dark tales. I enjoy it a lot because it is more an exercise and really works on your imagination.

I would rate it between a 7-9.

Game mechanics is an epic fail. It is uninteresting and it has nothing to do with the storytelling theme. Look, you can play this storytelling game (!) without telling any stories (!!!)... nothing will change if you just play cards, keeping your mouth shut. Oh God...  True rating for this is 1/10.
On the other hand, the storytelling part is good. I like the art and how inspiring it may be. Twisted fairy tales are interesting too. The only question is what to do with all these riches. Playing with your own game mechanics? =) Hoorey, then it's a game designer package: invent your game based on the components provided...
One more thing,
Rules: awful. The game is easy, but the rules are covered with literary dirt, that makes them hard to comprehend. After you clear the dirt - you find out that some moments are not clarified. These rules are a lie. They try to convince you that the game mechanics has storytelling inside, while it does not. The problem is - you have to read through all this.

Interesting story telling concept. I am loathe to use the word game here as there really isn't much game here other than a very simple card management game. 

The entire concept revolves around the story telling which is done through cards with depict doodles by the designers children and in classic children's doodles fashion you can orientate the card whichever way you chose and with a good dollop of imagination that doodle can become anything you want it to be.

I really like this novel approach to the story cards but this game suffers in the same way as all story telling games, if when put on the spot a player struggles to "imagineer" what is going to happen next. 

This is significantly different to anything else in my collection and therein lies its appeal.

[i]It started with a prison shanking and ended with the detonation of a two-angels-fucking superweapon.  Somewhere in the middle there was an ecstatic frenzy over a heart-shaped box carved from a magic tree, a zeppelin assault with tin-man–firing cannons, and a puppet show no one will ever forget, no matter how hard they try...[/i]

This is what I like to do in pretty much every game, formalized and made the entire point of the exercise.  The rules are somewhat obtuse and seem at odds with what they're trying to achieve, which is probably why this beautiful experiment fails so often for so many, as it's a fragile thing that requires the right people to play it the right way with the right mindset in order to properly come together, inflate with hot air, and soar.  But man, if you can pull it off it's slick as hell.

Just ignore any gamey, fun-murdering card counting bullshit and focus on the storyteller's maxim:

[b]SOMETHING WENT WRONG[/b]

And everything'll be just fine.

Or not.

[size=7]Note:  For our first game we just kinda went for it—there were plenty of rules irregularities but the story came through intact and everyone had a fine time.  For our next game I'll suggest playing cards into a stack instead of a line so the magnitude of cards isn't reflexively obvious, and maybe judging the "winner" of the story-bit with a vote, using the number of cards played as a tie-breaker.  While a vote won't work in mechanism-focused super-competitive groups (who shouldn't be playing this anyway) it will for us, as we prize a good story over winning or losing.[/size]

This is a story-telling game which has had some odd hand-management rules and scoring system Frankensteined onto it.

The only problem with the game is that it could be less exciting with the wrong people. With people who has resistance against the type of the game, or who don't have the attitude[or don't want] to dip into that deep, dark world.

Of course it comes from the type of the game, and it's not the game's fault.

In Winter Tales, a storytelling board game, players tell the tale of the conflict between the characters of fairy tales, who represent all that is good and hopeful, and the Soldiers of Winter, who incarnate evil and the fierce cold of Winter. Players will ally themselves with one of the warring Factions, controlling characters and fighting for the comeback of Spring or the suffocation of all hope, bringing on an endless Winter.

Winter Tales is an ever-changing game as each time the players will tell a completely different story, creating a shared plot.

The Good: The artwork is gorgeous! I love the fairy-tale theme and really wanted to like this game because of those elements.

The Bad: And it is reeeeeeeally bad. The player interaction is idiotic. There are no rules or boundaries. you just make up your own story of what a card means to you and as long as you have more cards than your opponent, you can win... whatever. Just asininely stupid. What a waste of good artwork! 

If you feel you need this loose framework of a game to tell a good story, then I fear your imagination is lacking anyway. A better option is to have some friends over, get drunk, and tell stories based on Dixit cards you draw randomly ... now that actually sounds like some good storytelling. This has got to be THE WORST GAME on the planet. The ONLY reason I would consider "playing" (that's a joke) this over tic-tac-toe is the artwork.

Very elegant story-telling board game that successfully mergers some board game mechanics, given actions and phases to free-form story telling. The characters provided with the game are dark twisted versions of their bright and cheery fairy tales originals, and with the world is a package very inspirational and conducive to soaring imagination.

This might also be the game's drawback since the characters and world are so well pre-defined, and as such might reduce long-term re-playability.

The game is to be praised and lauded for very effectively providing game mechanics just right in form and function to guide the creation of mutual stories: the mechanics never get in the way of the story telling, and the stories always have a path to follow because of the rules and mechanics that support and guide them.

Highly recommended to all fans of story-telling games.

Bravo Albe Pavo for creating what I would consider one of the best and original games I’ve ever played. In fact, I would say finally that Winter Tales is a SPECIAL game. With sooooo many games coming out, especially on Kickstarter, which are re-treading the same tired themes… (I’m looking at you Zombies!) it was such a treat to find a, dare I say, unique and creative game.

It looks amazing with its Tim Burtonesque art…

It oozes theme and facilitates the players developing the theme even further…

It has a genuine sense of fun… with it’s twisted world of not so straightforward, characters…

It has a simple card image driven engine…

It plays very well with the right group, with no down time for any players…

It has huge replay value… and I can’t wait to play many more times to further explore the great potential for more fun and creativity that Winter Tales represents.

Not much more I can say other than thank you so much to Albe Pavo for a work of sheer awesomness. I’ve never done this before but I feel compelled to announce that – This is my official GAME OF THE YEAR for 2012!

This is the furthest "game" from a boardgame that I have played. Yes, there is a board, cards, pawns etc. BUT they are just the mechanic system, the real "game" is the story that the players generate between them.
This needs to be payed by people who can accept this game for what it is and are willing and able to create fantastic stories straight from their own heads and then this game really works well.
I'm looking forward to my next play.

As much as I love the theme and overall presentation, there isn't a game in this box. There is simply a premise and a very loosely assembled rule set that results in winners and losers based on what cards you draw and how creative you are. It feels like Fantasy Flight wanted to take something like Once Upon a Time, and blow it up into a big box game. There isn't even enough variety in this box to where you will see different quests from game to game. On top of that, I really felt like so much of this game was disconnected from its other parts that any storytelling felt forced. Avoid.

Would rather play Ace Detective.

An oddly complex narrative-focused board game that plays MUCH better with an even number of players. I say this game is complex because the way you play your cards (which only show an image that is up to your interpretation) changes depending on when and how you play them. There are also a surprisingly large number of various other rules for a narrative-focused board game.

For the aforementioned reasons, this game has been sold.

I simply waited all my life for a game like this one. 
Rate 9,5 just because i would like to have Peter Pan in the game, but who knows, maybe they'll release an expansion someday..
This game makes you dream..

Some people like games in which you create a narrative.  It just isn't for me. I don't really see the attraction of this game. However, I'll give this a .5 bump for the great artwork.

This is a really unique storytelling game, where the emphasis is in the shared experience of creating a good story rather than in the strict 'winning'. I think it works best with people willing to get into the spirit, and may be a game that one had to be in the right mood to play.

Do not believe the negative hype about this game.  It is quite entertaining.  The mechanics have to be approached as a story generator and not as an exercise in winning.  It would be a good game to play with light gamers or role players.  If the players are focused on winning the system can be gamed, but the arbitrator should put a stop to that.

Beautifully illustrated dark fantasy storytelling game. The key mechanism involves players using scrawled icons (literally created by children) as inspiration for moving the game onwards -- a crude illustration of scattered cross-marks could be twinkling stars, marks on a map, caltrops, jewels in a safe, fireflies dancing in the woods...

It's not really a boardgame, it's more like an unconvential RPG with no GM. The system provides constraints about how and when story cards can be played, and there is a framework to allow one team to "win". Everything except for the cards seems a bit fiddly to me, but they're a stroke of genius: inspiration, constraint and Rorschach blot all rolled into one. As for the setting, I like the idea and not the execution (a little too grimderp) and am not inclined to spend my time there.

Played a demo in Essen. So rating is preliminary.
But that demo went great! We had a blast telling stories.

Should be played with the right crowd, though. If you are fan of role-playing you definitely should give this a try. Bonus is that it might draw non role-players into it as well!

Theme is brilliantly done, guided storytelling is very well designed. Wonder about the movement boardgame part of the game, though.

I think I had payed $50 for this game I'd be disappointed, but I really like this game. It has a great theme. The dark fairy tale feel is just great, and it's a very strong story telling game. Now, it is basically just a storytelling game, but it works really well as you battle with the forces of winter and spring vying for the world. There is more complexity to the game than just storytelling, but the storytelling is probably the most fun part of the game.

Just an overall bad game in my opinion. The rules were complicated for what the game was trying to be, in our first game, a weird situation came up that was misinterpreted by multiple players, and the rule book could not address the problem. It was sometimes funny, but just felt broken.

RATING: 6
This seems like it could be really fun if you had a whole day to play and played the long game with all the advanced rules and a full compliment of 7 players who were all really good storytellers and were all really into it... So... we probably won't get to play this game much...

It's a game I need the right players for, of which I'd be one. Though the story telling is the theme of the game, there's a strong hand/card management aspect that appeals to me more, especially with the special token abilities. I see this game playing well even without building a credible story. Even though the winner(s) of the epilogue win the game, winning memories or chapters os critical at they give you 3 additional points toward the final win tally.

This game has a lot of potential, but it never comes together in a satisfying way. The story-telling mechanic on it's own could make a great game, but it's so bogged down with rules it saps all the fun and creativity out of it. This game could work when played by the perfect combination of people. That group would have to include people who, despite that the game sets up specific mechanics that allow you to win by playing a certain way, would willingly play against their best interest on occasion for the sake of the story. I tried playing the game that way, but it just didn't work for me. It's a shame that this game never really comes together, because it's got some beautiful art and a great setting. These, unfortunately, do little to change the fact that it just isn't a very fun game.

so funny! 

I've played with family a wonderful Winter Tales game! 
It was so easy to understand even for children (9 years old, with an adult 'rules support'): and the game run smooth creating incredible stories!

Our gaming group choose the simple basic rules: no Modules. 1 hour of game: fast and deep.
I really need to play this game once more!

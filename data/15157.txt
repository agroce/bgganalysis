Ah, Stefan Dorra... your hits are brilliant, but your misses are rough. This game is ok, but there are a few non-intuitive rules that ticked off my opponents. If you like being able to do something concrete each turn, you will be frustrated with the amount of saving up you need to do in order to purchase new huts. The base three money system also seemed to frustrate. The worst offender, however, was the method for determining turn order. While it makes sense mechanically, it really seemed to bother my opponents.

I will hold onto this game since Dorra is my favorite designer, but I really don't see it making it to the table much.

Pleasant game of path-building and set-collection.  I liked the limited hand of "bidding" cards and how they increased in value, but the price of everything grew at around the same rate.  Not sure how much it will get to the table, but it was polished and accessible.

3 plays.  Very cool.  the opening is super-critical to doing well, if you get trapped and have to pay 3 gold instead of 2 a number of times very early, youre pretty much out of it, sicne you wont get as much income, and will get a lower 'one of each type' score number.

Takes only ~30 minutes!

I'm hesitant to rate many Mayfair Games to avoid shilling (or, perhaps, gloating for low ones), but Amazonas is a game I enjoy playing and teaching as often as possible. The exploration theme really disguises a slick economics game, with maximizing every income round as important as collecting animal samples. And a big, beautiful board!

This game provides a moderate amount of fun as you make your way across jungle paths (and water paths) in the Amazon, building huts for gold pieces and acquiring specimens which, at the end of the game, earn you victory points if you have at least three of that particular specimen type.  Event cards, a race to acquire each type of specimen, secret goal cards, and the selective use of income cards add a little bit of variability to the game, but overall, this is a fairly modest feeling game.  This game might work better with younger players than seasoned gamer types.

This is a tough game to evaluate.  On one hand it is a solid brain twister of strategy.  On the other it feels like it has too much luck.  The initial 'secret mission' cards are troubling.  Any one individual card is rarely a problem, but as a collective group for all playes, the luck of the draw (relative to others) is critical.  The basic turn mechanics are solid and work very well.  The game play is enjoyable, but after many losses, I still have no clue how to beat  the initial card draw problem.  Frustrating...  [GTI Code: TGxD]

The Indian tiles are jokers.  The cards are uniquely and sequentially numbered.  In the case of a tie the highest (or was it lowest) card wins.  So the player playing blue can always win top card ties and the therefore the Indian tiles.  The same problem as arises in Die Gnumies.  The game is broken as it is but could easily have been fixed, for example by referring to the number on the card below as a tie break.  Much of the rest of the game is also negative, with penalties or restrictions.  A shame for such a nice looking game.  Broken and not much fun.

RATING: 6
Tentative rating after 1st play. Tight money management. Would need additional plays to figure out good initial placement and efficient 2nd and 3rd builds. Getting early diversity is probably better than early specialization. Would be willing to try out again to test some strategies out... I'm not sure about how *fun* the game is though.

Surprisingly fun and can be a good thinker as you plan out your potential current and future moves.  Rationing your possibilities to maximize each round only to find you don't have enough pieces to execute your end game is a good formula in my book.  I found it for $5 at a thrift store.  If you can get it cheap, it's a good investment you will play more than once if you want some light tight themed fun with decent nuance.

The connection game genre is already glutted with too many worthless entries and Amazonas just adds to the clutter by commiting the same mistakes as its brethren.  Gaming is about player interaction, something that the designers of the multitude of connection games forget.  Fundamentally, Amazonas possesses no glaring flaws, it just plain bores me to tears.  The blind-bidding barely qualifies as a bid.  I guess you could attach importance to turn order, but it never seems to matter much.  You can't actively block without knowing their connection card.  The negative points for missing your mission are huge for something that you will likely miss not by your opponent's directed malice, but by their random choice for a point at the end of the game.

Despite this, it could be good if there were actually some interesting decisions.  Unfortunately, neither bidding nor building elicits much in thought, reminding me of Ticket to Ride in how the game seemingly plays itself.  Completely worthless addition to the hobby.

RATING: 6
I like the basic idea, but there's not enough ability to predict what other players will do, so it ends up feeling a little random.  Just grabbing cheap spots in uncontested areas doesn't seem very gratifying.  I think the game would be better, too, if the bidding cards were better balanced.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Mostly harmless game of route-building and set collection.  Easy rules and gameplay make it a good choice for families and casual gamers.  Lots of luck in the event cards (and luck in where your opponents decide to play huts), thus it is a game of tactics (not strategy).  Scores are very tight so it is important to claim your "one of each specimen" bonus tile early to get more points than your opponents.  Later in the game, it becomes cost prohibitive to try to reach your secret locations... especially with 4 players (the max).  

=======
OTHERS SAY... Set collection, route-building, luck-heavy, blind bidding, tight money, better parts of TTR.  Powergrid boiled down with no tension.  You know where you need to play, it's obvious.  Each turn an event card is drawn, and many of them can mess up your plans, so it can be a bit frustrating.  Could be better if it had expansions such as... (1) larger deck of Secret Mission cards that would avoid experienced players from memorizing the missions, (2) multiple sets of Event Cards could be flavored to give it more variety (with different sets, players could choose which set to play with or even which combo of events to play with), and (3) expansion boards or modular pieces that make up a board could be fantastic.

The board itself is quite attractive, but I find this game to be a little tight on the money.  Also, a lot of it comes down to how lucky you are with the order that symbols turn up in the deck.  If what you're collecting comes out late, then yay for you.  Otherwise, sucks to be you.  Finally, the scoring is such that it's very difficult to get ahead of anyone else.  All of the scores in our first game were effectively tied.  Shrug.

I almost gave this a bonus point for the nice graphics but this is really a fairly unengaging connection game and my score has to reflect that.

Basically, you need to get to certain areas and to collect sets of three along the way if possible but there is no real way to tell where other people want to go and even if you did know it would be nigh impossible to block because of the myriad of ways that one can get from point a to b in this game.

Would probably make a good family game, but not my cup o' joe.

I like Amazone. It is a quick and light game, but since money is a tight resource, the game can force quite a few nasty decisions on you. Once players are in the playing rythm it also plays quite quickly, making it an ideal warming-up or cooling-down game. The graphics are bright and cheerful, and simply quite inviting to play with. Marring the otherwise good design are errors in the white tie-breaker numbers on the cards which in the German edition are skewed towards particular colours; and somewhat imbalanced secret assignment cards which make things too easy for some, and too difficult for others. Nevertheless, I forgive the game these flaws because I've not felt them to be very problematic in practice; and even if they were, I play the game not sufficiently often to notice them. 

[b]Update[/b] The game improves with the majorities-variant suggested in the rules.

Set-collection and network-building with a tight economy. Interaction between players is indirect via income cards and competition for the cheapest huts. Every round there's an event that affects all players, it's mostly minor nuisances but sometimes it can lay the best laid plans to waste. Production is good and colorful, but the game is somewhat lacking in the fun department.

Components: Absolutely beautiful board and cards. The iconography is fairly clear, but I am bothered by the gold nuggets at each village, not just because they are in a different denomination than my income, but because they are difficult to see from a distance, especially once one or two huts are obscuring them.

Experience: On the one hand, this is an interesting budgeting and racing game. But on the other hand, I have no idea what my opponents are going for, and so I have little information around which to plan, to either conserve or expend my resources. Basically, I am just progressing as I can, and periodically am thwarted by my opponents without warning. I do, however, enjoy the set-collecting, and finding my own way through the Amazon.

This game has very nice components and I like the event card deck also. But there it stops ; there's nothing else original in it and the choice of starting location is much too deciding. As the starting player you might get locked by the others ; as the last player your options may be too small. In both cases you can already have lost the game after 1 minute, which makes the rest of the game not enjoyable at all.

This brightly colored, quick-playing, lazy feeling game masks a fierce tactical battle game.  There are no "master" strategies, but players have to eke out an extra coin in a lot of little ways in order to succeed.  Collecting specimens to maximize victory points is the stated goal, but also maximizing money generation and turn order control to jump on small hut placement advantages is key.  The theme is beautifully rendered on the board and pieces and well integrated with goal of the game.  A real sleeper, unlike many 'fad' games, this one never seems to burn out, finding its place at the table through time.

Players explore the Amazon, gathering tokens in five suits (orchids, fish, etc).  Players simultaneously play a card that determines turn order and income received.  Income is used to expand your network of camps across the map.  Do this for around 20 turns and assess points.  Points are earned for variety of chips; collections of chips that are three or more in size; and achieving your secret Elfenland-like destinations.  Felt like a boiled down Powergrid/Funkenschlag, with no tension.  Decisions tended to be rather obvious where you expanded to.  Happy to play it, certainly nothing wrong with it, and the presentation is gorgeous.

[Dorra] Harmless game of "grab that route before the other guy makes it too expensive". It it a straightforward working-man's-eurogame: you optimize your own stuff (bid cards), interact with other players (route costs rise after others take them) and you manage random events (event deck).
 
I'd highly recommend for playing with people new to the hobby, but it's not a particuluarly engaging game for a group of veteran enthusiasts.

This could not of been more dull. Half the time was wasted figuring out turn order (which never seemed to matter when half of the turns were collect money and pass). Event disasters are too random and mostly unavoidable.

Been along time since I played this (7 years!). I kept thinking it was more complex than it turned out to be. It's really very easy set collecting and very quick and easy to play. There's something too in the design, it's actually quite a tight economic game, in that the longer you take to reach certain villages, the more expensive it is. The 18 turns flew by, and it all felt very good.

***


Put my rating up to 8 now. Played again against 2 new players (and won!), enjoyed it loads. Very fast game, 18 rounds fly by. Very quick decision making, works better with 4 players, more competition. I like the self-timing to deliver income. *** I might rate this higher after another play. Despite losing badly, I enjoyed the game a lot. I made a mistake of keeping to jungle paths when I could have made faster moves using river crossings. 18 rounds seems like a lot, but as the game progressed, it became obvious that things were tight. I should have played better though, so I'm keen to give it another go. The translation on now is good enough, but we had some questions.

It gets a 6 for its beauty. otherwise a 5.  The is for 3-4 players.  But with 3 people, everyone made their secret mission with ease and the winner was the one who got each kind of specimen first--Just an uninspired race.  Doesn't work with 3--hopefully 4 players do. Very disappointed.  However, not a bad game for non-gamers & now that I think about it, a good family game for a range of ages.  This is similar to Celtica, but I like Celtica better.

Received on April 28, 2005. Played once that day. So far, it's only so-so. We played one rule wrongly (players designated their "native" as a replacement for a specimen they hadn't collected, making it easier to get 5 different specimen before others). Further, we soon saw the "sweet spot" on the game-board map, but it was too late as the one who started there had an overwhelming advantage over the others. That, of course, will be corrected with further playing.

A nice enough and attractive game that goes down well with lighter players after Ticket to Ride etc. There are a couple of confusing points that need explaining carefully. First, you are paid in silver but have to buy huts in gold. Second, the native tokens and native bidding card are not to be confused. The native token is just a specimen wild card, it doesn't protect you from bad events.

I bought it because it was a Dorra, it was on sale, and it looked beautiful.  Thankfully, it is also a very good game.  Although you "make discoveries", this is NOT an exploration game.  Rather, you build a network of locations, representing your discoveries in the Amazon.  The combined method of income and turn order is rather clever.  

However, I highly recommend the designer's suggestion of using the 1-4 number cards to break ties for turn order (similar to [b]O Zoo le Mio[/b]) instead of the unbalanced "priority numbers" printed on the cards.

Very pretty game to look at.  This was enjoyable to play and interesting to watch as your bidding changed based on what sets you have collected.  It seems quite possible to really hurt yourself early on if you aren't careful, and money is always tight.  As much as I enjoyed it, I question the replayability of this game.

Καλό παιχνίδι, αρκετά θεματικό. Μου άρεσε η ευκολία των κανόνων και το έντονο κυνήγι για resourses. Δεν μου άρεσε η συνεχώς παρόμοια ανάπτυξη του κάθε φορά που το παίζαμε (replayability γιοκ) καθώς και ότι οι κινήσεις(actions)σου είναι αρκετά περιορισμένες. Ότι πρέπει για non gamers και για μια light βραδιά.

Amazonas is a pleasant family game that also works as an end-of-the-night choice for gamers.  It plays quickly, and offers some nice light decisions about timing the use of your bidding/income cards, pacing your expansion, and speculating on the order of the event cards.  I'm worried, though, that the game will get "samey" with repeated play.  I noticed it happening even as soon as our second game.  There may not be enough variety to the strategic approaches open to players.  You'll decide whether to strongly specialize in a species or two but basically there's a formula for success.  Most of your moves are strongly constrained by the need to visit all four of your scheduled destinations.  Is it possible to win without doing so?  Perhaps, but I won't believe that it is until I see someone pull it off.

Interesting play and theme, although I have a feeling that it partly is selfplaying. You prefer to start at one of your goal villages, then you try to pick your others asap. Then you try to race for all types and then you go for at least 3 of each in some types. A few years ago I wouldn't have hesitated to buy the game, but I probably won't buy this one.

RATING: 7.5
The game has a bit more of a learning curve than you initially expect and it can be very unforgiving of mistakes. 

Underneath the pretty pictures is a very tight economy. You have to pay careful attention to that economy, which affects where you build your research huts and which tiles you collect, from the very beginning. Making one mistake can throw your whole game plan. 

Still, the game is solid.

This is a very neat (and very beautiful) game that is easy to bring to the table. It's great value for the time spent on playing it. The subtle interaction in the placement of settlements is more important than what it might appear in the first games. It plays nicely with 2 players as well.

A growing concern of mine, however, is that there's a strategy that "always" leads to victory: Consistently grabbing the cheapest tiles (that cost 2 gold). If you can win repeatedly by doing this while paying no or little regard to any other considerations (collecting sets, etc.) except for fulfilling your secret mission by the end of the game, I would have serious reservations about the game. And the designer's proposed rules (in which you also get points for majorities) appear to be making such a strategy even more profitable.

Nice game with interesting decisions, where you build huts to get animal tokens. You must take several factors into consideration when you choose where to build: access to other building sites, animal to be collected, cost, your secret mission (villages where you must build) and position of other players' huts. It's also important to know when to play the higher cards to get more money and the right to build first, or when to use the native card to avoid the effect of negative events. And when the natives themselves appear, you need to decide whether to take them and possibily forfeit a high income; sometimes you'll prefer the money, but that usually means the next player can get the native for less.

Had this game for months, finally brought it out to play and was pleasantly surprised.  Easy enough game to pick up and read through directions and play right away.  Although I did find out later that you cannot pick up the chief token and use it as a speciment token that you don't already have.  You can only add the chief to a specimen you have.  Still, the game played well, and hubby and child wanted to play again. AMAZing.

Ugh, why are we worried about deforestation if this is all the Amazon has to offer?  Of course, this is not the worst game I've ever played, but it is a disappointing title from the usually reliable Stefan Dora.

Player interaction is limited to filling city sites in order to block a third or fourth player.  The reduced card bidding is very reminiscent of Niagara, and it works here as well.

Let's call it "Medieval Merchant Lite".  It has the same mechanic as MM, in which players develop cities along pre-existing paths drawn on the board.  However the economic system is *much* simpler.  It is also much less nasty.  Everyone in a city gets its benefits, with the difference being that the cost to develop a city increases with each additional player.

If it can indeed be played in the 50 minutes advertised, it could prove to be a reliable light-ish game.

Good looking board, cards and tiles; evokes theme well. I look at this as more of an asset planning game than a road building game. Careful planning can mitigate the worst of the bad events. I really enjoyed playing this, but question if the replayability will match up to the price tag.

Update after a second play: Even the most thoughtful planning cannot mitigate bad luck. The order in which the event cards get drawn can have a huge influence on your success. This is not a criticism, but rather a complement in that the game will have surprises in store for you every time you play. There are some nuances still to be discovered: Where are the best starting spots? Are any of the goods inherently higher valued? What is the value (in lost income) of the villager tiles? I like it!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Rating could go up with subsequent play.  I like how the tension mounts as the game progresses.  But still, there aren't too many choices to be made, which seems to limit the replayability.  I'd like to play it again, though.  Needs to be played quickly, seems like it should take 45 minutes tops.

A game about collecting specimens in the Amazon. After a first read of the rules, I was disappointed. It seemed like such a light game (just another Euro - lots of wooden bits and abstract gameplay). However the actual playing of the game makes for a different experience. There's a lot of tension in the game, this rushed feeling to visit as many huts as possible before the other players do. And because money is so tight, there's the constant decision-making of how to best spend your money.

Excellent game -- fairly simple rules, nice artwork and tense gameplay.

Played once, 4p.  Totally unfun set collection game, with an additional hidden goal mechanic.  There are 5 different tiles to collect, as well as money to but those tiles.  You play one of 6 cards to acquire money, and to determine turn order; cards are used once until all cards are used, then returned and used again.  The problem is the event deck which will always disappoint some of the players and please others.  Hopefully, this averages out over the course of the game, but it never works out this way, since you don't have enough actions over the course of the game.  Very disappointing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An intriguing little network/travel connection game.  Card play and planning for when each particular event cards arises seems as important as knowing which knowledge tiles to try and collect.  Grabbing huts early is the most economic path to excellence.  I kinda like it, but really want to like it even more than it basically is.  I think the game would be greatly enchanced and better served with an Expansion Set (publisher/designer: hint, hint) to add *more* replayability and flexibility to groups' tastes.  For example, there could be a larger deck of Secret Mission cards that would avoid experienced players from memorizing the missions.  Mutiple sets of Event Cards could be flavored to give it more variety (with different sets, players could choose which set to play with or even which combo of events to play with).  Expansion boards or modular pieces that make up a board could be fantastic.  It's an open enough game (like Ticket to Ride) that variability and variants can be used, role cards could be introduced, or variant event cards could be generated for greater options.

I don't dislike this game but I do have a couple of issues with it.  If you're late in the turn order at the beginning,  you can quickly find yourself in a heap of hurt depending on what villages you need to complete.

Regardless I like the variable turn order (El Grande), the hidden 'route' card (Ticket to Ride), the exploration theme (Tikal), and the set collection mechanics (Tikal)...especially when it's wrapped up with nice bits.

Yet another very pretty Kosmos game.  The game works but it just feels like something is missing.  For the family market this game would be a definite hit.  For someone who yearns for something a touch deeper it is another average release.  You really need to come out to a flying start in this game.  The game can  be lost in your initial setup or opening turns.  Again... not great just very average.

Great game that embodies many of my favourite mechanics: I love the simultaneous blind-bid auction that both determines turn-order & revenue, the connection game with preset secret goals a la Ticket to Ride.  What I enjoy the most is that money is tight and as the game continues destination spots start filling up & become more expensive to purchase.  You need to take careful advantage of your position on each turn otherwise you'll be out-manuevered and find yourself short of the cash needed to move forward.  There's a potential runaway leader issue but I feel the game ends before it can become a factor.

I collected this game because at its heart it's economic game with an element of risk management.  The components are very attractive, the rules and game play are simple and short making Amazonas a good choice for teaching a game to players that want to play something new to them, but won't kill an evening's time.  Despite the game's appearance the play is not terribly lively, and the game has a "screw your neighbor" factor that while likely an unintended consequence of a player's move makes me hesitant to add to my list of gateway games for gaming neophytes unless I know them to be keen on economics and risk management.

Fun game from the one time I played it but I can't get over the feeling that the tie resolution system favors specific colors.

An interesting and compelling point-gathering game where players attempt to collect the most rain forest specimens. The rules are smooth and simple, although the gameplay is infinitely more strategic.

Looks fantastic with lush artwork and game board.

Originally purchased this for my mother, to take with her when she went to the Amazon.  She did take it, but ended up not getting a chance to play.  I've "inherited" it.  Very enjoyable on occasional play, better with more players, though it works with two.

RATING: 6
Pleasant enough game. Has a very appealing presentation, and the way you move around the map collecting specimens is neat. The one thing that really sinks this game for me though, strangely enough, is the event deck. At least half of the events that come out every game are bad, and while they affect everybody, it's really difficult to know when exactly they'll show up. You might have played one of your better income cards already, and now you're in a tough spot because an event screwed you over.

Otherwise I think this is a fine family weight Euro. It does feel a little too on-rails for my tastes, between the event deck, the income cards, and your hidden goal card. Still, this isn't bad for something light and breezy. It's just not something I'm interested in exploring further.

An attractive new game from Stefan Dorra.  This is similar in some ways to other connection games like Ticket to Ride, but I like the theme better in this one.  The game is workmanlike and beautifully produced, but it lacks the one really clever new idea that characterizes most of Dorra's designs.  So far I'm enjoying it and am glad to own a copy, but this one isn't top-tier (play and compare to Marracash or Tonga Bonga and you'll see what I mean!)

About the same playing time and level of complexity as in Ticket to Ride. The graphics are fantastic, and I like the theme a lot.

Have only played this game one time so far ... But had a very good time ... Rules are well written and easy to follow. Examples are very helpful in explaining any of our questions that arose. I am not real sure how important the turn order determination is, but when the "Native or wildcard" is up ... it may have more significance. In our game, one player got 2 Native tiles CHEAP, and I thought there was no way to catch up with his lead. This includes the fact that he was the first player to get one of each of the 5 species and get the 5 Victory Points associated with that accomplishment. In the end Malcolm not only caught Dan (each of them has 30 points), but they had to go to the third tie breaker level (money) to decide who won. I am going to leaver this one at an 8 for now, but this may change after a few more plays.

TRY Dec/06.  Nice connection game, with tight money and pretty graphics.  The secret missions are too fixed, or too few in number, and could definitely become predictable.  Same with the location of each species; it'd be nice to be able to mix them up.

Turns are VERY quick, which speeds this game right along.  Definitely not a brain-burner.  Scoring reminiscent of something... I finally figured it out -- it's similar to the monuments in Ra (need at least 1; 3+ get you more points).

I enjoyed Powergrid, but eventually the number crunching got too much for me as did the game length. I think I've found a substitute in Amazonas to fill the void of an connection game driven by money management. So far I like the memorable manifest of the event deck and speculating what may come next and how to manage and increase my finances as a result. Player turns are quick as you are limited to building one or two huts or waiting until further turns. The main niggle with the game is that the board is very busy, so I can't focus on the intent of opponents (like in TransAmerica),so there is no clear sense of competition;another niggle is that allocating turn order cards is a fiddly process, which interrupts game flow; it helps when players can work out and call out clearly their income values. In essence, interesting and novel means of increasing wealth, but not exciting.

A brilliant and wonderful game. It has a lot of fun elements all combined into an original and superb design. Surprisingly deep strategy and some randomness that enhances the game because the events come up in a different order every time, giving good replayability. There is set collection, route connection, blind bidding, and player interaction all combined into an elegant harmony.

The beautiful board with vibrant colors, plus cards and artwork to match, also helps the theme of exploration come alive and makes it a pleasure to play the game. One of the most under rated games on BGG.

RATING: 7
Very good light-middle game with lots of opportunity for clever play. Need proper 'tent' management to have enough gold to handle the late turn setbacks as well as gaining collections of 3 specimens for the VPs. Good crossover game and quite pretty.

Very much parallel solitaire with mostly inadvertent screwage. Because of this, probably best with 4.

Destination cards are unbalanced. 3 cards have only 1 village overlap with another card, 4 cards have 2, and 1 card has 3 (7 are on 2 cards). Clearly the initial placement should be in one those villages. What is most odd is that only 25 of the 30 villages are required destinations, using them could break almost all of the overlaps.

Update: Actually a bit difficult to teach as there are enough concepts that every new player will, at one point or another, forget that every concept was explained, probably more than once.

Also, the money does seem a bit too tight; even 1 more gold would make a difference (remember to pay out for Specimen Tiles even if the player does not play that Specimen Income card when the Specimen is on the Event card).

I think Amazonas needs 4 players to be truly competitive.  Easy to learn rules is a plus, although not a deep game by my standard - and I like a lot of light games!  Very pretty game.

This is a good 1 hour game.  The rounds go fast enough, and there is a lot to plan for. Being mostly about set collection, the game is well balanced and players will often bump into each others planned routes causing a need to scramble for the resources they had planed to get.  There does seem to be a base strategy of planning your resource pick ups around making your bid cards progressively stronger.

It reminds me of The Bridges of Shangri-La, but without the nail-biting tension. Starting position is very important, along with a general plan would be a good idea too. It's all about maximising your income earning and paying low. Not very exciting though - rating may drop with further play. The objective cards don't seem balanced to me. Most sites (all the southern ones), have port access except for one in the centre north and two in the north-east. If one of these sites is your objective site you'll want to start there or near there with your initial placement.

When you play [i]Amazonas[/i] you can't help thinking in [i]Thurn & Taxis[/i], even when there are big differences between them. As in [i]Thurn & Taxis[/i], your goal is to spread all over the map with your houses, or in this case huts, only that this time you won't have to collect sets of cards to do so. Instead you have to play income cards with a sense of strategy and thinking ahead, but also tacticly due to the event cards. Besides, the scoring system is way less complicated and more straight forward. I was really surprised of how well the game works, because when you read the rulebook you think to yourself that the game won't function and that it is broken, but when you play it goes pretty well, feels tense and cuthroat and it looks like there are plenty meaty decisions to be made by the players.  I feel, nevertheless, that the key to win the game is to be the first player to achieve the bonus that is given when you collect all the species, and that the game could be reduced to that race, but I have to play more times to asure that.  Meanwhile, the game has left a good taste in my mouth.

This seems to be a pretty good just-beyond-gateway game. I love the theme, and think it works really well here. Money is tight, and those doggone events can screw up the best-laid plans. I don't really like that there are entire turns where everyone does nothing but gather money, but that's okay. I think if you played this enough, it might be too easy to remember where others want to go on their secret missions. A game I would play again, but don't feel the need to own.

Played my second game of Amazonas at lunch today.  I came in 2nd of 4.  I like this game, it is fairly light, the decisions are not to terribly taxing and it plays quickly once you know what you are doing.  You do have to make some tough choices to make sure you meet all three items that help you to win.  You really need to complete the secret mission, you need to get at least 1 of all 5 items, and you should have 3 tokens in at least three of the items.  Its a lot to manage in 18 rounds.

Money is tight and turn order is key.  Many tension filled moments as you are trying to squeeze you huts into villages before others do.  If you are into tight money management games then this is the one.  The fun squigly movement system leads to a couple unexpected placements.  Takes the only thing that is good about Ticket to Ride (the connection system) and puts a real game on it.  Quick turns  make the end game creep up on you way too quickly.  This is tight till the very end.

RATING: 7
A nice, quick-playing network-building set-collection game. There are only 18 rounds in which to collect VP, and you don't score a large number of VP -- so every one counts. And money is TIGHT, so you need to be as efficient as possible (don't let one player grab all the cheap building sites!). I wonder if it would better to have a little more granularity? Our first play (3er) had us separated by just 1VP each -- was it better play, or simply luck?

--- Summary ---
Players start the game with 2 gold tokens, and a random (secret) goal card showing 4 villages (get -3VP at end of game for each of these without one of your tokens).

Shuffle the 18 event cards; reveal one at the start of each round. 5 provide bonus income to players, 4 may bring a Native token into play, 2 prevents travel by sea and 2 by land, 3 reduces income by half, and 2 rob you of coins. After revealing one, players simultaneously choose one of their unused income cards (1-6, each with the picture of a resource or native, or the 0) and reveal simultaneously. Their income will be the sum of the number on the card and the number of tiles matching the picture on the card (for the 0 card, use the type of tile which you have collected the most).

Players take turns in descending order of income (ties broken by uniquely numbered income cards):
1. collect income, in _silver_ coins (3 silver = 1 gold), resolving event card as appropriate. If event was Native, may skip income step to take a native marker: immediately place it with a previously collected tile (may not move later in game).
2. optionally, place 1+ markers on open building sites connected by forest/sea path to one of your markers (first build may be anywhere); max 1 marker/village/player; collect a tile of the type pictured on the village. Costs 2/3/4 _gold_ (pictured on board). The first time you assemble a set of tiles (1 each type), take the next available Bonus VP chip (5-4-3-2 in 4er game; 4-3-2 in 3er game).

The game ends afte 18 rounds. Score VP:
- 3VP per goal village without your village
+ VP for bonus chip, if any
+ 1VP per tile of a type, _if_ you have 3+ tiles of that type (counting Natives grouped with it earlier)

Most VP wins!

Stuck in the no man's land between a light, family game and a strategic, gamer's game.  It doesn't seem to fit either bill well enough.  Still, it does have some interesting decisions, such as what card to play and when to spend your money, so it's not bad.  It also features nice artwork on the box cover.  I just wish there was a little more depth, especially with the endgame scoring.

Very decent family game, although a tad more complex than most. It doesn't have that instant replayability feeling that really good family games have, but it's always fun to play with people who want to play something different after Settlers or Ticket to Ride.

Not as light as I had been led to believe from comments and reviews here. Wife didn't like it all (too "gamery" for her). I need to try it again without her and also without the crying baby.

I rather enjoy playing Amazonas despite its five hundredth use of the tired premise "everybody has an identical set of cards and chooses the order to play them."  Bonuses for individual animal token holdings at least give different players reasons to play different cards, and apparently I'm a big softie for routes games.

It's pretty and I love the theme (exploring the Amazon) what little there is of it.  Can be subject to a bit of luck resulting from the initial goal card draw.  I like the Niagara-like mechanism with the cards.  Nothing really new here but it's all put together pretty well.

Fun game!  We bought this based only on the cover art and were not disappointed. Mechanically simple but challenging juggling act of how to get money and what types of scoring to go for, and judging where other players are going so you don't get blocked in.

Sadly, for such a beautiful looking game, this game was rather boring without many interesting decisions. Too many rounds were spent passing because of a lack of money. I wanted to like this one so bad, but it only got as high a rating as it did from me because of the beautiful artwork.

Some good things to consider and movements to make. It feels like it ends too soon and you get left a turn or two away from more points, but I guess that's part of the game and something we'll have to learn to plan for.

Recommend playing with Stefan Dorra's bonus points for the leader of each type.

RATING: 5
I could go on about this game.  The worst thing about it is that it isn't the worst thing to play.  It's the logical conclusion in the evolution of Eurogaming.  Throw a bunch of worn to the nub mechanics together in an organized, processional fashion.  Make sure nothing's broken, and voila - game.  Just because it's not all bad, folks might think it's fun.

Devoid of inspiration and ultimately a total snoozer.

Solid family-weight game. Nothing groundbreaking or amazingly exciting here, though. The art is great, however ... a very appealing game visually.

RATING: 6.5
Played once 3-player. Scoring is a little obtuse. Since I remembered the intricacies in the scoring, I inadvertently took advantage and won. The event cards add a bit of randomness, which is always nice to sometimes level the playing field. The board is absolutely gorgeous with bright, vivid colors. The cards fit right in too. Would like to play more. Probably best with 4 players to add more conflict when collecting specimens. Works pretty well with 3 players though.

Amazonas is Ticket to Ride for men, women, and even 2-players.  It's a little more complicated, a little more fun, and much prettier to look at.

RATING: 7

Good "spotting the right place at the right time" game that pleases gamers and non-gamers. Cards are unbalanced:
when you have a draw in points and have to look at the small white number on the card, the player with the BLUE cards has a strong advantage, he always wins with the two highest cards, a 6 and a 5 (experienced gamers will notice this during gameplay). I hope they come up with a fix for this not so insignificant problem...

Weird and abstract.  The whole thing feels very contrived which I guess is what we call a 'pasted on theme'.

RATING: 5.5
Chasing, chasing, the things, everyone will probably get their huts out, the shortage of money hurts everyone, and then there's just a little dance around bonuses on who had a few more coins at some moment, or grabbed an Indian. For all the faffing around, there didn't seem like a lot of game, or a lot of point what came out. Pass.

RATING: 7
We play with Stefan Dorra's original tie-breaking system using colored glass stones on the top right corner of the board.  Keeps play balanced, everyone can play whatever color and order wanted.  Also with scoring variant of 2 points for most in a species, 1 if tied.

(3 plays) Neat little combination of a connection game with a set collection game. I like the fact that a real block is very very hard to accomplish, but it is fairly easy to make things more expensive for your opponents. Of course in a game where money is as tight as Amazonas, that 1 extra gold can make a big difference. I do worry if there is some imbalance between route cards. Some of the cards require some very widely separated routes, while others don't. Also, my group needs to figure out the value of those 2-cost spots and compete for them more; they are geographically imbalanced, but ala Power Grid I think that is self-balancing once the players are aware of its importance. This should have gotten an SdJ recommendation at least, if not a nomination.

A game especially suitable for playing with your family (if they are not really gamers) or people new to gaming (or those not really into it). The rules are simple, the mechanics sound. It's easy to explain, simple to play. The box cover is gorgeous enough to entice many people.

I demoed this game at Origins 05.  It looked interesting, but it was a very fast demo.  It kind of reminds me of the paths from Majharaja (I'm sure there is a better example, since each additional hut costs more) with set collection and different event cards each turn like in Bang High Noon.  Unfortunately, it only supports 4 players, so I definately want to play this before buying.

Really enjoyed my one play (4), and looking forward to another.  A fair amount of luck thrown in, but the planning of connecting your huts and outguessing what your opponent might do make this fun and challenging.  The tightness of money add to the toughness in making the right decisions.

Is there anything wrong with this game?  No, not really.  I mean, I don't like the randomness and uncontrollable nature of the action deck, but as someone else pointed out to me, it's not completely unpredictable.  There's probably some skill in keeping track of which cards have been played out of the deck, knowing how many are left, and juggling your income cards to save the right ones for the right time, but I'd prefer that there be more structure in that deck than I saw in the one game I played.  The rest of it has been done before, in many ways (often better), so this game doesn't have anything to it to make me interested in playing it again.  It's a real shame, too, because I've seen a lot of cleverness in Dorra's other designs, and I was expecting to see some of that here, too.

Played with three and four, and four makes for a tighter game. Light to middleweight connection game, that looks really nice. Might crawl up a bit higher if using the German rules which state Native tiles can only count as a type of specimin you already have, not to get the 5th for the bonus tile.

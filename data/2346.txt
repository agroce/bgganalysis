I enjoy the odd game of this but it isn't as good as Yinsh.  It's just as quick, but it's not as dynamic or as likely to produce a huge, clever swing.  The pieces are great to look at and my eldest son likes to play (though he too prefers Yinsh).

I haven't played any maestros at this yet, but I'm guessing that if I did I'd be soundly thrashed - it's that sort of game.  If you're good at abstracts, you'll be good at this.

From the Reviews: I think this would be a cool game too. These gipf project games seem to have fallen down is some bgg crack and can't get out. Perhaps abstract games just don't get the same attention as euros. I would like to collect these game. They look great

I played it once, and then had to play it again, and again, and again.  It is incredibly intuitive, but plumbing the depths of its strategy is like peering into the black depths of a well.  It if fun to tease out that strategy as the game grudgingly reveals its secrets.  It is just as fun just to have fun with it, trying out different combinations and connections, exploring how different set-ups affect later play and how the diagonals on the board interact.  I will have fun with this for a long time, and will probably never turn down a game.  This has the potential to prove itself a 9 or 10, which is why I give it the .5 after the 8.  I hope it does.

RATING: 10
As a reasonable Othello and Go player, I can see that this game combines the strengths of both games!  Some players who do not know both Othello and Go may not be able to see all the subtlety of the game, but in fact it is there.  The key to the strategy is to deprive your opponent of his mobility, but unlike Othello where you mostly passively run your opponent out of moves while preserving ones for yourself, in Dvonn most moves (in phase 2, at least in the early game) are important aggressively as you can neutralize an opponent's stack with it.  Like Go, the evaluation of relative 'merits' of moves and finding the most valuable one is important, in both phase 1 and phase 2.  For its depth versus its rules simplicity and short playing time, this game is really incredible!

RATING: 8.5
Mm, DVONN. I think it gets scored lower than Yinsh and Tzaar by most people because of the setup phase. Personally, I just do a random setup, then adjust a few pieces to balance the board. Just give each player turns to swap pieces, until both are happy, or have one player rearrange and offer the other player the choice of black or white.

Good game!

I've tried several GIPF games and this is by far the best so far. Has some strategies that a beginner can pick up so the learning curve isn't bad. Lots to think about and many options for moves but not overwhelming. I recommend random set up unless you are really serious and have a lot of experience with the game. Nice to play online at boiteajeux.net.

RATING: 9
I would say that Dvonn is the most accessible of the Gipf series games; the rules are really simple and intuitive, play is fast, and it looks good.  It reminds me of Zertz in some ways, with the reducing options for movement and the isolation of pieces a potentially powerful factor in the game.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Another great fast playing abstract strategy game, with a little depth and a ridiculous name.

I only wish that the board contains more fields, preferably arranged as in [gameid=527] and one or two more red pieces. This would certainly increases playing time and depth, which is somewhat restricted in this game.

As towers increases in height, suddenly they reach a point that they can't move any longer. One more reason a larger board was desired by me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.48
Rating after numerous plays.  Hitting the sweet spot with me this one has just the right mix of speed and depth.  The layout method makes the replayability extremely high. Deceptively simple to learn and teach.  My favorite of the GIPF series.  My only dislike - Like the rest of the series (bar TAMSK) the standard cardboard playing surface, blah!  I'll likely pursue a replacement for my current set in wood.  Likely only the board due to the required height consistency required for the playing pieces.

RATING: 10
In a word, elegant. Just elegant. A simple game with a lot of strategy. One piece takes over another piece, that then makes one new stack. You can only move x spaces. x=the number of pieces in a stack. So a 4 piece stack can only move 4 spaces, no more, no less. There is a lot more to it, but needless to say you can punch out a quick game in under 20 minutes or more, if you like to take your time. 

The object is to be the player with the greatest total combined stack height. Read the forum reviews or Youtube vids to see how the game is played. Well worth it and a lot of fun as well. Worth getting if you like chess, black gammon etc.

[ESP] DVONN se juega en un tablero hexagonal alargado, con 23 fichas blancas, 23 negras y 3 rojas. Al principio el tablero estÃ¡ vacÃ­o. El juego consiste en 2 etapas:
(1) Los jugadores se turnan para ir colocando sus fichas en el tablero, comenzando por las 3 rojas.
(2) Comienzan a apilar fichas encima de otra. Una pieza Ãºnica se puede mover  en lÃ­nea recta 1 espacio, una pila de dos pedazos puede moviÃ³ dos espacios, etc. Una pila debe ser movida siempre en su totalidad y un movimiento debe terminar siempre encima de otro pedazo o pila. Si los pedazos o pilas pierden el contacto con los DVONN-rojos, deben ser quitados del tablero. El juego termina cuando no es posible hacer mÃ¡s movimientos.
Los jugadores ponen las pilas que controlan una encima de otra. Quien posea la pila mÃ¡s alta serÃ¡ el ganador.

I'd liked all GIPF project games so far. DVONN, however, feels a bit too chaotic for me to really enjoy. While most GIPF games take a few plays to wrap your head around them, I've learned you can eventually do so. The options in DVONN, however, are so "deep" (for lack of a better word), that they simply can't be weighted correctly.

Thus, you're usually forced to make a move you simply can't know if it will benefit you or your opponent, in the end. This is specially true at the beginning of the game... when the end approaches, you finally begin to make clever moves, but it might already be too late.

Maybe it's just me, but I simply can't get how to make my initial moves. Which is a bummer, as the game concept is quite neat.

I have only played this on the computer as the game is quite hard to get hold of and face to face opponents for 2 player abstract games are a little thin on the ground but I do love this game.  The computer version gave the option of a randomised piece placement which I think is ideal for starting the game as until you have played the game quite a bit the initial placement of tiles is a slog that lacks the fun of the second half of the game and its not at all apparent where you should play.  Its kind of like the opening moves of chess only far worse.  After a few games though it becomes more fun and rewarding and missing this stage out would lessen the game.

The wipe-out from losing a link to a Dvonn piece can be devastating (agonizing to be a recipient of this). Dvonn is one fantastic game: quick & brutal!

Best of the GIPF-series I've played until today. Not the deepest abstract strategy game there is but deep enough to make it interesting and thus maybe a bit easier for the new gamer.

RATING: 8
I'm generally not pleased with games that make 'setup' a part of the game itself. But for Dvonn it feels close enough to being truly 'part of the game' and not just an exercise in randomizing start position (unlike, for example, Alien City). So with that out of the way, it's a fun game. The rules are fairly simple & intuitive, though I always forget to check if a piece is locked by being surrounded. A good game that I would buy if I had reasonable expectation of regular FTF play.

Just too many option to be viably strategic. To really play it with a plan one would have to do the math, as in "my stack... your stack... my stack.. your stack... unless I start here... my stack... your stack... my stack.. your stack..." ad infinitum. If you don't want to be stuck in analysis paralysis its another game that just plays for the first half, and then you try to save what you can in the second.

Reminds me of Focus, though I seem to play DVONN more quickly.  Each player is afforded a lot of freedom in the choices they make early in the game, and yet it is over fairly quickly.  I keep wanting to play it again, just to try something different from the previous play, and that's a good sign.

Interesting game, more textured than ZERTZ, actually "feels" a bit more like the base game GIPF (although it's much shorter, and like ZERTZ, it accelerates towards inevitable conclusion rapidly since the playing area shrinks with each move). Interesting game, but after about 4 plays doesn't seem to reveal the same depths as GIPF, TAMSK, ZERTZ, or PÃÅNCT; in the other games, each early play would peel away layers of strategy and tactics, while DVONN doesn't seem to be that much more than it is on first inspection. This is not really to take away from DVONN, though, which is quite good for what it is - a short, straightforward but challenging and interesting game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
  Masterfully designed.  I don't play DVONN as much as I want to because most players are intimated by it.  If you are really into gaming, you owe it to yourself to try one of Kris Burm's games.  It seems impossible to contrive a new gaming experience with the same depth as Chess or Go, but he pulls it off time and again.  DVONN is especially interesting for Go players, or (if you are like me), for people who enjoy Tigris & Euphrates.  A great, cutthroat game of acquistion, consolidation and destruction.

RATING: 8
I almost feel like the placement of the reds should be random, because everything builds off of those pieces. You place initially with those in mind, your overall strategy is with those in mind, how dangerous a cut off is based on their location, and a game plays very differently depending on where they are.

Which is, for me, the game's biggest flaw. Those red pieces and having the players determine where to place them. They are either random moves, or too much power in the hands of the better player. The second biggest flaw is the placement of the pieces after as the biggest joy in the game is the fight that happens after.

The central conceit here is nifty, but I feel like this game is shallower than the best of the series. Most of your strategy happens during setup, and the actual game just feels more like straightforward execution. You can react to your opponents a bit here and there, but it does feel like this game just has a rigidity not present in most abstract games.

Update: Before Hey, That's My Fish! existed this filled a nice niche of a quicker, lighter abstract but now I am less certain that this game really has a spot in my collection.

Almost, but not quite enough to get me back into 2 player abstract games. Like the others in the series, it just gives rude people with alot of time on their hands a reason to spend every waking moment they have figuring out optimal play.  Then making others look bad for some strange kind of enjoyment.  The problem with the Gipf series is that it can make losers feel smart.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
On a par with Yinsh. Very interesting decisions to make, and plays very quickly. However, all of the Gipf games seem a little bloodless to me. Kind of like how I feel when I play Go. I would rather play Chess or Backgammon, as they feel more exciting to me. The great tension of a tough position in Chess, or accepting a double in Backgammon are absent. I feel little investment when I win or lose. Still, I would not turn down a game of Yinsh or Dvonn.

RATING: 6.5
I got to play 4 new games from the GIPF-series this month! Previously I had only played Yinsh a couple of times and liked it. As my wife seems to enjoy some abstracts, I figured I might borrow the games and play them with her and see how she felt. She liked most of them so I purchased Dvonn, Tzaar and Yinsh! To both of us, Dvonn is the best game in the GIPF-series though I think it is only marginally better than Tzaar and Yinsh (and all three are better than PÃ¼nct and Zertz).

Itâs hard âreviewingâ a GIPF-game as the rules are so simply yet the gameplay is very deep. This is the case with all of the games in the series! I really love the âin your faceâ aspect of the games as itâs just you versus your opponent. In Dvonn, I like how you can only move a stack exactly the number of pieces it is which can make for some tough choices. I like how you can remove a big chunk of pieces by clever play (by isolating them from a Dvonn piece). And finally I like when either my opponent or I make a sneaky play and steal a huge tower of pieces which tips the balance in one of our directions!

I really love this game and all the games in this series.  They're great 2-player strategy games.  Very easy to learn, but difficult to master.

This one, in particular, is a little like checkers, but with some more complex strategy.

And, once you learn it, it can easily be played in 20 minutes (as the box says), so it's great for an in-between game on board game days or as a quick play when you don't have much time.

It seems fitting to compare DVONN to Focus.  On the positive side, DVONN is much quicker to play and simplier to learn.  However, Focus can be played by 2, 3, or 4 players.  DVONN has a set up phase for the players and has an element where pieces can't move if they aren't next to a free space and die off if they are disconnected from the 3 DVONN pieces.  Focus emphasizes capturing your opponent's pieces, taking a big stack back to an area under your control, and "piling on" to release captured pieces.  Even though both games involve stacking and move pieces equal to the stack's height, Focus is a little more like Chess and DVONN is a little more like GO.  Both games are a blast to play and I gave them both 10's.

Update a few days later:
I'm really not sure I like this game. The central problem seems to be ensuring that the reduction resolves in your favor. Working toward that is a series of brushfires that must be managed sooner or later, but without the ability to really change the focus - only delay it. As with many contemporary abstracts, the focus - particularly as the game progresses - is very heavily on tempo management without the ability to dramatically alter tempo by finding positional weakness. This requires more decision tree analysis than space management. I prefer the latter. Tzaar seems to satify this a bit more. Perhaps it is just that Dvonn has so many micro-fronts that liabilities burble up and shift so quickly and in such quantities. Perhaps it is that I like my liabilities a bit more staticâ¦? Maybe I'm a wargamer at heart.
 
I definitely need to play more to a) understand phase one choices more and b) discover and internalize some of the joseki (am I using this word correctly?).
 
Original: First impression was very good (although not as good as Tzaar). Perhaps a bit rife with tactical puzzles for my taste, I still really enjoyed the interesting problems generated by the movement rules. The fact that the player with the least flexibility at the end will lose because they'll have to make moves against their interest was not something I was able to anticipate. I don't know if this will eventually become something manageable and exciting or will it be such an outsized factor that the early and mid-games are rendered meaningless except inasmuch as you set up the endgame flexibility. Things I (think I) learned in my first play: Dvonn control is critical, dvonn control seems to be a tricky early-game dance that should be more or less resolved by the mid-game, the possible final resting places of dvonn pieces becomes very limited and therefore knowable thus describing the shape of the endgame. I think this game will live or die for me on whether it can be a broader positional battle instead of just a series of tactical puzzles.

I think this is probably my current favorite abstract game.  It's difficult to put my finger on why I like this one more than others in the series (such as Zertz), but there's just something natural in the evolution of the game.  I really like the concept of the height of towers also influencing the move distance.  Lots of really neat mechanics all working in concert.  I'm not a huge fan of abstracts (I'm an RPGer!!!) but this is a keeper.  I'm also interested in learning Go, but I think finding opponents will be very challenging.

Abstract strategy where the goal is to create stacks of pieces that you own by having your piece on top of the stack.  Each stack (a single piece can be considered a stack of one) is allowed to move in a straight line and must move the number of spaces as the count of pieces in the stack.  Creating a tall stack may be counterproductive since it may reduce the stack's ability to move.  Stacks must end movement on an occupied space and/or adjacent to a stack containing one of the red "dvonn" pieces.  Otherwise, those stacks are out of the game.  The winner is the player with the most number of pieces in their stack.

It's a good amount of challenge in a relatively short play time.

This is a neat 2-player game. For me it's really tough to plan for the critical endgame, but I still enjoy the game.

DVONN is the second Project GIPF game I purchased, after YINSH. At first I scoffed a bit at it for its simpler gameplay when compared to YINSH, but over time I found my appreciation of this stacking game growing. YINSH can become a really heavy-duty abstract at times, while DVONN keeps on purring ahead all the same. People not familiar with abstracts usually like this aspect better, and I find DVONN's style of play suits my mood more often. But at the same time the lack of a genuine [i]challenge[/i] means that after having played it, I don't immediately need to put it out again the next day. Another minor quibble I have with DVONN is the fact that at some point you must be very careful in how you make your final moves. The odd thing is that in the beginning it doesn't really matter all that much, resulting in a bit of a strange way of playing the game. But it remains a good all-purpose abstract all the same.

As engaging as the other GIPF games I've played. The capture mechanics are going to be hard to master I think, and the need to huddle around the red pieces is an interesting twist.

That would be easily solved by making my own board, however.

Components: Attractive and well-made game. The pieces are a pleasure to handle and stack, and stacked columns are very sturdy.

Experience: Easy to learn. I use a random setup. The opening moves often feel a bit arbitrary, but as the game progresses and the possible choices diminish, the strategy and tension ratchets up a few notches. Lots of opportunity for clever play, for protecting my important stacks, and for threatening my opponent's stacks.

Like in TZAAR, being aggressive isn't necessarily a good thing: later in the game, I might have used up my easy moves and be forced to make a move I don't want to.

GIPF series rank: 1 of 7 (three-way tie with YINSH and TZAAR).

RATING: 7
The GIPF games get their charm from the fact that each game has two gimmicks that work together to create interesting emergent dynamics.  In this game, you have on the one hand pieces that move further and further as the board shrinks in size, and on the other the pepperonis of power, contiguety with which keeps peices in the game.  Controlling access to the pepperonis makes for interesting tactical and strategic decisions unavailable in similar board-shrinking games.

Kris Burm Ã  dÃ©veloppÃ© un concept novateur quâil a appelÃ© le GIPF project. Câest un ensemble de six jeux qui peuvent se jouer Ã  la fois indÃ©pendamment ou combinÃ©s autour de Gipf le jeu central.
Dvonn est le quatriÃ¨me jeu de la sÃ©rie, il se dÃ©marque des trois premiers, car pour la premiÃ¨re fois le plan de jeu nâest plus un hexagone rÃ©gulier mais un hexagone Ã©tirÃ© qui compte 49 emplacements. Il y a 23 pions blancs, 23 pions noirs et 3 pions rouges appelÃ©s Dvonn.

PrÃ©paration
Alternativement les deux joueurs placent dâabord les trois Dvonn puis les pions de leur couleur sur les emplacements libres du plateau. Le plateau se remplit peu Ã  peu et fournit une configuration de dÃ©part diffÃ©rente Ã  chaque partie.

But du jeu : avoir une pile plus haute que son adversaire ( vous allez comprendre bientÃ´t)
A son tour de jeu un joueur doit effectuer un dÃ©placement tant que câest possible. Les dÃ©placement obÃ©issent Ã  certaines conditions :

1- Le joueur ne peut dÃ©placer que ses pions et les piles de pions qui lui appartiennent. Câest la couleur du pion supÃ©rieur de la pile qui indique son possesseur.

2- Il est impossible de dÃ©placer un pion ou une pile de pion qui soit complÃ¨tement entourÃ© par des pions ou des piles. En dÃ©but de partie il est nÃ©cessaire de dÃ©placer un pion en pÃ©riphÃ©rie.

3- Une pile se dÃ©place en ligne droite dâun nombre dâemplacements Ã©gal au nombre dâÃ©lÃ©ment qui la compose. Une pile de un pion se dÃ©place dâun emplacement, une pile de 5 pions se dÃ©place de 5 emplacements.

4- Lâemplacement dâarrivÃ©e doit Ãªtre occupÃ©.

Maintenant le petit plus signÃ© Kris Burm qui transforme un bon jeu en un jeu excellent : les pions doivent Ãªtre connectÃ©s en permanence Ã  un pion Dvonn, si un pion ou une pile est isolÃ©e ils sont retirÃ©s du jeu ! Un pion est connectÃ© avec un Dvonn quand il est possible de les relier par un chemin non interrompu composÃ© de pions (et/ou de piles de pion). Une pile qui contient un pion Dvonn ne peut pas Ãªtre Ã©liminÃ©e, elle est en contact direct avec un Dvonn.

Nous avons ainsi une diminution progressive du terrain ( voir la condition NÂ°4) si bien que le nombre de coups possibles diminue. Les joueurs doivent jouer tant que c'est possible et Il peut arriver qu'un joueur joue plusieurs fois de suite en fin de partie avant que son adversaire puisse jouer car ses pions sont entourÃ©s. Quand plus aucun mouvement n'est possible la partie sâachÃ¨ve et les scores sont comparÃ©s en empilant toutes les piles de sa couleur qui restent sur le terrain. La plus haute pile indique le vainqueur.

Mon opinion
Encore une superbe rÃ©ussite de Kris Burm ! Un mÃ©canique astucieuse pour un jeu riche et accessible. Ici trois tendances sâamplifient avec la partie, la rÃ©duction du terrain, lâimmobilisme des grandes piles au fur et Ã  mesure quâelles sâÃ©lÃ¨vent, la difficultÃ© de rester connectÃ© Ã  un Dvonn alors quâil y rÃ©duction du terrain. Au dÃ©but la tendance naturelle est de se constituer des grandes piles mais trÃ¨s vite le jeu apparaÃ®t extrÃªmement versatile, une pile peut Ãªtre Ã  la merci dâun simple pion et passe Ã  lâadversaire avec une facilitÃ© enrageante. A Dvonn rien nâest perdu dâavance et il est courrant que la situation se retourne complÃ¨tement Ã  la fin. La partie peut mÃªme se perdre sur le dernier coup que vous avez jouÃ© car vous Ãªtes forcÃ© de jouer tant que câest possible. Dâailleurs, plus la partie avance plus il faut cogiter.
Aucune partie ne ressemble Ã  une autre ce qui tÃ©moigne de la richesse et de la durÃ©e de vie du jeu. Câest pour moi un coup de cÅur qui cadre parfaitement avec mes critÃ¨res: plaisir et renouvellement.
P.S : La mise en place du jeu peut vous paraÃ®tre dÃ©routante, je pense quâelle conditionne en rien la victoire, câest juste une maniÃ¨re dâassurer une rÃ©partition Ã  peu prÃ©s homogÃ¨ne des pions.

A very deep abstract. Simple rules, engaging play, as is the trademark of all the GIPF games.  For an average player like me, it is sometimes very hard to find the optimal moves, especially at the beginning of a game.

Like 'Hey That's My Fish' on steroids.

Nice abstract two player game that plays quickly but provokes thought. I'm still trying to work-out if there are any meaningful tactics you can apply during the initial placement stage: occupying edge spaces feels like the correct strategy but can get turned against you. Love the chunky playing pieces - the board could do with a little more oomph in terms of colour/contrast and textured indents to hold the pieces would have been a nice touch.

DVONN forces players to make some very difficult decisions with lots of pieces (hopefully) momentarily sacrificed until the very end.  The pressure increases each turn with the game swinging back and forth between players as pieces are rendered immobile or knocked out of the game.  The rules are ridiculously simple for such a deep game.

Amazing two player abstract game.  The board is seeded with 23 playing pieces of each player, and 3 DVONN pieces, which are like supply sources in a wargame (if you lose contact, you remove isolated pieces).  Players take turns to "stack" and capture pieces, but pieces must move their height to capture.  Fascinating, but easy to grasp game.  By far my favorite of the GIPF series.

In keeping with the essence of simplicity like the other GIPF games, DVONN is learned and played in minutes.  The strategies reveal themselves with every move; incredible depth for such a small footprint in rules.  I absolutely adore the tactile feel of this game.

[Abstract] {2P:6} (Played on BSW) 2P abstract game of one-upmanship. Players stack colored rings one on top of each other. Only the player with the topmost ring can move a stack, and only then if the stack is not surrounded and only a number of spaces equal to its height. Stacks with no contact with one of three red "rings of life" are removed from play. Player with most rings in stacks they control (their rings is on top) wins. Nice 2P new age abstract with medium-range planning possibilities. I can "see" DVONN easier than I can "see" YINSH, but somehow I enjoy playing (and losing at) YINSH just a bit more. They're both good though, and I like them better than their older sibling GIPF. My ranking of the series: TAMSK (9) YINSH (8), PUNCT (7), DVONN (6), GIPF (5), ZERTZ (4).

Dvonn is a very strategic two-player game.  Its rules are simple: first players put their pieces on the board, second each player takes a turn moving a stack of chip (with his/her color on top) a number of spaces equal to the number of chips.  When no moves are possible, the player who controls the most hips wins.  The bits are amazing, gameplay is quite good -- my only complant is how easy it seems for the game to get away from you.  When one player starts to pull ahead, it can get real frustrating.

DVONN is another quality entry in the GIPF series that involves building stacks that will ultimately tower over your opponent.  The rules are super simple and the brain burn isn't too bad.

This is a brain-burner because you have to take a lot of potential moves into account. As the game approaches the end there's a sweet spot where only a few moves are possible but some of them can be real killers.

I used to think this game was more tactical than strategic, until I played some people who really understood it and I got completely and obviously thrashed. I suspect it will take me many many plays to really get it.

Dvonn er min personlige favorit blandt Gipf-spillene, hvilket vil sige ikke sÃ¥ lidt, da i hvert tilfÃ¦lde tre af spillene i serien er blandt mine top 10 spil indenfor abstrakte to spillers spil. DesvÃ¦rre har mit indtryk vÃ¦ret, at min kÃ¦rlighed til Dvonn ikke deles med nÃ¦r sÃ¥ mange som til spil som Yinsh og Zertz. Reglerne til Dvonn kan nÃ¦sten ikke tÃ¦nkes simplere. Den konstante trussel om at kunne fÃ¥ isoleret sine brikker fra de rÃ¸de brikker med tabet af dem til fÃ¸lge og det faktum at antallet af trÃ¦k er stÃ¦rkt begrÃ¦nset gÃ¸r pÃ¥ den ene side spillet utrolig let tilgÃ¦ngeligt og pÃ¥ den anden side totalt utilgiveligt overfor fejl.

Great game.  I slightly prefer Zertz and Yinsh, but it's of the same caliber, and better than Gipf.  The placement phase is still a bit haphazard to me, beyond just focusing placing on the edges and near the reds.  Once the movement phase begins, though, I find it a delightful brain-warmer.

RATING: 6
A solid game in the GIPF family.  GIPF games to me are abstract games for those that don't like abstract games.  This one is a little less dynamic than Yinsh is for me.  Just the same, the bits are great and the game is interesting to play.  I stink at this game.

Beautiful components, great game.

Although the stacking is Focus-like, the persistant stacks, and piece-to-piece only moves make for a much different experience.

I found a computer version with an AI that consistantly stomps me without mercy, so I still have a lot to explore with this one.

RATING: 8
Uh oh...new Hive rival!? So satisfying to stack the pieces and to blow up huge sections of the board. Like most 2p abstracts, I think the most important thing is a similar preference among the players in skill and the amount of time that's appropriate to take on a turn. I've only played under those conditions and this game nails it. An 8 for now but it might go back down to Hive's level after the new wears off. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
For me, DVONN is too focused on brute-force lookahead (versus intuition), and feels more like work than play. I have no idea what I'm doing during the setup phase! Probably an excellent game for the right player, but not my kind of game.

YINSH > TAMSK > PÃNCT > DVONN > ZERTZ

Great great game, totally blew my mind the first time I tried at boardspace.net. Everything you can expect from an abstract is here:

- Limited playing time (due to the shrinking board and stacking);
- Deep enough to be enjoyed by veterans. The first step of the game must take forever to completely master;
- Gives a sense of accomplishment to beginners;
- Clever mechanics and twists (DVONN pieces, number of spaces for movement according to stack height).

The only thing that can throw some people off is the learning process, which seems to be backwards in this one: beginners will only be able to see all the possibilities towards the end of the game, and this ability will gradually expand backwards. I really enjoy this feature, but some people might be too lost because of it.

More than sixty plays online (1704 rating on Little Golem, which put me at #40 the last time I looked). Superb two-player game with a great balance between analysis and intuition. It's short and accessible, and yet there are many depths and levels to plumb. Mobility, positioning, pocketing, isolating...so much to delve into. I'd recommend this one very highly to just about anyone. Incidentally, don't judge the game after only playing it online with the random setup; setting your pieces up yourself IS part of the game and is necessary to understanding the strategy.

RATING: 8
I enjoy DVONN a lot, but then I like 2-player abstracts.  The game has what is (to me) a unique mechanic where every move you make actually limits your ability to move in the future.  I like counter-balancing capturing pieces with the need for board mobility.

Played 5+ A pleasant abstract game with a Zen quality. *UPDATE* I lost one of the pieces and eventually tossed the game out. I guess it can't be that great or I would be inclined to order it again. My main problem was finding someone to play with. Players need to be reasonably matched to get a satisfactory game though the ability match is not as critically balanced as chess. Feb 04

Scared to rate abstracts too confidently, because what do I know. But this seems to be made up of multiple spiky elements-- not quite rules exceptions, but still things without which the game would be more elegant, and yet if you take them all away maybe there's no game?

I'm guessing this was an influence on Quantum Leap, which I took to a little more readily, but I still liked this.

For all that this is a brain-burner, it still feels friendly to me.  I enjoy the network aspects of the game, by which I mean that every piece really does affect every other piece.  As the board shrinks and legal moves become fewer, then the tension *really* starts to rise....  A modern classic.

It's getting difficult to pin down a favorite in the Gipf series, but Dvonn is worth considering as the best. Stack discs for control. If you're color is on top, you control the entire stack. On top of that all stacks must be networked to one of the three red "Dvonn" pieces. The game wants your to control as many picees of possible, while segmenting the board. Isolated pieces are removed. The strategy takes a match or two to click, but of the entire series, we played this the most back-to-back. A winner, for sure.

First play, against myself.  I really kicked my own ass!  Certain moves become very apparently good and bad after just one play, so it will be interesting to see how a game might progress with more knowledge of how the game plays out.  There's a very nice dynamic between the large immobile monoliths that are worth more points, but can often be severed from the Dvonn pieces.  Now I just need to get the SO to play with me.

The SO has no interest in playing this one, but I've got it to the table a few times while waiting for more players to arrive for game night.  I really like this game and now I'm hoping to thrift more from this series!

Simple rules, incredibly challenging gameplay. High "revanche" factor due to short matches.
Warning: Definitely not a game to play while drunk :)
Takes some rounds to get the basic stategic concepts. Feels somewhat randm when playing another beginner while learning the game. Recommendation: Find a skilled player (www.brettspielwelt.de is full of them) and play some rounds. You have no chance, but playing (and loosing) against a focused strategy is very educational. The process of learning what makes the game tick and how to use that against your opponent feels great.

These GIPF project games must be a great boon to people who love abstract 2-player games because they honestly are quite good. I just don't have a lot of interest in abstracts in general, or in 2-player games. They just require a lot of plays to get good at, and getting good makes the game LESS fun, unless the same two people are both improving. Even so, this game has some things going on that I have not seen before, and I'd be more than happy to play again.

Not really a fan of shrinking playing area...  Kind of a combo of checkers and [thing=528][/thing], except the stacks must move as many spaces are there are tokens in it.  Token on top of the stack denotes the owning player.  Player with the most tokens at the end of the game (when no more moves are possible) wins.

Prefer [thing=7854][/thing] in this series.

RATING: 8
Dvonn is another great always shrinking playing area member of the Gipf family! The DVONN work in really interesting ways in that not only is the board always shrinking, but it is also shrinking in ways in which to be cut off from the 'center' (i.e., connected to a DVONN disk) means removal from the board as well. I still am not able to articulate the abstracted patterns perceived, but yet another brilliant game from Chris Burm. Initial rating: 8.

RATING: 8
Very nice two player abstract! Can be played lightly or seriously. I love that great swaths of play area can be swept away, I can think of no other abstract where big exciting events like that are the norm. It makes those plays seem momentous.

Tricky, tricky. This is a little more closely related to Zertz than it is to Yinsh or Gipf insofar as the pieces on the board don't *really* belong to you, even if you think that they do.  As the stacks become larger, it becomes more difficult to predict what they will do, even though the number of options on the board decreases.  As a result, I didn't feel like I had much control, but if I played enough to deeply understand the game, maybe I would.

Take this rating with a grain of salt as I am not a devoted abstract fan.  Instead, I either love them or hate them depending on their mechanism.  I did not particularly care for the mechanism in this one.  Personally I think the game would be much better played on a far larger board to allow taller stacks to move radically. This game has beautiful pieces.

This game clearly stole concepts from Sid Sackson's Focus but it is not nearly as good as that game.

RATING: 9.5
Even if you don't like abstracts you owe it to yourself as a Gamer to try this and Yinsh at the least, for sure these Gipf series games have converted many non-abstract players into believers. 

I got my ass handed to me in my first game and I do play abstracts, this is a very good sign. Very elegant with simple rules (the restrictions did take some getting use to as I always wanted to move a piece I couldn't) yet the ramifications of a simple move are not easily apparent (especially the first half of the game) showing there is some nice depth to explore.

So easy to learn and teach and plays in 10 to 20 minutes so great for a gateway tool, bring it to work and kick some non-gamer butt at lunch-time! 

[u]UPDATE:[/u] 7.5 => 8.5 WOW!!! Fantastic game as I suspected, so simple to learn and challenging to play, almost a chess replacement for me as it has nice depth and plays in 20 minutes flat or less which is so great and really appealing to not only me but a larger audience of opponents as well.

Very important to play both offensively and defensively here and being subtle can help, planning is very much required and rewarded. My Mother and Father are not gamers but will play some games when I bring them over, they bought my copy of this from me when I went over last time which speaks volumes. 

This could surpass Yinsh for me....AWESOME and highly recommended

[u]UPDATE:[/u] 8.5 => 9 Simply awesome and pushing the envelope for a 10. Depth to time ratio can't be beat here and the game is just brilliant from how the stack movement is dictated/restricted by height and how everything must stay connected to the 3 red rings which really makes for a dynamic (sometimes half the board can be wiped out)and strategic game. Although not a Chess or Go replacment this will see the table far more as it plays in 20 minutes tops! 

[u]UPDATE:[/u] 9 => 9.5 Oh damn I love this game!

Another Gipf Project game. Easily the best aside from Gipf. Dvonn is interesting in that the moves in the game are finite. The board has less moves each time you make one. The tables can turn at any time and pieces may be taken from the board when you're not paying attention. Very satisfying game.

--- Original comments after ~6 plays ---
My Secret Santa in 2007 sent this to me.  It's my first GIPF game.

This is a fun abstract.  I enjoy Go and chess, but my wife won't touch them.  She reluctantly tried the first DVONN game with me, and then immediately wanted to play a second.  

I'm sure that I'm super low on the learning curve, but I'm finding great enjoyment in cutting off sections of the board and watching my opponent's pieces disintegrate.  

It's fast and it's fun.  I'll be looking at other GIPF games now.


--- Update (16 plays) ---
I've bumped up my rating a bit.  I would rather play this than chess, and I don't see that changing. Over my lifetime, Go will probably win out over this one, but the novelty of DVONN is still strong and we're discovering new things every play.

Simple to teach and funner to lose to. I compare it to Zertz where if one player has a lot more experience, the other player doesn't even get to make decisions. The stronger player will still win in Dvonn but at least the winner doesn't dictate the moves of the weaker player.

(A somewhat shallow comment but I was mildly disappointed the board is flat card... the finest BGG photo is nicely lit to aid the impression of an engraved board, but the "engraving" is merely printed on.)

The oh so simple mechanic of the value of the stack restricting its mobility is sweeeeet.

I've played this several times, and I really enjoy it.  I need to learn some strategy in so far as initial ring placement goes---seems like random and trying a tact both yeilded the same result, but I'm sure it has more to do with me not being good, then the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Short, sweet, and brutal. It's devastating (but thrilling) when you lose half your pieces in one move because your opponent found a way to isolate them. As the pieces cluster and become higher (and therefore less mobile), and the board shrinks, there is a sort of pervading pessimism to this game. As Lawnjob puts it, "It's like the game itself is dying as you play it." Lots of people knock the first stage, but the strategy for that comes with practice, and you could also set it up randomly if you must.

DVONN is collectively our household favorite of the GIPF Project games to date.  There's a certain finesse required in the placement of your pieces during the 'set-up' phase, so don't take it too lightly.  The shrinking play area is reminiscent of ZERTZ that lends a tactical feel to the game.  What could be easier than to simply compare the height of your stacks at the end of the game to determine the winner?

I know that this one is highly regarded in the GIPF series but I find that it is the one that really demands players of equal skill. The board setup phase, which is interesting, requires you to have a game plan going in. I rate both ZERTZ and YINSH ahead of this.

It's a nice abstract that starts off feeling pretty loosey-goosey, but gets tougher and more precise as the board shrinks and choices become more significant. You start off taking turns placing your pieces on the board until every space has a piece on it. In addition to black and white pieces, there are neutral red pieces that play a key role in the game. Once all pieces are placed, you take turns jumping on top of other pieces forming stacks which then belong to the player on top. Stacks move the exact distance of the pieces that comprise them, so every time a stack grows it moves differently. You can only move pieces on top of other pieces, so every time a space is vacated, that space is essentially out of the game, and so the payable area shrinks as you go. All pieces must be connected through some unbroken path to a red piece. If a group of pieces gets disconnected from a red piece, they are removed from play. In this way, large sections of the board can suddenly be wiped clean. I kind of wish the game started tighter. I'm sure initial placement plays some factor in strategy, but I find it difficult to form a solid plan until about a third of the way in. Gaining control of the red pieces is key, as well as positioning yourself to be the only player with legal moves at the game's end. Good one if you are in the mood for a lighter abstract.

7 is my default GIPF series rating after only a couple plays.  I can appreciate the design and enjoy playing, but I have yet to truly understand the game.  I feel like my enjoyment increases the more I play any of the GIPF series.

Update: Having played more, I enjoy and appreciate the game more.  The only thing I don't like about DVONN is the setup, not that it's hard, but as a beginner it feels arbitrary, though I know it shouldn't be.  I have no idea where it's best to start my pieces.  I much prefer starting with a clean slate like in the other games in the series.  Up to an 8.

Es un juego dividido en dos fases. Una primera fase en la que los jugadores, se van alternando para colocar una ficha. La primera fase termina cuando todas las posiciones del tablero estÃ¡n ocupadas. En la segunda fase los jugadores se van alternando para mover una Ãºnica pila bajo su control. 

Los finales de cada partida suelen ser realmente emocionantes.

It cannot be denied that the Gipf games - with the possible exception of PÃ¼nct - make things keep happening: in this case the shrinking play area and the growing stacks that can change owners at the drop of a pineapple ring. One may suspect this theme of reversals (masterfully planned or otherwise) has contributed to the game's popular appeal, but it's not my favourite in the series. Took me only a couple of games to beat Dumbot.

RATING: 7
2015-07-01 - 7.5 - My initial rating is after two games. DVONN is less straightforward than YINSH and offers quite different range of choices, which I did not see in other games. The mechanism of stacks which must move as far as they are high is rather unique, very interesting and forces to plan your moves differently that you could expect.

2015-07-04 - 7.5->8 - Very good, tricky abstract game, which can really surprise you by what you will able to do in a game with so few rules.

2015-07-13 - 8->7 - After more plays I lower my rating. Maybe it is more diffcult game to jump into right away. I think I don't use its full potential, but for now it's not as entertaining as Yinsh. Nevertheless it's a good game and I think I'll keep it as I will try to get more GIPF games.

2015-10-19 - The biggest problem with this game for me is this first phase when you should put all the disks on the board  one by one. Probably you can even win the game during that phase, but I just don't like it so we put disks random, but you might make better position for one player that way.

Excellent 2 player game and for me my second favourite of the Gipf series (Tamsk being my first). I must admit I tend to prefer themed games, but Dvonn stands out from the abstracts in that play is fast and snappy. The number of options available each turn is limited but not restrictive and therefore the game does not stagnate as "limitless options" are reviewed by your opponent each turn. This has to be one of my top three abstract strategy games. Well done Kris.

DVONN is played on an elongated hexagonal board, with 23 white, 23 black and 3 red DVONN-pieces. In the beginning the board is empty. The players place the pieces on empty spaces of the board, without restrictions. They place the DVONN-pieces first and their own pieces next. Then they start stacking pieces on top of each other. A single piece may be moved 1 space in any direction, a stack of two pieces may be moved two spaces, etc. A stack must always be moved as a whole and a move must always end on top of another piece or stack. If pieces or stacks lose contact with the DVONN-pieces, they must be removed from the board. The game ends when no more moves can be made. The players put the stacks they control on top of each other and the one with the highest stack is the winner.

RATING: 6
Solid abstract which contorts your brain a bit as you have to be careful in stacking pieces as your movement with that stack increases by one.  Empty spaces can be traveled over but NOT landed upon meaning stacks can get stuck easily or set up to be taken over.  To add to the puzzle, any stack not linked to one of the three red dvonn pieces are removed from the game.  If you get a red dvonn piece in as part of a stack, that yet throws another wrench into the works as it can move around and more easily unlink pieces.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Fun abstract.  I felt like the game was less predicated on memorized strategies, like GIPF seemed to have, because of the wild variety of possibilities of location of the stacks, where they could move, and their relation to other stacks.

I think this is my second-favorite abstract I've ever played, after Go.  Dvonn has some spiritual kinship to Go -- the gradual placement, life and death, attack and defense all feel similar, although the two games play out wholly differently.

Dvonn is a beautiful game, one that feels like it's been around for a couple millenia.  Well done, Mr. Burm (with an assist by Sid Sackson, the great innovator, who came up with the "height of stack = movement" concept for his game "Focus", which I haven't played yet.)

This game is brutal.  You're desperately trying to look ahead and parse all possible moves, but then you're opponent does something else and the board shifts dramatically.  By cutting off rings from the red ones you can cause some huge shifts in the board.

I love how the board gets smaller and tighter with every move.  It's like the game itself is dying as you play it.

There's nothing I don't like about this game, but I'll hold off on giving it a 10 yet because I don't know if it has the same kind of depth and replayability as my other 10s.  Even if it doesn't, you have to consider how much you're getting for a 20 minute time investment per game.

I like the "acceleration" feeling, towards the end: high stacks start to be unmanoeuverableâ¦

What I don't care for:
- You can easily lose a big stack, which results in a large swing in points.  This I don't like too much, because (after 2 games), I can't really plan and try to save the stack.  Being able or not to do this seems to depend a lot on the initial placement, where players can't make plans that far ahead.  This is in contrast with two games that I prefer to Dvonn: Yinsh (which brings a lot of freedom), and Tzaar (more freedom than Dvonn).

Played two games on BSW.  I'm not ready to give up on this game just yet, but the strategy is a little hard to grasp without some help.  I'm going to check the strategy tips on the Gipf website and Joe Gola's in depth session report on this gamepage, and see if it clicks any more for me.

Right now, though, I greatly prefer Yinsh, Go or Chess for a two player abstract.

RATING: 8
This is right up there with Yinsh for me.  I think it is a bit more chaotic, because of the initial placement mechanic.  Maybe it's me, but I really have very little strategy during the opening phase where you are just covering up the board with pieces.  But like all the gipf series, the mechanics are so easy, any age can play.  But like all the series, it rewards repeated play as figure out how the meat of the game really works.

ZunÃ¤chst werden von den Spielern abwechselnd insgesamt drei Dvonn-Steine auf das Spielbrett gesetzt. Danach legt jeder Spieler abwechselnd 23 "normale" Steine auf das Brett. Steine, die im Laufe der Partie keine Verbindung zu den Dvonn-Steinen mehr haben, werden aus dem Spiel genommen und sind verloren.
Der Zugmechanismus hat es in sich. Zwar ist das Prinzip ganz einfach, doch die Folgen und taktischen MÃ¶glichkeiten sind so enorm, dass Dvonn damit zu einem echten Denk-Spiel wird.

SEPT. 2005: i've played 2-3 times....interesting, probably less than Yinsh at the moment. I think that it is very chaotic, at least at the begining...
oct. 3: after 5 more plays...fantastic. Very tactic..you can absolutely think about 3 or 4 moves in advance (ore tha Yinsh, for example). 
And the first pieces, in the setup, are fundamental (very different that i thought at my firs plays). Wonderful.
The first 5 moves for every player takes probably 40 minutes...But anuyway, that is the way to enjoy this game. In 15 minutes you play almost mechanically...Don't do it....think in every move...

RATING: 8
This is the GIPF series game I find the most enjoyable. Does that mean it's the lightest? Probably not. I think it does reflect that this is a game that can be played almost casually, without much lookahead. And while you won't likely win with that strategy, that doesn't become apparent until the final scoring, and even then it won't be a blowout. So the casual player doesn't feel like cattle led to the slaughter, as can happen in many abstracts.

I'm so bad at this game but I still enjoy playing it. All I'll say about it is that, while it's being played, the game is very attractive. That combined with the simple and intuitive rules makes this an easy and fun game to introduce to people. ***UPDATE*** Lowered my rating a point. I still quite like the game but I've not had much luck in introducing it to other people. The game just doesn't have a 'spark' that excites people. ***UPDATE AGAIN*** and I've raised my rating considerably after many more plays. Getting a handle on some strategy really helps appreciate this game. It's my favorite of the GIPF project.

Real hardcore abstract. I am still exploring it. It feels difficult to plan ahead sometimes, but I need more plays to get the right feeling. For the moment is just an 8, for the simplicity of the rules, for the excellent build quality, and for the sensible balance of power the player should keep with (go too strong and you will be eliminated, stay too thin and you will be assimilated).

Though the initial placement of discs seems to be somewhat random because there are just oo many choices, the game play is excellent.

The wife and I have played a few games of this now and we both like it.  I had played a couple of games of it at a local game day event and I liked it.  It is a good addition to my collection.
My kids are getting old enough to appreciate this game.  It is very abstract which takes some of the fun out of it for me (I like theme in my games) but I will play it if asked.

Abstracts don't have theme? I feel like I'm targeting long-distance objects with my rifle or bow. You have to set things up to allow the taller stacks to land somewhere. Mid-game to endgame is super fun!

Also known as "Steve wins". Find Alan Kwan's glossary on-line; his terminology is very helpful in understanding the nature of the forces at work here.


...wow, I haven't touched that comment in 3000 years. I played a bunch of Dvonn before I joined the geek, when I had far fewer games. It doesn't get out much any more, but I'm going to try to play it more on boardspace.net. It remains my second-favorite of the Gipf series, behind [gameid=528], which I rate a 10. Or maybe [gameid=31999] is second. While the placement phase is confusing and hard to evaluate, it clearly is significant. But as the game progresses and stacks develop, I find the fact that you are building something (albeit something that can be stolen from you) makes intermediate goals very clear. Deciding which intermediate goal to pursue (gain control of a stack with a red piece, separate or immobilize an opponent's stack...) is however difficult.

I've played quite a few stacking games since Dvonn, but Dvonn stands head and shoulders above all of them. It has a decisiveness that [gameid=789] lacks, superior clarity (towards the end anyway, once I've made a fatal mistake) and obvious depth.

RATING: 7.5
Love the elegance of the game mechanism.The game can sometimes loose its tension before the end of the game because you sort of know who is going to win. I admire how the initial placement of the DVONN pieces makes each game a new experience.

After 15 plays I started to get it, now a 100% success rate against newbies. DVONN is all about timing, what has to be done first and what can wait or has to wait. After some plays you get a feeling for that.

Near 20 plays: WOW! this game is awesome! Simple rules but so many factors to consider.

Some tips: First of all single pieces and low stacks are the most useful units during a game, taking over high stacks for the points and victory is not that hard and can wait and has to wait till the last moves before the end of a game. Furthermore never jump on your own pieces unless you have very good reasons to do so. Never start local battles you cant win, first prepare a battle. Never continue to move in a region when you already secured that region for you, just wait till the end of the game for that. Try to jump with stacks on the single pieces of your opponent and try to avoid that your opponent will do that to you. Make use of the shrinking board. And last but not least: pay extra attention to regions without DVONN pieces nearby, especially when your opponent is (almost) not present there.

After ~150 games, most of them at Little Golem, I'm done with this game. The setup phase still feels random, and I don't like the way you have to calculate moves in advance - that's not something I really enjoy.

But don't mind me - Dvonn is a fine game, just not for me.

Indifferent.

RATING: 9
A modern classic--one of my favorites in the fantastic Gipf series of abstract games. Plays quickly (setup is actually the first phase of play); love the playing pieces and the unusual oblong board. The possibility of severing pieces from their necessary connection to a "Dvonn" (one of the three red pieces) adds a lot of pleasing drama and tension to the game. I've seen half the board emptied in a flash! [30 plays]

[article=10482014]Rich Gowell made a great comment[/article] about how DVONN and games like it have tried to carve out a "third class" of abstract games, between the simple, ubiquitous games like Checkers, Mancala, etc. and the deep, lifestyle games of Go and Chess. I couldn't agree more. The outstanding question is what role this third class has to play.

For me, DVONN succeeds as a "step-up" alternative to entry-level abstracts or as a meaty filler for two. Come to my house and want to play Checkers? How about DVONN instead? At a game night and got twenty minutes to kill with a thinky game? DVONN's a great choice.

But as a go-to game, something I'll make time to play, DVONN falls short of the older, deeper alternatives like Chess. Chess offers more strategic options, a worldwide community of players, and more layers of depth. Games can be cranked out just as quickly and feel like an investment in a lifelong skill. DVONN and other games in this "third class" feel more like advanced pastimes. No, I can't beat the Holtz engine at DVONN, but the same can be said of my current level of AI difficulty in Chess. Plus, since DVONN etc. are more accessible, I sort of don't [i]want[/i] to get good at them. Crushing the Checkers player at DVONN will just lead to more Checkers.

For others, this "third class" might cut the other direction, serving as quicker, more satisfying replacements for the "elite" class of abstracts. But for me, DVONN takes on a strange role as a game I'm almost always willing to play but will myself suggest only in the rarest of circumstances.

RATING: 7.5
I am not a huge fan of abstracts and will usually choose wargames, Ameritrash or Euros over them (they'll usually pip party games though) â one guy I see at the usual lurks in Canberra has described me as "Oh yes, you're a theme guy, aren't you." So I was really surprised to find myself enjoying Dvonn.

The pieces are very well made and the rules themselves are very easy to learn but, as with all good games, there are all sorts of subelties at work here.

The game plays really quickly and cleanly and really forces challenging choices on both plays from the very beginning. I suspect that chess players would like this as it makes one plan and play several moves in advance.

If I found a cheap-enough copy Iâd probably buy one but as it is I am unlikely to knock back a game if it is on offer. Well worth a try even if you're not an abstract nut.

UPDATE:

Picked up at Cancon for $10 - easy decision to make the purchase.

Just not into abstracts. Would play this though.

You move stacks with your pieces on the top the number of spaces equal to the number of pieces in the stack. You can only move onto other pieces, not onto blank board. All stacks have to maintain 3 lines to red pieces.

Once no moves can be made, you stack up all the stacks controlled by you and whoever has the highest/most, wins.

Another winner in the GIPF series. What I like most about this series is that there is very little "overhead"...in that you don't have to set yourself up for a huge abstract mind melting epic. You can just get the game...set up quickly and the game plays very quickly and cleanly...yet with a nice amount of strategic depth to explore. MUCH better than other abstracts like Chess which I have to be in a certain mood (preferably catatonic) to even attempt to tolerate.
DVONN and the others that I have tried in the GIPF series are very "casual" games that almost invite you to play them and play effortlessly...and yet the games are pretty deep and interesting to explore the nuances of the mechanisms. It certainly doesn't hurt that the board and game pieces are very nicely produced which is a big plus for me. A good solid efficient rule set creating interesting decisions combined with very nice components insures that this game will be very unlikely to drop from it's 8 and may even edge up over time as I play the game and appreciate it more.

EDIT 2015-05-31: Note de 7.8 d'octobre 2013 revue Ã  la baisse. Bien que je ne joue pas trÃ¨s souvent aux jeux du projet, on dirait que c'est l'un de ceux que j'ai le moins envie de ressortir. Trop de possibilitÃ©s en dÃ©but de partie, j'ai l'impression que l'on peut (doit) jouer un peu n'importe quoi assez rapidement durant cette phase, jusqu'Ã  un moment dans le milieu de partie oÃ¹ l'on se dit "lÃ , il faut se mettre Ã  calculer". Je sens que l'aspect "stratÃ©gique" n'est pas assez tangible Ã  ce jeu, surtout en dÃ©but de partie.

**

Premier jeu de la sÃ©rie que j'ai dÃ©couvert, DVONN m'a immÃ©diatement charmÃ©.  On m'a offert ce jeu pour NoÃ«l, aprÃ¨s avoir demandÃ© Ã  un commis du Valet de Coeur: "J'aimerais offrir un jeu Ã  un ami qui adore les Ã©checs". Cette personne aurait suggÃ©rÃ© DVONN, sans avoir hÃ©sitÃ©. 

Le lendemain de ma premiÃ¨re partie de DVONN, je courrais me procurer ZÃRTZ!. 

DVONN est le jeu du projet auquel j'ai le plus jouÃ©, mais est toutefois celui auquel je joue actuellement le moins.

L'atmosphÃ¨re de DVONN est trÃ¨s tendue dÃ¨s le dÃ©but de la partie, car la majoritÃ© de nos piÃ¨ces est directement en contact avec les piÃ¨ces adverses. Rapidement, les piÃ¨ces deviennent empilements, et perdent alors en mobilitÃ© et efficacitÃ©; mais leur valeur augmente! Il n'est plus trop clair qui contrÃ´le quoi - et surtout: qui, Ã  la fin de la partie, contrÃ´lera quoi!.

Comme la plupart des autres jeux du projet, je crois qu'il serait prÃ©fÃ©rable de jouer avec un cadran, car sans le facteur temps, certains coups, jouÃ©s trop vite afin de ne pas faire trop patienter l'adversaire, peuvent changer complÃ¨tement la situation...

Le principal Ã©lÃ©ment qui me dÃ©plaÃ®t de ce jeu est l'aspect chaotique du dÃ©but de partie, oÃ¹ dÃ¨s le premier coup, le joueur est tenu de capturer, et que de nombreuses captures sont possibles partout sur le plateau de jeu. C'est Ã©galement le principal aspect ce qui me dÃ©plaÃ®t avec TZAAR, contrairement aux cinq autres jeux de la sÃ©rie. Il m'est difficile de savoir de quelle faÃ§on amorcer une partie de DVONN (et de TZAAR). 

Ã partir du milieu de partie, il y a un peu plus d'espace sur le jeu, un peu moins de choix devant nous, et le jeu devient un pur dÃ©lice - mais le jeu demeure assez difficile et extrÃªmement calculatoire.

Mon classement actuel: GIPF (8.9), YINSH (8.8), ZÃRTZ (8.7), DVONN (7.8), TAMSK (7.8), TZAAR et PÃNCT (-) (je ne les connais pas assez pour leur attribuer une note pour l'instant).

Fun abstrct game for 2 players. Pieces can be stacked, and movement is governed by the size of the stack. Stacks must be adjacent to a DVONN red piece otherwise they will be eliminated.

RATING: 9
[b]Length: 5/5[/b]: Probably the quickest GIPF game to date with the possible exception of TAMSK but I wouldn't know because I've never played it. The board can quite frequently be chopped in half with a single move. Potential moves are constantly decreasing, unlike in Yinsh where to board gets more and more chaotic. Analysis paralysis doesn't seem to be a huge problem in this game. For starters, the first few moves are generally kinda random, with snippets of forethought thrown in their primarily to ensure that you can capture DVONN pieces multiple times in a row in the event that your opponent counters your initial capture. But before long it's pretty obvious what everybody is capable of.

[b]Mechanics: 5/5[/b]: This game forces long term thinking, but long term in this game is "in the next 15 minutes / 10 actions". I think it does a lot to elicit the same strategic thinking as many abstracts do, but does it in a streamlined and shortened format. Depending on how the early game was played, each player will have power over different sides of the board. Setup, and the first few turns of the game itself, almost feel like it's building up to the meat of the game, which would probably be the final 50-75% of the game depending on how well everybody played. It's quite nice. It's also always exciting when a player can cause half the pieces on the board to be wiped off. It doesn't always happen, but it's a treat when it does even if it screws you over, because a game changing its dynamic so quickly is not something you see very often.

[b]Components: 5/5 [/b] I think it's worth mentioning that the components stack really well together, which is good because sometimes stacks can get pretty tall. They're also easy to pick up and handle even in large numbers. Even though none of the GIPF games are particularly hard to handle, this feels like it's the absolute easiest to physically handle to pieces.

[b]Accessibility: 4/5 [/b] The rules are dead easy to teach. They can probably be taught in 30 seconds. The problem is that the strategy itself is kinda difficult to understand. It took me about 3 games before it really started coming together, and that may have been because I was playing against another newbie who didn't really outplay me and force me to think strategically, but grasping the strategy of other GIPF games like Tzaar and especially Yinsh was quite a bit easier. That's not to say this game is more complex. In fact, it's simpler. But that first level strategy can be lost on new players for a few games.

With that said, everybody I've played this game with has liked it. Even people that disliked Yinsh and Tzaar, so I think that says quite a bit about the enjoyability for this game once people catch onto it.

[i][COLOR=#33CCFF]Final thoughts:[/COLOR] If there's one compliment I think the GIPF series deserves above all else, it's that every single game really does feel completely different from each other while still maintaining an elegance which is almost unmatched in most other abstracts. Even Chess almost complicates its ruleset compared to these games in order to achieve its depth. I honestly think these games are beaten in elegance only by Go. However, I think the GIPF series actually surpasses Go because of the fact that it's game after game after game after game of elegant design, but they all force you to think differently. Someone could be really good at YINSH, but terrible at DVONN, or great at DVONN and YINSH, but suck at TZAAR.

 It's not like these games play similarly. Even looking at TZAAR, which has a stacking mechanic and a shrinking board just like DVONN, it's still completely independent and unique. If it weren't for the fact that these games all look kinda similar, it'd honestly be difficult to tell they came from the same designer only because they all seem like classic games that have been around for centuries.[/i]

RATING: 6
First impression: The game itself seems to be one of the easier two-player no-luck abstracts. Simple rules and pretty simple to see moves even in the first games but not too easy. Only thing bothering me is the setup where you must place every piece on board before starting. This can be overwhelming for someone who hasn't played and it probably matters quite a bit too. Of course you can "semi-randomize" the setup by just whacking rings on board for beginner/not-too-serious game. One game where I really would like to have random setups... 

Rating is low because I don't in general like to play this type of games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

So far, my least favorite Gipf. It seems to lack the overall depth of the others, with the stacking gameplay becoming 'obvious' quickly. It's still fun, but is missing the subtleties of the others.

RATING: 9
Neither as original nor as aggressive as ZÃ¨rtz, Dvonn is just as tight but it develops even more quickly: even though the game is not easy, demanding lots of playing to know how to set up the pieces, it can still be played lightly. Furthermore, while its play doesn't quite reach the complexity of for example Focus, only being able to move full stacks on rings helps the game to avoid two perfect players going on forever (so does the third red ring in the board). All this adds up to a very rewarding game.

DVONN is probably the most well-known stacking game (compared to Bashni, Focus, Emergo, Abande, &c.). It is a relatively fun game, for the Gipf series (of which I am not a huge fan). But it is not quite as good as my favorite, Sid Sackson's Focus, to which it is often compared. DVONN is, in some ways, like a mashup of Focus and Lines of Action, where players are trying to form a connected group in the middle of the board. DVONN's setup phase is too long, the opening game is very opaque, the range of moves is fairly restricted and becomes even more so, until the game ends when both players are immobilized. Still, it's probably one of the easier stacking games to find sets and players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Dvonn has a simple elegance about it, both in appearance and in play.  It is far from being a simple game, however.  After playing two games I felt I was only beginning to appreciate its complexities.  I just might be able to come up with some strategies for play given another couple of opportunities.  I have the impression that this is the sort of game that grows on you and then becomes addictive.  I'm already questioning my initial rating and wondering if it should've been higher...(4+3)

Dvonn continues the outstanding 2-player brain-busting game play and strategy that I first encountered with Zertz. The game components are of the best quality. The rules are clear and concise. The replay value is very high. You can not just play 1 game. You will want to play 10-15 games to encounter the many strategies, maneuvers, best placement, trap avoidance, and when and where to "isolate and thus remove" pieces from the game. Since a game last a very short time (for us, 10-20 minutes max), you can get quite a few games in within a very short time. This one will wins some awards, just as Zertz did. Go to gamesurplus.com for some very good prices on this game and any other games you are looking for. They cross-link most of their games to this database, just in case you want the best gaming info on the internet before you buy a game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's not my favourite in the series but it's still very solid, engaging. It's all about applying more pressure on key spaces than your opponent can, and then asserting advantage with it. Zertz comes out when a 10-15 min 2 player abstract is required, Dvonn when 30 minutes is more the go.

This is the toughest of the set to master (or even understand the strategy) especially at the start where the options are so vast. Move a stack you control, as long as it is not fully surrounded, in a straight line based on how tall the stack is. You must land on another token thus limiting your moves as the game goes on. The player who controls the most tokens wins, however you must always remain connected to one of the red lifeline pieces. As the game progresses you see options and cornering your opponent and keeping the larger piles. Great game which takes a long time to master.

The pieces are as in other GIPF games': very high quality ones. The colour scheme pleases the eye and all... but the gameplay isn't as fun.
My problem is that this can really be too unpredictable. Of course it's the idea in many of these games, but I say too unpredictable in this one.

It's still not a bad game, I'd just more eagerly play ZÃÂ¨rtz than this.

A 2nd tier GIPF game for me (which is to say, I enjoy it, but not as much as YINSH or TZAAR). I find this one to be much more opaque than my favorites, though I expect that only means I need to play it more to understand it. So far I enjoy the constricting feeling of the second stage, particularly how movement options become more limited and threats of disconnection start to emerge. I have no real idea how to play well during the placement portion of the game.

Very interesting and cool mechanics.  Looks cool too which adds to the fun.  One of the best Gipf games.

Many people complain about phase one play (placing the pieces) since it takes so long, but it has its place.  Computer look-ahead software cannot play Dvonn well since a program would need to look more than 50 moves ahead to see the results of its placement, which is mathematically impossible.  This is the realm of humans.

Aah, abstracts. Like country music, a genre I care less about as games are souless, often humourless affairs in which players can display mental superiority; honestly beyond the experience of interesting mechanics/problems, what is the real point to play apart from inner chest beating? With nil to little luck there is so much dependency on opponent(s) wits to be equal for any tense situations, with no random system to provide additional considerations and to level the playing field. Ok enough ranting, Dvonn has diminishing turn options so games are short, that you may feel tempted to give it another go. Me, I can't be bothered anymore; I want fun, theme, system challenges, tense standoffs etc......

It has elements of go: 1: life. 2:Strength in certain areas, so you move in other areas.
Once you move from a spot, that spot can never be used again. This creates some VERY dynamic strategy in my opinion.

By forcing players to move in the end game, the end game becomes paramount. In the beginning I didn't like it so much, because, if you had a tiny weekness, because of the forced moves, you could lose 10-15 pieces.

It's a perfect information, pure abstract game which just reinforces why I have a hard time warming up to them.

Hard to do here when folks are thinking while playing.

I can't say enough good things about all Kris Burm's board games: Gipf, Dvonn, Yinsh, Punct, Tzaar, and Zertz. Even my 9-year-olds are really into them, and each one challenges your brain to come up with unique strategies for winning. They're brilliant in their simplicities!

This one has really made an impression on me. DVONN is simple, and yet offers a lot of tough decisions. It looks great and plays quickly. It has simple rules, yet among them some that nicely make this one differ from the abstracts I've played before. Pure elegance! (The only thing that makes me not to give a ten is that I've probably not played enough yet to see if this is going to repeat itself too much, though I suppose it won't.)

It's really different from Tzaar. I think I managed to like that game. Manage, because in order to like it, you have to really undersand it. Without that it can be daunting task to win. And if you lose you wouldn't even know why... But I want to play it again. It's some challenge for me.

If you can find a partner who enjoys abstract strategy, this is a deep and fun game. It's relatively simple to learn the basics and it's rare that someone who likes these games doesn't say "Let's try that one more time". Overlooking one option can strand a large block of your pieces. Not as complex as chess, which may be a huge benefit as it's not immediately intimidating.

One of the best abstract games I've played, been playing it like crazy over at the Golem. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An abstract game broken into 2 phases: placement and movement. Players start seeding the board with thick and chunky plastic discs. Once all pieces are on the board, players move the pieces following several rules: Pieces surrounded on all sides CANNOT move. Pieces move the amount of spaces as there are in the stack. The top piece of the stack indicates which player controls the stack. When there are no moves left, the players pick up their stacks and the one with the highest stack wins.

The twist? All pieces must somehow be connected to 1 of 3 red Dvonn pieces. Pieces that are cut off are removed from the board. As the game progresses, I am reminded the slowly shrinking Escape from Atlantis!

The placement is crucial and you are trying to manouevure pieces such that your opponent is forced into making moves that benefit you more than himself. Taking control of a Dvonn piece is important as is ensuring that you have stacks that are mobile. Good game.

It is nice to see 2 player abstracts that award the better player rather than the first player.  This is a solid abstract, that rewards replays.  The unfortunate thing about the game is that good players are just going to smash the hell out of weaker players everytime.  Normally I'm all for perfect information games, but I feel with DVONN it reflects much of what I don't like about chess.  If there is a huge swing of skill it just doesn't make for fun games.

Solid game in the GIPF series. I guess that I'd say right now it's number 4, behind TAMSK, ZERTZ, and GIPF. It's cool how the more pieces that you control, the less likely that you are going to be able to use them to increase your point total.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Good entry in the GIPF series, this one about stacking the most pieces. There's general strategy in limiting your opponent's options and gaining control of the DVONN pieces. At the same time, you can't ignore tactical opportunities to eliminate or seize control of your opponent's stacks, and choices between the two are rarely obvious. Because there are always competing goals, with a balance of long and short term concerns, the game is difficult to puzzle through. Definitely among my favourites in the series.

On of the better games in the Gipf series. I will never become an expert at this, but you don't need to with this game.

Forward thinking is rewarded, but sudden opportunities should not be ignored. Short but intense, great stuff.

This was my first time playing one of those bizarrely-named "project GIPF" games, but I am incredibly impressed!  This game is amazingly clever and quite a little mental challenge.  And I love how it builds up towards a big climax at the end!  This wouldn't be a game to play with my wife, who doesn't particularly enjoy no-luck strategy games, but fortunately I have plenty of other gaming opponents with whom to match wits.  The super-sturdy game pieces are great (even though they make me hungry when I see a white one sandwiched between 2 blacks - mmmm, Oreos...), but the board is unfortunately quite bland.  I wish they at least did some fun graphic design on it, like they did on the box cover, and perhaps even made the spaces on the board indented so that the pieces would sit comfortably in them.  But that's a minor gripe - everything else is top-notch.  And the fact that I found an unplayed copy of this game in a thrift shop is the icing on the cake!  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment; 4/5  Total: 8.5/10

The stacking game from the GIPF project. Players take turns placing discs on the board, then turns moving already placed discs and towers. A disc can only move onto a space with another disc (of any colour), at which point the whole tower moves exactly a number of spaces equal to the number of stacked discs. Additionally, discs which do not remain connected to one of the three red "DVONN discs" are instantly removed.

This is another one that feels deliciously opaque in the early game and uncomfortably restrained in the late game: the interesting part is in managing that transition. Excellent.

Based on several plays.  I overall do like this game.  I like it when games have simple rules but to play them well is hard.  This game seems very elegant and is easy to teach.  I like games that have a lower luck factor.  The problems: It has no theme and I like themes. And the bigger problem of who to play it with.  The game is fun when played against an evenly matched person who also enjoys it.  In this game (like others in the same genre) if you are better than your opponent you will almost always win.  (Note this rating only applies to face to face play, online it may be easier to play a wider variety of people).

RATING: 7
[RGG 2001 edition] {GIPF, Abstract; othello-variant} DVONN is a decent and novel abstract game. It's deep and unforgiving. It's also of good replay value. The rule is very simple. The decision tree is large in early game but it shrinks as the game board shrinks. DVONN needs careful planning since the start of game. Don't mindlessly lay down the 'pieces' in phase 1.

Game pieces can be made smaller. (Actually, all games of GIPF can be made smaller.) Game board shall be shaped to hold the pieces more firmly.

Just an amazing concept and we have made our home made variant (rating based on that). WE played this almost every day from Feb. to May 2012, probably played 400 games of this. Usually with a chess clock. There are couple of amazing things. 1. The game starts out with billions of choices, even more so than chess, but unlike chess it has no endgame to drag it down, the game will end within a set number of moves (we play on a different board and our games last 21-25 moves). Once the game has been set in motion with the first 18 or 20 moves or so, that's it, you win or lose. It doesnt go on forever with some stupid endgame mistake.

It has taken me some time to identify my rating for this game. Although I enjoy playing it, it seems so chaotic. The winner is decided by the last 5 moves in the game, in my experience. The strategy is very difficult to catch on to. We are beginning to use strategy better, after 30 plays. 

I may change my rating after another 30 plays, only time will tell.

Dvonn can have a noticably different feel to it from game to game depending on the starting locations of the Dvonn pieces, which really adds to the replayability.  Since each move produces an empty space on the board that can never be reoccupied, the game moves at a nice tense pace in which you can feel the end coming.  Good game.

La primera vez  que juguÃ© con un amigo, nos dimos cuenta que este juego era un JUEGO.

Esas rosquillas rojas y esos saltos, la colocaciÃ³n inicial, como mover una para que luego te la quiten, barajar las posibles acciones, intentar robar esa torre de punto, o como desconectar los para bajar el nivel de puntos, cada vez que se reduce a la mÃ­nima expresiÃ³n el tableroâ¦ cuantas cosas para un juego y un reglamento TAN SENCILLO.

The game is simple to teach and exciting enough to sustain my girlfriend's interest. That is definitely a plus. Dvonn really reminds me of Hey That's my Fish. The core concepts are similar: Moving pieces to isolate your opponents and cutting off movement by holding out on critical choke points. The game has very few rules, but i must say it is quite tense. It is also very unforgiving. A wrong move here is enough to ruin your entire game. Great abstract game!!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Quite possibly my second favorite game in the GIPF family. I was turned off from trying this initially due to the weird movement rules and the twee design of the board (Pieces in the sand! That's deep, brah), but the improved design of the 2017 printing drew me in and hasn't let me go.

This has a really interesting, direct arc to it that actually manages to create some drama for the final moves, and once players wrap their heads around the basic rules games can be incredibly close.

TZAAR may end up being the deeper, more interesting game, but DVONN has set up shop in my heart and won't be leaving anytime soon. So glad I took the plunge on this one.

RATING: 7
A solid abstract for any collection, even for those not interested in the wider series. Compared to Zertz, Tamsk, and Gipf (the others in the series that I've played), this is much more approachable. Play time is reasonable, and the game is easy to explain. It's sort of Chess-like and familiar in the importance of threats and counter-threats, but there are so many possible interactions on the board that it discourages paralysis. And the game is very dramatic in the way it quickly evolves, with the formation of large stacks that can move across the board and disrupt what once looked like stable positions. Of the four GIPF titles I've played (which doesn't include Yinsh yet, notably), this is definitely the best intro game and the best suited for more casual players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Supremely elegant. As the field shrinks tension mounts. 

Positioning during the setup phase is very important. It is quite fun to put the red Dvonn pieces in 'crazy' places. 

The end game is often very interesting where the game state can be highly âunstableâ. 

I wish there was a travel edition.

DVONN is fascinating, but I always end up feeling frustrated at how arbitrary the end-game feels given my (and often my opponent's) inability to see certain game-changing events coming. If I played this game more frequently I'm sure my enjoyment would only increase. As is I think it's a real solid design that challenges me in a unique way. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
DVONN is played on an elongated hexagonal board, with 23 white, 23 black and 3 red DVONN-pieces. In the beginning the board is empty. The players first place the DVONN-pieces on the board and next their own pieces. Then they start stacking pieces on top of each other. A single piece may be moved 1 space in any direction, a stack of two pieces may moved two spaces, etc. A stack must always be moved as a whole and a move must always end on top of another piece or stack. If pieces or stacks lose contact with the DVONN-pieces, they must be removed from the board. The game ends when no more moves can be made. The players put the stacks they control on top of each other and the one with the highest stack is the winner.

Truly delightful to play. Like many others, I first viewed placement as being somewhat random; now I appreciate how easily one can lose a game through poor placement -- and how many layers of strategy are possible throughout the entire game.

Simply beautiful.  The acceleration of the game is good, though I wish the initial placement felt more meaningful.  Fantastic abstract, and very approachable for non-fans of the genre.

Doesn't exactly fit into the series, though, as it doesn't have much in terms of sacrifice and unintuitive tradeoffs.  Not a knock, just an observation.

One of the best 2 players abstract strategy game EVER. Like many of the GIPF Project, Dvonn is extremely elegant, balanced, simple yet deep. Dvonn is a game which all abstract designers should look at for comparison to judge their productions.

wow. A ton of really clever things going on in this one. After playing this, had to lower my rating on Zertz by a point. This just feels so much more interesting, without the forced move/exchange thing that Zertz has.

[b]MUCH TO ADMIRE.[/b]

A game of two halves, literally: a setup phase, and the placement phase. Comes with a full set of - what looks like - speckled plastic polo mints. There is satisfaction to be had from the placing and moving of these marvellous pieces. I just like the stacking of gamepieces, I suppose; it's a geek thing.

This game has my mind spinning with plays. I have no cohesive strategy formed whatsoever, and have also yet to see a cast-iron system of plays.

I'd been eyeing this from afar for quite sometime before asking it for a dance!
I like what I see so far, though I rarely get the chance to sample its abstract delights. The game's not brilliant, but it is rather good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Quick stacking fun on a shrinking board.  Options quickly decrease as the game goes on and it can get pretty tense... but it still plays suprisingly fast.  Occasionally you can count ahead and see who has won before the end, but this doesn't detract from my enjoyment.

The first time I played this game, I didn't really enjoy it.  Then one day I was compelled to play it again based on the realization that I had made a critical error the first time through, I had played with the convex sides of the pieces up!  Needless to say, once I rectified the problem, the game significantly improved.  This game is increadibly FUN.  UPDATE 10-05-05:  Something about this game bugs me.  I'd much rather play Gipf or Yinsh.  This has kind of gone the way of Zertz for me.  Was formerly an 8, now it's a 6.  I don't know what happened.

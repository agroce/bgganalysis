Tactical combat based on ancient Greek mythology. What not to like, it is fast, the font size could be larger as unit abilities are so important but not very legible, it uses light wargame rules (LOS, range, opportunity fire etc.) and it is rather unique (damage allocation and art of war mechanics) and plays differently every time. When progressing from initial scenarios setup will take longer but this is where the game really shines. Artwork is strong/bloody and a bit same-y, little chits on the board and so you have to focus really hard to differentiate units from a distance, not a game for the ageing gamer or people with poor eye-sight. Expansion adds more units. Gameplay reminds me light war-games (hex and counter) and focus is on individual unit management and strengths (a single strong unit can wreak havoc and win battles).

Fantastic 2-player Card Drive Miniatures Game Hybrid with
absolutely BAD ASS ART! =) Love it.

You draft an army, with one legendary creature backing them up. All of your units usually have special abilities that are paid for with power that you obtain by either discarding cards in your hand or killing other units.
Play feels quick as players activate one or more units at a time only if they have a units corresponding maneuver card in their hands at the game. Defenders can also counter-attack simultaneously in reaction if they also have their unit card in hand. Very nice!

Unit abilities, plus Art of War cards add a ton of tactical options in combat.

However as units start to die and you get below a certain threshold the games mechanics do get slightly finicky with you having to discard entire hands of dead units for 1 power each, you and your opponent both often doing this until one person "finds" the next unit he has alive.

Pros:
Beautiful Art.
Great Mechanics & Tactical Variety (more than W40K)
Unique Die Mechanic to Apply Damage.
Quick Playing & easy setup.
WAYYY Cheaper than Miniatures.

Cons:
Only 2 Factions.
Pogs arent quite as cool as Miniatures.
Mechanics get Finicky when left with few troops.

Picked this up totally blind to what was in store for me and the game group. Once this hit the table it was a guys favorite, sadly the women in the group have not fallen in love with it. Maybe MBP will change that. Still this game is right up there with Merchants of Venus and Twilight Imperium (Third Edition) for the group with the 2 box expansions.

This game has some very interesting ideas, but unfortunately has a lot of pitfalls. Unit stats changing as the unit takes damage is cool, but you have to constantly ask your opponent, "What's that guys defense again?" Exploding dice are cool, but the rolls aren't cumulative, so rolling two 5's doesn't give you double the damage. Special abilites are cool, but they're all so specific that I'm constantly re-checking the (labyrinthine) rulebook to make sure I have everything right. Ultimately disappointing, but with some house rules can still be interesting.

Only played the basic version so far and seems fun. I'm looking forward to using the full rules to see how it all works.

Fast and furious. Death everywhere!

The cards mean it's a longer setup - but short and fast game play. Which works very well - if the number of cards can get a bit overwhelming.

Has some interesting styles of play.

Edit: the abilities don't add too much more (rules wise) but bring a lot more options in game - so get into the full game quick and have more fun! We sat on the learning steps getting bored for too long!

Very good ancients/Greek Mythological themed lite wargame. Card driven activations limits what you can do each turn, and enables you to react to your opponent, and to power up abilities and effects, all of which add fog-of-war - lots of unit abilities to mix up tactics. Unit factors deteriorate as your unit takes hits. The lack of a morale system, flanks or zone of control make this a skirmish style game, but a good one.

Your units are represented on the board by tokens and a set of unit stat cards - the art is excellent and all are good quality - minis would be a super enhancement.

RATING: 6
Similar to Manoeuvre in feel and play; which one you'll prefer is a matter of taste. I found the army building a bit tedious and the profusion of keywords rather tiresome, so I think I'll be sticking with Manoeuvre.
There's also some really regrettable graphic design decisions. The movement cards, in particular, are poorly laid out, so you have a bear of a time fanning them in your hand effectively.

Wargame ligero con tema que mezcla fantasía y mitología, tiene mecánicas interesantes y novedosas: la forma de sumar los dados en combate, que en teoría reduce el azar, el desgaste en nuestras unidades y la limitación en las activaciones, lo que hace que tengamos que planificar muy bien el momento de activar cada tropa sobre el tablero.

Initial Rating: 5.5 (March 2015)

Mythic Battles has a very good theme and after reading the rules I expected to like the game. It seemed to me very similar (in essence) to Mage Wars but they play very differently.

The rules are easy to grasp, but there are many so the first couple of games will be slow. A minor dislike for me is that I have to constantly check the game manual to see the talents of the creatures. Another minor dislike is that the deckbuilding options are very reduced with the creatures from the base game only, you almost have to use all of them In each game. I guess the expansions fix this. The art is pretty cool, but the tokens are too small so you can miss them easily.

After playing the game, I can say It is an ok game for me. The way you can activate your units seems great in paper, but it was a bit boring for me. Perhaps it resembles too much a wargame for my liking and after many games I’m coming to the realization that most wargames are boring for me. You would think there is a lot of luck in the game, but I found it to be controllable (Using talents, power, and art of war cards) in its majority so it doesn’t bothers me.

I really liked the way the creature health is handled, each hit can change the creature stats, neat. The combat is also novel.
 
My copy of the game came with a damaged card and a French campaign manual, IELLO customer service is one of the best I have the pleasure to work with and I got my replacement within days which is much more faster than most game companies.

Bottom line, Mythic Battles is an ok game to play from time to time. I generally don’t subscribe to the philosophy that a game replaces another BUT I would never want to play Mythic Battles over Mage Wars if I have the time or Summoner Wars if I don’t. I will probably sell my copy of the game. I expected a better game.

Setup of this game is pretty cumbersome and the different artwork of the same unit makes it confusing and gives a feel that you have an overwhelming number of different units. Gameplay itself seems fine but not amazing in any regards. The way combat damage is resolved seems unique but I don't know if it adds much to the game. Since you need the corresponding card to activate a unit, there is also quite a bit of hand management involved in this game. It can be frustrating at times when your strong units are halfway across the board and you have the ability to move them over but not to both move and attack, but adds some strategic planning too to the game. For example, if you focus fire on an opposing unit and/or isolate several of your opponent's units away from the action, you can make several of your opponent's cards near useless. Also, you can e.g. discard an Art of War to search for a specific card that is being attacked in order to counterattack. Besides terrain effects there is spatial advantages to e.g. having a tight formation in order to spread damage around via defending or vice-versa if your opponent has spread damage.

I'm still not sure if turtling and letting your opponent come to you is the optimal strategy, but other than that I've come to learn some strategic elements of the game through repeated plays that I initially didn't realize. These include positioning your units so not to block LoS for your units while doing so for your opponents, making it difficult for your opponent's range units to move around by running up to them, and focus firing to prevent healing at the reshuffle vs. attacking a unit that you can reach in a more advantageous position/do more damage to.

Wow. This game is excellent on so many levels. It's a minis game, with pog tokens instead of minis. While stand up cut outs would be much better, these tokens still work, and keep the game's cost down over using actual figs. It incorporates a dice, card, and tile board mechanics to make this a unique system.

 The dice mechanics in this game is very original and works like a charm. Attack dice are rolled to hit a target defence number. Once rolled, you can use one of your dice to add a +1 to another die. Excellent mechanic that will usually land you at least one hit, even if you roll low on all your attack dice.

The artwork is incredible. Some of the best I have seen. The cards have a lot of info on them, but very easy to read and understand. They also represent the HP of the unit. If a unit has 5 hit points, it also has 5 cards, each one with the respective HP number on it. When you take a wound, you remove a card from the stack in descending order. As the HP decreases, the units stats may change as represented on the card. Their attack, defence of movement may go down, or up. Very cool mechanic.

The tiles are 5X5 squares and you use 4-6 of them. There are several in the game which are double sided so you have many options for building your play area up. And of course there are varying terrain types with modifiers for the units on them.

RATING: 7
This game is like a mix of Summoner Wars and Memoir '44.  It has the potential to be really great, but I hate the disks.  It is too hard to tell the units apart on the map.  Everything looks too similar, even the units on the cards.  The unit cards would also be more useful if they would at least summarize the special abilities.  Then, you don't have to keep referencing the rulebook/cheat sheet. So much potential, but I'm not sure I want to invest the time to memorize the special abilities.  I'll just play Summoner Wars instead.

Game quality: 

Played scenarios 1-2. First one was close, but it was an ultra neutered version of the rule set since it didn't use cards and other aspects. Second scenario ended up being far more one-sided, but I also misplaced a tile so Athena's armys had an advantage there and used it rather well.

The learning curve is a little drawn out for my taste. I would like it better if Art of War cards were used in scenario 3, but you need to wait until scenario 4.

Proper organization can really help with set up to where it should be rather quick.

Score: 7-8ish.

Would I buy this again if I was starting over: Lean, yes.

Do I want to play this if asked: Highly liking as I learn the game better. Seems to have some potential.

Overall: Deciding...

Rating Potential: Way too early.

Kudos to the Mythic Battles 2.0's look-now-we-have-minis Kickstarter hype train fanboys who've spammed my BGG home page out of the realm of usability for several consecutive days. They reminded me I've actually played the original half a dozen times around release and I dedicate them the following.

Although they try their hardest to scream "I am different" (activation deck containing wild cards, wounded units have lowered stats and a custom way to assign damage from the dice pool), the game's gimmicks are mere decoration and don't make the gameplay really different from the vast competition in the 1-on-1 skirmish genre. Thus while it's perfectly functional, Mythic Battles is also very very forgettable.

Skirmish games are not my favourite genre but there is a lot to like in this one. Each unit has a stack of cards, one card per remaining health. As it takes damage, cards are moved to the bottom of the stack, revealing one with lower a health total and possibly also diminished movement, attack or defense.

Activation is also done extremely well: each unit has a number of activation cards, shuffled with the other units' cards into a single deck. A unit can only be activated by playing its card. More agile units get more of these cards and can be activated more frequently. 

Rules for terrain are intuitive and the special abilities (only described in the rulebook) are easier to remember than I had feared.

Unfortunately, while the system is polished, it isn't particularly exciting. There is little variability in abilities. With time and expansions it could be an all-time classic, but for now it's forgettable. Rating: 6.

At least, the rating would be 6, with the potential to rise, if not for the components. Mythic Battles feels very much like a miniatures game without miniatures: it uses cardboard discs with pictures of the units instead, presumably for cost reasons.

These discs are a usability disaster. Some are difficult to distinguish up close, let alone at any distance. This would have been solved by using either abstract symbols -- such as a bow and arrow icon for an archer -- or miniatures, but with the current artwork the game is all be unplayable.

A related issue, though less critical, is the difficulty in seeing enemy unit statistics and abilities from the other side of the table.

If you read through the forums, you'll see Mythic Battles being compared to Summoner Wars a decent amount. I find that comparison both apt and unfair. On one hand, Mythic Battles differentiates itself from SW through i) a more interesting combat system that takes into account a defensive stat and utilizes exploding 6s, ii) dynamic stats that change as units take damage, iii) limited and strategic unit activation, and iv) more unit abilities. On the other hand, when you play through both games, you end up with about the same feeling. Stated another way, while Mythic Battles gives player more meat to chew on, the end result is not necessarily better than SW -- and, actually, the streamlined design of SW goes a long way in making it the better of the two games.

Apparently, Mythic Battles is getting a redesign in the form of Mythic Battles: Pantheon, so anyone interested in the game may want to hold out until the redesign is launched.

Not sure If I need another skirmish style boardgame, but Epic Battles does offer some fresh new mechanics, like for example the unit decks to keep track of a unit's abilities after suffering hits. The dice mechanic is one that I really like, enabling a player to roll successive dice on each "5" result. So gameplay wise it is an interesting game that can also be played relatively quickly, and I am looking forward to exploring it more. Too bad the components are pretty low quality (the cards are very, very thin) and the artwork does not appeal to me.

Interesting skirmish game.  The artwork on the board, cards, and tokens is nice.  Introductory scenarios walk you through the rules.  Once you play with all the rules, the game becomes less of a dice fest.

This game is good!  The artwork is simply fantastic and the gameplay is engaging.  I don't have a problem with the units being tokens; the battles are still intense and challenging.

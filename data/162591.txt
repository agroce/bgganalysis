I love dice in real-time which in this game are perfectly integrated with other mechanics. The game is stressful in a best way. You're in hurry all the time, you see your HP going down and try to be quicker than you opponent. Very fun duel.

I'd say that this is a combination of Space Cadets: Dice Duel and Pixel Tactics. If you like these games, go on and buy Heroes.

PS
The prototype name of this game was Mage Duel - I liked it better.

Edit:
I've played final product. The artwork is AMAZING! This is the most beautiful game ever! I just don't like the cover...

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
I am not a huge fan of the real time dice rolling mechanism, however when I read that this one took that mechanism, and combined it with Magic: The Gathering, I got very curious.  I am still not a big fan of the mechanism, but this is a unique game that is pretty fun.  There is a ton of replayability in the box for building armies, and there are a ton of spell cards, and you will not even use half of them in the game.  I do plan to get in a few more plays to see if this grows on me.

RATING: 7
I also have the 4 bonus monsters (Giant, Cerebus, Kraken, and Pegasus) from Spiel 2015.

The Rahdo review of this game made it look sort of fun. I'm not a big fan of dueling type games, but I think the dice rolling makes this one a bit lighter and more appealing.

Played 4-player, but without using the official 4-player rules (we played 2-on-2, sharing a common card display, and ended it when one player was eliminated). When we first got started, it took a few rounds to get the rules down pat, and to be honest I was expecting the game to suck. But once we got going, it was alright.

The real-time dice rolling is not the greatest. The way to play is to decide what you want to do and then roll as fast as you can until you get the dice you need for that action. If you don't focus like that, you'll get slaughtered by someone who does. I feel as though there's a better way to accomplish the resource-gathering, but I'm not sure what that would be.

If rolling six dice over and over as fast as you can sounds appealing, you will enjoy this game. Probably a lot. For me, it's just OK.

The 4-player game took a lot longer than 30 minutes. I suspect that a 2-player game will go by much more quickly.

Un juego ideal para jugarlo a 2.
Con un arte muy bueno. Facil de aprender y fácil de jugar. Muy divertido ya que dependes de los resultados de los dados para poder hacer hechizos para atacar a tu adversario. Muy recomendable la verdad.

 What is unique about this game is dice rolling, what I don't like about this game is the dice rolling frenzy.
 If you take away the dice rolling you have just another average two mages fight each other until one has lost his about 20 lifepoints. The colors on the dice should have been much brighter = better distinguishable.

Joc de combat entre criatures i un avatar que representa el jugador (amb capacitat de llençar conjurs). La base del joc és el llançament simultani de daus per aconseguir el "mana"/ordres necesaries per llençar conjurs o activar unitats.

Llençar daus simultaneament esperant una tirada en particular? Això ho diu tot per a mi...

RATING: 8
I almost gave this one a 9 rating, because I play it with a group of very competitive close friends. We attempt alliances that fall through before they are formed and derive more fun from yelling at each other than the actual mechanics.

The mechanics themselves are solid and the game can be fun for 2 people playing, but that's not its full potential.

I really liked this! I feel it's principally a two-player game (it CAN play more, but probably shouldn't). As such, I wish they'd sell it cheaper by providing enough dice for two players rather than four. It's a fun two-player experience for fans of realtime games.

Played at Essen 2015

Game would be fun without the real time dice rolling - each player rolls their dice at the same time as fast as they can and the first one to achieve his desired result screams stop. 
Without this game would be a great mix of dice and deck building mechanic. I am thinking of a variant without the real time dice rolling but with the rules as written i would probably not play again. For people who enjoy the real time dice rolling i would rate the game an 8.

Heroes is a dynamic real-time game for 2-4 players, in which players become true heroes of a magical fantasy world, possessing great powers related to different elements: air, water, fire, etc. and leading powerful fantasy armies. They send their creatures — such as dragons, elementals, ifrits, hydras or gnomes — to a battle against the opponent's troops. The aim of the game is to defeat the opponent's hero and army.

Have to look at more...

Very thematic artwork and component quality makes this Magic The Gathering style game fun to play.
The streamlined combat and easy set up work well.
I'm looking forward to many more plays of Heroes.
After a second play with 4 players, I am convinced that this is really a 2 player game and I would not want to play with any more players.

Essen 2015 purchase. Very interesting game with a mix of many familiar mechanics such as deck building, deck pre-building, drafting, duelling etc. 

Neat! 2-player game is really good and fast paced. Love how quickly this game plays. Everything makes much more sense now and play is very intuitive all of a sudden. Excellent 2-player duelling game.

Scoring after just one play and only basic rules involved. Did not have a chance to compose my own army of monsters.

What I liked in the game is real-time experience. It brings tactical game to a new level where downtime problems does not exists. If you think too long you are simply dead. But it has downside as well, as the game does not give a chance to make decent combo of cards. Instead it turns into fast rolling challange to activate your own dragon before your opponent will do the same. I have a feeling that all other cards are simply not relevant.

Need some more duels to make a final verdict and decide on scoring.

26-06-2015. Rated after 1 play of the start scenario. How t describe this game.. it feels a little like Magic meets Escape..

You play to defeat your opponents summoner, who starts at 1 health and is protected by creatures in front of him/her. All players start with a deck of 9 cards, 6 dice and 10 resources worth of units they have selected fitting the dec of their summoner. In the advanced game you 'draft' these, in addition with 3 cards from a central offer. 

Each round consits of two parts, one realtime resource part and one unpaced execution step. First, players roll their (typically) 6 dice in order to get mana symbols to cast spells, OR card symbols to obtain new spells for your deck or draw cards. You can reroll dice as long as you wat until an opponent says stop. The player who said stop is the active player for the non realtime part. In the unpaced part, you can draw and buy new spells (into hand), or cast spells from your hand and active creatures. If you cast a spell, you may active creatures if you have additional command die-faces rolled. Attacking creatures damage opposing creatures or summoner if there is no creature blocking the attack in front. If you ever shout stop and cannot do anything, you are punished with 2 damage. In addition, each caster has a color preference and 'hates' another color. If you ever take an action, and have dice of the hated color you take 1 damage per one of those. After you have performed your action, your opponent may take his action if he has the dice for it. If not, the palyer who yelled stop first, has to reroll all 6 dice. if the non-active player didn't perform an action, he may continu with the dice as they were before the 'stop'.

Game is fun. I like it, mostly because the realtime is just for resources. The game may have more depth than apparent, not it feels like a quick slaughterfest. I like it though, it's MUCH better than Berserk, Summoner Wars or games of that ilk. It will never beat Magic though!

I thought the real time elements were kind of neat, but this is a really crowded genre and I am not sure if this game is exceptional enough to differentiate itself.  More to the point, I have other two player duel games I would rather play over this one.

:) Simply fun to play
:) Real time mechanics work great
:) Plenty of options and replay value
:) Good 70s artwork style

:?block: - I think a non real time version would work well, for those that don't like that. Yet there is no official variant in the game. 

:soblue: Though fun, repetitive 
:soblue: Dice colors could be better
:soblue: Could have use more variety in the creatures and spells, instead of so many copies of each.

Fantasy card game duel with some similarities to MtG using real time dice rolling phases to generate a pool of resources used to deck build, command units and generate the elemental "mana" needed to cast spells. Played on battle mats that double as player aids. I like the 2 row display to see current and upcoming spells to draft and that you can pay a premium to draft from the latter. I like that the real time action is only in the resource pool phase. This accomplishes three things, it bypasses mana drought, it allows respites to determine your next move, and it adds a level of excitement. Some intringuing characteristics and it tugs on the fond memories of my MtG days in a fresh and fun approach.

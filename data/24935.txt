A dungeon crawler game with cards. The small selection of missions (especially final ones) makes it a little dull after some plays. Great artwork and atmosphere.

If it is mixed with the expansion (Beyond Good and Evil), it becomes deeper and faster (especially with the Crisis! element).

I'd LIKE to like this game more, but it really doesn't carry its weight.  The artwork is AMAZING, and you'll hear that everywhere.  The problem is that the game tends to stagnate.  Playing with 5 players is usually a poor idea because there are exactly enough characters for everyone to get 4, so the variance is very low and you'll have a very hard time filling any missing roles in your party.
The rules are poorly written and miss a lot of common situations.  A number of cards are equally obscure with inconsistent terminology in some places.  It really is unfortunate ...  The idea is there, but the execution is not.

Great artwork on what is primarily a vapid game.

In order to get an additional party member, you have to get lucky.  Once you get a new party member, it is easier to get more.  So, if you get unlucky at first, you can get set back quite a bit while other players amass lots of power.

Once they get that power, they can complete their quests and win the game without much effort.  It is anti-climactic.

Aug.2008
Excellent art.Poor card quality.
Solo is a little bit boring but it can happen.
The rulebook is not clear on many things and the descriptions on many cards are confusing.
The game is much easier than the rulebook suggests.
You would think that it is a great crpg (I thought too) but then you play it and something is not right...(it is kind of stale and there are few cards)
I have to play some more to make up my mind

A nice card game with fantastic artwork. Put together a party of explorers to complete your mission from a choice of two.

But the revised editions give nicely tweak of rule making the game really playable under reasonable hours.

The game is a mess.  the artwork is this faux-anime style that looks more ripped off than iconic.  The gameplay is terribly random, and frustrating at all levels; frustrating early to build a team, tedious in the middle game to get things done, and awful in the end to try and finish it.

While the art is amazing and the little story bits are interesting, this falls flat on it's face for me. The rulebook is written poorly, the concepts are clunkily implemented, there is WAY too much random element deciding if you do good and the game can potentially (and did feel like it) last forever, as everyone tries to fulfill the end goal and keeps punting each other out of the region in question. If they are not screwed over by the bad luck of the dice and then cards that is...

I gifted it away to the guy who liked it. I will probably never play it again.

RATING: N/A
This seems like a cross between Dungeoneer and Testimony of Jacob Hollow but with an anime theme. You can use the official "Tree Structure" area rule included in the manual to cut down on the luck factor caused by exploration. Their are countless ambiguities in the rules which tend to lead to arguments, which in turns spoils the atmosphere of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Really crappily written rules (aka Fantasy Flight Games rules)(check out all the confusion present in the Rules Forum section), even after this being a "Revised Edition". Seriously, game publishers, quit trying to make a coffee table booklet ABOUT the game and just write an instruction manual on HOW TO PLAY the game.

Also, the rule book doesn't actually fit inside the box! It's about an eighth of an inch too long and you have to fit it into the box bent.

Even this revised edition is in dire need of a FAQ. Card interaction problems abound without being addressed by the publisher.

Take an epic journey to the fantasy world of Gaia with your party of great heroes, to complete a quest. on the way you can complete sub quests, so you can create a stronger party. That is the story of Anima, a great card game, with very beautiful illustrations and a beautiful full color rulebook. And with a little imagination you can create your own Quests, Areas of the world and Encounters for your heroes. There is an expansion on the way, with more characters, skills, areas, encounters and quests. You can create many epic stories with this role playing card game. A great game.

This game could be much miuch better with an expansion. The rules itself are not so bad, but is not well balanced, we changed the 6 sides dices for 10 sides dices for combats, it added a lot of play value. I would like to see more character, better balanced and more quest, then I would gave this game maybe around 7, in his current state and with 6 sides dices, it barely gets a 5 from me.

I thought this would be a great game with it's gorgeous art.  After having played it however it's really quite dull.  I dislike that after you have a party built up you don't even need to roll a combat dice because you're going to automatically win some combats.  I think it could be an excellent game if a second edition was released with some tweaks to rules/combat.  A revised edition was announced by FFG recently, so I'll have to check out the rules online when they become available.

To steal a line from another player, "I heard version two is coming out soon, it's just a sock with quarters in it you hit other players with."

This game was just painful and overly complicated. Had a Munchkin vibe, and I don't like Munchkin, so at least I'm consistent. I heard a rumor that the person who ran this game totally maimed the rules, so I guess I could be gulled into playing again.

What a joke. The game goes something like this: "i want to recruit, roll 1, ok, do nothing." Next Turn:  "roll 2, ok do nothing". Next Turn: "roll 4, encounter (before recruit), ok, you turn ends immediately" etc, etc.  Whoever doesn't roll bad or get 'your turn ends' encounters and builds their party the fastest, wins. Could be the worst card game ever.

Good game mechanics and nice artwork.  Cards themselves are a little bit too flimsy and will need to be protected in card sleeves.  Character interaction is high and I've had no problem with the "runaway leader" that everyone seems to talk about.  There is a fair bit of sheer luck involved in reaching your ojective but then, it's a card game with dice, so what do you expect?  I'll play this again and again - once I get some sleeves...

I have grown a little tired of card games with special abilities. The common problem is that you have to play a few times in order to know the decks and the game play usually don’t stand up for that many plays. However, there aren’t that many cards here so you will know the effect of the cards during your first play. The downside of this is that you play through the decks in one game.

Since I have only played once and we had a hard time to iron out some of the rules, which are vague and unstructured I can’t give a definite conclusion, but my guts tell me I prefer a real board game to this, maybe [thing=27627]Talisman[/thing]. The play time seemed to be longer in this than I was expecting, but once again it might be a hasty conclusion from my first play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
For some reason it reminded me of Talisman. I'll say that in a good way. What is not good is that the game SCREAMS for an expansion and that above all the encounter and power decks feel repetitive even after the first match. 
It is long, going well over two hours to play. 

As it is my first game, I'll give it a "6", I expect this to change.

Almost completely random, uninspired and unoriginal adventure game with trivial decisions. The cards are ridiculously unbalanced. Random encounters range from free treasures (or a free character) to the most powerful enemies and cards that simply end your turn. You can also have no encounter (and thus get a free reward) if you roll the die well. And there is at least one stupid rule: If you already have four characters and want to recruit another, you must discard one at the beginning of your turn - before knowing if you will even be able to recruit any! On top of all that, add quite a few "take that!" cards and unnecessary PvP confrontation to slow things down. The very nice artwork is the only reason I rate it above 1.

This game really is more intresting about its awesome illustrations rather than raw gameplay. The encounter deck is very predictable and encounters are really just too easy or way too threatening. Oddly the most easy missions are also the ones that, once completed, provide the best bonuses while the most difficult ones are not rewarding enough. The interaction between "parties" (i.e. players) are one of the funniest part of the game but it presents itself as an adventure card game and not just a run to stop the "winning player", thing that lenghtens playtime a LOT. But dudes... those artworks... :D

Good artwork (I think it's artwork from the Roleplaying game it is based upon), but with some art-designing errors: mixed artwork of very different styles, and dark images losing detail because they have been printed too dark.

The cards are thin and need sleeves, but once sleeved won't fit back into the box :-( 

The rulebook seems comprehensible and of good quality (the Spanish version is OK), the game mechanisms are straightforward and unoriginal, but they work well. You travel from a Location card to anther, drawing cards of random monsters and completing quests. Some card interaction can be tricky, but overall is easy to play.

The expansion (Anima: Beyond Good and Evil) gives this game the necessary number of cards to work properly.

This is a decent game, its a pretty good adventure board game, its cheap and its easy to play, the art alone makes this buy worth it. The only complain i'll give is that most fights you will win 90% of the time and not much your opponents can do really, and on top of that you end up NOT fighting maybe 60% of the time, they should have let each encounter have different stats for each level so that you alway fight and so you would have such easy fights (level 1 enounter on a level 3 area). And they should have made art for the quest cards.

A very light RPG-style game. If the game took longer to play, it probably wouldn't be as good. Its just too random and lacking any meaningful decisions to be taken as a serious game. However because the game can be played in 30 minutes, its actually an enjoyable dicefest. Just roll and hope to kill the monster.

On top of that, the art is top-notch and very well-suited to the cards they represent.

RATING: 7
Finally got the chance to play this game.  Basically, this is a card game, based on an RPG world inspired by such JRPGs such as the Final Fantasy and Suikoden series and in a lot of ways feel similar to a card-driven Talisman.  The big difference is that instead of equipment, you are much better served by trying to recruit party members.  You do have a hand of cards, which represent spells, equipment, organizational bonuses, etc. that you can play to enhance your party in other ways.

You also get quests, which, when you fulfill certain pre-conditions, gives your party a bonus, and also reveals the main quest, which when completed, wins the game.

I really enjoyed this game.  The mechanics and art feel just right.  My big gripe is that it just doesn't seem to be enough cards.  In just one game (and it is a fairly short game) I think we went through the character deck twice, the enemy deck at least once, and the advantage deck (items, organizations, spells, etc.) almost 3 times.  This game needs 1 or more expansions hella bad.  I'm sure with an expansion or two, my rating of this game would go up at least half a point.

But don't misunderstand me.  This game seems like it would be great for a few playthroughs.  And with a few more cards, the replayability would really increase.  A great, if somewhat limited game.

In terms of play, this is an unexceptional entry into the "RPG as board game" category.  However its components are deeply atmospheric and the entire game fits neatly in a compact and highly portable box.  These two qualities endure that Anima will see regular play.

Some very interesting stuff with this one.  The art is great and the mechanics make it feel like a video game RPG.  It's worth playing, but after a few times I was bored with it.  Game play takes a really long time and there were many rules that I found confusing or poorly explained.  This might be fun if you really like longer more role playing style games, but once I got over the novelty of the system I found it tedious.

Just too much luck (and i like afair bit of luck) - roll a dice (and hope its high) then draw a card and hope it's low... do that for a while until someone wins or you all give up mumbling about 'futility' and shit...


Shame as the artwork is really nice.

The best RPG adventure card game system.  It encourages you to build up a team that is right to achieve objectives of the adventures, beating monsters before the final treasure.  However, before facing off the final encounters, you need to upgrade yourself with artifacts, equipment and add comrades to your party.  You can try to travel a bit to find your artifacts or bonuses before going to the final destiny, at the same time competing against your opponents' teams. They can attack you if you are both in the same area.  If the opposing team joined an organization that is hostile to your own team's one, combat is mandatory. The characters are horny with a taste, while the myths and environs are esoteric to the locations.  All the cards are lavishly illustrated. I have every minute of fun while traveling, collecting and combating  in the game. And thanks God!  I can get a revised edition - new!   

My favorite Advantage cards: Betrayl!, Only a Dream..., Light Maiden, Avatar of Death, Succubus, and Romance. My favorite character cards: Thief, Paladin and Illusionist.  My favorite Area cards: Archangel and Hecate

[Played 2 times]
Nothing original, very random gameplay, some ambiguities in the rules, poor rulebook (e.g. the last page of the Italian edition, with the summary chart, is in French!). 
It is quite bad with just two players (runaway leader: you either attack him to stop him, and thus you can't advance your own position or you try to outrace him hoping in a major stroke of luck, that is unreliable and totally out of your control. Besides, you can easily spend more than half of the game without being able to do anything as the locations you need aren't available).
Cards varying wildly in usefulness and power (being them resources, enemies or missions; each category is unbalanced within itself) don't help to ease the experience. And there are dice too, to further move gameplay beyond any possible planning and skillful play.
Maybe marginally better with more players (at least you can take turns bashing the leader).
If it wasn't for the artwork ("fantasy manga"), no one would have ever noticed this game.
It also lasts way too much for what it is (a light, random, overcomplicated, mindless filler with cool graphic and nothing more).

That game is a game of luck, luck is everywhere when you are pulling of the place for your quest, meetings, combat.

If you do not have a chance you lose your turn and you look at the others playing.

The game is too long for what it give.

Not having the possibility of replacing a character in his team, not enough cards, mission unbalanced, progression is painfull but became easy at the end when we have 4 guys, and it's so cheap that if an opponent is having less cards than the other, he can recover a cards.  At the end you are just fighting against your opponent to prevent them doing the final mission and after that they do the same to you, it's a never ending story.

The game became repetitive really fast and boring since we are just throwing dices and are at the mercy of the luck.

Cards are too hard to read!!!  Otherwise, reminds me of playing Runebound mixed with MTG in an express setting. None of the charm of either game, though. Not a bad experience unless you manage to get stuck with low-ranking characters and lack Advantage cards--that's exactly what happened to me so that every time I went to a location I was getting hammered by baddies that others were taking down without even rolling dice!  Nice idea, needs some improvement.

The adventure genre done in a style that agrees better with me --ie, doesn't take as much time as runebound and cie :)  Game takes 1.5/2hrs, has interesting decisions, and a nice story arc.

This is a game that does dungeon scrolling simple and fun, something that Dungeoneer needed in my opinion.

A fun little card game.  Normally I don't enjoy card games all that much, but this one is different.  It plays best with 3 or 4 players, but it is doable with only 2.  The game reminds me more of a cross between an RPG and a miniatures game with respect to how you build up your party and try to meet your victory conditions, while at the same time thwart your opponent(s) who are attempting the same.

A very nice light card game with a lot of luck involved. I'm still bitter that Milan Spiele sent me the original version even though I ordered the revised edition. We would've needed the Crisis implement, since the only problem was the endgame. The current final mission demanded that a player stayed there for two consecutive turns. Something always kicked him away.

Well, this is fun, but needs a bit twisting before that.

It took us a couple of years to get this played, but I'm really glad we did. It was the expectation that had hindered us from playing this, my SO always thought that it was too complex while we were going through the rules, but once we did and started playing we both noticed that this actually is quite light - without sacrificing the fantasy-adventure-theme. It's like Runebound, but with only some decks of cards and that plays in about half an hour. Really looking forward to gettin' this on the table more!

RATING: 7.6
A brilliant game with absolutely gorgeous artwork. Hell, if you want something pretty to pin on your walls just take the cards. The only flaw is that with the AMAZINGLY well balanced set of cards/countercards, you can't actually get anywheres if someone is following you. In a five-player game, you don't have the power to shut down enough people before they rob enough of your stuff to prevent you from completing the final mission.

Hopefully the upcoming expansion(Anima: Beyond Good & Evil) will fix this problem, but even if it doesn't, I'm buying it the day it shows up at my LGS. The art is just tooooooo pretty.

If you enjoy roleplaying while playing a game, this is also excellent for it, as each character you control is very distinct and fun to use, with the few permanent cards that do exist making for great themeing abilities. (Selene, a card that lets you incapacitate one enemy character every turn, with a better chance of success the more women you have in your party, is absolutely brilliant.)

Not a long game, but too long for a filler. Also, there's too much luck and little strategy in this card game. However, its simplicity, portability, theme and great art make in part for its shortcomings. A reasonable casual game that aims to be something reminiscent of what a Final Fantasy (or any Japan videogame RPG) card game would be. Best when played together with its expansion because it greatly increases card variety and also best with at least 3 players. A good option for those that are into fantasy themed games, but not into colectible card games.

It feels fiddly in all the wrong ways. Lots of protocol, not a lot of things to do (move, roll, move roll, roll yawn). Theme is shallow, narrative almost non-existent. Might work better with more people, because the game itself is just not done well. As for roleplaying aspect... what? where? There is none. It's a dry dungeoncrawl of sorts.  

It's better if you play with just 3 characters each. And better if people play aggressively. From what I've heard it's the people (interaction) that make this game. But even then you can find something better to play.

EDIT: time passed, I played many boring as hell euros, so I thought I'll give this another try - just soloing it. This is a badly designed game. Period. Repetitive, unthematic: roll a die or draw a card. Badly designed cards which don't really do anything - plus this, minus this, protection from this, blah blah. Theme never shows its face, interaction is just blocking and annoying people. The game is less than the sum of its parts which is embarrassing as it literally just is some stuff thrown together. 

Munchkin is way better than this.

La idea es buena. Las cartas son bonitas. Incluso, una vez que sabes jugar, los turnos son rápidos...
Pero el juego se hace eterno, para lo que es (un filler).
Aparte, el azar cobra mucho protagonismo. (Tal vez demasiado)

Card, Adventure. Rating after a 2p game. A nice light fantasy adventure card game. Not a ton of depth here and I'm not sure just how much replayability there is, although this could be mitigated by publication of new cards periodically. I'd like to play this with more players to see if/how the dynamic changes, since trading and PVP may be significant factors in enjoyment. The cards are gorgeous, if you like the anime art style.

I really, really want to like this, and I do! It's just...

I like the artwork, atmosphere, and gameplay mechanics, but it takes too darn long to play. I gave it a chance after the first couple of games, thinking that a wonky mix of cards was to blame, but after five plays, it clearly takes too long for what it delivers. Most of the Advantage cards and character abilities are of the 'take that' variety aimed at stopping other players. So, a game with competitive players will take forever. My last game, I quit playing Advantage cards against the others, hoping that someone could build up a strong party and get it over with, and then I started getting upset because everyone was still trying to stop each other from completing their missions, and then everyone else got upset because the game just kept going on and on, and then we all decided to quit. We never quit.

UPDATE: I do like the atmospheric Anima world, and it drew us into yet another game. We had an obvious leader during the game but nobody bashed him so the game played out in a good amount of time and we all had fun. I sure wish that there were less 'take that' cards and abilities, and more 'benefit myself' cards and abilities.

One of my first purchases due to the anime art.  This game has been replaced with much better variations of the game, but is quite simple once the rules are picked up.  Overall, okay game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
No bones about it, the artwork on Anima's cards is outstanding. I played this a few times using a solitaire variant in the forums; it has no pretensions of being anything other than a pretty little hack'n'slash title and in practice that isn't far off (even if it is troubled by the occasional vague rule.) What Anima really needs, though, is more cards - more missions and final missions above all. The game feels awfully samey awful quickly once you've hit all three final missions, which is why I can't give it the six or seven it's shooting for.

I still want to like this game long after we've given up on it. The big problem my group had when playing it was how often Encounters were simply "Your turn immediately ends" or similar. Maybe if those cards were removed from the deck it would be a bit fairer.

...but I doubt I could ever convince them to play it again to test this theory.

Anima is a fun adventure, but not a good game. 

As an adventure - The theme and art are very enjoyable, feels very much like a jRPG put to paper. However, the size is such that it might be repetitive after a few sessions. Would have been much better as a bigger game, with multiple expansions.

As a game - I have to sound like a eurosnob but unfortunately this game really does boil down to the luck of the draw - some event cards can set you back an entire turn, while others give you a full turn's worth of reward at no cost. You could try to play it as a "gang up on the leader" game but even then you'd need to have a good hand to try. It's kind of sad really since the system is actually pretty good, but the cards needed a whole lot more development to make the game meaningful. It's still worth two or three plays for fun, just to experience the adventure.

Interesting concepts, poor execution. Challenges are too hard for small parties and too easy for large parties, so there's not a lot of incentive to try anything other than build a full strength party and go for the win. A lot of "take that" in the game.

Not a whole lot to this one as far as strategy goes, but it's fun as a filler and is easy to teach.  If you're into theme it can be good stuff.  The artwork is overhyped... truth is it's too dark to really appreciate, but it's ok.  Will probably pick up the expansions, however, as there is a lot of potential.  A Dungeoneer-lite, if you will.

Played 2-player and think that this game would be better with 3 or more. Essentially a "travel-around-have-encounters-skill-up" game. The "New Horizons" mechanism is quite neat; 2-4 locations are always accessible, and if a player finds a new location, it replaces one of the revealed locations. Does give a sense of travelling even though there's no board. Plays a little long though - my first 2-player game took almost 2 hours!

The heart of the game is really the Event cards. Cards such as "Romance", and "Assassinate" really create a sense of story between the heroes in your party and other parties. And the artwork is lovely for anyone who appreciates Anime.

All in all, a lovely little package.

Rules were a little bit tricky at first glance. Turned out to be an interesting game for me but not so much for the second player.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It is a pity that this game is a little steep to get into for non-gamers. Main problem is that it plays as a CCG (lots of unique "Advantage" cards) and that some of the cards (especially the Mission cards) have lots of text on them. Some of the Areas that your party can visit also have lots of text on them, which makes it hard to identify whether this is the place you want to visit from across a medium sized table.
In addition, the game feels unbalanced because of the many "Take that" cards it contains, and the few cards that benefit your party. I can imagine that a game would take ages to finish if played with a group that is determined to make the most of their cards.
Still, I would not mind playing this game again with the same group. The theme is great, the artwork terrific and the base mechanics of the game are fine. I would love for Fantasy Flight to publish an expansion with more treasures and less banes.
As it is, I would recommend Dungeoneer before this. And to play this game with a maximum of four players (downtime can get pretty serious when you need to read all the cards on the table).

Nothing original, very random gameplay, some ambiguities in the rules, poor rulebook (e.g. the last page of the Italian edition, with the summary chart, is in French!). 
It is quite bad with just two players (runaway leader: you either attack him to stop him, and thus you can't advance your own position or you try to outrace him hoping in a major stroke of luck, that is unreliable and totally out of your control. Besides, you can easily spend more than half of the game without being able to do anything as the locations you need aren't available).
Cards varying wildly in usefulness and power (being them resources, enemies or missions; each category is unbalanced within itself) don't help to ease the experience. And there are dice too, to further move gameplay beyond any possible planning and skillful play.
Maybe marginally better with more players (at least you can take turns bashing the leader).
If it wasn't for the artwork ("fantasy manga"), no one would have ever noticed this game.
It also lasts way too much for what it is (a light, random, overcomplicated, mindless filler with cool graphic and nothing more).

Played once, but the other players were unhappy enough with it that I'm unlikely to get to play it again any time soon.

Start up is a bit rough with one character in the party who kept dying before another person could be added.

Also, the Final Quest card we got was unclear as to how anyone else could win after one player completed the first half, with the other players apparently only able to stop the player from completing the quest to win.

I love the art, and think with a few house-rules (like maybe starting w/ 2 characters), it could be fun, but I doubt I'll get to try it again with my current group.

In my one play of this, I drew a location that was Level 3, which then drew a Level 3 monster encounter that killed my only character and forced me to discard my card, and then once I started to get going again, with a true band of characters and a full hand of advantage cards, my opponent drew the major missions after completing both of his minor ones, when I hadn't been able to complete any of my missions because the locations required to complete them never came up in the game.  It was incredibly frustrating, and the entire game felt like it was out of my control and was a slave to randomness through the die rolls and the card draws.  I'd like to say that I saw some promise despite all that, but no, it just looks like a mess of mechanisms that don't gel into a proper game.

This game is best described as [I]Final Fantasy The Card Game[/I]. The artwork is great. As a stand alone game it could definitely use more cards. You will cycle through them more than once during a game. You do however have the option to add the cards from the two other games in the series (I play this combined with both [thing=63385][/thing] and [thing=40483][/thing]). The game is probably best with four players, but I think it would take too long to finish for me to enjoy it. I will keep the game in my collection to play as a two player game. The linen cardstock is great (English second revised edition).

I have the earlier version of the game. Too fiddly to be played in the time of 100mins that is suggested on the box. It's interesting at the start, but less so after you've cycled thru the advantage/character decks a few times. Pretty pictures though. The crisis addition, to the final mission, seems to be an official mechanism to stop a game that drags on too long. 

The cards can be interesting tokens for other games.

Anima: The Shadow of Omega is a non-collectible card game set in the same original setting as the Anima: Beyond Fantasy roleplaying game. Inspired by well-known Japanese video roleplaying games such as Final Fantasy and Suikoden, the world of Anima features traditional Western fantasy staples, including magic and medieval arms, combined with an emphasis on martial arts and Eastern concepts of honor and mysticism. In the Anima: The Shadow of Omega card game, players form a party of four adventurers that explore the land and engage in combat with fantastic beasts and each other, gaining new powers and eventually confronting an ancient menace.

This is an interesting game.  On the one hand it has beautiful cards and art... on the other it is very simple rules wise.  It really depends alot on what the players bring to it.  If played in with the right players in the spirit of adventure... it is fun.  Sadly though, most eurogamers/wargamers are going to find the game a little too simple without enough "meat" to keep it interesting.  That said, I like the game and am hoping that expansion will be introduced to make the game more challenging.

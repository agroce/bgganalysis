It&#039;s a decent family game but the original two player rules didn&#039;t work. Very beautiful when setup and some mild strategy. Goofy point system which GMT didn&#039;t help by not providing enough money for payouts.

Although I'm a naval enthusiast I like this game more than Clippers. Also the railroad theme makes more sense.
This game has some strategy and a bit of luck. Good player interaction. Sometimes you have common interests (another player with the same city card). Sometimes you don't. But this adds a nice diplomacy element, which is always fun.

I really like this game, even with the random card draws. Then I read the rules and comments for Clippers. So I bought that game, and I'll have to see if it clouds my view of Santa Fe Rails.

RATING: 5.5
After all the Santa Fe hoopla, this finally comes out, and... it's okay, but I thought there'd be more "game" there.  It feels like no matter what you do on the board, it all boils down to drawing the right city cards.

RATING: 5.5
This game delivers a kinda weird experience: it has many great elements, and many of them have been used by Alan Moon himself or others in later designs... but the game experiennce is quite frustrating. 
It seems there's a lot of decisions to take, but at the beginning of the game they're based on no other than the hope to draw some cards, while later in the game one feels it's to late and the early decisions are irreversible.
Furtermore, the game is a little longer than needed, and the end game revolves around trying to draw a lucky city card...
Not a bad game, but a little unrefined and it feels quite dated.

This game has dropped a bit. I'll pass on a 5 player game and only play in a 3 or 4 player. city card randomness weighs to heavy on the out come of the game. I'm hoping the advanced rules help mitigate this by making connection cost more for the big 7 point cities. It can still be a fun game though.

I like the essential elements of this game a lot, but I prefer Clippers' style of openly and clearly displaying each player's destinations.  I got tired of having to look at each player's cards and not knowing what I would be drawing next.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Enjoyable game.  The luck of the draw toward the end is a bit annoying... everyone draws city cards, trying to get the most "free" points from well-connected cities.  The bulk of the game is tense and interesting, though.  It plays and feels like Transamerica since you often secretly try to get other players to do what is best for you.  That said, Santa Fe Rails is leaps-and-bounds ahead of Transamerica in terms of strategic gameplay.

Possible Variant:  Charge $1-2 for the 2X card.  Since the card is uber-powerful and in limited supply, this might make it a tougher decision and make it less likely that one player is "skunked" out of the 2X card for most of the game.

A bit more complex than the original, which extends the playing time perhaps a little too much but needs more plays to be sure.

RATING: 7
One of Alan Moon's best efforts, this reprint is a good entry for GMT. Some of the stuff they've added is gratuitous and therefore a bit iffy (mainly, the Short Lines), but more options is good I suppose and you can always play without them if you like; certainly, there is no reason to hunt down the original anymore as this is a superset and of superior quality. Santa Fe will certainly appeal to fans of Union Pacific, although UP edges out SF in quality in most respects (it is the later game, after all). SF is a very "defensive" game along the lines of Samurai: don't open opportunities up for the player to your left, and jump on anything the player to your right offers. Random turn order, if it could be done very fast, might help the game a bit.

RATING: 6
It is hard not to compare this to Clippers, one of my favorite games - an auctionless shareholding one at that. And by comparison, it fails. The game is deep enough to feel skewed by the pretty massive amounts of luck generated by the city cards. But beyond that issue, Clippers feels much tighter in terms of choices and game flow. SFR has such outrageous bonuses that the early game (double goal cities with double new city bonus is just insane) is dominated by bonus chasing. Then, once the rails are pretty well developed, folks settle in to city grabbing. This late development of cities just aggravates the luck of the draw problem. All this said, it is a good game in its own right - a worthy heavier family game up there with Airlines Europe.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Requires hugely significant decisions to be made with no supporting data, and by the time you do have any data, the decisions are almost meaningless.  This leaves the players making critical decisions without grounding, and then attempting to support them via high-luck card draws.  Not a good mix. Clippers is the far far better game of this pair.

Based on one playing.  You can see a number of ideas that came forward (in one form or another) into Ticket to Ride.  This is a game about building rail networks as opposed to completing routes, though.

Still learning, but I like this game a lot. The only mitigating question in my mind is the time factor. The closer to an hour it plays, the more I want to play it. Last play was closer to 2 hours, but including learning. I'm guessing 90 minutes might be average.

I didn't feel like I had many options in the game. In the early game, track laying seemed obvious, and in the late game not many good choices still exist. I felt like either I had one choice or no choices. This could result from the way the short lines were revealed from the deck.

GMT Games.  This is a decent railroad game.  It's not as difficult as the 18XX series, yet much more involved for strategy than a lot of the basic railroad games like Union Pacific or Ticket to Ride.  The game design is very solid and most gamers like Santa Fe Rails.  This is more of a moderate to heavy euro style game and is fun to play.

Production: Adequate board, cards, art, and rail pieces.  Play: Fun game successfully mixing together secret objectives, racing, and directing the commonly-owned tip of a railway.  I feel that the bonus cards didn't add to the game.  I'd rather play Ticket to Ride, because of its set-collection aspect, and relative elegance, but this title has its own merits. (1 0 3) (1 play)

What a downer. We did play with the original rules and not the GMT ones but it was too easy to disrupt "enemy" lines. Who won only depended on who drew the best cities it seemed.

RATING: 6
Remake of Alan Moon&#039;s limited edition Santa Fe. Lovely components highlight the German production and assembly. Players score points for constructing the major railroad lines across the United States. Along the way, players play city cards up in front of them. Each city card has a value, which is multiplied by the number of rail connections to that city at the end of the game. Bonus points come in the form of being the first to connect each city to a railroad, and following historical railroad paths. Special action cards add a nice layer of decision making to the mix. A very good game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Takes a few playings to appreciate the subtleties of the strategy.  There's a fair amount of luck in the card draw, but it does seem to even out if the game lasts long enough, and the tactical tricks are more important anyway.  I think I like it best as a three-player game.  Shame about the misprints.

A soulless, plodding game of tactical placement of train links. Often tends to be defensive. Lacking in tension and fun. A third-rate retread of Wolfgang Kramer's Wildlife Adventure.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Interesting to see the lineage between Union Pacific and Ticket To Ride as manifested here.   Instead of investing in different train companies, you are essentially investing in cities and trying to get as many different companies to connect to those cities.   The flow of play is a bit clunky, but it works.   Laying track towards the end of the game gets a bit tedious, as you have to figure out which is the least bad of many bad options.   Would play again, but would probably always prefer his other train games over this as well.

Liked my first game of Santa Fe Rails. This game was a nice surprise.

I have heard some comparision with Clippers. I prefer Clippers than Santa Fe. Reason why I prefer Clippers more than Santa Fe is because Clippers has less luck and more calculations, it's also less random.

Production wise, could be better. One of Alan Moon's best.

RATING: 9
I'm more than a little suprised at reviews that claim SFR is difficult and overly long. IMO this game plays easily and the cards are what makes it different each play. New players tend to focus too much on collecting $ but after a game or so they see the light and tend to develop their strategy. The 2X, 3X and 4X cards are a lure that traps a beginning player and if they focus too much on those cards they don't seem to get as many city cards out. Overall I think this GMT version is probably best without the short lines. I can see the origins of Ticket To Ride in SFR and if you don't stay on top of the remaining rail sections for each line your plan can fail. Another thing I really like about this game is that you have an opportunity for defensive plays that don't penalize you as they do in Ticket To Ride. I am very happy with SFR and will recommend it to any fan of train games, resource management games and economic games.

It's very ok.  Turn order feels way too important, as too often you can only guarantee yourself a good move if you go first or second.  Then it's a lot of drawing cards from the deck and hoping you get the high scoring ones.

I want to like this one, but after two plays, I don’t think we’re a match. While there are some interesting decisions (which card to take on your turn), there seem to be some false choices as well (playing low value cities; these are to be discarded as you fish the deck for the 5-7s). 

Early on, the game offers reasonably interesting track-laying decisions and moves you can set up with regard to future turn order. Later though, the game devolves into fishing the deck for lucky card pulls. The arc of the game had a narrowing effect such that interesting choices slowly dried up towards a lackluster endgame. Even with limited track, I find that cities get too well connected such that you can't play defense on someone. You may play well, but the player who pulls those well connected 7s is most likely gonna win. The overall experience was one of disappointment as it started out so promising.

Four of us played our first game in four hours.  It is listed as a 1 hour game.  The rules are not difficult, although poorly written, and there was some thought during a person's turn but not enough to drag it out like that.  The short rail lines showed up at the very end of the game, and some of the players thought the game would not have had an "end game drag" if the short lines had appeared earlier in the game.  Certainly the first half of the game moved very fast.  

I like the game better than the others do even though I did not come in first.  I am sure the next game will play faster, but the others don't see how it could be a 1 hour game.  I think 1 1/2 hours.

Lured in by the theme.  But it turns out the "boomtowns" controlled by players are drawn completely at random.  So players draw cards and try to "lure" the railways through their towns for bonus end game points.  Fun enough but the theme is pretty unrelated to the game play.   And why would players own boomtowns spread all over the west at random.  Wouldn't the guy in charge in Las Vegas be more likely to have control in Phoenix than in, say, Canada?  I can only assume this is a re-theme of some earlier version of this game.

This may be a gamegroup-thing, but I'd rather call this a disconnection game than a connection game. With more than 3 players it's almost impossible to plan anything. Instead you just have to do something on your turn and hope that it will be remotely helpful. Too often people do stuff just to make sure that nobody gets anything, instead of trying to help their own positions.

Playing with the original [b]Santa Fe[/b] rules, this has become my favorite train game.  To me, a railroad game should be all about the connections, not an excuse for stock manipulation ala 18xx.

For two players, use the variant that the first-player indicator is swapped when its current owner plays a x2 card.  We also play that only one player can claim each city.

Updated version of Alan Moon's homage to Wildlife Adventure.  Not much has changed from the original Santa Fe.  One of the new features is the minor railroads, and I'm not fully convinced they're a good idea.  They appear to make access to the lucrative western cities too easy to achieve, exacerbating the luck of the draw.  But I might be wrong.  I've never tried Clippers, Moon's alternate Santa Fe remake from the same year.

One play with four. Not sure what to think about it, since apparently I didn't play a very good game, but there were a number of little things that left me unenthusiastic.

I also felt like the game kept going on past the point where it was interesting.

But it always seems a damn close thing, in the end it comes down to who drew the good cards. (meaning, if a city had been made worth 10 and you drew the card for it, happy days.  If you drew a town worth 3 that makes you the loser).

I've only played about 8 times, so take what you will from the above statements.

First played this game on March 13th, 2007.  We looked at this game as a possible play at a game night at a local store.  When asking the owner if we could play it, he mentioned that it was a quick play.  The box even says 10-45 minutes?  What?  It took a while to read through the instructions and we played it wrong in some instances.  And needless to say it took a long time to play.  Also the owner said that he didn't like ticket to ride (TTR) near as much as this one.  Well after playing, it did seem like fun, however I don't know if I would put it that high above ticket to ride.  From what I remember of TTR it did seem like it had some good strategy, however this definetly had more options and thus strategy.  I'm not sure how it would play quicker however?  I think it took us around 90 minutes.  Having said all this, it's worth a game play.  I'd like to play it again now that I understand what your suppose to do and how to play.  I'd recommend having someone explain the rules that has played this before since it can be confusing from an initial read.

Alan Moon's heavier rail placement game that predates Ticket to Ride.  While still a lighter weight game, there are more decisions going on here than TtR.  The city card draws  gives it a bit of randomness and in my opinion a bit more fun than the related "clippers" retheme which can become too analytical.  This set also has superior components than Clippers.  This appears to be GMT's first attempt at a larger game with Euro components and they nailed it with nice wood bits, nice cards, and a mounted.  One can only surmise it wasn't a financial success as they didn't do a mounted board, euro-component games again until 2007's Winds of Plunder.

Once I had played Clippers, this I modified my score on this game.  IMHO, the random nature of your terminals makes it inferior to the control one has with the ports in Clippers.  However, this is still a great game, and the historical bonuses makes this one different enough to keep both.  Of course, sometimes, I just have to play with my trains.  :)

Another Alan Moon train game.  Not up to the same level as Freight Train or Union Pacific, but very enjoyable on its own.  Some people here do NOT like the smaller train companies, but I find that using them makes the game more strategic.  Random card draws make every game different... and tons o' fun.

I think this game can be broken by one player carefully managing to deny the 2X card to other players, thereby giving that player sole access to using it.

Some people don't think this is problem. I do.

RATING: 8
Sure it's true that too much can turn on the luck of drawing some good cards at the end of the game.  Nonetheless, the competition to pull as many rail lines to your cities before they run out of steam always makes for a tense game that I love playing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Simple rail game with a high luck factor. First, each player draws up to four cards. Most of the time, players take a destination card but they have the choice to take a special card instead, e.g. a permit to branch a line or to lay additional track. Simultaneously, all players play one card from their hand. Two construction rounds are played. Without any special cards each player is allowed to lay one track in each round. Bonusses can be gained for the first connection to any city or connecting specific railroads to specific cities. At game end, the value of each destination card in front of a player is multiplied with the number of railroads connected to this city.

The trade-off between playing one of the powerful special cards instead of a destination is interesting. Interaction is always present with players more or less subtly trying to influence track-building to let others connect own played and unplayed destinations. But ultimately, the final scoring can be a letdown. Drawing valuable cards already connected by others can play as big a part as decisions. Grabbing each route-building bonus and just playing the highest scoring card each round is a valid automated strategy.

The luck of the draw and a few rough edges (e.g. boomtown cards are mostly useless) keep it from becoming a favorite. Nonetheless, for fans of railroad games the network building part will be satisfying. A nice diversion although surpassed by Moon's later variations on the topic.

RATING: 7
A very cool game with a lot of decision making in terms of what cards to grab each turn and where/when to build.  Not too much luck, and a good challenge.  I like most rail games, this one is no exception.

Preferable to Ticket to Ride, and even Union Pacific.  The only thing Union Pacific has on this one is the ability to accommodate six players.  I like that this game has more decisions to make than Ticket to Ride, but still maintains a short playing time.  However, these games are all different enough to warrant owning and playing them all.  This one has, for some reason, a slightly more realistic theme too, not that I know anything about railroads... Warning: the game can end ridiculously early if players run the major lines into dead ends and you're not paying close attention to how many tracks are left to place.

A very excellent early game gets bogged down by a very random luck of the draw end game... I'm going to try playng without the minor rails because I think that will make the game less of a crapshoot.

RATING: 3
Best off playing Clippers instead. As this is a later developement of those rules Santa Fe Rails is needlessly fiddly to play. One has spend too much time constantly scanning everyone elses city cards to see what routes not to connect wheras in Clippers there is a control marker for each player on the map. 
Using the cards for cities makes the game more random but makes the game cumbersome for the above reason. Also using cards for the Branch lines rather than ship markers in Clippers makes it harder to spot the end or the rail lines.

Playing this version of the basic game engine one spends too much time looking and fiddling with cards.

A larger map with room for control markers and ditching having to keep refering to the cards would help a lot.

Did I say this was fiddly to play? ;-)

I think I prefer this over Clippers but not by much.  Clippers has more of a "pure" abstract, "no luck" system whereas SFR has some luck involved with card draws.  Both have subtle differences that make each interesting.  Having tried the original Santa Fe (White Wind edition), I will readily play either SF or SFR with either rules set.  Thankfully, the map board and cards can be easily converted to the SF version without difficulty.  Santa Fe Rails is more complex than SF.  SF is more elegant, streamlined and more controllable and manageable (especially w. five plyrs) than SFR.  I love the tension of doing something to help one's self at the risk of giving opportunities to your opponents.  There's a balance of risk & risk.  The more I play SFR, the more it grows on me.

It's tempting, given the theme and designer, to say this is a Big Girl version of Ticket to Ride, but I think it's actually more of a grown-up TransAmerica in a lot of ways. Either way it's a pretty good game. You have to decide between the lure of immediate, big points or the long game of possibly even bigger points. A solid design that could use a nicer reprint.

2-5p, 60m.  2002 Alan Moon train game.  Some compare it to an "adult version of TransAmerica."

My thoughts based on first play with 5 people:  This game is all about delayed gratification since you are never sure of your score or relative standing until the end.
Don't let the "Simultaneous Action Selection Mechanic" fool you.  This is a turn-based, connection-building game with potentially lots of down-time and virtually no player-interaction.  I say virtually because turn order matters a lot, so if you are last, then all the "good" cards from the face-up selection might be taken.

Probably better with fewer players.  With 5, it took us well over an hour to play, and the down time [albiet AP-induced] bothered me.

Acquired in trade for Il Principe in mid 2006.  Traded away in March 2007 for a box of ShadowFist boosters.

As far as rail games go - I prefer the cleaner Ticket to Ride with its more intuitive scoring and gameplay.  This one seems a bit convulted and constrained.  Overall, not bad, just not that exciting either.  Furthermore, there is too big of a luck factor when drawing cities. A player can pick up a large number of points late in the game by pure luck.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I gotta say that I like clippers better, if for nothing else than I think the map grooves better. The random destinations can suck a bit, as you can either score big or get screwed big depending on what is randomly drawn. The boomtown cards can also be really nasty, severely crippiling someone who spent a lot of time to get to the west coast for big points. Otherwise, a really fun and enjoyable experience.

I dunno if I will buy it because it's *so* close to Union Pacific (for me, anyway), but I still recommend it and would play it anytime.

I've dropped it from my want list only because it's pretty much the same game as "Clippers", which I have recently acquired. I'd still rate it "9", slightly better than "Clippers".

Now, bear in mind that my rating might be just a bit influenced by the fact that I'm a complete and utter sucker for railroad games. While Santa Fe Rails may not be an absolutely essential purchase even for a TrainGameGeek like me, its refreshingly different take on rail network development puts it solidly in my top three of "choo choo" related activities, just below Age of Steam and my Märklin Z scale set.
The shared rail line building and the different special action cards take a few rounds to get used to, but they provide the game with just the right amount of variety and agonising decisions. The game bogs down just a bit towards the end when the lines become almost too convoluted to follow, but that is to be expected in a railroad game.
I rate the game itself a solid 8 to 8.5, but with the added historical detail the whole package deserves a 9. Great stuff!

Tense and fast-paced railroad game which looks similar to Ticket to Ride but plays nothing like it.

Wow, much better than I expected.  I think it's a little too easy to score at certain times of the game, but that fact is balanced by drawing more city cards.

Like Kramer's Expedition, this game feels more like it's about steering than anything else--you're trying to make sure a number of railroads go to certain cities that will score you points, but any player can add to any railroad (but only at the head).  In this way it feel different from other rail games--you don't own railroads or even stock in railroads, it's more like you own stock in destinations.  The game also had some on-board scoring where the first player to get to a certain place would score, which created some issues where players needed to avoid setting up other players for big payouts (and yes, this means you want to be to the right of a lesser player).

The end game kind of bugs me.  Waiting for all 5 major routes to end or get trapped can be tedious.  I'm still looking for a quicker end game trigger. Also, everything this game has has been done better by Clippers, which gets rid of the silly stacks of cards and limits the extra routes (which are too abundant to be of much interest).  In Clippers, you know what cards people have through the whole game.  Here, each player relies on cards, which alters strategies and may give someone a windfall late, though they had nothing to do with making the city a windfall.  And the damn box is ugly, too.

Most of the changes from the original version are for the better. Good tradeoff from short term - go for the doubles and connecting cities to the long term collect cards for payoffs.
Highly competitive as you try to steer the major lines to your cities while interfering with the the plans of your opponents.Some times you must let an opponent get a bonus so the line goes your way.
I prefer more random approach driven by the cards to the more deterministic approach to clippers.

A game that takes several plays to make sense. Starts out a little slow but heats up as the board fills with tracks. Nice components, especially the chunky wooden tracks.

Still, it's a lot of fun.

It seemed as though the 2-player rules were unbalanced, but our game was fairly close.  Perhaps a few more games will tell.  At any rate, I love route building games, even if they are somewhat pre-programmed.  You don't HAVE to try for the bonuses :)

I want to like this more than I actually do.  The game works really well for the first 2/3, but then the game devolves into a city draw fest in hopes to get a high scoring card to scoop up all the hard work that other players have put in.  Those that draw the best at the end likely win the game.  Kind of lame.  

The easy answer is it play the superior Clippers instead, but there are really great elements to this design that were phased out.

The only solution to this that I can think of is that the game end with all but one one major company running out of trains, rather than all majors running out.

It is pretty ballsy that this came out the same year as Clippers.  This version reveals how great Wildlife Adventure is.

Perhaps I'd like this game better if the cards were more intuitive, but without text, some of them are confusing. Also, if I'm going to play a train game, this isn't going to be the one.

The mechanisms in this are quite clever, and while players can adopt varying strategies, the final scores are usually quite close.  Whether those scores are high or low depends on how cutthroat the group is, but they should stay close either way.  As a bonus, the combination of immediate and endgame scoring makes it tricky to correctly identify the leader, so I see no kingmaker issues here.

Wow, there's a lot of luck in this game.  Draw the right city cards and get paid off at the end, draw poor cards and you lose!  Hooray!

1 play, 3er, published rules.

Wow, that was fun! It's a network-building, economic/stock game. You can see some elements from Union Pacific and the Ticket to Ride series here, but I liked this much more than either of those! The special cards are very attractive for building track and going after connection bonuses, but the big value comes from stock (city) ownership; if you play too many specials you won't be able to play city cards! There is plenty of tension each round in deciding which card to play, and how to extend each train line. Should you divert a rail head (and hope you don't later draw the city card you diverted the line away from?!) or work on connecting your own cities? Can you bluff well enough to get other players to connect to your cities for you?

After one play, seems to be a great game! Need to try it now with the original Santa Fe rules, as well as the Clippers version.

--- Summary ---
The deck is composed of city cards (with some short lines shuffled into the middle third). Players have a hand of 4 city cards to start the game. Each round, players simultaneously select a card to play, then reveal. City cards are added to your personal display -- essentially, you have a share in that city. There are also several special cards (2x, 3x, 4-in-one, Branch Line, Boomtown) that modify the basic game turn. These specials are on public display, and can be acquired at the end of each round (some cost $1; the 2x may be held, but the rest must be played immediately after acquiring them). 

Then, in turn order, going twice around, players add a single track to any of the railheads (each of the 5 lines has specific starting locations on the board). If the link is to a previously unconnected city, collect $2. In addition, if the city is one of the goal cities of that train line, collect $4. 

After all players have gone (twice), pass the start player marker to the left. THEN, in turn order, players bring their hand total back to 4 (draw from deck and/or from cards on display). If a Short Line card is revealed, discard the card and draw again; that Short Line is now in play. They choose a card to play, and repeat above.

The game ends when 3 (or is it all?) track lines are completely used up. Each city's value is equal to its base value, printed on board, multiplied by the number of different train lines connected to it. The player with the most cash and city value wins!

RATING: 7.5
The learning curve was a bit steeper than usual for me.  It took me about 2/3 of a game to have a good grasp of the rules and form a strategy.  An enjoyable game that doesn't seem as tightly designed and fluid as Ticket To Ride or Union Pacific. Of course, those are great games to be compared to!  My biggest complaint is for a game that takes 90-120 minutes, the draw of the cards, especially at the end, can make a bit too much of a difference and give someone the victory.

RATING: 7.5
Based on a lot of plays.  This has been one of the better games I have to play with non-gamers, and new gamers.  Enough luck that everyone has a chance and feels into the game, enough strategy to feel like you can control and affect the outcome.  The one down side it has is the rules for what the special cards to do and how they are played are kind of fiddly and sometimes hard for new players to get.  Understanding the card play has been an obstacle some of the times I have played this game with new players.  Even still almost everyone I have played this with has liked the game and wanted to play again.  This game has for me been a great gateway game for non-gaming friends/family that has caused them to be interested in board games.  [update] over time compared to new games the rules in this game just seems less streamlined or polished.  Dropped my rating by .5

The "complexity" of this superb game would be removed completely if GMT had written the abilities/conditions of the special cards (2x,3x,4-1,Boomtown) on the cards themselves. Just a line or two of text on each card. *Anything* to keep you from having to dive into the rulebook. Seems like an obviously helpful ergonomic decision to me.

Do yourself a favor and paste up your cards with this information.

RATING: 6
Meh. Superficially, you place track (with many elaborations) to satisfy goal cards. The amount of track you lay matters less than how many goal cards you put down, which is rather antithetical to a rail game as usually conceived. To be sure, steering the various lines toward your cities will help, but in a game where you may put down over a dozen goals, formulating a strategy from the first few you see is futile. No ownership of rail line; no stock either.

This game has a couple of flaws in my opinion that keep it from being a top-tier game.  Firstly, it feels like there has to be too much attention payed to not setting up the player on your left.  Whoever gets set up the most scores the most in many cases.  Also, the fact that there is one less 2x card than there are players means that someone gets left out of the double bonus early, and that person is arbitrarily singled out by turn order.  Nevertheless, it's an interesting game that I would still play when requested.

Not that this game flew entirely under the radar or has been trashed by anyone - it's got 600 ratings with an average of just over 7, putting it in the top 500 among the thousands of games on this site - but for some reason Santa Fe Rails hasn't garnered a huge following or much hype. Sort of a forgotten game, which is a shame because it's quite good. Alan Moon has designed many train games, including the very popular Ticket ot Ride series and Union Pacific, but for some reason I really enjoy this route-connection game quite a bit more than the others.

This game is opposite of Ticket to Ride with respect to game mechanics. The game itself is very good with some good strategies and a lot of tension in decision making. Money is a little loose, it should have been a little bit tighter or at the end of the game to get some voctory points based on them. A very good game indeed.

Santa Fe Rails is a pretty straightforward train game. You get points for cities you've played to your tableau equal to the city's base value multiplied by the number of different colored tracks connected to the city. There are also bonuses for discovering new cities and getting certain train lines to specific cities. Every turn you pick a card and lay track twice. There are a couple of cards that let you lay extra track and possibly double or negate your bonuses. Additionally there are cards that let you branch a train's path.

Overall I like the game. It is pretty straightforward, so it's a little towards the lighter side but there's some strategy here. I do think that the card draw is perhaps a little too random. Some cities are just naturally better than others.

I think a very simply variant would greatly improve the game. Instead of drawing blindly from the city deck, I'd like to see a card row you can select from. Maybe there are five cards available, the leftmost of which is free. If you select a card to the right, you have to pay a buck to every card you skip and new cards are added to the right of the row and everything slides left to fill gaps. I think that would allow you to avoid getting stuck with horrible cards (or get a little compensation) and you'd have to pay a little extra if you wanted to get a really good card that just came out.

Played twice, once just 2p, once 4p (incomplete). I guess we just didn't find this enough fun for what it is. I think there might not be enough strategy in it, in the sense that most possible actions seem to have about the same expected value - I feel as if it doesn't matter so much what you do. I would be willing to play again, but in the meantime, it's up for trade.

So far, after 1 play, I give it a 7. Will probably go up. It's similar to Union Pacific, which I played before this. It is a nice lightweight "stock" game that plays in a reasonable amount of time. 

The rules may seem a bit muddled the first time around but it is fairly simple.

Santa Fe Rails is a great game, but it does require quite a time commitment: usually about two to three hours. I don't always win, I'll admit, but I usually don't do too bad.

The game board and pieces are of the highest quality; the graphics are excellent. It is a bit expensive, but I have to say it was worth every penny.

Basic game play: you represent a group of real estate investors in the west. Your success depends on the number of towns in which you have an interest and on the number of railroads that connect to that town at the end of the game. In the meantime, you earn money by being the first person to get a railroad to a particular town.

The game play is twofold. First, get railroads to towns before the other players. Second, direct as many railroads as possible to "your" towns. This is done by controlling the railroads' routes, and by drawing cards (towns) on your turns.

All but the smallest towns are represented by two cards, so there is a lot of give and take as players alternately work together and compete to get the railroads where they want them.

I have to say, I learned a lot about the geography of the Midwest, West, and Pacific Northwest as a result of this game. The competive nature of the game is great, too, especially if two couples are playing together. Will it be men against women? Or will it be the Smiths against the Joneses (figuratively speaking)? Probably both!

This is just a great game overall.

Postscript: Currently working on a "quick play" version to combat my only complaint: the time commitment!

Yet another derivative of the train game family that mix a bit of the destination ticket from TTR with the corporation railroad building from UP.  The strategy seems to be in not creating opportunities for the player after you to score a big income, as well as utilizing the special ability cards at the right time.  It may also be prudent to hoard the branch lines due to the fact that there are only three available per major line.  Not exactly deep in terms of the gameplay, but could be used as a stepping stone to introduce people to the more complex titles as you move away from the gateway games.

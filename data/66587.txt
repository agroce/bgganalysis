I have to retract my former rating, which was way higher.

While the game has a nice theme and art and you can pull some awesome combos from the cards, I think that it is harmful to the gameplay that the game mechanisms hamper the gameplay. I don't know if it was intended as a balancing principle that cards get more powerful when you're behind victory points, but what it leads to is awkward gameplay where people are limiting their own progress and try to hinder themselves as much as possible to be virtually behind their enemy and then get access to those boni. While this might be strategically interesting and more complex, it's definitely not very fun to play for me.

Gosu is an interesting game.  You start with 7 cards, play one of those for free, and the rest have to be in a suit you've already played down or they'll cost you two more cards.  You have two activation tokens to use at your discretion before each "Great Battle", and while these can be used to draw cards, many card effects require their use as well.

The card effects are, of course, what make the game.  These effects are triggered when you play an activation token on the card, or when the card is played, or when the card is mutated, or they may provide a constant "rule change" effect to just yourself or all players.  You can remove cards other people have played out through these card effects, flip them over until the end of the next "Great Battle", and make opponents discard cards from their hand.

Since the play area is 3 lines of 5 columns for a total of 15 possible cards (it's not often someone has 15 cards out during the game, though), later in the game you'll want to play cards down but find that you simply don't have any more room for a level 1 card (since you already have 5 out).  This is where the mutate power comes in.  It's kind of expensive, but it lets you do stuff late in the game that you might not ordinarily want to do.  Potentially you may want to use a card effect to destroy one of YOUR cards just so it's less expensive to play out another one from your hand.

Hand management is key in this game, and you almost always feel a dearth of cards.

Gosu is fun to play, and the wheels of your mind are always turning to see how you can possibly use the cards in your hand to best effect.  And once you have a plan in mind, along comes your opponent who forces you to discard a card and now you don't have enough to do what you want to do.  Or you do that to him =)

An excellent combative card-drafting game. Cards are used as resources as in San Juan (discard a certain number of cards to take an action). The spatial element laying the cards in a grid is clever and the artwork is great. Short playing time and lots of good combos make this game a lot of fun. 

Only problem is the dubious marketing decision of making the back of the box multi-lingual, when the game inside is not. I bought my copy in the UK (with English writing on the back) and the cards/rules were in German. Pasting translations over that much text was quite a task! 

*Be sure to double-check which language edition you are buying before leaving the store!*

Enjoyable card game with a few quirks: resolving who has the staring advantage is decidedly odd and too important to the game later. But far worse is this game has my personal most hated device: deck diving. There are too many cards that cause a player to search the discard pile for a choice card (e.g. zombie mutation). Slows the game *way* down and is mechanically sloppy for it. Still, somehow I like it - but not enough to play it. Sold it.

There's a lot of randomness in this one with card draw being the most significant as it is deterministic of the outcome.  That being said, there's enough to do that I'm not too annoyed.  Lots of text to read, lots of crazy combos to build.  I'm cool with that.  If you are too, then you'll probably like this one.  Objectively, not an amazing game.  Makes up for it in fun and will definitely appeal to [url=http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr220b]Johnny-style players[/url].

Fill-your-tableau type of game, with almost every card having a different ability. I love the cards that alter the game-winning conditions. The luck is not so important, due to the abilities of the card that help you play/draw cards that otherwise cannot be played/drawn. The only problem is that it is heavy language dependent (because of all the text on the cards).

Loved it at first, then I noticed some games were won or lost by the initial draw, add to this that with more than 2 players the games tend to be waaaaay to long, with one player playing solo while the others are waiting (also valid for the 2 players game).

Ennek a játéknak a témája nem az én világom, mégis tetszett! Nagyon jó a kártyaleépítés mechanikája, a védett ill. támadható lapok megoldása, a viszonylag könnyen dekódolható információk a(z egyébként nyelvfüggő) kártyákon (kíváncsi vagyok, az ikonos kiadás jobb lesz-e, alapvetően nem csípem a sok ikont a lapokon). Ami nem tetszik, hogy sok lehet a holtidő, a kieggel kombinálva pedig egészen brutális hosszúra is elnyúlhat a játék(a hivatalos idő 3-szorosára). Ennyit nem ér egy kártyajáték számomra. Azért kár a hosszáért, mert egyébként nincs feleslegesen bonyolítva, pont az a szint, amit egy kártyajátéktól elvárnék, de bizonyos kombókkal szinte a végtelenségig lehet húzni egy kört, és ez nem volt szimpi...

This is a very clever design by a veteran MTG player. It has very simple rules, and while there's lots of card interactions and combo, everything is very straightforward (well... at least if you play Magic).
Too bad the version for 4 players drags for way too long. It could get a 6 with two, but increasing the count is harmful...

(Rated on 2p only)

Plus on the interesting army building mechanic and attractiveness of the cards.  I really feel the synergy between each faction, and there are some minor ways to control your fate.  I also like the fact that your hand does not refresh between battles,a nd you really have to manage your cards carefully because of this.

Unfortunately, it's a complete random draw mechanic, meaning your options are at the Whim Of The Gods.  Also, although several cards have a "catch-up" mechanic on them, it is very possible to have a runaway winner, who builds up a lead and that's that.

Too many cards with too many abilities to have fun with on your first play.  I typically dislike that as I don't enjoy playing the same game over and over and over again to bring out the nuance.

Fun tableau builder, and I'm a big fan of this game's emphasis on limited actions. It's very gratifying to extend your available actions through clever card play.

I thought this one sounded fun ... it wasn't. Much too chaotic for my tastes. First game was over almost immediately opponent passed, and I could then play cards, draw cards and got to a 15 grid and won (as I had that gobbo in play). Skillful play on my behalf, maybe, but I suspect luck was the main factor. Next game I had a dire hand but 1 level 1 gobbo so couldn't muligan. It was 3 player, I was out from the start really, never drew anything useful, but my opponents took a while for one to get to 3 vp.

Overall impression - very variable time length, very chaotic, very tactical (you can't go in with a strategy) and I'm not sure it works multiplayer, certainly would never play it with 4. I can see why some like it. I don't, at all. I'd rather play pre-constructed MtG, and if I want MtG with a bit of chaos then I'll play Planechase which IS fun.

Decent game but wasn't a good match for my wife.  You must play with the tournament drafting rule to select your starting hand IMO.  Otherwise you can get stuck with a totally unworkable hand and be in for a miserable experience.

A very odd little game (also very overpriced at full retail). Clever, but I'm inclined to say that you just don't have enough control over card draw and turnover for this to be very satisfying.

RATING: 6
The tension in this game is how to build an army when there is no draw card phase and you'll be losing cards by playing, paying them to play other cards, and having your opponent force you to discard cards.

It's an interesting effort.

Unfortunately, only the third victory wins you the game, and if you lose the first two rounds, you should mop the floor with the opponent in the last three because of the broken catch-up mechanic.

This is actually a decent game, at least I find it better than most other ”take that”/”combat” card games. I’ve only tried it with 2, but that is by far the best number according to BGG, and I can see why.
The game is actually quite simple, but does a splendid job of complicating the rules due to the way the rulebook is structured and explained (by a first person goblin character…) You play until somebody has 3 VP and then that person wins. You mainly get a VP from winning the battle that takes place each round; once everybody has passed (although there are a few other cards that let you get a VP in some other way, but don’t count on that) you total the number of strength of each player; highest wins. On your turn you can either play a goblin, mutate a goblin, activate a special ability of a goblin or draw some cards – but turns go by very quickly, and I like that you rarely get to draw new cards, so hand management becomes crucial.

I like the 5 different factions which feel very unique, but the trapper-faction seems, at least to me, much cooler and has better (meaner!) abilities than the rest. The fire faction also has some mean abilities, but even the non-mean abilities of the other factions can be very important. However, due to the mechanics of the game, you are probably focusing on 2-3 factions as it’s expensive to go for more. But then you can always mutate a few cards and change your setup (and you do want to mutate some of your cards as a lot of the cards only have a special ability once they enter the game and not an ongoing ability).
The game feels somewhat tense as you never know what your opponent is going to do; which goblin he fields can have an impact on your choice as well.

My first couple of games went off in very different directions; the first game took 45 minutes (granted it was a learning game) and ended 3-3, while the second took 10-15 minutes and ended 3-0… And in this second game my opponent never really stood a chance as he didn’t draw a lot of cards of the same faction, and he drew a lot of level 3 goblins and almost no level 2, so, yes, there is definitely some luck of the draw which can be game-deciding (I also don’t like that you can get lucky and draw a lot of level 3 cards that fits your strategy perfectly), but it is most likely a rare occasion. 
A solid game that I can see myself playing from time to time if it really does only take 20 minutes with 2, but if I’m looking for a combat oriented card game I would still rather play Summoner Wars even if that takes twice as long.

I like the whole idea of this game. I like the draft and deciding what cards to play and the triggered effects that happen. The card draw is random and some cards seem a little too powerful.

Woa. This is a card game with a very different feel. A card tableau, with multiple "magic the gathering" like abilities, no card draws between battles... it has a very different pace than most card games. It's also pretty wild and chaotic.

The two player game was very intriguing, and I'd like to try this some more. But four players? Forget it. In GOSU, you sometimes have to pass on a turn and bow out early to "live and fight another day." With four players, though, you can keep getting pounded. It's hard to plan with that many players at the table.

I'm intrigued enough to try this some more, but I'll want to keep the player count down.

Update: Well, after staring at this on the shelf a couple of times and feeling a tepid reaction, I decided to trade this away in a math trade. My dislike of playing this with four players and trying to read everyone's cards was probably its downfall.

I have to admit, I was a bit scared to give this one a try. I bought the game because of an article in Bruno Faidutti's Ideal Game Library that rose my interest. After reading the rules, I was quite confident that I would like this one. But then I read some comments which described this game as chaotic and uncontrollable. Did i fall for the hype again?

After playing this game five times now, I can not see where this complaints come from. Okay, this one is a card game, so there is some luck of the draw. But all in all it is not anymore chaotic than Warhammer Invasion. Maybe you just have to like this kind of game to enjoy it. Without a special order, here is what I think about this game:

* Really tough hand management: You don't draw new cards unless you play goblins that allow you to do so. If you have no more cards in your hand, you have to pass while your opponent may be able to build a huge army. So a good deal of your turn you are not only thinking about ways to mess with your opponent, but you also try to build a card drawing engine.

* Multiple layers: Gosu offers quite a few layers of strategy. Of course there are the obvious ones: How do I built a good combo with the cards I have in my hand? Apart from this, you also have to think about the way you build your army. Do you go for a lot of Level 1 and 2 Goblins or do you try to secure your cards by not leaving them free. Do I built this Level 3 Goblin to get some points down for the big battle or does his ability give my opponent an advantage. How can I built a good resource engine? Did I already  mention all the combos in the card that you can discover? But in the end it's all about the strength of your army in the big battle. So don't get too obsessed with all the other stuff. It's really fun to balance all this things.

* Discard pile is an active part of the game: Because of the goblins that allow you to draw cards from the discard play and the Zombie Mutation, you even pay attention to what the other players discard. This is a nice addition.

* I have only played the two player game thus far, so I can't say anything about the quality of this game with  three and four players.

* Gosu sure is a little slower than your typical card game. It reminds me of Warhammer Invasion in that you really have to think about which card you want to play next. There are some tough decisions to make and so it can take some time until it is your turn again. This is not so bad in a two player game, but it could become a problem with more people at the table.

Gosu is another hand management card game along the line of Race For the Galaxy, with the cards being used as currency to pay for placement of cards as well as to "upgrade" them later using mutations. 

I am hesitant to rate this game at this point in time simply because I have only played it once, with four players, and it seems that this sort of game that you need to play quite a bit to be able to truly assess. That being said, there currently seems to be not enough going on to recommend it over Race For the Galaxy or Innovation. So I am willing to play it again, but am not particularly eager to do so.

RATING: 5
Players recruit Goblins from five tribes to try and defeat your opponent.  Interesting game where you take turns taking an action, such as playing a card, activating a card, and so on.  Cards are played onto a 5 by 3 level grid, possibly incurring a cost in further cards from your hand.  Cards can then be activated to trigger their ability (or their ability may be triggered simply by playing it).  Abilities attack your opponent, or help yourself.  Cards can be mutated (replaced), and stronger level 2 or 3 cards can be played too.  When both players have passed, the grids are compared and a victory chit is awarded to the most VP's in their grid.  First to three chits wins the game.  Very interesting, and would probably get quite deep as you get more familiar with the cards and combinations.  The fact that you get no new cards to draw, unless your card abilities grant it, means you must tread very carefully, and have a card drawing engine in place.  Well worth a look.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I really like the artwork and style of this game, as well as the unique gameplay.  I really enjoy figuring out the interesting interactions between the cards.  However after my first few plays, the one issue I noticed is the sometimes lengthy time a turn takes, caused by the need for heavy analysis of cards in the discard, cards in play under your opponent's control, and cards in your hand.  Hopefully further plays will allow the game to be learned well enough that this issue will be reduced or eliminated.  I'll also be trying to sit side by side instead of across the table so that it is easier to read the opponent's cards in play. If the slow playing time goes down my rating will go up.

So I've now played this 4 times and have won the last 3 games (my wife won our 1st game of it).  Other than the 1st game we've used the drafting 'variant' in all games and I definitely consider this to be the only real way to play.

The game is very interesting and I'm still not even close to internalising all of the cards yet as there are so many different cards each with their own effects.  This is compounded by the fact that all of the lvl 2 and 3 gobans are unique, and don't get me started on all of the potential interactions of the different powers! However I think that it will really flow when I've got that down.

There seems to be a lot of 'swing' in the game.  Some rounds you'll not be able to do much more than burn your activation tokens for 3 cards, although that seems to be fairly rare.  Other rounds you'll end up doing a ridiculous amount, playing cards, mutating cards, using activated abilities, etc.

In the end every game that I've played has been very tight with all of the players poised for a possible victory on the final round and in pretty much every game the player who was down at the end of the 1st round or two has gone on to win it.  To the extent that I wonder if the catch up is maybe a shade too powerful, although given other people's complaints that if you drop behind you can't catch up I suspect not.  Not that I have seen any evidence of this runaway leader (or fall away loser I guess) problem.

I still feel the same way as I did in the review but I would add that in the hindrances of this game the catchup mechanism is often too good.  I guess it results in closer games but losing to win feels too gamey to me.  After playing Gosu 2, I've implemented some of it's concepts into the original game.  Here are the changes:

-With newbies, instead of drafting, we draw 10 and simultaneously choose 7, discarding the other 3. This is a Gosu 2 rule. With experienced players, I'll still draft as per the original rules though.

-After a player passes opponents only get 3 turns until the Great Battle happens. Any extra turns opponents get through card effects do not go against the 3 turn limit. This is a Gosu 2 rule. The original Gosu rules allowed for unlimited turns and the revised rules allowed for 10 extra turns. 3 adds a nice tension to the rounds.

-When playing cards/activating a goblin, abilities are never modified by what's in the parenthesis. This is my own made up rule that just makes the game a lot better and not devolving into a losing to win mentality. I also think it also better balances some of the goblins.

-After a Great Battle, each player draws up to 7 cards minus the number of VP they have. This is a Gosu 2 rule. This works better as a catch-up mechanism as it's not so overwhelmingly good.

With these implementations, I actually like the original Gosu more than Gosu 2. If you have a phobia of house rules, Gosu 2 is a pretty decent game that you should check out.

Was wary of this game, based on some of the early reviews, but I was able to play some games online with Vassal. Was still wary, but then we tried the draft format. It's night and day!! I ordered after playing 3 games with the draft format, and it's quickly risen to the top of my list of recent favorite games. Moving from a 10 to an 8, based on plays with more than 2 players. Play this 2 player and 2 player only!

Great game!  Tight hand management, tableau building and card morphing.  Love it!  It gets a little extra love because it's tableau building game that's simpler than Race or Innovation so I can play it with a broader group of people.  Be wary of playing with new players in a game with more than two.  After playing a bit I'm a little concerned about blowout wins.  Prefer to play with the draft when playing with experienced players.

I like a lot of things about GOSU, but it's always hit-or-miss with me. Sometimes things just seem to click and I do well enough to really enjoy the game. Other times it seems like I'm stuck drawing nearly useless cards while my existing army is getting trampled. There is a lot of luck in the game, but it can be fun despite it. Some of the rules are just counter intuitive enough that I have to re-read the entire rulebook every time we play, which prevents this from hitting the table very often.

Love the art and theme. The rulebook is great.

The gameplay is ok. It's fun for a 20 minute filler. Much more direct player interaction than Race for the Galaxy or Dominion. (Which are two TOTALLY distinct games mind you!) 

I feel like there are obvious choices you MUST make based on your card draw though. (Like some options are just out of your hand because there isn't anything else you COULD do.) Someone could also get an amazingly lucky card draw and just dominate the game. There is that luck factor...but the game is short enough that you can press your luck again in the next round...and playing more than 1 game is easy and enjoyable.

More luck than strategy. Both players draw from the same common deck without any choice as to what cards they receive. Without a deckbuilding mechanic (i.e. dominion, thunderstone, resident evil, etc) and choice of cards it's more a matter of drawing cards that play well together. Certainly there is some strategy in what cards you play, but no amount of strategy can correct drawinga bad hand of cards that don't play well together or aren't useful for the situation.

While of course being different than I was reminded of Fairytale when playing this.

There is considerable down time for the first player who passes until all others pass as well. The ability text on the cards is written in tiny letters which doesn't add to the ergonomy. The gameplay itself is ok. I was'nt impressed but it wasn't bad either.

This might have been a quick and (mildly) fun game, but it is slowed down by lots of reading. Every card has some power text and most cards are unique. Of course, the text is in tiny font and there is the aggravating mechanic of choosing a card from the discard pile.

The rules of building your army are somewhat interesting with the clan requirements, but also very dependent on luck of the draw. It is further spoiled by how easily a card can be nullified or eliminated. What makes this even worse is that all these powers target a single opponent of the player's choice. I have only played with one other player, but I imagine how chaotic it will be with more.

The expansion allows playing without the annoying dark goblins, but it adds more luck with the banner bearer units, which can make a huge difference to have in your starting hand.

All in all, the game is not totally bad, but definitely not worth the effort.

Rating after 10+ games,

There is something to like about this game for sure. The rules for goblin placement are interesting and the mutation is a really neat idea. While the theme is pretty basic, the actual card art is of good quality. 

But... The game is way too chaotic to produce strategic play. Just a big take-that festival (at least as a two-player game, but I figure more players just add politics and not dynamics to this game). Can be fun in a way, like UNO card game, if you just play it and see what happens. But don't expect any serious strategic game, just a way to pass time.

Edit: Three player game also tried. Didn't improve the feelings towards this game. This game has had it's fair change, it's just not interesting enough for me as it is, to get much more play.

It's way more interactive than RftG and much more fun than Dominion.

RFTG + MTG?  Looks more like Magic possibly, could be interesting at any rate and I'm a sucker for card games...

Edit - apparently too random to play with more than two similiar to Innovation, and in more than just that way too. Sounds more tactical too, maybe I should stick to RFTG

I've played a few 2P and once 3P.  Our 3P game felt like it would never end due to players always having cards in hand.  Based upon feedback of others, our experience wasn't uncommon.  The game has significant end game issues.  As a result, the game has the potential to never end.

With that said, I've yet to have a 2P game drag on forever.  Basically, this is a very enjoyable 2P game (my rating 7), but a lousy 3P game (my rating 2).

To be perfectly honest, I don’t remember much about the game. I do remember that the game had lots of luck AND that it is abysmally slow with 4 players. Its sweet spot is two players. The art is nice and this should be right up to my alley. I will give it another chance before I sell my copy of the game.

Love the theme.

I finally played the game again! I was ready to sell it but I enjoyed the game. It is true the game is for two players only, with more the luck factor and the downtime go up. Even with two players there is a lot of luck involved in it but it seems there a are a lot of ways to mitigate it.

The rules are easy to explain and the game manual does a good (and fun) job of explain them, however what to do isn’t apparent, so it seems GOSU has some depth I would like to explore.

I love the art, I love that there are almost no repeat cards and I like the gameplay. After the setup, you don’t draw new cards unless you spent a token or a Goblin allows you. This allows for very tense games and makes hand management the most important thing.
 
Bottom line. I would like to play GOSU more times so it is a keeper in my game collection (for now).

I think it's OK. 

It's got a lot that fuels CCG games and LCG games (Magic, Warhammer, etc), but it's not collectible or blind buy. With these type of games, you try to build up and fire off combinations of special powers. Special powers and combinations are the heart of these games and form your engine. It makes learning the game slower as you have to read the cards, but you start to get used to it and repeated plays will go quicker and you'll see how cards tie together quicker. If you play again that is.

Gosu's got a nice level build up aspect that I really appreciated, but in the game I played, I didn't draw great cards and was kind of hosed most of the game. 

It was frustrating, but that's just the game...next time I may have rocked the house.

Like all of these games, it's a niche thing. You like the special powers, learning the cards, dealing with bad draws or you don't.

It hits the midden point for me. I liked it OK, liked the art, the game play was OK...and would play again. It didn't blow my skirt up, but it didn't suck either.

Now this is good. Pretty easy to learn as the rules are very simple. The way that cards interact is not so simple and once you start to see a few combos that's when the evilness, giggling and a little bit of AP can kick in. Keeping track of your opponents cards is important and not so easy as the text is pretty small but this game is great, beautiful to look at and should be in your cupboard ready to hit the table at any time. Excellent.

RATING: 6
I bought Gosu at Essen '10, because of the cool artwork, my interest in competitive cardgames, and because of the hype. Unfortunately, the game doesn't seem to work for me. Its mechanics are very interesting, in that you have to discard cards in order to play cards, and it's a definate challenge to find the right combinations to outlast and outwit your opponent. But it seems really repetitive. Maybe because of the limited set of cards. Whatever it is, I'm not very motivated to play it again because there are better cardgames that seem more replayable.

RATING: 8
I didn't have any interest in Gosu on its release. It was forced on me when it was sold off ridiculously cheap in a bundle with the Kamakor expansion. So I ended up with a goblin-themed combo-building game. Each characteristic alone normally is enough to make me wary.
Gosu nonetheless passed the play test. I enjoyed my first play of this tableau builder. Trying to build something useful from the dealt cards is an interesting enough task. There's plenty of combos to be discovered. It helped that it was with two players only. This way, the targetted attacks aren't bothering and the downtime trap of unexperienced players repeatedly sifting through the discard pile or other players' tableaus isn't too deep. Still, 75 unique cards make learning this game a challenge and require a lot of reading until the cards are better known.
This is where Gosu falls short. A dedicated group and much effort would be needed to reach a satisfying level of play. Until then, players will stumble through their turns slowly. Gosu's potential remains locked. Race for the Galaxy had a similar challenge. An excellent AI helped me to climb the learning curve high enough. Also, gameplay is so great once you're up there that enough other players are available. Three years after its release it's safe to say that Gosu didn't have enough impact to overcome the hurdle any card-driven tableau builder faces. RFTG or the newer Seasons do the same thing better leaving no room at the table for Gosu which otherwise is a perfectly workable but just ok game.

Still undecided. I had a very nice gaming session with 4 players in Essen. But I thought this game would rock as a 2 player and after the play I'm not so sure even more. Problem with 4 players is the playing time, which exceeds one hour. Gosu is cool, but maybe not quick enough. On the other hand, the strong "catch the leader" effects bring a lot of tension.

GOSU plays like a hybrid of Race for the Galaxy and Magic: The Gathering with each player trying to recruit an army of goblins made up of soldiers, heroes, magicians, and other classes – then swing it into action against the other players. Five clans of goblins are represented on the game cards, with goblins in one of three ranks. To build an army, a player must first recruit level I goblins, then build on those goblins with level II and finally level III. Those higher level goblins can be played only if a lower level goblin is of the same clan, and since goblins of the same clan have similar abilities or powers that mesh well, players tend to specialize in who they recruit to their ranks.

Building a personal Goblin army and crushing on your opponents.  The game says it plays quickly.  However, all of the cards have a unique play text which creates a lot of down time due to reading the play text on the cards.  New players have to read their cards and your cards to find out what they can and can't do.  This is a time vacuum when you play.

Great rulebook (very clear; with a dose of fun that is non gratuitous: fun is used as a style, with useful information introduced through fun).  A small reference page would be nice, but the game is simple enough that I didn't miss it too much.

Simple rules.

The theme has some "holes": nobody dies during the Great Battles (i.e. each time someone earns a victory point).

I like how we have to make do with the remaining cards in hands and current tableau, between rounds. This is a different mechanism than in many games.

When playing GOSU, I miss Magic's more strategic card play (where cards typically stay longer, where they have longer effects—like Enchantments), and more thematic cards. Thus, we only have *creatures*, in Gosu, and their power is often a one-shot, simple, mostly non-thematic power.

I would also play Race for the Galaxy anytime over this game, for its more involved play, for its much larger depth.

The game might be good. But the rulebook was printed back to front with different languages mingled together.

It's literally the worst rulebook I have ever owned for any game ever.

Because it isn't super easy to reference how to even play the game, it makes it hard to remember exactly what does what, which in turn makes it a chore to teach. I appreciate there are online sources but I'd rather just play a better written game, where I can reference on the fly if needed.

This game is brilliant ! So much in this deck of cards, especially the hand management is very unique I haven never seen in a card game oof this style before. Of course you need some luck of the draw now and then, but that's expected from a card game. Big comebacks are absolutely possible with the nice catch-up system. All abilities feel good, and I love the powers of the level III ones, very nice flavor to the game. I want to play this a lot more.
The art is fantastic, I really love the colors of the clans too.

Only played as 2 player so far, which I imagine is the best way to play it.

Also I think GOSU + Kamakor is superior to GOSU 2 : Tactics.

Bought the special GOSU sleeves just because they are plain awesome !

This game fell a bit flat for me. Fiance loves it. I think the biggest problem I have is the length. It ends up taking a lot longer than it should.

Gosu is about building the most valuable tableau. After everyone passes for the round tableaus are evaluated (quite easily) and the winner gets a vp. Win 3 vps and win the game.

There are quite a few nods to MtG here. I'm a huge goblin fan from my Magic days so this certainly doesn't hurt my enthusiasm about the game.

There is room for both long term strategy and short term tactics amid the chaos that this game is. I also like to say "what goes around comes around" as it always seems to even out luck-wise in the long run.

Good, tempered, hand management, and clever use of synergy rule the day.

RATING: 8
Fun 2p game. 3p tends to drag out longer than they should, and so I'll stick with 2p games from here on out.

It does require a couple games to get the card text down....or at least the first couple games will be much longer as you are struggling to read and think about all the different cards.

But even with the learning curve, I think the game is well worth it.

Would love to have an AI for this game.  I wonder if Keldon is busy?  

Will try to re-rate after 20-30 games.

Games with many, many different cards that all have a lot of rules text make me afraid of two things, namely that a) the designers do not care overmuch about new players having fun right away and b) that the game system by itself can not sustain interest without a heap of individual exceptions. Gosu absolutely fulfills the first of these fears, which is a shame since I’m not sure about the second one, as both the ordering of your goblin army and the dynamic of build-up rounds ending in a contest of your hordes has potential.

Good illustrations and a couple of fun unit abilities could have salvaged this, nevertheless, but the final nail in the coffin is the implementation of one of my pet hates not just as a one-off ability, but as a regular feature of quite a lot of shadow goblins: look through the whole discard pile for a card. As I’ve mentioned before, each and everyone of those cards has its one rules text, and the other players just sit and wait while your doing this. I see the possibility that quite a bit of these problems will decrease with more experience, but I don’t see why I should invest the effort.

If you’re interest in this lacklustre affair was kindled by comparisons with Race for the Galaxy, do yourself a big, big favor and try before you buy.

As a friend pointed out, Gosu has great depth with limited width, which makes it quick to learn and play, but means there's a lot packed into every game.

The hand management aspect and the mutation mechanic are brilliant, and the way the level IIIs introduce chaos into the game is interesting. Always wanting more tokens and more cards is pleasurably painful, and finding ways to overcome those limitations is satisfying. I love the card art, the abilities, and the overall feel, as well.

This scratches a lot of the CCG itch for me. It's a fun game, and it's packed with strategy, tactics, and things to learn. The combo potential, and the game knowledge required to play well in its ever-shifting landscape, mean that this one could hit the table for years without getting dull.

I've played 2p with tournament rules (draft the first hand, 10-turn post-pass limit) and with the limit but sans drafting. It's much better with drafting.

All of that said, I found myself content to leave it on the shelf for long stretches, and in this case that meant it was time to sell it.

I keep saying that I just love piling up goblins and don't care about winning; the game is fairly random after all, especially in multiplayer. That said, I seem to win every time...

I haven't tried the expansion much but the basic 5 tribes combined with the drafting start from the expansion seem to work well. I guess the crux is the trade-off between amassing an army and leaving some outs for rebuilding your hand as resources are very limited.

From what I have seen, I am not interested in the new GOSU 2.

Edit: After a few more plays I downgrade it to 8.5. Compared to Warhammer Invasion it feels a bit shallow, but is still highly suitable as a fast paced, confrontational card game.

Pretty random, and with a rich gets richer mechanism; while there are cards that reward a player who is behind, if you don't draw the right cards, you can be completely locked out of the game.  Also, play time is very variable.  First game lasted about 10 minutes, second game was closer to an hour.  With lots of downtime.  Search the graveyard cards aren't fun for the other players when the graveyard is full, and most cards are different...

As a 2 player game, I'd rate it 6-7; with more than two players, around a 5.

Sometimes it's brilliant, but more often it winds up frustrating. The luck of the card draw is a BIG deal in this game. 

Kamakor is included for trade.

Interesting... fast, tense, and unpredictable. Neat and unobtrusive catch-up mechanisms. Card powers seem to vary quite a bit in usefulness, but thematically, it makes sense – the five clans are supposed to be different, after all (and besides, balance in games is overrated).

Must play more!

A card game where you build an army of goblins in a 3x5 grid in front of you.  Five different families of goblins, each one having unique special abilities they can use, are made up of three different ranks of goblins.  

There are rules dictating how and when certain ranks of goblins can come out.  When goblins come out they can trigger certain abilities, sometimes they create pretty cool combos that are usually interesting to watch develop.  

Sometimes the game can get lopsided, however the game can be played pretty quickly which helps even out that problem.  The artwork is beautiful and it is a joy to play when both sides are even.

First impression (4 players): First of all this IS NOT for 4 players. The game just dragged on forever when there were combos that enabled more cards to be gained/played. Perhaps we played too nicely but anyway that element is still there even with more aggressive play.

The basic idea is nice but game feels too chaotic and perhaps even a bit too luck driven.

Not easy to play the first time (lot of combinations) but keep getting better and better with more plays. Dunno if I will have the same addiction as Race for the Galaxy, but enjoyed several plays in the row. Rating may rise with more plays (and with the final product). For now, around 50 games on a home-made prototype.

RATING: 7
The rules are very simple. The actual action is based completely on card powers. There are some ambiguities in the card powers, though, as you'd expect from a French game.

Even though there are lots of cards helping either everyone or the players with the least points, catching up can sometimes be very difficult in a two player game. In this regard, the game is a lot more balanced with four players but the downside is that the playing time gets excruciatingly long. With two players, the game plays very quickly.

The cards are a bit thin, and black, so sleeves might be worth using. There's one usability issue with the layout: All powers activating upon mutation or destruction should have been clearly marked, like the permanent powers already are. Now they have marked only the Zombie Mutation cards, which is silly since those are all black cards anyway.

Comes in a Carcassonne expansion box with no insert.

The closest card based board game to magic so far.  Playing with the drafting variant is a must.  The game is well themed and the tactical decisions are quite fun.  There is certainly a lot of strategy to giving up some early points to get the advantages of losing.  Hope to get a bunch more plays of this in, sort of like race, with some people who know what they are doing.  This game has tons of potential.  Like race, I love that it can be played very quickly.

A seemingly fairly random game of hoping to draw cards in the same colours across all 3 levels so you can whip them out onto your tableau for cheap, and then use the highest level effects for maximum advantage. Once everyone can no longer play, whoever has the biggest baddest collection of cards in their tableau wins a battle (win 3 and you win the game). And then just carry on, with the other players using card effects to whittle you down to size. It seemed quickish to start, but then started dragging as effect after effect came to bear, with more and more cards in hand and therefore to be played. The theme was funnish though. Maybe playing simply to 2 VPs is enough and turn it into more of a filler, which seems in keeping with the randomness of whether you draw high level cards in the colours you've invested in or not - a point which seemed pretty game-determining.

Okay. Pretend you're a Goblin fighting another Goblin, and you're hitting each other in the head and gut with maces and explosives, back and forth. Now, pretend you're not just a Goblin, but an army of Goblins, fighting other armies of Goblins. If you were to put this into a tableau-building swingy card game, it might feel like GOSU!!!

Learning curve in learning, tactics, and strategy. I found this counter-intuitive for me, but from what I understand, if I give it enough time, things begin to click. Unfortunately for me, I've got too many other tableau-builders which I love that I won't be able to give enough time to this one for me to do it justice.

Very appealing first experience. There is a lot to be done and very interesting combos to be discovered. Needs a few more plays for definite rating.

Found some very nice combos with last play. It was great fun but still, there was some signifficant downtime when two players passed and the third started morphing all his cards... I suppose that's a path to go. was a good learning game. Will need more plays still.

RATING: 6
Based on one play: A theme driven card game, where you lay down cards in front of you based on different Goblin clans. Each card has an effect and based on the cards level, the effects get stronger. To play a stronger card, you must have one of the same clan and then place the stronger one on top, which has better effects and gives more points. you manage your cards in order to get the most on the table, when no one can play, the turn ends. The theme will appeal to a younger crowd and those who enjoy Magic or Munchkin. The game play is fairly basic with the usual, best combo wins. A nice variant from playing those other games over and over, but notreally for me.

Playtime: ~15 minutes per player

Comment: You're a goblin commander building up a goblin army of hodgepodge troops. You start with only 7 cards and either through various card abilites or activation tokens do you get more cards. I really like the artwork on the game and the gameplay is solid albeit forgettable. I'll only play with the tournament rules as I think the rules from just the regular version can be broken. Sitting around after passing while your opponent destroys your stuff sucks. This game can also be lucky with card draw, but I think an experienced player will win most of the time.

Optimal Player Count: 2 >>> 3 >>>>> 4
I think 2 is optimal, but it plays okay with the other player counts. 4 becomes quite chaotic however.

Extras: Cards are sleeved in Mayday sleeves and are starting to stick together. I really need to get a couple packs of FFG sleeves. Also, box is tossed and it's contained within a large deck box holder.

Fun card combo playing game with emphasis on spatial positioning and colors of the cards. Which does not mean that the cards are plain and simple.

GOSU- which stands for Goblins Over Statistical Underwear! No not really, but the graphics are nice! So the flavour of the game revolves along a battle amongst Goblin clans where you recruit (read-pulled from the deck) many factions to attack your opponent. The more of one faction you have the more powerful goblins you can put out of that faction. So if you take away the theme your trying to trump your opponent with some special abilities. This works adequately well, however it is a bit pants (for Americans pants is slang for crap and also means underwear) down at its base. Not everyone is a fan of Goblins, I suspect only teenagers and minors are really the fans of this theme. I'm not satisfied with this review even though it covers all basis, same as this game.

Didn't make the cut, because Goblins don't rulez the roost! Better then a zombie theme though. ZZZZZZZZZZZ

Interesting take on a card game. You do not get any new cards into your hand between every play! You need to use card effects or the tokens to get more cards in hand. Totally different this way.

Essen '10. First play: my husband forgot that he could get new cards by using the two activation tokens, so I got an easy win. Good game, the different colors of goblins have different strengths, which is nice. It should play quite quickly once we figure out all the cards a bit better, now there was quite a bit of looking up, and asking what they did again.  

Played several more times, I enjoy this a lot 2 player, not sure about the 3 player game, and haven't tried 4 player (yet).

Update: after playing many more times, the depth of the game rises. A few of the cards appeared too powerful but after additional plays, the counter moves become apparent. It is very similar to Gosu Tactics which plays quicker and is more streamlined however, I believe the original game has greater depth. Gosu is much less forgiving than Gosu Tactics.

A combination of Magic and Spellfire. The game works well and satisfies that Magic urge without being too costly. I find it much more entertaining than Dominion as there is real player interaction. The game can be a bit fiddly and a few of the cards seem overpowered.  

All of this has been rectified in Gosu Tactics (Gosu 2).

This game is great fun, but suffers from two pretty big problems:
1.) A lot of the mechanisms are counter-intuitive. Often, you want to get behind early so all of your cards get supercharged, you don't refresh your hand between rounds, and so forth.
2.) At some point the complexity of options available grinds the game to a halt. The biggest offender is the death mutation (or whatever it's called that lets you mutate from the discard pile). The discard can--and will--get up to 50+ cards, and having literally all of those available to choose from as an option is awful in the sense of playing the game in a reasonable amount of time.

RATING: 6
Another recent card game that takes inspiration from the recent deck-building post-Magic trend. The theme does not do much for me, I have never been a fan of the 'Silly Greenskins' approach that has been made popular by GW and this is no exception. I am more of a Tolkien-Orc kind of guy. Anyhow, theme aside (the artwork is not that bad), the game is pretty decent, but just like many cardgames of this type, it feels a tad solitaire. Most of the time, people are just pondering over their own card display and figuring out what to do next, occasionally influencing the other players' game to a limited degree. It is this lack of interactivity that my biggest complain would be, I can see how you might almost be able to play this solitaire as the majority of the rules are concerned with the efficiency of your army structure than playing off your opponents' game. Also, the game just takes too long, I would have been happy to play this game for half the length I had to when I sat down and played it for the first time and that is not a good sign. So, shorten it and maybe add some Interaction and I am up for it.

Underrated gem. I love all the different goblins and all of the unique abilities that can swing the game. The system for building your army is innovative, and the ability to mutate the goblins to chain effects is brilliantly simple.

My only problem with GOSU is that it can get a bit chaotic and lengthy with more than 2 players. It makes for a fantastic 2-player game, but I tend to play with bigger groups.

RATING: 5
Great production values, straight forward rules, nice limitation (5x3 grid, suits, layers) and the overload on every-single-card having a specific effect is downplayed by the logic of the suits and the fact that, at the end of the day, you only higher values than the opponent to score VPs.

Still, luck of the draw and take that game play is not my favorite. Probably like it more than Summoner Wars but less than Neuroshima Hex. Maybe I like it as much as NH?

To be fair, I now don't think the game is particularly good - some of the mechanics are a little clunky, and I do wonder if it is a bit too luck-based. But I do also think it's potentially quite interesting, and I like the art on the cards. I'm not desperate to play again, but think it might perhaps be worth a few more plays at some point. But I don't expect that to happen.

Cards are your most precious resource in Gosu. In two player, they can be hard to come by unless you're careful. In multiplayer, they are perhaps too easy to come by.

Sehr gutes und innovatives Kartenspiel für max. drei Spieler (bei vieren wird es m.E. sofort unspielbar). Jeder Spiel baut eine Armee von Goblins unterschiedlicher Stämme vor sich auf; fast jeder Goblin hat eine Spezialfähigkeit, die sich auf das jeweilige Rundenende ("Great Battle" = simpler Abgleich der Punktwerte der ausgelegten Goblins) nachhaltig auswirkt. Die vielen Spezialfähigkeiten ziehen ein Spiel zu viert sehr in die Länge.

Bought on a whim because it reminded me of Summoner Wars, a game that I should like because it has a lot of elements I typically enjoy but that I just haven't clicked with. Looking at this, it occurred to me that maybe the tactical movement element bothered me in SW and, seeing as this lacks that, maybe it would be a better fit. Both have units with various abilities, in both you pay for bringing cards in to play with other cards, and formation or placement matters.

First impressions after a couple of games: I got this on a whim because I thought it might be more to my tastes than Summoner Wars. specifically, I thought that cutting the tactical movement might be for the better. The simplicity of the rules is attractive, but it's no simpler than SW. Neither is the gameplay more imaginable. A fight without casualties? c'mon. It does have a simple economy akin to ccg-esque games like SW. Then again the same mechanic is found in san juan, which is only a little tamer than Gosu. There is more interaction here, but less than in say Innovation. I'll give this a few more spins to sink in, but maybe I should take a look Tooth & Nail or Omen. Really, Babel and Netrunner could fill that craving for an interactive card game better as well...

I finally traded this away and am looking elsewhere for my two-player games. This just didn't have the interaction I like. I'm still lost as to why I haven't had the hots for Summoner Wars. I was interested in GOSU because it had many elements SW has but lacked te tactical movement. Unfortunately, it may lack too many elements, like a combat system.

Visual Appeal: (5)
This game looks great. The art is a really new take on goblins apart from the standard fantasy tropes. I love that there is art inside the box! The game takes no setup beside shuffling, and so it has a very minimal look and feel on the table.

Components: (4)
The card quality is not the best but it is acceptable. I sleeved them after a few plays because I noticed some light wear at the edges. Tokens are not the most essential thing in the game, but they are there and they are durable. I wish the box, beautiful as it is, had some sort of divider to keep the cards from clunking around inside.  

Theme: (3)
The idea of building a goblin army is really cool. There isn't a whole lot of theme other than an almost MtG-esque color/action bias. White goblins draw cards, red goblins do direct damage etc. At least it isn't a Rock-Paper-Scissors type of interaction. Also, it is cool to have control over customizing your army, but over diversification is costly.

Learning: (2)
This game is fairly easy to teach. New players just need to know when they can and can not play a card, what the numbers on the card mean, and how to manage the hand when there's no guaranteed card draw. That being said, there are a lot of things that don't make sense at all until you see it happen and it does take a few plays to get a handle on the color archetypes and hand management. The first few games can be frustrating as a result.

Gameplay: (3)
I like the fact that there are a lot of angles that you can attack your opponent if you want to. It balances out some of the powerful tier 3 goblins and allows you to catch up (somewhat) when you are behind. I think if one player just whiffs on card draw, there can be a run-away leader. The only way to solve that though is to play specific goblins that draw more cards or use the very inefficient action of trading your tokens in for cards. The game seems to be very high risk/high reward in this sense. If you don't get some card draw, you can get powerful attacks to slow your opponent, but you might run out of steam quickly.  

Overall Fun: (2)
I am willing to play this game 2 player only. I have tried with 3 and 4 players both Free-for-all and in teams. They just take way too long for this type of game. As 2 player games go, this one is just OK. When one player is in a well-established position, it is really easy for them to just smash the other player repeatedly without fear of immediate reprise. This can be demoralizing and just plain awful.

A game of overwhelming choice. This is a Tableau building game in which each player has 15 slots to play cards to, most cards have some sort of effect on gameplay. With this, in even just a 2p game, you might have to manage in a typical game situation the effects of 15-20 cards happening simultaneously. On top of this, there is a mechanism called "mutation", which lets you exchange the mutating goblin for a goblin in the discard pile. If you thought it was hard to figure out which of the 5 cards in your hand to play was wait until you're looking at a 30 card discard pile.

If complicated game states appeal to you, you'll love this game, but I just don't find that any fun.

Gosu is all about card advantage and card economy. Chaining card draw is a huge part of the game. There are many cool abilities, and I like trying to figure out the best use of the cards I have available. 

The art is incredible. 

The biggest issue I have with the game is that I have other 2 player games I like more, and you really need to play this one a lot to get the most out of it. Without a good knowledge of the card distribution and a firm grasp of the strategies, plays can end up being a bit rough.

This is kind of the card game that I really like.  It is really strong on tactical game play, where players have to be really flexible and figure out what the best play for them would be each turn.  The tension of not wanting to pass to early, but not wanting to over extend is a good one.  I think this is a game that will get a lot of play in the future.  The only downside is the theme is kind of silly, but the awesome art work makes up for it.

RATING: 7
Pretty cool card game where you enlist goblins from different factions in your army.  I like how you only freely draw the initial 7 cards and any card draws after that are based on the cards you play.  It has a cool mutation mechanic so you can get rid of goblins that no longer have a purpose as well as the activation markers that can be utilized to open up additional powers of certain goblins - though I used mine often to get extra cards.  You have to carefully determine which goblins will comprise your army as the mid-level goblins can only come in if you have a goblin of the same faction in the first rank and the top-level goblins come in only if you have one of the same faction in each of the first two ranks.  It's a great 2-player game and one that will make the table often in the years to come.

I've downgraded this based on the fact that the base game alone encourages losing the first round as you are likely to win 80% of the time.  The expansion, fortunately, corrects this.  It also makes the expansion a necessity to fix the base game.

Sold it. 

Why? 
It's what has become a standard tableau building game - lay down cards, they have some effects (some when card enters play, some you have to activate). The game has an interesting action restriction, but...

1. Theme is tangential to the game. Supposedly each player is building their army of goblins and there's a fight when the round ends. But. Doesn't feel like fighting or warfare, it's basically COMPARING ARMIES. Huh? Would make more sense with the theme of CHEER LEADING or FASHION SHOW.

2. Everything moves with tiny steps - creating a tableau/engine is like adding little small cogs together that don't do much. Kinda like Seasons, without the dice. There's no prominent card synergy, the game doesn't flow, it trickles. Also while there are some take-that effects here and there interaction is low. 

3. Hence kinda forgettable. Not bad, but. It's telling I like Catan card game better.

Pakliépítős kártyajáték, abból is a jobb fajta. Eredeti ötlet számomra a kártyák lerakásának szabálya. Egy 5x3-as területre rakjuk a kártyáinkat, amelyek 3 szintűek lehetnek ez reprezentálja a három sor. Az alsó sorban kezdünk első szintű kártyák letételével. Az első ingyenes, minden ugyanolyan színű szintén (5 szín van a játékban), bármilyen másik szín két kártya eldobásával tehető le. A második sor feltétele, hogy az első sorban legyen olyan színű kártya, illetve fizikailag is legyen alatta valamilyen lap. A harmadik szint ugyanez. Ezt megbolondítja az átváltozás, amivel bármilyen színű kártya játékba kerülhet, adott kártyaszám eldobásával a kézből, illetve cserélve az átváltoztatott kártyát. A kártyák sajnos szövegesek, de készül az ikonos változat. Ennek ellenére a szövegek alap nyelvtudással is olvashatók, érthetők. De igaz, az első játék ezek olvasásával telik. Második játékra a 100 kártya megjegyezhető, vannak azonosak is. Egy kör passzok után egy harccal zárul, egyszerűen össze kell adni a látható lapok pontjait minden félnek, akinek a legtöbb van kap egy győzelmi pontot. Ha egy játékos elér 3 pontot vége a játéknak a győzelmével. A játék tényleg lejátszható 20 perc alatt a lapok ismeretével, de inkább 1-1,5 órát kell számolni jó játékosok esetén.
Összességében abszolút pozitív az összkép. Nagyon tetszett a laplehelyezési, gyűjtési mechanizmus. Egyszerű és ötletes. Negatívumnak a nyelvfüggőséget tudom felhozni, illetve, hogy talán tényleg ketten lehet a legélvezetesebb, négyen már nagyon hosszúra nyúlhat.

Artwork is amazing, and really nifty gameplay with the card combos. Loved my first play of this so much that I bought it right away.

But the comeback mechanisms seem really strong in this game. I like a game that has ways to come back from a disadvantaged position because that's exciting, but worried they might be too strong here? the game seems pretty skill based, but it seems like you'd have to outplay someone by a really, really large margin to just dominate from start to finish... seems like a safer strategy is to sandbag so you can take advantage of the comeback mechanisms and just setup for round 5. Hope I'm wrong, because that'd be a little too "gamey" for my tastes... we'll see

Best with 2 players.

Cute economic engine game where you try to figure out how to get yourself out of a gummed up system.  You don't just get to draw cards so you have to figure out a way to find a steady card influx.  

It gets a little ridiculous when you have a million cards out with crazy superpowers and then a card comes out saying that you get to use anyone's powers.  So you have to constantly ask everyone what their powers are cause there is no way you could read the 8 pt type from farther away than your tableau.

Also, I felt really guilty forcing everyone to wait as I would constantly have to dig through the discard pile to find a card that served my purpose.  There is a ton of text that has to be digested all at once.  It was excessive.  But, if you want to win...

RATING: 6
There is a -ton- of text that needs to be digested with all of the different goblins and their varied superpowers, which makes the learning curve a whole hell of a lot steeper than you'd think from just reading the rules. Individual player turns can take an extremely long time when there are lots of goblins on the table and you've got to sort out their abilities before you make your play, and especially when you've got to dig through the discard pile for a Zombie Mutation. I can't even imagine the downtime and rules chaos with more than two players.

GoSu is fun as is and I trust that it gets tense and strategic once you have the gobbo's abilities and get a sense of the master deck composition, but I'm not sure I'm willing to put in the time to get that stuff down when I have a bunch of cool 30-minute two-players already.

It's been a while since I've had so little fun playing a game. I see a little bit of what they were trying to do here, but simply trying to cleverly re-arrange your tableau time after time to eke out a couple more points just isn't that much fun. In addition, it seems that way too much of the game is about luck of the draw: I spend most of my turn to be able to draw a couple more cards, and if I can end up playing one of them for free, that's awesome, but often I can't and so I'm just screwed. People also complain about the catch-up mechanism being too strong, although I can't say personally that it bothers me that much.

This is such a great game. Far more complicated than it first seems. Zombie mutation fundamentally changes how you have to think about your turns. You can sometimes just draw really badly but the (+1) abilities really help you come back. This is a very skill intensive game. In my top three now and I imagine will move up with 5 new clans from the expansion. Card evaluations will definitely change depending which 5/10 clans you shuffle up. A near perfect game!

When I sat down to play this game I was told more than anything else this game was about careful hand management.  And it most certainly is.

In this game players take turns playing cards into a 5x3 grid.  The cards are of three power levels and playing them follows a set of rules.  The cards are members of 5 different factions and playing higher level cards requires having a lower-level card of the same faction.  Also, playing a level 1 card of a faction you don't already have requires discarding cards.  And when you run out of room on a level of your grid you need to discard cards to replace it.

The reason this game is all about hand management is there is no draw step.  The only way to draw cards is by playing cards that let you draw, activating abilities on certain cards, or using activation tokens for a desperate inefficient draw.

That is what MAKES this game in my opinion.  It requires careful planning and decision making to not find yourself woefully behind in card advantage and finding the right balance of playing and using cards (the only way to win of course) or saving them to use later to greater effect is riveting.  The artwork is also very well done.

This game does, however, have a serious luck-of-the-draw problem.  Because of the punishing nature of playing cards in different factions (or not being able to play higher level cards in different factions) drawing too diverse a set of cards means sometimes nothing more than dumb luck can lose you a game.  If your opponent draws a set of level 1, 2, and 3 cards in the same faction and you have a motley assortment of different level cards from different factions then you're in trouble and there isn't a whole lot you can do to fix it.

My one play of this game was also with only 2 players and I think it works better with more.  Some of my cards affected multiple opponents and they lose their effectiveness when only playing against one opponent.

Fun game, easy rules, player interaction trough card effects, good combos but dependent on the draw. A good mix of strategy and tactics.

My rating is for the game if played with the advanced / tournament rules from the publisher's homepage.  

After the first game, where you learn the mechanics and get an overview over the existing cards and the gameplay of the different clans, you should ALWAYS use the advanced rules! They make the game faster and reduce the luck of the draw, making it more strategic.

Neat little non-collectible card game. It describes itself as a cross between Race for the Galaxy and Magic, but it doesn't really share too much with either. The gameplay is simple, you just plop down various goblins and let card text effects do the rest. Biggest army wins.

I have some doubts about how deep it is strategically as it does have a very strong random element. I'm almost sure that the cards aren't well balanced. On the other hand, even after a couple of games in I'm finding it hard to tell which cards are unfair. So maybe it's just that it approaches things from an angle different from your usual CCG-clone or eurogame, and I haven't quite wrapped my head around it yet. That would be a good thing!

In any case, it's fun, attractive, smartly designed, and quite different from other cardgames that fill a similar niche. I'm happy to have it!

Some good and some bad here. The bad: The cards are incredibly text-heavy, and the game is entirely card-power driven. Or to say things more plainly, reading what all the effects and powers of each card are is necessary and really bogs things down. I'm sure greater familiarity with the cards would improve this, but your first 10 or so plays are going to be pretty slow as both players read and grok their cards. Also on the negative side of the ledger is balance. The game has a little catch-up mechanism by which certain powers are augmented for a player who is behind in victory points. But it's not enough. Since players do not draw cards between rounds and get only two actions per round, the player who gets ahead early tends to stay ahead. Despite this, GOSU will remain on my game shelf for now because there are also some good things going on here. Reading time aside, the game plays pretty quickly and smoothly. The card powers and interactions are interesting, and the choices often are difficult. The theme is just OK, but the game has a decent fun factor. It's got some warts, but also some depth that is interesting to explore.

Neat little combos abound and hand management is key (although your hand is ultimately impossible to protect). I like the game's feel and flavor, and I like how hard it is to get cards, but the game has a few flaws, some minor (like balance being sort of out of whack) and some more major (like cards pulling from the discard pile, serious downtime in 3+ player games, and almost always wanting to lose round 1). It's a fine occasional 2P experience though.

In the end, an interesting idea that failed.

A desperation game with quirky art and a well done card mechanic working below the surface. Compact & sophisticated hand management. The tiny print is so-o-o tiny it hurts. 

An almost over-the-top catch-up mechanism. The best strategy may be to throw the first round.

Graphic design gets in the way of getting this played.

Fun to play cardgame with incredible artwork. I rate it about the same as Warhammer Invasion, even though it is an entirely different game. Gosu is mostly a tactical game: There are some card combinations to consider, but you mostly try to make the most of the cards that you draw (and you do not get to draw a whole lot of them). Warhammer is more strategic, in the sense that it offers more engine building options. What I like about Gosu, is that you can share a common deck. All of the card effects are easy to understand, and some of them are really clever. What I do NOT like is the necessity to sometimes go through the entire draw or discard pile, even though some of the cards have quite a lot of text on them.

good mechanics, nice artwork, but probably should have been a CCG.  drawing from a shared deck combined with heavy card variance means that luck is too strong of a factor.

Love the art.  I can see this game will have a lot of replay value with the high number of combos available.  Raised my rating from 7.5 to 9.  Excellent game that plays quickly, but has many meaningful decisions.  Christmas 2010 from my Mom with the help of Jenny.

This game strikes me as being great for two players who have never played it before but like things like magic the gathering, ascension, hearthstone, etc.  They can learn the rules, combos, card factions, and really enjoy pulling off things the other player didn't quite see coming.  But, once it has been played enough the strategy gets a little stale and having the right opening draws can dominate the experience.  I recommend it to friends who can play it the first time together and don't intend to play it excessively.  Can be played in a very usable form on board game arena.

I was really unimpressed with this game.  If you want crazy chaos, there are lots of better choices.  This game simply takes too long to play for a game that has so many unbalanced cards.

In the one game that we played, the "draw up until you have 7 (or 8)" card was used in just the right way, and it allowed a player with 0 VP to suddenly win the game.

The art work is really good.  For a game with this much text, the rules are pretty good, but there will be a few things you'll need to look up in the forums to understand what they mean.  That's never a good thing for a game that is supposed to be easy to play and short.

bad experience with this one

[+] some cool combos at the beginning
[-] ... but then snowball effect, every time you play a card/effect, you have to check effects of other cards, and it increases as the game progresses... it gets boring very fast. some random theme doesn't help.

RATING: 7
A card game in which you don't get to draw cards unless you work for it.  No automatically refreshing your hand, or one draw a turn, the only draws you get from this mean little game is those you manage to squeeze out of your hands, or those you are willing to give up an oh-so-valuable activation token to get.  Compounding the problem, what's the currency you need to expend to get your cards down on the table?  Why, discards, of course!  So your hand is even more restricted.

For a bite-sized, short battle game, this is quite a bit of fun.  It's more fun than playing preconstructed [gameid=463].  Replayability could be an issue, but I would say the same for something like [gameid=28143], so what do I know?  The changing battle position, and the slow trickle of deck could keep it interesting.  Definitely like the mechanic of the different factions.  Specializing in one means you don't have to discard as many cards, but does mean you won't be able to use as many of your draws.  More efficient, but more fragile.  Tasty!

Enjoying the the combo-heavy Gosu. Fast paced (but never try it with 4p though, unless playing in teams).

Want to try the team variant now.

As a side note, I am questionning its lasting power. It is good, but definitely not RFTG-good. And I am usually not up to playing consecutive games (not such a good sign...).

This isn't the sort of game I usually like.  It has a lot of chaos, due to the cards breaking the standard rules of the game, but it's surprisingly easy to track, since there aren't as many cards of those kinds as one would expect to find.  It also has a bit of take that, and a level of chaining certain actions that can sometimes prove to be a bit frustrating, but it all comes together into a tactical game of push and pull.  I'm not sure how I feel about the insta-win cards (it's nearly impossible to plan for them), but it's still something partway manageable, at least as far as not setting it up so that someone else can take the win from you playing one of those cards.  Plus, it's a nice balancing mechanism, since the level III cards, which are the most powerful as far as your army's strength, tend to allow other players to take the win away if you're not careful.  It probably helps that the game doesn't play overly quickly -- our first 4-player game took about 90 minutes -- and you have the time to think about what's happening with other people's armies during the game.  I like the idea behind the mutation, since it allows you ways to get new cards into your army, AND to activate certain goblins' special abilities.  It's a pretty clever system, and the quality of the components is well above average.  It also has some special actions that benefit those behind in points.  I like it.  I'm surprised, but I do like it.

In a fantasy world dominated by goblins, when the bloodmoon rises in the sky, a new war begins, and new warlords raise their armies.

GOSU is a hybrid of Race for the Galaxy and Magic: The Gathering. Each player raises an army of goblins made up of soldiers, heroes, magicians, and other classes.
\13\\13\
Each turn, a player can play a new goblin, activate a goblin, draw cards or pass. When all players have passed, the player with the most powerful army wins the battle. The first player to win 3 battles wins the game.

Fantasy interactive card game battling with goblins. First to win 3 battles becomes the reigning Goblin ruler. Start by recruiting low level grunts by clan and steadily build the strength of your force. Mutations and zombie turning are some powers. One clever aspect of strategy is managing how much of your finite deck is kept for later battles.

Familiarity with the cards and their many effects and interrelationships would improve gameplay, but I can't escape from the feeling that early cards dictate whatever long-term strategy players might have.

In our first attempt, a player pulled an out-of-the-blue victory thanks to a level 3 "I win!" card, which makes me wonder why we even bothered playing the first 30-45 minutes of the game.

Pros :  Neat looking cards.  Interesting and quick to play. Fun. Easy to learn.  Good tactical decisions.

Cons : Very random.  Prone to some players having actions and others having none for quite a while.  Strategy doesnt change much between games though tactics do.

Very CCGish.
My main complaints:
 - text on cards - I'm so used to icons in R4TG that this is a big drawback for me
 - very little hand management - you've got little cards and you're very luck depenedent on what you'll got from the draw (will I have a card that allows me to draw more cards?)
 - downtime. When I pass and my oponnent still play it's very painful. I can't imagine this as a 4 player game or even 3 player.
 - deck - small and collective - it's pointless to try to prepare for certain cards because probably you won't see cards you want hence it's more tactical and I don't like it

I wanted to play this game because it was called a child of R4TG and Magic. It's not R4TG on any means. It's not  enough to have "play a card or discard cards to pay for playing a card" to call a game R4TG-like. Game has to have more than that. 

R4TG is still the best STRATEGIC card game there is out there. Period

Its Magic:The Gathering without the collecting and deck building!  This one is all about card combos, creature interaction and building the biggest tableau.  It can run a bit long depending on player count, but I think this is a great game for folks with M:TG nostalgia.  I ended up giving my copy to a friend who works with younger kids as he has a lot more opportunities to play 2-3 player games with it which is where this game shines.

I really wanted to like this game as it is reminiscent of MTG.  I do adore the artwork and the humorous goblin theme plays out really well in both the artwork and card abilities.

As far as gameplay goes though, there is A LOT to be desired.  After several plays, each game pretty much felt exactly the same as the last.  Also, it is highly luck driven, therefore, very little strategy affects winning conditions.  Yes you do have actions on your turn, but luck is what determines your actual available actions.  Without luck, your actions are nearly pointless.

My game group tried different strategies to see which ones work best and it was ultimately decided that the game just isn't complex enough to create fulfilling turns... yet alone a satisfying gaming experience overall.

Fun game with interesting combos. Can be difficult to play them if you have to rely on the right cards to show up though. I've mostly played with 2, hoping to get some 3 or 4 games in soon though.

Nice little step up from cottage garden and two steps up from Patchwork. More to think about and the spacial element is heightened with holes in the forest floor and resource management. Good fun, would recommend for genre fans! Doesn't 'kill' anything for me, I am happy to have the game play options of all the iterations, including Barenpark. Probably like this title best ATM.

Abstract:
Another tetris-style game by Uwe Rosenberg. It is a spiritual successor to Patchwork. Each player has to completely fill up his board with tetris tiles. First one initiate the end of the game. Each tetris tile has a hole, players have to match the whole with the symbols on the player board.

Pros:
+ Special powers and upgrading/downgrading powers offer more decisions (than in Patchwork)
+ Race game requires trade-offs: play big tiles to fill more spaces or play particular tiles to get special powers?
+ Easy to teach
+ Quick game (with lower player counts)
+ Plays well with all player counts
+ Family-friendly
+ Artwork is cute and really good

Neutrals:
# Some take-that by stealing tiles
# Set-up is a little bit fiddly but still quick
# Player interaction by snagging tiles before another player does

Cons:
- Theme exists but it feels pasted on
- Special animal tiles should be more special

Thoughts:
I did not like frequently counting buttons (money) in Patchwork. Indian Summer replaces money management with collecting special action tokens. Indian summers feels in some way more constructive, you do not have to wait or save money for a particular tile. However, stealing tiles from other players is not my favorite kind of player interaction.

Similar games:
* Patchwork (2-player only, has money management, no special powers)
* Cottage Garden (more Zen-like, relaxed game)
* Bärenpark (super easy to teach and play, but set-up is super annoying)

Player: 1-4 (best: 2-3) | Time: 15m per player

A fun variation of Patchwork/Cottage Garden. It manages to feel familiar, and yet different from either of those games. Beautiful to look at, and the treasures and animals add a nice element. It's a fast-playing race, and our two two-player games have both been very close.

A korábbi klónokhoz képest a lapkákon lévő lyukasztások adják az új ötletet, ami egy tök jó új dimenziót hoz a műfajba, egyúttal nehezebbé is teszi szerintem. Nem mondom, hogy jobb, mint mondjuk a Cottage Garden, de mindenképp más ezektől a lyukaktól. Nem rossz, de kezd kicsit unalmas lenni ez a sok variáns:)

Better than I expected! I love Patchwork, Cottage Garden not quite as much but was happy it kinda gave me Patchwork at three player. So I really didn't think I needed Indian Summer. And I wasn't sure about the visual style, or those odd-looking holes in the tiles. It was my wife's pick.

But wow, neat little game that differs enough from Patchwork that I am really happy to have both. Good at two player, and I like it at three even more. Three player shakes it up a bit, to be slightly more chaotic and less predictable in a good way.

Four player I suspect still works well but with a smidge more chaos than I would like and then maybe there would be a hint of downtime. At three player you can figure out your options nicely while waiting for your next turn and weigh up the what-ifs reasonably well.

What I love about Patchwork is its "design purity" that I think got a bit lost in Cottage Garden. Indian Summer, I love the bit more thinkyness in where to place your tile and when to cash in your bonuses. And I love scoring those bonuses and the pressure to use them early. I think this is a much more clever design than it may look at first glance.

If you loved Patchwork but Cottage Garden has put you off of trying this one, take a look at Rahdo's playthrough.

Also, visually, it looks quite beautiful in the flesh. The dark boards looked a bit odd to me online, but when you see them in person they have a lovely damp dark soil texture and the animals look nicer too. You really get a feeling of nature and autumn.

My wife has done it again. I didn't think we needed it. I was wrong. I'd rush and buy it  now!

Initial rating 8 on my new tougher scale (I need to update many of my scores), which means I think this is an excellent game, and it might go higher and get similar love to the gem that is Patchwork.

RATING: 6
The next iteration of patchwork & Cottage Garden.  I do think I like this a little bit better than Cottage Garden, but Patchwork is still the best game of the 3.  The "Race" aspect of this one is interesting, and even the player with the most spots to fill on the last turn can really catch up and do well if they setup some cool combos to fire off on their last turn.  More "mean" than the other 2 games as well, as you can steal tiles, but there are ways to defend yourself if you plan well.  Not something I am super excited about, but its something I wouldn't mind playing from time to time.

RATING: 6
A neat tile-laying game in the vein of Patchwork, with the goal of being the first player to completely cover their board.

However, there are a few more things to consider here. Namely, each piece has a hole in it, and you want those holes to line up with bonus spaces on your playing board. The bonuses allow you to do things like place a 1-square tile onto you board, steal tiles from other players, or play two of your tiles in one turn, and are crucial to achieving the small edge you need to beat the other players. They also make placing tiles ideally much more difficult, as not only are you trying to cover your board, but you're trying to do it in a way where your holes are on the right spaces.

Overall, a nice, casual game that requires a good amount of thought as well.

If reworking your worker placement games works like a charm why would you want to stop at that? Indian Summer is Rosenberg's third iteration of the tile drafting series that started out with Patchwork. It offers a little more freedom to players than its immediate predecessor Cottage Garden and dumps the clunky scoring - both upsides in my view. I do very much mourn the loss of the highly interactive drafting in that game, however, and its highly thematic substitution for queues in the Canadian forests.

Beautiful looking game. I enjoy the elements in this one as you are taking a "walk" through the autumn forest (completing your board), encountering animals and other forest treasures along the way.

This game is different from other patchwork style games because there are no points per say and it's all a big race to complete your board first. It's much easier to get 1x1 tiles and tension for exact tiles is almost non existent. Using the different treasures you collect and getting more bonuses seems to be the key to winning. Definitely the fastest of the multiplayer iterations

Dans la lignée de Patchwork et de Cottage Garden, voici l'été indien. C'est un beau plateau, c'est une belle mécanique (air connu).
Pour les quelques uns qui n'ont pas idée de cette famille de jeux : on a un petit plateau personnel, on ramasse des pièces la tétris et on essaie de remplir son plateau avec les pièces sans laisser de trous.
Ici, des feuilles mortes remplissent notre petit potager en carrés. Les pièces ont un trou, qu'on peut placer sur certains espaces de notre potager qui comportent une icône. Si on le fait et qu'on finit de remplir un carré, alors on récolte (noisettes, myrtilles, champignons, etc.). Cette récolte nous permet des actions spéciales. Celui qui finit son potager arrête le jeu et on compte les points. Celui qui a le plus de noisettes l'emporte.
Si on "aligne" plusieurs trous de la bonne manière, alors on attire un animal (renard, hérisson, ...) qui nous permet une double récolte.
C'est tout. C'est beau, super simple et bien foutu. Je suis bien en peine de dire lequel est le meilleur de ces jeux. Patchwork n'est qu'à deux joueurs. A vous de voir. Il en faut un dans une bonne ludothèque mais pas la peine de les collectionner, amha.

This is an amazing solitaire tetris puzzle race played at a table of you and up to 3 friends! Sometimes someone will use a mushroom token to take a tile from you on their turn (but that is their whole turn) and maybe they take a special animal tile from the middle of the table before you but really, you can just.... do your tetris puzzle while ignoring everyone.

Which might be fine! If you don't want much interaction.
But if you do want more interaction, look at Cottage Garden?

RATING: 5
Yet anther Uwe game utilizing polyominoes. This one has a few twists. The most noteworthy being that the tiles each have a hole cut out of them so that they can expose the space beneath them.

Each player has a player mat and the goal is to be the first player to completely fill it in. With each player placing one piece each turn that would be pretty deterministic so the game boils down to using a ton of little free actions to get the edge on your opponents. 

You want to place the holes so that they expose bonuses and then use those bonuses to get more bonuses. With the right bonuses you can essentially take a double turn, and the more of that you can manage the more winning you will achieve. 

I like Cottage Garden quite a bit. I find that there is a good amount of forward planning and you also need to watch your opponents to know which tiles they have access to and which ones they are likely to take. In Indian Summer I cared a lot less about what my opponents were doing. I also had so much flexibility once the bonuses started rolling in that forward planning was less meaningful.

I don't much care for race games, but this one is particularly bad since it also has a rich-gets-richer mechanism. Whoever does the best job of hitting the bonus wave early will be in prime position to ride it to victory.

Given the short play time this game has quite a lot of components and annoying setup. I would play only if someone else were keen on trying it.

RATING: 7
Rosenberg is prone to flogging a dead horse. Indian Summer follows the formula first used for Patchwork, reused in A Feast for Odin and then varied by Cottage Garden. Indian Summer is supposed to be the gamer version of Cottage Garden which itself was the multiplayer family version of Patchwork. 

Indian Summer lacks the elegance and simplicity of Cottage Garden but gives players more to think about and manipulate. It keeps the family-friendly theme and is one of Rosenberg's focused design (contrary to his sprawling epics).

Is it successful and needed? Yes, if you like easier games as a regular gamer. No, if you are a family gamer or a heavy gamer with limited interest in simple games.

Cottage Garden / Patchword / Barenpark trying to be deeper & smart.  You have too much information up front, there's a lot of AP, which also means a lot of waiting for other players turn.  I don't know if there's a solo mode, but it feels it should be a solo game.  It's very pretty visually, but it's just a grind to play and there isn't much there ultimately.  Skip this, get Barenpark instead.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I wasn't sure I was going to enjoy this one due to what I heard about stealing pieces from opponents. It didn't bother me like I thought it might once I played and I can understand why it is in place. Not sure why they went with a larger box either. Similar to Cottage Garden/Patchwork except the holes in the pieces allow you to potentially gain special bonus chits which are either advanced or free actions.

Race game to get your plate filled the quickest with pieces in various shapes that you draw from a line as we know from the series. There is something more to it: each piece has a hole in it.

Much better than Cottage Garden and a good variation multiplayer from Patchwork.

Hard game to rate.  The gameplay is tight, straightforward but challenging.  It works very well, even if the rulebook is a bit daft in its making very simple actions appear complicated.  Gorgeous to look at...the animal illustrations are outstanding.  But, it took a nice, relaxing game like Cottage Garden and turned it into a bit of a nasty game of blocking frined, stealing prime tiles, and generally allowing for kingmaking moves.  It is not a game I want to casually play with my wife anymore, and for that reason I have downgraded its score.  So, it is not for the game but for the situations in which I could play the game.  Too light for a real battle with my friends, too nasty for a nice, calm evening with my sweetie.

RATING: N/A
I hated Uwe because he was (re)designing the same farming game again and again and again... 

Despite my bad feelings for him I tried out Mamma mia and Patchwork and loved them both. Then I said maybe he isn't a bad guy after all. And then...

Indian summer, cottage garden and if course Feast for odin (why everybody forgets this one and talks of a trilogy;). 

Hate him again officialy.

Something was missing compared to Patchwork - I guess the economy part of getting enough buttons together (aka cash) to buy better pieces off the selection. Then again this game is much prettier. Would play again.

I like puzzling, but in this game it's a puzzle-race and I don't like racing. And it seems that the latter is dominant here, so this is not the type of game I enjoy. In fact, you simply want those red pieces as much as possible as they help you a lot in the race.

Mix of Barenpark and Cottage Garden. There is more depth here but it is a race game to fill your board first. It is gorgeous and one I would rather play over the other 2. I liked it very much.

Successor to Cottage Garden, probably prefer this one better: theme (reminds of Morels) a little more interaction, race mechanic.

RATING: 6
In this game players get a hand of tetris tiles, and a board that's sectioned off into six areas. Each tile has a hole in it. Each board has some number of printed reward spots. If you line a tile up with a hole, it will produce that reward when it's section is filled. Generally the rewards accelerate your ability to place tiles or improve your choices in terms of getting the tile you want. The ultimate goal of the game is to finish your board first. If you want to get really clever and drive yourself crazy you can line up the holes in your tiles in specific patterns so that you can claim one of the central tiles that will have those hole spots rewards produce a second time.

There's some minor player interaction in the game, in that one of the tokens allows you to steal one tile from two of your opponent's hands, but this is pretty minor in terms of impact since the tile you can steal is limited to the oldest tile in their hands, which often isn't the one you or they actually needed. The art in the game is fabulous.

The game is short, and light. I liked it slightly more than Cottage Garden, a similar game by the same designer that I feel somewhere between positive and ambivalent about, but really both games are good, not great. However, a low stress game like this with beautiful components appeals to my wife, so this is a keeper for the time being.

:star: Art, Iconography and components functional
:nostar: Clever or interesting mechanisms
:nostar: Reasonably low downtime between turns with mildly AP players
:star: Multiple plays stay interesting
:star: Low or mitigatable luck elements
:star::star::star::nostar::nostar: Raw enjoyment

This is an "OK" game. Seems like a combination of Patchwork and Cottage Garden, with a little more player interaction (you can "steal" tiles from opponents) and tries to put in more options with the items you can find. But in the end, it falls a bit flat for me. Cottage Garden just feels like a better experience, Patchwork is pretty much the same game but plays faster with more fun.

Not one I'd rush to play in the future.

I really like Patchwork, and prefer that by a mile to this. Where Patchwork has clear and interesting choices, this is overloaded and obscure. Very low interaction.

The taking of tiles from others look like interaction, but mainly mean you can not plan your turn in advance. 

The tiles are too balanced, it does not matter all that much which ones you take, there are so many and so many positions to choose from. 

It feels like a disguised point salad, whatever you do you will likely get you just about the same amount of progress.

[b]Caveat:[/b] I’ve only played this as a 2-player game, my :thumbsup: and :thumbsdown: are based on that.

:thumbsup: Gorgeous watercolour illustrations and graphic design that breathes love and care.
:thumbsup: [person=10][/person] succeeds in making each of his polyominoe puzzle games feel familiar yet different enough.
:thumbsup: The solo variant feels more challenging than in [thing=204027][/thing].

:thumbsdown: This is aimed at family gamers, yet the finer nuances of gameplay seem to be a bit lost on that audience (in my experience): the win condition is presented as [i]‘fill your board first’[/i], but there’s more to it than that.
:thumbsdown: The box is too big for its contents...

Azért ehhez kell egy arc, amit Uwe csinál, Agricola-Caverna, Patchwork-Cottage Garden és most az Indian Summer. A tetriszezésre így ráfeküdni, ennyire eladható ez a mechanizmus mostanában? Nem sok kedvel ültem le a játék mellé, de a grafika nagyon bejött és a túrázás, mint téma közel áll hozzám, de persze ebből semmi nem jön át a játék során. 5 véletlenszerű elemmel kezdünk, amelyekből bármelyiket választhatjuk beépítésre, célunk a mindenki számára azonos nagyságú terület minél hamarabb és minél jobb beborítása avarral. Közben próbálni a tetrisz elemeken található 1-1 lyukakkal nem letakarni a földön található makkokat, mogyorókat, gombákat és tollakat, amelyeket a később a köreink során felhasználva gyorsabban feltölthetjük a tetriszelemeinket, 1x1-es elemeket szerezhetünk, az ellenfelinktől 1-1 elemet elcsenhetünk a még nem felhasználtakból és kétszer is jöhetünk. Vannak még állatokat reprezentáló tetrisz elemek is, amik az egymás mellé elhelyezett lyukakra tehetők, ezzel még egyszer megszerezve a lyukakban található bónusz jelzőket. A játék bonyolítja az előd Cottage Gardent. Én úgy érzem aki a tetriszezésben jó, az minden ilyen játékban jó lesz, nekem kicsik a különbségek a játékok között, nem érzem úgy, hogy értelme lenne ezekből egynél több beszerzése. A Cottage Gardenhez képest -1 pont a bonyolultabb volta miatt és -1 pont az újabb rokabőrért.

Another Rosenberg polyomino game where the winner is the first to fill up their board. Tiles have holes in them which frame icons printed on the boards; completing a region grants ability tokens matching those tiles. Sets of holes placed to form a shape grant additional tokens.

These tokens provide crucial abilities to acquire desired tiles, place squirrels (1x1 filler blocks), steal tiles from other players or place two in one turn. They're really the heart of the game.

It's good. Maybe a bit overwrought. Need to keep track of your own tiles, other players' tiles (to steal with mushrooms), other players' boards (competition for special tiles), [i]and[/i] solve your private placement puzzle, so some room for AP -- particularly problematic as it's quite easy to have a plan disrupted by other players. Seems likely best with fewer players for that little bit less to keep track of.

I wouldn't play again with more than 3.

Compared to Patchwork & Barenpark this is an overly complex migraine inducing bore. It took me 4 instructional videos to get this one down and I was stil left with questions. It’s also not the lovely autumnal image at game end that people rave about. It just becomes an indistinguishable Jackson Pollack autumn nightmare. This has really put me off wanting to try any more Tetris based games.

tl;dr: OK puzzle game

I quite enjoyed [thing=204027][/thing] when I played it. I quite enjoyed this game when I played it. But not as much.
So you place some tiles on the board, trying to puzzle them together in the most efficient way and score bonuses where possible. Bit it just didn't have the spark Cottage Garden had for me.
But if you want more of the same but different, give it a shot. Maybe I'm wrong!

Second game in Uwe Rosenberg's trilogy that begins with Cottage Garden. Indian Summer also uses the tetris puzzle system but this time it's more of a gamer's game and I really like it. It's a nice transition for non-gamers or new players who can taste the joy of boardgaming with Cottage Garden and when they handle it they can move to this one. I hope that the third instalment will be little more complex than this one so the path to the boardgame side can be complete. :-)

Wonderful puzzle game with direct interaction: it's possible to steal each other's pieces depending on the place in line. So when you pick up pieces, you always have to keep in mind that other players take them from you. That makes for a much more tense experience than Cottage Garden.

Artwork is stellar, once your board is full with the leafy puzzle pieces, here and there an animal on top (fox! badger!) and filled up with squirrels, it's very hard to put everything back in the box.

RATING: 8
+ no player elimination
+ balanced
+ interaction and competition in place, you get better if you watch and scout your opposer
+ a bit building engine, building and collecting on hand
+ no dominant playing-strategy, You don't have to collect the feather and mushrooms as fast as possible but before someone complete his/her puzzle. Actions depends on your rivals, long game solving, Look out for anyone else prepare to pick up the badger or the fox.
+ challenging, long learning curve, solutions depends on your opponents skills
+ good blocking mechanics, prevent the leader from winning, but in the final stage it's hard to catch up if you played worse or lose sight of your opposer
+ fun, the race create a tension and sometimes a breathless suspension (Who might put a spoke in your wheel? Could you scheme or intersect?)
- managing the findings always shifts your puzzle

I adore Patchwork both as a gateway game and as a quickie for two. I've waited long for the Garden to bring four players into the world of Patchwork at once, and now this happens - a gamer-oriented edition of Patchwork? Must have, no questions asked :D

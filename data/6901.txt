Best four player game I've ever played with a standard deck.  I was raised in the Midwest where everyone seems to play this game and play it well.

Played this a lot on rainy days in high school.  More a time waster than an enjoyable game, but it was always fun to win after 'going alone.'

RATING: 5
I play it when asked, but it feels very mechanical to me - every hand nearly plays itself and I routinely do so without thinking. So not something I long for, but many in my area know and consider to be a good card game experience. Therefore, I play when asked.

RATING: 7
This game is huge in the Midwest of America – and since my husband and I are from there originally, it is not surprising we know it. The game is all about taking tricks and trusting your partner. My husband and I play a mean game of euchre. We form a wonderful team, and even when we are forced to play against one-and-other it is a close game. 

My favorite is “going alone” – when you have so many high cards, that you tell your partner to sit out. When this happens, your partner sets down their cards and doesn't play while you take the field solo, attempting to win at least three tricks out of five. There was one time when I had four of the five highest cards and was able to win a trick with the low card in my hand – taking all five tricks for a total of 4 points. It was glorious!

The only problem with this game is that we need exactly four players to play, and we are rarely in a group that is that number.

My roommate loves this game, I do not. It's not a game of strategic decision making at all. You get 5 cards and the optimal move is always obvious. Once you know how to play it's simply a game of luck and signalling your teammate secretly.

Euchre is an interesting game that involves some strategy and a lot of luck.  I'm usually not a big fan of the trick taking games (bridge and spades, for example), but this one appeals to me.  Maybe it's having less cards.  I like it.

RATING: 7.5
My rating is based on a belief that Euchre is something of a party game.  If more natural conversation doesn't arise, at least you can talk smack and second-guess play decisions.  It's good at that: play moves fast, and there's a nice rhythm of a few interesting decisions (the bidding, the first couple of rounds) followed by the game basically running on automatic.

RATING: 7
This is one of those traditional card games that is almost required knowledge if you live in Michigan.  It's enjoyable to play, but after a few thousand games your moves start to feel a bit programmed.  Yes, that's right I said a few thousand, that's how common this game is around here.  I played it so many times growing up and still play it occasionally as an adult.  The youth at church used to ask to play it on a daily basis.  This caused some massive burnout after awhile.

However, going back to it now, I still get enjoyment out of the game.  It's a fun and very fast partnership game.  We even host occasional tournaments where you change partners every game and keep track of scores and victories.  The player with the highest overall score wins.  It makes for a fun evening and, since nearly every person in the region knows the game, there is little or no teaching necessary to play it.  The biggest drawback to the game is that, since you play with so few cards, it is very easy for unscrupulous players to stack the deck.  If you play with people you trust, though, this can be a fun game for players of all ages.

I've played this game so many times over the years that I can't even count.  We've played it again recently as we're learning Bridge to get my wife up to speed on how to play trick-taking games with trump.  Euchre is a very simple game for that so it teaches the concepts well.  As much as I've enjoyed certain times when I've played this with family and friends over the years, I can't say that it's a really good game.

I've played this more than I've played Cribbage, which is remarkable as I've played Cribbage thousands of times, since my in-laws also grew up with this game and it was easier to play at swim meets (no board required).  I've played on pool decks, at VFWs, at weddings, on busses... to the point where the decisions involved have become automatic.  It's a great game when it is secondary to conversation.  I'd much prefer to play 3p sheesphead with rotating dealer if I actually want to play [i]a game[/i].

There are oh-so-many better alternatives to this game.  There is nearly no strategy involved.  After a few rounds, all your plays are predirected, making the entire thing a big pile of luck.  That's ok most of the time, but this game attempts to disguise the luck as strategy.  Ugh.  Go play Hearts instead.

Games like this are can be fun to play.  The rough part is that 75% of your plays are (almost) forced.  The fun is when you have choices of plays, are leading, or are deciding on whether to choose trump.  But since it's so easy to explain, fast to play a hand, and many people have played under the influence, it's still fun after all these years... and I'm not even from the midwest.

My 2nd favorite card game that I'll play (not involving money). I played it so much in college that my choices are now on autopilot. Still, I'm surprised by how many people play (or played) this game. Decent filler at a party... or if you're in a jury room waiting for two hours while the lawyers negotiate.

Update: I've learned Tichu, played it enough to hold my own, and now I never ever need to play Euchre again unless it's the only game three other people know.

I played hundreds if not thousands of games of Euchre when I was young.  Easily the simplest of the bidding/trick taking, partnership card games.  A great way to introduce these concepts to someone completely new.  In the long run,  Euchre should be a gateway to more sophisticated games, but it's a good starting point.

RATING: 4
You are playing with something like 24 cards distributed between four players.  The decision you make each turn, whether to order up trump or not, is simple.  If you're strong in the turned-up suit, you order it up.  If you aren't, you sit there, wait for the other side to play it, or hope that you get a chance to call something else.  

Card play is pretty much programmed once the hand starts.  You either bleed everyone else's trump, hope your three aces all carry, or count on being able to trump if you're short-suited.

It's easy to play and a pleasant enough partnership game.  But the strategy is about as shallow as a puddle.

I'd never heard of Euchre until I moved to the Midwest, where I quickly discovered how popular this trick-taking game is. There are two main variants, turn-up and bid Euchre; my experience lies mostly with the former. Once you become good at this game, it mostly plays itself: the hardest decisions come when deciding to stick the dealer or not. It's always amusing to watch someone unfamiliar with the game try to puzzle out the rules when we'll end the round after three or four tricks because we know what the next two plays will be. 

There's usually an "optimal" move in Euchre, and following a few rules of thumb (like counting on your partner for one trick and always leading with your highest off-suit card) leads to much of the rote quality of the game. Having said that, Euchre is still a lot of fun to play. There isn't much thought required, and the game lends itself well to chatting and joking around while playing. It's a low-concentration game with a bit of strategy--perfect for game nights as a warm-up filler. I don't think I'll ever get tired of playing it.

Bid Euchre is THE way to play.

Winning bidder announces trump suit, no trump-low, or no trump-high. See Pagat.com for rules.

A tempo game to rival all tempo games.  That is, if you have 3 friends willing to hang out, drink beer, listen to music, and chat, then there are few things to occupy your hands better than Euchre.  It encourages a nice level of banter as well.

A very nice 4 - player partnership game for those who want to learn how to play a game in a few minutes. The rules are pretty simple. Playing well requires the partnership to be together a bit but still you can play this pretty well even after only a few minutes if you have any card sense at all.

RATING: 5
This game has far too little strategy. I've easily played 1000 games of this in my high school years and with anything but four people as teams, the game plays itself - watching a computer similuation play would be as exciting. With four it gets a little better, but there just isn't much game there.  Play any number of better but similar games such as Hearts, Spades, or Pinochle for real fun.

I was taught this in college, and my reaction was basically that this is dumbed-down spades, which is already dumbed-down bridge.  Why bother?  There are so many better games to be played with a standard deck of cards that I wouldn't ever waste my time with this again.

I own a pair of euchre decks. Fast, social, easy, and addictive. More strategy than most games played with a deck of cards. You do hit a point where you can only play so well. Once you know the "right" things to do, and have a feel for how your partner plays, the hands pretty much play themselves. 500 improves this significantly while still maintaining the fun of euchre.

A fairly simple trick taking game with some risk taking as a portion of the cards are undealt/concealed depending on the number playing (I've exclusively played with 2). I can see the appeal for family gatherings, but Euchre falls neatly into the 'hmmm' category for me as it involves neither bidding (as in Nap) nor bluffing (as in Watten).

Who knows how many games I have played of this.  Probably the most game I've played considering how much I played in college.  Hundreds of times isn't out of the question.  It's a quick learn for those familiar with a trick taking game.  A newbie may take several games to get the hang of it.  It takes maybe 30 minutes of play and I love the way the game can be played and have a conversation while you play.  Or maybe that's because we've played so much.  I donno.  It does have some strategy in it, however it's clear to me now that there's more luck to it in that equation.  It's a must play since everyone has a deck of cards (so no cost) and it's short enough to be a filler or several for a main course as a party type game.  I'd highly recommend giving this consideration being a game in your regular game rotation.

Nov08: Another one I'm just now going back to.  I've played this one 100s of times.  I learned it from my Grandparents, so it has a soft spot in my heart.

How do I like it though? Meh.  The hands play themselves for the most part.  There's usually one uncertain play, and then the rest of the tricks will fall as you predict them.  I can always amaze my wife when I predict by the second trick who has the left, right and ace of trump.

The bidding is still somewhat interesting.  I usually play way overly aggressive just to be amusing.

Some of the bid Euchre variants are okay, but I'd rather just play Spades.

Still, it's not a bad game to be the past time of the Midwest.  At least it's partnership so you have someone to blame when things go badly.

This is a pretty good trick taking card game.  However, I've soured on it because of YEARS of having to play it with my family.  It was the only game I played with my family growing up.  Due to the small number of cards (24), the rules of the game, and the sheer number of times I've had to play, it just seems like I've now had to play through every situation so many times that I'm just going through the motions and there is little left to think about.

This game is a classic.  Not a game I think about all the time, or am constantly [b]needing[/b] or [b]wanting[/b] to play, but one I'm almost always willing to play for a few games.

I've only ever played it four-player in pairs, and I think the game truly shines when played with the same "teams" over the course of several games (not just hands, but games).  Doing this, you can really start to learn your partner's risk tolerance / aversion / appetite.  My wife and I have been playing with another couple (guys against gals) for years and we've really gotten to know how our partners play.

The game is very social as well, with hands typically lasting only a short time followed by discussion of what went wrong/right with the hand (usually to better know how your partner plays).  Best played with people you can trash talk with.

Oh yeah, this is a must:

I could just never really get into this one.  The game is too luck driven, and the shortened deck allows less skillful play than other games.  This is a better game with partners, which simply makes it playable.  I just like other card games better (Hearts, Pinochle, Bridge, Spades, Oh Hell, and even Contract Rummy.  If you really have to play with a shortened deck, try Sheepshead.

Euchre is just about the best game you can play in a high school cafeteria or at lunch in a fraternity house. From personal experience alone, of course.

Wore this game out in High School. Still love it; it's not without subtleties, and most people aren't that interested in learning how to play. While it's pointless to bitch about an old nut like Euchre that'll never change, I've often felt like it would benefit from an Oh Hell-like bidding mechanism for tricktaking that could enhance the strategy a little. That said, short of bridge, this is as interesting as a simple little tricktaking card game gets.

A card game that only uses the 9,10,J,Q,K,A of each suit which focuses on trump.  Each player receives 5 cards and are partnered with another player.

Euchre is a classic card game that, unless you happen to live in Michigan, you're unlikely to have heard of. I'd certainly never heard of it before moving there, nor since leaving the state -- which is a shame.

The secrets of its appeal are sticking with the same partner (so that you can learn each other's approaches, leanings, and push-your-luck thresholds, etc.), deciding when to push your luck, making the most of a bad situation, smack-talk, and cheating. I usually enjoy pushing my luck and seeing what I can do with what I was dealt, and in combination with Euchre's other unique elements the end result is an excellent game.

The cheating aspect is unique. I don't cheat at games, but with Euchre it's part and parcel with playing the game. You can certainly play it without cheating (and it's still fun), but you're more or less expected to cheat.

Whatever you do...don't call diamonds if your partner turned down hearts!  Even though they are completely different suits, this apparently is considered playing badly...which doesn't seem to make a lick of sense to me.  Basically it's a game of...pick a random suit and hope your partner has a lot of those...and then proceed to lose to the partners that have a cheating system.  Oh what great fun.

The pre-eminent card game in my house growing up in Akron, Ohio, so I'm probably biased. That said, I play on a multi-player app now, and unlike other card games, I find I'm simply not tiring of it.

There is more strategy involved here, and non-obvious strategy, than is given credit for in other comments and forum posts; just like with many forms of poker, there is a large element of luck (enough that a partnership of total novices can beat pros), but the better, more experienced players will absolutely win out more over time.

Regional game that is most popular (judging by this app) in the Great Lakes regions of the US and Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.

An old favorite.

When I was 18 and worked at the local movie theatre, one day management called me into the office and closed the door. There were 3 managers in there waiting for me, they said we needed to talk. Of course I was nervous. They asked if I knew how to play euchre because they needed a fourth.

That was the day I learned euchre.

I have Tichu now, Euchre has been replaced.

Using only the cards from 9 to Ace in a standard 52 card deck, in teams of two, declare the trump suit and take tricks. This game introduces the right bauer and left bauer, the jack in the trump suit and the jack in the other colored suit. Easy to learn and play, probably a good introduction to trump before moving on to bridge. Once lost $62 playing this game for money.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Suit based trick taking game that has a number or rules that are both unintuitive and don't add much to gameplay. Limiting the deck dramatically (only 5 cards per hand) means that the card play is often trivial. Play Spades or, if you are really ambitious, Bridge instead.

Easy my favorite game to play with a deck of cards. While many people outside of the state of Indiana haven't played or even heard it, I've played thousands of games over the last decade with dozens of different players/partners. Would probably rate it higher, but I'm pretty burnt out on it.

Initial Review: 7.75

Edit: I think I'm gonna settle on the mid to low 7-range. I realize once you're good enough at the game, the hands seem pretty cut and dry with what you should play. It really comes down to what you are dealt and what type of play-style you have.

With a heavy emphasis on trash talking, I kind of like this super simple trick-taking game. Not sure why, probably nostalga from the hundreds of games I played in high school. Heavily played in Ohio, I have found no one in PA or NY who knows much about this game.

2014: I have a couple of plastic score-keepers my grandmother bought be as a gift when she was at a German tourist village in Michigan. My wife also bought be a closeout copy because she recognized the name. I will probably try to introduce this again at some point, but I think Clubs has the upper hand for these types of situations.

I've probably played this game 500-1000 times in my life, as it was a family and friend's favorite.  It's one of my top card games, simple to teach, however has some strategy.

One issue is that sometimes your hands are on autopilot with having to follow suit and not having cards which allow decision making.

If you're looking for something "meatier", should look to 500.

Euchre - it's simple, it's "beer and pretzels" and I think it's great fun.  

Double Deck Euchre - take a 2 Euchre decks and you have what is very likely my favorite card game of all time.  Unfortunately, only about 2% of Euchre players know double deck euchre and since DDE is much more involved, it does not get as much play.

I mostly play euchre online these days as it's four player. We played euchre tons in college, along with cribbage, which has endeared both games to my heart.

At least among people I know, not many in the northeast seem to know how to play euchre. Judging from my online games and the fact the person who taught me the game hailed from Michigan, it seems to be more of a midwestern game.

It's difficult for me to say how many games of Euchre I've played.. I believe I have been playing it on and off for the past 15 years of my life, and I think I've racked up about 400 or so games during that period.  After you've played it so many times, you can basically imagine and see every hand on the table.. the low card count is key here.  The kitty is often revealing, cut-throat is our only way. Ahhh... the coffee house years.  Really is a great game for cards, fun and competitive play.

The strategy in this game is to wake yourself up from the stupor, induced by this game's mindless card play, when you get a hand with which you have to take a calculated risk. These moments are unfortunately few and far between. 

Anyway, the small hand size prevents clever card play. There's not much room for card counting because a proportionally page amount of cards have been removed from the deck. 

For ultra light trick taking games, I'd go with Belote de Comptoir or David Parlett's Minimisère.

A very cool trick taking game that is all about bidding confidently.  It uses the German deck, which is 9-Ace, which makes for a tight, fast game.  I am more used to its bigger brother Spades, and feel more comfortable with the larger number of tricks.  However, Euchre is a great partnership card game, where you want to win the bid in order to determine trump, which is always a cool idea.  The Jacks of trump (the Bowers) are also an interesting gameplay element, as they can change their value depending who wins the bid and sets trump.  

Spades is still my game of choice, but Euchre is a fine game to play when you want a faster, tighter game, and it's still better than Bridge

If you're not from the Midwest U.S., then you probably didn't grow up playing this game. It's good fun, but entirely based on luck once you have the basic skills down. The only true skill in this game is knowing when to gamble.

The only downside is the grey area that comes into play with "table talk." Two people could easily cheat at this game if they were so inclined.

I gave it a 6.5 because I've played it so much, it's not a "7" any more, but not quite a "6" either.

I really enjoy partnership games, I don't have this game down but I like to play it, even though we often play with random partners and my partner ends up frustrated that I'm usually the worst at the table.  It's just a simple trick taking game with some push your luck elements.

[b]In Standard 52-Card Deck[/b]

If [b]Spades[/b] is a more complex variation of [b]Hearts[/b], then one could say that [b]Euchre[/b] in turn is a slightly more complex variation of [b]Spades[/b], adding to the bidding, partnership, and trumps with an alternating trump and solo-play option.

I am hesitant to call it "better" than [b]Spades[/b], but I will say that it's heavier on strategy as there are fewer cards so the bidding has to be more precise.

If there are 2, we play Cribbage. If there are 4, we play Euchre. That is the way of things here. Amen.

To give you an idea of the ubiquity of this game in the Ottawa Valley: At a regular party, having nothing whatsoever to do with gaming, and despite the host's best efforts, Euchre foursomes will spring forth spontaneously, in multitudes, like Starbucks in a metropolitan area. 

When I moved out to Vancouver for seven years, Euchre was the secret handshake between Ontarians - refugees in a world of "Why do you want to play indoor games? Have you seen the mountains? The ocean? Who cares if it's raining - go outside!". Oh, and the Newfoundlanders knew the secret handshake as well - sly devils.

I played a lot of this during my college days, particularly when I co-oped in with Dow in Midland, MI.  It was a lot of fun, and I still enjoy it immensely.  Granted, a LOT of the game depends solely on the luck of the deal.  However, there is room for skillful bidding and play.  The game also plays wicked fast among those who know what they are doing.  Truly a game that some will not enjoy as mush as others.  For me, though, it is a winner.

Ezzel a több, mint 150 éves játékkal csak most sikerült megismerkednem, de megérte. 5 ütés van körönként, ebből kell 3-at vinnie a szemben levő csapatot alkotó játékosoknak. A csavar az adu megválasztásában van. Az osztótól balra ülő vagy elfogadja a felcsapott adut vagy passzol. Ha elfogadja, akkor az osztó kapja meg a lapot és cseréli a kezéből, amire szeretné. Ez a jó kis mechanizmus könnyed gondolkodásra serkent és az 5 ütés ellenére élvezetes kis játékot kapunk. Tetszett, több játék után még pontemelkedés jöhet.

Might have rated 6 or lower for own personal taste, but its social play-ability and unwavering devotion by Euchre players is unrivaled... I have to give it a 7 based on the rabid play of Euchre purists when faced with being in the presence of a Euchre novice.  Fanatisism and ease of entry (in spite of gauntlet-style initiation) counts for at least a point!

It can still be enjoyed across varied levels of novice-ship and even at many early to mid-stages of beverage consumption.  It's a true game.  It's fun.

Although I don't live in the Midwest, some of my family does, so it's a given that I have to know how to play Euchre. It reminds me of a simplified variant of Spades, which I haven't played since I was little.

RATING: 7.5
This is my personal favourite game to play with just a deck of regular playing cards (or at least almost half a deck of cards - if I tried to play with a full deck, people would be wondering if I was playing with a full deck, if you know what I'm saying) and 3 other players.  It has a lot of strategy, a fair bit of risk-taking, a little bit of bluffing, and a mysterious co-operative element in the partnership aspect.  I don't know a thing about Bridge, but I seem to think that Euchre shares a few basic elements with it, and for some reason I keep wondering if I'm going to end up becoming a Bridge player when I'm old and grey.  But that's not at all relevant to my review of Euchre.  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 3.5/5  Total: 7.5/10

RATING: 8
My brothers-in-law from Wisconsin taught me this game. They tended to avoid playing with me till I reached a certain tolerable level of skill, but now I'm accepted at the table. I get the feeling that after a few thousand hands of Euchre, players start to recognize the card patterns so playing is nearly rote. Still, I'm not at that point (plays in the hundreds, not thousands!) so I enjoy the game quite a bit.

RATING: 6
[Poker Game] {Card; trick-taking, partnership; optimal 4p} Euchre is a traditional trick-taking game with partner.  It is quite original - 5 cards per hand, option to play alone and the determination of the trump suit.  I will occasionally play it when I played too many Oh! Hell.

Really like this game. It has sort of a Cribbage feel. Not in gameplay so much, but in that you can do really good or bad based completely on the hand you get dealt, but there are enough nuances to make it feel really original. I just don't rate it higher because there are better trick-taking games, but this one is truly a classic.

I played hundreds of games of Euchre during my deployment.

It's a solid game but after learning Sheepshead it's clear Euchre has some real flaws (I often refer to Euchre as the "Fisher Price" version of Sheepshead).

You need exactly four players for the game to play well and as soon as all players know the game inside out it really plays itself.

Quick four player trick taking game.  There are much better games to play.  The fact that you only have five cards in your hand would make it a good game to use to introduce tricks and trump, but the whole left and right bower stuff makes this confusing when I teach it, even to people that have played hearts previously.

When I began playing euchre last year, I had dismissed it as overly simple and luck-based, which can mostly be blamed on the fact that I rarely got a decent hand. However, after only a few dozen games, I can see how much fun this game really is. The luck swings keep it exciting, which the rules are simple enough and there are enough subtleties to keep me fascinated with the game. The partnership in this game is what keeps it so exciting for me, as one of the best experiences in gaming is playing not only for yourself, but also for your partner, who either wins or loses the game with you. The fact that all you need is a standard deck of cards is also a huge plus. As a light game, the only downsides of euchre to me are that it requires exactly four to play, and that the game is virtually unknown outside of Ohio and Michigan.

Don't really care for this one.  I used to play a variant called Buck Euchre quite a bit in high school, but it was more of a time-waster than anything.  It was the game that you would play if all you had was a standard deck of cards and you didn't want to play the more interesting (and more complicated) [gameid=13123].  I'll play it if it's appropriate, but I'm never going to suggest it.  Unless maybe I find myself back in high school study hall again.

It is practically a requirement to play this game living in Michigan.  I have played this game probably more than any other single game in my life time.  It is a fun trick taking game.  There is enough strategy to keep it engaging to me but is not as complicated as something like bridge.   I think of it as the "blue collar" trick taking game.  A working class card game.

Hard to rate traditional card games since the rules vary greatly, but to me this one feels like watered-down Pitch. It's not so much that it's bad; more that there are much better options out there if you have a deck of cards.

My all time favorite 4 person card game. Born and raised in the MidWest, this was the one game that all my relatives knew and liked to play. Found similar enthusiasts in college.

Lots of randomness via the cards, but the hands are short. And if you play with 3 others who know the game cold, Euchre can be played at lightning speed. (Always scrap the 5th trick if it is pointless). In fact, having a 5th person shuffling and dealing the next hand can not be recommended high enough.

I will always play Euchre.  The game is like family to me.  Sure, it isn't the best game ever, but I'm a Euchre fanboy.  I do think it is the best trick-taking traditional card game besides bridge, and I'll defend that to the death.  The game beats spades hands down.

A very popular trick-taking game here in Indiana. (I jokingly call it, "The royal game of Indiana.") You can tell you're in Indiana when everyone's standard card decks have the 9's through A's a little more worn than the other cards.

I'm not really very fond of Euchre, prefering more complex games. However Euchre's ubiquity makes it very accessible and unthreatening to non-gamers here. Thus, I play, but try to talk the non-gamers into other games.

RATING: 9
This is a rating for the 6-handed variant (2 teams of 3, a deck of pinochle cards).  The best card game I've played throughout college and whenever I get together with my friends.  Lots of player interaction.  We talk about strategies and the "should haves" long after a hand has been played out.

The 4 player standard version would get a score of 3.  I hate it, it is not fun, more like an exercise.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.2
There just isn't much fun in this game.  With the very small deck of cards, if you have a good hand (i.e. fairly homogenous), then your opponents are more likely to have them as well.  It's better than not playing anything, but I just don't find it particularly enriching, challenging, or satisfying. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
After 100+ Plays: The four player game requires almost no thought after you learn the basics of good play.  But it is a good social game for exactly this reason.  Six player bid euchre is much more interesting (and one of the only traditional card games I know that can be played with 6)

This trick taking game leaves me cold.  The thought process and gameplay are not interesting or involved enough to keep my interest even when drinking.  I'd much rather play hearts or pinochle if I wanted to play a trick taking game.

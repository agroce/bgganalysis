Sin duda el mejor de la serie Panzergrenadier. En mi opinión los juegos de la serie Panzergrenadier se podrían calificar como buenos juegos frustrados, o en otras palabra, juegos mediocres o aceptables que podrían haber sido muy buenos. 
Los motivos de ello son los siguientes:
A.- Por un lado los mapas hasta ahora han sido malos. Por un lado, su diseño es deficiente o simplista: por otro lado su ejecución también deja mucho que desear. Así en "Bulge I" y "Beyond Normandy" las colinas carecen de cualquier apariencia de relieve al estar diseñadas simplemente con las curvas de nivel. En "Beyond Normandy", "East Front" y "Road to Berlin" el color amarillento es espantoso. Tampoco resulta atractivo el efecto plastilina de las carreteras y setos de "Beyond Normandy".
B.- Por otro lado los escenarios de los juegos de esta serie también han tenido algunas carencias, aun reconciendo obviamente que en todos y cada uno de sus juegos hay excelentes escenarios. Sin embargo abundan los esceneriuos con demasiadas fichas y tableros, que limitan su jugabilidad; o con excesivos turnos, casi interminables; o con un  playtesting deficiente; o sobre todo con infantería sola, cuando resulta aburrudo jugar sin tanques.
Todo ello queda subsanado en "Elsenborn Ridge". Los tableros son bonitos, los mejores hasta ahora, y con un diseño general bueno; las colinas tienen relieve; los escenarios resultan tremendamente atractivos, con situaciones muy interesantes, abundancia de tanques y muy jugables por el número de unidades y espacio para el juego. 
Con este juego la serie alcanza realmente la mayoría de edad. Pero los enemigos acechan. Está a punto de ser publicado Panzerblitz II, con una apariencia impresionante. Y muy atractivo para quienes empezamos esta afición hace casi tres décadas con el venerable Panzer Leader de Avalon Hill.

Perfect intro box for one of the best WW2 games out there. Maps are great, scenarios are brilliant! 

only minuspoint I could find: the scenario book is printed on rather flimsy paper. Go figure!

If you are looking to get into PZG, this is the first box to get, you won't regret it.

Despite that I have many of the games in this system, I keep struggling with it.  It's nothing in particular, but the sum of a pile of little things that bother me, though scenario design is a big part of that pile.  Much depends on the particular game box played, for some reason.  Still, I have issues with the LOS and Spotting on hills.  If the publishers would just fix the issues these present then I think the games would be very good, actually.

Airborne (Introductory Edition) and Elsenborn Ridge are probably my favorite of the games in this series.

Note: apparently there is a 4th edition rule, and a new series of boxed games, but I have looked into them.

This system got off to a rocky start, but over the years has really come into its own with newer rulebook revisions. It's second only to ASL in the variety of units and scenarios available, so it stands alone as far as platoon-level gaming goes.

Elsenborn is one of the best boxed sets in the series. Lots of scenarios, many of them good.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Best game to start in the Panzer Grenadier system; the scenario mix is pretty good, too.  Even the all-infantry scenarios have a lot to offer in the way of tactical puzzles both players must solve.  This is the best platoon-level tactical WWII series system, IMHO.  Rivaled only by the NATIONS AT WAR series, which takes a different design approach.

RATING: 9
I have to give Elsenborn Ridge a solid 9. With lots of small, fast playing, tank heavy scenarios Elsenborn Ridge is the perfect game for newbies and players with little time to spare.

Lots of interesting units types, like M12 self propelled artillery guns, King Tigers, Nebelwerfers, German half-tracks armed with 75mm and 20mm guns, and much much more.

The maps are a big step up from earlier games in the series and look very nice, though they are a bit thinner than previous maps.

Overall Elsenborn Ridge is the best game in the PG series yet and is a great option for anybody entering the series with it's smaller scenarios and variety of units.

I will update this comment latter, but it's a perfect 10, what a great package at a great price. P47's, German Nebelwerfer (NW41) Rocket Launchers, M-12's, Tiger II's, M36's, four fantasic maps, excellent scenarios, what is not to like in this great addition to the PG Series!

All the scenarios are 1 to 4 mappers, so they all fit on my gaming table and they are a very nice mix. This is one of the better ones.

After playing about 8 scenarios, this still one of my favorite games in the series.

Avalanche is finally getting this system down, both
rules-wise and graphically. It's fun, pretty easy to get into, and fills a niche between tactical and
operational. My only complaint, in Beyond Normandy the counters were too thin, in Elsenborn Ridge, the
counters are okay, but the maps are a little thin. Here's hoping that Cassino finds both counters and
maps of a durable quality.

One of my favorites in the Panzer Grenadier series.  Excellent maps, good mix of scenarios with many medium length, combined arms slugfests that work very well with the PG rules.

More Panzer Grenadier goodness. What you expect... decent art, series rules plus scenarios. I noticed that the cardboard is half as thick has older titles. Hmmmm. But the good thing about Panzer Grenadier... you learn the rules once and you can dive in pretty quick.

RATING: N/A
A place to begin with the Battle of the Bulge.  When I play the battle at operational level with quite a few of the other wargames, I always notice this ridge.  I am not a Bulge fan but this could lead me into knowing more about the battle, at battlion level presumably much more excited than at the operational level.  The paradrops in PC game Company of Heroes are so fun!

One of the best titles in the series. Really nice map graphic, good mix of counters and scenarios. Sufficently small to be carrier almost everywhere.

RATING: 9.5
Many smaller scenarios make for an easy play.  Still lots of interesting situations.  The Twin Villages get fought over many times and St. Vith shows up as well.  Both sides get paras, there's SS (2nd and the Hitler Youth), and the usual odd US armor.

RATING: 5
Lengthy set-up and play times mar an otherwise entertaining game.
I like the system, although as many people have said it is fairly 'bloodless' in that it's far more likely a unit will suffer morale loss and break than actually take a step loss from casualties.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The maps are flimsy, the German SPW251s look like those half-tracks that haul guns (can't recall what they're called). The towns on the maps are drawn from a perspective so they look odd if the maps are placed sideways. Some of the US Infantry look like HMG counters.

I feel a bit disappointed with this, though I am going through a sort of PG exhaustion after hundreds of plays of a series that has served me well so take this with a pinch of salt.

(three weeks later...) I wrote the above during a week of bad toothache. To revise: The maps are beautiful in their depiction of wooded hills etc, though I still feel the towns are a bit silly. I really like the specialist SPW 251s which are a welcome component in any motorized (armoured) infantry battalion. The scenarios are good and there are some interesting SSRs. Overall - considering the price - a very nice addition to the series and superb for newcomers. Much better as a gateway into the series than Airborne.

RATING: 6
The rules are fairly clearly written, and the game works OK, so I'm glad I tried it... but compared to some other tactical WW2 games, e.g. Combat Commander or Band of Brothers, it's slower, and for me there wasn't extra benefit for paying that price of slower play.

After playing 4 times, I paused; I don't rule out playing it again, but I personally prefer the gameplay of CC and BoB. Fighting Formations is a bit more comparable to PG (in terms of game length which I wish was shorter), but I also prefer FF's system.

I can see why some players enjoy Panzer Grenadier. E.g. the leadership system (with random leaders at the start of scenario), and the huge number of scenarios and games available in the PG system.

System just seems sort of flat. Maybe more plays will make it better.
Now that I understand the system better I enjoy it much more. Lots of scenarios make this a winner.

WWII Tactical combat at the platoon level. PanzerBlitz for the 21st century. Great looking graphics on colorful oversize counters depicting the troops, tanks, artillery, and aircraft in the fight. Beautifully rendered terrain maps - most games have a set of geomorphic maps, some have full size map sheets. The rules go PB one or two better; overall they are simpler - it's a different kind of combat system - and it adds leaders and morale factors absent in the older game. Tons of scenarios in every game - this games scenarios expand on the 'Battle of the Bulge'.

3 plays in, and I can wholeheartedly recommend this module as a must own!  The size and time-to-play of the majority of the scenarios makes this a PERFECT 1-evening game.  Reading through the scenarios shows them to all be very interesting, and my opponent and I are eager to get further in.

for full-disclosure, I'm the map artist, but have nothing to do with the actual design or development of the scenarios--I just honestly think these are some of the best designed mid-sized scenarios for PG.  great stuff here!

Update, we've played more than half of the scenarios now, and my rating and opinion of the gameplay here stands.

New winter maps have been added--they're available separately from the APL website!

RATING: 10
Definitely the best value in PG.  For $40 retail you get a variety of the meaty combined-arms scenarios excels in, with finely-balanced victory conditions and plenty of heavy metal (at least on the German side!)  The gorgeous maps just complete the package

The scenarios tend to be a bit dense for my taste,  but there are just enough small and medium-sized scenarios to keep that from being a problem - really, my complaint about most of the game's 40 scenarios not being to my particular taste is just indicative of how spoilt for choice we PG players are

One of the best PG games yet, marred only by being on a section of the war that I'm not that keen on gaming... Good scenarios though, and lots of lovely hardware to push around the maps. Personally I think the maps are a bit too ornate, though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Some really fantastic map art (especially with the optional 'winter wonderland' maps) finally gives us a PzG 'Bulge' game that matches the counter art quality!  The scenarios in this one frequently take place in smaller, focused scenarios (more than half, IIRC, are single-map); although unit count in these can be high.  So it's better for small play areas, but does not make a HUGE impact on play time.

I don't rate many games on BGG, but this one is as good as wargaming gets so it gets a 10.  Great components, proven system, good mix of scenarios.  If you want to hog wild, spend a few extra bucks and get the winter maps.   

Also, with regard to the comment below on solitaire-ability, this game plays extremely well solo.  Most of the Panzergrenadier games/modules do; the exception is a number of scenarios with hidden Japanese units.

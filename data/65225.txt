You have to accept this game where it is. It's a romp with cars - shooting each other, running things down, smashing up. You can take it or leave it at that. For me, it's alright fun. Nothing I would call to play, but would be willing to sit through. I would not play it again with more than 4 players - it simply takes far too long for what it delivers back.

Some novel mechanics, in particular the use of the cards as health was interesting.  The theme of running over innocent pedestrians is either a slight plus or a major negative depending on the crowd.  I could go either way, personally.  

I thought the game was a little too clunky for my tastes, but with the right crowd and a better handle on the rules I could see times when this game could provide a novel gaming experience.

Very fun game. Simple rules, quick turns, tons of theme. The driving is less of a dice fest than Formula D, but the comparison is obvious. Throw in a little Twisted Metal and the formula is complete.

Played 6 Player.  Very long for what it is, with a lot of downtime.  Should balance with people in the lead killing civilians and people in the back blowing up competitors, but it doesn't work.

Has a rich get richer problem, if the person in the lead can get ahead of the pack, and doesn't have to worry about combat, very little will stop him.

Also has an issue with people falling behind and being unable to catch up, going through the motions for the 2-4 hours game session.  That's just not fun.

Biggest advantage is it's a cool concept and a fun theme.  As a 30-60 minute experience it'd be a lot more fun.

A very fun racing game that doesn't take itself too seriously.  The theme may put some off, but for those less squeemish, you will find a ton of fun in this game. Card advantage plays a big part, but with some careful planning and frugality, this is easy enough to manage.

This game deserves a better ranking than it has on BGG. It's a lot of fun. I suspect some of the ranking downgrade from the community is based on the theme of killing pedestrians. If that bothers you, then don't play the game. But from a mechanical standpoint, it's a solid game. Lots of dicey back-stabbity ameritrashy fun, with people whooping and hollaring throughout the game.

RATING: N/A
Is this game good? Probably not. Certainly don't attempt to play the full-length game, which is grotesquely over-long. Even the short game is too long, honestly - I'd recommend playing just 8-10 tiles is probably plenty unless your group is really into it.

Still, there is some fun here. As a game design, there is a lot to like, including the wholehearted embrace of the gratuitously violent theme. The tile specials, weapons, minis, etc., all nicely play up the comedically-violent theme. The game system itself is clean and plays smoothly. But the pacing is just not tight enough - too much fiddling with reading and discarding and drawing cards for not enough action, I think. And there are some production problems, with the space separators not always clear and a lack of clean references.

I think it'll keep its spot in my collection for its quirkiness and gratuitous violence. For one more play at least. But any game where you get points for running over children is going to have a narrow niche to begin with. When there are pacing issues and it goes on too long, you're further constraining an already pretty constrained audience.

If you're in that audience, though, you should give it a try. Just please don't play more than 10 tiles your first time out. Also, probably best limited to 4 players. 5 or 6 gets a bit crazy from both a downtime and congestion standpoint.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A really fun idea for a game (racing while running people over and destroying other cars), with some humor and neat ideas incorporated.

However, the game just seemed a bit slow and plodding, and seemed to drag too much for a racing game supposedly packed with people smashing and car shooting action.  If gameplay could somehow be sped up, it would definitely kick the game up a few notches.

As it is, it's a decent racing game if you want to add a little "take that" action to a racing game, and add in the goal of wrecking stuff and killing people as you race.  It just ends up feeling a little less action packed than I would expect.

Red Pedestrian minis are missing!
Basically, like it or not depends on how you involve to the game play and what your gaming group is.  It's an American style game but the theme is so crazy.  I like its driving simulation with considering the conservation of momentum during collision and its acceleration methods.  I'll not give a very high mark to this type of game but it is also a good game if you can play it with the right group of people.  Playing this game with crazy guys is the best!  If you can find a group that can play unrestrained, wild, involve, "not too math and logical" and with a sense of crazy, it's worth to take.

In addition, the rule book writing of this game is hilarious and funny.
Last but not least, I can't find a reason not to buy it with HK$88 and it was recommended by my colleagues.

It's Road Warrior or Mario Kart as a board game. Good good stuff. The best part is the ability to remove the road behind you as long as the slowest player drives off it, which keeps it very compact on a table. What's also amazing is that almost every problem or danger is completely your fault: you either took that corner too slow or too fast. That really ups both the game quality as well as the ability to trash talk. Fantastic as both a beer and pretzels game, as well as a strategic work if you're focused like a laserbeam.

Likes: The theme is politically incorrect and ethically wrong. That can make things hilarious.

Dislikes: The theme is politically incorrect and ethically wrong. It takes the right group for this one. It seems kind of easy for one player to run away if another player gets stuck and blocks the rest of the group. Also, there just is not enough pedestrians left for the ones that are lagging behind and seems to be a win more game.

RATING: 6
One solo play of 3 cars, 8 tiles plus start/finish. Also, house ruled that player draws 5 cards after wipe out. Took +1hr.

I can understand the issue that the game may be slow, but it didn't seem too bad. Will still consider this when I play with others. I did have an issue of frequently forgetting how many spaces a car had moved out of their total allotment. Since some sections have many crash checks and pedestrian rolls, I frequently found myself recounting the spaces I had moved after rolls and discards.

We played with 6 people, all new to the game, and it just slogged along.  After 2 1/2 hrs of play we pulled out the finish tile & ended the game early.  If we have a lot of people again, or new people, we will cut the road tiles in half.  I don't mind long games, but this one just bogged down. We need to be heavier on car combat because getting those extra cards is important.

I like the mechanic of accessorizing the car.  I think crash check is well put together.  And I love the dashboard.

This game is random (no surprise), but in our game it seemed impossible to not get blown up constantly by the other cars over and over again. Not much fun. The race was taking way too long, and the rules were not well-written, leaving us with many questions.

A fun and simple game, light on thought, but nicely self balancing, as the leaders tend to targeted and knocked to the back.  A neat feature is in combat the attacker sucks the cards out of his target's hand.  Run out of cards, your wiped out.  But also be reducing the hand, the leaders options are seriously reduced.  

Being in the back is not a bad thing as long as you can stay in contact since weapons mostly can only fire forward.  But you miss picking up bonus points for clipping Peds.  

The game is long, but this is simply solved by reducing the deck of tiles, with no real adverse effect on play.

RATING: 7
First play went from me loosing to pulling out a victory as my flaming ball of a wreck passed the leaders and limped across the finish.  Awesome!  I was in last place, with a bad mix of weapons and accessories for the first 1/2 of the game.  Fortunately with the "basic" rules you're never really out of the game.  I was able to score a few big peds for points, AND in the last curve take another 50pointer, bump my speed just enough to be the new leader, and play a "pass" card that let me get around the other cars.  I lost 4 cards in two devastating curve checks to make 1st place.  I was now 2 spaces from finishing the race 1st.  With no cards left, I was easily blown to pieces, but that only caused my first wipeout.  With my speed down to 20mph from the wipeout, I was able to accel to 40, and still win the race.  I couldn't have won without the 100 win bonus.  

Overall the theme could be considered dark if you lack a sense of humor.  Nothing about this game is serious or realistic, and that includes the theme.

At first, I thought it was really hard to catch up.  Then I realized that with cards like nos, orbital death laser, and sniper, you can still get some +10 tokens from the back and try to disable people in front of you.  There's still not a great catch up mechanism, but getting a feel for some strategy helps tame that flaw for me.

However, the game takes 2 hours, and for the amount of luck and dice rolling, this seems a bit long for me.  I will probably try a rule of randomly throwing out 4-6 tiles and then shuffling the finish line tile into the bottom 4.  This may cut things down by a good 20-30 minutes and make the length more reasonable. 

Aside from that, you get to run over children and shoot each other.  Great fun, lots of backstabbing, but don't play it with people who are sensitive!

Wicked theme, lots of fun. Car racing, vehicular combat and customizable cars, I love it! There is no player elimination so nobody sits out. New players may take a bit longer to take their turns as they learn how to handle speed, crash checks and their hand of cards. I recommend using only 10 tiles plus the start and finish tiles for new players to keep the game short (within 2 hours).

Un juego fuerte en ambientación con un lenguaje crudo. A través de una carrera de carros se intenta matar y atropellar la mayor cantidad de peatones, también se ganan puntos por atacar e inhabilitar los vehículos de los contrincantes. En el juego se roban cartas las cuales se pueden utilizar para armar el carro, atacar transeúntes u oponentes, munición o acciones especiales. Lo interesante esta en que la cantidad de cartas también representa la vida, entonces es prudente medirse en la cantidad de cartas que se juega en su turno.

Paso a ser uno de mis juegos favoritos tal vez por el tema y su fuerte lenguaje, algo que lo hace diferente y difícil de encontrar en otros juegos de su tipo o hasta ahora no conozco alguno similar.

Driving blindly into new track sort of sucks. My game group seemed overwhelmed by the hand management, which is weird because they'll play way more complex games. I think its a funny take on the racing game. It's most certainly Deathrace 2000 the board game.

Pretty decent filler game, but not likely to see much play. Not engaging enough to be a main game, but a playtime is a little long for a "end of evening" game.

RATING: 5
Theme: Death Race 3000 ripoff
Gameplay: Roll dice, play cards to customize your car & attach other players, murder pedestrians.
Components: The track is just okay, but the Pedestrian minis elevate everything.
Replayability: There are far more streamlined racing games out there that'll get to the table before this one, but they usually don't incorporate murder. More's the pity.

Initial rating: 4.5 (September 2012)

As I like Carmageddon (videogame) a lot, I was keen on trying this game. At first, it appeared it was a very good game, (at first) but at the end I was sorely disappointed. The game is gorgeous and the theme is great, however the gameplay and (most of all) the play time leave a lot to be desired.  The game can take hours to play, if I play a long game (which I don´t mind), it needs to have low luck  and very interesting decisions, also it has to be a lot more entertaining. Road Kill Rally is TOO LONG for what it offers.  In general I dislike racing games, but the theme gives this some positive points. It has a lot of uncontrollable  luck with the cards and the dice (a deal killer for me) .

On the good side I like the gorgeous components and art.

Perhaps with 3 or 4 players the game time can be shortened but I’m not willing to try this again.

Bottom line, a light game in decisions, but heavy on play time. I don’t think I will play this again, I will do my best to say away from this one.

Road racing with a twist: you get added points for each person you run over, with extra for grannies and scouts -- with success and failure determined by dice rolls along with added damage for speeding or hitting hazards along the way. A nice mix of problems to deal with and good mechanics, I find this game a bit slow to start and not really pushing the vindictive competitiveness something like this should have. Still, you got to love a game that lets you run over granny.

BIG PLUS: original mechanics, uncontrollable damage
MINUS: limited road tiles means the experienced have an advantage

How dare a game with cars and guns be so horridly abysmal!  Has just about every flaw a game can have:
- Runaway Leader
- Runaway Loser
- Overly Luck-Driven
- Unbalanced Cards

All this would be forgivable in a 30-minute filler, but in a 2+ hour game (with 4p)?!?

To top it all off, it commits the unforgivable sin of racing games...it's SLOW!!!!

So sad that this game was so forgettable. The absurd theme interested me. I'm a fan of the classic Death Race 2,000 movie. Road Kill Rally, however, just lacks excitement, pacing and depth. It's a slow plod of hand management and space counting, while causing "damage" to other vehicles that is little more than a speed bump. Not fun.

I'm totally on the fence about this one.

For one: You must play this game with the intent of trying to eliminate each other (optional rule).

Two: There are some odd situations that can end in uneven pacing and an overly long game.

Fer Three: Doesn't play so well with 5-6.

The rule book is also a mess.

I do love the idea that this is a smattering of Car Wars and the best of Carmageddon.

Edit:

Gone, baby, gone. I guess future contenders like Road/Kill or the reprint of Car Wars will perhaps suffice.

This one is pretty fun, as long as you use the shorter game found in the rulebook (just involves placing the finish line a little closer to the top of the tile stack.)

RATING: 2
DO NOT WANT.

Seriously, some people may enjoy this as a "light beer and pretzels" kind of game, but I did not enjoy it at all.  Don't get me wrong, I don't mind the theme, but between the randomness of the cards, and the dice, and the dice, and the exploding dice, and the dice, and the road tiles (just a little bit), I did not enjoy this game at all. 

Unlimited damage potential (exploding dice) against a very limited resource pool (rally card hand) makes for a rather dumb and brutal combo.

Also, the rules are not well written and leave a lot of gaps.  The symbols are wording is also confusing at times.  Sometimes the color of a splotch matters, but sometimes only the number in the splotch matters, and sometimes the number only matters if a different color matters for something else.

Our five player learning game took over two hours.  If it had been 30 minutes, it might have been tolerable, but I just found it to be a miserable slog.

1 play, 5 players.

RATING: 6
A game with a dark theme reminding me of Death Rally and Carmageddon.  The way you control the cars and fire your weapons are interesting, but I feel like it's way too luck based up to the point where the gameplay feels the same since the high risk makes players do very predictable things.  Lots of little nitpick rules as well.

I've used House Rules to shorten the game and make more interesting choices, surprisingly it became a better game.  I've posted on the Variant Forums on what rules I use.  With my variant rules, I would say an 7, without them a 6.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It's a dice-fest, but while there are a lot of variables that can make an individual play un-fun for one or more players, the game overall is a blast. Dripping with theme, embraces just how wrong its is, great bits, lots of clever mechanical touches.

Some oddities, too -- like, it seems best to hang back, and going fast doesn't seem to earn you enough to mitigate the risks. But still: hella fun.

After some distance from my first and only three plays, though, I realized it never comes out because it's too long and fiddly for what it is. This is a 30-minute game that takes 90 minutes; I hate that. Sold.

This is a game not dissimilar to the very similarly named [gameid=1578]. Sure the track is done with tiles not the cards that get played and they have obstacles and "Carmageddon-like" pedestrians to kill, but it's pretty much the same game. It even has that same you can't win from the front unless you happen to draw the [-]box canyon[/-] sniper rifle issue.

Still, with four players it's a blast - though with six I feel that it outstays its welcome.

Play can be a bit slow the first couple of times, but once you get over the poorly written/vague rules this is a good piece of Ameri-trash.

Clearly inspired by the old 70s cult film Death Race 2000, players compete for victory points by winning the race, blasting each other to pieces and running down -that's right- old people and children! You can't get offended about it when its just following its source material.

Being knocked out of the race is optional meaning there's no need for player elimination. Huge piles of upgrade and event cards keep the game chaotic to the last moment. Lots of dice rolling too- control freaks better stay clear of this one! 

On the downside it can draw out to a very long game depending upon the amount of screwing going on, easily topping over 3 hours in extreme cases! Its also prone to king making, run away leaders and lucky winning sprees which has dragged my rating down to an uncomfortable ride of 4.

Playing it again recently left a sour, unpleasant taste. Its simply too long and drawn out with my group- its a racing game, it should be quick and exciting! When I looked up and saw a bunch of bored faces, one person lying down ignoring the game completely and another checking Facebook I finally realised this game just doesn't work as is.

This game could rock if only it was tidier, less fiddly and quicker.

RkR is full of dark humour as the drivers attempt to run down pedestrians, fire weapons at the opposition and manage their speed as they race their way to the finish line and avoid obstacles in the process. 

This one just goes too long for what it is. There is some good stuff in here but ultimately it is a miss for me and I should love this, being a fan of Freeway Fighter (gamebook from the 80s).

Silly, fun game, but very campy. Taking out pedestrians is a little odd, and the fact that you roll dice for everything while being able to strengthen everything by discarding cards doesn't make for a very good design. Still, there are worse racing games out there.

finally got to crack this bad boy open and do a 3 player game. It was fun but I felt like it overstayed it's welcome. The artwork on the cards is atroceous, but I think it adds to the personality. Better art though, could still emphasize that personality. This is carmageddon the board game. I feel like this game could benefit from max player count. I'm sure it would be a romp that way.

RATING: 6.5
I was actually surprised at how not terrible this game was. You were required to balance speed on turns with risks on hitting pedestrians, and you are also required to manage your hand well to balance extra dice when running people down to their usefulness in other capacities.

Of course, like most games of this design caliber, there are unfortunate things that take away from the fun of the game. In this game that's mostly that the cards are imbalanced and the PVP combat is sort of wonky. The most grievous sort of imbalance in card games like this are where there are cards which cost the exact same thing but one has a clearly stronger effect than the other. For example, there is a card that you can discard to avoid 5 damage, and a card you can discard to avoid ALL damage. The exact same cost (just the card itself) but one is decidedly better. There are also a lot of cards that are clearly better but not nearly as easy to compare.

Fans of Crazy Taxi or Twisted Metal video game franchise may find a similar vein of fun here. One is in a race along tiles that are revealed as the race continues in vehicles you soup up and retrofit with weaponry. Sure, you could target other cars, but you can also turn your vehicles and weapons on the bystanders who happen to be on the street for your "Cannonball Run".  Art is lighthearted and cartoonish, and the humor is as much a part of the game as the race strategy of when to lead, when to trail, and deciding on upshifting vs downshifting like in Formula De.

It has everything I want in it from this kind of game, but I fear that it just doesn't offer enough real decisions.  It is so straightforward that I just don't see much room for clever play.  The cost of the die is so extreme, and pushing your hand and speed back up to a competitive level is so achingly slow that you never want to take extreme risks.  

I feel that everything that the mechanics in this game attempts to do, are done FAR better in Nitro Dice.

It is just way too slow for what it is (especially when you are rolling on every space you move into).  A shame that it is so cludgy.

Have played two games with 3 players.  While it has averaged at 90 minutes which seems long for a 'Crazed Destruction' game, it never felt long.

Similar to Talisman, the game is more about moments experienced, then positioning of pieces.

An example is when my son came zooming up on the tail of my wife's car. He was loaded for bear with an anti-tank gun.  Regrettably he forgot that she had a machine-gun mounted on a turret, (cars can generally only fire forwardly).
My wife unloaded completely on him, removing all his remaining ammo.  He tried to return fire, instead he was left sitting there saying, Click...Click...

Road Kill Rally is an odd misfire from a publisher known for the best artwork money can buy.  The concept is tailor-made for 10-year old boys, but I wouldn't buy it for them because of the theme.

i was bored with this game after about 30 minutes.  turning over the next tile was supposed to be exciting.  instead it was really "ho hum"

This game was hilarious.  It was also surprisingly balanced.  Some of the components are pretty nice, others look and feel like they wrote it in.  Not enough variety in the cards, so halfway through the first time playing you will have seen everything.  Definitely a keeper, regardless.  Running down elderly pedestrians while attacking your friends' vehicles?  Yes please.

Kind of surprised how little respect and demand this game gets.  I saw it on Amazon for 16 bucks and figured it would at least be worth that, it turned out to be even more fun than I thought.

It's actually fairly clever mechanically.  There's lots of dice rolling, but most things really require some planning to manage, like your speed, and attacks are all hand management and push-your-luck decisions.

It has just the right amount of "take-that", since I hate games that are pig-pile on the leader too much, but I love when you can trash-talk people as you screw them over, and seek revenge.

Will say that it went a bit long, especially with more than 4 players.  I don't really like when games have sequential phases to go through, and this game isn't an exception.  There's also some over-powered cards for sure, and also some pretty useless cards, could have used a bit more tweaking.

2035 - The Road-Kill Rally becomes a worldwide phenomenon, attracting contestants from throughout the world. Ratings exceed three billion for the Rally Cup Finals, making it the most watched spectacle in human history.

As a driver in the Road-Kill Rally, you are racing against opponents eager to destroy you with guns, rockets and flame throwers. But the big points come from scoring pedestrians: running them over or blasting them out of the road. After all, you have three billion viewers to satisfy.

Think of this as Car Wars meets Death Race 2000.

RATING: 5
This is basically a boardgame version of Death Race 2000. It plays smoothly, although having to make a speed check after every single space of movement is a little tedious. Still, it's more fun than I expected and I'm a little surprised the game didn't sell better. It's unfortunate, because if there is one thing the game could use, it's some expansion boards.

Sweet! It's Death Race! Won in a charity auction. Fun, but definitely not for everyone. The rules could have been better written. Those with a dark sense of humor will enjoy it.

Fun racing game.  Formula De meets Death Race 2000.  I concur with suggestions to move the finish tile into the last 8 area to keep the game from going too long.

A racing game with a deadly theme, but it just takes way too long for a game where the mechanics don't really evolve at all as you play.

Entirely too long for what it is, and especially for what it isn't: tense, deep, thrilling, etc.

Our game certainly didn't feel like a race.  It felt like a crowd of 3rd graders with dangerous weaponry trying to squeeze past one another in a narrow hallway.

Played 2 shortened games. Lots of laughs. Once everyone understands the turn order it goes pretty quick. There is some down time with more players because you have to think about more enemies. I would do learning games with 3 or 4.

Game is a dice-fest of fun.  Couple of cons though...1)It plays a little long for what it is, 2)A bit fiddly rules.

Neither of the cons are too serious though

A good idea but the execution is a bit sloppy. We fumbled a bit with the rules so I'd have to see how I felt after a second play. I like the amount of cards and the customization of the cars but the damage you take can be kind of crazy and slow the game down.

RATING: 7
a good theme for a road race, and one that is appropriate for the silliness of the actual game.  running over children may not be the party line, but in this game it will net you 30 points!  The take that aspect is high, as in most offensive race games.  The accessory cards are varied and fun, but if you are stuck with all of one color it can be a pain.  The track are a brilliant addition, that add flavor, theme and action with different abilities and bonuses or threats on each one.  Easy to expand.  It is a fun game.

I had high hopes for this game since I usually like Z Man Games and I used to love Car Wars.  However, I found that using cards for car "hit points", being able to fire vehicle weapons, being able to roll extra die for hitting passengers, being able to do misc actions, avoiding damage during curves, etc. was extremely artificial and gamey.  Not having enough cards or not the right cards led to too many dull turns where this felt like Formula De (which is not a good thing).  I also was disappointed that you had little opportunity to custom design cars other than the cards you drew.  Too limited ability to attack sideways or behind you.  By being forced to drive along a 2 lane track, you had limited ability to maneuver and attack other cars other than just being in front or behind somebody.  Pedestrians way too difficult to kill.  It plays very slow with 6 players (3+ hours) with lots of downtime.  I would much rather play Car Wars than this game.

Clunky, overly-long gameplay, which often drags on for 2+ hours. 

Far too much randomness. A combination of heavy unbalanced card management, dice rolling, road tile drawing and more dice rolling doesn't leave much in the way for any skill or thought.

Not exactly a speedy race game. More a slow, cramped, luck driven, jostle around a track.

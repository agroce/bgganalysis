A worker placement game, but one where you cannot really plan the actual result of your placement, especially when planning to hire someone. The chaotic player order system makes it almost impossible to plan unless you stick to buying and selling goods to gain majorities in guilds while using opportunity hires when you can. This strategy allowed me to win both games I played so far, but they way I won just doesn't feel right.

Light worker placement game that has significant limitations on what you can do each turn. Unfortunately, it is this limitation that certain workers will not have anything basic to do, much less about productive options. 

Production is excellent will fantastic euro game pieces. Beautiful art and boards make this a very friendly light euro game for the family. 

Nothing challenging unfortunately. An exercise of basic options.

Buy stuff, earn victory points, rinse and repeat for rather too long.  Players in our game rapidly learned that everyone playing all their workers in a single round led to altogether too uncertain outcomes.  However, round after round of single worker placements makes a dull game even duller.

The production quality of Norenberc is fine, with chunky wooden tiles and wooden bits. However, the cutesy artwork was not to my taste.  The character icons could have been clearer too.

Trading game in medieval Germany. The rules are simple and the components are great. The game takes around 90 minutes and all scoring happens in the end. Its a good game mechanic-wise but the theme is dull.

Gestion de recursos y compra y venta de articulos.

Muy divertido y facil de enseñar y jugar. Con mas intringulis de lo que parece ya que hay varias maneras de puntuar y no siempre estara claro si comprar mercancias, si venderlas o si es mejor adquirir un visitante de los que se hospedan en cada gremio.

Buenisimos componentes a excepcion de las monedas, demasiado diminutas.

Con la variante de dos personas más la variante oficial de los prestamos mejora una barbaridad y me encanta jugarlo en pareja.

This is the surprise game in the list. While only getting an average rating of 7 on BGG, we found it to be great fun. The auction mechanic is simple but you must make many meaningful choices and there is lots of room to develop strategies. The theme doesn't sound too exciting at first sight but throw in some pink cupcakes and that is all of the theme this game ever needs!

Played with 5, the game dragged quite a bit, and was slightly out of control at times (there were some huge swings in turn order in places). But the mechanics seemed interesting, if a bit abstract - the theme is rather pasted on, cool resource meeples notwithstanding. 

Have no further interest in playing with 5, but could try again with 3 or 4, as I was left with the feeling the game would be much better.

A játék jó, de hosszú (4 személlyel tiszta játékidő 3 és fél óra volt). Végig ugrattuk egymást az AP veszéllyel, a holtidő sajnos nem kiegyenlített, így előfordulhat, hogy valaki 20-30 percekig üldögél, ha már elfogytak az emberei, miközben a többiek az esetlegesen dupla annyi emberükkel végig aktívan játékban vannak. Én nem éreztem azt, amivel riogattak többen is, hogy kiszámíthatatlan a játék, és A, B, C, D tervvel is rendelkezni kell, szerintem közel sem ennyire káoszos a helyzet. Lehet, hogy csak azért, mert végig nekem volt a legtöbb emberem, de az esetek többségében elértem a célom, és ritkább esetben voltam elszenvedő fél. Ezzel nem akarom azt mondani, hogy a sok ember az egyetlen lehetséges út, már csak azért sem, mert majdnem 4 emberrel nyerte meg egyikünk. A sokféle pontszerzési lehetőség korrigálási esélyt biztosít akkor, ha valamiről lemaradunk. Ötletes, igényes, és szép játék, amely az akciók számánál elég nagy szabadságot ad, ezáltal tág taktikázási lehetőséget, de annyira talán nem kiugró, mint amennyire sok időt elvisz.

Norenberc is a game with wondeful components, so I really wanted to like it. It is the third game by Andreas Steding I tried, after the wonderful Hansa Teutonica (my game of 2009) and the enjoyable Firenze, so I had high expectations.
In the end, the gameplay is far from innovative (it is a "simultaneous worker placement" game), felt quite dry and perhaps dragged a bit. The game is not bad, but lacks some sort of tension and is a bit repetitive. I'd like to retry it, anyway, with 3 or 4 players, to consolidate judgement.

Beautiful game with a lot of decent gaming material. The rules looked good and the first round I was in the right mood. But then began the frustration : why can you steal from others, why are there 2 guildmasters at the end of the fourth round. These and some other things changed my mind and now I must find a good reason to play it again. I hope it does change my opinion in a positive way.

First play and scored a 7 owing to the fact that we played with variants to the rules and a complete misunderstanding over how the victory points were allocated. As a result, I really have little appreciation over how the game should be played but the mechanism seems fairly unique and involves quite a bit of brain burn.

I'd like to play again by the standard rules just to appreciate how this should run.

A good game which played a fair bit longer than its advertised 90 mins first time out. Seemed to get bogged down a little in AP towards the end.

Aside from the fiddly setup and take down it is quite a neat, elegant game, balancing trading for cash and resources against building up points. Both Ben and I went for men at the start but this seems not to be the key to the game.

Turn order is very important and the set up makes changing this quite difficult in the first round, so coming out of the hat first for turn order does seem to make a fair difference.

Therefore a few quibbles, but none the less, this is a nice, enjoyable, well-rounded game.

I liked this game quite a lot on my first play, despite being absolutely killed at it. It has a nice, bold, chunky graphic style, which I liked. There's quite a bit going on, but it's still quite light in terms of gameplay. The mechanics are nothing revolutionary, but they work quite nicely together. There is a simple market mechanism which actually works quite well. Would be happy to play again.

Juego de colocación de trabajadores, pero no en la forma habitual. El tablero es modular y cada módulo contiene el edificio de un gremio de artesanos. El jugador debe escoger en qué gremio influenciar colocando su trabajador y escogiendo entre contratar a un visitante, comprar o vender mercancía. El juego se compone de 4 turnos y cada turno consta de varias fases. En cada fase, el jugador escoge qué gremios va a visitar y la fase dura hasta que todos los jugadores han visitado todo lo que pretendían. El turno finaliza cuando a nadie le queda ningún trabajador. Es un juego en el que planificar tiene sus dificultades, porque hay mucha, pero que mucha interacción entre los planes de uno o de otro. Al final de cada ronda, el jugador que haya conseguido más puntos de artesano se lleva al maestro artesano y el escudo del gremio. Los precios de compra/venta de productos van cambiando de un turno a otro. Al final se evalúan unos cuantos factores, con especial importancia la situación en mayorías dentro de un gremio, conseguir todos los gremios y conseguir escudos.
Es un juego de bastante planificación y en el que además, hay que adaptarse a lo que van haciendo los demas, que puede (y seguramente lo haga) interferir con tus planes.
Muy bueno. Adecuado para jugones con experiencia. A no jugones les puede resultar espeso o demasiado sesudo.

A bit of a disappointment after Hansa Teuronica by the same author.

Although the main actions sound quite elegant (buy, sell, recruit), there are quite a lot of little things to forget.
I think 5p is a b it much for this game, as the overview suffers a lot.
Two times 6 types of majorities (goods and people) are quite a lot to have a look at.

Dry as bones. It was technical and without any player tension.

The most boring game I brought back from Essen 2010.

A solid analytical game that I enjoyed but found pretty mentally taxing to play well. There are many considerations and tradeoffs, mainly revolving around turn order and making a profit. I think that I respect and enjoy this sort of game, but the deep focus required to play it well makes it a game that I doubt I would want to play very often.

Initial rating a 7.

My initial attempts at playing this game were hampered by lack of understanding how the economic system worked, and ignoring where VPs were to be hand. Consequently they turned into arduous affairs where I always seemed to be running out of steam halfway through: no more money, seemingly hopeless shield and guild member position, too few meeples to play with compared to the opposition. But then I started thinking about the game, and concluded that my approach had been rather wrong. You can read the long story of what needs doing [url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1469352/dealing-apparent-harshness-norenberc]here[/url]. In short: do what I wasn't doing, and take it more slowly. The funny thing is that all of a sudden the lack of control I'd been perceiving seemed to vanish to rather unremarkable levels too. 

So, for the moment assuming that the game continues to behave as it does: Norenberc then contains a clean albeit somewhat contrived economic system. Unfortunately it's also a little difficult to say how well you are doing compared to the rest of the players: comparing all the guild members in front of them is a bit cumbersome; and consequently keeping a running score as well. But there's no denying the simple rythm plus tricks to make use of turn order effects. Upgraded the rate by several notches, with room for further growth if the game keeps up its good behaviour.

Way too chaotic for the amount of brain-burning players dedicate to this game.  Because the turn order can change so easily/frequently, and players going ahead of you can really change your options, there didn't seem to be much long-term strategizing.  Played once with 5 players, and there was way too much downtime, as players placed only one worker at a time and overanalyzed their turn.

This game deserves a lot more love than it gets.

Norenberc is a game of guilds, guild craftsmen, guild resources and townspeople who use the guilds' lodgings. Winning is determined by who best controls how and when they acquire or use each of these things.

The simultaneous action selection mechanic works exceptionally well here. There are many very interesting and deep decisions. However, the game is actually relatively easy to learn.

The components are superb; even the box is thick and super-heavy. Very nice game.

Deploy workers to buy/sell goods or they can purchase tiles.  Not your typical worker placement game though.  Has an extra dose of nastiness.  You are competing for majorities in goods to get the freebie craftsman at the end of a round.  There are some tiles that let you steal resources from another player.  It can get pretty chaotic.

Extra workers seem pretty important early on.  This means going first is essential for guild that offers a craftsman with a worker.

The game felt a little El Grande'ish to me...which is a strange thing to say for a worker-placement game.

Update: Actually going last on turn 1 is better unless the extra worker tile winds up on the brewery.  this way you can change order in the guild right before the extra worker.  Tempted to bump to a 7.

2015-07-28 : In essence a combination of an area majority game with set collection where every decision you make is crucial - and you have to take about 20 of those in 2 hours, which is just about the right amount.

Simultaneous area selection ensures smooth game-play and very little downtime.

Like a lot of people, I was quite excited about this one as it came on the heels of the designer's major oeuvre, Hansa Teutonica. However, my one play of this wasn't memorable, and I haven't sought it out since. I played with 3P which I thought worked fine but heard that 5P was dreadful due to the chaos introduced by players changing turn order.

The game is really about three things: ROI optimization, getting additional tiles, and turn order. It's really quite simple, and success is in how well you can speculate on the buying and selling of goods. The novelty is that we all don't place the same amount of workers each round; you can hold some back for the next round if you anticipate it will benefit you. The turn ends after the round when all workers have been played. I liked that novelty, but it's not enough to carry the rest of the game, especially the randomness of how the tiles come out.

RATING: 5
The centerpiece of Norenberc is the very simple premise "buy low, sell high." Money is fairly tight, so knowing when you can let an opportunity to earn some go and acquire guild members or townsfolk with your valuable goods instead is one of the major decision points in the game.

If that doesn't sound overly exciting it's because it isn't. The buying and selling gets repetitive very quickly, and completely breaks down when the (randomly distributed) guild masters form a cartel and set the same prices all over town. And since there are no alternative paths to be found, early high prices with sharp drops later also put quite a bit of sand in the gears.

Interesting take on worker placement and majority games. I liked the way things inter-meshed. Theme didn't really take.  Lovely bits.  Needs a reference scorecard.

RATING: 4
My rating is based on a 5 player game. While the game material and the mechanism of buying and selling goods is really ok, I have two issues that are responsible for my low rating. At least in a 5 player game the first player (and even second) have a big (too big) advantage compared to later players. They get the best resources and then are buying the best persons (craftsmen) before you. The only way to break this is buying a useless person just to become start player yourself. So you are punished more than once just being a later player. Another problem is hoarding. There is only the "Thief" which may pick two goods from a player. If the thief is not in the game which is easily possbile then there is no solution for this. Furthermore in a 5 player game it's hard to plan because there is some chaos in it. Not all pictograms are that clear but this point does not affect my rating.
Maybe with fewer gamers it plays better (more balanced).
[i]Edit:[/i] it turned out that a rule mistake led to this bad experience.
The players did not receive one good of each type at the beginning.
This would have had an impact on chosing what to do in the first round! So I have to try again. My rating therefore is likely to rise soon.

Perhaps the very essence of the modern Euro: simple mechanisms leading to over-complicated majority and set collecting scoring. A few issues: the 'extra man' tiles are very powerful and you want to grab them in the first round or two. The start player may have an undefeatable advantage here and any player getting ahead in actions will probably win. Second, look ahead is very difficult with the rotating turn order so you just play tactically. I'd play this again, but winning needs luck as well as skill.

Kind of a stock speculation game: buy low, sell high, unless you want to turn stuff into points or compete for having the most of the goods.  Components are very cute; it's hard not to love little wooden cupcakes and boots.  Game is lackluster, or maybe it's just not my kind of game. Not too interesting in any case.  (1 play)

Lighter than I had expected, but still packed with interesting decisions.  This is mostly tactical game.  HIGH on interaction.  Timing is extremely important.
It's not very original game, but the fun you get, easily compensates for this.

The most puzzling element of the scoring is a 2VPs bonus for the 30+ value of craftsmen in a guild.  It seems unrealistic.  Maybe it's possible to achieve it in a 2-player game?

This is a very interesting game that at first seems like a neat little set collection game, but turns out to be more about diverse collections. Enjoyed playing, the rules are straight forward and the play time isn't too bad, however at times I felt stuck or limited, but am certain that was just poor planning on my part. Overall good game.

I was pleasantly surprised by this game, since my expectations were really low due to its lackluster post-Essen (2010) reception and subsequent rejection by Z-Man.

The theme is definitely very pedestrian and almost nonsensical (especially regarding the caprices of the guilds), but the mechanics are sound and make for a really tricky game where money is really tight and very important.

Hopefully we will be able to play enough to remember the rules, as only familiarity and increased speed of play would give it a chance of a rating increase.  It's just too hard to distinguish from many other games.  Though the cupcakes help.

A nice combination of mechanisms centering around worker placement. Many ways to score points, but in the end the winner seems to be decided mainly by craftsman majorities and crest collections. Most plays probably tend to be really even as it is hard to really lose ground on any type of scoring or at least you're going to make gains on another type. I can't see Norenberc having any specially lasting impression, but I'm definitely happy to play it especially because of the good production, nice looks and relatively quick game time in relation to the depth.

this game was more liked by my friends than with me.
I thought it was too random (very little control) . we played with four.
I think this will be better with 3 Hence I give it the benefit of the doubt and give it a 6 instead of a five. I'll try it once more with 3 players only and if that doesn't work it can leave

A variable set-up game trading game.  # of players, +1 guilds are set-up in the game.  Players take turns mapping out what guilds they will use actions at.  At a guild you can buy their goods, sell your goods, get special guild persons, and another choice or two.  The game boils down to wisely spending your money on goods and abilities so that you can turn that into more money.

The game was very tight and I believe there is a lot more to this game than I had seen and understood at first glance.  It is a pretty brilliant and simple trading game that eludes its deep strategy in simplistic rules.

Just writing about this game right now makes me want to play it again and really figure out how to play it correctly, rating moved to 8.

My favorite game discovered at Essen 2010 so far... Classic in appearance, but original in gameplay. Andreas Steding does really games like noone else (I know and own so far Kogge, Power&Weakness, Hansa Teutonica and Norenberc): we may like them or not, but they are definetly differents (for me in a good way)!
Perhaps maybe not for 5 players (I like the control you have on 3 players game).

[EDIT] Played a lot at 2, 3 and 4 players, and gave the max rating. Thanks Mr Steding for such a game!

I was quite wary about the simultaneous action selection after reading the rules but it is not an issue at all. There are lots of exciting timing issues to consider all the time, which makes this quite an interesting game. 

There isn't anything especially ingenious, though, so the game does not really rise above its peers. The end scoring seems a bit too biased towards crests and craftsmen majorities, which are pretty much the same thing.

Very nice production.

Another Euro of playing 4 rounds, using semi-blind worker placement to buy and sell resources. Semi-blind in that there are 5 areas to go (+1/-1 depending on # of players) and each turn you can only go to each area once because the worker allocation is done by playing one worker on top of the one card you have representing the area you want it to go - and then all revealing which cards they'd played under their workers. So if you want to go to the same area multiple times, you have to do it over successive turns, making for timing pressures which are neat. If you want to go to different areas, then you can choose to do them on the same turn, or on different turns. There's pressure to go first into areas to get the cheap stuff, but you also want to drag your workers out over as many turns as possible, 1 a turn, so that you can go lastish to determine exactly how many resources you need to get first in a guild this round. This provides some interesting choices, and the semi-blindness creates some tension without the usual frustration that blind-bidding can create. So once you get in an area, you can buy the resources native to it, or sell them if you need money to buy resources elsewhere. The price of each resource changes each round, and you have full knowledge of what each resource price is going to be throughout the game, so you want to play your buys/sells to maximise profits. Buy cheap this round, sell dear the next. But everyone else can see the same opportunities, so part of the charm is to determine which resource opportunities to compete for. Whoever's got the most in each resource at the end of the round (ie when all workers have been finished placed out over successive turns) will earn points in that resource's guild equal to the resource cost that round, because at end of game, there's VP's for first, second, third in each guild. Your other option is to use a worker to offload these same resources not for money but for tiles that will either give you a power or add to your resource guild tallies at end of game. The bonus VP's at end of game encourage you to have won each guild at least once over the four rounds, so players move their focus around, selling what you were strong in, investing in the next area you want to go to, while the previous owner there offloads and goes elsewhere ... or maybe not! Which makes for a bit of a merry-go-round effect, with your aim being to try and pick what you can win with least competition whilst still making enough money throughout to be able to buy the next resources you need. It's very Euro, very dry, and somewhat repetitive, very much watching what other people are doing and are likely to do, trying to determine what's the best way to acquire and then spend those resources - powers, profit, guild points - to maximise your VPs. I was engaged throughout - you need to be because people's resource positions are continually changing and that's part of the charm. But it's probably not a game I'll go seeking simply because there's no story arc - just do the 4 rounds and then add up all the VPs at the end across all the various ways. Did I mention very Euro?

I bought too many games that year in Essen so I never had time to try this, others in my gaming group did, so when I was ready to try it they were done with it. I finally talked some people into trying it. The guy who know the rules said We would have plenty of time to finish it even though we were short on time. Only the rules explanation (which was quite bad) took half the time we had, but we still started. Of course we didn't have time to finish, even though we rushed as much as we could. The end result was quite a bad experience and I will for that reason probably never play this game again.

In this game, you're trying to buy (or sell) goods, or trade them for merchant tokens.  Much of the scoring comes from majorities in the various types of merchant tokens at the end of the game.  The price of goods changes from turn to turn in a way that everyone can see, so you might stock up on cheap boots in one turn knowing they'll be more valuable in the next.  Each turn had multiple rounds in which players may or may not play, which I thought slowed down the game more than anything else.  I knew what was going on, but I found it hard to wrap my head around this game.  Didn't really enjoy it.

This is a majorities game where you are constantly pressured to ruin your majority. The general idea is that each round, every type of good will give a scoring token to the player who has the most of that good. You desperately need money to buy more tokens. The way you get money is by buying tokens cheaply and then selling the tokens when they get expensive in future rounds. Not only that, but you also spend goods to buy powerful character tiles, and at the end of the game the player with the greatest sum on their character tiles of each type gets bonus points.  With too many players, this game gets chaotic, because you have to always keep an eye on what other players have, so keep the player count small.

A potential issue with the game is that it's both incredibly tight, and also extremely unforgiving of a mistake, to the point that the fun can be sucked out of things.

A lot of games have a similar feel to Norenberc and the mechanics here aren't ground-breaking (set collection, simultaneous actions, etc.) however i'm not sure i can name a game that mixes those elements as well as Norenberc does.

There's just something about this game that tickles my fancy. Maybe it's the classic style art or silly cupcake tokens. Or maybe it's just an overall great game.

Norenberc is an inoffensive game of timing and market control. It's easy to play, yet very difficult to explain and give meaningful instruction to new players. My only concern: that each guild functions too much alike (51st state syndrome) and placing workers is a little hand slappy.

The theme is a little thin I guess, but I didn't find that annoying? It's a market game. So buying and selling goods and hiring craftsmen didn't feel out of place.

I hate explaining games with convoluted and numerous end game scoring and Norenberc has it in spades.  Once folks have played the game and gone through a scoring round, I think they will have a better handle on it, but that means playing a 2 hour game first just to get that answer. And will players enjoy the journey enough to play it again?

An average Euro for today's (2010) standards.  Dry and a bit long and seemingly over mechanical.  When we started out, I enjoyed the play on this…   worker placement and hidden choices are things I enjoy.  Unfortunately the timing and mechanics on Norenberc are off.  The game progresses slowly and actions don't require too much decision making.  You can plan for a strategy, but must be tactical in case someone ahead of you in turn order is planning similar moves.

I also felt that the tiles that provided another worker (adding a potential 4 more to your base set of 4) were far too random and overly powerful if you were able to grab them.  There are also 'moon' tiles that can be VERY fortunate in the beginning.

While I did like the bits for this one, and even enjoyed most of the mechanics, the game felt stale quickly and the point grabs and general scoring process were frustrating by game end.

Complexity does not equal depth of play. 
Complexity does not automatically equal a great game. 

Tried to play, but it was needlessly and awkwardly rules minutiae heavy for a game that was simple set collection at its heart. 
I committed the unforgivable sin of quiting a game before it was over.  Heck, we had only completed the first round. 
The components were beautiful, but the game was NOT.

RATING: 6.6
A quite fun and pretty medium to medium-heavy euro with many ways to score points. For me, too many - as scoring happens at the end of the game, it's next to impossible to recognize the leader during the game and act accordingly. While the theme is definitely present it's a bit far-fetched, with the mechanisms and actions we take making not much real-life sense. Adding it all together, it's not my type of game, but it's still a very good game nevertheless - if what I said doesn't sound as flaws to you, you're very likely to like it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
In my opinion one little tweak would refine this game nicely: The last player left in a round to place meeples (after all other players have passed), must place all of their remaining meeples on the next turn. This slightly reduces the power of a player acquiring more meeples, speeds up the game slightly, reduces tediousness by reducing the number of single meeple placement turns, and makes the game slightly less chaotic.

Hey, White Goblin Games -  could you make all my games? Fantastic pieces and presentation. Absorbing gameplay, but it doesn't bog down and plays quickly - faster than the 90 minutes on the box for three players. The rules are easy, but you need to make sure you're playing the right way - I've heard about some people playing incorrectly.

It'll be played differently from game to game as different craftsmen and townspeople come out. You can plan ahead and work on your strategy with this one, but you also have to react to what your opponents are doing. Maintaining cash on hand, or a quick source of cash is essential to be able to react to opportunities your opponents open up through their own devilish plans. I found there to be a nice, mid to high amount of interaction between players where timing is important. There's tricky ways to squeeze more money out of the system and clever moves to be pulled off.

I'd probably avoid playing this with five because of the loss of control, but I'd have to try it out first to be sure.

I'm liking this more than Hansa Teutonica. It's a little bit similar with the multiple ways to score and the need to get yourself another agent early. Like Hansa Teutonica you can approach the game in different ways, usually depending upon what your opponents are doing. A good game from 2010.

Már a szabály olvasatakor is megtetszett az ötlet. A játék témája nagyon jól jelenik meg a játék alatt. Kereskedőként a régi Nürnbergben próbálunk minél nagyobb befolyást szerezni az ottani kereskedőcéhekben, azáltal, hogy kézműveseiket megszerezzük, termékeikkel jól kufárkodunk és megfelelő városlakókat győzünk meg, hogy mellénk álljanak. A játékmechanizmus jól működik. Érdekes, hogy csak 4 körből áll a játék, mégis nagyon hosszúra nyúlhat, sajnos ez nagy gyengéje a játéknak. Azt hittem a Vasco de Gamánál nincs gondolkodósabb, AP veszélyesebb játék, hát kérem van. A Norenbercben hihetetlen sok lehetőséget kell számbavennie a játékosoknak főleg ha sokan játszanak. Minél többen ülnek le ugyanis a játékhoz, annál több kereskedőcéh van jelen és ezáltal a lehetőségek száma csak nő. Meglepve láttam, hogy 5-en egyáltalán, 4-en se nagyon ajánlott BGG szavazók szerint a játék, én egyenesen azt állítom maximum 3-an érdemes leülni hozzá, ha nem akarnak a játékosok 3-4 órán keresztül játszani. Számomra a 4 játékos parti is nagyon hosszúra nyúlt, ha valamely játékos a sok munkás stratégiára, más a kevésre megy rá, elképzelhető, hogy a kevesebb munkással rendelkező akár 10 percet is vár a jól eleresztett, munkásokkal bővelkedő társára, ez szerintem nagyon rontja a játékélményt. Érdekes, hogy a négy lehetséges akció közül az egyik változtatja a játékossorrendet körön belül is így a játék kicsit kaotikus lehet, ezzel egy-egy kigondolt stratégia is dőlhet. Van a játékban stratégiázásra lehetőség, de főleg taktikai játéknak érzem emiatt. A játék kivitelezése hibátlan, gyönyörű, hatalmas faelemek, nagyon szép céhházak és kézműveslapkák. Öröm a játékra nézni. Máskor is leülök a játékkal játszani, de biztosan csak max. 3-as partira.

RATING: 5
Tepid and overly worky set collection game.  There is something that is going on in modern euros that I'm just not enjoying all that much.  The trend seems to be that you have to go through tons of work to get something of an engine up and running to get to a point where you can finally take turns that are worthwhile.  

So what happens is that you spend the first part of the game where you try to ramp things up and score a bit along the way. The first person to get up and running (while scooping up VPs along the way) gets an advantage at the end game; when the heart of the system is exposed and you actually start playing.  All of these designs feel ponderous, and in most cases, I just end up wishing that the game were half as long and that the designer would have just started the game at the sweet spot with everyone on a level playing field.

Norenberc is the perfect example of a bloated, overly repetitious, high work for little return, modern euro.  It works fine, but if this came out in 2000 it would have been boiled to its essence; half as long and twice as good. 

The worst part about this game is that I won without doing anything particularly clever or insightful.

I did like the cupcakes though.

This game was a long hard slog through a big math problem, but that is not necessarily a bad thing.

Andreas Stedding is a designer I appreciate. I like his designs which are always heavy enough for my tastes and the decision making process is often clever but also quick enough - I'm thinking of Hansa Teutonica particularly. Norenberc is a dense euro game settled in an economic ambience and with a few ambiguos choices. Players try to maximise their money in order to get the best chests and the best characters. In the end there's a majority check in each one of the guilds. A simple worker placement game but with lots of AP and by consequence lots of down time also.
I didn't dislike the game and I think it can be better than a six if (only IF) we can manage to downsize the time of play which was over 2 hours. Too much time!

A very nice game with some great tension filled decision to be made.
It feels a little mechanical and repetitive but still a great time.

So, I played a 4-player game of this, and two of the other players hated it so much we quit after 3 turns (out of 4).  I thought it had some interesting stuff in it -- you have a lot of viable options, and you have to choose the thing you think the other players will let you get away with.

However, we severely undervalued the tiles that give you extra workers - well, three of us did, the other player was able to pick them up, and he ran away with the game.  At least one player at the table thought this indicated a runaway leader problem, but I'm not convinced.  It's possible that if all players are correctly valuing those tiles, the problem will go away.  I'm willing to play it again to find out, we'll see if anyone else is...

Interesting trading game that is not, as some comments here suggest, a dull exercise in "buy low, sell high". One of the main ways to gain victory points is to acquire a guild's crest by having the most of its goods at the end of a round -- so you want to hold on to enough of those "sell high" goods to maintain a majority. This is complicated further by prestige crests, which go to the guild with the highest sell-price. Better yet, selling takes one of your (rare) actions: like every decision in this game, the decision to sell is agonizing.

But despite the trading mechanism, the meat of the game is in turn order manipulation. Each turn, each player chooses X workers and X guilds to visit. These are resolved in order: all players at the brewer's guild, all players at the cupcake maker, and so on, in turn order. This repeats until all players have used all of their workers or passed. This is a fun exercise in brain-burning "macro-level" turn order antics -- you can choose to use all of your men visiting four guilds in one go, while another player uses one worker over four separate turns, depending on what you want to do and whether you're worried about someone else doing it first. But it's also a game of "micro-level" manipulations: at any guild you can change your position in the turn order, e.g. to go first at the next guild visited on that same turn. Agonizing!

I love how Norenberc feels; what I'm not sure about is its strategic depth. Every turn is highly tactical, and the townsmen add just enough randomness to derail many inter-round plans. The hidden information inherent in simultaneous action selection adds chaos. On the other hand, future market movements and all player holdings other than money are open information.

The biggest problem is that scoring opportunities are very sparse, which limits options for strategic differentiation. Prestige crests are too valuable not to fight for. Valuable townsmen appearing at the right time can be excessively useful.

I'm very surprised that the three player game is rated the best here, because the scoring is pathological -- you're always going to get at least one point for being in third place for each guild, so point spreads are lower; it's trivial to get the five point bonus for having one of each; and the prestige crests are far, far too valuable. It's even more broken with two, for obvious reasons. Five is more chaotic, but workers are sparse so there are more opportunities in the early game. Five runs longer (more likely 120 than 90 minutes) but it's worth it.

I had worried that extra actions would be decisive, but that appears not to be the case.

Some of the variants suggested here are interesting. I like Scholle's suggestion of forcing the last player to use all remaining men at once, which speeds up the final turn and slightly reduces the advantage of having more workers than anyone else. My idea is to modify the "Do Nothing" action: you can take your worker back by paying coins equal to the workers on the roof (or maybe one plus the number of workers). The aim is to encourage people to play more workers per turn by lowering the risk of being locked out -- taking them back can't be free or the action will be over-used, but a small cost. And every player count needs a different scoring matrix.

First play dragged a little (5 players, all newbies, exploring actions, 2h). Initial 'buy low, sell high' assumptions tested by seeing that some goods were only going to get cheaper. We took a while to really pick up on the idea of spending goods for guests. Lots of interaction, but (with 5 players) it sometimes seemed too uncontrollable. High potential for AP-prone players to completely lock up.

RATING: 4.5
The components are amazing, but the gameplay leaves a lot to be deserved. It can get pretty complex with all the interlocking trading systems and has a lot of problems in gameplay.

Run away leader is a problem in most economic based games, but here it is really bad. Early game mistakes can grow to really destroy your entire game.

Might have to play it again now that I know what to do, but when one person has almost as many VP as everyone else in the game combined (53 or something), something is flawed.

The second new Stedig game to come out this Essen, after Firenze. A good friend who's taste I trust told me this is a very good game and it turns out he is right. Lots of competition for resources and stuff, great turn angst. The theme is very dry, but it plays well and I'm glad I got this.

I made a few missteps in the first round when led to me playing pokey loser the rest of the game; it's all good since we tend to treat first rounds with a game very lightly. My husband really liked it and I feel I need to give it another go now that I have a better grasp of the strategies before I can give a final verdict.

Just one play and the rating is affected by the fact that I was effectively eliminated from the game after two rounds or so. It might've been my fault and a result of my poor play but still it's very unforgiving - a game can be unforgiving but there should be some kind of comeback mechanicms. Instead, I ended up sitting bored and doing nothing for more than an hour. 

What happened was that I did't have any money (1-5 at most) and had only very few (cheap) resources. I couldn't by any people because of lack of resources and therefore I couldn't get any money. I could've sold my resources but I wouldn't have had more than 2 or 3 money from them so what's the point since I've already bought them at that price? When I couldn't buy any craftsmen, I was almost last in player order from which resulted that everybody else had a chance buy the cheaper craftsmen from under my nose. 

After that I was eliminated for more than one round and if game has four rounds, it's clear that there's no point in playing anymore. There are some decent mechanisms (except for the market) and some strategic possibilites but with 5 players Norenberc is hugely chaotic and the game itself is quite dry and unnecessarily heavy. Probably better with 3 players.

RATING: 6
Norenberc is fairly interesting, but perhaps a bit too chaotic for my tastes. I especially did not enjoy the mystery tiles that are distributed in the final turn, which can radically and randomly change guild majority ownership. Money also is very tight, except for the start player who, if he is wise, will swoop in and scoop up the overly powerful +3 or +5 income tiles. Any player who is not able to increase their number of agents early also will be at a big disadvantage. The game worked fairly well with two and three players, but our group pretty unanimously thought there was far too much downtime with five players. Ultimately, there is quite a bit to like here, but not much to love.

Played once with 3 players. Beautifully produced game (perhaps overproduced), the game has some neat mechanics. Easy to get goods and cash poor, so one needs to be careful not to overcommit oneself and be unable to act near the end of the game as 3 thaler income each of the 4 rounds is not much. Definitely would like to explore this more. The townsfolk add very nice replayability and variety to the game. I have the Essen expansion, so it should help with the replayability even more.

I'm really split on this one. I absolutely loved my one play at bgg.con with 4 players. However, we also played a 2 player game the other day, and it was a radically different experience. There's only three guilds to enter, so each turn it's "yup, beer again". Money was also amazingly short, as once you've run through your initial supply, there's very little you can do to get it back, especially if the price tiles don't align well based on the random draw. This is pronounced with 2 players, as one source of money is the number of workers on the roof of a building when you hire a guy, and with only two players, there just weren't many there. In the four player game, you might get $6 or $7 back when hiring a guy, here it was $1 or $2 at most. We were winning favourites with only 1 good because the other player had to sell off or pay their good, that's how tight it was. I would have called it a 9 before the 2 player game. I think some house rules might improve the 2 player game, higher income each turn, neutral workers on the roof to bump up income, etc.

Rating dropped after second play.  You can analyze your position fairly well, if you ware willing to look at all of the information spread out among the players.  So, the game will definitely favor those that are capable/willing to do it.

Played this one for the first time over 2 years ago. To be honest, didn’t remember too much about this game, except that it was fun, and the great meeples that are in the game (in the shape of the goods that the guilds are producing. i.e. Beer, bread, paper, cloth, boots and hats). Decided to play it again today. As we’re a little bit more experienced today as we were back in 2010, we were curious if the game still would be fun to play. The game takes 4 rounds to play. Each rounds takes 1 or more turns for each player in which he can do 1 or more actions, depending on the number of agents the player has in his personal stock. Setting up the game seems a bit overwhelming at first sight, but once you got the hang of it, it really is set up pretty fast. Just setup the guilds needed (number of players + 1) and mix the leftover craftsmen with the guest (which depend on the number of players). That’s it. A round consist of three phases.

    Each player simultaneous decide how many guilds the sent a worker to or passes. When a player passes, his turn is over for the during of the round.
    Each player  do their actions in turn-order. The guild with the lowest number is called first. Possible actions are:
        Sell goods to a guild for the price which the current guildmaster is showing.
        Hire a guest and chance turnorder.
        Buy goods from a guild
        Do nothing and place an agent at the guild.
    End of round. The guild select their favorite player (which is the player who owns the most goods of the guild) and that players earns the guildmaster along with the guild crest. Each player gets three money. Also the guilds are set up again.

After playing 4 rounds, the scoring takes place. During the game, there are no points at all that can be collected. At this time, their can be collected a few points for a lot of different things.

After playing this game again, it was clear to us, that it was even more fun, than we remembered it was. There is a lot of tactics involved in the game. Sometimes it’s good to be the first player in turnorder, but ofter, you don’t want to be first.  You just want to follow the other players, and see if you can beat them at a guild. This was fun, but it’s an ‘in between’ game. It’s too hard to be a family game, and it’s too easy for a regular player. I guess for that reason, it won’t hit the table very much again.

Criminy, this is tricky and can be brutal.  Money is scarce, scarce, scarce.  The bank is only going to give you 9 Talers that you can use (and 3 more after the last turn, which could affect your score).  Everything else you earn is good, old-fashioned "buy low, sell high".  ...and there are a host of interesting mechanisms for you to jockey for goods that you can use for that purpose, and to directly acquire townsfolk (trying to have the highest total value in each guild), and indirectly acquire them with their crest (and if you're good, the prestige crest for the round, too).  I can't do this game justice with a quick description, but I haven't stopped thinking about it since I played it.  I'm ready to take it on again (and my rating might well go up, now that I've had time to sort my thoughts how to play it).

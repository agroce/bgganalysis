A very fun hide-and-seek game for young children. The delight of hiding the kid from the wolf and the excitement of being found out make it a joy to watch them play.

Gorgeous components and a fun little game. Based on a well known story which makes it easy for kids to relate. Game plays fast and is also fun for the adults.

Kind of fun actually for the kids.  Not much strategy here, but it's a concept they can easily grasp (hide and seek).  Rating 6.

Truly excellent...I did not think it was so funny. Simple hide and seek but for materials and fun is one of the best (age 4-6).

Played for the first time with 6. Played 2 times in a row. We were laughing the whole time. You should definitely only count to 5 as the designer intended. I'll probably increase this rating to a 9 or 10 the more I play it. Great fun. Loaned to Denny.

Great game to play with kids, especially if you put out your big wolf voice and role-play a bit while playing.  The reactions I got from my daughters in this game are priceless.

Rated as a kids game. 

IMO this should be at the top of any list of recommendations for board games to play with young kids. It’s hide-and-seek on a board! One player is the wolf and closes his or her eyes, the other players hide two wooden goats under some pretty impressive cardboard furniture. Great fun with the 5-and-under, or even 7-and-under, set.

RATING: 9
This game is just plain old hide and seek in a boardgameversion. But with only 5 (fast)seconds time to hide, this childrens game becomes hilarious.
Excellent filler. Play with as many as possible. 
Never laughed harder than during this game.

Rated based on playing with children. 

This is a fun introduction to double think games.  It's amazing (at least so far) how much easier it is to win with the wolf than as the sheep.  But the finger puppet is a must, having it sniff around the furniture is a big part of the experience.

One of my first games that I bought to play with my son.  Think it needs 4-5 players though to be fun and you need a good wolf player to get into the character of being a wolf!

This game is ok with young kids, but I wonder how long the thrill will last. I feel like the interrest will fade. Hope I'm wrong.

Our kids loved this when they were younger. A fun game but grows old very quickly for adults. However, have happy memories playing it with them and getting into the role of the wolf so rated it for that.

RATING: 6.5
Very simple game for you children (3-5 years) - the problem is that while super cute and well produced (props for the wolf, which is a finger puppet), it's audience is in a very limited age range. The game is basically a 'game' version of hide and seek that is adapted in the setting of a fairly well-known Brothers Grimm Tale (The Wolf and the Seven Little Kids). That it build on a fairytale is a great value-add for many kids as the theme is right on the gameplay - yet it offers little strategy or creativity even for a kids game.

Fun, simple game that my kids really enjoy.  Wolf sock puppet is a nice touch.  Not sure if it will have much legs, but a current favorite that gets asked for a lot.  Been good way to teach bluffing and misdirection to the five-year-old.

Nice Easter Egg in that the kids are dressed as known characters - Waldo, Dora, Alice, Woody...

Ok wow! This is fun! You totally need to play this with the original rules from the designer in that you count only to 5 rather than 10 and do it fairly quickly! The panic!!! It's a total blast! So much fun even for adults!

Rating based on the joy my "one month shy of being a 4-year old" grandson had playing this.  Seeing the excitement on his face when hiding his kid, and also the trepidation of being found by his great-grandfather, the wolf, was just priceless.  Someday he will outgrow this game, but I will always retain the memory of his excitement and joy with this one.

A strange surprise. A very simple game which provokes plain fun situations. Specially aimed at occasional players, but not only.
I had a lot of positive feedback about how well it works with one adult playing the Wolf and the children trying to hide their sheep. Works best with 5 or 6 players.

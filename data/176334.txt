I love the small box, and relatively small footprint, and the seemingly simple play that has some real decisions in it, but one play left me feeling the normal civ game blues, that military was too powerful and it really just isn't fun at all to spend multiple turns doing nothing because you didn't buy the right cards to protect yourself. I would play it again, but the golden ages is still the civ champ in my book.

later: better at 3p, revised up to 7

Guns & Steel is a sort of deckbuilder, but without all the shuffling.  That's one point in its favour, I suppose.  Each turn you are trying to add cards to your hand with a view to building effective combos and to scoring victory points.  Cards can be played as resources towards the purchase of a card from the central tableau or for their actions.  You place newly acquired cards in front of you action side up and so don’t get to use them right away, rather like adding to a discard pile.  G&S differs from many deckbuilders in its military cards that can be used to attack opponents.  Being on the receiving end of a successful attack can be really detrimental to your chances of winning, so it's essential to pay attention to the balance of military power.   That’s perhaps the most interesting thing about G&S; there are so few cards in the box that I imagine play will quite quickly become formulaic.

The cards aren’t of the highest quality.  The card artwork is quite pleasing and, while each card has quite a lot of information on it, it is all clearly presented.  The box is pretty ugly. The rules are OK, although important details about the value of earth and space resources are easily overlooked.

7.2 is my 2 player rating. I think it's a good game at that player count. More than that though, and it drags down closer to a 1. Down in those numbers you start tossing the word "broken" around, and the multiplayer experience here is the closest I've been to using that on a game.

Interestingly themed resource conversion card game with dual use cards. I like the leanness of the game, I dislike the slight memorisation element and the unexciting card power escalation. One needs to play more than 1-2 games to get the gist of the resource conversion paths and the tempo nuances of military strength calculations. The game has an interesting ebb and flow powered by the "retrieve cards" timings. 

Overall, a solid design, but in need of expansions to carry itself beyond 10 plays or so.

Clever use of cards in a mini game, and the theme is right up my alley. Takes a few plays to 'get' the flow of what is going on, but once you do, you quickly realise stealing victory points with millitary is the only real way to win, which then slants the focus of the game, making this one a pass for me.

It's unfair to call G&S "bad" but it is definitely not for me and I won't play it again. "UNLEASH THE 2!", as the Dukes of Dice say.

PROS
-Card art is gorgeous and cards have a linen finish.
-System of using cards as both resources and for activating a power makes for a design that does a lot with a little.

CONS
-Other than monuments, 0 variability.
-Turn order really favors first & second players.
-Monument VP can make for huge point swings.
-Card ability was just so so.

That's a lot of game for only 52 cards. Maybe too much? Like, I think I wish this game were either shorter, or more exactly to my taste. But it's micro enough that you totally can keep your next several turns in your head while still changing course when someone takes the card you wanted.

A solid little game in the vein of Innovation but with more conflict and a quicker play time.  I was really surprised by the tightness of the gameplay (wonders will not always give victory), the interesting and overlaping nature of the cards, and the different ways that the cards can form powerful sets.

Pegasus rethemed the German version as 'Through the Ages - the cardgame' which is appropriate under the one aspect that ignoring military will be fatal in both games. Stealing a wonder from another player is decisive. Otherwise, Guns & Steel recognizably draws its inspiration from the Civ series of computer games. Most cards have an equivalent in one of the technologies or wonders. Gameplay itself is counter-intuitive at first. Beside the random setup, this card game doesn't have any random factor. With more than two players it could become uncomely for players who came too late for the military and tactics cards. An ok game, I'd like to play the Renaissance version once to see if it improves the experience.

Too dry and too mechanical for me. Personally I prefer games with either a random element or asymmetrical information, both of which Guns & Steel doesn't have. I'm also not a fan of the game's graphical design (good thing it also explains everything with text) or the "turn this resource into that and that into yet another" gameplay.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Dry as hell - and turns can take some time. Yes, you can make some plans when it isn't your turn, but the player just before you might ruin your plan and you've to start thinking from the beginning. I don't feel, that I'm building civilization here. What I'm doing is converting resources to other resources so I could buy cards from the table - and those cards are same in every game (only those wonders might change). So, not my cup of tea.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
FIRST IMPRESSION:

Extremely simplified Civ card game which is minimized to just a few cards which aid in production or fighting. Wonders are available to gain more points and can be fought over and stolen. Game was fine but did not excite and I doubt I will play again. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Initial rating (might go down because of lack of card variety).
Carries the civilization theme very well despite being only a small box card game. Cards have dual usage (face down: resources; face up: effect). Play has interesting ebb and flow because you get your played cards only back to you hand if you have only 1-0 cards left in hand. This is also the only time when you may obtain civilization wonders. Card play is mainly about resource conversion to obtain new and more powerful cards. 
The only downside is that the game could need more cards to increase variety.

Alomst really good, but the monument stealing makes way too big an impact on the scoring.  Probably good players can avoid it with the proper prep, but I often play with new players or we try new games all the time and don't think we get to such a state.  What is more, if you have to prepare in a specific way the game gets too scripted.  Most everything else I liked, although more cards where not all of them are used would have also helped.  As such would play for sure if asked but will not be buying it.

RATING: 8.15
This one is a very cool Card Civ game... there are 45 cards in the game plus 10 wonders (5 of which will be in play) and with this little deck of cards a very interesting Civ game was designed!

The cards in this game have 2 sides, one side is a Resource, the other is a Development and this is the differentiating point of this game.

It's a very very cool game, liked it a lot, just think that it will be better as a 3 player game... as a 4P game it seems a bit too long and too swinging, it's harder to plan ahead due to the interference of more players.

I really want to try this 3P to see it really is better like I assume it is.

Excellent game

The KickStarter campaign from Grail Games was very well run and even delivered early!

Mrs Fish and I played a couple of games of Guns & Steel and won one each. There is a fair bit of depth here and it pretty much fits the bill for a short civ builder sort of game. I anticipate we'll get a lot of play in the future. One fantastic design feature is that the box is large enough to accommodate future expansions as well as sleeved cards. It will be interesting to try this with multiple players, especially as the attack cards target all players when used.

So, another keeper. I hope to try this out with my lunchtime games group at some stage as I'm sure it is the sort of thing they'd enjoy, but it might push the upper time limit just a bit too far. We'll see.

Except for desperately needing expansions, Guns & Steel is an excellent filler game. It really captures the feel of the progression of civilizations, with a heavy emphasis on military. I think there is a lot of room for creative play here, and the different uses of each card is really cool. In many ways, this is a less chaotic version of Innovation. A very solid, if confrontational, filler.

There's some head-spinning notions in the game as it first plays, where each turn you're faced with the choice of which 2 cards you're going to play. One will be for its resource only (ignoring its effect), the other will be the inverse. But then the effect kicks in, and effects turn resources up/down/all around (conversions) so with just a few cards you can derive a wealth of options. Then it's a matter of determining what tech card to buy next (and how its effect will complement your approach) and will you be able to get it before the next player. It's a worthy take on the economic engine genre. My reservation is that the tech tree (ie what to buy next) is too limited to generate serious longevity, but it's not too big an issue for a cheap-ish card game, and worth exploring until then.

Nice idea and potentialy good title, but it suffers from not enough playtesting, I guess. When the player misses the opportunity to buy a card from certain era, he is out of the game. It is almost impossible to catch up with other players at that moment, especialy because you are easy prey for their stronger attacks, while avoiding them is impossible as the attack is always against all the players around the table.

--Jun2015-- I'm very enthusiastic about this.  The first game was engaging; interesting; tightly fought.  I'm a tiny bit worried about replayability (due to the limited set of cards); but, equally, the random layout should enforce significantly different patterns of acquisition.  Very happy to have a copy!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Risen another notch in my rating with further play. Aiming for the right combo of cards and timing it all to perfection is rather fun. The military hitting in the game is really overrated. Sensible play defeats a handful of attacking cards that serve no purpose other than military. A couple of good tactics card buys also does wonders. The card effects match the titles and it's just a very nicely polished title. I find it underrated amongst players who've rushed to judgement after a couple of plays. Their loss.

---------------
What a nifty little game! It takes a couple of slow rounds before those who haven't read the rules cotton on, but after it clicks the pace increases dramatically and light bulbs seem to go pop at regular intervals. Players on occasion proudly announce that we should "check out this turn". Universally accepted around here as a fun little game, I can only fault it for not offering a couple of extra cards in each age for the wonders style variability to be extended to developments. I can't wait to see what they come up with for the anticipated "germs" expansion, but I've already got a couple of interesting ideas rattling around in my brain that I might try out as a fan expansion.

A wonderful little game with interesting decisions, paths, risks and rewards. So much game in so few cards, but maybe not quite enough cards to stand up to repeat plays. This one makes it into the travel games box for further in depth exploration.

1 play, 2er

Elegant, quick-playing civilization-themed card game with a cool, different take on hand/resource management. Cards are double-sided, with one of several resources on the back (corresponding to different ages), and a development on the front. Plays pretty quickly once you get the hang of how the cards work although turns get slower as you go since you have to juggle more and more resources/conversions in your head. I do wonder, though, about how repayable the game is since all cards always come out (albeit in different configurations, therefore altering build costs). True, you get a different set of wonders each game, but there are still only 2 options for each age! 

Very likely fun for several plays, but likely could do with some expansions. Not sure about best player count? Also not entirely positive about the warfare stuff: seems easier to defend, but being able to steel someone's wonder (with the corresponding big VP swing) seems REALLY strong!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
All the cards are arranged in a 5-level pyramid on the table, every upper-level card supported by 2 others. In addition, a random (one of only two!) wonders is placed next to each level. Players start with the same hand of 5 basic resources/developments. 

On your turn, first place a card face down (resource side up) in your personal display. Then, play and activate a development card to your display. Developments have a (small) variety of powers: mostly either produce a resource, convert resources into other types, or reactivate used resources or developments. There are also some attack cards where you total the strength icons in your display and attack every other player. Combat, though, favors the defenders: it's easier for them to increase their defense (by playing cards from hand, and/or flipping resources in their displays to their development side, where the strength icons are present). You can use your resources (flip the cards face down) to acquire a single card from the pyramid display. Cards have a base cost printed on them. In addition, they cost an additional resource (any type) for every card connected to them in lower levels. Acquired cards go to your display, development side up (but NOT activated).

If you have 2+ cards in hand, end your turn. If you're down to 0 or 1 cards in hand:
- if you meet the requirements of any Wonders, you must claim one of them
- retrieve all face up (development) cards in your display, and any resource cards you would like to reclaim (if any)

If, at the end of your turn, all wonders or all Space Age cards (top level of pyramid) have been acquired, the game ends. Highest sum of VP (wonders, all civ cards in hand/display) wins! Tiebreaker = most cards (civ and Wonder) wins.

RATING: 5.5
Light, highly abstract civilization-themed engine-building card game. The core mechanism involves cycling cards which can be played face down (as resources) or face up (for an action). Cards can only be taken back when a player ends their turn with 0-1 cards in hand.

Leaving resources out to save up for more advanced cards can be valuable, but attacks can be disruptive. Timing is quite important too.

Not awful by any means, but a few plays in I'm finding it hard to get excited about. I wonder if that will improve over time -- it has felt like the tempo isn't quite right, but if it picks up with experience then it could work better.

Nice small civ card game. Big flav is that u got same cards every play.

I would only recommend purchasing Guns & Steel if one already owns G&S: Renaissance and wishes to expand the card pool by combining sets.  The additional paths to victory created by the Culture Token mechanic used in Renaissance enhance my enjoyment of the game.  This is by no means a "bad game;" it's just not the one to get, if you're getting only one.

Really neat purchasing card use mechanic.  I love card games where the cards serve multiple functions.  Not a lot of cards in the game, so I'm not sure how many good plays I will get out of it until it starts to feel samey.  2-player was pretty mediocre, but the 3-4 player game is much better.  A good way to spend a 1/2 hour.  Production value is pretty good.

Is there a player order problem? What does the third player do while the others take military and civil strength? How can they leverage the extra resource and earlier "pick up" to get ahead?

I really enjoy playing this, and hope that the flexibility of styles and strategies will help keep it alive and maybe move it up, despite a question of player order and limited cards.

Interesting concept, lots of fun, but I worry about the replay value.

A small civ builder with cards? Count me in. It is easy to transport, but needs a bit more table space than I like for travel games - but if the table is big enough, it is definitely a fun experience. Gives quite a bit of bite during play, for such a small game. Due to the very low amount of randomness, you can easily plan ahead and strategize.

Interesting so far. I have some concerns about replayability, as the different wonder sides aren't going to provide that much variety and, while the ordering of each row certainly affects the game, it's not clear how much. However, it's certainly worth at least another five plays or so.

I like it but it wasn't a big hit with my group. It felt like 7 wonders duel mixed with Splendor, where you could take people's stuff. I think I'd rather just play one of those two games.

One of the best cardgames I have played in recent years. The game is all about timing: when do I dare to expose myself with little military strength, when do I use military cards as resources, when do I attack, how long do I dare to save my resources for a particular card, etc. Consequently, there is a lot of turn angst in this game, and with three players you are kept on your toes the whole time. The gameplay itself is so original that it does take some getting used to, but that is the only flaw I could think of after my first game game.

I've found the secret to bailing out of any Kickstarter game:  set up a friendly wager, the outcome of which is that the game's advocate must play something else if there are misspellings on any of the game components.  Trust me, it has yet to fail.

Also, I have a word to the wise for reference sheet editors.  There's a severe difference between "[i]aids[/i] production" and "aids [i]production[/i]".  One is a prophylactic tragedy of third world proportions and one is a Guns & Steel card ability.

Guess which one is funnier and will be a permanent in-joke until the owner is shamed into leaving the game at home.

7 after 1 play.

Main game mechanic is rather innovative, allowing the entire game to be condensed into just a deck of cards. Interaction is indirect, with the buying of cards removing and opening up options at the same time, and the threat of attacks. Replayability may be on the low side though, given that the same cards appear in the pyramid and only the wonders change slightly from game to game. Artwork is good and card quality is fine.

Another Wallace design that I find just a little too clever for its own good (see also Princes of Rennaissance). I like the idea of the immediate and different end conditions but the card mechanism just gets bogged down.

RATING: 7.5
I really like the theme (although it's somewhat pasted on), luck of the draw can be a factor, but there is also alot of tactics and strategy.  An interesting aspect is the sudden death victory conditions, giving players who are "out of the game" a real chance to win, and keeping the leaders on their toes all game.  Definitely some issues once again with the Warfrog rulebook.

I don't understand why I don't like this more, the theme is great, I RRT and enjoy PotR.
It just feels a bit thrown together - whats with the battle box? and the weird card mix? and Paris? and the exception based victories? Maybe its just a game you have to know inside out before you enjoy. Hopefully one day it will "click" for me.
*edit*
I'm really going off Martin Wallace designs and will probably avoid them in the future.

Game has not only a strategic value but also does give the feeling of the changing alliances of the French revolution and the chaos of the whole process with the various warring political parties. The battle board being a very interesting mechanic that I feel also adds theme and strategy. Only downside is learning the rules is quite the problem with a lot of interpretations of the same rule from different people but pass that hump really enjoy it and highly recommended.

A few different ways for earning VPs.  A few different ways the game can end.  Feels like area control but with a lot of twists (i.e., not quite).  Rather steep learning curve.  I doubt I really picked up much after only one play.  A lot of player interaction.  Pretty thematic.  Some brain-burning.

I feel like I got a taste of it from one play.  Not sure how much I like it, it didn't hook me, but I would play it again.

RATING: 9
Wow!  There's a lot going on in this game.  A trifle overwhelming the first time through.  Great interlocking mechanics.  I have to say that the "luck of the draw" does have an effect.  First game, I had great cards, and in a field of six, came in second, one point behind the winner.  Could probably have won but throughout the game, I kept saying, "Wow, I didn't know you could do that."  Second game, very mediocre cards.  Not much to work with and ended way back in the pack.  So I hit both extremes, but I imagine that most people's cards would fall between those.  An excellent game that I can't wait to play again!

The luck of the initial draw is annoying...

in 4 games, I have yet to draw a 3 power card in my initial hand, and in 2 games I drew no 2 power cards either....

The fact that you can keep and play these cards again each round makes this a huge disadvantage if you are unlucky.

The best part of this game is that it has 3 different victory conditions....

RATING: 5
I wanted so much to like this game of French revolutionary politics.  There is some clever melding of hand management and area control mechanics with some very nice thematic touches, such as the three different victory conditions.  

However, in the final reckoning there is just too much randomness.  A critical part of the game is building a powerful hand of cards; as many three-block cards as possible, concentrated in one or two colours, a couple of them with general's hats.  With or without the Dagger variant, whether you get that powerful hand is down to the luck of the draw.

The situation on the map is very fluid, with quite small shifts of influence capable of altering the outcome of an election.  The board's 27 areas are exactly three times the number in El Grande.  As the election nears, this all leads to a lot of counting and calculation. Just figuring out the situation, let alone what others playing after you may do to it is too much hard work.  So you do something and hope for the best.

The battles that pay handsomely in victory points are risky too, because you need a general character in your display to win one.  Generals may as well come with a target pinned to them as there are few more effective ways of denying an opponent points than sending their general to the guillotine.

I'm no luck hater, but if you want me to play a game for two hours+, I need a greater influence over the outcome than Liberte offers.

RATING: 4.5
Old school area control game. Despite the name on the cards and various artwork from the french revolution, the game feels very abstracted and dry. You just place cubes around and you prepare for the tie-breaker battle that will inevitably happen because each region has an arbitrary limit of 3 cubes per colour.  Boring!
  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
A fantastic game, with a wargame feel but it's all about French revolutionary politics (there is a bit of fighting). I really enjoy it every time I play, and it plays relatively quickly for a multi-player game with this feel. The different end games/victory conditions really make the game. 

Would think of buying but several people at Epsom have it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.05
My rating after a single play.  Suprisingly more abstract than I though it would be, Liberte is an interesting numbers game trying to gain a majority hold over each province.  Although the theme is more essential than pasted on, I feel it could be replaced a different theme with little effect on game play.  None the less, I look forward to more plays of this one to explore more of the diffferent strategies.  Update:  I've played this one a few times and my rating has changed very little 7.75 to 7

This is a good area majority / control game that plays very well with 3.  The game can run a tad long, so it is important to keep it moving.

RATING: 6
How to play, how to score and how to win are very distinct concepts. Anyone teaching the game to new players needs to make this clear, otherwise you’re going to be rudderless your first game.   

An area control game in which the base mechanics are rather bland.  However, it is saved by 2 things strapped onto the base: radical government and counter revolution.  These aspects also tie the theme into an otherwise  mechanical exercise by adding revolutionary chaos which experienced players can have some control over.   You really need to play with a group that wants to embrace these aspects or it will be a boring point salad.  Not a game for players who prefer their victor to be the player who optimized the most effectively, although that could happen.

Mmmh. It's the worst Wallace game I've played. There are lots of solid and balanced mechanics but overall it seemed a bit pointless back and forth in certain areas:I'll influence this area, you'll influence that, then I'll cancel your influence, then you'll cancel mine, then we draw cards again, and start all over. It needed something extra on the main mechanic to tie all the good mechanics together. I like the different victory conditions and the votes' balance on the cards.

This is an elegant game with classic mechanics (card management, area majority) brilliantly interwoven with new ideas (variable end of turn based on block exhaustion). The theme is not completely pasted on, because each political faction's dominance can lead to different outcomes. Although there's some luck based on card draw, it's definitely a good and enjoyable game.

Initial Impression: The Valley Games edition has beautiful components. This is an area control game with lots of chaos and information crunching that goes on during the game. Your choices and decisions are dictated by the cards you are dealt. Wild swings in randomness can see the loser winning the game in just one or two turns. Definitely a brain burner.

The game itself wasn't that bad, but the alternative end was far too brutal. Looked like playing an evening without any reason, building up, searching the best tactics, but afterwards it was just for no reason.

RATING: 6
Liberte is a "take that" sort of game.  Being able to remove a general and an opponent's stack as an appended action (using a Terror card) allows for a high screwage factor.  If Terror cards are used to target the "victory point" leader, then I can understand the purpose, but it really sucks if the players in last place are the ones mostly being terrorized!  With experience, players realize that Generals are only to be played at the end of a turn, but only if you are last (or 2nd to last) in turn order.  Otherwise they get assasinated.  

The color choices for the components and gameboard are horrendous!  I also feel that the silhouettes on the cards are completely generic and lack any resemblance of character.  For example, each general had the exact same silhoette and to top it off, they all looked like poodles!  I'd probably enjoy the game a whole lot more if a new art design and color scheme were used.

Update: Valley games 2010 Edition is awesome!  The cards are no longer generic, the art is great and the colors match the board.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Unique among the games I've played in incorporating area influence among three factions, so that players are not just trying to gain control of areas but also watching out for which of the three factions are gaining strength and then attempting to stay on the winning team. Its a bit confusing at first, but it becomes clear that one needs to gain the most for one faction or gain the most for their competition. Scores are close, so that one must consider not just which faction to support, but which players this will hurt / benefit. Added to this is a bit of chaos in action card plays which I feel detracts somewhat from the game. Nonetheless this is another clever game from Wallace that is worth several plays to fully appreciate.

RATING: 4
Nice wooden bits but board is decidedly bland. Artwork could be improved 100 fold. Essentially all the action stems from the cards dealt and drawn. In our first game one player kept drawing unplayable cards or low dross (and no generals!!). Into the last round and he was yet to score a point and in retrospect it was hard to criticise his actions. It's very frustrating when the same players keep laying 3 block cards on Paris and you have never had a 3 let alone a card that allows you to lay in this territory. I'm sure there might be strategies to curb this but the card draw does dole out the luck and opportunities and this is substantially random.

Fantastic! Area control with some major twists and turns. I really like the mechanisms in this game. Card play is super easy to understand, but requires a lot of thought. Should you save cards in your display for tiebreakers and to get back next turn? Or discard them. Should you pick up 2 1 value cards or a 3 value? Special cards (Especially Terror, yikes!!) really ramp up the "Take That" factor. The Election phase is very tense. The Battle box can make the game for you as they are very few VP's to go around. Martin Wallace remains one my favorite designers and this one might be my favorite of his. Keeper!!!

I rate this a 7 after our maiden game, a 4 player affair. The game was new for everybody and it ended in turn 3 with a Royalist counter revolution. My rating could go up once I am convinced that the Royalist counter revolution will not occur in every game. Seemed very anti-climactic.

My most toted and least played game. I've had it for over a year and it looks really good and I can't wait to play it, but I've taken it with me to every Bay Area Games Day (every 6-8 weeks), and I never manage to get it to the table, and it's too long for a regular game night (all mine are on weeknights), and I don't play on weekends that often, and when I do, I rarely have enough people for this, and if that weren't bad enough, on top of everything else, it defies punctuation and makes me write in run-on sentences. I hate this game. Sour grapes. This game sucks.

1 play (4-er).  A reasonably fun area control game.  Semi-steep learning curve that hits you about halfway through the 1st game.  Rules aren't overly complex, but it takes a while to explain rules (30 min).  Luck of card draw can be significant.  We found it difficult to keep recalculating majorities.  Strategy Tip -- Don't frivolously spend your strong personality cards to break ties because unspent cards in your "display" go back into your hand for re-use in the next round.

Another Martin Wallace area influence style game with a French Revolution theme. Lots of clever ideas here but missing something I can't quite put my finger on which keeps the game from hitting the table more often.

My conclusion was that the theme got a bit buried by the mechanics which, while undeniably clever, turned the game into much of a "procedural." The same thing happened for me in "El Grande." Actually, the theme here is stronger than that but still...

Maybe my bottom line should be, "If you liked El Grande you would likely enjoy this one too."

Probably my favorite Martin Wallace game! The perfect blend of theme, history, mechanics, and gameplay! 3 possible ways to win, 2 different ways to get points... only points may not always win you the game!

As always, the hallmark of a superlative game is simple rules, and yet great strategic depth arising from the mechanics, map, different strategies, inter- & intra- faction conflicts, the co-opetition between players, and sometimes sudden, dramatic about turns. 

None of your damn cube pushing, multi-level upgrading, card-drafting, dice-rolling, monster generating crap. Only the best, streamlined, finely balanced mix of faction, region, type, and timeline concentration of the cards.

Juego de mayorías que viene a simular la convulsa Francia antes de la revolución francesa. Se tratan de pugnas políticas entre moderados, radicales y monarquistas.

Dura cuatro turnos,y en cada turno hay una fase de acciones, en la que los jugadores van jugando cartas y haciendo sus acciones. Después hay una fase de batalla y por ultimo se hace un recuento de los puntos. La facción con más puntos sube al pder.

Es un buen juego, pero no le jugué en condiciones.

Wallace is by far the best boardgame designer around.
This game is excellent with how the mechanics intertwine with each other, and how important it is to get area control to do well in the elections and gain victory points.

One of the best area control games that I have played. Very hard to get control due to other players interactions.
Also very nice feature that you can win in other ways than victory points only. Give the far behind players something to play for.

Very addictive game.
Would be a 10 if it wasn't for the colour mismatch between card and board.

Lots of little things make this game special compared to other area majority games. To begin with, there are three victory conditions, which means everyone is in contention until the end. It also means all players must be alert to others' intentions, because each move can have a butterfly effect. Finally, set collecting and hand management are very important aspects to resolve the very common ties for region dominance. The ice on the cake is "speaking" in French while playing. Our last session was so much fun I am even tempted to give Liberté an 8.

Oozing with theme. Area influence with layers. A little more luck than I would like it to be; usually the unfortunate result of card drafting.

Terrible colour schemes; hope the Valley Games reprint will correct that problem.

Update 2010:

7.0 -> 8.0 the new Valley Games edition is much more user friendly with its colour scheme. The modified Dagger variant is now the official rule, so it helps to lessen the single-stack card problem.

8.0 - 7.5 after a few more plays, this games shows a bit more luck than I would like: whoever has more triples gets a big leg up.

Liberte is interesting but it seems more and more to me that Martin Wallace/Warfrog games are quite abstract and more complex than they really ought to be.  Played once with four players and had fun but for me Liberte really lacks the elegance and substance that El Grande offers yet feels eerily similar.  And apparently I must be pink/purple color blind according to this game.

Rather interesting to consider in context: Way out West and Empires of the Ancient World were games that had truly intruiging game play, but both ended up being significantly flawed. Liberte is definately much less inspired than either previous Warfrog game, but also overall seems to hang together better (well, OK, except for the card "drafting" element which doesn't work at all, and probably should be considered a significant drawback). It seems, though, to lack that "hook", that interesting idea or clever spin that makes a game interesting to play; Liberte is a pretty vanilla compete-for-areas game, with a large chaos element (through the cards) that simply doesn't grab me. For me, it certainly lacks the appeal of Empires (Liberte feels at some level a lot like El Grande without any of the good stuff), but it plays cleanly and appears to be without the balance issues of previous Warfrog games. Decent game, certainly not great, definitely a try-before-you-buy. Oh yeah, and it's *much* too long.

[17/11/05]Liberté has arguably been on the game I've most yearned to play for the past two years or so. Finally, I've got my first game under my belt and am glad to say that my high expectations were not disappointed.

I love political games and Liberté does a fine job in capturing the chaotic feeling of the French Revolution. Also, given my ancestors fought on the Royalist side (and suffered accordingly...) there's a special thematic attraction for me.

The inspired scoring mechanism with alternative paths to victory ensure matters remain tense and allow for players trailing the others in VPs to have a shot at victory.   A textbook example of strong theming and game mechanics being happily wedded together.

However, it has to be said that the card draw system doesn't work. Hence the clogging up of the card display. Fortunately, the Dagger variant solves this problem effortlessly and it (or similar remedies) are strongly recommended.

In mere game mechanics, I don't rate it as highly as El Grande(+ König&Intrigant expansion). Yet the historical flavour just brings a unique experience to the table and joins Die Macher, Im Schatten des Kaisers, Kreml, Diplomacy etc in the hall of fame of political boardgames.

Another wonderful Martin Wallace game.

After one play, seems like a good but undifferentiated Euro, albeit with a more interesting theme. Not in the same league as some of Wallace's other titles, such as Struggle of Empires, Age of Steam, or Perikles. Perikles especially seems like a better Liberte.

RATING: 5.7
Overrated game.  The production is pretty shitty.  And boy, for an event that should inspire thematic games, this is truly an exercise in being abstract.  I have nothing against abstract games, but this one really doesn't succeed in completing it's goal of being a thematic revolution game.  If all of Wallace's games are like this, they will get a pass from me.  It is not all bad.  It has mechanics I like, but then there is really very little to be done when you have bad cards.  Getting worthwhile cards is the game, and the deck distribution is all over the place.  Some cards are, frankly, worthless.  A one block card fills empty spaces, but becomes a target for other players.  You then have to be really lucky to use a 1 block card to make one of your stacks bigger, since it is region and color specific.  The special cards are really freaking strong and a total screwage mechanic.  But, that wouldn't bug me so much if the game play was 30 minutes to 1 hour shorter.  I think what bugs me the most is that 3 block cards exist in the deck randomly.  You draw these, you are golden (until someone dicks you).  If you only see a couple the whole game, might as well cash in your chips and walk out.  Now, if there were only 1-2 block cards in the game, it would improve in the following ways: 1) the round wouldn't end so abruptly 2) there would be more fighting in certain territories 3) there would be more reasonable decisions as to whether increase the height of a stack or enter into an empty territory.  It would also make the fighting ties more competitive.  Another thing that chaps me is the whole general mechanic.  I think if you waste an influence turn to play in the army box, then that should be a real competition.  Needing a general to win, which means drawing it randomly and hoping he doesn't get killed, is ridiculous.  Having a majority there should be enough.  I guess maybe they felt it would be too much like El Grande.  Wallace could have learned something from those early area influence games.

RATING: 6
The rules are clever but are set out rather illogically. There are lots of ways to score victory points and the two sudden death victories (Royalist Counter Revolution and Radical Landslide) keep all the players in contention. 

All three of my games so far have ended prematurely with a Royalist Counter Revolution. I suspect that this is relatively easy to engineer when playing with newbies who don't see it coming.

My only minor complaint is that the stacks of blocks are easy to knock over. It would be rather nice if in a reprint the blocks fitted together so that the stacks were a bit more stable.

My fourth game ended with the standard victory conditions, probably because I was keeping a careful eye on the royalist blocks. The Dagger variant would seem to be essential to encourage players to take the face up cards.

A funny old one to rate this. I love the feeling of playing this game. It is like being sucked into a swirling maelstrom. It is a political area dominance game where you are not only trying to get the most of your bits into each area but you must also support the right party. The placement itself uses cards that allow you to place variable amounts of pieces. Until the votes are taken it is very difficult to tell who is ahead. 

There are three ways in which the game can end. The royalist counter revolution and the radical landslide are driven by players placing an excess of these parties. These result in an early game end and scoring with the players who supported the respective parties scoring well. There are also wars in which generals battle it out to support one side or the other and gain their players VPs. In the deck of characters, there are take that cards that kill players characters and throw votes in various regions. 

I hope this description gives you an idea of what Liberte is like. Some people I have played it with have hated it. It doesn't have the simple clean lines of games like El Grande and China. It is confusing and disorientating. This is the reason I personally get so much out of it.

Bloated King of Siam. Four times as long, one quarter as interesting. Some people have noted how much fun the game is. It is not in any way my idea of fun.

The outcomes of the elections are eminently predictable/countable. The only thing that prevents it is the tedium of doing so, not some murkiness of the gamestate itself. Heck, I love murk! And this game ain’t got murk.

Don’t even get me started on the tedium of trying to remember which cards people have drawn! Damn you hidden but trackable info! ‘Poor man’s tension’ says I. An amateurish tool to ratchet up the sense of drama when there is no drama.

Liberte is a cleverly designed area control game with a French Revolution theme that, while it isn't in any way a simulation, feels more than totally pasted on. The distribution of cards is such that the moderates and royalists start with the upper hand, struggle against a red tide in turns 2-3, before things even out again in turn 4. This is a solid game worth playing, but not without its warts:

1) the AP-prone are liable to go berserk at this game -- which may or may not be a contributing factor to
2) so far my games have gone past the two-hour mark instead of the promised 90 minutes -- and there are just better two-plus-hour games in my collection.
3) the presentation of the rules is not exactly user-friendly. The notion that this is the second edition of those rules is amusing.
4) 95% of the game, mechanically, is quite straightforward and fun. The other 5% just seems ... unnecessarily difficult.

What I'm saying is: it's a good game, play it for sure. Buy it if it scratches an itch. Just don't expect miracles.

While I wouldn't call the ruleset elegant, I find that it is largely fast playing and easy to teach.  First timers will clock in at just under two hours but with a few games under their belt this baby hums at 70-90 minutes.

Interesting area control game with multiple victory conditions. In the event of a runaway leader, players can work towards a revolution or counter revolution as alternate victories thereby keeping all players actively involved in seemingly losing positions.

A game that was fun to play, too bad it took so long to finish, but then again three of us were beginners and so had to learn the rules - which naturally slowed down the gameplay (we were four in total). It didn’t take very long to learn and quickly got interesting, a really neat strategy game. I’m not too much into these sorts of games though, nothing I would buy unless I found it real cheap at a market. Still, it was an interesting and fun game to play. Might have another game someday, who knows.

Played once. I expect my rating will rise with further playings. This game has a very unique feel to it. Certainly, its an area control game under all the dressing. But there are several different ways to score the few VPs you can get. Several strategies seem viable. You really need to be paying attention to what your opponents are up to.

Even more, though, is the cool addition of 2 'alternate endings'. Whereas something like El Grande leaves you trying to get the most VPs, in Liberte the politics can result in two 'sudden death' endings where either the royalists stage a successful counter-revolution or the radicals take over the country. In either case, the 'election results' are irrelevant. Thematically that makes sense. In game terms, it means the VPs are ignored and influence in either of those two parties ALONE is the winning condition. 

So, there are interesting forces at work to influence which parties are doing well. Players cannot work on a strategy in isolation, or someone can short-circuit the main arm of the game (the VP elections) by triggering one of the two special endings. I really dig that.

One beef with the game is that it seems very conducive to pauses to 'calculate' where things are at, which party and which player has what advantage. Since almost all the information is right on the board, its easy enough to get that level of detail. Its just obnoxious when each person feels the need to do that on their turn in order to play well. I'm not sure if that would evaporate with more playings and more familiarity, but I'm guessing its just a part of the fabric of the game.

RATING: 8
The short of it: Wallace succeeds again. The long of it: Again, Martin Wallace takes a historical theme and crafts it into a wonderful game system. This is one of the more singularly unique area influence games I've played to date, and the theme absolutely oozes from the box. Unlike normal AIGs winning individual areas is only part of the battle. Each player is basically buying influence in the three parties in revolutionary France: The Monarchists (Reactionaries), the Moderates (basically democratically inclined) and the Commune / "Clubs" (aka: the Radicals, aka: the streets will run red with the blood of our enemies, many of whom are in our own party). The trick is that the individual provinces don't score as such, when you control a given party that in turn ends up winning a given province you simply get a block in that colour to denote that you have some sway with that party. Then, after all of the provinces are tallied up the party that will form the new government of France as a whole is declared, and the players with the most and second most influence in that party over the board as a whole are awarded points, as is the player who had the most influence in the opposition (second place) party. This means that you really need to go all or nothing to score points; winning a few provinces is usually good for nothing, and having influence in the party that is going to finish third is a complete waste of time. To add a bit more flair more points are also attainable via the battle that happens each turn, as players attempt to get their favoured general to lead the people to victory for glory (and VPs) but with the guillotine up and running and the purges coming fast and furious it can often be just as much trouble to win a battle as it is to win sway in a party. In a final historical twist, the game normally goes 4 rounds, but there are two special game ending conditions, one to signify the reactionaries forming a counter-revolution, the other to indicate a radical landslide, either of which throw the entire victory point system out of whack and instead give the game to the player who had the most influence in the reactionary or radical party depending on the condition that turn. This means that even if a player is out of the race in the VPs they can still try to force one of the two other victory conditions to occur, which is a neat way of keeping people involved. 

I have played this game with 3, 4, 5 and 6 now, and I like it with all of the numbers, though 3 is obviously very soft because the 3 stack limit does not impact the game (i.e.: do not buy this game only to play with 3, it is not an 8 at that scale). I would venture so far as to say 4 is probably be the best mix of control and uncertainty, but 5 is also very good. I now play exclusively with the Dagger variant (if there are two one block cards available, you can draft them both, when you play one block cards you can play two of them) and I think it improves the game because it lessens the clogging of the card display and gives people more ability to do what they want to do as opposed to hoping they can get the cards to do it. It also has the side effect of increasing the speed of the game.

I will nitpick and say that the battles seem a bit expensive and risky because the special cards that are used to bump off generals are very common, and because there just aren't that many generals in the game it is very hard for anyone to keep one out. As soon as one of the poor bastards would put on his silly hat the Directory would put his name on "the list" and soon his head would be rolling down the street. Such was life in revolutionary France though, so at least it's in flavour :-) I think in reality, the battle box is meant to be a catch-up mechanism, because the points are easiest for people late in the order to get (i.e.: because they can be more sure that their general is going to actually stay in play) but they are also meant to be lucrative enough to lure people who are higher into the order into the fight for.

The thing that makes this game an 8, and one reason why it might still move up is the way it absolutely drips tension in the last portion of each round, with the block supply being a crucial factor in what you can do, how, and when, which is always good stuff. 

Overall, a very fun game at its best when using the Dagger variant and yet another reason for heavy game fans to keep the name Martin Wallace in mind when they go out shopping for a new title. (On a final aside: make sure to print out the colour aids...the differences betwixt the cards and the board definitely cause some problems otherwise)

Liberté was a blind purchase: it was either this or Age of Steam. I cannot recall how I stumbled onto it: I think it was because I was traversing the list of games available at the store I placed my order. The pictures of all those stacks of blocks with colourful discs on them piqued my interest. Unfortunately it took much, much longer to get to the table than I had envisaged. This game is for the enthusiast with at least 2 hours to spare, and there were so many other titles I wanted to try first... Choices, choices.

Righty. Game. Liberté is a funky excercise in area majority gaming, but it has quite a unique feel to it which you won't find anywhere else. For starters, there's a cap to the amount of influence you can have in a province, causing numerous tiebraking rounds. This also makes it genuinely hard to predict which faction will eventually end up in the government: you're counting like '7 provinces sure victory, 4 ties. Oh, now it's 8 sure victories and 3 ties'. It's hard to get into the government, so there's other ways in which you can score points, and these seem quite effective too. Finally, you have to be on the lookout for the sudden-death victory conditions. These can occur completely outside of your control, and the fact that all obtained points are voids at that time can leave a sour aftertaste. Only with repeated plays will you learn how to 'read' the board and understand how everything fits together so you can actively strive for a sudden death victory&mdash;or to avert one.

All in all, the game is weird, but attractive in its own right. It's tough to get a feel for because it is hard to keep track of  /- 30 provinces with stacks of blocks in them, and if this could somehow be made easier, the game would gain a lot of appeal almost instantaneously. Nevertheless, it has a lot of interesting and original ideas going for it.

This games seems a bit strange for an old hex gamer.  But a group of 6 found it to be a lot of fun after stumbling through the first turn trying to understand.  By the 3rd turn it was pure cut throat heaven. You can play for fun and just take a casual look at the board and see how your are doing and act according or you can spend a ton of time figuring out the perfect move. Best just look quickly and act. One clue, don't be in the lead early as everyone starts gunning for you.  If you go late in the turn you can make a lot of things happen and the others can't react to you if the turn is ending.  A great game.

An absolut masterpiece of game design about an historical simulation regarding the political dynamics in the french revolution!
The fight for area control, the ideia of "trying to go along with the winner", the ideia of the sudden royal victory, etc, all compete to produce a compelling game.
My rating just does not get higher because it´s a little exausting to try to calculate all the multiple province majorities over 2,3 hrs or more, and also because of the possibility of killing the military generals, a bit brutal in terms of ruining a strategical plan, making useless the battle investiments (doesn´t pay for the risk).

Limited controlled of the game by the players, card drawn dictated the gameplay for the most part. Uneventfully and plain gamplay.

RATING: 8.5
First Impression:  Like a longer and more intricate "Imperium" (from GMT games' 'Rome' compilation).  Takes more than one game to really get all the rules down, but very solid game with several winning strategies.  I like how each round gives you more choices in how to score, but you are heavily affected by what you did in the previous round.  My biggest complaint is the color scheme; too hard to tell which cards go with which province.  This seems to be a common mistake in games these days though.

Second Impression:  Still really like it, but boy do those terror/purge/etc. cards cause some randomness!

I want to rate this higher but after many plays I feel that it's just too enslaved to the luck of the draw for a game that can approach 3 hours in length.  The systems are very clever, but it's too easy to get stuck with cards that don't give you good options, especially with 5 or 6 players.  Perhaps worthy of a 7 with 3-4 players and a 6 with 5-6.

Great game - had played it incorrectly previously (removing all tiles from all areas after election - made the game far too long and skewed towards the Radicals).

It's the right mix of strategy, tension and chaos. Recommended for serious gamers - can be completed in 90-120 minutes.

The more I play it the less I like it. Every single time it ends in a counter revolution. Perhaps we are doing something wrong here, but as long as two players want it to end that way it's very hard to stop. I don't like the combats either as they really add very little to the game.

Probably need to give it one more try.  The game seemed to take itself a lot more seriously than it should.  Basically it is very much a "take that" game.  You have cards (which are quite limiting) that allow you to put 1 of 3 different color markers in squares topping them off with your control marker.  A very common play mechanic with the twist that instead of just trying to have the majority in the space you are also trying to control the most of that color overall.  There's also a combat box that is fool's gold.  You need some specific cards in order to put your markers in the combat box.  However, those cards can easily be taken out of play rendering all your markers worthless.  I think this game is clearly a "miss", but I'm willing to give it another chance...hoping we got some rules wrong.

RATING: 5
A game set during the French Revolution. There are three politicial parties attempting to seize power in France. The players are factions behind each party, and exert influence over each of the parties. Party influence is played onto the board via a simple card mechanic. At the end of each round, an election is held with points being awarded to the players who most strongly supported the winning party and the opposition. There is lots to consider here, with rapid changes of fortune a feature. The game runs four turns, but can end if one of two "sudden death" victory conditions are met. A nice blend of design elegance and theme. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Similar to Discworld in a very vague sort of way, with the cardplay aspect being simpler and the placement mechanic being more complicated.  The board state gets increasingly difficult to assess as the game progresses, particularly because you are wanting to not only get a feel for what it looks like right now, but also what it will likely look like at the start of the next turn.  Wasn't blown away but did enjoy it, and will play again.

Liberté is an another Martin Wallace game which I enjoy quite a lot along with Age of Steam and Princes of the Renaissance to name a few. I am very happy with my game purchase.

I find the concept of Liberté very interesting and unique. Who knew politics of the french revolution could be so much fun !

The only problem with Liberté is if you are colored blind. The choice of colors is very poor. In some cases, the color on the board doesn't match the color on the card. It can be confusing for some people.

I recently replayed Liberté. It was a 4 player game. The Royalist won. I want to try a 6 player game to see how tight a game would be.

The more Liberté gets played, the more I enjoy it for what it is. Another winner from Warfrog!

RATING: 6
This is a tough one to rate because I admire the mechanics and theme but there are some things that bothered me enough to give it a slightly above average rating.   First, there are too many Assassins in circulation that makes it's very difficult to score points in the Battle Box.  Some people enjoy the back and forth of special power cards, but I easily get annoyed from stuff like this.  To minimize the chaos, I think it would be more interesting if players had a certain amount they could use during the game.  Also, the game requires players to constantly count many blocks that can be a bit tedious.  I'm fairly lenient on poor components but the cards deserve mentioning because the colors can be confusing since they don't match the board that well.  All of these things together wouldn't be so bad if the game played under 2 hours but my first game was very long and based on other reviews, long games are the norm.  Still, I admire the Liberte and can see why it's well regarded.

Leave it to Martin Wallace to turn area majority inside out. Players are NOT the 3 factions of the French Revolution; they can control all of them in various regions. Players seek to have the most control of the faction that ends up winning each election. Players can also win (even if behind in the VP race) through Revolution or Counter-Revolution.

There's lots of detail to track in this game, and you do the same things over and over, but it doesn't feel repetitive. Your first play of the game will be chaotic, until you get more familiar with the game. I really like the two "sudden death" victory conditions, the multiple ways to score victory points, and the feeling that the game develops as you go along; the beginning of the game doesn't feel the same as the end. This is in part due to the board starting blank and being more crowded towards the end, and in part because as the game progresses, there are more and more ways to score victory points. I always have a good time when this hits the table.

Or do I place my influence in the Battle Box? Many tough calls. Highly recommended.

RATING: 5
Mechanically, this is a very sound game and it all works cleverly as a system for forcing multiplayer interaction and the experience of changing fortunes, however, I don't find it all that fun. The biggest culprit is how much recounting you need to do; you're constantly recounting who's winning what in this game (in up to 27 areas) so you can consider if putting white blocks out that will beat somebody else's red blocks is going to benefit you or merely someone else. 

Of course, after doing those calculations, the next player will change everything anyway, but sorting through this level of chaos is the ostensible fun of the game and it hangs together. In fact, I see similarities in another Wallace game I love, A Study in Emerald, for how you are asked to manage a chaotic game state to your eventual benefit. The difference for me here is I don’t like games that ask me to constantly recount the state of the game board as the basis of its fun.

Then there’s an additional layer of friction in wading through random card draws and take-that card play. As a result, the depth of decisions just doesn’t outweigh the level of game and player created chaos. It all works as a clever system, I especially like the sudden death victory conditions that create an additional axis of consideration, but I find other area majority games such as Chaos in the Old World more fun.

For the record, I scored 0-0-2-11 and won a 6P game.

Beautiful game and lots of fun to play...  I need to find a way to play this again soon but not everyone likes Marin Wallace games.  Love the radical victory condition and the elections.  If you get far behind the leaders you switch to the upset strategy and go for broke.  The leaders always have to watch over their shoulders.  It doesn't hurt that it's a period of history I find interesting.  I also love area majority games, the board and the cards.       Wallace is a favorite of mine.  Note: people I've played this with have found it too abstract or something.  With all Martin Wallace games they get better with a couple plays because it's hard to understand what to do until the systems click.  I'd like to play this game more than I do...  I think the learning curve is a turn off for some folks.

If you play this a while, I imagine there is a pretty interesting game in there, but I have little desire to play it again for two reasons.  One, doing well requires counting little stacks of up to six different players in three different colors constantly which is extremely annoying.  What's even more annoying is all the special cards that screw one player over.

RATING: 9
Really excellent game. In my top 3 Wallace's games.

The theme is really well implemented :
- computational and chaotic at the same time : normal for a game on the revolution
- majority game : normal for a game of elections
- characters from this period (Danton, Robespierre, Napoleon Bonaparte ...)
- victory conditions : Radical Electoral Landslide and Royalist Counter-Revolution

You need to watch everywhere, to eat on all the racks, to get back your jacket, to know if it is worth or not to defend the homeland, knowing when to play for the Royalist Counter-Revolution...

Always difficult choices to make, several possible strategies and always that feeling of being unable to do anything either for lack of token or because we lack the right card.

Awesome 3 players game

I like the design of the whole system. You use the cards to place your forces on the map, and you can keep some of those cards in order to break ties in the future or to take up into your hand at the end of the turn so you can use them again. All the action cards do small things, eliminate one block or whatever, but used correctly can make a big difference. I like that subtlety. I think some people might feel that there is too much chaos in the game to be able to rise above it with an actual working plan, especially after their first game when they really don't know what to do. I hope they give it a second play, you can overcome the complexity and it's fun regardless!

Superb medium-heavy strategy game about the French Revolution. Clever design (e.g. the radicals get stronger in the second half) makes the game unfold so close to history that it merits the term "simulation." Simple mechanics (draw a card, play a card) belies a lot of depth underneath.

RATING: 3
Although played my rating will wait on this one.  We messed up a couple rules, oversites really, that effected the amount of chaos involved in the game.  We forgot the open face card draw and missed the rule about the radicals having to be in power to play terror cards.  With the rules stated above I can imagine a lot more strategy breathes into this title, as most likely the Dagger variant will as well.  With all said however, I found the feel of this title to be fresh, and fast paced. Even though Liberte did feel chaotic I found this fitting with the theme of revolution.  I definetly want to get this to the table again soon, and with the corrections applied.  I feel there is something great here.

UPDATE: This is just a title that doesn't work for me.  Where upon first play I was decepted by the randomness as some thematic link to riotous times in old France, the reality is that this game is just randomness with out any real game. To many balance issues bog this one down.

Played once and we did one thing incorrectly - we played Terror cards even though the Radical (red) faction was not the present government.

A very good game marred by a poorly-written manual, mediocre reference cards, ugly board design (fonts!), control token colors that confuse even the non-color blind, and the notorious mismatch between board colors and card color palettes.

Still, if ever a game deserved a second, improved, edition, it's Liberté.

Played once, ended in a royalist counter-revolution.  The player who was ahead by a lot won anyway.  I like the idea of multiple ways to trigger the ending, but this game will take many more playings to get the hang off the strategy. I've heard it said that the counter-revolution happens more often than not.  Is it too easy to achieve?

Played a second time.  One player got murdered in the scoring because he ended up tied in so many situations and had to burn his display cards, not to break ties, but to prevent his opponents from winning the points.

I think the game deserves a high rating partly because of its unique gameplay.

I've played a few Martin Wallace games like Tempus and Age of Steam, and I had pretty much came to conclusion that he just isn't the designer for me.  I know there are rabid fans out there, but nothing about the games really jumped out at me.  Liberte, however, does jump out.  It's an area control game, but rather than just getting the majority in a region, you also have to back the right faction.  There are also some cards that can kill your plans, and other things to keep in mind like battles and watching out for the two sudden ending conditions.  The components are nice, but the colors are a little too similar in some ways, and some colors on the cards don't match the regions very well.  On the whole, a good game.

This is an alright Martin Wallace game. Area majority card driven. I think the draw card mechanism is broken. It gets bogged down very quickly and you just end up drawing off the top of the pile.

[b] Liberté[/b] [i]Martin Wallace 2001[/i]
Liberte is plenty of theme and a completly different game than the normal majorities stuff. Being out of the top 200 this could be my underdog or "cult game" since I think it deserves at least a top 50 status. The rules are easy to understand but watch out, Liberte is somewhat difficult for beginners and too much of a game for non gamers. This game has a lot of tactical options (when to use the cards, where to use them, try to play conservative or agressive, play a general or not, try to go for the girondine VP victory or one fo the two special jacobine or monarchic victories... etc). Its nicer adition over El Grande is the possibility of winning the game even if you are far behind the VP track, through a Counterrevolution or a Red Terror Uprise. A tremendous but somewhat odd game.

RATING: 8
Liberté is probably the game with the most opaque, tense and far-reaching decisions per minute I have ever played. There are no easy victories, everything must be fought over because you can't put more markers of the map, you top at three. That's a lot of fun and I can see many getting lost during their first play.

Part of the fun of the game is knowing what of your opponent is better fit to do and how you can benefit from it. Add some hidden information and that's quite a hard thing to guess!

The game is often praised for being "thematic" (meaning it has a palpable setting) though I simply do not see it. Sure, in the voting phase you can see it and such but it could be anything at the end of the day.

This one has some interesting mechanics revolving around elections.  If you're in the lead, it's in your interest to keep the more moderate factions in power.  If you're losing, you have the option to go for a sudden death ending that could give you the game.

First game left me a quite neutral opinion. This is not a game which would reveal it's "greatness" in a first game, the problem is that is it intriguing enough to play it enough to know... I don't know yet. I definitely had some luck, a lot of chaos and tactics/strategy.

An OK game, but an open card draft is a poor mechanic for a deck with such a wide range of value. It mainly serves to give the first player an advantage, since nobody will take a one card from the draft and risk giving their opponent a face-up three. Their production staff also did an exceptionally poor job of color matching.

RATING: 5.5
Components: good components
Complex: easy to understand
Weight: medium
Players: 4 or 5
Length: 2 hours or less
Mechanics: area control through the play of cards
Decisions: from some to none
Opinion: I like the idea of the game, you have to control the winning faction on each of the provinces, and try to hold the max pieces of the overall wining faction. I like these area control games, however I did not like this one.
I would play if necessary, but prefer so many games before this one.
What I like: area control, I like this mechanic in a game and how you have to fight on each province controlling 3 different factions. There can be only one player influencing one faction on each province, and there is a maximum of 3 pieces per province. After the round ends, you will only get points for the wining faction in the Country. You can only go to war and get points there.
What I did not like: first of all the decisions, factions enter the provinces depending on the cards you play. At the start of the game you can decide where to go (as long as nobody has done the same as you want before you), but you need the appropriate card. As the game progresses, you have almost no options to choose, you can end with lot of cards in your hand with no use (someone has gone with that faction to that region, or you are already there with a different faction), therefore you can only choose the card you can play.
The game has lot of chaos, and this is not a problem for me in these kind of games, but it is very complicated to have an idea of who is controlling what at first glance, you will need some time to check all provinces before doing anything.
And finally, the game lasts too much for what you get from it. If I have to compare it with another game, I will prefer always Tammany Hall before Liberte 100 times of 100

Liberte is a very chaotic game.  But that's not a criticism - it's a good thing.  Good because it fits the theme (after all, what's more chaotic than the French Revolution?) and also good because it makes for a dynamic, surprising, fascinating game.  The rules are very simple, but the game situations are convoluted and often unstable.  Small changes of influence on the map can have a dramatic cascading effect on the scoring, in a way that can be difficult to predict or control.

Be warned that the game can be opaque and confounding your first time through.  You need to get a feel for when to charge ahead, when to ride coattails, when to go against the grain, when to wait patiently.  The game system repeatedly creates nebulous situations, forcing vague and shifting cabals among the players.  Bloody brilliant stuff.

I highly recommend playing with the Levy/Dagger variant listed at www.huzonfirstgames.com , which increases the worth of the one-block cards and helps keep the card display active.

RATING: 7
Short rules, but quite a complex game with several paths to victory. We made several severe rules mistake the first time. Particularly did we miss that it&#039;s ONLY at tied battle that you remove ALL tiles, but at domination wins in a province, you only remove ONE tile from the winning stack. Unfortunately this is probably a game most of my friends will avoid due to it&#039;s high strategic value. There could be a lagging problem with people who want to optimise their play, by calculating possibilities all the time.

RATING: 8
Eight plays. Has all the excellent mechanisms and playability of a German game with just a touch more complexity, theme, and intensity. The fact that players are fighting for dominance of three political parties rather than for themselves directly means that alliances and rivalries abound; this plus the fact that there are many ways to score VPs (or even make VPs immaterial with sudden-death victory conditions) makes the game seem like many interrelated contests going on simultaneously. A great experience. Incidentally, I strongly prefer the five-player game, though six is okay too (which is notable since so very few games are worthwhile with that number). One last thing: some people have mentioned that the card display gets gummed up with weak cards, and while this is certainly true, I don't think it detracts from the game; sometimes you'll be so desperate you will find yourself hankering for one of those cards, but then you'll be tortured by the idea that something much better might get uncovered for the next guy...agony!

Incidentally, I used to rate this game a little higher but I had to knock it down a couple pegs after suffering through a game in which absolutely nothing came together for me; I hadn't realized before quite how much the players are at the mercy of the cards.

I've only played once, but I was impressed.  It felt similar to El Grande but with a stronger thematic connection.  The possible alternate victory conditions add quite a bit of spice.  My only complaint is that there are several layers between gameplay and VP scoring, so it can be hard to see how individual actions contribute to my ability to win.

Multi-dimensional and multi-tier. Features multiple paths to victory along with two sudden-death conditions for those who are desperate enough to finish the prematurely when other approaches are not viable.

People may gripe about the randomness of the card - with which I may, reluctantly, agree but I reckon it is only their lack of knowledge of the possibilities the game opens that makes them blame the unlucky card drafting instead of their lack of the skills.

This game is too complex to be credibly rated after one play but 8 is a good starting point.

I was in love with this game the first time I played it.  After a few more plays I'm not sure.  I'm concerned about the power of a few of the cards later in the game and their ability to be used for king making.

Will play without the dagger variant next time as it seems to make the rebels more relevant and the loyalists inconsequential.  

Playing without the Dagger variant greatly improved the balance in the game.

Hm, I know I liked it 10 years ago, hence I bought it years later. However, when I played it lately, it couldn't convince me.

There are very nice mechanics in this game, no doubt about that, but I really can't stand games that have this card draw mechanic, where you draw an open card, just to fill the hole with a very good / needed card for your opponent who will just thank you for doing so.

Away from this "no-go" it's a very clever game, but because of this draw mechanic (which adds a lot luck to the game), it won't stay in my collection.

Played with 5 players.  Took the first couple of turns (out of only 4 available) for me to work out how to play.  Thought I was going well (winning the Radical faction leadership in turns 2 & 3), but then in the final round it all went wrong and we let someone win both the battle box and the leadership of the government, catapulting them to the win!  Getting a bunch of 1 block cards is a killer! (I only got 1 3-block card all game, makes it almost impossible to win ties!)

RATING: 7.5
At first sight this might seem a kinder, gentler Wallace, but the demand for resources is high, the number of actions to collect card resources low, and the struggle for the provinces is tight.

This classic Warfrog game (now a Valley reissue) is a multi-player struggle for the right cards at the right time, leverage over the hot parties and the key sites to collect the narrow victory points- or to at least stop the other guy from doing so.

The play seems light, but evrything has a certain value in different situations, and knowing/choosing when and how to best cash that value seemsa to be key here.

I'm starting this at a 7.25- this is clearly a fairly substantial game, with a lot of replay value and interaction between players to keep things interesting.

This is a classic design that has mostly withstood the fads of gamers, and provides excellent opportunities for interesting game play.

Definitely one to pull out again soon.

Update: Raised to a 7.5 after 3rd play (6-player), but with potential to go a lot higher- this plays quite quickly, is full of interesting decisions, and yet has the tight play of a classic Wallce game, with the all the flavour and backdrop of the French revolution.

What's not to like- a lot- about this game?

A martin Wallace game that I like, why's that? well the subject is interesting, the way it is implemented is great, and the way you have to keep an eye out against the Noble and revolutionary insta-win while trying to advance your own interests at the cost of everyone else makes for a game that I'm willing to play whenever it is suggested, which unfortunately isn't often enough.

RATING: 8
Another solid hit from Martin Wallace that convincingly conveys the unpredictable and chaotic political nature of the French Revolution. The ruleset is light, the play is fast, and the components are decent (i.e. the Victory Games reprint).

It is an abstract representation of the French national election, combining political elements of Perikles, card drafting of Thurn & Taxis, area control of El Grande, with a feel of Die Macher, in a more accessible and fluid package.

Card-driven like London, players attempt to secure electoral/influence plurality in each of the 27 provinces, with one of three political parties. Players get VP in obtaining the most "votes" of the winning party that forms a new government, raising and leading an army to fight off foreign invaders (similar to the attack of the Wildings in Game of Thrones), or by occupying key provinces in France. The cards themselves represent famous French figures during that period, such as Napoleon and Robespierre, each with their respective amount of political influence.

As the game progresses through four turns, the game swings wildly with the ruling party changing every turn. Players can favor one party one turn, and then switch to another the next, all depending on how the cards dealt or played out through the previous turn. There are sudden victory conditions where the loyalists can win if seven key provinces are controlled, or the radicals win if they achieve 17 votes--both are difficult to achieve, but not impossible, raising the intensity. Then there are special cards that can be played, representing food riots, political purges, or "terror" cards that represent mass executions of influence and key figures.

Not exactly an accurate historical simulation, but all in all, great fun that captures the feel of the period. I can't wait to play this again. It's a solid '8'.

A heavier game than what I have been playing lately, this game has plenty to keep you busy, but for first-timers is a bit unforgiving. I managed a last-gasp 2nd place ex-aequo with the yellow player (I was playing grey) but this game saw a runaway leader too soon and became a little bit boring. 
Again, very high expectations let me down. Not the game's fault, just me thinking it was going to be awsome and it was just very good.

#18/10/2008: 2nd play won by me on sudden death by counter revolution. This game is only good when played by 4 people that know each other well AND have played this several times. Not so good with newbies and casual gamers.

Not really sure about this one after our initial play. Because the cards are so different there seems to be a fair amount of card luck. 

There are a fair amount of options. Going for leader of the oppostion and/or the battles can be worth a lot too and there is less competition. Plenty of spoiler cards too.

But there is a lot of card luck and you have to play to your hands strengths. But if you draw 'badly' you are then hosed. So I am not sure of it.

For my money this is the most atmospheric of the old  Warfrog games. Out of the box you'll soon notice that colour matching is poor (old hands will remember when every Warfrog game seemed to come with an amateurish production balls up) and this remains the classic case of a game where a card display really doesn't work as the cards vary significantly in value. See the 'Dagger' variant for a workable alternative. Essentially this is an area influence game, which is far from being my favourite mechanism, but being a lover of history the strong Wallacian theme lifts this out of the mire. Suffers from a strong runaway leader problem, hence the alternate endings, but it gets really tense when the leader is trying to avoid the counter-revolution.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is an interesting game with variable ending conditions. Manipulating the ending condition determines the winner. It's a card-driven area control game, which already sounds like good stuff to me.  Because of the variable ending condition, there's a lot of tension in the game, and the historical theme works really well.  I also like the temporary nature of the cards, which allows players to switch sides. (1 play)

Interesting area control game that I enjoyed playing and would gladly play again.  The variable timing of the elections introduce a nice hand management/card timing dynamic that I did not fully appreciate while playing.  A few things hold back my enthusiasm:

- Good luck trying to analyze a full board.  With up to nine different colors in play at any given time, trying to accurately assess player positions is an exercise in futility (or growing rage as your table-mates wait while you agonize over what to do).

- I'm still apprehensive about the idea of limiting your  playable space (and playable factions) to a semi-random card draw.  Get stuck with bad cards and there's little you can do to advance your position or disrupt an opponent's.  During my last game I ended up heavy in the Moderates, which is not a good place to be as it's the only faction without the possibility of a sudden death game ending and I was unable to reign in my opponents' (successful) attempts to end the game.

Well I already posted a negative review people didn't like.  Why was I negative?

Too many rules exceptions.  Not enough critical decisions.  Loose theme.

Horribly inexcusable colors and cardboard mismatch.

I liked the idea of backing different political parties and then being rewarded for backing the winner, but the theme just fell apart in places.  Are you holding the primaries and finals all at once or why can multiple candidates of the same party go against candidates of the other party?  Why stacks 3 high?

The battle box was nice and all... but seemed dang tacked on.

Mostly, I just thought of it as a sloppy Wallace that didn't appeal to my economic side.

initial rating...

I had some issues with the game right from the get-go including it was not very visually attractive. Then some randomness seemed to eat away the strategy for me as did the luck. After saying all that I still think it is a good game that might blossom with more playings as there is some meat to explore but I also wasn't too keen on the sudden death victory element which could negate all victory points in the game, someone who played poorly all game who has a few good cards can pull out a victory without too much trouble it seems, more playings will reveal if this is too easy to trigger or not. Lots of dirty play makes the game fun and sparks some rivalries to watch out for...

[u]UPDATE:[/u]7 => 7.5 Okay so I knew exactly what I was getting into this time and went in with the expectations to really not take it seriously and just have fun. In those terms it is an excellent excellent game. Very unique and extremely strong themed, thematic touches are everywhere and very well done, extra points for this. There might be a little more control than first conceived however it will require ample table talk and co-operation from your fellow players to pull off and thats okay, really that is the way the game was meant to be played. 

The end game conditions are very tricky and need to be watched closely and they ensure a nice amount of tension and uncertainly throughout the game. This is another potential Wallace "the Metagame is the game title" and I certainly did enjoy that part of it. A good strategic title but maybe a little long for the amount of randomness included. It is really an 'experience' game in that you really play for the fun and unique expereince that it provides, no other games like this one that I can think of.

Martin Wallace is quickly becoming one of my favorite game designers.  Got my first play of Liberte in last night.  It worked great with 5 people.  A solid area control game with nice them and some chrome that works... There are difficult decisions but the game never bogged down.  The 'chaos' feel of the general election was excellent and works with the theme.  I can see how some games might be a slaughter if the radicals are in charge repeatedly but that only happened in our last turn which seemed appropriate for end game. If you get unlucky with the card draw you might have trouble competing. All in all, another Wallace title that I thoroughly enjoyed.

RATING: 5
The French Revolution as a German-style boardgame. I had big hopes for this one, but it just didn't do much for me when I finally played it. Compared with Martin Wallace's other games, this one felt more abstract, ie. like just any other generic area majority game.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (May 2011)

I really like Liberte. The game is pure tension and pure chaos. You are never sure who is winning and the game situation can change very quickly. I think it is a great game but a hard one to win. Highly recommend it. Wallace is one of my favorite designers.

I finally played the game again, and it was one of the worst game experiences I have had so far, admittedly that was more for the game group I chose to play the game with than the game itself. Still Liberte is a weird game, you can’t properly or accurately judge it by a couple of plays. It is an area control game but you never know who is winning and which each passing turn the game situation can change radically so planning is very hard. Due to this I think it is best played as a four player game.

I really dislike games in which kingmaking is so prevalent and in Liberte one player can greatly benefit other player just because, so that’s the main reason I’m downgrading its rating. Also I’m not sure how much the luck factor inherent in the cards impact the game. My copy of the game came with missing pieces but I could not contact the publisher for a replacement :(.

On the good side, Liberte flows very quickly with fast players, and the game mechanism are easy to grasp. You can try to win this year’s election or to set up yourself to win the next one, this is a neat mechanic. I also enjoy the alternate game endings, you have to be on high alert against them or they can take you by surprise. The rules are very simple but the game has a lot of depth.

The theme is irrelevant for me but I have to admit the game mechanisms fit it perfectly.

Bottom line, Liberte is an unique game but perhaps it isn’t for me. I honestly don’t know if I like it or not, so right now I’m downgrading its rating to 5.0 but I need to play it with players who really like it to see if I can enjoy it or not.

Current Rating: 5.0

RATING: 8
Simpler than many Wallace games, but still a brainburner at times as you try to pick out the best course of action. You need to keep an eye on which faction is likely to come first and second in each election and try to build influence accordingly, while taking into account the secondary routes to gain VPs and keeping an eye out for the alternative 'sudden death' victory conditions. The 'Dagger' variant is recommended to keep the deck turning over.

The basic mechanics are very clean, it looks nice in play, and the 3 different victory conditions mean those who have fallen beind on the VP track still have something to shoot for. Lots of period flavour too - many calls of 'off with his head!' as the guillotine falls as The Terror grips Paris...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very chaotic game, hard to get any kind of strategy going. The card colors and board colors don't match well and cause confusion. But, it's by my favorite designer and after multiple plays things are flowing and it's a lot of fun.
UPDATE: Sold it for $30 - needs more players than I usually have.

RATING: 8
Based on a couple of plays, this could quite possibly be my favourite Martin Wallace design.  Simple in scope, but complex in execution.  Lots of strategies make every game completely different, and it has just the right amount of luck.  Lots of fun to play too.

The rules are relatively simple, but the strategic choices are pretty rich. I think the card draw adds a nice element of luck and tactical manouvering. I do recommend using a variant rule to keep the cards rotating if nobody is picking the face up cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Although it is a area control game published in 2001 is surprising and allows many possibilities. However, the excess of areas (27) makes control difficult, and the cards causes too high randomness (I have to say that has been played using the old rules).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This was my first Wallace and I have fond memories of it. Likewise, it was the first really thematic euro for me (though not so much now) and I really appreciate the sudden death scenarios vs the standard, moderate victory. I do wish it was a bit shorter and not so clunky but that is the Wallace way is it not? 

UPDATE: played again recently (first time in 8yrs) and had forgotten how big luck of the draw plays into the game. I can see how you can plan for the arc (how many of which cards are in AvB decks) and through the dagger variant do a better job of sifting through cards. But if you don't draw well you're gonna lose. Still like the sudden death potentials though.

A good and fun game about political influence. The theme is installed really well and there're lots of little things that are exceptionally strong flavorwise but unfortunately the productional values suck. Keeping up with the colours of the board and the cards is difficult and at least I was forced to mark the purple set of player control tokens with white marker to be able to separate them from the brown ones in dim lighting. Also, the rules are written so that they are really hard to teach by reading rules at the same time. In the end, the game may become really chaotic and someone may lose something due to luck, but I still like it a lot. It is just about not trying to count everything. Just look at the board and see. Easily the best area-influence game there is, especially because it avoids stacking contests with very simple rulings.

Clearly a developmental work. The graphic design is also no great shakes; it reminds me of when you're watching a nineties movie and everyone's mooning over some woman with hideously big bangs. I always think, well, it takes place in 1991, so who cares if Penelope Ann Miller looks like someone is trying to hide a rolled-up newspaper in the hair over her face? But on the other hand, I'm all, did it never occur to anyone that this look might not last?

Anyway, the multiple victory conditions make it interesting; it's not overly heavy and does indeed seem to take around two hours if you aren't playing with people who have to update the spreadsheets in their brains, so hey, more Martin Wallace per hour than ever before!

Long ago I played this game.  It was  fiddly.  I had trouble evaluating the map, too many colors!  Neat theme, and I liked that there were two other ways to win other than the most victory points.  But the need to constantly count blocks in each region to play well was a huge drag. Traded away years ago.

Update: 2011 and I now own this again.  I've played it once and enjoyed myself more than I expected.  I'm eager to try again.

I have fun with this game. The theme comes through really well. There's tension as the radicals or the royalists try and end the game prematurely. 

I'd change the card-draw rules, to give players more choices and to reduce the luck factor. 

Besides that, it's wonderful.

The rulebook is difficult, but the game itself is much easier than it seems. Some interesting mechanics all together, no fiddly rules like Martin Wallace is known for, which is good. I love how you have to adapt to win, one round you can route for one side and the next you might have to go another side completely to win. But, then again, holding out the whole game for one side can benefit you overall too. Gives every player a chance to come back with the battles as an alternate way of achieving victory points.

After couple of games feels actually quite good: there is a lot of going on on the table and you can't be everywhere. Some problems too: it's hard to know which card is blue and which is purple (btw. same problem in Railroad Tycoon!) and very hard to "see" what is the overall situation on the board: which group is going to be the next government (and what's your position in that group), is it near that the game end because of special-end rule etc. Still, fun to play and I like it although this is not as good as for example Struggle of Empires BUT definitely better than Byzantium.

An excellent influence and elections game where players are vying for power in regions and provinces within using the Radicals (red), the Moderates (blue) and the Royalists (white).  Paris is sometimes a dogfight.  It seems to play well with 6, 5 or 4 players.  Another good Martin Wallace design.

You know, I've played a good deal of Wallace games, and yet I still didn't know quite what to expect.

It's a mixture of hand management, area control, and something totally indescribable.

There's an immense amount amount of information to process, not just as a first timer, but even throughout the game in general.

I think the most unique aspect was managing when to apply your cards for tie breakers. Further, creating intentional ties that you know only you can win due to having the proper colored card is nothing short of sinister.

It's a classic Wallace game that will surely see more plays in the future, but one thing is for certain: it's one of my top 5 heaviest games played of all time.

Tentative 9, with aspirations of a 10; just like Age of Steam began, and lived up to.

RATING: 7
You are trying to gain victory points by aligning yourself with one of three factions.  If those factions win the election over four turns, you gain points.  But there are some sudden death conditions where Royalists or Jacobins can win.  

The game is a majority control game where you trying to score points, but due to the sudden death conditions, even a player in last place is never truly out of the game.  

It has gone over well every time I have played.  I really like the game.  It is an excellent game.

RATING: 7.3
The several ending and winning conditions make the endgame on this one a thrill. You're often competing with others who want to end and score differently than you do.

Liberte would probably get a higher rating but I cringe at the thought of teaching it.

Area majority with a clever twist: you do not control any faction, but rather deploy them all and then try to have control of the most successful one(s). 
Interesting little touches (two possible alternative VPs-don't-matter victory conditions). 
A bit too much randomness (my own issue with many Wallace's games). 
Use a house rule to avoid having only "1" cards face up or the game can drag.
Colours could have been better selected to ease gameplay.

Liberté is a neat game covering the French Revolution in 1789. Above all, what makes this game stand apart from the rest are the unique paths to victory.

If they control seven key locations in France, the Loyalist Faction will win by counter revolution. If there is a radical landslide in an election (17+ votes), the Radical Faction will win. If neither of the above happen, the Moderate Faction will win through the election process via peaceful means (aka victory points at the end of the game).

There can only be one winner. However, these widely divergent means of winning will put you into a situation where you are in a necessary alliance with one or more players. If you are the only player working towards furthering the goals of a particular faction, you will most certainly lose.

Besides the above, other appealing aspects of the game are that the rules are tight, it is nicely produced and attractive, and is playable in a reasonable amount of time (around two hours).

RATING: 4
A standardish area majority game with a few twists and a revolting color scheme.

The cards that decide what you can do are unbalanced and drawn at random. Most of them show famous characters from the Revolution, but the link between flavor and function is very weak. Other cards show generic events, such as Religious Problems and Terror. These are extremely powerful in some situations but completely useless in others.

For the most part, the theme seems shoehorned, not very successfully, into the rather uninspired mechanics. An exception is the alternate victory conditions, which are flavorful and help make the game somewhat exciting. The main part is still fairly dull, though.

The colors of the cards don't match those of the regions, and the blue and purple cards are too similar. This seems like a very strange and unnecessary design mistake.

It's interesting to note that Marquis de Sade is a moderate.

Played one 5-player game with inconsistent rules enforcement.

Once again, Wallace does not dissapoint. I'll be the first to admit that this game went over like a lead ballon with my gaming group (they are heavy RPG/miniature players), however as with all richly themed games, I fell In love. People are so quick to judge how simple it is to simply lay the blocks on the board, however they fail to see the bigger picture. Rich theme, cards that are easy to understand, and some downright badass mechanics make this my 2nd favorite Wallace game behind Struggle of Empires.

Recent second playing left me much colder on ths one. At first, I guess the elegant mechanics left me blind to just how much luck and chaos the cards hold. After playing with a full group of six, didn't like this game nearly as much as I did with three.

Okay game, reminds me of El Grande in some ways but not as good.  I think I'd enjoy it more if I knew more about the French History and the character portraits.  Then it would be more fun playing on the taking of certain regions with certain characters who would/would not have done so historically.

An impressive game with a great theme. Unfortunately I find it difficult to find people to play this with. I don't think we've played it enough yet to receive the rewards I think it has to offer.

Viva la Revolution! I disagree with those who say the theme is pasted on. I take that to mean someone came up with some spiffy mechanics and then attempted to slap some pictures on it and make it look good. Like T&E you can see immediately where in this game the designer USED the theme to create mechanics to abstractly simulate them. I love the historical theming. The rule book is rather confusing, and its not for the feint of heart. It's not as tight and solid as some of his other games (first turn is weird set-up, sudden game ends can be surprising, luck of the draw seems to play more of a role) but it is still an engaging ride.

My favorite Warfrog.  I love the fact that you have three different victory conditions (and all are possible).  Although at heart this is a territory and card game the special cards evoke the French Revolution for me.  Perhaps a small problem with a bunged up card line, but I like the rules as written best.

A little bit abstract for me and the cards should have offered more variety. But the gameplay was intense, chaotic and fun. Too much benefit for the player who finishes the round. But again: Intense, Chaotic and Fun. Update 26.10: Outdated by today's standards.

My rating could rise with future playings since it was a very interesting game.  However, we played with 5 players and it was really hard to keep track of which colors were winning how many provinces.  Also, the game probably took 2 1/2 hours which is longer than I would prefer.

This game may seem a bit odd and is not a hit with everyone. The unclear colour matching on the cards vs. the board do not help either (apparently a 2nd ed. fixes this). But other than that, the game is simple, and does not take too long. Play a card, draw a card, manipulate the other players. One should always watch out for the counter-revolution: it regularly almost occurs by itself as the game progresses to the 3rd round, and players should take precautions accordingly - don't blame the game for not folding out the way you wanted to!
Liberte is the most fun if players approach it somewhat intuitively, not exactly counting all the blocks on the board every turn they get, and instead focusing on some overall idea. The counting will then be limited to the last period of the rounds, where ties can still be broken.
If you want an enthralling area control game for 4 or 5 players, and don't mind an extra rule here and there, leave El Grande on the shelf; go with Liberte.

Interesting first play, looks to have a lot of depth, but only a future play will tell me for sure.  Can I make a long-term strategy, or am I stuck with immediate tactics?  If the latter, the game won't make my shelf.  If the former, then it will ba another Wallace on the rack.

Update:  Well, I don't really 'get' this game, I guess.  The mechanics seem a bit dated or something, but I still don't feel too much control, and what I do is dictated more by the cards I draw. Not off my 'want' list, but would play again.

RATING: 7.5
Pros:
- Very tense placement
- I really like the way the victory point allocation/decision points ramp up as the game progresses
- 3 win/endgame conditions make for a very tense last turn
- Theme really well implemented
- Personal display is a very simple concept but adds lots of angst

Cons:
- Can be quite random; it is always better to draw a '3' card than a '1' card
- Sucks when you are trying to go for one colour/region but you just can't draw the appropriate card
- Can you really influence the outcome?

Verdict: must play again. Soon.

Whoa, a game structured around ties, creating ties, avoiding ties, but perhaps most importantly breaking ties.  What an interesting and fantastic concept.

The theme of the game is the French Revolution during the late 1700s, but hold on...it is not conflict simulation.  Instead, Liberte makes use of some very creative "abstract" mechanisms for players to make use of in their juggling of power between three factions over four election years:  the Royalists, Moderates, and ye ol' Radicals.  

What is interesting is that each player does NOT have a dedicated allegiance to any particular faction vying for power.  Instead, play flows around jockeying for position as the player who was most allied to the faction elected to power.  This forces focus not only on long term strategy, but also on tactical flexibility.

But wait, there is more.  Liberte has multiple game end conditions.  The game normally ends after four elections at which point the player with the most VPs wins...simple enough.  However, "radical landslide," and "counter revolution" conditions can cause the game to end immediately.  In either of these cases VPs are out the door and the player who most supported the dominant faction wins.

Fantastic.

RATING: 4
Liberté is essentially El Grande with an "investment" layer over top, a more integrated theme, and a couple sudden death endings. The concept is awesome, making this one of the strongest "want to like" (but don't) games I've played.

Unfortunately, the implementation results in an extremely chaotic, highly tactical game in which planning is nearly impossible, and all you're doing on your turn is a) recounting the piles of blocks, b) making an elementary and usually obvious decision about where to place your own blocks, and c) hoping nothing changes too much before it's your turn again. Sure, you can "plan" for a Royalist Counter-Revolution, but you have to luck into Royalist cards and even then it seems pretty easy for other players to stop you. This lack of control would probably be fine in a 30 minute game, but it makes two hours seem like a waste. 

There are a couple alternatives to Liberté. [boardgame=29937][/boardgame] can be done in 30 minutes, gives far more control to the players, and is also "El Grande" with an "investment layer." If you can get over the dice (or use my [thread=801119]diceless variant[/thread]), Wallace's own [boardgame=21954][/boardgame] also does the "area majority" + "stocks" thing. Or forget the "investment" stuff and play El Grande.

RATING: 7
First of all, this isn't the easiest game to learn and teach as there are some non-intuitive aspects of the game that make it difficult to keep in your head.  Some cards have text on them that fail to mention special conditions that are further clarified in the rule book.   Add to that the color mismatch between the cards and the board and you have the makings of a disaster.  The game might actually be okay if everyone knew what they were doing and it moved along at a faster pace.  Most of the problems including the color mismatch could be overcome with more experience playing the game. So my rating could go up with further plays.

RATING: 8
Once you wade through the rule book once, twice . . . maybe several times, the game is not the complicated.  It is an "abstract" election game that is feels like a CDG.  Given that there is not a ton of games on this topic (unlike European markets or Egypt-anything), this is a refreshing play.

Dynamic and fast game play, even for a 6-player game. No downtimes observed. Big advantage is a possibility to end the game on 3 different ways.

A very interesting area-majoriy game. Unlike El Grande that's totally open, it's harder to predict what your opponent want to do, because pieces are put into play via cards, which is one thing you can't see it coming, and another thing is you don't know what forces will be dominating. These factors make the game seems extremely tactical, but you have control of your hand for strategical move as well. Because the board can change rapidly, it's best played with 4.

2008/01/07: This is probably the deepest game I own. It's very difficult to realize what is going on at any given time during the game. I feel overwhelmed by the game as if I could not make any better playing it. With 5 players, this game is just amazing, but it requires a lot of experience from the participants in order to enjoy properly this precious jewel. It's not a 10 yet, but for sure, after I manage to understand it better, it will achieve the perfect rating for me.

RATING: 6.5
Area control game by Martin Wallace set in the France during the French Revolution. When players play soldier cards, they put 1 to 3 tokens of a faction (Radicals, Moderates or Royalists) onto a specific region of France (around 30 regions in the game).  When we first played this, we played this wrong and removed all tokens after every election (it is only tied tokens). Thus, the game took 3 hrs 30 minutes which we really hated, and I gave it a rating of '4'. With the correct rules, I am happy to report that the game plays  better. Some luck with the draw of the cards: the soldier/personality cards range from a strength of 1 to 3 troops, the special cards like guillotine eliminate other player's personalities. Game also seems to rely a lot on perception: current leaders are usually hammered (rightly or wrongly) by the other players. In this respect, the game can really be "in your face" especially if you are not even winning and you get hit by the terror/guillotine/purge/emigrate cards. A neat concept with the majority counting for elections, and okay as long as you don't mind the confrontational aspects of the game.

Perhaps the French Civil War actually erupted because the people were so fed up with the six regions of their country having such poorly chosen, easily mix-up-able colors.

Great game - lots of options each turn and never enough time to get all the influence you need! Anyone who rates this low needs to try the game again, a couple of plays are needed to understand the alternative options this game offers.

RATING: 5.5
The rules are very simple and the games is quite original in its concept, even if the mechanics (area control driven by cards, like in other Wallace games) are not.

It's a very smart game, with great ideas (the catch-up mechanism is very powerful, being last is huge, maybe too powerful), etc.

The theme is very present, and like in most Wallace games, it seems the theme came before the mechanics.

The components are nice, not wondrous, but they do their role perfectly. The cards are a bit unimpressive. 

For me, it shares the problem of most area control games: the actions of your rivals are more important to determine your outcome tan yours. If you do very well, they will punish you. They might punish you just out of pure [bad] luck, just because you are in their way.
In my first game, I got less than half total votes than the first 2 players just because I had bad luck and other players  placed their votes in my regions.

But the thing I hate the most it's the AP it promotes. It's not really AP, there are a lot of things to consider, and the controllers of the areas change constantly. If you want to stay up to date, you need to reevaluate constantly the board composition, and it takes A LOT of time. The solution is to play just "by feelings", but the player who counts the votes will get a huge advantage.

I feel really bad for the low rating. It's a game I recommend everybody to try, but these 2 problems are too important for me.

RATING: 6.5
First impression: Played one game with 6 players. It seems 6 might be too many players. With 6 turns are very fast (some only 2 rounds) and you therefore have relatively little control over game. Maybe better with 4 or 5 players. An ok experience even with 6 still.

Basically an area control but election system gives it some nice twists. Sudden death rules add also some variables to think about. Card luck can heavily penalize you in worst cases.

Card-driven influence tug-of-war with two rather interesting points: It's surprisingly quick, and there are three completely different winning conditions.

Decent game.  Players place faction markers into a number of different provinces.  The player placing a faction marker has control of it.  At the end of each turn, each province with one of more faction markers holds an election.  Whichever faction has the most control markers in a province wins the provincial election.  Players can play cards from their hand to break ties.

The faction that wins the most elections is the government.  The player that has the most control over the government gains 5 victory points, and the second most control gets 2 victory points. A player scores 3 victory points for having the most control over the runner-up faction.

As your faction markers score, they are removed from the board so that the winning factions always start weaker in subsequent rounds.  Although a full game is 4 turns, there are also a couple of game ending events that players might trigger to end the game early.  Some provinces generate bonus victory points and the player having the majority of battle markers in the battle box also gets victory points.

Minor gripes about the components: colours on board should have matched the cards and the rules have some typos.

Interesting Wallace. Quite abstract one tbh. This old design is definetly hurt by the new games easy see-though scoring and winning strategies, so most people don't really want to play it several times, as 1st game basicly just give you a taste of the possibilities and strategies that could be found in it. So it kinds needs a bit work from players to get and like it. (Work is a bit strong work here I guess, maybe more open-mindedness and willingness to let it and think with it while playing).

Pretty dry and subject to overanalysis by necessity, which makes a long game seem even longer. In order to maximize your turn you really do need to constantly analyze and count the colored blocks on the board so the game drags on and on and on. Add to that the fact that in spite of being first on the victory point track for the entire game, someone else can have a red landslide election (16 votes I think it was) and win the game because they have the most red. I really didn't like that mechanic at all that allowed a last place player to render the victory point track moot because red received 16 votes in the last round. Really dumb. I'd definately recommend trying someone elses copy first before buying it. Personally, I'd rather ram 18" knitting needles into my eyes than play this again.

Interesting because the midgame demands that the players evaluate their position in the point strategy and forces those in the back to adopt alternate victory conditions that ultimately have players forming working alliances to pull a victory.  In this way I feel that there are two stages of victory, the faction that one with the party leader chalking up the ultimate victory.

RATING: 6
A game that bugged me enough to trade away even though I rated it a 6. Solid design, solid gameplay, but the constant counting, counting, counting sucked all the fun out of the game for me. At heart it's an area majority game within an area majority game. Play cards to place pieces belonging to 3 factions/colours (red, white, blue naturally) onto the board across 28 or so areas. Determine which of the three colours is going to win the most areas. Get victory points if you've won the most areas for the winning colour. Each winning stack in an area loses a piece, and then repeat over 4 rounds. The main attraction is the lure of the factional wins for those falling behind in the VP race, where white can win instantly (aka the person with most white) if it controls 7 specific regions, or the person with most red can win instantly if it wins enough areas in 1 round. The lure isn't enough for me to like it more than I do other area majority games. It's the counting, counting, counting. Or don't count, be a random-in-hope factor, and go with the flow. Which will also probably be unsatisfying for you and the other players though.

Complex, deep, fascinating.  A lot here. I see comparisons to El Grande a lot in comments, and although they are both great, I don't feel they are worthy of comparison.  Liberte has a lot of voting and dealing with different factions and possibility of sudden death conditions. Makes it a very different and unusual game.

In my first game, I kind of blew it coming out of the gate. So I focused my energies on counter revolution-which very nearly paid off! (a flip revealed I could have had it if it came around to me again)  

Played with 3. I can imagine playing with 4 tops. Anything more seems like total chaos & would hinder playing enjoyment (for me, anyway).

Update 9 08. Played with 5. A little busy. I think 3 or 4 would be a sweet spot in this game.

RATING: 7.5
Based on one play: Try to gain control in each district in order to push one party to take control of the government. Points are very hard to come by since you only get points for holding the majority (or second most) of the party in control, so even if you win a lot of districts, you may not get any points. There is also one battle per round and some points to gain from winning certain districts as of round three. All this is done with cards, that are used to play party markers and then to break ties, which is one of the main mechanics in the game. Lots of ties will occur and the better your cards on the table, the more chance you have to break those ties.

Il punto forte dei giochi di Wallace sono le meccaniche. E anche qui, benché astrattine, queste rendono Liberté un gioco piacevole. Già dal secondo turno i giocatori devono stare attenti a dove piazzare, cosa piazzare e cosa succederebbe se il gioco dovesse finire subito. La fase delle elezioni è molto divertente e il suo svolgimento ricorda la nottata passata a vedere gli spogli delle schede in TV. L'effetto culo può essere determinante.

This is an area control game that really has a lot going on.  Players place influence markers that show support of one of three factions, and really only gain benefits if that faction comes out on top.  Players have to be particularly meticulous in counting markers to figure out what factions are ahead, or risk having their actions amount to nothing.  There's a fairly high luck factor in card drafting, as the power level of cards varies a lot.  The game also features variable ending conditions that each have variable victory conditions, which is something I don't really enjoy in games.

3 factions.
Players try to gain influence in all three to maximise point scoring at election time, and keep their options open for sudden death endings.
Additional point scoring on the "battlefield".
Alternate win-cons if it's all going to pot.
Emergent temporary alliances.
Good chaos.

Not knowing this game one might wonder it´s a thematic game about French revolution, but this is not the case here, it´s rather dry. Also this game has a lot of non-fun chaos where it does not make a case for excitement and laughs but instead make people scratch their head and feel their actions in the game are pointless. Maybe it´s slightly better with 3 players.. (I played with 5)

Not an easy game to pick up. I found it very difficult to read the relative strengths of both players and factions from the board. It was also difficult to anticipate just how much chaos there would be. I'd prefer to play Perikles over this.

Who can play?  Strategy game for 3-6 players.

I'm totally impressed with this game, based on my first two plays.  This very interesting area control wargame rewards deviousness and clever play.  It's murderously nasty and there are 3 unique ways to win the game, so everyone is in it until the end.  Best game of it's type so far.  My only complaints, it took some significant effort to figure out the first time, but once you get the hang of it, it plays quickly, and isn't as complicated as it seems at first.  Also, the color production is not right, and takes some getting used to - both the playing card/board colors not matching and the player pieces being too similar.

Have only played once, but I found it convoluted and unattractive.  Area control with a twist.  Has the king of all comeback chances.

Rating based on 1 - very, very frustrating - play (with 5). It rarely happens that I just want a game to end, but in this game I already had this feeling in round 2.;

It's very hard to see which color is winning and even if you see it, you still need to have cards with that color in your hand. I also think it's bad that the markers you place in the war zone with canons stay in play after a scoring. In our game one player put 5 markes in round 2 there and ,kaching, 12 points - and the victory - for him.

RATING: 7
Theme is an enticing one. The idea of the royalists having special paths toward victory provides alternative to winning, especially for those who are desperate. Enjoyed the area majority mechanic, along with the elections-related tract. But there's a lot to keep up with for a new gamer: Provincial elections. Overall Election. Personal Personalities and their future Influence. Special Event Cards. Battlefield semantics. VP Award tract. But the game surprisingly seemed to flow very well, even with so many new gamers at the table. (Of course, having someone who can easily explain the rules aided tremendously in the aspect.) My major fault is that I had a hard time determining just "who was likely to win the election", simply due to the large amount of items on the gameboard. In some ways, I found myself just wanting to push back from the table, blur my vision, and see which color visually "popped out". But I guess in some ways that the game mimics real life, and real elections...even though we may have inclinations about who might win, especially at the local level, it's a real crap shoot at the national level.

With the recent reprint by Valley Games coming out, I felt that I should reexamine my comments for Liberte.  I own the  original Warfrog version, which is nice, but the presentation is all wrong for me.  

The summary is that Liberte is a card-driven area of control strategy game where players vie for political control of the 3 major factions, each represented within France's 20-something provinces during the French revolution.

As players gain the most influence and if they are able to maintain control of key provinces, they will earn VPs.  What really makes this game different is that there are 3 different endgame options - a Royalist return, the Moderate succession, or the Radical overthrow.  With both the Royalist and Radical option, the winner is determined by who has invested the most into the winning faction as opposed to the moderate victory, which tallies VP.  So, this means the game can have some brilliant come from behind victories, where those who are clearly behind on VPs can still go for the win, and cause a 'mess' on the way.

There may be a tendancy for some players to count the activities on the board in search of the 'perfect' move.  Those AP'ers should beware and avoid - the game sways so quickly that a player must just have a 'feel' of the board, of their resolved control of various provinces, and act best on the cards they have to choose from.

Great premise, but functionally, from the Warfrog version standpoint, I'm disappointed in much of the art.  It feels so uninspired.  The box itself is stunning!  Inside, the board is very bland featuring 'Times New Roman' font throughout. There is a major colour problem between some cards and their matching provinces on the board. The cards themselves feel 'functional' before 'artistic'. The 3-card draw pile stagnates once the options there become weak.  I wasn't impressed with the rules and found those unintuitive. 

Therefore, with the new Valley Games reprint, there is certainly going to be a great game there.  A solid game system that really only needs a facelift and a bit of exposure.

In this elections game there are three political parties, the royals, the extremists and the moderates. You play cards to add vote tokens for specific parties to the board, and you want to ideally be the one who supports the winning party in the most spots, and also support the second place winner in the most spots. Ultimately you don't care which government is in power, you just care if they like you the best, as your success is based on having whichever side wins liking you best.

This game could be improved if the character cards had quotes on them from the people represented and if it came with more than one player aid in English, but those are minor issues.

Good area control game. We need to play it a few times to get the subtleties of the strategies. This is a deeper gamers game and not for the light hearted. Two critiques: the draw card mechanism can influence outcome at times (like one player getting 4 terror cards in a row on the card that gets flipped up). PLUS: the colours are horrible to play on, its way too busy, the map should have been a nice calm colour, neutral. Are you listening VALLEY GAMES?

Once you're past the french blue and french purple (and how they differ between the cards and the board), it is a great game. The varying victory conditions along with the numerous card executions really gives this a political feel. If someone is running away with the election and battle VP's, it's time to raise a full scale revolution or a counter-revolution so as to discard the normal VP count and substitute an instant radical or aristocratic power count for victory.

Each time I've played this I've enjoyed it more. Good balance between long term vs short term goals. That is, you can play for winning the election this year, versus setting up some surviving blocks to position yourself for the next year.
Like how the people on the cards carry the theme of  the game, and the mechanics follow in suite.
 
Particularly like the alternate endings strategies the player behind could try for the alternate victory condition - generally find the counter revolution to be viable.

Only complaint is who controlled the color of the cards and the map!

RATING: 6
Update: Downgraded from 7 to 6. I finally got the rules right for once.

Cons: 
* A bit too long and repetitive for what it is.

The problem is that the board "resets" after each of the four rounds. [This is wrong. I didn't realize pieces stay on the board if there is no tie. This, like all Warfrog games, has horrible, horrible rules.]

But this I still agree with: Even though there's a different selection of cards in later rounds, and you can save your more powerful cards for the next round, that still isn't enough to add variety between each round.

But still, it's repetitive. Play a card, play cubes.

* Clever mechanics, but they do not have any relation to the theme of the game. (Fortunately, someone who was playing with us was very knowledgeable about French history.) The "rule of three" (you can only control a maximum of three faction blocks per province, and only three stacks of faction blocks per province, etc.) is very artificial. The victory conditions, however, save it from being a totally abstract game with a pasted-on theme. The title is quite ironic, because the game is all about rigging elections with apparently little loyalty with the factions involved in the game.

In other words, strategically, the game makes thematic sense, but mechanically, no. Example: Why am I restricted by the cards in my hand when I play cubes? Why can I influence a province by a maximum of only three blocks? Why can only a maximum of three players can influence a province? The restrictions make the game work, but they really make no sense thematically. Why are blocks wiped out when there's a tie? But blocks stay when there's not?


Pros: 
* What does add variety between rounds is the alternative winning conditions. For instance, someone in the lead in victory points might have to fight against all the other players who are trying to accomplish the other victory conditions, which are easier to accomplish than it appears, especially with indirect help for other players. The other effect of this is that in the middle and end of the game, players are pursuing very different strategies, which ramps up the tension.

* Turns go by fast because many times during the game, everyone will be simply drawing cards. In that case, it's a little bit like Ticket to Ride (with a take-that element). However, this Ticket to Ride drafting mechanism  has its own flaws -- significant effect of luck, unwanted cards in the display.

The downside:
- The rulebook.

A pretty decent area control game that gives the player a lot of choices to consider.  A few things I would change would be either require the player to draw a face-up card then replace it, so they get used, or else change entirely to a draw-and-either-play-or-discard system with no face-up cards at all.  That may be 'unoriginal' but it works in hundreds of other games for a reason. Also, I'd prefer the turn order to just be clockwise and forget the variable turn order stuff as unnecessary.  Anyway, those small problems aside, it's a pretty good game.

I just love all the tension and table talk this game creates. Winning the battle seems easy but you become a target the very moment you play your pieces in the battle box. 

One downside is that the card display is a bit static. Card randomness is a bit swingy. Players should really balance out the game as much as they can and hurt the leader. Players really need to be careful here. There is still a chance for comeback with two additional victory conditions even if you are behind in points. This keeps everyone on their feet. 
 
The pace is nice even with five players. I actually enjoyed 5p-game even more than 4p-game. There is a possibility to count stuff but things change so much, so it is just better to roughly estimate. Overall I really like how the game flows and the card driven system&area control works nicely. The historical&political elements come out nicely and this is a really fun experience, no matter if you win or lose.

I've only played this once (with 6 players) at the local club in April 2014, and doubt I'll play it again any time soon. The mechanics of this were quite interesting - it's essentially an area control game, with the action driven by cards which you can choose to keep in your play area (up to a maximum of 4) for some potential bonuses, and with a couple of interesting sudden-death endgame conditions which lead to the game being scored completely differently from the usual way. Definitely a game where you need to watch what everyone else is doing in order to play well. I wasn't all that enthused by it, but as I said it was nonetheless quite interesting and I wouldn't be averse to playing again. Also, nice to see a Wallace game with no loans, or indeed money of any kind :)

Love the subject matter, but it doesn't come across in this game. The only thematic element to this game is the OPPRESSION you will feel through random card draws which GOVERN your every play. To add insult to injury (or as Robespierre would say, "remuer le couteau dans la plaie") the colors on the cards did not fully match the regions on the board in our version. This led to more than a few aborted/regretted placements.

Ein älteres Spiel (2001) von M. Wallace, das aus meiner Sicht zu wenig Aufmerksamkeit genießt: Jede Runde besteht aus einer variablen Anzahl von Teilzügen, in welchen bis zu sechs Spieler für eine der drei Fraktionen der Französischen Revolution (Royalisten, Radikale, Gemäßigte) in den französischen Provinzen Einfluß plazieren, der am  variablen Rundenende (die Runde endet, sobald von einer Fraktion keine Marker mehr vorhanden sind) in einer Wahl verrechnet wird. Angetrieben wird dieser Grundmechanismus von Karten, die u.a. vorgeben, in welche Regionen (die aus mehreren Provinzen bestehen) Einfluß gesetzt werden kann. Das alles spielt sich schnell (maximal zwei Stunden) und ist – trotz M. Wallace – durchaus auch thematisch ansprechend. Nebeneffekt: Man lernt auch unbekanntere Protagonisten der Französischen Revolution (zumindest namentlich) kennen.

This game is average at best. 
It’s thrown together - The battle box idea is weak and simplistic. The colors of the game are off... The card choice is totally crap and the mechanics are redundant and the game feels drier than walking through the desert. I'm not a big fan of these redundant region/province control games where the battles are decided by a few counters and a lucky card! Game could have and should have been much better.

An area control game with some random elements in placement. It%u2019s a bit chaotic, because the game situation are often very unstable. it surely fits the theme, it%u2019s a revolution, isn%u2019t it? There is a major victory condition (end of 4th turn) and VP counting, but there are also 2 alternate victory conditions that can happen suddenly during play.

I'm willing to give the game one more try, with three players.  With five, each player simply got too few actions each turn.  This cranked up the opportunity cost of each action dramatically, making the special actions a totally losing proposition, and favoring those who got the 3-cards unduly.  It was improved by the Dagger variant, but sadly not saved, I think.

RATING: 8
I liked the game very much. Especially the fact that there are 2 sudden death victory conditions are very good for tension and allow players who have no chance on winning by the *normal* victory conditions to remain in the game -- and to win! -- Counter revolution is simply great, because the luck of card draw is counterbalanced.

The only issue i have is that the game could drag if players start to over-analyze the game. Maybe it is good to accept the chaos-element and to play without long analyze (limit the time to 1 minute per playerturn).

All game mechanics fit together very well and the game is not only a mechanical dry construcition on the french revolution, but combines history and fascintating game play very well!

Recommended.

Have played a few times, I think always with 6 players.  I would like to like this game.  It seems like there's some good elements.  It's just that I'm not a big fan of games in which one makes lots of plays and when the scoring is done, nothing.  You can put 12-15 pieces on the board and come to scoring and zip.  Additionally, you really have to guard against a Royalist win.  If at least 4 people (of 6) are not making plays designed to thwart it, it's very easy to see it occur.  Reminds me of games like Big Manitou but with a board.  You can think about your plays all you want and all it takes is for the next player to undo what you did.  Games like this should have a short playing time.  Few players enjoy spending lots of time making plays to come up empty or see it all undone in a flash.

You feel too much at the mercy of the cards. You might see which way the game is going (especially impending counter revolutionary win) and not be able to adjust your strategy to thwart or jump on it because you have a hand full of cards for other factions or regions.

Also, moderates not having an alternate early win condition while the other two factions do can really make it difficult to focus on them once other players start trying to end the game early (and they will). 

I've played this twice, and both times it left a bad taste in my mouth. The second time worse than the first. While I agree it's thematic to the chaos of that time period, I prefer an area control game like Tammany Hall that gives you a lot more control and has a third of the rules that this game had. Still, I can at least understand why people could enjoy it, which is something I usually don't see in games I rate this low. It's just not for me.

I wanted to like it but it went on too long and was a little to abstract for me. I think that the luck of the cards can unbalance things too.

Card and board colours don't match very well and the cards are missing some details that are only in the rules book.

Bit like El Grande - but that's not my entirely to my taste either.

It is an interesting game but not one I would want to play to often.  It has a lot of kingmaking.  You have to constantly keep track of who is winning in any colors you are investing in as only first and second place matter.  Also the yellow cards are very powerful and can wipe someone out pretty easily.

Only played it once, so my rating could rise if I played it again...a good initial impression though.  I like the multiple paths to victory.  Only complaint - the colors of the board and wooden markers!

I think this is the best of the Wallace games. The production quality is on the dodgy side, but the game itself is the most thematic area control game out there. El Grande is better as a game, but the theme is pretty meaningless there, whereas Liberte's theme is well integrated.

RATING: 8
I'm going to say it's best with four players... because it was a lot better with four than with six. I find the 1-3 card values to be no problem at all. Far better than dice to introduce a random element. It all evens out in the end. And don't go counting every area when someone takes a turn. Enjoy the game and go with your feel, with occasional counting when things look critical. This isn't chess - the random draw of cards ensures that - don't over-analyse everything and you'll enjoy it and still be in the running for the win. Poor colour matching in Treefrog edition is aggravating.

The game is fairly scripted, which will throw you on your first game if you're not forewarned. Blue dominates early on, then red and white have a chance to end the game early. You'll be stockpiling the right cards to go for a red or white win, but looking to score points along the way in case it goes to the four turn end. The mechanism of certain blocks being removed from the board and being able to reuse four (potentially five) played cards is what makes the game. It allows for forward planning and gives the game a strategic feel.

A simple enough game that can play quickly as long as people don't use their turn to count colours. If players on their turn take the 10 seconds they need then the game will be ticking along and quite fun. With slow counting obsessed players it would be very painful indeed. It's not for everyone - the El Grande loving wife finds the colours all too confusing - but I like it because it's fast paced, got a few surprises and a lot simpler than you would think from reading the rules. Counting scores at the end of the turns can be a bit of a drag, or an exciting election - whichever way you choose to look at it.

Martin Wallace. What else to say?  Again a great game, this time the best pure area control one that I've played so far.  Deep, thematic and simple rules.  On top of that, a political theme, a genre that I really like.

My first play felt a bit dry, but after a few more plays this game is starting to grow on me. The theme is recognizable for those who love history, but will be rather opaque to most others. Liberte feels very much like a typical Martin Wallace game where one's hand of cards drives the game's decision space, while at the same time significantly constraining it. 

I have now played it with 3,4 and 5 players, and I think 4 players hits the sweet spot. With 5 (and I can only imagine 6!) the game becomes too hard to control and it starts to feel chaotic.

Early reaction, have not played with others yet: This game looks deep. The rules are fairly straight forward, simple, but the strategy I imagine will be very complex.

Surprisingly, to me anyway, this was my very first play of any Martin Wallace game. From reading what people have said about his games I was expecting something richly thematic but with a solid, fairly streamlined engine. I was a little surprised by how abstract the game felt. I think it may have been due to a lack of emotional investment in the game, since you didn't really control your own individual faction, but had everyone trying to manipulate all three factions to their favour. Hard to say. There were certainly thematic touches, and the multiple victory conditions I imagine played into the theming as well, but for some reason the game just felt like playing a sort of area majority/stock market manipulation hybrid. I really didn't have much idea of how best to play, so I poked around at the engine whenever it was my turn to see what happened.

RATING: 6
Jack of all trades, master of none. There's half-baked card-play (Ticket to Ride style, hampered by some cards being strictly better than others with no clever hook for managing them) and half-baked investments (hampered by chaos) layered on top of chaotic area majority where it's difficult to track the situation, and ties are common (due to 3-stacking limit) and mutually destructive. King of Siam seems to be a more refined version. Still, some fun to be had with creating chaos and tanking for weird outcomes.

Liberté -- Played once; four-player. While this has much in common with an abstract game, this is one game where theme made all the difference for me. The rules would have been incomprehensible without the theme, but the theme not only made the game playable, it makes it interesting! I was surprised by how much fun we had playing this.

Great influence game set during the French Revolution (1789-1799). Try to back the right political group to power, but make sure you spread your influence or you may be left out of the victory points. And watch those victory conditions because in the few times I've played this I've seen alternative victory conditions met despite my powerful grasp on the lead! Zut alors!

RATING: 5
[1 play] 5 player game. I wanted to enjoy this more than I did. My expectations may have been set unfairly high, and I am going to give it at least one more try. There is clever stuff here, but some clunky things too. 

The chore of teaching and learning the game means that I am unlikely to introduce this game to a wide range of players. Among people already familiar with it, getting it to the table will be substantially easier. However, there are so many great games out there available for play that a game needs to grab my attention in terms of fun, theme, and challenge. I'm not sure the rewards for the time invested will be there for Liberté long term. 

Most recent play 5-09-06 with Michael, Alex, Corey, and Rob.

RATING: 7.5
This game is a pain in the ass.  

Lots of fun little options, but many of them require the player to get certain kinds of cards from the luck of the draw to even bother competing.   Out of four rounds only three of them are worthwhile and it often happens that someone will not score any points in one of those rounds, effectively knocking them out of any chance for victory.  The drafting pile can just too easily get clogged with worthless cards.

That said when it works it is quite a fun ride. First, I thought it was ok but saw potential problems, then I didn't like it at all (as the game really dragged under the fickle draft), now I think it is great, but know that the game is very dependent on how the cards play out. 

Regardless, there really needs to be a clearing mechanism for the draft in the game.  

UPDATE: AHA! The Dagger Variant solves most of my problems with the game, now I can feel comfortable with it just being and enjoyable, but clunky, lesser Wallace game.

A wonderful area control game from the new master Mr. Wallace. Plays fairly quickly for a game of such depth and breadth. Initially played the tied votes faction block removal wrong so looking to play again...correctly. The guillotine, terror, purge cards are all great for screwage. Love it.

Played again with 6 and still got the rules wrong. This time with Paris and number of votes in the vote tally.

My one gripe here is that the rules are just awfully written. Wallace has gotten much better over time with his composition and clarity but this is a poor example of information design.

RATING: 9
I'm not sure how I feel about this yet, but I'm dropping from a 9 to an 8 after my second play.  That's a 3p and 4p game.  We played it straight the first game, and a bastardized Dagger variant in the second.  Next time we'll try with the CORRECT Dagger variant and see how it goes.  For those who have no idea, it's a weuro based on the French Revoluion, and is truly a labor of love.  My sole concern is about cardplay and whether luck plays too much of a role in this longish game.  I can't see it dropping below an 8 for me, however.  

Update, after a 6p game:  Ok, luck does play a major role, but I think your decisions play a larger role, so it avoids the "too long for what it is" tag with me.  And I don't own another game that has generated this level of tension throughout the game.  I can see that the learning curve is rather steep for good play.  I hesitate to use the word "optimal" because you can only manage so much in each round, and the cards are, well, cards.  But you have to commit to some kind of strategy in each round, and you'll probably be drawing cards during and between rounds, so, ultimately, you live and die by what's in your hand, and by the hand of anyone who perceives you as a leader or a threat.

Plays OK with 3, great with 4-6.

Liberté has the distinction of being the best example of horrible graphic design in my collection. More inconsistent patterns than I can count, tacky use of drop shadows and emboss effects, and awful typography and contrast. Yep, it's the Valley Games edition that was supposed to improve the looks of utilitarian Warfrog production.

However, I'm keeping the game strictly on its merits as a game. Visual design notwithstanding, it's a wholly unique game design with scintillating historical flavor. That's worth something.

edit#3: OK. I surrender!!!

The most wonderful experiences I've ever had playing a board game were with Liberté. A very, very special game.

Cards can be decisive to victory and a bit of king making is also possible in some games, specially 3 player games but I still like to play Liberté and it is one of those games in which I don't mind losing because of whatever reason because I have fun always and everytime I play it. One of the great things I feel in this game is exactly the fact of having the same amount of fun and strategy that a great game requires.

Trying to understand Liberte from a read of the rules before playing is like looking at the face of a tourbillon watch and then being shown the movement behind it - Theres just so much going on that's not obvious at first sight. Close to a masterpiece - however, the card drawing mechanism feels a bit clunky (even with the Dagger variant), it feels out of place in such an intricate and deep game.

Great game--play with the Dagger Variant to great results.  So far 3 plays--1 Counter Revolution, 1 Radical Landslide and 1 VP win

Wow, does this game improve with experience.  The gameplay and victory paths are complex, subtle, and devious.  This game is GREAT.

The game is really good with 3, but like many games like this, you really have to balance on a razor edge to play well with just 3 because the power is more diffuse with more players.  So even though competition for control is greater with 4+, you need to really focus on keeping each other in check with 3--there is far less room for error.  So I can understand why the ratings can fluctuate, depending on the player counts people play with, and if you just want to focus on your own progression and not worry about stopping or slowing the other players, 3 is NOT the number for you--the more the better in that case.

Once you get past the baffling rulebook, the truly ridiculous province and card colour schemes, and the squintingly small card text, there's actually a fairly simple and decent game to be played.  It might take a while to get through the first turn, but once players have gotten the various nuances sorted out, the game rolls along at a pretty good clip.  As far as "area control" games go, "Chaos in the Old World" and "El Grande" are more interesting games, but "Liberte" beats them for ease of play.  It's not a terribly exciting game (I didn't ever get the feeling that I was either participating in, or attempting to prevent, a revolution), but there is plenty of player interaction and a decent amount of ebb and flow as the game progresses.  If only the physical components didn't make the game more puzzling than it needs to be!  Game design: 3/5  Personal enjoyment: 2.5/5  Total: 5.5/10
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Simple, clever area majority game made interesting by three victory conditions: points, revolution (radical supermajority in parliament) or counter-revolution (monarchist control of certain areas). Additional historical flavour is provided by cards featuring names/likenesses of various French personalities, and special actions like "Bread Shortage" and "Purge".

I'm a bit put off by the lack of control inherent in the random card draws, and the first game felt a little like stumbling around in the dark with no idea what to do -- at any given moment the situation is, appropriately, a highly uncertain morass of competing incentives and hidden information. Achieving a counter-revolution is one thing; ensuring that you are its leader is much harder.

All up, a very interesting game.

Nice game mechanics spiced with nice theme, and a nice twist that you always have a chance of winning the game - even if you are trailing badly on your victory points. In my view, the only downside is the random factor of the cards you draw. Getting continuously bad cards, CAN screw you over. But that pretty much goes for any game with a random factor.
- No player elimination.
- Everyone has something to play for until the very end - regardless of your score.
- Great theme that doesn't feel "pasted on".
- Perfectly playable in 2-3 hours, making it possible to pull out on an everyday evening and still complete before bed.

Martin Wallace is a fun-murderer extraordinaire.  He has a penchant for designing games that I really like mechanically, but are incredibly unfun to play.  This one falls firmly in that grasp.  I hate not drawing cards that really help me.

RATING: 8
Card-driven area control exercise set during the French Revolution. The cards depict areas of France and one of three different political parties, the Radical, the Moderates, and the Royalists. By playing certain cards the player can then place between one and three blocks in a particular area in an attempt to control it. Once one of the three parties' blocks are exhausted there is an election and victory points are awarded to players according to which party has control of the greater number of areas. I particularly like the way in which there are three different ways in which the game can be won meaning that 'Liberté' isn't just an exercise in accumulating the most victory points, so that a player who has been unlucky with the initial elections can find another route to winning. This is such a simple game to grasp in terms of the way it plays but there is so much underlying strategy that results from the gameplay too.

Played 3+ times. Political area control.  Would almost buy after first play.  Very clever. Two stacks of the same color in a province controlled by two different players can create some strange games.  Our last game was very weird, with rounds 2, 3 and 4 all ending VERY quickly by exhausting blue (lots of blue hanging around on the board - 2 blue stacks in several provinces).  2008/09/21

Along with Perikles, I think that Martin Wallace's 'Liberte' is a near-masterpiece of a deeply strategic euro/war hybrid. Love that players support various competing factions (Royalists, Radicals, and Moderates) in the attempt to accomplish the various victory conditions. Makes for lots of replayability.  Layers of strategy here... Though a certain elegance may be sacrificed in this game, it is in my opinion a justifiable sacrifice; the phase-dependent rules work to support a sense of narrative movement within the game, even though the historicity may seem a bit threadbare.

Didn't go over so well with my friends when we played it (just once).  I'd like to try again, but I doubt they'll play again, so I have to find some new friends to play with.  :)

Update:  After playing it again and having a little more familiarity with influence games under my belt, and playing with people who had some idea of what they were doing, I like this game more.  I still will need more plays before I can say just how good this is, but for now it gets a bump up.

Update 2: Played the game again.  Rounds 2 and 3 almost caused Radical Landslide, which would have won me the game, but as it was, we ended via the VP method, where I lost by 2 (I came in 2nd).  Definitely an interesting game.

(upon further reflection) This is an interesting game, but one that seems to be hard to get to the table.  There are quite a few semi-disjointed mechanisms here (granted, this reflects the actual revolution) that make it kinda hard to teach or have desire for.  The card drafting seems somewhat flawed, too, as in La Citta.

This is also fairly difficult to get to the table.

I also liked the way the three different factions keep everything in balance. It makes for multiple potential paths to victory. And the way the game plays out will be different every time because of this. 

Deciding when to, and planning for the play of the right cards to put in your personal display is a critical aspect to the game, one which I would love more opportunity to get better at.

I'll be keeping this one around. Wallace has hit my sweet spot, yet again.

I LOVE THIS GAME.  

I only wish that the learning curve were not so steep and the play time were shorter so that I could play more.

Liberté's steep learning curve comes from how opaque the goals are and how to get there. Opaque is not the same as a large decision tree. It is that one isn't sure which direction to set out in unless you've played it a few times. There are so many unknowns.

Most games help players get started by seeding the board in a way that gives every player a certain advantage or giving each player a power that directs your opening strategy. Not so here. It makes it hard for new players even after a full play.

And once you've determined what you want to do it is hard to steer things in the direction you want. Opponents keep tweaking the game state in a way that is constantly forcing you to pull the game back in your direction. You must have a strategy, but you also need to bend with the game. Otherwise it is like trying to land a plane when the rudder is shot.

Find an opponent who is moving in your direction and work with them. Subtly. Once it becomes overt, your screwed because everyone else will try to stop you or take the game all the way in one direction and win on one of the immediate victory conditions.

The only reason it is not a 10 is because I can't get it to the table.

By the way, the much discussed color problem (original Warfrog edition) is not as big a problem as you might fear.  Yes, it is a bit confusing at first, but people really do figure it out pretty quickly as long as you explain it to them.

Update: I did get the Valley Games reprint. The color problem is solved and the overall aesthetics are improved, though not everybody agrees.



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 4
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 1


Overall - 1

RATING: 8
Much better than the explanation of the ruleset gives you to believe. 

The early French Revolutionary period is a difficult one ot cover but the game is a pretty good stab at it and has enough period detail (as usual with MW games) to prevent you from thinking that it's all about the mechanics. 

My mate Graham - who's both a mathematician and a confirmed gamer - has had some nice things to say about the game and its mechanics, and I concur with him.  

Does the job. Like the period? Get it.

RATING: 7.75
Interesting game with a variety of winning conditions that can be troublesome with 5 players, as corroboration can wrest the game from the clear winner.  I would like to try this more with 3 players.  Components are generally nice, but are unfortunately marred by a horrible color mismatch between card colors and board colors.

Maybe abstract area control games just aren't my thing.  I was also decidedly underwhelmed by the even more highly regarded El Grande.  On the other hand, I do quite like Web of Power and China.  But in a nutshell, this game just didn't do it for me.  I get what Wallace was shooting for, and I suppose he may even have hit it, but the game seems to require either a ridiculous amount of counting up of blocks and calculation of majorities every turn (which would result in a multihour death march of a game) or a light casual approach (which is decidedly random and unsatisfying).  A much more minor quibble was the number and effect of the special cards, which really ramped up the chaos inordinately.

I suppose I'd play again, since I'm in theory willing to give almost any game a second chance, but playing for a second time is so low on my list of gaming priorities that I doubt it will happen in practice.

Liberte is a fantastic area control game where every player can deploy the Royalists, Moderates, and Radicals to control the 30 or so different regions of France.  Over the course of four turns you aim to have the most control over the faction that is the most powerful by playing cards, but what makes it really interesting are the two alternate ending conditions, which can trigger the end of the game prematurely if either the Royalists or the Radicals gain a certain amount of power, in which case victory points are ignored and the winner is only determined by who controls the most of that faction.  It's interesting because you always have to keep your eye on the different ways the game can end.  It's a clever game that I wish wasn't out of print and definitely want to play again.

Liberté covers the French Revolution from 1789 and the meeting of the Estates General to the Directory and Bonaparte’s coup d’état in 1799. 
The game is played in four turns. In each turn there will be a variable number of rounds, followed by an election to see which faction becomes the government. There are three factions, the Radicals (red), the Moderates (blue), and the Royalists (white).

Any game that demands 100% of my concentration for an hour and a half will likely win me over.  Liberte is engaging, challenging, and filled with head-slapping moments of realisation.  The map is better than average (though the colours are awful to the point of being indistinguishable), and the cards, which feature real revolutionary figures, are among my favourites in all of gamedom.  Simply great game.

Board is too hard to see; don't buy this until the Valley Games reprint is out and proven.

A Euro game but with a little more complexity and substantially more theme than most. I'd say it's at its best with 5 players but it's very good with any number from 4 to 6. The drama that builds as players try to work out which faction is going to win, who to target to change things around and what the results of tied elections might be makes for a uniquely enjoyable and entertaining game.

Martin Wallace warns the reader of the manual that the game might appear quite chaotic on the first page or so. And now I know why. The first time I played this game, the rules were thoroughly read and understood and I played with veteran gamers, but the game still felt confusing. Half-way through the game we were all still guessing at a strategy that could be deployed. In the end, it all boils down to assessing the situation on the board and correctly guessing which party will biggest at the end of the card playing phase and then trying to have a major "share" in this party. I do not have anything against abstract games, but this game feels very, VERY dry. At the end of the day, there are so many majority and share speculation games I like (a lot) more, that I do not see myself giving this a second chance. MAYBE if someone else would suggest it...

Rather disappointing game for me. Had a 4 player game and didn't really shine. There was a run away leader in the game and catching up never seem to be possible. The counting of faction was tedious and uninspiring. Very disappointed with outcome even though it was highly rated. However, game does feel historical. More plays are needed to alter the score.

RATING: 6
Liberte is one of those games that makes you feel smarter after playing it. Like reading an encyclopedia. The theme sounds promising - French Revolution? What could go wrong with that? Unfortunately, while the game play is fairly good, it's as dry as a three day old baguette.
The game also suffers from an extremely poorly written set of rules, and a players eventual success is tied far too closely with their initial random card draw. 
I enjoyed it, but would've rated it much higher if there was more inter player cut-and-thrust. Or chop.

An excellent game, although I'm a big fan of area majority games. Tammany Hall and Dominant Species are competitors for Liberte's play time, but there is enough unique about this one and I enjoy the French Revolution theme enough that I still find time for Liberte. I don't get the strongest sense of a narrative from this game, but it's there. Of course you have the incentive creation / emergent factions aspect that I love in games. The theme is great, although massively abstracted. It's awesome to me that a player can be in last by score, but still have every chance of winning by one of the sudden death win conditions. As mentioned, it's not clear what our perspective is but that's not a dealbreaker for me. This is definitely in the thematic euro category more than the wargame/simulation category, which is fine.

An area control game with actual thematic value (IMO most area control games have very pasted on themes). Alternate win conditions for the Loyalists and Radicals add a lot of extra tension.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I like it a lot.  The alternate game winning conditions are a real fright, as they are quite likely to happen if players don't look out.  Poof!  There goes all the hard work of winning those election and battles and provinces, because now VPs count for naught.  Because of this, it can be very difficult to tell who is winning.  I enjoy this, but it can make the experience very frustrating for some players who like a bit more transparency.  Surprisingly fast, and entertainingly tense.  If you don't end the game with the alternate victory conditions, every VP will matter, which means that every block you place will matter, which means that every tie you choose to break will matter.  I feel like I'm confronted with a juicy choice every time I have to make a decision.

RATING: 4
Take one part area control, one part wargame, and then ask the question: Will it blend?  The answer is yes.  This is a unique game that does a fairly good job of capturing the feel of the French Revolution, right down to the shift in momentum of the politics, and the unpredictable whims of the public.  The varying victory conditions allow for different outcomes, and the card deck prevents the game from becoming repetitive and programmed.  Unfortunately, the card draw can dictate a lot of the flow of the game, which can play a big swing in the course of events.  Plus, since I'm not a tremendous fan of wargames or area control games, there's not a lot of stuff here to keep me interested.  That being said, I wouldn't turn down a chance to play this (not all the time, at least).

An extremely entertaining political/area control game. It is pretty chaotic, but that fits the French Revolution theme. Incredibly hard to play well, for the situation is always in motion and there is a constant need for changes in strategy. The "sudden death" victory conditions are an outstanding touch.

Only one play so far. My initial reaction is not favorable. We played a four player game with one player getting a bunch of strong cards and myself getting very weak ones. Maybe my strategy just sucked. I would play it again to see but if the next game goes like the first I wouldn't be inclined to try it again. The board is a little hard to keep track of everything that is going on as well.

Second game- still not a fan. Again we had some issues with the rules. The rule book is very bad. Not one I'll be anxious to play. I actually reduced my rating on it.

Uno dei migliori giochi di Wallace, grafica pessima per il resto è un gioco di maggioranze che nulla ha a che vedere con il tema, cioè la rivoluzione francese, ma l'utilizzo della carte garantisce moltissima interazione e capovolgimenti. Bello.

There's a lot of data to absorb while playing which requires taking regular mental counts because a cursory glance at the board won't cut it.  That alone diminishes the game in my eyes.  If I could play this game more intuitively and by the seat of my pants, I'd better appreciate it's cleverness.

I need to play again to give it a fair rating. I think it played a bit more chaotic than it will in future playings since we were all new.

10/3 - Lowered my rating from a 7 to a 6. With more play it's just not quite a game I'm willing to come back to for more. The random elements of the card draw, especially at game start, often dramatically effect the final outcome.

Lowered again, this time to a 5. Just too chaotic for my tastes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fascinating game.  Chaotic, but some of that can be mitigated.  Optimal strategies are elusive, which is appealing.  Can be soured by consistent bad draws, but is largely self-balancing with some diplomatic effort. 

But at the end of the day, just too hard for me to get on the table, mostly due to the theme, but also the overall complexity. One that has to be played several times in a short span to get anything out of it, and...it's not good enough to justify that.

This game ahas differents ways of achieving victory. Every play is different. Last time I played two powerful Royalist parties made a swift counter-revolution in front of two naive opponents who could only cry after the loss of their useless victory points stored up. The previous one a Red wave cleared up France from Royal nobility. Very good simulation as well as  game. Congratultations to Martin Wallace and his team...

War game set in the French Revolution. Radicals and Royalists. Card driven area control. Play a card to place factions in regions, draw a card, resolve conflict with generals, "advance" cards to resolve elections. Repeat four times. Rules are tough to get through. Fiddly to a non-wargamer. Three end game winning conditions is excellent.

Takes a bit of getting used to, especially placing the faction blocks in the region provinces, but apart from that this is quite a good game with many decisions to make. More plays will make my appreciation better still.

Played two 6 player games and was very impressed with the speed factor of this game with so many players. We didn't suffer any downtime, which is usually quite high in most 6 player games.
We had a landslide victory in one of those games. There were 5 stunned losers after that victory because the winner had NO victory points before the landslide hit.....GREAT!!

Rarely I played a game that feels radically diferent from any other game I know, Liberte give me that.

There´s no many rules, only cards a map, some wooden cubes and a historical theme, but the dinamics and all that happen with so little footprint makes this game awesooooome!!!

The posibility to have 3 different endings base on the decisions of the players is genious!!! and also that you can change your strategy in the middle of the game and still win.

RATING: 8
Apparently quirky, chaotic area control games are just my style.  Trying to strike a balance between boosting up a party for points but keeping it from causing (or trying to cause) the instant victory conditions while managing your hand for the next round and still having a presence in the battle box is quite an experience.  In my first game the hand limitations also managed to stave off the likely AP problems a game this busy should cause.  Unfortunately this is a bit harder both to learn and play than something like Tammany Hall so wasn't making it to the table and was traded away.

Rating based on one play; I'm not sure what to make of all of the chaos.  Even though I came from behind and tied for first place (ended up second).  How much actual control is there in Liberte?  Can you formulate a long-term strategy that actually works?  It remains to be seen...but I like it so far. Update: I don't like this as much upon second playing.  Too much lack of control sours me to the whole experience.

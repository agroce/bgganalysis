GAME: Corps Command: Dawn's Early Light
RANK: 4068
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I am still not sold on the Corps Command series mechanics. While they are quite interesting and unique, it also is what makes them fiddly and foreign to anyone who ever played any other grand tactical level game. This one is even different a bit than the previous one in the system (Totensonntag I believe it was called) which is fairly strange. Another annoyance I have with this one is the counter setup mnemonics which are completely screwed up (meaning it takes half an hour to setup simply because it is quite non-intuitive).

Other than that, a fairly enjoyable game (once you do finish setup...sigh) but I don't see it hitting the table often.

This is an out-of-the-box rating... amazing component quality... everything looks beautiful.  Rules seem very clear on the initial read.  I will revise this rating after a couple of plays but at least for now I am impressed.

This game deserves more attention from the wargamers community. It is a small, fast playing game based on a solid and easy to grasp system. The activation system makes every game unpredictable. THe chits system are also another important strategic factor. The map is nice, well conceived and with boxes tracks to make easier the game experience. My only complaint is that it comes with only one player aid card and that it is not easy to differentiate between armored infantry and tanks, there are no symbols: both have a vehicle on on the counters, and you must learn the shape of the vehicles to differentiate unit and nationality...

I liked Totensonntag, the first game in this series.  The initiative system that was at the heart of that game gets another outing here and again works well.  Dawn's Early Light adds some modern warfare embellishments such as defensive fire and a variety of assets (handled in a similar way to FAB: The Bulge), without adding significant complexity. It's nice to have a range of scenarios, though a greater variety of protagonists would have been welcome.

As in Totensonntag, the counter artwork is very pleasing and Dawn's Early Light doesn't have the earlier game's issues with reading tiny unit designations.  The paper map won't win art awards but is reasonably functional.  The rules are an easy read, though I found a few details unclear.

Easy to play, beautiful components, and enough variety to make even replaying the same scenario interesting.  Core rules are not terribly complicated, but interesting enough to make the game fun.

Fast, furious, and fun.  I loved it and appreciated the time the designer took to teach the game.  Detailed review over here:  http://talk.consimworld.com/WebX?14@587.BUjtaqLFesS.47@.1dd29e81/552

And quite hilarious that one commenter below accuses the designer of ripping off Lock'n'Load's World At War series, when they're published *by the same company*.  This was  intentionally designed to take place in the same universe, with the explicit permission of the guys who 'owns' that universe, unlike the disgruntled commenter below...

(2010-10-30) it's a very well done game -- I've not played a game this clean for a long time. We had no questions we couldn't find answers for in the rules or player's aid card. I occasionally had trouble telling rough terrain from clear terrain, but it wasn't a big deal.

On the down side, as the Soviets I got my butt kicked.  Gary either completely outplayed me, I had no clue what to do, or both.

I like the different approach to rating units by morale and command capability that yields a simpler but effective combat system.  A very fluid and surprisingly nuanced game all on a 11" x 17" map!   All they have to do next is create an expansion to include the BAOR units.

RATING: 7.5
This is the classic 1980's Cold War gone hot. I really enjoyed the Team Yankee novel and this title captures the conflict perfectly. The system is easy to learn and a lot of fun to play. This is one of the great what if's of my childhood and teen age years. A must for anyone who watched "The Fourth War"  or Red Dawn.

RATING: 6
More Corp command, nothing to see here. These games are probably alright for the right gamer, but they just lack any real operational feel and any real scale. Units "fire at each other" which feels completely wrong at this scale. The initiative system while kind of clever again feels odd, as it seems to simulate command at an operational scale, again odd. The whole design doesn't mesh, much the same was as the previous game in the system. Still it is easy to play and has nice components, but it lacks many redeeming features, being small scale (which is the biggest sin in my mind), having terrible combat resolution and awful feel, I'd give it a pass unless you aren't a wargamer (than it might be ok).

After feeling a bit tentative at first about my recent purchase, I decided it's really quite accessible and fun to play. the gameplay seemed a bit foreign to me at first (no CRT), but after a practice session it flows really well.

Looks less impressive compared to its predecessor "Corps Command: Totensonntag", especially the map. Instead of a mounted map DEL provides a paper (though sturdy) map.

RATING: 8
Great fast paced game that finishes easily in one sitting.  The Combat system is unique and does well at portraying the deadly nature of modern battle.   The game is very fluid and momentum can shift between players due to activation numbers, reinforcements, assets or combats.  A lot of fun without a lot of rules weight.

Very interesting game. We like initiative mechanic quite much. It is shame that there are not more differencies in unit types and units are generally quite uniform.

Also it is quite lot random - initiative, combat, asset chits.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Beautiful presentation (in a strangely large box) but the unit ratings are very generic and seem utterly unrelated to the historical subject. I would have loved this at age 12, but hard to picture bothering to play it now no matter how good the rules are.

A better game than Totensonntag, feels like a modern SPI quad game:  low complexity, fast playing, smaller map, low number of counters, so don't expect a detailed simulation.  Gameplay as a result, feels abstract.

A decent introductory level wargame.

---------------------------------------------------
Game system has a few additions/improvements since Totensonntag.  

Rules additions:  defensive fire, assets.  Compared to Totensonntag, DEL has more scenarios (5 vs. 1) and more units so I think if you're interested in the system, I'd go with DEL.  Looks like a solid introductory level wargame with the usual sharp looking graphics we've come to expect from LnL.

Map is printed on heavy, glossy paper.  Wished they used a mounted map like the earlier game but they might've avoided doing so due to complaints about warping (not my copy though).  A cardstock map like Avalanche Press or Columbia games would've been better as well.  

Counters are thicker than the earlier game and look good.  Large box, which I like (good for storing a couple of my folio and magazine games plus counter trays).

Great addition to the series.  I think this has improved on Totensonntag in every way (and T-Tag is a solid game in terms of rules and mechanics).

Rules are essentially the same but with the addition of defensive fire which does well to showcase the lethality of defensive fire in modern war, keeps the attacker honest, and gives a good account of how terrain can impact the fight (tanks are better in open terrain while infantry and better in close terrain).

DEL has also added asset chits which will allow both sides to bring on airsupport, gunships, artillery, or reinforcements.  The rules covering this 'chrome' are between minimal and nothing new at all to know.

Disclaimer : I did help with some basic testing on this.  And modern war games are better than WW2 games!

Better than CC:T, but not by enough for me to rate it a point higher. Scenarios pit NATO quality against Warsaw Pact quantity. They try to give you a story, but it's actually a bit cold to me. Maybe operational isn't the best scale for this sort of thing. Still, easy to learn and fun for a few plays. Your cat can live in the big box.

I really love this game. Congratulations to Peter Bogdasarian for this elegant design. One of the easiest system to learn out there but still fun and exciting. Good balanced scenarios with fine replayability although I suggest NATO for experienced gamers and soviets for begginers. For future upgrades I suggest to use colored dice, red for Pact, blue for NATO so it is possible to save time on AN rollings. Do not hesitate in buying this one!!

It looks pretty, it's fun, and it plays fast. Combined-arms (in terms of artillery, air support, etc) are pretty abstracted. I'm not sure what I think about the imaginary geography.

Crystal clear rules.  Interesting twist on Corp Command system.  Nice big, thick counters and large hexes.  Art doesn't thrill me.  Disappointed in large box, since a great thing about Totensonntag was that one could easily throw it in a suitcase or carry-on.  (Relatedly, I'm disappointed in the paper map.)  NATO defense is an interesting challenge.

RATING: 8
Edit: Played a second time and game was much more balanced, also plays well as a three player game with  NATO split between the US and West Germans. Beautiful map, counters, and full color rulebook;game plays quickly if you are familiar with Totensontag. Game also has 5 scenarios so it provides more variety than the earlier game.Random chits adding more weapons and varible reinforcements is simple but elegant; the defensive fire mechanism is also unique and adds to battlefield uncertainty without the addition of complex rules.The box is too big, I prefer a Totensontag size box if possible but that is a minor quibble. Looking forward to more games in this series.This is also a great game to introduce newcomers to hex based wargames, playing time is in the 3 hour range.

Odd game with its scale.

I like the system and I like the subject.  Component quality was good as well.

Rules are easy to grasp and the scenarios appear to be fairly balanced (coming down to the last turns and both sides with a chance to win)

Need to get it to the table more.

RATING: 7.9
A nice edition to the Corp Command line with a hypothetical conflict that ports over well in terms of game mechanics similar to Tottensontag.  If you like the World at War series, this one provides a more grand tactical approach to game play but it's still all about modern tanks shooting it out, just on a larger scale.  I'm disappointed that they didn't provide a mounted map with this game.  The map is thick paper at best and I wouldn't qualify it as cardstock quality when compared to maps from Columbia Games for example.

1st play: I can see the appeal here as a kid's game, but I'm not sure how much it would actually get played. Thankfully the rules are simple enough, and I think it would go over very well with kids and muggle adults alike. I'll keep an eye on it and pick it up if it's on sale.

Kids love it because it involves whiteboards. Big problem is that it is pictures and when you sit around it, some people are upside down which makes drawing pretty damn hard!

RATING: 5
It's quite clever - there's no doubt about that.   Really, it's a pretty great kids game, and I think I could enjoy from time to time in that mode.   I won't ever score well in this game, unless the patterns are able to be gridded out in some mental or measuring fashion.   Variants with timers could be punishing or fun, depending.   In the end, it's a little closer to activity than game for me.

RATING: 7
This is an outstanding Family Game. I think we will be playing this a ton. The idea is that each person gets their own drawing board, and they have to draw a line that meets the specifications of each challenge.  That means the line has to touch certain objects and avoid others, for example, and all this has to be done by just looking at the example and using your spatial abilities. It's a great game for both kids and adults. I think ages 5+ can play this. My only criticisms are that the game plays with 4 people maximum, when it would have been so easy to add an extra set of components or two to allow up to 5 or 6 players, and I think it could have had a few more drawing challenges in it. But hopefully there will be an expansion soon. This is a fantastic filler game (and with more boards, it would be a good party game too).

I absolutely love this game.  It's such a great concept to take what appear to be simple actions and to have players do them with very few points of reference.  It seems like it would be easy to draw a line between a dolphin and a mermaid but, once you try to do it while looking at the picture instead of actually drawing on the picture, it changes everything.  Thank goodness for the starfish or I wouldn't have made any points!  Great game!

I feel bad rating this so high but it is criminally underrated so I don't feel that bad. Same review as loony quest (which is a slightly better implementation):

Definitely underrated but also such a different style of game it is bound to turn off some people. I think just about every game "collection" should have one of the quests but I do understand it's not a slam dunk winner for everyone. Still, such a good game to introduce people to the hobby and get them into something without "teams" which most party games use. Teams are great, but the limitation removes the majority of strategy games from consideration.

Such a creative and fun drawing mechanic. Whenever you play a game like this, you wonder why no one had ever thought of it before. This plays quickly, is easy to explain, engages all ages, and is challenging. What more could you ask for?

I just tried the 18 easy cards, but it really is easy. There is not much for adults yet. For kids only , this is ok, but the fun factor isn't very high. Good for building spacial visualisation . Hard cards are a little bit better.
The replayability is very low. Seems to me I won't be willing to revisit the cards often. I'll give a try to Loony quest to see if it's better (I surely hope so)

In the line-drawing game Doodle Quest, players study challenging quest cards, then try to replicate the depicted path(s) on their separate transparent doodle sheets. Once finished, the players place their doodle sheets on top of the quest card to see whether the drawings line up. Visit starfish for bonus points! Doodle Quest includes 36 illustrations with two different levels of play: beginning and advanced.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

While this is definitely a kid's game, there is place for this in an adult's collection to be pulled out and played once in a while. Always hilarious to see the reveal of everyone's drawing attempts. Replay value is likely low - as in, I wouldn't want to play again and again but its fun here and there.

A great game, though one you don't have to keep the score while playing. My kids enjoy it a lot, and I've played without the kids too and it's fun. 

Hard to find a game where the playing field is even when playing with kids, but something like this really works well in that regard.

I enjoy that all the different quests have the same theme, and it lends itself to other themes to be used for expansions down the road.

The markers do dry out pretty fast, putting the tips back on in a timely manner is a problem for families with young kids, I would presume.

I play this game alot with my girls.  I don't understand the low rating from other users.  This game is REALLY fun.

Each player gets a marker, a transparancy, an eraser and a fish stencil.

The idea is to follow the directions on 6 of the 36 boards that come with the game.  This will involve drawing a line through an obstacle course or circling certain things on the board or drawing fish in certain locations.

Then, after each player finishes their drawing, they place the transparancy on the board and see how well they did, getting points based on how well they did.

There is alot of replayability.  The underwater theme is nice, but I really want Looney Quest. 65 bucks vs. 18.  I think I'll keep this one.

DQ was a hit with everyone who played it, from kids to in-laws to grown-up gamers. The simplicity of estimating a drawing was at exactly the right level and difficulty can be adjusted by either using the flip side of the quests or ensuring better players sit askew from the quest board. Simple good fun: would have been nice to play up to 6 or even 8, though.

A very simple basic premise: there's a card in the center of the table showing some kind of quest that everyone must complete: protect 5 divers from three sharks, draw eyes on the sea creatures, make a zig-zagging path through some obstacles to lead a fish out of danger, and so on. The rub is that you're completing these quests by drawing lines on a clear dry-erase board where you're having to guess at the positions of the obstacles you're trying to avoid. It's clever and works well as a kids' game, as well as a silly adult game, and works especially well as an adult game after a few glasses of wine. Good stuff here.

Hm, should be easy enough to make your own boards...

Great for kids, decent for adults.  

For kids I think this is fantastic and is who the game was made for.  It has a good level of challenge for a younger audience.

For adults, most of the scenarios you will find to be fairly simple.  Especially if you are playing with people with good spatial visualization.

I still don't know how much replay value the games has.  I imagine it would be better for kids.  It is something that I will bring out for a short time for some laughs.  The biggest downside is that it only allows for 4 players.

RATING: 6.5
1 play, 2er

Clever idea: everyone looks at a drawing, then draws on their transparency according to the rules specified on the card (e.g., touch this but not that). Then overlay the transparency and see what you got right: score VP accordingly. After 6 rounds, most VP wins.

Fun, but a bit too easy. Not that I'm perfect, but it seems like it should be harder on the hard side! There should be some time pressure.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Maybe some day I'll have kids and be able to appreciate kids games, especially ones adults can get some kind of challenge or entertainment out of, but for now I do not have kids and just don't want to spend my time on games this light and juvenile.

The idea here is clever.  There is a picture in the center of the table and each player has a transparency and dry-erase marker.  Each picture also has a goal such as draw a line through or circle some number of objects.  Each player is drawing on their transparency trying to best accomplish this goal.  When finished the transparency is placed over the picture and points are scored.

I can see the value in this for families because adults and children alike are on a level playing field.  A child can have just as good if not better spacial perception as any adult.  It just didn't engage me and when I played it was with a group of adults so there is no reason we can't play something more engaging.

Perfectly charming, but I suspect this has about 5 plays (or about 75 minutes) of entertainment in it before it'll burn out.

Loony Quest which is more complex and has more boards looks more interesting.

I feel as though I'm being unnecessarily harsh on Doodle Quest; it was quite fun. It's just limited fun.

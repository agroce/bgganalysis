new - this is the C3i #28 printing of the game - chits still attached new to counter sheet - maps/paperwork all in new unused condition

Comes with the C3i Magazine #28 - also new and unread - a whole bunch of extra paper work and chits included for the games: Andean Abyss, Unconditional Surrender - WWII in Europe Variant, The Dark Valley, No Retreat #2, First Battle of Mantinea (HOPLITE), Panzer, 1914 the Battle for Liege, Combat Commander, For the People and more!)  

I only wanted the Iron and Oak extra ships from this issue (so they are not present)

RATING: 8.5
A great game for an evening, and a fantastic introduction to the Unconditional Surrender! system (it made me rush out and buy the full game). Gives just enough detail to tell the Case Blue/Operation Uranus story without too much that it slows down the game to a crawl.

A very clean and tight scenario. Some tough decisions, without a great rules overhead. Very enjoyable.

Good as an introduction to USE's basic rules.
As a stand alone game... too small, too few units. It's pretty good, but not awesome.

So much impressed that I ordered the big game hours after playing it.

The 8.8 counts for the mechanics of the USE monster game, although this gamette from the magazine is a very good introduction, its balance is quite bad really.

Unless the Russian player acts like a real noob, there is very little chance he will loose according to the original victory conditions.

I would go for 2 Supply cities to win for the Germans, then it is a real challenge. So mostly if Stalingrad OR Grozny would fall .... the Germans would win.

Very interesting design with some new systems. Especially integration of cost of operations with the production system. More interested in the full product (USCB is more a 'competitive gamers' game than I generally like) - but this shows some serious promise.

2014-08-29 - Finished a solitaire game yesterday.  Putting down some notes for casual readers, as well as something to come back to if I write a review and/or if I play again.

First, it seems like a great intro game to the Unconditional Surrender operational sequences.  I really like the rules layout and found it pretty easy to look up answers to my questions.  I also like that the portions of the rules that are in US:E are left in the rules for this game . . . you get to see what you are missing out on.  I had *zero* rules questions - they were worded in such a way that I needn't go pestering geeks about phraseology.  I liked that a lot.

Second, my play of the game was solitaire, and ended in a draw.  I think that in any play of the game it will be rather difficult for the Germans to acquire 3 cities for a victory, and I think they have nearly ZERO chance to acquire 4.  But we will see, since I intend to play it again.  The Russians seem to have a much better chance of a victory (3 factories) or an auto-victory (all four), but auto-victory probably wouldn't come if at all until the late-game, I suspect.

Third, I (predictably) made a lot of tactical/maneuver errors in my game, and I expect to return to the game to see if I can do any better in that regard.  I found the "cutting off of supply" mechanics a bit wonky . . . it is very difficult to cut an enemy's supply chain while staying in supply one's self.  

The Germans + Allies have so few counters, it takes pretty much all of them to cover their front, let alone go joy-riding behind enemy lines.  To do so, they almost necessarily will have their own supplies cut in turn since they pretty much have to open a hole in their lines in order to cut enemy supplies.  Since the Russians have more units, and they are more easily replaced, and they have more production, and the front is usually closer to their deployment areas, it is far more likely that the Russians will be able to successfully pocket the Germans, rather than vice-versa.  At least in my experience so far.

Also - the supply /deployment zones were a bit wonky, to me . . . the German attack sort of *has* to stop at Voronezh in the north, then run diagonally along the Don to Stalingrad.  If they pass Voronezh, then the Russians are allowed to deploy behind the German lines.  I get the thematic point: the Russian front to the north was still present and it wouldn't be too difficult to send some units in from that direction.  But for the game, it makes the Germans have to create this huge salient, which with their limited number of counters can create problems.

Fourth, the weather was a bit rough in the game.  I rolled Severe weather quite a bit, which eliminates the tactical advantage the Germans have with their tanks.

Fifth, Russian air power in this game seems like it could easily overwhelm the Axis.  With higher production and two air commands, the Russians can really put a wallop on the Germans . . . but I'll test out this theory more in the next game.

Thanks Mr. Vasta for this little gem.  I will probably use it as a training game if I find an opponent for USE.

A fine intro to Unconditional Surrender but does not provide any freedom of approach to the subject it tackles. You have to do certain things and have to do them good with the help of luck; a puzzle to be solved if you will. Thus it is good to learn the mechanics of its wonderful parent game but not a very good game on its own in my opinion.

C3I #28, March 2015.  Read through the rules, and found the system to be very intriguing. Played through a couple of times, and while I am not a big east front fan, I did see the promise this game holds for strategic play excellence. So I pre-ordered its Daddy USE.

I ordered this edition of c3i (#28) for the 1914: Offensive a Outrance Liege expansion.  This was a throw-in (albeit on an interesting topic).

It plays very cleanly.  Good little magazine game.

I suspect it scales well to the theatre-wide game of which this is a small part.

I love this combat system that doesn't use combat factors on individual units. This one seems to be difficult for the Axis player, which seems historical. I haven't tried it with the designer's suggestion of 9 production points for the Germans instead of 8. I look forward to playing this one again. I know USE is a bit of a monster game, but I think I will buy it whenever it comes out with the second edition.

Very good ruleset, clear and with nice twists like pay production to move and no values printed on the chits; chit scale makes it hard to keep urban areas; also I miss the diplomatic part (but it's pretty obvious why it's been cut). A nice intro to a nice, modern and simple system.

Been loving this. Right there exactly in my current gaming sweet-spot. Small map, low counter density. A fantastic, tight, well thought out ruleset. Plenty of choices. Very few exceptions.

Solo it plays beautifully, a real puzzle for the Germans. Feels like it's going to stay fun for many spins to come. Think I may actually be able to get rid of it's big brother, which I'm slowly having to admit may be be just a bit much for my puny little brain to be excited to handle.

Glad that this little guy exists cuz the system really is a beaut'.

I really like what this demonstrates of the full game, which seems to be a compelling distillation of WiF & suchlike forebears. Maybe replacements snap back into play too easily? but generally, how this simplifies and abstracts more complicated systems without losing much depth seems very appealing.

Even with low counter density, this game has meat. Since you have to pay for unit activation, repair and rebuild, there are interesting decisions to make. Supply is tricky to maintain as enemy ZOC can block it as Axis will stretch quite a bit. And where to put those few mechanized units, that is a question... Air combat is absolutely fantastic, with anti-air combat preceding ground support. Really like the sorties system. Taking russian factories to lower production points really add sense of urgency to Axis. I am really glad I build this pnp, and will play it for sure.

The Unconditional Surrender! game engine is almost like it's designed for my exact preferred specifications (game scale, low counter density, etc). It's pretty much the first hex and counter engine I really love (apart from BattleTech, if that one counts). I'm deducting one point from my rating for lack of balance (it's super difficult for the Germans), even though it's supposed to be a kind of training game for the full scale version.

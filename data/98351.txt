First impressions: super quality cards, great illustrations and accessible layout, and an Agricola size box for a game that would fit in a Jaipur/Citadels box.

After 1st play: This is a game to engage with! It deserves time. It's fun, thematic and complex and will most likely be more fun the more it's played.

Looking forward to playing this many more times!

[thing=98351]Core Worlds[/thing]: 2-5 players (~90min with 3).

[thing=98351]Core Worlds[/thing] has deck building, resource management (actions, energy, cards), and anticipating your opponents. CW combines the theme with the game mechanisms perfectly. You draft cards into your deck from a common pool, but it takes actions and energy (generated by your worlds), which you also need to deploy troops into your warzone before they can attack and conquer new worlds. So, there is planning and preparation involved, which to me feels very thematic. You don't know exactly which worlds and units come up each round (except in the last round), so you have to be flexible.

There's a sense of progression, because you have 5 separate decks for the 10 rounds of the game. Generally you can afford the cards that become available unlike in some other deckbuilding games. The cards are mainly unique. If you play with 2 or 3 players, it takes a few games to see all of them.

You never have quite enough resources to do everything that you'd like, you have choices to make, and there is no clear best choice (except maybe the final rounds). The last worlds you reach are the Core Worlds that give the most bonus points, but you should not depend solely on those.

Each starting deck has a unique Hero, with their own special effect. The starting decks are also made more varied by a pre-game draft in which you replace one ground and one fleet unit with cards from a common pool.

You always have a different game. There is no direct conflict between players, but due to the common pool you have to keep an eye on what the other players are likely to do, and be faster than them.

The expansion [thing=125099]Galactic Orders[/thing] adds a 6th starting deck with another hero, more units, worlds, tactic cards, and events that help you in the early game and hinder you in the later stages. You also get ways to work around your energy and action limitations and you cycle through the cards in your deck faster. It makes a great game even better (but a little longer, around 120min with 3 players).

You can start playing the game without emphasizing the deck building aspect, and start to search for synergies and trim your deck more when you learn the game.

A second expansion [thing=156867]Revolution[/thing] adds more story through Heroic Tactics for both the starting heroes and the heroes who you might draft during the game. You also get more Advancements (Galactic Orders comes with only one) with various special effects.

This title suffers from some serious analysis paralysis tendencies. Even without meaning to do so, I feel a bit too absorbed in performing strength comparisons with two degrees of freedom (and with the need to plan ahead) that in THIS CASE the game became more a chore -- and I am a meaty game fan too.

This isn't to say this isn't a good game, but just that it wasn't as much fun as I am accustomed to, is all.

This title could easily have been produced in a MUCH smaller box without compromising quality or theft prevention.

The expansion makes the game in this instance.  Turns a good game into an excellent one due to the addition of the factions.  Factions allow for direct competition between the players.  It also allows players to build a strategy with repeated use of a similar faction.

I quite liked Core Worlds. It certainly is thematically superior to any other deck builder I have played and personally I like it better than Race for the Galaxy. It plays smoothly, but too long with 5 players for sure (to be fair, the rulebook warns only experienced players to play with 5). I like the management of energy and actions and the way your deck builds with nearly unique cards. Not all cards come into play which bodes well for replayability. I might pick this one up yet. One take back is the terrible card design for cost vs. drafting cost vs. generating energy - very confusing and curious that it was not solved. Still, like this one.

Love the artwork. Gameplay didn't set well. Will give it another try in the future. - After 2nd play, still didn't do it for me. Maybe played straight by the rules would be better.

This is one I tried multiple times to get to my gaming group table but they were just not interested...so i've had to play it solo, which is itself a variant. Of course, I couldn't just play it straight solo. The fact that every turn you move from one sector to the next, buying cards that you may or may not see again as you rush towards the end didn't set well. Games that force me to move faster than I want bug me. So I tried a couple of play variants to extend the time in each sector...and neither went well. I'm not ready to write the game off totally as I really need to sit down with a group and play it properly, but so far it has left me cold. I love the artwork and I think there is a good game in there, but if it's for me I really don't know yet.

RATING: 6.5
Core Worlds is a deck builder with a sci fi theme where you play one of several factions slowly conquering their way into the core worlds of a decaying galactic empire. So, you are space Vikings trying to carve out your space fiefdom from a dead space Rome. You start with simple ground and air forces and over the course of several rounds you unlock new decks you flop and recruit ever more powerful units and planets from in order to make your end run in the final rounds of the game at specific core worlds. The game is slightly less thematically generic than Dominion because it tells a story, sort of like Thunderstone but with less opaque mechanics, and the factions each have a slight variance in play style that only grows with the expansion. Core Worlds affords you a certain level of focus in your play as well because it takes specific strategies that you must build your deck towards throughout the course of the game if you wish to obtain them. This can back fire if you end up in the wrong part of the turn and someone else takes that world from you. This means you have to build into your deck the ability to take a few target worlds to be safe. In general, I like this game and wish I could get it to the table more often but deck builders are a tough sell at my usual game night.

RATING: 6
The critical problem is distribution of VP, and this concerns the cards, player order and the stages of the game. The "prestige" cards appear near-meaningless faced by this, and it also allows prediction of winners and losers sometime before the end.

Its a step up from Ascension, and it works better as a multiplayer, but there's that ever-so-common feeling of roughness in the design that you just didn't get back in the 1970s when games were done by professionals in offices, rather than amateurs in cottages.

***

Mar 12: Played again, and this time gave 5/10 because attacks strengths always seemed too great for available cards & actions. Promised synergies therefore never materialised. The game may have turned on the opportunity to get a particular card at the end [as mentioned previously]. This suggests there's only one good way to play the game. We played slowly, with a lot of effort on the part of some, but it seems their thinking time was largely wasted.

Seems fairly unique among deck-builders.  It's a little complex, perhaps a little long, and you don't seem to cycle your deck enough to make the deck-building worthwhile.  Other than that, I think it's one of the more well-designed games of its kind.  Don't know if I'll pick it up right away, as games like these require a level of dedication to practice, in order to get more fun out of them.

A deck builder that pushes rather nicely on the Dominion paradigm.  I like the initial drafting as it helps mix up the start in a good manner.  The largest negative for me is the end game.  Core worlds (in the game) are so critical that you can be a little hosed by others snapping them up before you can.  Turn order is surprisingly important and yet entirely arbitrary.

I will note that the expansion nicely improves on the base game and helps by providing alternate routes/options.  I wouldn't say it entirely alleviates my issues with the base game, but it does help mitigate them to some extent.

RATING: 7
I played this game only three times, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

Deck building is not really a genre I gravitate towards, even though big box card games are my favorite style of game. So, when I approached Core Worlds, I wasn't very excited.

Yet, I enjoyed Core Worlds much more than I though I would. For one thing, the game is very thematic. Everything you do in the game makes thematic sense: You use the wealth from the planets you control to recruit more units to then conquer more planets. This engine building aspect is definitively one of my favorite elements of the game... right after the combo building aspect. Finding the best synergies between cards is one of the things I love the most about games and this game, being a deck builder, has plenty of combos to explore.

However, some design choices are a bit weird for me and they unfortunately reduce my enjoyment of this title. First of all, as a minor complaint, I don't really like how the game looks. The artwork is actually very good. What I have a problem with is the card graphic design... something about it seems unpolished and bland to me. Not a big deal, but worth mentioning it. My second and more serious criticism is that the game is a bit too long for what it is. It's far lighter than it looks and I'm not sure that 2 hours is a justified length.

The third and last of this list of negative aspect is also the most important: I really dislike how the card market works. You draw randomly a certain number of cards and there's no guarantee you'll get what you want. Sure, since you play so many rounds, it's highly unlikely that you won't get the cards you need at all... and I guess that this system increases re-playability, because you don't see every card every game. Yet this random market system is in the way of the very thing I enjoy the most about the game: making synergies. It can be quite frustrating, when you're focusing on a specific type of card and you don't get any for a whole turn. If there's one thing I've learned from Game Tech is that designers should allow players to do the things they like about the game more and not less... Core Worlds breaks this "rule" for me.

That's why I consider Core Worlds a very good game, that I will gladly play on a semi-regular basis... but it's not one that I would consider including in my collection. If only the game was a bit shorter and had a slightly more elegant mechanism for the card market, this could have been a game that I would really love. It's still great, but I'm just a bit sour for the missed opportunity.

RATING: 8
For some, Core Worlds boils down to a pure arithmetic game of insane number crunching every turn, trying to maximize your output to be competitive.

That's really somewhat a good descriptor of the game. Unlike most deckbuilders, you can't just turn off all the possibilities in your head and focus on getting the best thing for you right now, using this hand, then repeat that every turn and hope you win because you had better "rules of thumb" and better luck than your opponent. This game requires:
-Better rules of thumb
-Somewhat better luck
-Much better ability to see how actions and economy will chain both this turn and way later down the road
-Ability to discern what card types are good and when.

Core Worlds isn't like other deckbuilders in that there are 4 distinct power tiers of cards that you can buy (ignoring Sector V - The Core Worlds, as this ends the game). You only get TWO turns per power tier to try and make the best of it. This creates one upside and one downside:
-The upside: You need to be highly discerning as to what you really need and what will truly help you in the coming phases.
-The downside: You don't get enough time to do much more than gobble up new planets. Unless you have the most insane planet-attacking engine by about the end of Sector II, you will not be able to draft many non-planet cards usually until Sector IV-Luxury Worlds. This kind of defeats the whole purpose of using them to further your goals, and they tend to just be for last-minute Core World grabs later in the game.

Sector V - Core Worlds should definitely have had a rule where every single card comes out on the first turn. Without this rule, players who were building toward specific worlds all game will have to just sit and do absolutely nothing. They have the rule for the final turn of the game, but not everyone can grab all their goal worlds on the same turn in the same deck.

Another flaw is that the player who starts with the Destiny Marker (first player token) has an insane advantage where they get first pick of EVERY new Sector in a 2 Player game. We've only played this with 2-Player, so it gets quite annoying seeing the new best stuff and being powerless to grab it unless the Destiny player flubs their preparation.

However, despite the first player advantage, final turn rule, and insanely high arithmetic near the end of the game, Core Worlds really is a great game with an excellent sense of pacing. Because those sectors just keep coming and going at breakneck speeds, you really get the sense that you're building toward something, unlike Star Realms or other deckbuilders where you just sort of meander around for a while, hoping the random trade conveyor gives you better cards than your opponent.

Both your deck and the game itself have a clear pace to them and it feels very satisfying. Like you really left the Barbarian Worlds to move into the heart of a galaxy and take over, establishing a new empire.

Update: After several more plays, my score doesn't change but one addition criticism: No scoring mechanic. In a game with scores that can reach excess of 70 points when you get better, it strikes me as odd that this game is just winner-take-all. That means you have no idea if you're improving from game to game unless you specifically write it down. Having a system similar to Roll Player where there are tiers of achievement (maybe 90+ points is "True Galactic Empire", 70-89 is "Galactic Superpower", and so on) would lend a bit of good feeling to players who tried hard but technically lost by like 1 point. After several games where players lost by 1-2 points, this felt like a completely necessary part of the rulebook. We've houseruled this to keep it fun.

It's an interesting engine-building deck builder doing something different than the other big titles out there. I like the theme and tableau building. But honestly, after a few plays it just feels very dry and the spark has quickly faded for me. Your decisions can also seem quite driven by the pacing (what can I conquer and when) with only a little meaningful input by a decent player. It's a decent design, but not as great as I thought at first.

Core Worlds is a deck building game like Dominion. Like Dominion there are card combos to experiment with and there are junk cards that you just want to get out of your deck.  It offers a quick way of shortening your deck, simply by deploying rubbish units to your tableau and leaving them there.  There are, of course, cost and timing issues attached to this.  Hand management is critical.

Core Worlds is also a tableau building game like Race for the Galaxy.  Except that where Race has several viable strategies, Core Worlds just has the military conquest one.  Despite that conquest theme, player interaction is negligible.  We're friendly competitors and I would never turn my military might on you, even if you did steal that critical planet from under my nose.  

Core Worlds is turn-based and has plenty of cards with plenty of text to read.  With five even moderately thoughtful players, the downtime can be quite painful.  I probably wouldn't play again with more than four.

Something that Core Worlds does better than Race for the Galaxy is offer a sense of progress, even a basic  narrative.  This is achieved by the simple mechanic of introducing more powerful and expensive cards turn by turn and through those core worlds that appear at the end and really do feel like ultimate objectives.

I wonder about this game's replay value.  There is just that one conquer planets strategy and there are but three resources; energy, fleet strength and ground strength.  There aren't too many variations to be played with these things.  The most interesting questions are around prioritization; do I upgrade my military or take another planet, will a friendly competitor take what I want if I don't grab it now?

Production quality is pretty good, the artwork struck me as uninspired.  Everything rattles around in an outsized box.

Possibly the best deck building game I played so far. I love the sci-fi theme. The artwork is great but I think that the card layout could have been designed better. The rules are simple enough and the gameplay seems quite deep. I really like that the cards are separated in different decks so that the players gain slowly access to better cards and planets. There is not a lot of player interaction but turn order really matters. All in all a very promising game.

Limited rounds, the warzone of card deployment, the various synergistic strategies, and ability to both make long-term strategic decisions and short term choices about invasions and drafting mallow this game to truly become a narrative of the collapse of the empire. I really feel like I'm guiding the events that led to Asimov's Foundation series. The art hits the perfect Homeworld vibe, a space atmosphere that's usually quite unexplored in games.

Core Worlds is an interesting game. I played once over a year ago, but had a chance to play it twice recently, once with the Galactic Orders expansion.

While I don't hate it, I find several problems with it. The strict 10 turn limit means you will never cycle though your deck like you would in other deck-builders, and highly rewards thinning you deck as much as possible. So I just don't get that engine-building feel that would like a deck-builder to give me.

I also chafe under the action/energy restrictions. With those two restrictions, you have plan your actions very carefully depending on what cards come out during the empire phase. I would have preferred a game about would-be galactic conquerors was more free-flowing, but I concede that's a thematic issue you can just disagree on. More importantly, it's hard to change course once someone take a card before you. I find that it's hard to develop a good strategy with card synergies as your just taking the cards that will help

That leads me to my third complaint. The aforementioned Core Worlds are the game's 6-cost, bonus point scoring cards. I feel like it again too easy for those cards to snatched away by turn order or a fortunate/unfortunate draw of the deck by your opponents or yourself, respectively.

Having said that, I really did like the improvements the expansion brought. It made the deck thinning and cycling easier, which is appreciated. The aforementioned Galactic Orders bring a new dimension to the game, increasing the values of some cards and forcing players to choose between calling in those 'favors' now, or scoring the area control points at the end.

Deck building..great, one of my favorite mechanisms. Space..awesome! This game is greatly themed and gives the deck-building genre a tactical,thinky (mathematical some would say and they are partly right) aspect for the first time. After a game, your brain will probably be exhausted from the choices, options and numbers floating around. A few flimsy moving parts that might prove to be a nuisance, but looking past it, an overall solid game for players that like deck-building and appreciate a challenge. I suggest 3-4 players as 2 is too few while with 5, available cards disappear in a glimpse from one turn to the next.

Not yet rated as I've only tried it solo to learn the rules - it's one that I really want to like, but I've a feeling that there's going to be too much AP involved in working out exactly how to maximise energy/actions each round - the expansion may fix this - or it may just add to it! - but certainly appears to open up the play somewhat with the additional bonuses you can get - I feel it would be a great game if played regularly and without too much AP, but whether that is possible in practice is yet to be seen...

I feel the game starts off greatly, but then as we closed in on the end I kind of lost track or lost the feeling of control over my deck. I struggled over some vp balances, and some of the later cards seem pointless since they would not yield many times over their ability. I'd like a bit more control over my deck. Perhaps 2 decks per player wouldn't be a bad idea in this game. Overall a great deck building game.

meta-comment: I had the feeling of losing control towards the end also in another Andrew Parks game, Parthenon.

Core Worlds is a space themed tableau game, in a world where there is already Race for the Galaxy... What has it to offer?
Well, there's one more element: deckbuilding! (Although, Eminent Domain appeared on the market just before Core Worlds!).
The game structure is interesting enough to be worth exploring, with the everchanging draftable cards.
I fear the designer was a little too shy with the card powers: the worlds are not so varied, and troops and tactics look rather similar, so there's very little room for combos and such...
One thing that bothers me a little is the setup: I find it quite annoying, with the necessity to separate the various piles of cards.
Another annoying thing is the graphic design of the cards: the (quite beautiful) artwork disappears inside the cards layout, and overall the cards are not so "readable" from distance. A textless, icon-centered design similar to RftG would've been a better choice...
Even with these potential flaws, the game feels like it is interesting in potential, and I definitely want to explore it to see if my initial feelings are right (I hope not).
Tentative initial rating is a 6.

Initial Impression: How did they manage to make a card game so thematic? This game is amazing in the way it tells a story. There's a definite sense of progression throughout the game which really feels as if your Empire is growing and strengthening as the Galactic Empire crumbles around you. The game feels a bit longer than other cardgames but the overall experience is well worth it.

If you seek the best deckbulding game, then go with 'Dominion'. But as a game using deckbuilding mechanics, 'Core Worlds' easily comes in as second place (beating Thunderstorm, Ascension and Eminent Domain). You are not building a deck engine with combos in this game (most of the time you simply try to get the most valuable card) but there is enough planning necessary to make this a satisfying experience.

Love this!!! A very "thinky" deck builder. You have to manage both attack strengths to get the right planets, as well as your limited supply of Energy each round not only to buy cards but to play them as well. We played 2 player, Brian and I. I pulled it out 27-19. Expansions will be played soon! I think Flo will enjoy this one as well.

After 3 plays, I still feel like I dont have enough experience to fully disclose my opinion. But so far the game is very fun, and has a bit of a euro feel to it by way of having to plan how you will do a turn. You dont have workers, but it almost feels like you do.

The event system feels a bit fiddly and artificially added on, It is thematic and the art on the cards is as nice as the rest of the game. im considering doing a play where we dont use them tho.

On a personal level, I very much wish the card boarders were black instead of white, I think that would have accentuated the art better.

RATING: 3
I'm not sure there is much of a point to this. Calling a deck building game is a stretch. You acquire cards over 10 turns, but there isn't much of a chance to use the cards you acquire because of the large starting hands and the minimal number of cards played on a turn. In a two-player game, you also only see a small fraction of the cards in the game which means tuning a deck is impossible to do.

There are a lot of nice things about how the game is played, but they just don't mesh into a good or compelling game. I was ready for the game to end half-way through the game because the short fallings were so obvious once a couple of turns passed.

AFTER 1 PLAY:

I had such high hopes for this game - it looked set to combine the fluidity of a deckbuilder with the permanence of a CCG/tableau builder. In fact, as Eminent Domain got more buzz, I felt like I should have bought this instead of EmDo.

After one play, my mind has completely changed - I vastly prefer EmDo. Why?

- This game is a lot like Thunderstone in Space - Thunderstone has a series of currencies that you juggle to take what you need to - light, strength, power, VP. So too does Core Worlds. The problem here is that the whole game becomes mathy and in a really linear fashion - you only have so many actions, so much energy, so many rounds, so much ground/fleet strength - you CONSTANTLY feel like you need more of all of them, and it just chafes - the game limits you constantly and constantly feels like it's getting in your way. There's no wy, for example, to get more actions, yet so often you seem to run out of actions and have loads of energy left, and deploying troops is impossibly action-heavy, with no discount for deploying many at once. Efficient play might mean loads of meaningful decisions, but I personally prefer open-ended gameplay.

- This is especially pronounced in the round limit. The game took 2.5 hours but still felt like it was over too soon (the irritating mathiness meant severe AP for a first play). Why is there an artificially-paced 10-round limit? I want to game to go on until you hit the core worlds - it's not like the card pool isn't self-clearing. I'd also like to see more choice - double the number of players as a base number of worlds, rather than one per player. Why you need to be limited to two rounds per deck is a little beyond me. The round limit just becomes another restrictive currency in a game already hamstrung by restrictive currencies.

- There was, in a four-player game at least, severe lockout - I finished with no core worlds because in both rounds someone took the only one I could take before I could get it. Surprise, surprise, I lost. As much as this can be seen as a problem of not knowing the decks and not building my deck properly, it was also really frustrating to have the only core world I could get be taken by a player who could have taken either one. 

- The starting decks are too large and the sole mechanic for clearing them out is incapable of clearing them out fast enough. They will still clog your hand unless you've deployed them an not used them (at considerable action cost early int he game - still, probably worth trying in game 2).

- There's limited card draw and no real deck customisation through clearing out crap - especially since (like ascension) often someone will snake your move before your turn, so you're often left needing to buy something (since otherwise you waste a valuable action) but having nothing that really makes your deck pop. Part of the problem seems to be that the pre-scripted strategies (heroes, robots, vehicles, star cruisers, starfighters, infantry) don't feel enough on their own so you'll inevitably be competing. This is especially annoying due to the tactics cards which clog your deck up no end and yet can never be removed.

- The game terms are confusing - there are rounds, phases, turns and actions - all meaning different sections of time, apart from the last one which means logistical ability. There's also empires and warzones - terminology with specific game meanings that could be (and were) easily confused by new players. The maths make this less theme-heavy than I'd like, as does the lack of huge space armadas because you really don't get to draft much - why couldn't you just say 'tableau' and 'deck'?

- The graphic design is also woeful - all cards have the same four symbols - energy, VP, ground and fleet strength, but on the planets the fleet and ground strength are costs, while the energy is a production value, On the units, that is reversed, yet the symbols are identical. We never had a problem in gameplay, but it  would make the game near incomprehensible to new players or observers. While I understand the reasoning behind making the borders white, the blocky, amateurish borders look dreadful in comparison to EmDo and RftG - and while the former is quite pretty, the latter is functional at best. The worst thing is tha the Core Worlds at is gorgeous - but it's completely drowned out by the anaemic colour palette and blocky design.

I am not rushing to play this again, although I'd like to play some more to confirm or remove my suspicions - regardless, it was a real letdown.

I’m intrigued by the gameplay of this heavier tableau/deck builder. However, the long unwieldy play time turns me off a bit. I like the idea of a complex engine builder that is hard to manage, but the reported 3-4 hour playtimes for 2 players means that this one would rarely hit the table. I would pick up in a trade for cheap, but it isn’t anything I’m too excited about buying.

Liked this more than I was expecting too - although I'd never ever play it with 5 again (that's probably 2 too many).

Graphic design is a bit suspect - worlds generate energy, ships/troops etc cost energy so the same icon is used, leading to confusion when you look at your 'tableau' (to use Race for the galaxy speak).

All in all, quite like it - but it seems very dependant on grabbing the vp worlds at the end, but that might be 5 players ...

** Update, certainly better with 2 than 5. Need to try it with 3 or 4 ...

I should play this game more. I've played mostly two player games, which work fairly well, but I get the feeling it might open up a bit more with three or four. The building power level requires more setup time, but that is probably worth the effort. I'm not sure how much I like the final rounds, though: too much can hinge on hitting exact thresholds of power. This is mitigated by showing the thresholds on the play aids, but it's still a little weird.

RATING: 7
Core Worlds feels like a game that ought to be more than it is.  The premise sounds great, and the cards are fantastic.  The problem I have with it is that it plays too slowly - you buy only 1-2 cards per round (and that's only if you count conquering worlds as "buying"), and trash cards only when you conquer worlds.  My deck gets better over the course of the game, but not a lot better.  I can do more at the end, but not a lot more.  It's underwhelming.  Even the few shiny toys that I do manage to add to my deck I only get to use once or twice.

The play is also kind of cumbersome.  I like the Warzone in theory - playing your cards out to the table and then having to decide how to use them is clever and adds an extra layer of decisions, especially for those cards that give bonuses when they're out.  Except that the bonuses are never worth not conquering a planet.  

However, with all that said, my 7 year old loves this game.  And I love playing it with him.  His enthusiasm for each new toy unveiled for purchase is infectious, and it is exactly the right level of complexity for him.

Juego de construcción de mazo, estilo dominion, pero con mas chicha. Es sobre invasión de planetas. Se juega en diez turnos y hay que ir gastando energia para jugar unidades que te permitan hacer invasiones. De momento, sólo lo he jugado una vez, con la expansión de las ordenes galácticas. Sin esa expansión probablemente el juego se quede un poco corto.
Es largo, para dos o tres jugadores, aunque con la expansión llega a seis, pero jugarlo a seis debe ser un infierno.

Takes a lot of time for what it accomplishes. Star Realms is a vastly more efficient space-based deckbuilder, but Core Worlds lacks direct conflict and instead relies on an escalating narrative. Its story is a "Homeworld"-y spin on the Anabasis of Xenophon/fall of an empire. Just somehow manages to make the game really slow, especially with a lot of players. A simultaneous blind-bid/draft would have made this so much cleaner.

The cards are well made, but I think this game seems unfinished. First game was well balanced 25-22. Second game was a blow out, as we both knew which cards were best and the turn order pendulum was most important. I suspect this game will never emerge from the box for game three. 

We are not doing too well with some recent purchases. I think I need to wait until after the hype dies down. Eminent domain was a similar bust.

A very good, quick-moving, surprisingly thinky deck builder, with a lot of interesting decisions and the added bonus of having long-term goals. Hand management is actually possible since you can hold onto a card every turn, and discarding can get you additional energy. 

With that said, the game can actually get very mathy, as you calculate how much energy you'll need, how many fleets and ground forces you'll need, which cards you will be able to discard, etc. Add in the timing elements--taking a card with an energy tokens, taking a core world before a prestige card, not to mention the innumerable turn order considerations–-and whew! This can be quite a brain burner. It goes by fast, though, which is a nice blend.

There is a good game here.  Deck building combined with action points.  However, keeping track of everyone's energy and actions is a little too fiddly.

Like another of my favorite deckbuilders, Nightfall, Core Worlds doesn't seem to get as much play as it should. I think part of this is that it's more or less a fixed-fun game that is probably best with 3, and you probably don't want to play with 5. But since good 5-player games are comparatively rare, and most deck-builders only support 4, Core Worlds gets brought off the shelf at times it when it probably shouldn't. The best experience here is probably with 3 actually.
---
Yeah, I like this one, with some caveats. There are AP-trap elements to it; you kinda need to work out your energy requirements at the beginning of the turn, and while it's not hard, folks who have the potential to over-analyze can kill the momentum of the game. The large number of distinct cards can also be an AP problem - unlike Ascension, there aren't nice clear thematic categories to put everything in (Lifebound, Void, Enlightened, Mechana) that simplify decision-making. Of course, the text is too small and you have to read it across the table in the drafting area, so that's not great.

Anyway, I've played a game where the pace was very slow as everyone worked everything out, and people had to be reminded that it was their turn from time to time, and it was only borderline fun. I played another game which moved at a sensible clip and it was quite entertaining. Anyway, you know what your play group is like and what their tendencies are, so you can make the call on that.

I like the random flow of card availability, similar to Ascension, as opposed to the all-up-front configuration of Dominion. I like the need to maintain balance between action and energy. I like the thematic groupings which synergize, and how it's hard and unpredictable to bring them together. I like the way you maintain both a tableau of in-play cards and a deck, and the limited ways to remove cards from the deck. I like the way the game builds, with cards that seem pretty cool early when you first draft them getting eclipsed as the game goes on. I like that the deck sizes remain sensible, where each individual decision can make a difference, but extreme deck-pruning just isn't available as an option the way it is in almost every other game of this type (even Ascension, albeit only occasionally).

At the end of the day, it shows the same edginess and lack of polish all these more complex amateur-first-time-designer, small-press-publisher games do. Doubtless a developer would have filed off a bunch of stuff, like the need to make energy decisions ahead of the turn, and probably even eliminating one of the two constraints (actions and energy; actions tend to be relevant late, energy early, and you are rarely constrained by both once you get the rhythm of the game - other constraints like hand size or available cards kick in first). The game would almost certainly be better if some of that fairly obvious stuff had been done. But even as it is, there is enough that is interesting and novel, enough that works, and enough tension in the decisions and details to the tactics, to make it a worthwhile addition to the mix for me. I actually feel like it groups more strongly with Glory To Rome/Race for the Galaxy/51st State than with other deck-builders - it feels more like an engine-building game than deck-building, and it has some of the same edgy complexity those games have also, although Core Worlds is probably simpler and cleaner-playing than the others.
---
Hard to say after just one game, but reasonably positive impressions. But, there is a lot of lookahead math - you need to figure out most of your actions for the turn before you start until you build up a decent set of heuristics, which can lead to some downtime. Also, budget enough time for the game: probably up to 2-2.5 hours for your first game with 4 (definitely take the rules advice and don't play with 5 your first time out). The game doesn't skimp on card variety, there are dozens of different types of planets and units with detailed powers, and you're going to need to digest all the variations. It'll clearly speed up significantly with familiarity, but you need to get there.

It's a nice mix of different stuff, a little bit of the card constraints of Ascension, a little bit of resource management with energy and action points, and some nice pacing. But it might be too fiddly and too long in the end for me. Look forward to trying it again, I think it has potential but it didn't immediately grab me.

It is a very good deck builder, but will not replace Dominion. On the other hand it is different enough from Dominion to not be obsolete.
The main problem I have with this game is the playing time; 1 hour is very optimistic. This is why I think this game is best with 2 or 3 players; with more players you easily have a play time of more than 2 hours, but there's not enough interaction to justify this.

A shorter o more interactive version would make an outstanding game - as it is, it is rarely played.

RATING: 9.5
A euro game disguised as a deck builder. What sets this apart from most deck builders is just how many tough choices you have to make...with a limited number of turns, and recursion being minimal you've got to be very conservative and really plan your moves out carefully.

Galactic orders lessens the burden, but also adds the entire new element of the orders to the game. Combined they're brilliant...

I've only played a handful of "deck builders" in the wake of Dominion, but Core Worlds was the first deck builder I encountered that felt sufficiently different. You draft cards, deploy cards to your tableau to build up your army/fleet, and then spend those cards to conquer "worlds," which net you more energy/currency and points.

It flows smooth, the different units are fun, and the game has big scoring planets at the end that function much like the buildings in Puerto Rico or Homesteaders. Managing that buildup to the big end-game bonuses is much of the fun. 

Some drawbacks? Core Worlds plays a little long, so I prefer this with two or three. The drawback is that you see less cards, which may unfairly handcuff you if you're trying to gather a bunch of a card type. There's some wonky rules regarding hand size and shuffling everything before the last two phases which make a ton of sense but strike me as less than perfectly "elegant." But hey, I've enjoyed every game, and I want to keep playing it after five plays.

Update: in an effort to whittle down my collection, Core Worlds finally got traded away. It's not a bad game... it's just a little long. My one issue is that certain cards (robots?) require multiples of the same type in your deck, but in a 2 or 3 player game you simply don't see enough cards to make those strategies work. 

I'll play it gladly, but I don't need to own it.

Good deck building game!  Easy to understand but hard to play well.  Back tracking calculation of energy and actions makes me so exhausted.  Need more time to play and understand the combo of cards in order to give solid comments and decide whether it is good to keep in my collection or not!
The Official "Consuls of the Empire" Variant may resolve the turn sequence impact (for 3 players) well.  The downtime may become a problem for more than 3 players!  I believe it is an awesome game for 2 players!

RATING: 8
One of my favorite deckbuilders, mechanically speaking. The use of the warzone to keep cards out of your deck until you use them to strike is really neat, in that you can both keep your deck trimmed down and prepare for a big turn by playing you draw a good hand. That mechanic and a very awesome theme make this a stellar game (no pun included).

Out of the box, Core Worlds is a more intresting, in depth game than Eminent Domain.  Core Worlds already has an expansion coming, but doesn't really need it, whereas, Eminent Domain badly needs an expansion to hopefully complete the game!

RATING: 7.2
Read the positive reviews, and I've really liked most of Stronghold Games' offerings.  Snapped this up when I saw it on Amazon for $20, and I'm glad I did.  Very good game that's easy to learn and quick to play.  There's not a lot in the over-sized box, however, even compared to other card games.  This seems to be a sort of cross between Dominion and Race for the Galaxy.  I'm interested to see what the expansion is like.

RATING: 10
Bored of Dominion? Hands too scripted? This could be the new deck-builder for you...precisely bceause it doesn't actually involve much deckbuilding. You can draft cards during the game, but you have to balance this with deploying units (which cost energy) and capturing planets (which give you VPs and more energy to work with in later turns). Oh, and you have a limited number of actions for the entire game, too.

This is a deck building action selection space empire themed game, which is so in my wheelhouse it's actually a little crazy. It's a bit of a bear to teach and is a bit less intuitive than i'd like for most players. Really nice artwork and fun theme. Gameplay is a nice balance between strategy and tactics with less of a focus on card manipulation than most deck building games, it's really more focused on action selection the deck building is core to the game play but is not the primary focus. Always play with the expansion. Core Worlds plays much better with the faction bonuses that Galactic Orders brings.

I really wanted to like this game, but it just takes too long for me to really get excited about playing it. Additionally, its pretty AP prone and never seems to play as smooth as just about any other deckbuilder. Although I acknowledge the depth, I'd rather play multiple games of just about any other respected deckbuilder than come back to this again.

Likes: It is a nice refreshing change from the deck-building genre; it's more of a strategy game that uses (at this point, beaten to death) deck-building as a mechanic rather than the focus of the game. The art and theme are great too. I am excited for expansions!

Dislikes: I'm being picky here but, the energy surge tokens should have been called something else (not same name as the card).

A really good game, prob. my fav. Deck Builder at the moment, but ONLY with the GO expansion. To me, what makes this game rise above is that it has both strategy and tactics and you are planning both against your opponent AND the final Core worlds.  Setting up to take those monster point worlds while not falling too far behind in the meantime is a real challenge.  Feels like a race.  Great game!

Dec. 2016: I just played this game again and really enjoyed it. The game feels a little long even with two players, but most of this was from being unfamiliar with the cards and needing to constantly reread them. I feel the game can become a math problem when you need to calculate how many actions you have, how many cards you can play and what you need to take over a planet. It sometimes felt overwhelming with all that was needing consideration. Played 4 times.

Played 2 2p games thus far. Last one Peter and I tied with 24 Empire Points, then tied the tiebreaker with 9 energy, and he finally edged me out on the second tiebreaker with 7 to my 6 planets.

Fun game for sure but a fair amount of things to consider. Cards come out quickly and the end game actually seems to come sooner than you expect it - all of a sudden there are cards you think you'll never afford...

Will certainly benefit from repeat play as knowing card synergy is key. There seem to be several tech trees that need a studied knowledge to take advantage of. Early on you're plotting and allocating every energy point, but after round 6 or so, there's so much variation that I have to pick one thing I'd like to do, maximize Energy as much as possible, and see if I have enough left to do something else. While perhaps not perfect play, it lets the game move and makes it more fun than trying to do huge AP calculations in my head.

Bought 2012-01

Game experience: one two-player game and a five-player game where I taught everyone how to play in both games.

I'm beginning to wonder about this game. Is it the real deal, or is it just a wolf in sheep's clothing? My first play produced the feeling that I was indeed building something powerful, that what I chose to draft and conquer made a difference. The early part of the second game had me thinking I was going to experience the same, only to be sadly disappointed by the end.

That game ended with absolutely terrible card draws in the last two rounds - brutally ugly they were: largely Galactic Grunts and Snub Fighters. Ugh. Oh yes, and don't forget about the bloody Medi Bot in the last draw - fat lot of good that'll do you in the last round. 

The bulk of my good cards were still in my deck. Frustrating. I had even taken the tact of utilizing one of those cards that lets you exchange three cards for one of your choice from your discard pile, but, wouldn't you know it, my discard pile was only two cards. Ugh.

The other nagging thing about this game, the thing that is beginning to produce a dissatisfied feeling after playing it, is that so many of the cards that you draft just barely see the light of day. One play for some of these seems woefully insufficient. You better bloody hope that some of those latter game drafts work toward a Core World that you can actually conquer, but then if you get the kind of draws that I saw tonight, well, you are screwed. Made me wish that I had thinned my deck out more than the one time, but how do you know, huh?

Core Worlds plays smoothly, but I do hope that the clunkiness that I'm starting to see is not something pervasive in future plays, otherwise this one may well be another game to leave via trade.

It's the best combination of RFTG and Dominion. You have cards that stay permanent in your area, but also doing some deckbuilding. Since the turns is limited, you won't shuffle a lot like Dominion, and your cards feels more meaningful. Also, with the sector system, the cards are progressively better, you're hardly screwed like in RFTG getting high cost card earlier, and cannot have your main purpose card later. 

And the theme is quite apparent. Interaction is mediocre, but there's some tense on some occasion. It feels like Mage Knight by preparing your deck and army, to get better things. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I need to play this more, but the theme is just great. The galactic empire is falling apart and you play the outlying "barbarians" moving in to claim the core of the empire. It is a card game though that only has limited interaction between the players, it is more about building up your forces.

Personally I would love to see a more SE4X type game with this theme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Components: Good quality cards that are easy to handle and will withstand repeated shuffling. Wonderful artwork, though the art isn't emphasized enough (too much card space is taken up by borders and text boxes). The iconography is a bit wishy washy; i.e. I always find it confusing when the same symbol is used for generating something (e.g. energy) as for consuming it, because then I have to look to some other aspect of the card to determine whether the card is adding to my total, or subtracting from it.

Thematically, even though I like sci-fi in general, I know that if this were Star Wars themed (it's very close to Star Wars already) I'd like it even more.

Experience: On the one hand, feels like a bit of a mashup between other games, like Dominion (drafting into my deck), Eminent Domain (attacking planets), and Saint Petersburg (competing over a common pool of cards, which become cheaper if overlooked). It's really not much of a deck-building game, in that there are two few cycles through my deck (fewer than five in a game). It's much more of a tight money management game, where I must carefully perform my actions in a specific, efficient sequence, in order to just barely succeed, with little waste.

At first, the game is a bit directionless. I haven't yet felt like I'm honing my deck, or specializing. But as the game progresses I do pick up steam, and am able to ramp up my military more quickly. Players end up having a huge variety of cards in their decks, to the point that I can't keep track of what my opponents are doing; rather I just plan to draft specific cards, and hope the cards will still be available when I'm ready.

This has a similar open draft to Ascension, but the implementation is, for my money, far superior.

An attempt to correct some issues in other deck building games. Unfortunately not only, it doesn't succeed but it also add some more issues of its own:

- No real sense of building your own deck. You draft from what is available from turns to turns. You recycle your deck 4 or 5 times during the game, and the more powerful units might you purchase for a high price will only be used once or twice.

- the game last ten turn, which sound good, but it makes the flow of the game too much scripted. Little choices for various strategies, you must try to follow the pace of the game and increase your units to be able to invade new worlds as there costs increase.

- The game use two ressources, Ground Forces and Fleets to capture planets. But both feel the same, as you don't know what planets will appears you can't really build a strategy.

- Very little combo possibilities and very few different effects. You merely add combat points to beat the defense value of the targeted world. Effects only give +1 or +2 combat value, or reduce the cost to play card. Only very few cards have original effects, making for a bland uninspired game

- Rather long for what it offers, especially with more than 3 players, and AP prone in the 2 last turns.

However this is not a hoax, it offers some challenges but I found it seriously overated, and can't understand the very positive reviews.

Race For The Galaxy, Dominion, Warhammer Invasion, Blue Moon are all much much better games.

Neat action point and deckbuilding game with a generic space theme. You don't cycle through your deck much. Tight competition for planets which give you points, resources and special abilities.

Biggest concern is a full 5 player game you see and have access to all of the cards but the expansions may fix that.

Very low interaction. Some tactical choices in your card play but not much for a deckbuilder.

Expansion
Adds a lot of cards to spice up the variety and some other tiles to change up how predictably everyone can do in a phase while increasing overall point totals.

Component quality was around the same as base game, which isn't stellar. That has less to do with their material choices than their production reliability.

Still very much a solitaire game.

I wanted to like Core Worlds (CW) but some of things that bother the other Deckbuilder Thunderstone can also be found here and keep CW from getting a better rating. So for a longer rant, check my comment for Thunderstone.
 
Here is the short version why I don't like Core Worlds that much: The game tends to drag. Since this is basically a multiplayer solitaire game, you have to sit through all the other turns where they are adding up numbers and thinking about all the special powers they might use or not. This wasn't that much fun. The game is just too long for what it is.

RATING: 8
Takes the 4X concept of a huge game like TI or Eclipse and mashes it with a deckbuilding mechanic that I greatly enjoy. The slow ramp of intensity toward the final core worlds is fun - you need to balance the size of your fleet and the energy you have left to purchase new troops and tactics. The final couple rounds are a test to see if you built well. 

Since everyone is competing over a small batch of cards that will shift each round, there's more player interaction than most deckbuilders. 

The only thing I don't much like are the way the cards are laid out - it's too easy to confuse the buying cost of the card versus the deployment cost. Worse, there's no visual difference between the latter and the energy gains on planets. It's thrown off me and a lot of people I've played with .

Big fan of the "Galactic Orders" expansion, though. Adds a lot of welcome options to the player's turn.

RATING: 8
A deckbuilder in which players colonize planets and use their resources to build up military strength, ultimately colonizing the final "Core Worlds" that are worth a lot of points.  The available cards change from round to round as the players travel through the galaxy, and the tableau-building of your military might feels very different from other deckbuilders.

So far, I'm really digging this game. I love the theme, the art is fantastic, and the mechanics are simple yet thinky. My wife and I aren't really fans of deckbuilding, but Core Worlds is a very light deckbuilding game, your deck isn't much bigger at the end of the game then it is at the beginning. First couple of plays took a while, and I don't think I'll ever play this with more than 3 people. There would be too much downtime.

Probably the best deck builder i've played. Unfortunately I struggle to stay interested in deck building. It builds its narrative well, as you play through the various different deck stages. THe main limitation of the game is it ends a little fast. You may not get to see those awesome cards you added to your deck in the last couple of stages. One of the main satisfactions of deck building is watching your engine churn in its completeness.

Dunno why I never rated this.  The base game of Core Worlds is pretty dry.  It has interesting ideas, but really, the game doesn't come into its own unless you add the Galactic Orders expansion.  Without it, it suffers from turn-order issues without any way of affecting the turn order itself.

A very slow and deliberately paced deck & tableau builder.  Dominion feels fast and furious compared to this one.  Your buys in Core Worlds are extremely limited and you need to know for certain that each buy will lead to its anticipated payout.  A lot of deckbuilders I've played feel like Dominion clones.  Core Worlds is not one of them.  It does its own thing but still manages to serve up that sweet deck building flavor.

Initially I wasn't hot on this game. The core game is kind of drab, as a semi deck building game. The expansion radically changes how the game plays for the better. You get a lot more flexibility in how your deck plays, how you play your cards, and the deck building aspect comes through much better. I wouldn't really recommend it without the expansion, but with the expansion, it is one of my current favorite games.

Played once. A good deckbuilder, and I like that your resources hang around, but the story of the game doesn't appeal all that much -- and I really like space games. The game does have a narrative arc, which I appreciate, but it feels a little too narrow and scripted. This would probably improve with expansions, but I haven't played with any.

what I like:

what I don't like:
- not very strategic (more tactical)
- depends a lot on player order

- not much variety in the cards
- takes too long in relation to the strategic possibilities
- anticlimactic ending (only core worlds and prestige cards left)

Very much like a meatier Ascension wherein each player plays a small portion of a turn in sequence, This turns decision-making from a trivial component of the game to a significant one. On the other hand, one of the primary selling points of Ascension is that it's so quick and mindless; Core Worlds, on the other hand, took us two+ hours to play ten turns. Analysis Paralysis with five players (three of whom were new to the game) was almost unbearable. The amount of micro-management and pre-planning was unwelcome given the amount of chaos that four other players bring to the game. That said, the mechanics of Core Worlds are elegant and the rules are straightforward. It's not quite the experience I hoped it would be when I read about it on BGG, but I'd like to give it another shot.

Core Worlds is a very focused engine-building game. I enjoy the competition for limited planets. Having only two turns per sector forces you to choose only the most important items to add to your deck, rather than hoping to capture everything.

The experience improves with more than two players, allowing more draft options (and corresponding strategies) to emerge.

It has just the right amount of complexity to be a satisfying experience.

RATING: 6
Space deckbuilder with the main focus on resource management (energy and actions) and a set amount of turns. Offers some variety but only little player interaction. Should last 1-2 turns more for my taste, it's almost over when you get the good stuff. Also pretty random, it's hard to plan ahead.

I seem to like this more than most people I've played it with. Definitely can overstay its welcome so I have trouble getting it to the table. 

Actually, my biggest complaint (and this issue may have something to do with the play length) is the lack of iconography. For some reason, that gets billed as a selling point. I shouldn't have to read a bunch of text scattered across 20 different cards every turn.  Give me some symbols so I can tell what they all do at a glance.

Most of my current favorite games are sci-fi card games and Core Worlds is the deck builder of the lot. But it is a hybrid in which you juggle between the deck building aspect and a highly dynamic tableau aspect. [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/969338/some-thoughts-after-ten-plays]I have defined[/url] CW as a "puzzle builder" in which the player slowly builds a disguised math problem that he will have to solve in the final phase of the game. The art is pure space opera and will enchant any reader of Asimov and Clarke and Herbert. Under the surface, the game has the balance and tightness of a good eurogame. At the end of the day, however, it is more intellectually satisfying than fun per se, and that keeps it a notch bellow 10. And it can be very exhausting too, although it is not a long game if there are no AP victims around. Another small downside is setup time: lots of decks to sort and shuffle.

I was expecting a bit more from this.  Yes, I was only playing the base game, and supposedly the expansions make it a lot better, but I expect that the base game will be good right off the bat.

I don't mind the 10 round limit, and the various cards seem to do good things, although I didn't really feel like I was doing anything other that getting cards and playing them.  The theme didn't really carry through for me.

Perhaps I'm not that big a fan of deck builder-tableau builder hybrids.

A deck builder that doesn't feel like a deck builder. You are buying cards but the main focus is on colonizing planets. It has an interesting mechanism where you can deploy troops which then stay in play for multiple rounds as long as you don't use them.

You have to shape your deck up to be able to colonize the core worlds at the end of the game. The artwork is okay and the theme is nice but it is the gameplay that makes this game great.

RATING: 7.5
I really enjoyed my first game with interesting decisions between conquering worlds and picking up better units and tactics to prepare for conquering better worlds in the future. 
[b]Pros:[/b]
- A bevy of difficult choices
- It's fairly tight, as energy (the currency of the game) is not plentiful and there's usually "one more thing" I want to do but can't.
- The idea of having your army in a deck that you're cycling through is pretty cool, although not as different from Dominion as I was expecting.
- It features great artwork.
- Fighting over grabbing from a very limited set of units and worlds increases player interaction and adds to a lot of good gamer angst - more so than in Dominion.

[b]Potential Cons:[/b]
It's enough fun that I would consider rating it an 8.5.  But what brings it down a couple of notches for me is:
- The game ends with me feeling like I still didn't get enough time to make good use of my deck. I won't be cycling through it as often as I would in Dominion, and cards bought in the last third of the game will probably only be used once, if at all.
- I worry a little about replayability. My faction will develop different strengths and weaknesses throughout the game, but the goals don't change much from game to game. The same exact core world cards are available at the end in every game.
- There is not as much control as it may first appear. There's a decent chance that no matter what I do, a player will snatch the world card I really want away from me depending on turn order and which cards come up. There are ways to be prepared for anything, but then that strategy is relatively straightforward and doesn't change much from game to game (build up fleet AND ground strength)

Egy újabb deckbuilding, de szerencsére elég egyedire sikerült. 
A külcsínt sokan dicsérik, amivel nem teljesen értek egyet. Nagyon jók a grafikák, de valahogy sikerült egy full unalmas keretbe foglalni őket. Jó lett volna, ha hangsúlyosabbak lettek volna a képek, valahogy a keret nagyon elvonja a figyelmet, talán túl nagy...
A játékmenet hangulatos, tematikus. Rengetegféle kártya van, ami egyfelől nagyszerű, mert nagy az újrajátszhatóság, többféle taktikát ki lehet próbálni, másfelől viszont nehézkessé teszi a játékot. Így leginkább azoknak ajánlanám, akiknél sokszor elő tud kerülni, mert csak akkor válik pörgőssé. Rengeteg a szöveg a kártyákon, és ugye majdnem mind különböző, így nekünk az első 3 fős játék több, mint 2 órát tartott. Ahogy látom hivatalosan is 90 perc a játékidő, ami azért szerintem kicsit sok egy ilyen játékhoz. Még egy-két negatívom (már akinek): eléggé számolós és multiplayer soliter. A kettő kicsit össze is függ, mert örülsz, ha a saját támadóerődet ki tudod számítani előre de esélyed sincs a másokét is kalkulálgatni. Emiatt a két probléma miatt elég sok a holt idő is, mivel mindenki számolgat a körében, de interakció hiányában nem igazán érdekel senkit, hogy mire jut. :)

RATING: 6
In Core Worlds players draft their decks from an ever-changing shared card pool. Expect the first couple of games to take quite a bit more time for digesting the card texts. There is a structure to the pool, though, so in general cards get better and better during the game, to a certain degree forcing players to keep up.

Much of the tension comes from the choice between expanding your empire for points and energy, or stocking up on better troops to facilitate expansion later on. You typically need both but opportunities are severely restricted by energy requirements and available actions and even neglecting your fellow players for a moment, cards cycle out of the pool if you wait too long.

Compared to other offerings in the genre, Core Worlds is a rather slow burner. There is little in the way of frantic card grabbing, the card combos, while certainly present, are fairly tame, and the limited number of actions per turn provides a natural barrier to just running away with it. Kind of thematically appropriate, you could say. At the same time, it's those minor nuances that decide the game in the end, and it seems like turn order can be quite an advantage when the right cards turn up. Similarly, trying to forecast your energy consumption for the turn without knowing what will be in the pool feels odd, and a single energy unit more or less can be huge. I can see how doing it differently would easily invite excessive AP but I wish this would have been solved differently. As it is it almost requires intimate card knowledge.

RATING: 8
So it turns ou that this is a pretty cool game. It is reminiscent of the Firefly/Serenity world, although it has nothing to do with whimsy of the crew. It is a deckbuilder done in phases where cards come out in grous as we race to the center of the galaxy where the core worlds are so we can try and conquer them. Everything works really well although it takes a while to wrap your mind around the first game, especially with the expansion built in.

I think pretty highly of this one; it's not "just another deckbuilder" but has a lot of empire building, drafting but more importantly PLAYING your fleets, managing your resources.  The action is tight, and even though the interaction is indirect it can get pretty cutthroat.

It's possible I'll like this even more with repeat plays.  We'll just have to see.  Bring on the expansion!

Finally - a game that takes deck-building ideas (if not purely its mechanics) and makes a different sort of game out of it. Core Worlds is thematically strong. The artwork is fantastic. The decisions that have to be made are tough, and are made tough by the limited resources and selection of strong cards available. The effects of certain cards are smart and well executed. The game flow is fluid and not at all clunky. I have an issue with how much space this takes up on the table.  Also, the mathy-ness and large selection of cards for 4+ players creates a lot of AP at times and the first few games are going to drag into 2-3 hours (which is too long for this game in my opinion).  Also, using one symbol for two different things keeps the graphic design cleaner, but can be confusing for new players.  (For example, the Energy symbol might mean Energy Generation or Energy Cost; the Fleet/Ground strength symbols might mean Card Strength or Strength Required to Colonize World).  Overall, a very strong card game and one that is worth the time.

I will always play with the pre-draft rules.  Also, I was once convinced that including Galactic Orders always was required, but I think it makes the game a little too intimidating for new players.  (Not the mechanics, but simply that it adds one too many things to track, considering the base game is already very text-heavy all by itself.)

This is probably at the top of deck-builders for me at the moment (although I guess it isn't quite a pure deck builder).
The game play is fast and fun, every game sees your deck becoming more and more powerful, and there is a nice amount of strategy given the option to hold troops instead of cycling them back to dilute your deck.

UPDATE - Okay, this is definitely my favorite deck-builder (except maybe Mage Knight, but I'm not sure that counts). The game gives you the chance to make major tactical and strategic decisions every turn. 

No strategy is a given. I've won games by barely conquering any early worlds, instead putting a ton of guys down and spamming the energy tactic to keep up with my opponents. But I've also attacked planets over and over again, gotten to the point where I am producing 19 energy a turn, played tons of huge cards from my hand, and conquered two separate core worlds.

This game is truly spectacular, and it sounds like the expansion (preordered!) will only improve on it.

Update - Traded. It's a good design, but takes too long for a deckbuilder, and doesn't feel epic enough for the time invested.

I play with both expansions and it is epic. Deckbuilder and empire building game in one. So much fun, this is a big hit with my group. 

Analysis Paralysis is a big problem for my group with deckbuilders but I like that Core Worlds has a static central board for the most part between turns so while others are taking their turns you can be planning your own turn and not get bored. This is unlike Ascension where you never know what cards will be in the middle board once it is your turn so you can't really plan while it is other player's turns so it can get really boring. Same with Dominion, you never know what extra cards you will draw during your turn so you can't really plan your turn ahead of time.

Combines elements from both deck-building games (like Dominion) and tableau-building games (like Race for the galaxy) and creates something that is not very unique, but still works very well. 

The key to this is that the game avoids some of the common problems present in many cardgames in general and deck-building games in particular. In a game with many cards and a good amount of synergies to explore and takes several plays to learn the cards. Some cards will not show up, but you know that all the core worlds will and you can therefore plan for the end game. Instead the foci lies in hand and deck management. Since new and better cards will show up during the game you have a sense of progression.

Time will tell how I feel about the game. There are two main concerns I have. The first game felt a little slow and I hope it will speed up with further plays. I am also wondering how replayable it is as I can see that similar tactics can be used from game to game.

Un juego que recuerda mas a los típicos juegos de desarrollo mas que a un juego de construccion de mazos. El juego es algo complejo por la cantidad de diferentes cartas que tiene y requiere curva de aprendizaje, esto unido a que tiene bastante tiempos muertos puede hacer que el juego resulte largo.

El análisis parálisis se produce principalmente al inicio del turno, cuando tienes que optimizar tu mano para intentar conseguir el mayor beneficio posible, la verdad es que muchos de estos juegos de construccion de mazos me ha parecido que tienen una mecánica que tiende al oportunismo.

El juego tiene cosas interesantes, la forma en que se construye el mazo y la sinergías que se producen entre distintos tipos de cartas producen efectos interesantes, a diferencia del dominion las cartas a elegir salen al azar y eso también le da su punto.

Para finalizar decir que el juego es bastante tenso y te obliga a tomar decisiones difíciles, en la recta final los errores se pagan caros, pero también me pareció un producto amateur, sin acabado profesional, le falta desarrollo, es absurdo tener que llevar la cuenta de puntos de acción y energía, ya que normalmente te adaptas a los recursos según vas avanzando el juego, con llevar la cuenta de la energía habría bastado.

This is a fine deck building game that gives the players more control than most others of this kind. Most deck builders are tactical and less so strategic, while this one is the opposite of that.

The gameplay itself is more like a race, as the game is really running away. You don't see many of the cards, not even your own ones and here and there it has a very strange feel to it. Strange like having scoring cards mainly in the last deck of cards and some of those (prestige) arn't of high value. I get the point, that the worlds need to be conquered, while the prestige ones can be bought, but it still feels strange to me. I probably feel this way, as I dislike this "mechanism" of saving the scoring cards for the last turns.

One of the better deckbuilders out there, but still nothing I need to own.

Core Worlds is a thematic deck-building game with some hand-management/resource management mechanisms as well, but which focuses on well-timed actions which are very thematic and which honestly immerse players in the game more than the deck-building.

Unlike Dominion, where the idea is basically pile/points accumulation, or Thunderstone, where players either go into the dungeon and fight something-or-one goes to the village and works on their deck if the hand isn't useful, Core Worlds has a very limited number of rounds with multiple actions available per round, but with a definite goal of claiming a useful world each set of actions.

In and of itself, this focused time frame helps the game tremendously, and makes it feel tighter and more competitive.

The backstory is very reminiscent of H. Beam Piper's Space Viking, (not the first game so indebted, e.g., Dwarfstar's Star Viking) in that players start with limited forces and build up from there, only taking on enemies within their capacity as they have strengthened their empire.

1st player alternates over the 10 rounds, which gives a slight advantage to the start player, but only if they are equally prepared to act with the other players.

Players may attack a world once per round, and may use their limited energy to take other actions, such as deploying forces for use, or claiming additional cards.

The limited number of actions, and the tight supply of energy makes players focus on the actions and their order, not so much on the decks, and it keeps the theme of the game very present for everyone.

Even after only a 1st play this is the best themed deck-builder I have yet played, and certainly threatens to go up in my personal ratings w/additional plays. I am starting this at a 7.25 (jumping over both Dominion and Thunderstone) and I will certainly be pulling this out to play again soon!

Raised to a 7.5 after 6 plays- this is just a really good game overall, even before Galactic Orders arrives.

Escalated to a 7.75 after 8 plays- if I have the time for a long Deck-builder this is probably the one I'll reach for rather than Thunderstone.

I really like the fact that you have to get your shit together halfway through the game otherwise you'll lose.

Gameplay wise the need to balance a thin deck with drafting new units all the while keeping your strategy aimed towards those coreworlds that you really need to win makes it hard for me.
but I love the artwork and the game is here to stay.

A good card-drafting, deck-building game.  No mechanisms that haven't been done before but they all mesh together to form a cohesive whole.

Great theme and good mechanics. Not much player interaction.  You only indirectly interfere with the other players - by taking the cards or invading worlds before they get a chance to.

An above-average deck builder with a space conquest theme. About half your VPs come from the world you conquer at the end of the game (plus bonuses) so you need to build towards that from the outset, you can't just ignore the endgame and try to score along the way, it doesn't work. This gives the game a rather samey feel, you need to choose what you're shooting for and hope to be well-enough positioned to get it before someone else. The game also seems to run a bit long for what it is, less would have been more.

RATING: 8
I was a playtester, and I consider Andy Parks a friend, so my opinion is far from impartial.  Still, this is a very good game and an interesting take on the deckbuilding genre. Like a couple other games (A Few Acres of Snow, Mage Knight), it takes the idea of deckbuilding and puts it in the context of an interesting game with other things going on.  

Core Worlds is really a drafting game with a high degree of planning involved, and these are some of my favorite things. The deck building element adds a lot, and combining drafting with deck building means that players have a lot of freedom to build an individualized deck that's different every time.  So that's fun.  

The game is not short--it's true--but just because it's a card game doesn't mean it has to be short.  (5+ plays)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Currently my favorite deck-builder. And that is because the theme is something that really draws me in. Each player takes on the role of a barbarian empire on the fringes of the galaxy. The ancient Galactic Realm, rules from the Core Worlds, is crumbling. Now is the time to act and seize power by invading worlds that belonged to the old order. You'll need infantry, star-fighters, tanks, cruisers, robots, heroes, and capital ships to make your invasions successful.

This is a more complicated deck-builder because there is just a lot going on. There are four different kinds of "currencies": Action points, Energy, Fleet Strength and Ground Strength. And you need to spend them in the most efficient way possible...otherwise your rivals will get the upper hand on you.

I enjoy watching this game being played. As the game goes on you get to see your empire growing with all the different planets in your war-zone. Artwork is very well done. The only complaint is that I wish it could have done better with the graphic design. Also, you really need to play this with its first expansion, Galactic Orders.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Complex deck-builder (especially with expansions) with very streamlined content. It mixes an active, evolving central market (Ascension-style) with distinct decks (Dominion-style), and special ways to thin your deck, all wrapped up in a thematic galaxy conquest outfit. One of the best (if not the best) deck-builders ever made!

There was a lot to like here, and I was quite reluctant to let it go for ages, but in the end I felt that:

1) The deckbuilding missed out on the most fun part of that mechanic, which is building the cool combo and watching it go off again and a gain as your deck cycles. Since there are so few turns, you might only see the cards you buy once or twice, so your uber combo may not even happen. Quite un-fun.

2) The number of ways you could play each hand actually became exhausting, especially with Galactic Orders added into the mix. It just turned into five minutes of mental arithmetic, working out the various permutations of adding x to that card, or y to that other one. I don't mind that in games, like Mage Knight for example, which is a big epic puzzle, but I was hoping for more of a 'pew pew' feel here. Not the game's fault.

3) It just lasted far too long for the amount of game that's in there. One three player game took over three hours. For a medium-weight deckbuilder, that's just too much as far as I'm concerned. The decisions, although complex in a fiddly arithmetical min-maxing ways, aren't interesting enough to sustain that length.

Round-based, deck building game.  I liked the mix.  And once you have a handle on some of the cards / core world that provide the big victory points at game end, the game really starts to shine.

The game is a wee-bit long for a true deck-builder, so plan accordingly.

The expansion is a terrific addition.  Actually the uncommon instance where the expansion actually helps the game.

Dec11:

Rather disappointing.  Much of the idea I like a lot.  I like the deck building mixed with a permanent tableau.  I love the variety of cards and the merciless progression of power.

But, all the minor math kills it.  You spend far too damn much time figuring out if you have enough energy to do a certain set of actions.  Hell, you spend too much time figuring out if you have enough action points to do your chosen actions.  And don't even get me started on the staggeringly slow pace the game takes on once you see the core worlds.  It's all about beating 1-2 core worlds, but the permutations and opportunity costs are far too calculable and yet time consuming.

I like the progressive style of play (i.e. sectors).  It actually feels like you are going deeper and deeper into the game as things go along.  Plus, who wouldn't want to be a space barbarian sacking a dying galactic empire???

Update:  Together with Galactic Orders, this has simply become my favorite game.  From 9 to 10.  Though, I am more liberal with 10's than most.  But any flaws the game has are so inconsequential to my personal overall experience with it, it's pointless to even call them "negatives".

By far the best deckbuilder I have played, mostly because the deckbuilding is the means to a rather interesting end (rather than being the whole game).

Each turn is filled with things I actually [i]want[/i] to do.

Having played the game many times in many possible combinations, my preferred setup is the base game components plus:

Zero-round draft

Events

Advancements (including Capital City)

Consuls of the Empire

Dagda core world

This results in a sufficiently varied game that is much more streamlined than it would be with galactic orders and/or heroic tactics.

RATING: 6
Another attempt at a streamlined 4x game.  It has some charm, but also tends to drag.  Like many deck building games, it has a group solitare component.  However, deducing what your other player's are planning on actually IS important.  But to do so, requires extensive squinting, as you try and discern other player's capabilities by reading smallish icons, and impossibly small text.  This all takes time and can make the game drag.  However, the progressive decks are clever and the evolution of technology and capability are well done.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (December 2015)

At last I got to play Core Worlds. It is a deckbuilder game that features a variable market offering, a mechanism I really dislike as I found it to be very unfair. Still, I enjoyed the game.

The rules are easy to learn and teach but the gameplay is VERY slow with more than 3 players so I feel 2 players is its best configuration. Besides, with more players the uncontrollable luck creeps up.

The art is ok. Love the theme but I don’t feel it through the game.

Core Worlds has some interesting decisions, but they aren’t very deep, so the game really needs to move at a fast pace or it bores me.

The variable market offering always bothers me in games, however, in Core Worlds the cards stay for one round at least. This is a lot better than most deckbuilder games  because it is a lot fairer toward the players. Still it has some uncontrollable luck with the “luck of the draw”, moreover when the turn order changes and a new player become the first player (he has first chance to buy a powerful card). I also feel some cards are much better than others (for example the one that let you score planets that doesn’t regularly give VPs, that card is comparable in VPs as a Core World), but in general the game feels balanced.

Bottom line, Core Worlds is perhaps my favorite deckbuilder game that features variable market offering. I feel there is considerable luck with the unique cards and I dislike that a player has the opportunity to buy them first only because he plays before others (that is, player order is VITAL and UNFAIR and there is nothing you can do about this). This issue prevents me from buying the game. For now I won’t say no to a game of Core Worlds, but only if we are 3 players or less. Perhaps it is too long for what it offers.

A decent deck builder but you probably don't play long enough to benefit from what you are building.  The rounds ebb and flow with the way you build up your forces to conquer a planet and then lose a round while you look to build up your forces again.  I probably havn't found the balance of building and utiliseing forces but I do enjoy the idea and theme of the game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This one really impressed me. It really captures the conquer-the-galaxy genre in a card game playable in an hour or so. The space-opera sense is much stronger than in Race, giving you a feeling of working through the galaxy towards the center, and you can (and must) prepare for the endgame. It is longer than Race, and I think less varied, but really good. 

I think if you added some kind of tech tree to this, you'd have the ultimate space opera card game. Add a third to the play time, add some form of technology tree, and some more direct pvp conflict, and you'd have TI3 in card form.

But, as it is, very enjoyable. So far, _I think_ better than Eminent Domain in terms of last years space card games.

Core Worlds is a well-designed game with streamlined mechanics, excellent synergy, and high repeat playability. Offers the experience of deckbuilding without shuffling ad nauseum.

Yay, a deck building game, that I actually like :D Does not feel like race for the galaxy at all, nor does it feel like Eminent Domain, so I dont know why the games have to be constantly compared. Only played 2 times as of this writing. I suck at builing my deck, but I still have fun :) First game took 2 hours, next one 1½ (including rules explanation and setup), but I could imagine it being a longer game with more than 2 players. Would be nice to see more cards in the dispaly though. 
It is VERY much multiplayer solitaire, even though you can ofcourse draft/hatedraft, but I dont mind. I have enought confrontational games anyway. Only played with the expansion, and I would never play without. It adds so much 'game'. Thumbs up

Decent deck-builder in the Dominion mold. 

While lacking any obvious rough edges, Core Worlds just feels rather unnecessary to me. You spend energy to draft more powerful cards, use those cards to invade worlds that produce more energy --> snowball from there. Just not a lot of meat to the tactical decisions, and not a lot of character or diversity to the card set. 

It works. I'm not entirely sure what it offers that Dominion doesn't aside from an SF theme (and a longer playtime). I'm not a big Dominion fan in the first place, and for SF I'd turn to plenty of other games. Hence, "unnecessary." 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I find there aren't enough interesting decisions in the game. Especially long term strategic ones. Most of what you're doing is optimizing each turn and trying to decide if you want to draft a card or invade a planet. A lot of the mechanics are very nice and the game definitely works well but doesn't appeal to me much.

A decent deckbuilder with trashing cards built in as one of the central mechanics. As much as I enjoy it, the long play time means it doesn't get played much. Truthfully I find games of Dominion to have as many decisions packed in 20 minutes as opposed to 2 hours of Core Worlds.

I'm not impressed. 10 rounds with a 16-card starting deck means the first 3 turns are pretty fixed, and the choices don't feel terribly meaningful. Nice theme, but I don't really feel like I'm assembling this powerful force to conquer an empire; it feels like I'm scrapping together a rebellion hoping to have a slightly larger rebellion than my neighbor. 

Many cool ideas / mechanics, but the scale/scope feels off. Generally, Dominion is the better game, and this is inferior with respect to gameplay and mechanics, despite a nice theme.

Some neat mechanics here, but it's a bit frustrating that your engine really only starts firing just as the game ends. For that reason, it feels longer than it should, as you spend the whole game just building up and waiting for the last turn.

RATING: 7
For three players or four fast ones I like this game. It's a nice take on deckbuilding where the focus is really more about building up forces and game flow than the base mechanism (which Dominion does well).

RATING: 8
Not too happy about the science fiction theme, but this is one of the first deck builders that doesn't feel like a simple derivative of Dominion.  There's some definite planning involved since you the objectives are somewhat fixed.  I've enjoyed my plays of this game so far, though I can see that the play time is the biggest factor.  If we can consistently play in 45 minutes, I will be happy.  I can see how the game could drag out for some people, and I would not be willing to play this for much longer than an hour.

Excellent variation on the deck-building genre. Aside from issues with the symbology, this is an excellent card-drafting and world conquering game. Personally I find it replaces Race for the Galaxy because it scratches the same itch but the game is better implemented and more streamlined.

I really like the theme of this game.  It doesn't feel like a deckbuilding game, and has a nice feeling of progression.

The things that keep me from rating it higher are:

1.  Doesn't scale super well with different player counts. There just aren't enough cards available to pursue a specific strategy in a two player game.  You basically just have to buy whatever is available.  Conversely, games with larger amounts of players are too long (imo), and despite having more cards available to draft, the competition is that much fiercer for those cards, making it just as hard to create a compelling deck/strategy.

2.  Great card art, but ugly graphic design in my opinion.  Also, white borders.

The best Deckbuilder out there in my opinion - the base game is nice but with the first expansion (the bigger box) it really shines (actually I believe it should've shipped with the expansion content from the beginning). The Revolutions-Expansion is not a must have, but a nice addition and adds options for the more experienced group.

Very solid game, which can cause headaches but fortunately has a time limit on it, else it would lose its balance. Can't play it more than twice in a row, though.

I heard several mixed reviews on this game.  I will try anything new once.  It being my first game, I was totally lost.  People say that it is a "Deck Builder", but you honestly don't have a lot of cards to work with, and experienced players will dominate newbie players like me.  Plus my game we used an expansion thrown in as well, so that didn't help things.  The game took way too long for my taste, ten rounds???  I started to lose interest about round three or four.  I also noticed that the experienced players tend have Analysis Paralysis during the entire game, so that I think drags it out.  Not too many ways to score points until way later in the game.  So, I will probably never play this game again!

A rather simple space themed deck builder. Rated with the Galactic Orders expansion. I probably wouldn't play the game without it, since I couldn't see the game being complete without the events and galactic center area control fight. The game shouldn't take that long, but it seems prone to AP. Very tactical deckbuilder, so players have to reanalyze if one of their moves is taken. You have to be in the right place at the right time. The fact that the available cards don't replenish in the tableau as they're taken makes for a lot of letdown when someone gets a card or invades the world you were planning on invading. Not sure of the balance of the cards either. Still, I prefer this to any other tactical deckbuilder out there I've played. Probably wouldn't play with the full 5 again.

Thinking about this because of Ken B's review.

Update: a year later, it's my 2013 birthday present from me.

Update: after four two-player plays, I think I'm about done with this two-player; hopefully it's better with three.  With two, you see very little of each deck (but of course it has to be that way, because otherwise there's no "I hope he doesn't take that thing I want" tension).

Update: playing with 3 didn't make me love it.  Yeah, you "do stuff," but the stuff you do just isn't that exciting.  Calling it a 4.

After a video review:

The management of actions and energy seems very fiddly and it seem to break the flow of the game and make it must less elegant to play than other deck buildings game where you simply play your hand.

After some real game play

I completely agree with the sentence above. I think the actions should simply have been removed from the game. You have limited energy and cards, you are eventually run out of resources. There is no need to restrict actions too. You always end up in a situation where, you have either energy or actions left, but not both. But you need both for everything.

So as a variant rules, do not count actions, when you are out of cards in hand or on the board, or when you are out of energy, your turn is over.

Another problem with this game is that there is no deck thinning, so near the end of the game, you are going to draw a hand with only basic cards, making it completely useless. Maybe instead of discarding 2 cards to get 1 energy, they should have said destroy 1 card to get 1 energy.

The game flow is very slow and you deck does not cycle much. I think from all the cards I bought, 1-2 cards managed to get used twice. Others were mostly all used once. So it does not worth it to go into all that deck building effort for little use. No deck thinning also make them hard to draw.

In rune age the game flow is easy and relatively fast to resolve. Once you played that game, it's hard to get into something as slow core worlds when the depth level of both games is similar.

The cards are designed so that you can built a deck toward a strategy or game style. But having little chance to use your cards and having other players steal the cards you want before you, it is hard to build a strategy deck.

In rune age, each faction already has a play style, so you really get to build a strategy deck.

And to end it all, there is no player vs player battles. But the reason why there is no such battle is probably not because they could not do it, but because the game is so slow, that it would be unplayable.

I really like the idea of a space card game, this one just does not fit for me.

Another random comment: Mixing planets and unit cards together is just unelegant.

Really was avoiding this one figuring it would not be my cup of tea but I was clearly wrong - loved my first play!

This game is an interesting combination of deckbuilding, strategizing to limit your deck/set yourself up for future drafts/invasions, combos, and special powers.  Expect the first game to take over a couple hours as people agonize over options despite the fairly simple ruleset.  This is going to be one of those games where experienced players will likely do much better since they know the rules.  Timing is everything in this game as you try to set yourself up for the turns where you are early in turn order.  This is largely multiplayer solitaire outside of the competition for the draft of cards/invasions of common planets.  No player vs player combat or aggression.  Be sure to have a good supply of energy by the midgame in order to be able to take your desired actions.

Yet another deck builder that takes a proven formula and adds enough tweaks to make it a compelling game.  I like how the drafting does not leave ou with particularly large decks and that the cards therefore cycle frequently..  Balancing energy and actions seems vital as does finding those winning combinations.

Definitely one of my favorite games, the narrative and theme of this one is just so strong. It's a bit mathsy, but I really like that aspect so I'm good with it. With new players I think this one is only for 2-3, if most people have played before I'll go to 4, but 5 is probably right out. You should definitely let people overlap turns if they are deploying/figuring out the best way to conquer a planet to keep the game moving. But such a blast to play!

Unless its expansion makes some changes, this is the game I will want to be playing when I’m playing Eminent Domain. This is the deck-building space game to go for. (To be fair, though, there isn’t much interaction short of “I need to grab that before you do” and it goes on WAAAAY long with 5 players.) This one feels like I’m conquering planets and building up a space empire. As with Thunderstone, it’s a deckbuilder in which I do more than just shuffle cards around and get more cards. I’m curious as to how it plays with 2, and I’m also curious about the expansion. (I have heard that, like Eminent Domain, this too can get repetitive after only a few plays.)

For sure, don't play just Core Worlds without the expansion.  Totally boring without it.  

Although even with it...not the best game.  It's a balanced game, it's thematic (I do feel like I have a space empire that is conquering planets), but totally rigid.  The game has several self-pacing mechanisms.  You have 10 rounds, and in rounds 9-10 you can only invade core worlds for victory points.  While self-pacing does set a tone/pace, it doesn't make me enjoy a game--it makes me feel bored.

It seems fairly balanced...except for that the 6 factions (the ones that Galactic Orders introduces) are not quite balanced.  I guess different ones are better in different situations...but I totally won the game I played for the sole reason that I cashed in some Mystic Brotherhood tokens on the last round, so I got 3 core worlds while the other guy (who was ahead the rest of the game) only got 1.

Again, it's not a terrible game, but it's just so self-paced that it doesn't make you excited about all the possibilities of making your own strategy or anything.  Another self-pacing mechanism is that every time you invade a planet, you have the option of basically trashing one of your weak cards.  Deckbuilders like Dominion forced you to consider trashing as tactic to employ in your strategy; this game just does it for you automatically.  

So if you want deckbuilders to be self-pacing and do several things for you, then this may be for you.

But on the other hand, I didn't feel like I had that many choices every round.  You have several turns in a round, but those turns accumulate to you doing one thing, usually.  For instance, turn 1, you deploy troops.  Turn 2, you invade a planet.  It takes several actions to deploy your troops and one action to invade, so you're done at that point.  Well, a lot of times there are only 2 planets to invade, and if your opponent already has troops out, and he's going for the only planet you can invade, then forget it--invading isn't a choice.  

Or take a different situation, where you want to buy some awesome non-world card.  But there is only one non-world card out there that would help your deck as it is right now.  So yay, one choice.  Or, if your opponent gets it first, then you are left with no choice for what you actually wanted, so you take a mediocre action.

I like games that make you feel like you have tons of GREAT choices, so even if you can't get your first pick, you can take your second pick and be flexible with your strategy.  That is not this game at all!

Core Worlds strikes out an interesting place in deck-building.  Purchase strategies doesn't dominate the game, but it resonates throughout each decision.  Play strategy takes a much more prominent role than in a game like Dominion; what to do on any given turn is not scripted in the slightest, and the constant clock of approaching the Core puts so much pressure on what had previously been a fairly light-weight genre.

If I've got a couple of hours, this is my favorite deckbuilder. It is undeniably slow-paced and thinky, though the rules are well-thought-out to limit that tendency -- you're required to commit to some of your resource allocation before you see new cards available for purchase. Some people will be unhappy with this sequence, because of the blind planning involved, but I like that it says up front that you just can't try to calculate everything to the last bit of detail (as you could really take all day doing that).

The action sequencing ends up feeling a good bit like a worker placement game. You can do this thing now, that's pretty good, or do that thing there to set up a really good combo the next time around the table -- unless your opponent grabs that next step first. "Best available" vs "best long-term" is always a good dilemma.

This game really shines when combined with the first expansion, Galactic Orders. The base game is entirely playable on its own, but CW:GO really fleshes things out.

Rating go up to 8. Despite its length (~2.5 hours as almost each session has some new players in my table), we still find lots to explore and enjoy this game way more than any other deck builders. It also favours strategic play rather than the Dominion's 'spot diagnosis'. Strongly recommended.

Interesting card drafting game. It has a good bit in common with Dominion, Ascension, and Eminent Domain. It goes deeper than these other games in strategic choices, but this also adds to length of play.

Played a game which revealed a gamey strategy to rapidly thin a deck and be virtually assured to draw cards drafted on the prior turn and accelerate Galactic Order token gains. Impact may not be as strong as I suspect, but for now I have the impression that it would break the game.

RATING: 8
A well-scripted narrative arc is something that a lot of my favorite boardgames share, whether it is the nile flood of Amun-Re, the ever-increasing actions of Agricola, the seasons in Rune Wars ... well, I certainly have a lot of favorites. In Core Worlds, you lead an initial fleet of primitive doofuses on their conquests through increasingly sophisticated planet systems, picking up more and more nice stuff that goes kaboom, until you finally reach the core world systems with their impressive defenses and just as impressive rewards.

Although it still a large debt of inspiration to Dominion, this is one of the welcome games that expand and add the basic idea of deckbuilding, instead of just being an inevitably weaker carbon copy. Apart from the structured buildup of cards you can buy or invade, the main innovation is the war zone, where you deploy troops you can later throw at fresh new conquerable planets. Deploying a lot of your cards makes you more predictable, but it allows you to react faster to new targets and has the subtle effect of thinning your deck.

This is only one of the strategic routes I’d like to explore here, and this interest along with the excellent art and smooth gameplay makes this a game I’ll certainly play again and might even buy.

RATING: 3
Not even sure where to start with this one, so this will likely be a rambling rant.  

This game seems like the disowned love child of 7 Wonders and Dominion.  Like someone said, "hey, people like deck building, and they like card drafting, if we put them together we'll have chocolate covered peanut butter", but the result was not very good.

The randomness of the card draft and only partially played decks did not mesh well with the randomness of the built deck. 

The fact that new cards are flipped for the draft after players have decided about energy production stifles planning.

This game seems to be trying to seduce the player with strategic planning, but almost every move is purely tactical.  The inability to hold energy resources from turn to turn compounds the issue.

In the third from the last turn, I only had 4 cards left in my draw deck after drawing my cards.  Those four cards contained at least one of my 7 cost ships.  Instead of drawing that I got a couple of energy tactics cards, a couple of invasion tactics cards, and a couple of cheap units.  This meant that I ended that turn with 14 energy I could not use (not much came up to buy, they were mostly planets that I couldn't get.  

This meant that most of my energy in the last two turns was spent getting my big ships on the table.  If I had drawn that ship in the third from the last turn I could have not only invaded one additional planet, but I could have bought an extra VP card.  This one lousy drawn foiled any chance I had in the game.  If you could do *something* with extra energy then it might not be so bad.

The guy who taught this said it was better with 3, but I'm not sure it's worth the effort.  This game has already wasted 2.5 hours of my life.

Love the theme and mechanics of this this game, Best played with 3, works well with 4. I haven't tried 2 or 5 players yet. It is most fun when played with Galactic Orders expansion. I highly recommend this one for fans of Dune, Babylon 5 or BattleTech.

I like the premise of the barbarians sacking the core and I like the idea of using deck building as the technology tree mechanic so it seemed like a sure thing. Unfortunately the lack of any real conflict and the actual course of play turned out to be boring to me. I may tinker with it a bit, if I can get anyone to play it again.

Highly recommend the expansion.  Without it I can only recommend 3P and with it, 4P is quite good.  Rating includes the use of the expansion.  Good game, maybe a bit long for what it is, but still solid.  Fantastic card art - maybe the best for any game in my collection. I like the combination of draft/deckbuilding and the way they are implemented together. Close to a 10 for me, just love the whole look and feel of the game.

So far I like it very much. It seems that you always need just one more energy or one more action to accomplish everything you want to do, so you have to plan ahead for other turns. The way that cards stay on the table until you use them, also introduces some nice timing aspects.The artwork on the game is also very good and I like to look at my little army on the table.

the only downside seems to be that the game is longer dan most deck-building games I know, but I'm hoping this will improve after I become more familiar with the cards.

Update: After three games I find I want to like it more than I actually do. It´s too long and calculational, and the endgame can be annoying for some if the cards come out in the wrong order. I´m willing to play again but will probably not ask for it. Too bad.

I'm not a huge fan of deck-builders, but I do like this one and I prefer it to [family=5321][/family] (and I have both [thing=85897][/thing] and [thing=116998][/thing]. It has a "Marketplace" where you buy your stuff from and different stuff becomes available through the game. You play your cards to your tableau, paying to do so and you spend the cards from the tableau to achieve the game goal - which also provides you with currency generators. Very elegant. There's strategy in deciding your end goal and on getting the timing right for the purchase of those last big VP cards at the end. I find that the end game is always a bit of a nail-biter as you try to spot who is going to buy which big card and to figure the optimum way to spend your last turn's resources.

12/10/11 Played a three-player game, that took 2.7 hours. The theme intrigued me, but I was leery of the deck building aspect, especially after the owner compared it to Dominion. That game wore out its welcome almost immediately with me due to the constant card shuffling. I can however attest that's not an issue in Core Worlds. I think I only shuffled three times. The flow of the game is all quite logical and fits the theme. The card's text are well done, and the icons fairly well done (quite *unlike* Race for the Galaxy). The art is merely serviceable. The goals are clear. The player boards are well done. Well, that's all the good points. 

However there are two related facets that drag the game down into a black hole. First, it takes f-o-r-e-v-e-r to play, which I certainly didn't expect for a card game. Second, the big reason it takes so long is the frustration factor (or analysis paralysis if you prefer) of half the turns one takes. Plopping down fresh forces usually takes a minimal amount of time.  But trying to figure out what planet, if any, can one conquer can drag on a very long time. For one often has to consult the text on several cards to see if their bonuses will give one enough fleet/ground factors to take a world. Then you have to figure out whether using said card's special function(s) will deplete your energy reserves so much you can't legally launch the attack. I found myself today having to figure maybe four different card combinations for each planet. That burns your brain out after a couple of hours. When the owner started talking about some of the icons on the cards are for a planned expansion I thought, "Just shoot me now!" 

Also, there is zero player interaction, unless you consider grabbing a planet or force card before someone else interaction. There is room for some specialization strategy (robots, etc.) but I have no desire to know the game well enough to worry about that.

You know when you used to see those ads for X-Ray specs in comics, and you'd dream about how brilliant they would be? That's how much I want this. I just pray it's not as disappointing. Gimme, gimme, gimme...

Reviewing the comment above, I think this is a decent deck builder, but overlong. I hope Revolution adds something because, though there are interesting decisions, they're not interesting enough to make me want to play often. Coupled with that, the decent artwork is marred by some sober and rather dated graphic design. Card quality good; other components passable to decent. In short, a good game, but I can't help feeling a little short-changed.

Decent deck-builder. I like the varied and unique cards in the deck. It allows you to build combos as the game progresses. CW still suffers from the same problems that all deck-builders have to me, and that is that you can buy the perfect card, but not get it when you need it, and that can be a bit frustrating. Otherwise, OK game, and will play occasionally if asked.

Player workload remains incredibly high throughout the game.

Thanks, Secret Soloist!

[u]06-Jun-2014[/u]: This is a game I've wanted since its release.  The theme really appeals to me and in my newness to the hobby at the time, the deckbuilding mechanism was definitely a draw.  Recently, a SoloPlay variant was released, and this shot to top of my list.  Enter my Secret Soloist with his/her generosity, and both the base game and the first expansion are now mine!

As I said, this is a deckbuilding game with some resource management and limited actions per turn.  I would describe this as the next level up from Dominion within this genre of games.  It's still multiplayer solitaire, but being primarily a solo gamer means that works in my favor.  The addition to the Dominion style of gaming is the Warzone.  It's basically a personal tableau where you must play your Units (attack cards) first before they can invade any Worlds in the central area of play.

Like any deckbuilder, you start with a small deck of weaker cards; add stronger, better ones as the game progresses; gain VP along the way; until the final rounds of the game when the Core Worlds are available for you to unleash your mighty star fleet upon.

The first expansion adds a bit of complexity, Event cards, special powers, and some additional rules and cards for the base game.  It definitely makes Core World more complete and is well worth the additional funds.

The component quality is very good, and I love the artwork, card names, and theme.  This sits very well within my wheelhouse of gaming.

[u]09-Feb-2016[/u]:  I just realized that I never posted any “official” comments regarding the SoloPlay variant for this game.  So, here we go:

If you have played Core Worlds before, this variant, like many of the SoloPlay variants, changes up the basic gameplay to add enough “meat” for the solo player.

Here, there is a movement/spacial aspect to the “market” cards. There is a 3 x 4 grid the player can move through by spending Energy. You’ll then be able to take the usual Core Worlds actions like Deploy, Invade, and Draft, but for each action you take (other than movement), the AI will have a reaction. If you Invade, it will try to Draft a Tactics card. If you Deploy, it will Invade a World. And so on.

This variant is very thinky and puzzly. If you don’t enjoy planning several moves at a time, this may not be your jam.  For example, on a turn, I might want to Invade a World. However, I need to Deploy some units first. By doing so, I will trigger the AI to Invade and maybe take the World I wanted. So, instead, I might Draft a Unit card first. This will send the AI off to Draft one of its own, leaving the World I’m after out of the AI’s range of attack. I can then Deploy my units. The AI will Invade a different World if there is one in range. I can then move and Invade the World I want.

It’s decisions like that you’ll be making every round. Also, I like how I can play both for combat strength and for buying power, and be able to win going with either strategy.  Now, I feel like I should say something negative for balance...there are times, playing this variant, that you'll need to make sub-optimal moves against your strategy solely so the AI doesn't acquire a really strong card.  But maybe that's playing optimally in the long run anyway.

Great game. Great art. Great gameplay. Great solo variant. It’s a win all around.

If you're interested in trying it, be sure to check out [b]Ava[/b]'s Player Aid and videos.  Super helpful for solo players new to the variant:

RATING: 7
basically default 7 rating. Does not quite scratch that itch for me. My son, however, loves it, which is of course why I got it.

Core Worlds combines several elements in an interesting way, but avoids investing heavily in any of them. It's kindof deckbuildy, yeah, but not too much - there's almost no opportunity to remove cards from your deck, or to increase the speed with which you can cycle your deck. You do learn quickly not to waste actions and space drafting cards that don't have synergy with the rest of your deck. There are distinct factions, but [i]just barely[/i] - the game could go further with that, as in [gameid=21241] or [gameid=58281]. There are different directions in which you can build your deck - emphasizing starfighters vs. infantry, but those are essentially interchangeable; they don't represent different [i]styles[/i] of play. I'm aware that I am complaining about what Core Worlds is [i]not[/i] rather than enjoying what it is, so allow me to take that to the extreme and add that other games that this is not include [gameid=36218] and [gameid=28143].

Also, I suspect that some of the "good stuff" has been deliberately left out in anticipation of an expansion. That doesn't quite sit right with me, but I'll probably be buying it anyway.

Always wanted a quick, lighter yet meaningful space themed card game.
There is Race for the Galaxy, but it is too icon heavy, borrows too heavily from San Juan role mechanics (i.e. explore deck, trade/produce...), and I prefer San Juan.
There is Eminent Domain.  But most of the cards you handle don't evoke a feeling of the space theme.  Also borrows from San Juan role selection, so I prefer San Juan.  I don't mind the role selection mechanic so much with the aforementioned games, but it felt too identical compared to San Juan.  Would have liked to see some different roles.

Then there is Core Worlds.  Alright, now that's what I'm talking about.  Just about every card's artwork draws me into the space theme.  It doesn't feel like it's riding on the exact same mechanics as other games.  I'm NOT constantly shuffling my cards.  Straight forward rules, not 50 icons to figure out, plays great and most importantly is FUN!

Thank you!  Everything I was looking for.  Can't wait for some expansions!!!

7/28/13 Update:
Finally got a chance to play a FULL game with the Galactic Orders expansion. I LIKE it, makes for a fuller richer gaming experience.  The only downside to this game for me is the time it takes to play (3 hours for 3 people).  I'm sure we could get it down to 2 hours with more plays, which would be just right.  But it just takes time to read the text on the cards in the Central Zone, and evaluate which is best to draft, as well as what is the most efficient way to attack a world.  Still, I'm looking forward to future plays.

It took three plays to get into this, but the adoption of the draft mechanic and a better knowledge of the cards really saved it, and third time through it was suddenly much more involving.

We may have expected more action from all the references to this as a "deckbuilder", but it is much less free than that description would indicate and requires careful management of resources and, critically, a sense of direction from the very start, at which point you may begin to plan your game.

Cross between a deckbuilder and CCG-like "summon your monsters to attack", but against targets instead of eachother.

Very nice artwork, and a fun theme of Asimov's Foundation series.

Only downside to this game I find, is that the last round is the game grinds to a halt with the last round where everyone tries to optimize their scoring. Not sure how to circumvent this, since so many points can get scored here.

Easily the most aggressive feeling deck builder I have played to date.  I played this with the Galactic Orders expansion and I have to say I think the game would not have been as well received if I had played it by itself, but it would've still gotten a solid score.

RATING: 6.5
In this space themed deck building game, one uses their actions and energy to play down cards. Cards typically have a fleet and ground strength. Players can then use their cards to invade planets which require a certain fleet and ground values to conquer, which give more energy and VPs. As another action, players can also draft cards from the middle. 
As the game progresses, the cards get more powerful and planets are harder to conquer, but have more rewards. 

The one thing that does bug me a little bit is the way turn order works. In the last 2 rounds, you want to go first or second to have a chance at the good cards (the "core worlds" which give many VPs), and if you don't get first crack at them, you could be at a disadvantage. So by the last rounds, the turn order may not be in your favor. 

The game is going to clcock in at around 2 hrs, probably just a bit long for a deck building game, but it is okay to play. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
I don't understand why there needs to be a deckbuilding mechanic if there are only ten turns in the game.  Deploying units to a warzone seems like an interesting mechanic, but it exacerbates the problem of opponents taking the card you wanted out of the pool before you can get to it.  Resource system (managing actions and energy) is needlessly complicated.  I do like how the semi-simultaneous turn-taking helps to cut down on downtime, though.

From what I heard about Core Worlds I was disappointed when I actually played the game. The ability to garrison units on newly conquered worlds as a way to get obsolete cards out of one's deck I thought also indicated that the game would have player vs. player combat. It does not. It is like every other deckbuilding game I've played: A foot race for points with little-to-no player interaction. *Yawn*

As the game continues, turns are bogged down more and more as players need to do progressively more complex math to see if they are able to invade worlds.

This game was just too simple I think. I played a two player game of it and didn't feel very much interaction at all, even less than many games of Dominion. I thought the cards and player aid boards weren't the greatest quality, especially compared to Stronghold's other games, and overall I just felt disapointed with this one. I'll play it again, but now I won't be buying it.

A deckbuilder with some tableau building elements. As a deckbuilder it's not too unique, but there are extra elements which compensate: the tableau building is a nice touch, there's some resource-gathering, and the Innovation-style power creep also provides a satisfying narrative arc.

There is a lot of information to process on the first play, which can induce AP; we took 3.5 hours. I'd like to play again.

I didn't like Eminent Domain at all, and I was scared about Core Worlds. The graphic design is not really inviting, I had read the rules, and they were nothing spectacular...

But the rules are deceptive, and Core Worlds is more different than ED than it seems. In ED, the cards you get dealt choose for you most of the times. In CW, you are presented with meaty decisions every round, several times. And those are decisions that will have repercusions. I has a short term strong tactic component and also a long term strategic component. The more the game progresses, the more deep it gets.

There's not, perhaps, very much space for differentiation (in points, because cards will be very different) between players, and there's a very nice catch-up mechanism, not powerful enough to make you prefer not to go first, but still very useful. I mean the tactic cards that give you energy during the energy phase. that means games are bound to be tight and will probably be decided at the end.

The downside is its lenght, maybe a bit excessive for a deckbuilder. This is because decisions are not easy. Also, AP prone players may be an issue here.

The cards have quite a few text, and it's difficult for new players to get a hang about what your rivals are doing and, most important, what they can do before your next turn.

Probably my favorite deck builder at the moment. Can't get it to the table as much as I would like, but I really enjoy the way that this game approaches deck building. 

Played it twice with just the base game, and will never play it with only the base again.  The expansion adds just a few more rules, but it makes the game so much better.  Great game, expansion puts it on a whole new level though.

Nice cards and a decent game, but very, very long. Surprisingly little variation in end scores between players, regardless of time wasted on calculating optimal moves.

Excessively oversized box, in a non-standard size.

Core Worlds is a 2-5 player deck drafting game with a space conquest theme, and it is excellent. The art is particularly good, reminiscent of classic cover art from illustrators such as Peter Elson and Tom Stimpson. After one or two rounds players learn the game and turns trip along. Core Worlds plays quickly, with the focus on deck-building and timing of actions.

The players are ostensibly the rulers of rogue "barbarian worlds" on the fringes of a corrupt and decaying interstellar empire. In much the same way that the young lords in Dominion all decide to better themselves at the same time, the despots of Core Worlds simultaneously attempt to conquer the galaxy. There is no direct player conflict, nor is there the action selection mechanism such as in Glory to Rome. Instead, there is intense competition to gather resources (and invade planets) before the other players do.

Players start with basic decks and a single home planet. Planets generate "energy", which is used to draft cards, deploy them, and pay for actions. There are ten rounds in the game: each round a set of cards is available in of the table, and players draw a hand of six from their personal deck. The trick is to draft and capture cads from the central area before the other players. This may be indirect competition, but it is fierce.

There is already an expansion in the works, and I am looking forward to it.

Holy mathy, AP-induction. It's a somewhat dry deck builder that I think I want to like more than I actually do. I do like that there's built-in deck thinning (that occurs organically, without having to get a luck of the draw card from the market). I also like that you get to shuffle your new cards into your deck right before endgame.

I think deck builders need to use some of these concepts, and some others, to help you cycle through your decks faster, while somehow preventing runaway power inflation.

It must be mentioned that the expansion contains content that belongs in the base game.

Reading the rule book was rather daunting, but a practice game relieved some of my anxiety.  This game is complex, but not outrageously so for those who have played Dominion and/or Race for the Galaxy.  Nevertheless, there's a lot to think about and keep track of, so I will need to play many more times before I really get the hang of it.  The components are sturdy and the art work attractive, but I didn't like the way that the same symbol in the same location was used to indicate the energy generated on world cards and the energy cost for use on others.  (4+4)

Sort of an ok ish game.  Nothing special. Actual artwork is nice, but the graphic design of the cards is pretty amateur.

The biggest shock is this has just come out and I have seen the RRP.  £45.  That is very bad.  This is a card game with a couple of extra bits, and it isnt a great card game at that.  Absolutely nowhere near worth anything near that. Should be half this price.

Deckbuilding. You start with a set number of actions each turn and energy equal to the worlds you've conquered so far. From your hand of 6, you deploy your ship and infantry cards, spending an action for each card plus the energy denoted by the cards. The more powerful each card (eg the more infantry a card is worth), the more energy it costs. You then spend another action to conquer a world in the middle. Worlds provide energy in future plus VPs. The more energy it provides, the more ships and infantry you'll need. So you also spend actions drafting even better cards (which will use the same 1 action to deploy, but provide more oomph). So the tradeoff throughout the game is when to buy more energy versus when to buy more troops for later bigger worlds and the saving of future actions. Any cards deployed but not used for conquering hang around to next turn (hoping for better choice). There's 10 rounds and the cards in the middle for buying (refreshed between rounds) get more powerful every 2 rounds (ie there's 5 Innovation style decks to draw from). The game worked fine. There are other decisions to make in terms of do I take cards with no special powers for more points/power, or take cards with special powers I can use, so then you work towards combinations. The last deck has Puerto Rico style bonus buildings which require lots of oomph but deliver lots of victory points, so you aim towards buying one or two of these, tailoring your purchases along the way towards maximising those bonus VPs (eg +1VP per ship in your deck). Like most deckbuilders, you want to trim your deck early (cards buying worlds can "settle" those worlds and disappear from your deck, meaning your new more powerful cards will come out more often). The game lasts the right amount of time. It seems pretty standard for the genre but is done well and worth exploring.

Good, fun game, though I must say that this is the heaviest and longest card game I've ever played. It reminds me of a cross between Dominion, 7 Wonders, and San Juan minus the Role Selection. 

I think this game is wrongly compared to Eminent Domain; I enjoy them both and think the two games feel different enough for me.

I want to play this with 2 players before I rate this.

What I like:
- Cool theme, good art and components
- Almost the only interaction is grabbing cards first
- Air/ground system works well
- Probably quick with 3 people who know the game
- Has a lot of strategy as well as tactics

What I don't like:
- It's a game of timing and rhythm, which I don't tend to like
- You have to plan about 1.5 rounds in advance, but the random card draws mess with your plans
- More special abilities than I prefer
- Turn order can kill you
- 5p learning game took 2.5 hours, not counting setup/rules

Definitely a game where you'll need to play it a couple times to know what cards come out and how to plan for them. And what combos are possible to take advantage of those. And how to time your drafting/deploying/invading within and across rounds.

I agree with the advice to keep learning games to 3p. Weight of 2.8 seems about right. My rating reflects how much I think I would like the game if I were to play a few more times to learn the cards. (Which I don't actually plan to do).

It's bland, weak, predictable. Played twice and no interest for more. There are better and worse deckbuilders. (Trains is better, arctic scavengers is worse) Not a lot of strategy. It's very light, easy decisions, yet can get mathy in end rounds and resulting Ap drags the game out. Would not play with more than two. Early turns are similar as every faction has the same cards, except for one special hero, which doesnt make a huge difference. The last two rounds are anticlimatic and too predictable as all cards come out, same every game, and you take turns grabbing all the prestige planets. Zero strategy there. If you are first in turn, grab the best prestige planet, or grab the next best. They are way too easy to grab at this point as you have many core worlds by end game. Tedious. 

The mid game is best, the end rounds boring. You can draft cards but you are lucky to see them twice during the game. there is variety in what cards come out each round, so you won't see all cards every game, but the scoring/combo methods are not that high or varied. Trains is a much better deck builder, and much more fun. 

I considered buying the expansion but I don't think it will save the game, only drag it out more, and the base game is already too long as it is. This is highly overrated. I enjoyed star realms more, and I didn't really like that game very much.

2/19/12 - I am so happy with the next generation of card driven games and Core Worlds is a great example. The level of complexity is steps above Dominion and the market is better than Ascension because you add and remove cards to keep the market fresh.

The game is comes with separate cards to draft before the game and customize the deck even further. The designer even thought ahead and has symbols setup for the possibility of expansions. Core Worlds is a great game for fans of deck building or card driven games.

This game is longer than I prefer, and I don't get excited about invading alien worlds as a theme. On the other hand, it was not at all a bad game.

This deck-building game is a like a strategic and thoughtful version of Ascension.  Like Ascension, cards are drafted from the middle instead of bought from common piles.  However, this isn't a simple affair of dump your hand, see what you can grab, and move on.  In Core Worlds, you have to spend your limited energy to deploy stuff from your hand, and then use that stuff (which goes to discard) to conquer planets that are available, which give you more energy for later.  Alternatively, you can spend energy to draft new equipment into your discard.  Excelling in this game requires careful management of your energy, the number of action you have, and keeping a close eye on what your opponents can and can't do.  The game features a lot of planning and strategy that isn't the norm in today's selection of deck-builders.

A lot more fun than I thought it would be, but still short by a bit to becoming great. 

Each turn players divide up their time between recruiting troops, deploying troops, and attacking worlds (with their troops). The theme really could have been anything, but I'm glad they picked the ones they did. The cards and planets mostly have cool names, which sounds like an odd thing to appreciate but appreciate it I do. 

Multiplayer solitaire-ish, which is the worst thing about the game, as the only interaction is taking something before someone else can take it. 

Runaway leader seems like it could potentially be a problem, but I don't think the game lasts enough rounds to make a huge impact.

RATING: 8
Kind of a fusion between Race for the galaxy and Dominion or Ascension. I think you can own this game and Race for the galaxy without them feeling redundant. 

A good game so far. My wife doesn't typically enjoy deck building (She really didn't care for Dominion sadly) or Race for the galaxy (thinks it was too hard to grasp how to play well), but she at least tolerates this game which is quite an improvement. If it were co-op she would probably like it a lot more.

The game is multilayer solitaire so be warned. Player interaction is quite low. Unlike Race for the galaxy there is a set number of rounds and the game ends on the 10th round for everyone. The player with the most accumulated victory points wins.

With the expansion the game feels complete. I'm in the camp that the expansion for this game is a must buy.

Core Worlds generates a narrative or story slightly more than Race for the galaxy does. It definitely has better art. It's an appealing concept art style that stirs the imagination and gives a consistent look and feel (great art direction there). 

I'm not sure if game play is as good as Race for the Galaxy, but more plays are needed.

For now I'd give this an 8 or 8.5 could go up to a 9. My wife would probably give this a 6 or 7. It's not really her kind of game, but it's better to her than other similar options.

Edit: I don't feel this is a 9. I'd choose to play Race for the galaxy, Dominion, and Thunderstone over this game. I think core worlds with it's expansion is a solid 8, though I can see some potential for it to slip to a 7. My wife puts it at a 5 or 6 she tolerates it. I must reiterate though, I find the art in this game fantastic and appealing. 

The game isn't a race, but a multi-player solitaire victory point optimization contest. Lack of interaction hurts the game some, but the process of trying to get the most out of your current turn while planning ahead for future ones is enjoyable. A bit like Agricola I suppose. I guess core worlds is like a simpler Race for the Galaxy and Agricola. I think Core Worlds doesn't pull it off as nicely as those games, but core worlds can play in about an hour and is more accessible.

Deck builder where new cards become available every round, after every two rounds, you switch to a better deck (for a total of 10 rounds). You can build your army, conquer planets or buy more units to strengthen your army. We had fun, even though we missed a few details (you can get rid of one of your basic units when conquering a world; there's always at least x worlds and at least x other cards, where x is the number of players; all cards from the last supply deck are available for buying/conquering).

This is definitely one of my favorite deck-builders. It has a heavy resource-management component which complements the deck-building aspect of the game very nicely. There are many options to try, and tons of choices on every turn. This can lead to the game going a little long. I think I like it best with 2 or 3 players, and probably won't play with 5. 

With the expansion, which adds just a small element but opens up new strategies, I would bump the rating to a solid 8.

RATING: 4
The card art is nice, but it takes up less than half the space on the card, which diminishes the epic feel of this space exploration/conquering deck-building game. Additionally, I understand the designer's rationale of using white for the card edges, but again, it diminishes the already low graphic value of the game. You guys could've, at least, inserted fluff text on the World cards which had NOTHING in their text boxes. I bloody HATE empty text boxes with a passion! 

I'm not a fan of only being able to do a single Draft per turn. I've yet to decide on the 10-turn mechanic, interesting as it plays out. It does make the game feel like your exploring, building and acquiring resources towards encountering and conquering the Core Worlds. I hope a future expansion will allow players to interact (i.e. attack or defend or trade) with other players, because this game is neither a duel or co-op; its essentially a race - a sloooooow race characterised by downtime in decision-making.

Edit after playing a couple 2-player games, and lots of solo plays. 

I can't play this game with the standard rules, at least in solo play. Solo house rules I'm using;
1) 3 turns per sector for the first 4 sectors
2) Core sector duration: until your deck runs out
3) Spend 5 energy to buy one action
4) No draft per turn limitation (hardly makes a difference)
5) aim of the game is to acquire as many Core Sector cards as possible before the deck runs out.
6) Don't play for Empire Points, but Core sector card count instead.


Even with heavy modifications for solo play, Core Worlds STILL feels like its competing for watching drying paint as a stimulating and time-well-worth-spending activity. It just feels way too constrictive, what with having to contend with limited turns, limited Energy, competing options. The 10 turn mechanic frustrates the potential for a fun, scenic romp through the galaxy, settling and conquering and acquiring stuff along the way towards a common destination and instead gravitates towards gameplay which simulates an overprotective mother incessantly tugging a leash tethered to a hyperactive, undisciplined, bed-wetting, mouthbreathing infant brat. I'm sorry, Mr. Andrew Parks, I'm here to play a game (since I love sci-fi themes), as opposed to not to be treated like I'm a member of Occupy and thusly take numerous beatings around the head by a judicial truncheon. Since I'm clearly digressing from my point, I'll just get to the point; Core Worlds doesn't feel like a game. The name of this erroneously titled "game" is at least, half correct; gameplay and concepts are abstracted and sandblasted down to the CORE so much to be too abstract and generic (snub fights, yawn... galactic grunts, yawn). As for the WORLDS part? Sod off. I get little sense of scope or adventure when turn progression is forced the way it is. And in any case, why would I have a sense of wonder about the worlds I didn't get to visit and conquer when so many world cards have BLANK TEXT BOXES and RE-COLOURED CIRCLES which are supposed to represent the "worlds"?

TL;DR - Move along, nothing to see here.

When I saw the Dicetower video review of this game, I thought, yet another deck building game, I don't need to own this. But as I won it with the BGG-contest, I owned it anyway :). 

After 1 play I must say it surprised me in a positive way. Energy & actions are really tight, which requires carefull planning. There is however no real interaction in this game, except that they can buy the card you were going for from the Central Zone. It's also hard to get an idea of who is winning, so even if you have a Tactics that can give minus -1 energy to another player, who to pick?

This is quite probably one of the best deck building games (that builds on the gaming system idea developed in Dominion). Unique in that it adds as combat style element. Play certainly builds towards a climax, which is nice. A step up, and in the right direction, from Dominion (and the other deck building games). I think the expansion is probably necessary

Enthusiasm has faded a little on the game since I discovered "The Strategy" (early deploy, thin deck, draft units and conquer worlds later). I think it needs more development, but has fantastic potential. I really love the concept, the art, and the way the deckbuilding is used as a tool to build you empire rather than as an end in itself. The game needs an expansion, though.

This is a deckbuilding game where everyone gets a nearly symmetrical set of cards, and players take turns either buying cards from a central area of available cards, or spending their cards to conquer planets. Planets sit in front of you and generate money you can spend each turn, or in some cases they give you endgame points. To take a planet, you just need to play cards that meet or beat the defense, in both mans and planes. We played this two player, using both expansions and the promos. We didn't do the round 0 cards, nor did we use the events, but we did everything else. I liked the game a lot, but for my opponent this game flagged his analysis paralysis really badly. Especially towards the end. We also took up a TON of table space. I'm not sure how this would play with more players. I am interested to try this again, but it didn't knock my socks off.

Brilliant game with atmosphere in spades in both the art and the theme. You are in command of a fledgling space empire. Many different ways to customize your playing experience via the large variety of units, and each time it's just as fun as the last session, there is a very high re-playability present. This is the kind of game where it is fun just to play it regardless of winning or losing. All of this combined with traditional Euro mechanics makes this game a clear winner.

This is probably my favorite deck-building game, although it sometimes doesn't feel like one.  The combination of buying and conquering means that not nearly as many cards go into your deck as most games of this kind.  That said, I really love the difficult decisions you have to make through out the game.

The only real problem I have with it is that it almost always takes longer than I expect it to, and around round 8 or so I'm sort of tired of it.  At the same time, I also wish it was longer so that I could build out my deck more fully or at least complete my themes more.

Like [i]Nightfall[/i], this is more of a game where deck-building is just one element.  In fact, you may only add half-a-dozen new cards to your deck throughout the game.  I like this - I think Andrew Parks is an under-rated designer.  He clearly puts a lot into balance and gameplay considerations.  It's more interesting (more choices) than a lot of other deck-building games and rewards planning ahead and maximising your actions.  In this way, it's something of a thematic brain-burner.

Includes 'Galactic Orders' & 'Revolution' expansions, 'Stronghold' promo, the alternative leader cards and the Core Worlds and Dice Tower promo cards.

Received (with Galactic Orders expansion) for Thunderstone (and all expansions) as part of the 1/4/15 U.S. only math trade.  It is a great game (particularly when using the expansions (especially the first)), but it is very long and has the potential to be very AP inducing.

The deck-building option of the 4X genre (such as TI3, Eclipse etc), but without some typical aspects of the later, like direct confrontation and diplomacy. Think of it as "Dominion in Space". Drags on a little.

RATING: 8
It's a little bit surprising that both this game and Eminent Domain were released around the same time. They are very similar games, with Core Worlds being the heavier of the two. This ultimately has a lot tougher choices and more interesting variety in cards. At first glance, Core Worlds can seem very cluttered, but after a couple rounds everything will fall into place. Overall- I would play either game, but if I had more time I would take Core Worlds.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An interesting game in the deck-builder category. The pivotal difference between this and most other deck-builders I've seen is that you can accumulate an attack force over several turns without impacting your hand limit or the rate at which you can churn through your deck; and a built-in mechanism makes it easy to keep your deck thinned down to the really good cards. The Dominion dynamic of balancing useful cards against scoring cards is missing, and of having to work hard to keep your deck lean and mean. (Other interesting decisions replace those: this is a difference, not a weakness in Core Worlds.)

It reminds me most of a combination of Eminent Domain and Thunderstone, but feels more like Thunderstone because the decisions in Eminent Domain are very different.

Game strengths

1. Plenty of tough decisions to make - which is a good thing.
2. Interesting force compositions are possible.
3. Low level of chaos - most chaos occurs in card draw phase.
4. Nice components.

Challenging aspects to the game - not really cons - they actually make the game more competitive.

1. A bad hand is possible and could set you back.
2. At times difficult to set up an invasion.
3. Hard to know which player is leading.

RATING: 5
I thought that I was really going to like this game but there was nothing there during my game plays. The main problem that I have is that it is a deck builder but you really do not get to play the cards that you buy but maybe a few times for the early ones and if you are lucky 2 times for the cards closer to the end game that you get.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
One of the best card games I have played. Don't be afraid of "the deckbuilding" because it has a much different feel than some of the most popular deck building games(Dominion or Thunderstone) and you really don't have to suffle that often.

The theme really makes sense here and I think mechanisms are well integraded with the theme. Possibility to save a card at the of the round is a huge thing. You have to balance between invading new worlds and getting better units&tactics since other players might take what you need just right now. I think there is a lot room strategy and energy&action point system makes a lot tough decision to be made during the game. Sequencing the purchase of cards and invading new planets should be also made carefully; you really want to get those newly purchased cards in your deck at the right time.

Good thing that there is an expansion that will guanrantee that the game will have more legs in the future.

edit.The game is hugely better with expansions and they fix many slighly problematic things with the base game.

I expect Essen to work like American TV. As I don't actually attend myself I assume people who do will pick out their favourites and what ultimately reaches local clubs will be the 'good stuff' with all the dross weeded out. It hasn't worked this year. This is the fifth game that has underwhelmed me. Its better than the others in that if felt like the designers were trying but the result has serious problems.
The game feels like the trendy deck building concept was tacked on to it. The tiny little ineracting card text is way too much to take in on your first play or two so the game really drags. This makes your first plays of it a pretty limited experience. Even if you put in enough plays to get to grips with the game you would have closed the door for new players, because even one slow player at the table leaves everyone else sitting around with masses of downtime.
Not a bad game perhaps but not one that will be given the chance to be a good game by most players.

March 2013 - I would recommend buying the expansion with the base game.  You know how some games which are good become broken with a poorly designed add-on, well this is the opposite.  Seriously, buy the two together and have fun.
This is my first deck building mechanic game which having learnt, made the experience enjoyable.

RATING: 6
A game I had high hopes for but which didn't live up to expectations. Admittedly I never got round to trying the pre-game draft which would provide some variety to the starting decks - I imagine this would improve the game somewhat, but I don't see it fixing my biggest issues. The main problem I found was that most of the Core Worlds themselves reward having certain types of card in one's deck, but that there are too few of these types (at least in a 2- or 3-player game, which are the only player counts I got to try) to be able to try to build a deck in this way. Add the rather arithmetical way that planets are conquered (or not), and you have a game that, for me, failed to deliver on its undoubted promise.

While I'd have been happy to give it a few more goes, I never felt any enthusiasm for it, and neither did my wife - so, having not played it between 2012 and 2015, we sold it.

a neat innovation on deck builders

by having you play cards to a tableau and later discard them for their effect, the game simultaneously addresses the deck builder issues surrounding trashing and random draw-clumping all in one clean rule.

update:  my main criticism is that the game takes a bit too long.  The early game goes at a good clip, but it can start to drag by the end.  I still enjoy it, but it does bound the awesomeness.

12-02-2014. Played it 3 times. I like the game, its a novel take on deck building that actually changes more and not only pastes on a theme like Thunderstone. Instead of having all decks available at all times, you build 1 deck per two rounds of the game, of which just one part is turned open each 2 turns.

Just like Thunderstone, there are kind of 3 currencies. Planets provide income to buy with, Fleet and Ground strength can be increased by buying cards to attacking planets of that often combined fleet/ground cost. 

For me, considerable downsides are the lengthy playtime, all games I played took 2+ hours. Also, the different cards contain much text and take time to read which makes the game AP prone. 

Don't get me wrong, there is much to like, unfortunately for me it's just bogs down so much that I do not enjoy the game as much as I hoped. Admittedly, I didn't play the game enough to become an expert in the game which might bring downtime down if you play with the same group sufficient times. Unfortunately, that doesn't happen to me often and the game so far hasn't invited me to invest in it. Imho, the expansion further convolutes the game for theme. Really didn't like Galactic Orders expansion for that reason.

If the game could be stream-lined, that would be a HUGE bonus for me.

A very fun slow-burning deck-builder. The futuristic interstellar war theme works very well and lends itself perfectly to the mechanics. As cards become less useful you get rid of them one at a time, which is a nice change of pace from other games of its type. If I didn't already own so many deck-building games, I'd definitely buy this one.

This game is a good game. I did a lot of research before I bought this game. 
I really like the game myself but I think this is purely a gamers game. I doubt that I will be able to get many non gamers to play this and that is an important part of owning a game for me. I say its a gamers game because to be good at it one would have to play many times and know the text on the cards.

Card art is awesome

Solid, interesting deck-builder. One of the true second-generation in which building a deck is no-longer the main focus of the game, but rather a mechanism used to great effect.

RATING: 7
Was longer or more fiddly than I would have liked.  The set up of the game makes it difficult to calculate how much energy you need for different things and so you have to do a lot of thinking up front which really slows the game down.  It is not bad but could have been better.  Reminds me a little of mage knight but where mage knight lets you do all your turn at once here you have to plan several moves in advance.

I liked it but it could have been really good with some tweaking I think.

Played with letting you do the home world ability on your turn and it speed things up quite a bit.

RATING: 7
Very simple, minimalistic deck building game with a great theme for the sci-fi fans. It's your standard building of a card empire, the worlds you possess bringing in energy for purchases and actions, and the other cards being the military units and tactics cards. There's a fixed ten turns with the deck divided into five levels of increasing usefulness, then mainly victory points in the final two rounds.

The rules recommend only experienced players play the game with five and that's a good tip. Even a first outing with four is going to take its time as players learn the system and cards. I can see the game feeling a bit the same after a few plays, but it's a good enough game for me to check out the expansion, and that's saying something about how I like it because I'm not really a fan of expansions.

Excellent quality cards that should last and last without sleeving. The artwork is rather basic, but varied. The box is a tragedy - way too big for 210 cards, five small player boards, rules and a handful of small tokens.Something half the size would have been my preference. (In comparison, Pax Porfiriana has about the same volume of components and is about an eighth of the size.)

A good game you can dive into quickly. Hard to justify it in my collection due to the unreasonable box size, but I might just throw out the box and keep the game.

Won signed copy from Jack Vasel Memorial Foundation auction

8.5 based on my limited plays 2 player so far.  It feels completely different than any other deck builder Ive played so far.  I like the long term planning aspect of it, even though you can be hamstrung by card availability at times.  Still, even if your plans dont work out perfectly, there is generally something pretty cool you can buy anyway.  Has a bit of a euro feel where you can't quite do everything you want to do on a turn which can make gameplay a little agonizing at times, but I like that in my games (like agricola)

Update - love it, 9.5  Hard to get to the table though, my wife sees anything sci-fi and just refuses to play...so sad.
4/14 Update - Dropped to 8.75 - I just haven't played this recently.  The main gaming partner (wife) just has no interest in learning...I need to force her somehow soon!
8/15 - still dropping: 8.25.  Still not getting this to the table...I can't see getting rid of it, but I'm super sad no one wants to play...

Slow-paced deckbuilder that lacks the variability of Dominion.   Players need to plan out all of their turns at the beginning of each of ten rounds.  Those plans are then subjected to player chaos and need to be recalculated each turn. Good production with card text that is easy to read.

A longer, strategic deck management game. Going into a round with a full war zone is beneficial, since you will be able to immediately conquer worlds, rather than deploying units first. Many people suffer from AP due to trying to figure out which units to use to invade a world. This should decrease with experience, but it can be an issue.

The expansion makes the drafting choices more meaningful and opens up the strategic space of the game significantly, but the base game is pretty solid.

My main problem with the game is the action economy, and how that limits the strategy space for the game. There are a couple of cards that can allow strategies revolving around more weaker cards, but there are only 2 of them, and they can only come out in round 5 or 6, at which point it may be too late to get the cards you need to take advantage of them.

Excellent game, can't wait to play the Galactic Order. Unfortunately, as it's usually the case with US designed games, the readability is poor. The game would have benefited a lot from using icons/pictographs instead of lengthy English text. For most cards, the required iconography is fairly obvious, only a few cards really require wording.

Oh well, if I ever have the courage to scan all the game cards, I might come up with proxies using icons.

This game is quite good, but something about it keeps it from hitting the table often. For one thing, it is quite long for a card game. Three hour games in a four player game are no exception. Second, it can get really hard to figure out how to best spent your resources. This actually stalls the game quite a lot. Last but not least, for a deck builder the deck building aspect is not that immersive. I want to like this game, but this this game is good rather than great to be honest.

I didn't know what to expect from Core Worlds.  I have grown tired of deckbuilders, and so I had an initial aversion to this one.  But this doesn't feel as much like a deckbuilders as others do.  There is a splash of Eminent Domain here, but just a tiny splash -- this is a lot more fun to play.  There might be an issue or two at the end as it pertains to turn order and opportunity to get Core planets that you'd like to have, but beyond that, I enjoyed the play and would play again.  Another thing to note is that I won the first time I played, which says a lot about the ability to learn the game as others had played a lot more times than I had.

1 play, 3er (all new).

Eh. At the moment, I'd rather just play 2-player Race.

Need to play it again now that I'm familiar with the mechanics, but just wasn't all that exciting. And since we only saw about half the cards from each sector deck, it seems like it would be very difficult to be able to build the kind of deck you'd like? I do tend to prefer tactical games, though, so maybe this won't be an issue for me....

I suspect repeat play will bump the rating up some.

I love Dominion and am fascinated by deckbuilding games.  I wish there was more variety in themes.  This one, despite the theme, has potential.  I enjoyed my initial play even though I misunderstood a key rule.  It's not close to Dominion for me, but I can see my rating possibly improving upon digging deeper into the worlds.

For right now this hybrid deck/tableau builder shot onto my list of favorite games.  There isn't a huge amount of content or depth so that may change but for right now I'm looking for any opportunity to play it.

The game is pretty easy to teach and can play reasonably quickly although that does slow down a bit with more players and more thinky players looking for the most efficient course of action.  The game is always played in 10 rounds and each round players are drafting cards from a central pool to add to their personal decks, deploying units to their warzone, and using those units to conquer planets in the central pool.  Many of those planets and some units have victory points attached to them and the person with the most at the end of the game wins.

The game has 5 different decks in it, each one is drawn from for two rounds into the central pool and they ramp up in power and price as the game goes on.  The one danger I do see in this design, though I haven't seen it happen yet, is if you don't acquire the necessary cards early in the game to "afford" the higher level cards you can get completely cut out of the game later.  The final round the namesake "Core Worlds" all come out at once and they provide end-game bonuses based on the makeup of the rest of your deck.  The art on these cards is incredible and there are combos and different strategies to build toward (for example, many of the robot units in the game reduce the price/increase the strength of other robot units when they appear in numbers).

Another potential issue, which I haven't played enough to evaluate yet, is that like Race for the Galaxy while there are multiple copies of some cards the majority of the ones you see will be unique which means one player may get them and another won't and this can introduce some balance and luck issues.  One player may have been lucky enough to buy a strong combo while another never sees the second card he needs for his combo for example.

All that said this is a reasonably simple game to teach people that packs quite a wallop of fun.  There's a decent amount of variety out of box, it looks great, and it plays smoothly.  Highly recommended, even for those (like myself) with half a dozen deck-builders already sitting on their shelf.

RATING: 8
Amazing game. Really captures the space theme. I also love it that the scores don't get tallied until the end so you really don't know if you are ahead or behind. I do wish it was a couple of turns longer so that you got a better chance to get out those awesome turn 7 and 8 ships, but the game is perhaps more tense because of the abrupt ending. Card quality is great but the component quality is just ok. Overall, though, the game is a blast.

RATING: 6
quite like the system and art work - however never play with 5 (first game 2 hours). Plus the worlds between decks one and four could have been more interesting, however the lack of variety removes complexity which is suitable for this game.

Time wise much better with 2 though less variety in cards to choose from (45 minutes).

Quite like the decision of when to thicken your deck by placing cards back into discard pile after invading a world, also tension of keeping units in warzone for abilities rather than use them for invasion. There is also a need to plan when to take worlds and when to build up - especially for the last two rounds.

Interaction is limited to draft choices - do i take the world I want? or that juicy cruiser? 

However, for level of complexity and interest its too long for my tastes.

RATING: 8.5
An excellent and intriguing game.  Part deckbuilder, part resource-conversion game, I guess.  Great artwork with a feeling of building your empire, whether you win or lose.

Tends to run a little long with more than three players, so I'm lowering my rating half a point.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Excellent resource management game with an excellent space theme.  Every time I lose it feels like I could have done something better and every time I win I feel like I earned it myself.  There's luck, but the game is in manipulating that luck so what you need is always what you get.

Edit: after this many plays the core game gets fairly rote. The first expansion is good but the second expansion needlessly complicates the game. 

This game also has an enormous table space requirement that gets out of hand.

RATING: 6
I've realized the only reason I'm holding on to this is the artwork. The game is just too long for what I want it to be. 
-------------------------------
I find it so hard to know how I feel about Core Worlds. At times I think I love it but my opinion is definitely dropping.

Core Worlds is resource management for drafting cards to your deck to be used in a tableau to gain victory points.

The artwork is great and the sci-fi them comes through very well. The components are adequate but I have upgraded the player board markers. Card stock is excellent.

Cards become available in limited numbers and are replaced over multiple phases. The cards become better As the phases go on. This leads to a wonderful sense of progression. It also means it is hard to make a viable plan as you may simply not get the cards you need for your plan.

I have won nearly every game I have played. Most of those game I am not sure why I won. Turn order is a big deal in the game. It changes from round to round and bonus resources are given in some player counts to try balance things. In fact, the game has lots of balancing mechanics. Probably too many. They work well, even too well, and some of them don't make any thematic sense. "I can get more energy with this card than you can just because I start with less energy from my planets? Why?"

The expansion feels to just add more things that you may do and more choices without any real addition to the game. More of the same feel that just looks and acts different. I only have 2 plays with the expansion though.

This game strips the parts from many other card games and turns them into something that isn't remotely new but is still interesting and valid in its own right. Its strength is also its weakness - there isn't a lot to it. The game is quick to learn and also easy to play. Where it may suffer is in long term depth, and any expansions will really need to do something new and interesting to keep this fresh.

I really liked this game, but no one in my family would go for it.  I looked into a few of the solo rules here on BGG but didn't find anything that really captured my interest enough to learn how to play with it.  Bummer...one of the better deck builders I have played but it should be with someone who will enjoy it.

I traded it for Race for the Galaxy along with the expansion that comes with solo rules...we'll see how that goes.

I find the game a bit... uninspiring. Its difficult to plan ahead, as you don't really know what will show up. So it's mostly tactics and only limited strategy. And I believe chaos will increase with more players, but that remains to be seen, if I should get to play this again.

Hard time deciding what I think. I kept wanting to like it, but it was mostly just very mathy feeling, trying to add up all the various numbers at the start of the turn. You didn't get to cycle your deck enough to feel like there was much deckbuilding. And an awful lot depended on what cards came up at the right time. Overall a disappointing experience.

RATING: 7
It's early, but I'm rating this one a 9 based on my 2 plays and one GM of the game.  This is a deckbuilder but more importantly, it's a game of arching strategy that has players making constant decisions.  You never stop making decisions in Core Worlds which is why I love it.  You have to carefully balance the timing of your actions along with your resources.

Lots of tension.  Lots of decisions.  

This game is a winner.

The final product is superb.  The artwork and design is fantastic as is the quality of the cards.  I'm a big fan.

The shine really wore off quick.  It's just lacking something to make it awesome.  Not sure what, but probably more player interaction.

Purchased from Time Warp Comics 1/14/12.

This combines a few things I'm not a fan of, namely, action points, deck building and variable card combinations. For people who don't mind those things this should go down very well as the game itself plays smoothly, has simple rules and keeps the pressure on the players throughout to optimize their decks whilst grabbing points at every opportunity.

RATING: 5
Deckbuilding game with 'collect' element to add income to your own tableau.
The most interesting of this game I found the novel way to cull cards from your deck: use them as garrisons on the just conquered worlds.

The game itself though, is clunky, repetitive and plain uninteresting. First, you have two resources: actions and energy and you have to manage both. Especially the action marker I found to be detrimental to the game: it prevented core worlds from having the 'deckbuilding' flow like I experience in Star Realms or Dominion. Second, all you do is repeat the same stuff over and over again, getting feeded stronger cards, stronger worlds with stronger defences but it is all the same. 

Finally, there was not much interaction: only the 'I take this before you do' type of interaction found in any game. This makes the game a pretty uninteresting affair as - other as gazing what your strenghts are - I'm simply not interested in the actions of the other players.

Funny enough, playtested this just after a game of Terraforming Mars and found myself just wanting to play that game again as the theme of this one does just not come through enough for me to warrant multiple plays.

Compared to other games, I found this game has been surpassed on every aspect by so many others:
- Flow: Dominion, Star Realms
- Interaction: Race for the Galaxy, Star Realms, so many others
- Theme: Terraforming Mars
- Card interactions: Thunderstone (epic variant), Innovation, Glory to Rome

Just some examples, but there are many others. Too bad, as it is not a bad game and I see this game being hauled as promising back in the day deckbuilders were fairly new. Nowadays, disappointed and not so interesting anymore.

Perhaps the expansions greatly enhance this game but I won't be shelling out for them with a base game that is just ho-hum. On the trade pile it is.

A deep game and the player has to think for each step, thus 10 turns can take at least 1 hour. Not suitable for new comer to the board game.

The biggest downside is the box design, which really looks STUPID/DUMB. The insert was already dead on arrival. Huge box for what's really inside, at least enough for 10 expansions. The rule book and play mats come as bent.

I cut the left of the mats, and made everything, including the expansion, fit perfectly in the RFtG expansion box.

Agh! Deck buildings games. Let me smoosh my face into the table some more. Tasting the blood and feeling my eyes swell until I can no longer see is the best cure for the overwhelming sense I have that my soul is seeping away.

How much do I dislike deck-builders? On my final three turns this happened: I'm deciding to ready all of the cards in my hand before the final shuffle. I get 2 lousy grunts, the only ones left in my deck after lots of garrisoning. I reshuffle for the final two turns. I'm not planning to invade this turn, but building for the final turn. I have energy to burn (17 total). I draw three tactics cards, leaving me 10 cards remaining in my draw pile. Those are useless to me, so I'll be discarding them. I get my last crummy starter star fighter, my leader (I've not built my deck for him) and the level 2 star fighter. I marshall all of them, thinking that at least all my good cards will be in the next hand. My final hand reveals that, of the three cards still in my draw pile, my 2 'best' cards remain in the pile. The lousy luck costs me a bonus planet in the core, gives me all of my useless cards and none of my good ones. Total points lost because of the order the cards came out: approximately 12.

Also: watching other people count and re-count their strengths, think over which card they want, and ponder over all of the text really doesn't interest me. There just aren't enough agonising decisions for the amount of time I spent watching other people think about what they were going to do.

RATING: 7.8
I have played this a few times now. This game has become more popular with my gaming group over time. CW features a very strong sci-fi theme, which is further enhanced by gorgeous art present on the cards. Come to think of it, the theme is the greatest part of CW and the art can on more than one occasion distract a player, who will focus on looking at the graphics rather than on planning a strategy. It is almost a shame that such beautiful art is not present in a 4x game like Twilight Imperium. 

Don't be fooled, however - this is not a 4x game, but a regular euro-style game, which only uses the deck-building mechanic as a main mechanism for building one's empire (although some changes to have also been made here, because played cards usually stay in one's empire [play area] until used to conquer worlds, unlike in other deckbuilders where a played card is used automatically and discarded after use).

This deck-building mechanism serves the purposes of the game as well as makes sense story-wise. However, the only negative interaction between players comes down to buying cards/conquering worlds from the central zone before your opponents get a chance to do it themselves. Otherwise, there is little to none interaction between the players, so if you are looking for confrontation normally associated with sci-fi strategy games - you won't find it here.  

The other peeve I have with this game is the long play time and the amount of table space required. I thought that the amount of time spent playing this game would decrease once we got to know the cards, however it still takes approx. 2-2,5hrs to play a three player game and over 3-4hrs to play a 4-5 player game. Also when played with a compliment of 5 players, this game requires a very large table due to the space requirements of building one's empire and the amount of cards available in the central zone.

Still, the art present on the cards and the overall feel of the sci-fi theme in this game makes up for the downsides and CW will certainly find it's way to our table on more than one occasion in the future.

Along with Tinners' Trail, it seemed to be my day for realizing what I should do: and not doing it. Should have deployed everything and grab swag at every odd turn. Didn't. My fault: not the game's.

Looks like it may be a decent game, though without a map or ship construction it will never fully engage the 4X theme for me. (Can a non-computer game fully engage 4X after MoO2 and SE5? Probably not.)

Anyway, I'm up for another play, if games I definitely like are not a choice.

Many fawn over this spaced-themed deck builder. It just didn't do it for us. It gives the appearance of being very samey over several plays (the fact that every single core world is available in the last round punctuates this). I've heard the expansion alleviates this, but I'm a firm practitioner of only getting expansions that enhance great games as opposed to ones that fix mediocre ones.

Good! One of my favourite deck-building games. I like the warzone aspect where you can deploy units to be able to build up over multiple rounds, and the fixed turn length. Albeit the timeline can be frustrating because there's so much left that you can't quite manage to pull off! But that's intentional - in this one you can't 'grab 'em all'!
Plays very well, and not quite as quick as some deck-builders because there is extra info to process, and precise calculations to be made, so prone to AP with the wrong crowd.
Looking forward to the expansion.

The deck-building market is becoming increasingly crowded, and most of the new entries have something to recommend them. But even in this crowded field, Core Worlds stands out. It's streamlined and balanced, and unlike some deck-building games, the choices each turn or often excruciatingly, wonderfully difficult. The theme is engaging, as well. Best of all, Core Worlds has that intangible "fun" factor that some of new deck-building games lack. The deck-building field is growing very competitive, but Core Worlds has definitely carved out a solid corner in the arena ... and a spot on my crowded shelves.

RATING: 8
An interesting deck-builder.  The big difference from most deck-builders is that you need to deploy your units before you can use them to take over planets.  Deployed units stay in your play area until you use them.  This gives you a bit more long-term planning ability than other deck-builders.  The downside is that your deck doesn't cycle as much, so cards you buy towards the end of the game may only get played once or not at all.  The theme comes out very well.  Overall, a very enjoyable experience.

RATING: 6.5
Unfortunately, this isn't the future of deckbuilding at all. The very powerful cards of the later sectors come into the game at a point when it is much too late for them to make a deep impact on the game. Considering that there's no way to even thin out your deck, the only chance for them to take effect the way you hope they do is nothing else but pure luck. That is if you shuffled them right into place or not, because otherwise you're going to be stuck with the wussy-cards you started out with and with which you won't be able to win a "flower pot" with - Sorry, don't know how to translate this, but it means you won't stand any chance of succeeding or be able to invade. This means that the limited amount of planets by which you can discard cards from your hand to draw new ones are extremely valuable. You just have to hope, that you'll have the cards on hand to conquer these planets, since otherwise this leads to my next criticism of the game: It shows a tendency towards rich-get-richer symptoms. A symptom I wouldn't have expected to be found in modern boardgames and I could very well have missed out on. 
Absolutely positive however is the artwork. Someone please come up with a game for it!  
---------------------------
Seems like I missed out on a crucial rule ...mh, now I want to play it again

So glad to have this and its expansion in the collection (again). I have cancelled my rating and will come back to rerate the game once I played it with the correct rules. Which I'm very keen to do.

So much better than originally thought, even though it gets quite confusing towards the end. However, having a set number of rounds still hurts the deckbuilding mechanism. Those two aspects weren't meant to merge.

The first couple of games take a long time because you have to read all of the cards, then on every turn you usually have to read through the cards again to see which ones work together the best. After more plays hoping to increase my rating, because it does seem like a good deckbuilder.

Update: More plays did indeed make a difference. Now we don't have to spend as much time reading the cards over and over, and the game is just a blast.

[b]Player Count Verdict: 2-3[/b]
Gameplay wise, the game would probably be better at the higher player counts, but even with 2-3 it takes a huge amount of table space and the play time can be really long. So stick with 2-3 players for practicality.

First a disclosure, I'm one of the play testers/developers of the game and a play tester/game developers for several other games by Andrew Parks' (and Quixotic Games).

That said, I really enjoyed Core Worlds.  The initial testing took place when I wasn't available, so the game was already well along the way to it's finished form when I first saw it.

I really enjoyed Dominion so I was very excited to see what we could do with a deck building game.  

I love the addition of the tableau, as it removed (what I thought was) the worst part of Dominion, getting the wrong cards at the wrong time, and let me make some strategic moves even when I didn't have a good draw.  

The ability to dump Grunts and Snubs, tightening up your deck and making it less likely to get a bad draw is pretty sweet too!

I enjoyed the game so much I spent about $20 printing my own copy of the play-test version.

First Impression:

An interesting deck building game with a space theme.

I particularly liked the drafrting mechanism that adds to replayability in an interesting way. 

On the other hand this same mechanism makes the game more tactical and less strategic, as the type of core worlds that will actually come to play at the last round is unknown. Dominion is still the best deck building game in my opinion, but this one comes closer than other from a refreshing approach plus it has what dominion lacks: a working theme.

Overall I enjoyed the game, and I'm looking forward to play it more.

The accounting and timing required for purchases seemed more tedious than fun, and playing with 5 players made for a too-long game for it's type with too much downtime. Probably much better with 2 or 3, as players late in the turn order get the dregs.

Space opera with deck building game. Simple rules, a lot of choices, a lot of tension. Excellent game. A fresh breath in the deck building genre. There is no fighting between players, but this is a plus (if you want fighting, go and play Eclipse).

This is a deck building space game that feels a lot like Eminent Domain despite the mechanics having important differences.  I like the way that there are effectively three currencies (energy, fleet strength, ground troop strength) and the interplay between them.  Like all deck builders it's a little wonky not knowing the cards on your first play.  This is a genre that is hit or miss for me, and this was a lot of hit.  This game practically begs for an iOS implementation, which I think is where it would shine, although it's a good board game as is.

Interesting mechanical framework, boring mix of cards, disappointing lack of distinct strategic options. In Dominion, cards like Tactician or Trader do wildly different things and fit different strategies. In Core Worlds, you basically just choose how heavy Fleet/Ground you'll go, and the only variance between the cards is fiddly little numeric modifiers. "Get lots of robots/whatever" is even more boring. The cards just don't provide enough variety to give the game richness.

Solid game system with deck building, card drafting and resource management.

The base game is very tight with a very Euro feel - actions and energy are scarce, should you deploy or draft, invade this turn or next?

Galactic Orders then takes it to the next level. It speeds up the game by improving deck thinning, and allows more synergies through the Orders cards.

Lovely game, especially with Galactic Orders!

As far as I am concerned the best deck builder on the market. With over 30 plays of this game It is definitely one of my favorite games in the collections.

I had to rate this highly after playing all the other terrible Dominion clones out there.

This game is so much better than Resident Evil, Quarriors, Nightfall, Tanto Quore, Arctic Scavengers, Eaten by Zombies, Fzzzt! and Puzzle Strike that it needs to rise in the rankings above them.  

There is still a lack of a deck-builder with theme as strong as Thunderstone and gameplay as strong as Dominion.  This is probably the closest that I've seen.

I normally play each new deckbuilder once and then move on, but this one isn't easily solved and leaves me with a curiosity that might actually make me come back for a second game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Rating is with at least the Galactic Orders expansion, which really adds to the gameplay options (and preferably with the second expansion, which while interesting is not as essential).

Core Worlds is such a unique deckbuilder, featuring lots of decisions and strategic choices throughout the play of it (unlike Dominion and its ilk, where the main strategic choices are made when first seeing the random cards available, and then choices during the actual game tends to be more tactical in nature).

The strong theme and wonderfully classic sci-fi setting (crumbling galactic empire, being beset by barbarians from the edges of the galaxy (=the players), who gradually work their way towards the centre to seize the most valuable worlds, the core worlds, of the old empire.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A cross between Race for the Galaxy and Dominion, this game somehow avoids the pitfalls of both.  There's a tableau building aspect to the game, combined with deck building.  The card drafting and the management of actions vs. energy are interesting.  You can't focus too much on one or the other, or you will have an overloaded deck.  The thematic touches are pretty surface-y, a little well-done flavor text would help.  I'm certainly getting a bit tired of deck building (it's now as saturated as worker placement was in 2010), but this was pretty good, considering.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
(after 1 3p game)  A novel twist on the deckbuilding genre where cards are played in front of you and only go away when you use them in battle.  The 8 or 10 (I forget) draw piles (rounds) had some ver powerful cards and it might be worth a peek before your first game so you might have ulterior goals to score these big points.

Provisional rating after one game.  Liked that it was time constrained.  However, both myself and my opponent had to many turns where we had extra energy or actions.  Hopefully this will dissapear with more plays.

I like deck-building games, so that was the main reason I pre-ordered this one.  The problem is that the characteristics that I like about deck-building games are more or less absent here, and it doesn't feel anything like a deck-builder.  The game is more about building up fleets and managing your resources to keep those fleets running, and I guess the game succeeds well enough at that, but it's not really what I was expecting out of it.

The game took a long time (2.5 hours), and there's not a lot to do when it's not your turn.  Reading the cards to see what they do and comparing your own strengths with the defenses of all the planets takes a good part of every turn, so the downtime is high.  I can see why it has its fans, but I don't think I'm one of them.

RATING: 7
It's nice to see someone put together a deck builder that isn't afraid to throw in some board game elements, like non-card based currencies and permanent tableaus. Utilizing those tools makes the game seem a lot heavier than it's deck-building siblings.

The downside is that it also moves a bit slower than it's brethren. The card market can be smallish and limiting some rounds and occasionally you will take a turn in which nothing constructive happens. (It should be noted that the expansions fill things out quite a bit.) But even then, the player's take threaded turns, so there isn't usually time to get bored with things...even when you're stuck.

It's a solid game engine with a solid SPACE! theme to go with it. If you are a fan of either genre, you should really check this out.

I love love love Core Worlds. It's my favourite deck-builder and while its graphic design might look a bit dated, the art is fantastic and the mechanisms driving it are even better.

It's a deck builder that emphasises deck tracking and more importantly, planning, in a way that games in the genre often don't. Activities are segmented over turns as players bring out ships and infantry, paying for them in energy, and then in later turns, use them to claim planets. Players should ensure they keep the eponymous Core Worlds in mind throughout the game and build their deck towards claiming at least one of them for endgame VP.

Interested, but the early buzz isn't as strong as expected (somewhat like Eminent Domain). I'm now leery of both titles (not that I think buzz is the whole measure of anything, but if it's lacking early, it's generally a sign that something is off, considering the selection bias).

Played one game, with sketchy rules, and liked it. Seems like the "deckbuilding with an actual game attached" remarks, while insulting (to other games), aren't that far off the mark.

- Last round can take pretty long and a game can take up to 3 hours.
- You cant go for a focused strategy, need both ground and air force.

Too long, dry, fiddly and unoriginal. It's the same old deck building all over again with a theme pasted up (probably this is true for every DB) . Played in 5 it lasted ages and was immensly slow and at times also frustrating for some of us. Cards are too thin and flexible to be long lived in a game where you should shuffle them often. Art also is uninspired and confusing: the same symbols mean different things on different cards and this creates confusion.
Not the worse DB around of course, but it lacks the rythm and excitation of others.

As far as the deck-building genre goes, this is pretty decent.  It runs long, especially in our group, but has some good strategic, as well as tactical decision possibilities.  there are some problems, especially with new people, since you have to read and understands 50 or more cards during the play -- as opposed to Dominion's reasonable 10 cards.  some of the hero abilities seems a little underpowered.  The theme is pretty good.

RATING: 9.5
Core worlds gives you a galaxy as a playground. You get to draft ships and men and you get to conquer a host of planets. Trying to line up things to your benefit while trying to avoid getting blocked by the other player creates a multi layer strategy approach that really ramps this game up for me. If I had any complaint it's that the base game is a little bit too short. It's a minor complaint though. Playing with 2 players three turns per sector is possible, fixing the length issue and making this my very favorite 2 player game.

I found it a bit too random for its length, especially as we only saw 4 out of 8 Core Worlds, and that just because I invaded one in round 9, hoping that a better one would appear in round 10. Strange deckbuilder, and a very long game. I very much missed having some tokens, or counters to track the various bonuses, and combat totals.

This deck building in this reminds me of Ascension... but with better options to plan.  Adding two tableaus to manage (the growing set of worlds in your empire and the battle zone of cards coming in and out of your deck) and some action points made this feel a lot more like a full sized Euro game that uses a deck building mechanic.  A solid, enjoyable game... and I'm looking forward to what the expansion will bring to the table.

The bland science fiction theme hardly overcomes the fact that the very few "new" mechanics add very little to the tired deck building genre.

This is my favorite deck builder, probably because it's not REALLY a deck builder.  You do build a deck, but this game is more action-point allocation and resource management than true deck builder game.  A very cool and very interesting hybrid.

Only complaint I can see is people who don't understand why there's no player v. player in the game.  The instructions explain the theme, but I could still see some players taking a pass based simply on the inability to directly influence your opponents.

Rating reduced to 8 because the base game is now almost unplayable without the expansion included.  Still a good game, but adding the Galactic Orders material makes it great.

RATING: 9
One of my favourite deck builders. I've found it a bit wonky but will happily play it again. The expansions clutter up the table to the point that if you're not constantly checking the various factions, etc. or whatever special powers a given hero might have, you suddenly find yourself totally hosed. Two of us have been experimenting with various solutions for this, including the use of a lazy susan to put the cards on. Nothing perfect yet, though.

Still undecided on whether this is just "yet another dominion" or if it's worthy of a higher score.

The fact that there's drafting and sequential pools of cards to draft from definitely adds an interesting element.

This is a medium worker placement with a tremendously beautiful theme implemented well. I like the recipe race feeling. It's brain burny in the combination of Agent cards and the important movement of agent pawns on the board. The dice rolling can hamper your plans, but this is tempered by chit pulls (as needed) and tactical use of opportunities and cards. First to a fixed number of missions wins. Quite enjoyable! The only take back is the fiddly of placing cubes after you leave a location - it clutters the board with the only benefit of gaining agent cards. Admittedly without a path to obtain them, the game would bog down. But this cube solution is quite cumbersome.

There's nothing fundamentally busted about the design, but dice allocation is already very shaky ground for games for me. Too many random elements have to line up for you to be able to play tactically, and it becomes a bit of a scavenger hunt. If it were considerably shorter, or you could accumulate powers to manipulate the game more, it might reach 3/5, but it's just unpleasant. Inaction defines the play experience.

Really different from what I expected. Dice Placement game with Set Collection and Pick Up And Deliver mechanics. The theme it's completely irrelevant, and that's sad. Kind of multi-solitaire, because you can bother players but on some vague or unintentioned way. The game is long, code mechanic coud be more thrilling, but it works, has original things and good design.

A good spy game where you can gain intelligence by following the paths of other spies and you need to complete missions by collecting materials and organizing your agents in the right locations in Europe. You can crack ciphers for more goods. It's not the smoothest game ever, but it is pretty decent.

A nice, relatively light game. 
Fairly high in randomness in the setup and missions you get, and low in player interaction, it plays a bit like a simultaneous puzzle with sprinkles of Pandemic. 
The board layout is so-so: the balkans are too crowded for the size of meeple you get, and we felt the colors aren't distinct enough. Also, the components need a really good airing out before you can play indoors, because the cards have a weird chemical smell.

Essentially, a "puzzle" game with a dice (worker) placement mechanic, to gather different components to fulfill contracts. That description may sound rather generic, but the feel of the game is different enough to warrant future exploration.
The art and presentation is fresh and quite enjoyable. 
Perhaps a tad long for what it is. We may play with 5 missions instead of 6.

I love the theme of this game, and it is clearly a labour of love. The game has obviously been lovingly designed and the production is absolutely fantastic, but the combination of certain mechanisms unfortunately resulted in my other half and I really, really hating this game - and it's on a very short list of games that we've had to pack up before finishing.

The game is kind of a mess.  It feels like the designers wanted to stuff as many mechanisms into the game as possible without regard to the quality of game-play.

My biggest complaint is the tacked on extra phase where players place their workers (dice) but then have to go around again to activate said workers (dice).  I don't see how activating workers when placed would have detracted from the game in any way, save for the doubling of game time when played by RAW.

The Code Breaking segment serves only to add time to the game as AP prone players try to derive all possible combinations for the code tiles.  There is surely a more streamlined way to handle this horrible time-sink of a phase.

My final complaint is that the map is an unattractive, claustrophobic, cube-pushing mess.  Many of the cities are very close together, and there are no printed boundaries between cities.  After a few rounds of player movement, it is frequently hard to tell with certainty which cubes are attached to each city.

Say what you will about my review.  I won't be playing this game again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fantastic game.  It is not a brain burner but it definitely can cause some AP since there are lots of ways to complete the missions.  I think the game is really good.  The asymmetrical powers are good too.  I even like how there is a mini-game of code breaking as a phase in the game.  Solid game and I would highly recommend.

In Covert, the aim of the game is to fulfill various goal cards which score you points, with the goals necessitating being in certain places on the map, or having certain resources on hand that can be acquired in a multitude of ways. It's definitely a big puzzle to figure out, as the cards are multi-use, and there are several ways to skin each cat that is thrown your way. Your job is to do the job as efficiently as you can figure out how to do it.

The phase where you get to determine your actions is pretty clever, as players take turns placing dice on various wheels of actions, each with six available spaces numbered 1-6 displayed in a ring. The first person to place a die on an action ring can choose freely which die to play on it, but following actions in a ring must be placed adjacent to another die on that ring. So, if a player places a 3 on the movement action ring, the next player to choose that action must play either a 2 or 4. There's a lot of looking around the table to see if you can block players out of actions, or if someone else can potentially block you, so the order in which you place your dice has a lot of importance in assessing various risks.

Everything in the game is very nice, but the main drawback is the down time. In my experience, players tend to take quite a while on their turns, as there are a lot of pieces of the puzzle to put together. With the multi-use cards and various goals you're working on all at once, one false move can set you back a bit, so it gets very thinky. I usually don't mind some down time, but with 4-players, it gets a little rough, especially since it's a game where everyone is messing with everything; plans you had thought out can be messed up by the time your turn comes around, causing you to have to rethink things again.

There are also some niggling graphic design choices that made it a little harder to play, like lack of iconography on the code cards that allow you to easily see what resource type you have, or a couple of colors on the map looking a bit too similar.

Overall, I enjoy it, but probably would only play with the lower player counts in the future.

Control your network of spies, gather intel, and break codes in Covert, a game of tactical dice placement, set collection, and timing set in Cold War Europe. Players race to complete high risk Missions by deploying their agents and acquiring the necessary equipment, all while keeping an eye on the needs of future missions and the advances of rival agencies.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Decent game of collecting items (gun, lockpicks, watch, etc) in order to fulfill missions. Each player controls 3 agents that they move around Europe in order to acquire the items and also be in particular locations (cities or regions) when claiming missions (worth points). Dice placement determines what actions you do, namely move agents, take missions, fulfill missions and take items. Item cards have 3 uses: as an item, as a ticket to fly an agent to a city (otherwise, movement is adjacent and slow), or one-time use for special ability. 

Side game (somewhat gimmicky-feeling) is deciphering codes to unlock extra items (worth 2 pts at end game, or a particular item to use during the game for a mission).

Toughest choice is when to pass, as the sooner you pass placing your dice, the earlier you get to go in turn order for resolving the actions.

RATING: 10
Because I'm so competitive, I usually prefer cooperative games or real time games that don't send me into analysis paralysis, ensuring I'm making the perfect move every turn. Even though this game is neither of those, it is one of my favorites (maybe even THE favorite). I look forward to playing this game every time. It's a puzzle with a dozen(ish) possible solutions. When one plan gets foiled, there is always another way to get to the same destination (or something equally good). The only time I experience down time in the game is when puzzling out how to change my plan because another player foiled it. There is tension from beginning to end. When do I drop out of the round to make sure I can break that code, or acquire that Agency Card before someone else? Should I stay in the round longer and hope that other players' moves will change things in my favor? How long can I hold out on placing a die in that Action circle? Is he going to place his 4 there, blocking me? Should I place a 2 there so she can't play in that circle?

Having played this with all player counts (2-4), I can honestly say it is VERY enjoyable for me at any player count. I ask to play this game when we have free time. That's unusual. It's not often that I ask my husband to play a game instead of the other way around.

I love everything about this game:
-the artwork
-the dice placement mechanic
-the mini codebreaking game that compliments the rest of the game
-the balance of the mission cards that allows you to pick your strategy (to go for low difficulty - & therefore low scoring - missions & crank out 6 quickly, or go for higher scoring missions & potentially not be the one to trigger the endgame, but still manage to sneak in a victory)
-the rule breaking special abilities, especially the character ones that may lead you down a different strategy path each game
-the push your luck tension during dice placement & resolution
-the triple use cards that get used for the most obvious thing (mission completion) in early games, but get used more creatively in subsequent games
-the secret codes and things to decipher throughout the box, rulebook, & board!!
-(I'll keep thinking because I know there are more!)

Previous to this game, I would have said Agricola was my favorite medium-heavy weight game. Although this game is nothing like Agricola, it has overtaken it for the top spot on my list!

My main issue with the game is the theme isn't in the game.  It doesn't feel like you're playing a spy/espionage type game.  If the theme were tourists trying to complete all the things they wanted to on their trip that would match the game far better. 

It's a fine euro style game.  Very little opportunities to get in each others way.  There is some tension when it comes to players getting a card you wanted or mixing up the code where you're unable to complete your card.

Promising, after one play. Lots of moving parts, Great card design and graphics, although the map and cube / agent  components are a little less attractive. The code cipher is a little swingy, in that it's not unusual for combinations to drop into some player's laps, but I do like this overall mechanic. Need a couple of more games to figure out better play of agent cards and agent movement.

A game that disguises itself as a deduction game but is actually a dice placement game. The theme is well implemented and fits and everything looks great. The gameplay is solid and the rules are not too heavy. 

However the game lacked a challenge for my tastes. It was too easy to achieve everything I wanted to do in a few turns. So a good game, but too light for me.

RATING: 10
My favorite game. 
Disclaimer: I designed Covert. 
I know some people will be expecting a deduction game, or a fighting game, or something like that with a spy theme, but this is a dice placement Euro. Covert is a very puzzley game that is all about timing and combos. There are ways to block players, but more importantly (for me) there are ways to get around being blocked. There are always several ways to get to any goal that you have, and figuring out the optimal way to do everything is why I love this game. 
Simple concepts, a relatively simple ruleset, but deep decisions, and tension from beginning to end. 
Flatline is a close 2nd for all-time favorite game, but for now at least (Oct 2016), this is my favorite game. Playtesting has been over for a long time, but we still pull this out regularly to play just for fun.

I like the theme, artwork, and gameplay. The box art is the best and prettiest cover I have in my collection. It's actually a lot more difficult than I thought. Dice rolling can get you, as a lot of the same numbers on a given roll spells trouble. You will be blocked from placing action dice where you need, whether by yourself or other players. That's where strategy comes into play, as you can block an opponent from performing an action if your dice come up right. Solving codes can be very difficult, and we found that we didn't really use the items on code cards when broken. My wife ended with 8 unused code cards for 16 points at final scoring. Makes more sense to go for the agency cards, since there are more choices and easier to grab. The mission cards are all over the place as well. You've got low scoring cards and several high scoring cards. Kind of like TTR, where a shorter route between two cities is easier to finish for less points than a longer route. The problem is, there is a predetermined end to the game at 6 mission cards. The scores won't even be close if one had drawn all low-scoring cards and others drew higher-scoring. Your best bet is to end the game as soon as possible if you're the unlucky one with the low mission cards. But then again...can you? You may be blocked by the action dice by other players. Definitely has some flaws, but overall, very enjoyable and will definitely get a lot of plays out of this one.

I'm officially calling Covert the "sleeper-hit" of 2016. Serious, under-rated game which is an amazing 2 and 3 player game. Works with 4 but it can run a tad long. 

The game has fallen a bit for me mainly because I wish it was shorter when playing 4 players and an expansion for crying out loud. Seriously Why TF can't games I like get expansions?!? Do I have to stick to Eldritch Horror and T.I.M.E Stories and LCG's??

First play. Quite an attractive presentation, evoking the theme. However, some of the icons are very poorly chosen as they don't match the illustrations. This is a problem as some cards lack icons - presumably this is why the back of the player screen matches up the illustrations to the icons. Covert is more of a thinking game than I expected - it rewards careful planning and there are multiple ways to achieve a given goal. The code-breaking aspect is novel but doesn't fit particularly well with the rest of the mechanics. The chance factor might be on the high side for a game of this nature and I wonder if the characters are balanced.

Covert is a rather heavy game- bring your working memory.   Play is cerebral and somewhat tense, well-suited to the game's fun and well-implemented theme. The multi-purpose cards and the rather convoluted rules guiding turn order may make the game seem more complex than it really is. Covert is, at its base, a set collection race. Production values are high- the graphics in particular, are inspired.  Terrific at 2p- I agree with other raters here that Covert runs long with higher player counts.

With lots of choices to be made and many ways of accomplishing goals, your noggin' will need to be engaged the whole time. Works very well as a two player game. Eager to try this with 3, and can't wait to play again!

Very happily surprised by this game. It is much more thinky that I had expected. Because you can do your actions in any order, it gives you a lot to think about. You can set yourself up early in your turn to complete missions later in your turn. Of course, others may foil your plans, so trying to be the first to get your specific action and/or predicting what others will do is a big part of the game play. Really enjoyed it!

A big brain burner, to the extent that it starts to feel a bit like a mathematical exercise as there is just so much to try coordinate in any given turn. Especially at the beginning of the game it feels a bit directionless as you don't really know what you should be doing, and you almost feel under pressure that you won't do the "right" thing. Prone to AP, although I would like to try it at a higher player count before deciding to trade it away or not.

This is just a really cool game that carries the secret agent theme well; particularly with the codebreaking aspect. Expect the first game to take longer than the advertised 45-90 minutes, but it's enjoyable the whole way. This is one of those games that has just the right balance of enough choices to make it interesting vs. too many that it's overwhelming. Kane Klenko is becoming one of my favorite designers.

From the same designer of Dead Men Tell No Tales. I really like the design of Dead Men, but I'm not big on pirates at all. I really like the spy theme mixed with dice worker placement that this one will have, so I'm just keeping an eye out on this.

Dry, straightforward, perfunctory euro with little inspiration or inventiveness. The cypher mechanic was the closest thing to a fresh idea, yet is still remarkably dull.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

This is an interesting set collection game where you use dice to manipulate where your agents are located, what items are acquired to assist with spycraft, and complete missions. There is some potential nastiness in dice placement as you must place adjacent to dice already present unless you are the first one to place a die in the action circle. It creates and presents interesting puzzles to solve as you seek to complete your missions. The code breaking aspect is odd and while it fits thematically, I'm less certain how I feel about its presence in the game being necessary/desirable. 

I also don't believe all the agent powers are equal - I would avoid using the one that allows you to turn in any two cubes to acquire an agency card in a three player game as it is relatively useless.

A very good dice placement game with some interesting twists. I love the visuals and, for a typical Euro game, I think that the mechanics implement the theme rather well. Also very good as a two player game.

Clever game. I've played it twice at this point. Likely better with fewer players, as it takes a long time with 4 players. If it was faster, I'd rate it higher. I really like it otherwise. I might house rule the game to remove the code breaking part, as it felt tacked on and adds to AP and longer playing time.

PREFACE: I have to admit that I'm a bit disappointed with my first play. It is probably not completely the games fault that I feel that way. I had high hopes, but whether it was too late in the evening or just distracted I just didn't completely enjoy my first game. Having said that, I think I rated this higher than I actually feel it should be, after that first game.

I felt like there was too much going on for me. I couldn't keep track of all of my missions and corresponding needs to accomplish them. I felt like I was constantly giving away the wrong agency card for 1 of it's 3 options not realizing I needed that other option for completing a different mission. Then I had to waste my die I placed on completing a mission because I could not recover from that mistake. I typically like having cards with multiple uses and lots of choices but for whatever reason this just wasn't enjoyable. I suppose I kind of felt like I was doing homework rather than being immersed in a spy themed game. Or you could say... I was like Austin Powers facing off against Jason Bourne, Ethan Hunt, and James Bond. Outmatched in every way. So here's hoping for a better outcome the next session.

A good game but not great, feels like a lot of elements could use smoothing out . I find the whole decoder thing a bit 'tacked on' also placing you dice and then resolving them a whole round later is just irritating and increases game time and AP a lot. Trying to plot out your turn accounting for being screwed over is highly frustrating and slow. 

The art is fantastic buuuut its a little irritating that the symobols and art are so different I found myself staring at the agency cards for ages trying to find the symbols I need

Also as with all Renegade games over priced for the components
Needa another play to make up my mind

This game is awesome. I'm surprised it isn't rated higher. I have two criticisms though: first is that there's almost too much going on, and it can take a while to plan out your moves; second is that I wish there was more directly adversarial interplay since it's a "spy" theme. Having an aspect of the game where you could steal from your opponent, or even destroy something of theirs to sabotage them would have been cool. I've considered adding something to that effect as a variant.

Those are nitpicks though. It's a beautiful game, and works for 2-4 players equally well. My favorite parts of it are the artwork, and the mechanics.

RATING: N/A
We've only played this once - so this review will lack a rating for now because we still feel like we're missing some nuances and steps in the progress of this game. It's very fun though - as we played it with two-players and lasted all evening long. There's many different aspects to focus on, but in all - we ultimately want to gain as many victory points as possible through all the various mission types and items you collect throughout the game. 

We'll update the rating for this - but if you're up for a challenge with a bit of a learning curve - check the game out. You won't be disappointed.

The great mechanics of this game are ruined by the completely unbalanced mission deck that is also plagued by an insanely huge swing in points range of 3-15. Covert is really a great game in disguise as an unpolished and never play tested concept. Either the mission deck needs to be completely re-designed or re-balanced. Until then, this game's designer and/or producer deserve to be shamed for selling a disgustingly unfinished product.

RATING: 7
Dice/worker placement game with some resource management. You're trying to complete mission cards for VP by using other cards as the resources or having your meeples in a certain place on the map. Most of the game, you will be trying to get those resources by drafting cards or manipulating numbers to match sequences on your locked equipment cards. Fun, strategic game. The only negative I would say is that the game is a lot heavier than it seems at first glance. Also, not all of the mission card VP values seem balanced enough. Some low point cards are a lot harder to complete than some higher point cards.

Played once--seemed solid, with a clever dice placement mechanism. Didn't leave a strong impression but I'd certainly play again; the game went slowly with new players but I got the impression it could move fast with experienced players. I found I didn't want to bother moving my agents around much (which unless you burn a card or have a special ability is fairly slow) when I could just grab missions that didn't require being in specific spots on the board. -- Handsome board but the iconography and choice of fonts are nearly indecipherable at times.

I don't know what it is about Renegade Games, but they almost never rise above mediocrity for me. I honestly don't know why they're so popular right now. Covert is perhaps the best case as to why I dislike their games. For a game about spies, this felt abstract, dull, and boring as hell. This really is the last straw for me with this company. They, more than any other company right now, are over-saturating the market with fluff like this, and I refuse to support that.

This game exceeded my expectations and restored my faith in the spy theme as it had disappointed me a couple times in the past.  The game boils down to completing tasks and collecting the cards needed to get it done.  The dice placement mechanism used in this game is a variation I have not seen before and adds a nice twist to your strategy.  The game also plays well with two which is a big plus.

RATING: 7
A semi-entertaining game that never fully utilizes its fun theme. Individually, the mechanics work well together: dice placement that determines actions wrapped around pick-up-and-deliver-type missions. One element of the game I believed was inventive (but not as thematic as it sounds) was the "code-breaking" phase every round: players can swap two numbers on the main board and if it matches one of their own private combinations, they get a "free" resource. It was the element of the game I wish would have been exploited and made more central to the game itself, rather than a rehash of very basic worker placement games. As much as I love the artwork of the game, I think it's more of a distraction than an improvement. With a theme as rich and exciting as spies and agencies and the thrill of international cat-and-mouse chases, the game is instead, at its core, dice placement and mission fulfillment. From the look of the box, Covert might promise, hidden information, deduction and hidden role-type mechanics, yet its soul is very clearly the opposite of that type of excitement. Despite this mismatch between theme and game design, I didn't really have a problem with the way the game played. It was balanced and the final score was very close; I was proud of some of my turns as this game can be AP-inducing and every decision can turn to a standstill as one player makes their calculations. Usually, I'm not a fan of those games but this experience was tolerable and short with only two players. Overall, I want to play this game again with the game's capacity of four players. I wonder if I'm wrong on my assumption that maybe Covert could use a re-theme to your generic "Euro-merchants-in-whatever-land-in-whatever-period" theme. Maybe it would have been better off if they went that way.

Covert is a dice-placement game where the values of the dice only matter with respect to the other dice.  Each of the four main actions has six spaces for differently-valued dice--the first die placed can be any value, but subsequent dice have to be placed in adjacent spots.  This can be problematic if too many dice of the same value are rolled, but fortunately everyone starts with a re-roll token, and dice can also be used to influence code-breaking track where you try to match patterns of numbers, or be used to draw random special ability chits.  The four main actions are moving one of your three pawns around the map board, draw a card from a region where your pawn is, take a mission card, and complete a mission.  The missions are the main scoring in the game, they require some combination of items depicted on cards and pawns being in certain places.  Sometimes, missions also provide permanent symbols corresponding to either the card items or locations that can be used to complete future missions.  This game has some interesting ideas, and I found it to be pretty fun.

Decent spy theme with a very good implementation of the modern gaming concept of a lot of different ways to acquire the stuff you need to complete a small set of tasks. Reminds me of Ticket to Ride smashed together with Istanbul and 7 Wonders. There are quire a bit of symbols, but I don't feel overloaded with symbols like a do when I play 7 Wonders. The group I played with also felt like Pandemic was an influence on the game design - me not so much.

Most of the mechanics are well known, but the lock tumbler seems pretty unique and having to place subsequent dice on the roundels adjacent to existing dice also seems fresh. I was very happy with my first play and even though there are lots of rules, I picked them up quickly.

I finally had the chance to play Covert and am glad I decided it was not going to be for me as far as ownership.  I wouldn't have even reviewed it but to counter the designer's self-rated "10". -- only the box art deserves that.  The theme portended great spy intrigue.  But its really a somewhat dry euro with set collection and an europuzzle disguised as code breaking.   It feels like the designer wanted to cram a multitude of mechanisms into the game which do little more than create tedious "analysis paralysis" issues.  The game does create the potential for spy like elimination of players who take way too long to figure out their turns, however.   That's the closest the game comes to evoking the spy theme for me.  Blech.  Such a shame given the super cool, dark "spy theme" box art that somehow the game board art fails to convey at all?

Manage your network of spies in Europe to complete tasks and gain reputation for your organization. Send your agents to Berlin for an assassination attempt on one of ISIS's leaders. Drop one of your spies in Italy to gather intelligence for a future mission. Covert blends a number of genres to make a truly great game. There are aspects of set collection, dice rolling, worker placement, area control, and engine building. The components are great and the cards are intuitive. One of the best games I've played to date.

Dice-worker placement where you're moving spies arou d the board to crack codes and fulfill contracts. Various actuons tie together well and everything moved at a swift pace. There is some luck of the draw in the cards, but there are a handful of ways to mitigate any luck from cards or dice. I was worried there would be too much blocking in the dice placement phase, but we didn't find much issue in the 4-player game. We did like the player interrsction of picking up intel cubes where other agents had travelled though.

Tentative rating here, as I'd like to play it again. On the surface, this seems simple, as you're just allocating dice to a couple of actions, which are pretty much to get items to satisfy missions, move around the board, get new missions, or complete a mission. The challenge is that there is a very fine balance and ordering that must be maintained in order to be effective in getting the items and missions that you want at the right times. It's pretty brain-burnery and that can slow it down and make it move more slowly and take longer than it feels that it should. I have mixed emotions about it after my first play, but do look forward to a couple more plays firming up my opinion.

Very thematic set collecting, area control, and dice worker placement game. Here you are spies trying to complete missions and crack codes. The game has great graphic design/illustrations to truly make you feel like you are in a spy network in Europe. The randomness in the card draws was at times very frustrating. This coupled with the fact that the game dragged out a little too long is why I gave it an average rating. When I played, everyone at the table was a new player so that definitely added to the slow game play.

Major brain-burner (multiple interlocking mechanisms) that can be quite prone to AP. But it's also quite fun. Multi-use cards seems to be all the rage.

One aspect I really like is the permanent icon attached to some missions (adding certain locations/personages to your network). I also like the trailing mechanic where 2 cubes from the same opponent gets you a free Agency card. Still, the theme seems oddly mismatched at times (e.g., the Mission cards are very bland).

Just a smidgen short of being a true professional release (what's up with the pictures on the back cover, totally wasted space) - this is a good (but not great) game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.25
Tentative rating from 1 game with 4 players.

The game has some interesting things going on, but feels like a hodgepodge of mechanisms and other things thrown all together. The "decoder" is neat but very restrictive and super random based on getting codes that work with the initial setup or work with other players sliding stuff around.

So much of the game is about mitigating the chaos and randomness of cards that come up and just feels like there's very little control. If you manage to get lucky and get cards that synergize together you'll simply do much better than others. The random starting locations, random starting missions, and huge variety of cards all makes it kind of messy.

Plus, the starting player powers do not feel balanced at all. Some were used every turn to great effect while others were almost never used.

I'd try the game again, but feel like it might just not be for me. Too much chaos and randomness and random things thrown together in an attempt to feel "spy" themed.

tl;dr: solid strategy game

Roam the board, gather intelligence and stuff, manage your cards well and solve cases. In essence this is a resource gathering and order fulfillment game, but they tried hard to give it a good amount of theme. I thought they did a reasonable job.
Also, the way in which the worker placement part works and is executed is quite effective and can give nice tension. In what order do you take your actions? You might want to do a certain action before the other players to make sure you grab something first, but that might make an other action less efficient.
I quite enjoyed playing this, but at the same time, nothing about the game blew me away. It's competently made, but it doesn't stand out, unless maybe you care for the theme.

The spy theme looks very well implemented here, and dice placement is fun.

Covert looks great and every decision you make in the game feels like it's helping you toward your endgame. The multi-use cards are well designed and the dice manipulation and set collection add fun little puzzles to a larger overall experience. 

I'm curious how the game plays at larger player counts, having only played a game with two. This game seems like it lends itself to 'hate placement' much more than other worker placement games. That's not a negative in my eyes, but I can see how some players would be turned off by that.

My Wife and I like this game a lot as a two player game.  I have not played with more than 2.

Plenty of planning in this worker placement/hand management game.  We don't play as ruthless on blocking of actions as we probably should be but still makes for some interesting decisions in which actions to take and with which dice.  I like how some of the cards have more than 1 purpose.  IE code cards are either victory points or an item.  Agency cards are either flights to a city, an item, or an ability.

Tentative rating after a couple of plays so far. It's a very think-y game, induces AP and forces dumb mistakes as you get focused on five things and forget two others. These characteristics could go either way, but in this case it's very fun. Some ambiguity in the details of the rules, haven't yet looked for answers in forums, just made assumptions. A bit of clunkiness in one or two of the actions, nothing too bad. All these slight reservations aside, a very fun game, you want to play again to see if you can do better. You just have to be patient with each other's turns. Plays well with two, not sure if it really needs more with these characteristics.

After several more plays, we definitely like this game, and most of the above remains true, particularly the AP nature, the high frequency of blunders(runaway victories do happen), and the slight clunkiness. But it's pretty great, and it is in steady rotation for my wife and me. I definitely want to try it with more players, also.

Cover looks good but doesn't really inspire me to play it. but someone suggested it and so I tried it. Learning the game was a bit confusing at first but once I got the rules I found out I love this game

A slow burner of the game. There is a lot to keep track of and ways to inadvertently block/help your opponents.

I think this game lasts way too long. A missed opportunity for a really cool theme - for those of us that care about such things. The theme here is nothing but the thin veneer needed to tie together set collection and a number puzzle. I am sure it is fine for gamers that don't care about theme, in fact I know it is because my friends quite liked it. Honestly if the mechanisms really rock I could even get past the theme issue, but nothing stood out there. They aren't bad, but nothing exciting in my opinion.

Only played twice with spouse. I absolutely love it. Our first game was a tie. 50 pets each, second game she beat me by 1 point. It really was a good tight game. It's not hard, got a few good crunchy decisions to be made. You NEED to plan out your whole turn in advance.
I think 6.28 is very low rating for the game.

Strategy spy game to complete the most missions using set collection and code breaking incorporating several game systems.  Variable power spy characters, multi-use agent cards, worker placement on a Europe map to satisfy mission assignments and collect Intel.  Programmed dice action draft phase with a unique +1/-1 constraint adds a nice cat & mouse and blocking mechanic.  Code break mini game adds a nice thematic side element.  Players conceal their score, assets, and missions behind big privacy screens which I am not a big fan.  But, I still enjoy how the game elements work together and I like how completed missions add to your spy gear for future missions.

After we got going, the moves became more intuitive, and while we enjoyed the game, it seemed to run a bit long.  Hopefully next time will go quicker now that we know what we are doing.  Also, it seems like the board is too small or the spies are too big.  Still a lot of fun though!

RATING: 5
I found this game very heavy as you try to organize your thoughts and then adjust them as others fowl them up (unintentionally). You have to prioritize things and then start over as others take the 2 cards or adjust the combination lock that you needed. It does move faster after the halfway point but it did take a long time it seemed. I only played once but would like to try again.

Such an awesome game, there's a lot going on, almost overwhelming at first, but then you realize you don't "have to" do everything, after a few plays it flows very well. Good as 2 player where you don't want direct conflict, and the theme comes though very well

Competitive (Best 2P)

RFS:
-Too much information at given time, hence prone to analysis paralysis & long down times
-At higher player counts, your choices matter less since few players would have taken their turn before you

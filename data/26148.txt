Monkey Tennis.  A dexterity game that has a lot of strategy thrown in.  Hard to find, but a LOT of fun.  It would be really easy to add your own figures too!  I'd love to see some rules for doubles.

Um mit mehreren ein Turnier spielen zu können, benötigt man idealerweise wenigstens 2 Felder.

Takes a while to guage the power of the firing mechanism but once you do, this becomes quite a tactical little dexterity game.

Cloth needs to be clamped to the table to smooth out creases.

Loads of fun!  Couldn't picture how the rule for "under pressure" worked, but once somebody demonstrated them, the game was entirely straighforward with lots to think about.  Works well as a doubles game as well.

Funny game that simulates tennis fairly well.   The monkeys are great, and it's fun for a while.   Certainly have no desire to play this more than once every few years, but I do like the fact that this game exists.

RATING: 5
A dexterity game (in the form of the 'tennis racquet' device) with some fairly logical euro-style movement rules thrown in (though, for me, these do detract from the flow of the game). Does a good job recreating a tennis match. Why the monkeys, you ask. Well, obviously robot monkeys from the future would have been better but you can't have everything, can you?

A colleague of mine who used to work as a semi-professional tennis coach said after playing that he would consider using Affentennis to teach tennis beginners the basic tactics of the game. Now this is a huge compliment.

I like it! Ok, like most dexterity games, it might have limited replayability but played by two equally-skilled opponents, it could get quite exciting as both would be able to return each other's shots, until one makes a mistake. Just like tennis!

RATING: 8.5
Fun action game, with a large play surface and smart ideas to produce a good sim for tennis. Practise is required, but after a while it turned into a good tennis match. Not sure if I'll get a copy, but I wouldn't turn one away.** It's only 29 Euros!! Got mine! *** Got my own copy and improved my rating to 7.5, it's a hoot. It also plays very very well, and a well-placed shot will beat your opponent. We played the basic game, but I want to improve my skills and play the lob and smash shots.*** Improved my rating again to 8.5, this game is a smash hit. Hugely popular at BM!, it really plays and feels like tennis. We are already trying the advanced shots and two players want to buy copies. The only complaint, you cannot play doubles!

An amazing game, that recreates the game of tennis in a very good way. Lots of fun to be had with this one and easy to learn. If you don't like dexterity games, you may wanna steer clear of this one. I on the other hand happen to like quite a few of them as you can see from my owned list.

The components in this game are extremely well made and look great. There are some really nice mechanics in this game, that work well  and it is a lot of fun to play. This game will turn heads and draw a crowd, so be ready to answer lots of questions.

A terrific game that everyone should try at least once.

Ridiculous. Also does kind of feel like playing tennis, including the part where it goes on longer than you might enjoy. But I mean, monkeys.

The included gadgets for simulating various tennis techniques (the smash bloc, the lob ramp, etc.) are ingenious and manage to give the feeling that you're making up the whole thing as you go.

The given rating is provisional. I was taught this game today. Although it starts a bit awkwardly, it then develops into a very interesting game. Want to play more!

#15/DEC/07: Played some more and can say that this game is very good. I'm not big on tennis, hence my sticking to a 7 rating, but the game sure captures the essence of tennis. Recommended!

Monkey Tennis! Really unique dexterity game that simulates tennis quite well. Players use the rubber-band powered shooters to hit a plastic ball to the opposite court. Your monkey can move a bit before hitting the ball and after, and you can borrow after-hit movement to reach a ball, but then you are limited in how you can hit back and you won't be able to recover to a more neutral position - emulating very well the effect of going balls-out to make a hit. There are other wooden tools to use to simulate playing at the net (the "volley block"), hitting lobs (the "lob ramp") and smashing the ball (the "smash block"). The net is simulated by having an extra piece of fabric under the center line creating a small hump that you need to hit your ball over. The key to the game is figuring out the right pressure to get over the hump without hitting it out the back of the court. It can take some practice. Centering your racquet shooter correctly is just as important as applying the right pressure! Worth finding.

Affentennis is a great idea and a lot of fun to look at. The monkeys, even though they are completely superfluous, are what makes the game interesting. It is impressive how well the game seems to model an actual game of tennis.

That said, it takes longer than I would like a dexterity game to take, and the rules complexity is also a little higher than my preference. But if you have a dedicated opponent, I think this could potentially be a lot of fun. If I ever get to that point I could definitely see having to adjust my rating.

While my skills leave a good bit to be desired, the design of this one is quite unique and interesting.  After one play I'm still trying to figure out if there is ever much opportunity for lob shots or slams or volley blocks, but I will admit that I am no expert and we were just starting to explore different ways to use the shooter to hit the tennis ball.  Maybe the table was tilted too..hmmmm, that must have been it!

Monkey tennis - all that Alan Partridge could of dreamed of.

We played one doubles match without the wooden blocks, simulating smash, lob, volley block etc, to get used to the Rubber Band Mechanisms (RBMs) and gameplay.  We ran out of time to play a second match but I look forward to the opportunity to get back onto the court.

Affentennis is a strong simulation of tennis and Jurgen Kohl wisely avoided messing around with the actual rules of tennis.  Therefore, as in other strong sport simulations, such as Subbuteo, the only challenge left to the designer is how to simulate movement of players and movement of the ball.

Movement of players is done intelligently and creates real strategy reflecting the reality of tennis.  For example, in actual tennis you want to move your opponent around the court so they are in parts of the court they do not want to be in.  For example movement of the player is more expensive going backwards therefore a basic strategy is to draw your opponent off the base line so they find making returns harder.

In contrast the movement of the ball is an initial drawback.  This will diminish as you gain experience but it can be frustrating at the start and therefore an initial obstacle to everyone enjoying the game.  The RBMs are erratic with serves at the start often going long, hitting the net or returns limply going short.  At the start of the game I had flashbacks to my youth playing park tennis in the downpours of an English summer where having the serve is often a weakness rather than a strength. I believe replacing the RBMs with mini snooker cues (maximum length 30cms)would give the players greater control from the start and not damage gameplay.  With practice you would even be able to curl or swerve the ball which would bring the game even closer to actual tennis.

Therefore, though the RBMs made the start painful (the first three games no-one held serves and there were no significant rallies) we did improve and patterns of play emerged that reflected actual tennis.

Affentennis is a good game which I believe my score will increase with repeated play, the use of the wooden blocks and replacing the RBMs with mini snooker cues.

Some weird ideas and abstractions of the rules of tennis are included, but the overall impression was still positive. Like all dexterity games, this one needs some practise before it's playable.

That breakthrough (or something) should be left aside, because it really harasses the real play. I enjoyed the game more without it. 

Affentennis was a positive experience, definitely would play more! If only the board was cheaper or the availability better...

Excellent dexterity game with tons of fun. I do like Tennis Masters, and this game is even better. Strongly recommended.
After 100+ games we found that two small changes improved the game:
- a slightly wider ramp for the lob (otherwise it is simply too difficult and we never use it)
- a change in the rule for the serve: you have a max of 6 movement points for the return. And if you use 4-6 movement points you are under pressure. If you need more than 6 ... bugger - it's an ace.

Good fun and cute, but it's more a novelty game to play with the kids when it's raining outside and they'd rather be playing tennis for real. You've got to be a fan of the game I guess. Play it quickly and just for a hit and giggle and it's really quite fun. It's tricky to hit the ball with finesse - the power shots seem easier - but it is a satisfying feeling when you get it just right.

RATING: 5
The shot-selection and positioning make this dexterity game feel a lot like real tennis. The flicking mechanism is pretty cool, and the volley, lob, smash (!!!) rules really spice things up.

Good dexterity games involve you planning your shot out, then trying to match it with your trajectory. The planning in Affentennis is better than most, and the shot is fun and satisfying. 

A winner for two players who like to play or watch tennis.

This is a great simulation of two monkeys playing tennis.  My overall impression is that this is actually a very good game, but I had such a difficult time with the irregularity of the plunger that I ended up doing myself more harm than good.  I'd like to try putting Carrom's anti-friction powder in them.  

If this were a flicking game on mylar I'd give it a 9...Hmmm.

RATING: 8.5
The best dexterity game I have seen so far. Have learned the rules yesterday and my first impression after the most basical rules were somethink like
"Okay, so we shoot those balls around a bit and someone wins later on... okay, is that supposed to be fun?"
But then there are those special rules which catch the feeling of a tennis match very good!
You can run to the net and block your opponent for example. You can exhaust him with accurate shoots to the different side of the court and then force the point for later on.
Therefore there is a bit of tactic in the game which really moved raised my interest a lot!
It's still a dexterity game and you have to hit correctly but that's okay for me.

The rating of 9 shouldn't mean that I prefer this game to all those I've rated below because this one is - as a dexterity game - something special.
I have to be in the right mood to play a dexterity game but when I think this one really shines!

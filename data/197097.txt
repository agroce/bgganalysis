Just a great, randomly generated solo dungeon crawl.  Fantastic game with tons of expansion potential.  This would probably be a great way to introduce a younger or inexperienced player to role playing games as well.

I felt obligated to raise my rating a half point. I have had the game for a year and a half. During that time I have played other games, researched other games and tried to write my own games. So far, this game does a better job of creating the atmosphere and play environment that I am looking for. It isn't what I would call my perfect game for the thing that I imagine I want it to be, but it is the closest I can find. Nothing else even comes close for me. I really like this game and for the distribution method, it is presented nicely. If you like dungeons, solo play, fantasy RPG's and an old school feel, you might want to give this a try.

Great random dungeon crawling. The book is laid out in a weird way, and rules are sort of all over the place. It's great fun though!

Only played a few hours at the time of this scoring; enjoyed it so far and I'm getting all the expansions printed up too. Solid little solo dungeon crawler and my daughter even tagged along for an hour which is rare.

One amazing game!  The level of thematic detail in this game is fantastic and the gameplay is top notch!  So much fun, even if you opt for a multiplayer Co-op in your game!

A nice print and play game with a lot of dice chucking and a scribbly map you can draw while playing. I found it to be a very relaxing solo experience!

I've probably played this 3 or 4 times and it seems to take much longer than it should.  The random nature of the dungeons sometimes creates absurd results (for example, many empty rooms, then the dragon as my first encounter, finding the wand of sleep twice, etc).  Some of the vermin fights are so dull that I wonder why I bother.  I like the inspiration that this draws from old school d&d (morale, marching order, graph paper) and the overall feel but these days I think I want a more tightly designed game. I stopped the last two games because I felt like I was just going through the motions. The organization of the rules is pretty bad.  I think I will play the two modules I own, however.

RATING: 9
Really impressed with this game, it seems to be everything I'd want in a solo dungeon delve. There is a strong focus on resource management, Life Points and Spells for the most part, but there is also a good sense of exploration. The system is very simple and modular so I can pretty easily see ways to expanded upon it. New tables, different flow chart, new monsters, different random room/corridor structures... whoo boy.

What makes it more awesome though, in this father of four's opinion, is how little overhead there is with the game: grab the rules, some dice, your party's record sheet, and a piece of graph paper and you're good to go.

Might be the honeymooon period, but this is an easy 9. Depending on how this is expanded, could be a 10.

I haven't had this much fun with a game in a while.  I can't wait to continue my exploration as well as combination with other rule sets to make a system that works best for me.  If you don't own this, you owe it to yourself to pick it up.  For $8, it can't be beat.

20160409: With only half a play it's early to rate it, but at best this can be either a very light rpg, or perhaps a solo dungeon crawling resource management challenge. I am looking to the improved layout of the rules, as the current one is rather atrocious.

Aquela nostalgia de jogar RPG, me lembra muitos jogos de computador em especial o legend of grimrock. É print and play apenas se quiser imprimir as regras do resto nada que algumas folhas, um lápis, borracha e 2 dados de 6 lados não resolvam. Existem diversas expansões. E a rejogabilidade é alta.

Some charts, pencil sketches, and die rolls blossom into cool dungeon bashing narratives - just add imagination.

This game rocks.

Pretty fun, for the first 20 minutes.
Repetitive, overly long, basically a slough through a dungeon involving: dice roll - dice roll - dice roll - write something on your sheet - dice roll -dice roll - next room.

My first PNP styled RPG game. I guess technically it's more of a dungeon crawler.

RATING: 9
Fantastic. Excellent. The solo dungeon crawl I've been looking for; deep, yet simple. There's not a TON of content, but it doesn't NEED it, as there is much to be explore. Some results will simply not get rolled, and that's perfectly fine.

I'm very much looking forward to hacks and supplements to this game.

I have played over 16 solo games and I do not tire of it. The supplements help bringing in more variety, as does integrating material from other solo games.

I strongly advise using the BARBARIAN PRINCE game rules (simply replace Combat by Level, minus one, and treat groups as minions) for a free, high variety supplement for outdoors hexcrawls:

The rules are not so amazingly written, there's a lot of clarity lacking. Underneath all that there's a very cool game lurking, and once you hammer through and settle on a fixed set of well-understood rules, you can get to having a lot of good procedurally generated fun

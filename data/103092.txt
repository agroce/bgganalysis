Pretty decent game, but there's so many things to track.  To an extent, you are at the mercy of how your opponents play too.  If they don't populate their buildings, you can't marry into them, and it limits your available actions.  Pretty art, but I spent a lot of time squinting at it.  The role selection is fun and the scoring is intuitive.  I'm not sure it's my thing, but I'm glad to have played it.

I played this game just three times, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

Helvetia is for sure a well designed game and it has very interesting mechanics. I really liked the ideas in it, based on what I read about the game! The action selection mechanism, the combination with the majority aspect and the idea of interconnecting your game with the other players all seemed very cool. Also the name on the box, Matthias Cramer, was really encouraging for me, since I love Lancaster. Then I played the game a few times and, even if 3 plays are not enough to judge a game, I have to say that it was disappointing. 

All those mechanisms that suggested a very interesting and deep gameplay felt sadly quite flat. The action selection system gives for sure some choices to make, but it's not as tense and tactical as I thought. The majority aspect disappointed me even more, because it's actually just passing each other a couple of points back and forth for most of the game. The interconnection created by the marriage mechanism looked really interesing too, but it just wasn't exciting or deep as I expected. The game felt actually very repetitive, as all you have to do is to sell goods and gather a few more points in some other way. This means that there's not a variety of strategies... which sometimes is also fine, if the game is still challenging and interesing. In this case instead it seems to me, that the game would play exactly the same every time.

Overall Helvetia is not a bad game, but it isn't a good one either. It's a clever choice of mechanisms, that are even put well together, but it doesn't make the game fun. It feels unrefined and very repetitive. Such a pity!

1st play: Perfect example of the 2 plays rule. There's a ton of advanced planning here, opportunities to use other player's buildings and snipe their rewards. I think I enjoyed the challenge this game presents but found this game really challenging to blend the need for new workers alongside the desire to trade, build, and marry. The marriage system is a really cool implementation of the shared building concept. Good chunky bits and interlocking mechanisms that make you think.

No second play.

This was an interesting supply chain type of game, where you need to build buildings to produce good to deliver to the market, but some goods need a chain of other goods to be made. Also, you need to have lots of kids to staff the buildings you build, and marry them out to gain access to extra actions on other player's boards. This mechanic was somewhat interesting, but unless we set up wrong, also fairly restrictive. We had a couple of goods that were only on one player's board and if you missed that marriage, you were shut out of the bonus VP for that part of the delivery tree.

I like the race to 20 points with shifting VP, as each of the majority bonus tiles for each of the 5 actions carries with it 1 VP but they come and go as the tiles move around each round. The production quality is quite nice, it's a shame its OOP as it just really doesn't feel worth any sort of premium, but a nice game overall.

How many times have we been here before?  You build buildings to produce resources to build more buildings.  There are some short tech trees that require that, for instance, if you're to produce cheese, you need first some water and then a goat.  There are jobs to choose from and workers to multiply.  There's even the possibility to switch late on to buildings that earn only vps. The sole original element is the possibility to exploit other players' buildings by marrying one of your workers to one of theirs.  That's not nearly enough to rescue this game from a tiresome sense of deja vu.

The artwork is functional, though very brown.  Building cost icons could have been larger or better differentiated.  The rules are clear enough and production quality is to the usual Kosmos standard.

RATING: 6.5
Interesting mechanisms sadly didn't make up for what appears to be a huge basic flaw in the game.  If you don't take the Midwife action a lot early on, and you don't have people marrying into your village, you can be out of the game in the first 2-3 rounds.  If only one player is in that position after the first couple of rounds, you probably have your winner!  The rest of the game is a play for second unless they make mistakes along the way.  It's the runaway leader issue.  The more workers you have, the more buildings you can build and the faster you can claim your additional action tokens.  The early advantage builds on itself, and things just get easier and easier for that person.  That's how it was in our first play.  By the end of the second round we all knew who would win.  By the end of the third we pretty much knew who would be second.  The only question in the game was who would be last... 

A game needs more strategic variety than that.

It's a shame because I really expected to like this one.  I'll give it one more try but unless I can be shown that there are other viable strategies in the early going, I doubt I'd play it a third time.

This game is hard to characterize. It has a classic euro theme, and seems to be about building efficient production chains, but it's surprisingly brutal, with resource denial (and preventing that) being a key aspect to winning. It's _hard_ to play this well, and the game is way heavier than you'd expect based on the rules and surface feel.
I _think_ it's actually a really good and tight heavy game, but I'm still having trouble seeing it for what it really is.

A bit of a brain-burner - there are many different options available on each turn, and finding the best is hard work!  Good ideas here, and feels a bit different to anything else. Might get a little repetitive though - most of the turns are very similar.

RATING: 9.5
Just a magnificent game.  With only five different actions, Cramer creates a kind of a race to get bonus tiles, while managing to get enough people, marry them and breed.  The marriage/breeding mechanism creates a fantastic interrelation between players.  Production is very good, although men and women should be even more different, in my opinion, and the stickers for babies are just horrible.

This is the third game designed by Matthias Cramer I tried, after the wonderful duo Glen More / Lancaster. It is indeed quite different from both the previous efforts of the designer.
The first thing to note is the gorgeous production: the game box is one that catches the eye, and the components are well designed, wonderfully illustrated and made of thick and durable cardboard and wood (though, the rulebook - or at least the couple of translations from german I have - is quite confusing and we did screw things up on our first play...).
Furthermore, the theme is one that intrigued me: the idea of developing a small alpine village, with the chance to send the daughters to the nearby valley for marriage, is quite interesting.
But what about the game?
Helvetia is a game of resources conversion, with a mechanic similar to the one used in Neuland (a game I wasn't particularly fond of): you don't actually produce resources, instead you create "chains" of resources to reach an end. This end can be one amongst many, but the final goal is obtain victory points.
There are, however, a couple of twists, like a pseudo worker-placement with the owner of a majority on a particular character obtaining a "free" use of that character on the next round.
In the end, Helvetia is the less impressive and the less intuitive of the three Cramer's games, but this is probably due more to the other two being such great games, than to the demerits of Helvetia.
I am definitely looking forward to re-play Helvetia with more players, and the initial rating (6.5) could be adjusted after gathering new impressions.

Helvetia is a needlessly complex eurogame: as usual with this kind of games, its resource micromanagement is quickly alienating (if not utterly annoying) as a player rarely has all he needs to perform the action needed. And when he finally gathers what he needs, he’s usually anticipated in his move by another player, who did that action just because yet another player anticipated his planned action and so on. Nonetheless, Helvetia seems to have something appealing in it: I have yet to understand what it is though. [i](October 2011)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - Four years later I still haven’t found out what that was, apart from Helvetia being one of the very first boardgames I played after coming back to the hobby just the month before: more than enough to strip this boring eurogame of its rating during my Fall 2015 rating revise and cast it into the pits of forgetfulness it and its kin belong to.

RATING: 6
I wish the men and women were just a tad more distinguishable, and that the icons were more readable across the board, as you have people in others' villages. Other than those issues, I really like this one. The "production without the actual bits" could catch on. The marriages increase the interaction, and make the involvement more than just a race for vps.

Edit: Traded away as the production made me more annoyed than the game was worth. Might be willing to pick up again if it comes with hat stickers and maybe new tile art. Maybe.

There's something about the swiss flag that makes me feel all warm and fuzzy.  Maybe I was a swiss cow herder in a former life.

In any case, I quite liked this game.  The family element was pretty clever, and the race for points added tension.   The one part that I thought was a bit annoying was that it takes 3 turns before you can use a building you have bought, which means that it's nearly impossible to change your strategy quickly if you need to.   

Initial rating 8.

My husband picked this one in Germany while shopping in a department store (I wish the U.S. were a little more like Germany!). It's absolutely beautiful, and quite fun. I like how gaining a majority tile after choosing actions not only gives you a bonus action but also serves as a temporary victory point, which can make the final turn of the game an amusing hodgepodge of actions. I also think that the dowry mechanic is interesting, by allowing you to gain actions of your own or deprive your opponent of their own actions. The artwork is just awesome, and the whole game looks amazing laid out on the table. The dummy player works well for two players, and really changes the feel of the game.

A pretty cool little strategy game of utilizing your family members to collect goods which you can then deliver for points, or use to build more buildings to increase your production capacity or to score more points!

There are some interesting things going on here, in that you can marry your family members into the other player's villages in order to use the abilities of their buildings.

Additionally, there is a kinda-sorta worker placement mechanic in place.  There are 5 actions available to do things such as deliver goods for points, make babies, get marries, build buildings, or rest your family members.  You have 6 action chips to use per game round, so on your turn you place one or more chips on an action to take that action, with the positions of your family members in the villages often mattering in terms of what you can do with that action.

Overall, a good resource management/optimization game if you're into that sort of thing!

Unfortunately, I liked the idea of the game and the game mechanics much more than I actually liked the game itself. I tend to like Matthias Cramer’s games but this one turned out to be bland.

This was quite an underwhelming resource converting game (in its highest sense; you really do convert good A to B to C…) As the game progressed it seemed a lot like a logistical exercise! It is quite important to be able to piggyback of your opponents in the sense that you want to activate your workers in their villages and have them woken up by your opponents – I liked this part.
There were a couple of other very clever mechanics such as the man/woman meeple and the marrying into other’s villages, but other than that I didn’t find any interesting mechanics here. The actual worker placement was only “ok”; there are only five roles, but the tension of the game comes in the fact that a round ends as soon as only one player has workers left – and that meant that you were sometimes at the mercy of the other players, so it can be a cutthroat game! 

The game quickly became a little confusing due to the cluttered buildings, so it wasn’t easy to create an overview of the game status. Overall I found it a bit “meh” – there are many other better medium weight eurogames that plays in 60-90 minutes.

So, Helvetia strikes me as a slightly different take on worker placement, resource conversion, etc. etc. Although having male and female meeples is kinda cool, and marrying off the meeples onto other people's player boards is neat as well... I dunno, the game struck me as "been there, done that." There are plenty, plenty of options of games that test you to gain A/B/C resources to build X building to make yet more resources to buy victory points. Maybe if I stumbled across the game earlier I'd like it more, but my reaction today to this game is a solid "meh." I'd play it again, but I won't miss it at all.

Pleasant enough Euro. Rather than getting more and more VPs each turn, you calc your current VP each turn, and the game ends when someone earns 20+ VP on their turn. Get married, make babies, send them to school, then give them a job! Pretty straight forward game over all.

First impression: some new/interesting mechanics in here, but at it's core, it's worker placement as usual. The game feels very deterministic and i didn't like the fixed game end condition (20 VP or more), too. The representation with big tiles and a lot of wood for pawns and actions markers ist lovely, but the graphic style is not to my taste. Although the buildings and persons are very rich detailed, the whole look is like a 80ties computer game of "Settlers". And the box cover is completely misleading! How do you expect an german game when glancing on a swiss flag and the Matterhorn?!

RATING: 4
Helvetia got my attention because of a superficial resemblence to Glen More (topological building activation), and so when the game appeared at Spiel 2011 my partner and I spent a long time trying to find a spot to play. This proved impossible, so we postponed making the game's acquaintance. Helvetia indeed turns out to have a few similarities to Glen More, but actually noticably less than a cursory glance at the rules would suggest. Basically the game is a point race: you get points for selling things to the market, and if you are the first you get a bonus; if you are the first to complete various 'trees' of market goods, you get another bonus. Those market goods are obtained from activating buildings in your own play area, with an activation simply meaning laying down a meeple on it, and either obtaining or transforming the required goods. This is really stock-standard stuff. Where Helvetia departs is in its attempt to depict something of 'married life': you can 'marry into' another player's play area, and thus activate his buildings too. Because marriages are happy, the building owned by a married couple can be activated twice, there isn't any blocking involved as in other games which utilise the mechanism (at the time of writing, The Manhattan Project, Ora & Labora, Tournay). Tying everything up are mechanics to put meeples back on their feet so they can re-use the building again, constructing buildings, marrying, and having children.

Due to the simplicity of its 'market trees', Helvetia is an accessible game you are quickly able to play. The marriage aspect gives the worker placement a nice, recognisable subject without feeling overly artificial... Although it is kinda weird that a tired worker can still be married and have children—it's clear where their priorities lie! But that is really all there is to the game. There isn't any complex tricks to pull off—just grow your family, and work them buildings like crazy, taking another more creative route to victory is really not an option. On top of that it turns out that the nigh-indistinguishable male and female meeples really clutter the tiles with their photorealistic artwork, and you realise that don't actually [i]want[/i] to play this game for prolonged periods of time. For its less than ideal presentation the game gets deduction of one point.

What remains? A friendly economic game of happy Swiss worker placement suitable for families who want to have a game with meat on its bones without becoming too difficult. It's not my game, but in this genre there are certainly worse alternatives.

[b]Tip![/b] Having trouble with the clutter? Agree with the other players to have all males face in E-W direction, and all females in N-S direction, putting them in different corners of a tile. Don't put the tiles close together either. This helps considerably in quickly scanning for marriage candidates as well as leaving open the important what-does-the-tile-do infographic. Alternatively, give the males a black hat or something, although you'll need to paint the pieces then, of course.

RATING: 6
I need to play again before making too many judgments, but it feels like an economic workerplacement game which has a scripted feel to it. Unlike Agricola which has the random cards, this game does not have that random element so I would expect the game to become stale after players devise the optimum strategy.

Confused me too much to be more enjoyable. Players race to have babies (more workers to place) and marry (get more actions), and so the board becomes a mess of wooden meeples covering up the various resource spaces. Furthermore, many of your pieces will be over in front of your opponents, so you will need to constantly be looking around to figure out how to turn x into y into z. 

Overall, I'd play it again for certain, but it's not more than a 6 at this point.

Helvetia is a perfectly competent little logistics game. I played it once and found it to be enjoyable enough for that one play, but see no reason to ever play it again. Any questions I had about the game were answered in that game, and all that would be left in future plays would be to see how successful you can be in managing the action selection mechanism and other player’s tableaus. While that is enough to make it so I would not actively oppose another play, it is not enough to make me want to play.

Players are a family, living in a Swiss village, just after the Napoleonic Wars.  Interesting game where players allocate their action coins to use one of the five characters in the village.  The builder constructs buildings; the nightwatchman makes noise and wakes up villagers; the trader sells goods to the market; the priest marries off your villagers; and the midwife makes babies!  Villagers are placed on buildings, making that their trade for the rest of the game - grow wheat, make cows, brew ale, and so on.  The idea is to form production chains to create products, and get them to the market for victory points - with bonuses going to the players who get their first.  You need more villagers to do more stuff, so babies happen, and interestingly, you can marry your villagers off into an opponent's village to make their stuff!  This creates fascinating synergies, because if you marry into an opponent's village, they can have more babies, and so on.  The game ends when someone crosses the 20 victory point threshold.

This is a very, very clever, interactive game.  The game looks beautiful, but unfortunately the villager pieces (men and women) look very similar across a table, and the building tiles while looking very nice, all look the same from a yard away (and you do need to constantly look at everything on the table, not just your stuff).  

Finally, and sadly, this fascinating game is very difficult to plan a strategy for, and simply isn't much fun.  As well all agreed - "it just felt like work".

Yet another village building game...  This one has quite a puzzle feel to it, as you need to figure out how to chain your resource transmutations across your own and other player's villages.   So, it's thinky.   It's also incentive-based, as you must send your people off to marry other player's meeples.   BTW, the male and female meeples could have been better differentiated.   And, the art, while nice, is not functional - especially the similarity and darkness of the icons.  Would play again, but don't need to own.   This is not a game that will have long shelf life.  Every game will feel the same.

This game has only 1 flaw - other players can deny you with weddings, which would slow you down a lot in the beginning.

The game is about collection more and more complex materials, and being the first one to produce them. Also, you get points for making chains, building a lot of buildings, etc. In all of that you need to be the fastest.

You are trying to make most weddings as soon as possible, and make children as soon as possible. But at the same time, you need to save a few for last rounds, so that you can be the last one who has "most weddings / most children" cards.

Also, you try to outsmart other players, because they have villagers in your village too, but their villagers are "refreshed" only when you choose "refresh" action. So you need to balance things out - either to use your villagers twice or more, while they don't get the chance, or to try denying them some of the materials (which denies yourself too).

Don't see why this game is so low on the list. It was fun to me, even if other players tried to use dirty tactics on me (I explained it on top). I won the game nevertheless. Doing "your stuff" in this game is more important than trying to "screw" other players.

Would play it anytime.

2016-05-31 : An engine building game that takes a bit too long to ramp up and then ends very quickly. Do not play this with AP prone gamers. Does take the title of most fun game during the rules explanation though as 2 people got the giggles when I explained the rules regarding marriage and having babies.  Layout and graphics are fine but the meeples are a bit too big, thereby obscuring the view of other people's village tiles, which you need to be able to see clearly from across the table. Not a bad game, but my least favourite of the Matthias Cramer games.

A clever little game that felt quite fresh for a few plays. It's an action chaining game with a very close finish line. Getting to the necessary 20 points is slow at first but then happens very quickly from about 12 points on, so it's all about who can convert points the fastest. You chain different workers together to produce primary, secondary, and tertiary goods, and have to spend an action to refresh your sleeping (used) workers. You marry your workers with other people's workers and have babies, but spend too much time doing that and the race will end before you've run it.

No real interaction in the game but rather just trying to outrun each other by claiming bonuses and grabbing buildings in this sprint of a game. I thought it played very well with 2P. I eventually traded it as it felt explored after 7 plays.

After seeing the game again i still feel that the good looking board could show the information more clearly.
- make better combo's with the bonus tiles
- focus on bonusses
- marry and make kids early on.

Helvetia provides a fresh perspective on worker placement with a couple of twists to tried and true mechanics. Having to marry your village members to those of other players in order to exploit their buildings is the most prominent of those twists, but there are unusual differences in other parts as well, e.g. the way action selection works.

Where Helvetia doesn't differ at all from the bulk of the genre is how you score points, despite all those innovative touches. You need to produce resources and either sell them directly for points or use them to construct buildings that will hopefully help you to do more of that later. Often, basic resources need to be converted to higher-level products first, e.g. grain to bread. Those production chains can sometimes become long enough to lead to mild forms of AP. In the end, most of the tension in the game is based on timing your actions to be faster than your opponents which feels a little one-sided: be the first to construct a valuable building, be the first to deliver a set of products, be the first to marry that highly useful (um, respected) bell founder. That's where the rewards are.

The game components of the first edition are a tad problematic, with meeples of the two sexes barely distinguishable and resource icons not easily recognisable, mostly because they are simply too dark.

Interesting little game. Heavier than it seems at first.
Nice engine building mechanism that interlocs with other's villages in a very cool way.
But 2 turns needed to make your workers do anything in your village is a bit too long, cosidering that in a 3 player game you may become an old maid or old bachelor's only village.
I like the concept of the marriages a lot.

At the same time pro and con is situation in the game - constantly changing make the game very dinamic and hard to manage.

Plays well, interesting mechanics, tied well to theme.  Its only problem is the very crowded field it is playing in.  Some graphic decisions look rushed - males and females far too hard to distinguish - my males now all sport hats. The artist has rendered the commodities lifelike, at the expense of making it difficult to see what each house produces.  However Cramer is on a roll.

Complex: medium, caught on teh first turns, but many concepts to take into account
Weight: medium- heavy
Players: 3
Length: around 1 hour
Opinion: do not be fooled about the length of the game, it is a brain burner game. You need players ready to be looking at other players boards and to know what others are doing. The worker placement is nice, you place several workers at the same time in one of the options. How the marriage works keep the interaction high and the downtime low, although A/P could appear depending on the players. There several ways of gaining VP's and they are well connected.
Also like how the resources are produced. You have to keep in mind and time well where and when to marriage, and to whom, as well as the people you need for your own village

RATING: 7.5
Am I biased because of the theme? Hopefully not. But still I like the game quite much because it's a
 worker placement game with a twist. The twist are the workers itself as they are male and female. To gather some resources you must marry them into foreign villages. All in all mechanics are known (worker placement / resource allocation / role selection) but this mix offers enough new tactical and strategic challenges that the game is worth to be looked at. The only downside is "overview". The pawns are too big (cover to much space) and are not easily distinguishable if male or female. You'd better use some Carcassonne Meeples at least for one gender. Players end up with very few points difference at the end, so every victory point counts.

RATING: 8
I did not really like Glen More or Lancaster, but I loved Helvetia.  It has a nice mesh of systems and a beautiful look.  My slight issues are that it can take time to plan your move and you need to see what tiles your family members are on within other peoples' cities, so it is best to stand up and look around.  Kosmos has announced a fix for those who cannot tell the men from the women, but it was not that hard.  It is not Duck Dealer or Neuland, but if you like that chaining of actions, definitely give Helvetia a try.

RATING: 7.5
A very interesting eurogame design, all about choosing actions and using up and refreshing permanent workers in order to build buildings and deliver goods. Thematically it's kind of weirdly stereotypical, but the mechanics are interesting. I especially like the tension of not knowing whether someone is going to end the round before you finish your actions or claim the bonus tile you were aiming for. I also like that you have to think at least two turns ahead to make sure you have enough workers to fill your new buildings, and the way players are encouraged to marry into each other's villages.

Another spreadsheet resource management game, but with a twist! Your resources are bonded (ahem, mated) with other villages' villagers, and blocking seems to be an essential part of the game. It's these unique features that I like about the game. The game also insists on using no text... but it needs text because there's a lot of rules that you need to know that cannot simply be explained. I'm not talking about basic mechanics about how the game works, but little errata type nuances like "in this one exception, you can't do that or do this". I always hate unnecessary errata as it shows that the game cannot run on its own wheels.

There's still a fun amount of depth to it.

A lovely game. While the theme is somewhat light, the mechanics are a wonderful masterpiece. Production of simple and chained goods, waking up parts of a village, marring into other villages all part of a great cohesion that make up a great game. Building up a village in the correct way to have is part of the puzzle as well.
It is essentially a race game, who will be the first to grab the bonus points, first to the finish line so it can be a bit chaotic.
For me the biggest drawback is that this game is not the same with just 2 players.

I got the game with intention to pass it on and so I did. So I hope that it will be more appreciated than it would have been with me. I think this a game that would like to revisit again some time later.

Muy buen juego. Aunque se puede hacer un poco lioso, lo ir mirando los pueblos del resto de jugadores para ver que acciones tienen disponibles. Si tienes niños o niñas, donde casarte...

Very good game. Although you can get a little messy, so be looking the villages of other players to see what actions are available. Decisions... What is better? To have a boy or a girl, where they get married ... (By the way the sex of the child should not be random?) A Game prone to high doses of AP. I love the cover of the game! The Matterhorn is the most beautiful mountain on Earth.

Con tan sólo cinco acciones diferentes, Cramer genera una especie de carrera al mejor de 20 PV´s para lograr las losetas de Bonus. Las mecánicas básicas no son nuevas: construyes edificios, los situas en tu despliegue, los usas con tus trabajadores, activas de nuevo a los trabajadores... Nada particularmente emocionante. Sin embargo la mecánica de las bodas (conseguirás usar edificios de los contrarios) y la de mayorías (para lograr acciones extras) me parecen muy buenos aportes. PROS: más interacción de lo habitual. CONS: Necesitas tres turnos para usar un edificio propio, lo que dificulta cambiar de estrategia rápidamente cuándo necesites hacerlo. Fomenta el AP. Es el típico juego que te gustaría jugar de nuevo pero que no hace falta tenerlo.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (April 2014)

What a surprise game. I’m now official a fan of Mr. Matthias Cramer (I also dig Glen More and Rococo). I really liked Helvetia. It has many facets I enjoy, namely: easy rules, great components, fast gameplay with low downtime, lots of player interaction and (most important for me) very interesting decisions (where to play, how many action discs, what resources to use, from which quadrant) with controlled (low) luck. Love the marriage action (male, female, child meeples) and the spatial aspect of the game (where to build).

I’m not sure what the theme is supposed to be as the game explainer never said, I will read the rules soon HOWEVER I felt I was building a town and competing for resources, not sure if the theme correspond with the game mechanics but as I love Euros I don’t really care about this.

I minor dislike for me is that Helvetia plays anti clock wise :D. That causes some planning mistakes for some players (me included) as we have the clock wise direction very ingrained in our gamer minds. Also we had some trouble differentiating the male and female meeples.

Bottom line, Helvetia is a game I enjoy a lot. I will probably buy it this week. It’s a shame it is so expensive in USA. Probably can go higher in my personal ratings.

One of 2011´s favorites.

Games featuring marrying and getting offspring seem to be 2011's second thematic hype right after games featuring the composition of an exhibition. While the more complex MIL(1049) deterred me with its confusing cube handling, Helvetia hits a nice balance between a gamer's game and a family game which can be expected for a Kosmos release. 
It's main mechanism is action selection. The available actions are build, produce, reactivate workers, marry and get children. Each round, the player who has selected an action the most, gets a bonus chip, that allows him to execute this action the next round for free once. To get points, players have to build production buildings, deliver products and towards the end build victory point buildings. In between, bonuses are awarded for reaching various achievements first.
After one game, players should have grasped the game and have a better idea when to make the crucial decision of switching from production to VP buildings. Until this point, there's enough decisions to be made. The most interesting one is the tradeoff between marrying your offspring to other players or employing them in your own village. A good game that I like better than the author's previous release Lancaster. I don't get why some players complain about the cover. For me, it's a pleasant diversion from the usually cartoony covers and makes the game more attractive.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Definitely a well-made game.  Weirdly abstract cover (though definitely preferable to the standard Eurogame cover art) with very little to say about the theme of the game, except for that it's set in Switzerland.  I'm not sure how much we as Americans know about the Swiss and their history and culture, so a lot is definitely lost in translation.

The game is perfectly cromulent, but not particularly exciting.  I would like it to play faster - as a 45 minute game it would be a lot more attractive.  It is also kind of ridiculous how similar they made the male and female pawns.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Has some interesting dynamics and player interactions, as you can essentially "coattail" on what other folks have built by marrying in. On the other hand, you're dependent on them coming into your village to bring in more workers into the game via marriage and children.

Those mechanics are interesting to me, less so are the piecemeal points here and there and some of the small jockeying for positions.

Solid game, no real interest in owning.

I find this game a little bit oddly anti-gay. Don't laugh. Here's the thing - you can play a woman blacksmith or miner or whatever, and women can do plenty of things in-game that they never could have done in actual 18th century life, and yet a major mechanic forbids gay people. What gives? It's fine to to have everyone pairing off two by two whether they want to or not, I guess, but grouping people in some other means than boy-girl would've been too much effort? Blech.

OK, so now that I've gotten *that* out of my system... the game provides an interlocking system of marriages and jobs. It's remarkable in that you get a feel for how arid, caste-based and horrible 19th century life was in Switzerland. If you start mining ore, you can never leave! Same with doing anything else: being a baker, or a tin smith, or whatever...

Look, I can't write a nice comment on Helvetia. The game itself is fine, it's really good looking and provides interesting gameplay and many people will find it fun, but I just find it depressing, OK? Just ignore me...

2012-Apr 29 1st play: Quite fun - loved the marriage mechanic. The first game was pretty fiddly, lots of rule-reading, stops and starts while we figured it out. Expecting the second game to go much more smoothly. Very much enjoyed the production without resource hoarding. Downsides: Rules are vague on some spots, meeples very hard to tell apart (yay hats), blue meeples downright unusable (too dark to see hats), and marketplace compass rose was confusing (or maybe it's me). Looking forward to the next game!

RATING: 7.6
The basics are just like in every second recent Euros: buy building tiles, place them in your display, use them with your men, then activate your men again etc.; also the first deck is full of resources and the third deck is full of buildings that give you victory points - just the usual stuff, quite simplified to make it a family game (which is a positive in my eyes).
The differences are nice: marriage with other villagers in other villages to be able to use their buildings and to take action markers from them; genre control; activating whole village quarters thus activating other players' villagers as well. Nice ideas, good implementation. I have slight issues only with the production values: blue meeple are a bit too dark; the illustration on the tiles is also a bit dark; female and male pawns are a bit hard to differentiate. Otherwise I'm happy I bought this one.

An engine building and running game with limited depth and a flash but ultimately forgettable marrying mechanic.  Gameplay is fairly linear despite the various production paths and replayability feels low.  The scope and options just seem too limited / unimportant.  I really liked the art but that's not enough.

RATING: 6
Reminds me quite a bit of Neuland except everyone has their own player board and turn order is consistent going counterclockwise.  Choose your marriages wisely to be able to acquire the goods you need and ideally try to bunch your married dudes together in one quadrant in the other villages in case you need to wake them up to take more actions and others aren't disposed to assist!  This one is definitely much more of a puzzle which the person who figures out the best and quickest path will win - however, other people can mess with your plan by beating you to a good, etc which may prevent a bonus VP.  The male/female meeples look way too much alike which caused some difficulty.  Curious to give this one another play but I am not sure about the legs on this one.

One of the most interesting worker placement games I've ever seen. The game feels very compact because the game mechanics are minimalistically implemented. Nevertheless, the theme is aligned seamlessly. Getting your people married in your opponents villages is a very original way to introduce interaction in this game.

Some people tell me they find Helvetia too much clutter, difficult to see your options. But for me that is part of the game. This game forces you to take good attention, not only by looking at your own village, but also at the other players villages. In that respect, the small difference between male and female figures could be seen as a feature of the game, instead of a flaw.

This is a game for people that are good at overseeing their options quickly, and enjoy a strong theme with funny twists, while making intelligent decisions in an intuitive way.

Can be played with 2 but I wouldn't recommend it.

RATING: 7
This appears to be quite a strategic game instead of just a family game, although both the publisher and the nostalgic illustrations could have me fooled. Going for a peak value and not a steady accumulation of victory points is helpful in overturning the usual Euro dynamics, but what appealed to me the most is the interaction the comes from having a lot of your villagers (aka meeples) marry into the villages of the other players, where they can use building abilities just as well as the aborigines.

Two differences to having them reside in your home village drive a lot of the strategies in the game: First, the blessed fruits of marital union (aka more meeples) belong to their birth village, no matter the origin of their parents. Second, when a villager does something useful except for marrying and conceiving, the healthy mountain air makes him fall asleep until the Nightwatch wakes him up again. And since you can only send the Nightwatch on his round in your own village, meeples in other villages can be effectively hijacked by not waking them up, ever. Which is a very effective thing to do if they would otherwise provide an action that is crucial to your long-term plans.

Since my shelves are a bit overcrowded in the mid-heavy Euro department, I’m not likely to buy this, but I’d gladly play again and can recommend it to anyone who is looking for something like Thurn and Taxis with more depth.

Very good worker placement game in which you have to marry some of your workers with other players' workers in order to be able to get their resources. There's a lot of strategies to win. This game is not light (which, for me, is a plus).

If we played regularly with more than two, this game would have been a keeper. We just didn't like the dummy player. My husband also didn't like that the "bonus action" tiles that you got for earning majorities could be taken away. I have great respect for the design of Helvetia. It's so unique the way your workers marry into other players' towns. It just didn't click with us the way we wished it would.

Helvetia truly has a unique feel. It's only of those games that is thematic even if you don't understand the setting (that is, 19th century Switzerland). You definitely need a few plays under your belt before you can sense whether you like it or not. It's not that it's heavy; it's simply that it's different. 

By the way, it plays great with 2!

RATING: 7
An enjoyable worker placement cum action selection game with some interesting twists on the usual mechanisms. 

The gist:

You are the head of a family in early 19th century Switzerland. You develop your own village by building buildings and marrying off your sons and daughters to other villages so they can work the resource producing buildings there. 

The manner and order in which you select your actions can have a profound effect on victory point calculations, which are done at the end of every round. 

Looking forward to playing this again.

Good euro, deeper and harder than I thought when listening to the rules explanation. I dislike that information on each player's town results constantly hidden by too many meeples making difficult to check what resourses are available. I absolutely prefer games with exclusive player areas and/or a common one, but additional two or three -hard to see- play areas and all that stuff to keep track of wasn't very enjoyable for me; anyhow I think after a couple plays I'd get used to it, since the size and graphics of the icons are appropiate. Bottomline, I liked the theme and the atmosphere created by marriages mechanism, want to play again.

Switzerland => Theme is great 
The game is a mixture between Neuland and LeHavre with some marriages and births tossed in. Both are games where I´m not a fan.  
But the real most difficult part are the German rules with examples without use or some strange interpretation options. A simple example for the Fuhrmann how to get the complicated goods would be very useful.Not my type of game I like but I´m still a hige an of Matthias Cramers other games

This is a pretty cool worker placement game. The theme is fun, marrying with other villages to get more recource spaces. The game takes two plays to get used to, the rules are not complex but a little unusual.

I recommend trying it if you can track down a copy.

It was nice enough, and there were things we liked about it but it just isn't quite good enough to keep it around. I like the limited actions and the way you can try to strand your opponent with a bunch of unspent actions. I like the role selection mechanism. The artwork is nice. 

The goods and buildings tend to feel samey to me, and it briefly gave me that yucky feeling I had with Homesteaders: the "I have so many different goods I can spend and so many (slightly) different buildings I could build and I don't care about any of them." I felt a little flustered and overwhelmed. 

It was nice enough and had some good things going on, but I realized I wasn't having fun with it. Kat echoed the sentiments.

Gioco che devo approfondire. Dopo i primi contatti mi ha dato l'idea di un giochino poco originale e un po' arido. Nella Confederazione Elvetica stiamo facendo rinascere il nostro villaggio dopo il dominio Napoleonico. Ogni capo villaggio organizzarà le varie attività di ricostruzione, allargamento città ma anche aumento di popolazione grazie a nuove nascite ma anche a matrimoni con cittadini di villaggi adiacenti (di altri giocatori). In sostanza è un piazzamento lavoratori e gestione risorse. Da riprovare per comprenderne meglio le varie opportunità. Gioco che ha il grave difetto di non divertirmi.

More of a logistical exercise than a game, reminiscent of Neuland. Some potentially alarming kingmaker problems and an action-selection mechanic that lacks urgency are part of the problem, and there's a brute-force approach where Glen More had subtle variety. Not for me, I'm afraid.

Pretty bland worker placement Euro with all the standard options and no link to theme. Use workers to generate more workers, to generate goods, to build buildings which generate higher brands of goods, get more workers, place on better buildings to get better goods, use workers to generate goods and send to market, score points, get more points for better goods. Repeat until someone gets to 20 points. While it was fine for one playing, there's not nearly enough variety within the game to offer much replay value, just doing the same thing again. One and done.

1st play interesting. Enough to tell I prefer it over Glen More, but I really don't like Glen More. 

The way you can convert goods to convert goods to convert is interesting. Your success is very reliant on being aware of what is going on in each and every opponent's tableau as well as yours, at all times. 

But in the end, this feels more like a chore than enjoyment to me.

Helvetia is an excellent game. Every decision is important for your next turn. The system of marrieing into other villages is very interesting. The Rating of only 8 is because of a 3 player game in which a player built his village not attractive enough for the other players. With that he shoot himself out of the game in the third round and the rest of the game was boring for him. I don't understand why Kosmos does't decide to add a 5th player to Helvetia.

Can't give a rating yet, because we tried this twice. The first time we played it absolutely wrong. The second time I am still not sure if we did everything right. It felt very fiddly and difficult to figure out what's going on. The pieces are difficult to distinguish. The gameplay itself is nothing new. The theme is great! For me these rules are really bad written. I have to learn if that's only me having this difficulty.
Update: played it again yesterday. Now it begins to click with me. It makes sense and knowing that a game should last about 5-7 rounds was helping alot. I like the theme and the jockeying for victorypoints on different places of the game. The part about making babies and raising them makes for a lot tabletalk, but the game itself still feels like an euro and the interaction is not very high. Fine game! I am wondering if this game will grow on me more over time, I still feel the urge to play this again.
Update: Played it again with the right rules and it starts to click! We had a lots of fun! This is definitely a Euro.

Cramer is always one to incorporate some new and interesting mechanics into his games, and Helvetia is no exception.  Here, he's created a very interactive game by allowing players to "marry into" other player's clans, and thus use the buildings they've purchased.  However, this allows those players to have children, giving them more pawns to work with.  The resource production mechanic is somewhat reminiscent of Neuland in that you have to use workers at a chain of buildings in order to get the final product.  Unfortunately, there are a few issues, namely that the male pawns are difficult to distinguish from the female pawns, and it's very easy to unintentionally screw players at the end, possibly creating king-making situations.

A medium-weight worker placement board game, where the objective is to build a small swiss village and deliver goods to the big city. The core mechanism is not very hard to explain, as similar mechanisms can be found in other games; there are also a few original concepts, e.g., workers fall to sleep after producing goods and the players should wake them up.

It features a swiss theme that integrates nicely into the game, as players have to produce and deliver cows, cheese, butter and other traditional swiss goods. The artwork is brilliant and makes the game suitable for family gaming.

I would recommend it as a "main" game, since it's a bit slow paced for a euro game and can go up to 90 minutes.

In this game, players manage their own little towns. You race to get to 20+ points to end the game before other players are ready. Some points you get for shipping goods, others you get for being the first to accomplish something, and some points are handed back and forth when a majority changes. The unique thing about this game is the way players rely on each other. You can marry your workers off to other player's boards, which gives them the opportunity to have babies, eventually getting them more workers, and gives you the opportunity to use their building tiles for yourself. The game makes it so you'll need to rely on what other people have, and the whole thing works out to be a confusing efficiency puzzle that's more interesting in theory than in practice.

Such a unique worker placement game. Very innovative and fun. It took me a little a while to unlearn certain mechanics I had grown to expect from a game like this, but once I did it was a very enjoyable experience.

The strategy in Helvetia can be very subtle. Knowing when to use all of your discs or hold out for the first player token is very important. A surprising amount of player interaction involved.

The scoring mechanics seem to have been tuned to perfection, so if you're playing with the right crowd it will always be a tight race to the finish.

Another of those games that give you an unique feeling. Great original mechanics, only surpassed by theme. Run a farm, marry into other families, produce butter, cheese and other farm products through a chain - need hay to have cows and cows to produce butter, but you can also turn your cows into meat... - and using buildings you have on your farm or from another farm where one of your family members married into. Very well done and works very well.

Jogo muito interessante e bastante diferente dos demais, começando pela arte da caixa - encantadora de tão simples, continuando nas mecânicas, passando pelas personagens que dão acções de borla - fora do tempo, e terminando na tabela de pontos flutuante, onde cada ponto é um sofrimento, já que em Helvetia, pontos são coisa rara... É bastante complexo, mas como não tem DL, o tempo até passa sem se sentir muito. Recomendo!

RATING: 8.3
A very satisfying unique spin on worker placement by embedding an area control mechanic.  Additionally, it might be the only game I can think of that uses marriage and gender as a important factors in to formulate a successful strategy.  There is a real nice balance between village construction, population expansion and resource delivery at the market.  With all the various mechanic and paths to pursue, it can be lost that the true objective is a race to get 20 points so one must remain focus on this goal.

Same designer as Glen More and Lancaster.
You have a village tile, surrounded by buildings and populated with men and women. Some are single, some are couples.
The people are tipped over to produce resources, enabling you to move goods, make babies, build buildings or populate other buildings.

Buildings and moving goods get you victory points. Being the first to move some goods or blocks of goods can get you bonuses, as can being a prolific builder.
You can marry your progeny off to other peoples villagers to be able to use their resources and to give yourself more actions.
There are 5 roles to pick each turn to let you do one type of action and bonus actions for those who use one the most.
There's a lot going on here and much to think about.
One of the two best games I got to play this past weekend.

RATING: 6
An engine development game where some of the engine is on other player's boards and accessible only via marriage.  No confrontation between players (other than denying them marriage opportunities or buildings); a game in efficiency of action conversion to points as the first to 20 wins the game.  One can build buildings, but to staff them, one needs couples to have babies who attend school next round before being available to operate the building.  The game emphasizes a solid foundation upon which is built the necessary production chains for the final push for points to victory.

Plays very quickly (90 minutes) so a plus in that regard.

RATING: 6
I find Glen More more enjoyable. This has too much of "important cards that you use to turn X into Y are spread among all the player's tableaus and you need to remember or re-find them" that I am not fond of, but Helvetia is moderate compared to extreme cases like Le Havre. So it's a playable potentially enjoyable version of such a game for me.

But the physical implementation is really bad:

1. The resource icons are not sufficiently different looking. Especially the brick and wood (which both have a sort of rectangular grid symbology) are way too similar.

2. The male and female meeples are way too similar.

3. The center double-sized tile of villages looks too indistinguishable from the "real" tiles.

Many people we played with all agreed that these physical problems made the game needlessly harder to play.

Also the 2-player version looked sufficiently unappealing to us (having to set up a dummy 3rd village, with a whole page of rule changes for 2 players) that we didn't even bother trying it... :/

It seems probably a fine game of its sort, but the lousy physical issues and the unappealing 2-player rules make me rate it a bit lower than I might otherwise.

I like the overall game here.  Run your village, while sending your single men and women into neighboring villages to marry and give you access to a variety of goods or services.  

Worker placement and role selection in a subtle mix.  It's crucial to plan your procreation correctly and just as important not to get screwed by others using up actions while you try to stockpile.

Great Euro if your in the mood for it.

My favorite game of 2011 I think. Doesn't stand out from other resource production/consumption games on a first glance, but is quite rewarding. Similarly to Puerto Rico, doesn't like mixing experienced players with new ones - if you act after a newbie, you will win. If you have a constant group and like Puerto Rico, give it a try - although the games have completely different mechanics, they both involving acting so as to profit as much as possible without making it easy for other players and racing to be first to accomplish something. It's quick, three player games (best number) last just over an hour and is perfect for finishing a game night - not as deep as Caylus, but still offers pleasant brain burning.

Neat game! A bit hard to learn on BSW, but game play seems pretty straightforward. It uses the production system I first saw in Neuland, which is interesting but seems like it might be a bit challenging playing in real life (keeping track of what you can produce, since everything is scattered amongst all players' villages). Maybe better online?

Some good ideas in this game but I would rather want a game that could be faster to develop instead of wasting half of it not playing but simply waiting for the outcome of my own actions. A waste of time in so many levels. One simple rule would change this but, then again, maybe the designer wants it as it is and there's nothing wrong about that. It's just that I don't like it!

This is a really interesting mix of worker placement and area majority.

There are 5 actions available for worker placement and you can take the same actions multiple times. At the end of a round whoever has the most workers on each action will get a victory point and will get a bonus action of that type for the next round. While the VP (which can be lost later if another player gets majority on that action) is more important during later parts of the game the bonus action can be a huge boost for the next turn.

Another interesting point about this game is how emphasised player interaction is. Beside the obvious struggle for majorities you have to constantly think which gender you want your next children to be to keep your options for marriage open, so you constantly check what other players have available in their village and what gender the townsfolk running the resource building is.
Added to that all players have the same common pool of buildings to build and taking one from another player can be all the difference.
And last but by far not least the players can place multiple workers on the same action in one of their turns and the round end once only one player has workers left - so someone will not be able to place all their workers (though they do get first player token for the next round - and that is also a VP), so the decision to split up workers between multiple turns or just plopping a lot of them on the same action (even if that action is slightly worse as if you would split them) is very important you always have to consider other players just dumping all workers and suddenly you don't get another turn.

The reason this isn't even higher for me (though 7 is a high grade) is taht this game causes some AP in me (hopefully not terribly bad), which causes me to be slightly stressed while playing since I know I should occasionally decide faster (and I try to push myself). I can easily see this grade going higher once I get more used to the game and the decisions will be a little more clear.

Cramer - interested. Now owned, very nicely produced and the box stands out (to put it mildly!) on the games shelf.

From a rules read through I like the look of the building placement rules and how your workers get on the board. The rest might be a bit too generic goods conversion/deliver and grab Vps. Hopefully the mechanics provide enough of a twist to make this an entertaining game

Based on one play this has great mechanics which go into a slightly boring goods co version vp race

A rather inspired worker placement game, where worker placement takes place on two levels: picking actions with your action disks an placing family members on different buildings. The marrying mechanism creates some interesting choices, and makes it very important to keep track of the buildings erected by other players.

I'm not sure quite what I think about Helvetia. I understand the comments that it's just more worker placement and more resource conversion, but each of these elements is just off-beat enough to keep things interesting -- it's "just another soulless euro" beamed in from an alternate universe where Switzerland rules the Earth.

There seems to be plenty of scope for different strategies (delivery bonuses, VP buildings etc.), and very fun timing games around spending multiple actions at once, and balancing acquisition of (powerful!) bonus tiles against multiple actions. Marriage provides opportunities for leeching strategies. Interesting.

Overly complicated mechanisms that seem very arbitrary. The game is fairly fiddly and having to look over at the other people's tableau to remember your actions is annoying. The first few turns seem extremely scripted (get more works by having kids ASAP) and the whole convert one good to another to another to score points is pretty boring. Did not feel fun at all. There were some interesting decisions (like the last person with workers doesn't get to use them) which makes the game not a complete waste, but if I'm going to play a worker placement game it would be something else.

New mechanics work great and the theme is fresh and interesting and nicely implemented.

It's extremely AP-prone though and the components, while high quality, do add to the confusion - men look pretty much like women for example.

Very interesting game where your meeples get married and move over to your opponents villages. Another action grants the married couples a baby, who have to go to school before they can be married or come home to work. This creates a very unique feeling flow on how to get more workers. Besides that, the game is mostly about creating chains of virtual resources to create complex good and gain points. There are bonus tiles that everyone races towards that award extra points. Really cool and different game.

I'm not sure what I expected Helvetia to be; I was vaguely aware of the marrying aspect but nothing much beyond that.

It turned out to be a clever, if slightly frustrating and analytical game of building and running chains of production. I enjoyed it, but not in the way I'd expected to.

The marrying off of 'children' requires a little planning and I'm sure that there are depths hidden in here that experienced players can really manipulate to their advantage. I think, like Nauticus recently, this is the kind of game I enjoy a lot more with somewhat inexperienced players and I don't think I'd really want to play this with players that were really going to think through every action and be perfectly efficient.

Euro game that somehow has a unique feel to it, even though it's about role selection, buildings and delivering goods to the market. There are many small twists to make this game stand out different.

Theme is cosy, developing an Alp village. There is player interaction, but it's not vicious.

The cover and name might have you thinking trivia game, but Matthias Cramer has something else in mind for you in Helvetia.

You and your fellow players run small but busy mountain villages in the Swiss Alps where you work, build and trade. But life isn't only about work. Your village baker longs for a partner, and the farmer's son has his eye on the dashing woodcutter in the neighboring village.
So let the wedding bells ring and marry off that farmer's son in the village of another player, thereby earning you additional income. And surely your village baker will find a man from a neighboring village to move in with her. Before you know it, their offspring will be new citizens in your village.
Your goal in Helvetia is to build new homes, bring culture to your village, and sell essential goods at market. Whatever strategy you choose, this village life won't be boring – especially in the villages that grow and thrive!

Gorgeous art, and very pleasing game play. Marrying your workers off into the other player's boards is very interesting, as you gain access to things you don't otherwise have, and can then save actions if they make certain moves which wake up your workers for free. With all resources having to be used immediately, it makes for some challenging coordination to get everything to work properly.

On the surface, Helvetia shares similarities with any game that has players building specialist buildings to produce goods, however I feel like the marriage and child-birthing mechanics are enough to change up the way the game plays. Couples in players' villages can have children, and when they 'grow up' next turn, they can be married into other players' villages if they have single folks tending a building. This is how you get to produce goods that you can't provide in your own village.

It's not as crunchy as something like Agricola or Myrmes, but it's pretty tight nonetheless. Scoring is continually adjusted depending on round results and I like it as a nice alternative to straight-up VP accumulation.

Really beautiful game that I really wanted to like, but its fiddliness really detracts from the game.  The male/female pieces are added complexity that don't really add to the game (see Stone Age for neutered villagers having babies . . .). The scoring is a pain - having to effectively recount every turn.  Finally, the production model is also fiddly - turn water into beer into whatever that you deliver, but make sure all the villagers are put to sleep, etc.

Not a bad game, but just not as good as a lot of others.

In Helevtia, each player starts with some basic buildings and a couple of men and women. They use these men and women to occupy the buildings so the buildings produce goods. These goods can be used to purchase better buildings, which can be used to produce better goods, which can be used to buy VP’s. Sounds familiar? Sounds like just another worker placement game? Yes, you’re right, it does and it is. But what makes Helvetia different, is the fact that your meeples (men and women, remember?), can marry with a meeple of the opposite sex of another player and that way, use the other players building. That way, you won’t have to build all of the buildings yourself in your tiny village. The other thing, is that when meeples are maried, they can have children. First children goes to school (they are very smart, because education will take one round only), before they become adult and can work in your (or another player’s) town.

This last twist in use of the meeples makes the game very interactive and different then other worker placement games. Too bad, it is only available in German. If it was published in more languages, this would become a big hit.

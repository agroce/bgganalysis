Solid quick and easy to play/teach card game. My gaming group has instantly accepted it into the mix. I'm looking forward to the Live Stocked and Loaded expansion, I got to play it with the designer and publisher last month and its going to add a lot to this already great game.

I've played this game probably half a dozen times since getting it. I bought a copy pre-kickstarter and I helped kickstart it. The game changed slightly from the versions but still held true to the 'take-that' mechanic which in the end seems to have worked against the enjoyment of the game rather than for it. I wouldn't turn a game of it down if I were available, but it's not a game I bring out often either.

(KIDS) This seems like a very chaotic game that I can't see lasting very long... not even playing with my 6 and 8 year old kids.  They enjoyed it okay, but it's mostly just a matter of destroying everything around you while trying to, somehow, harvest a few crops.

Second play confirmed my feeling after the first one.  It's largely a game of doing as little as possible until you can steal and harvest others' crops.  It makes for little to no planning and way too much chaos.

Great artwork though!

RATING: 6
The art is great and it's a fun little game, but overall I'd say it's a "family" game, with the positives and negatives that implies. The main advantages are speed of play and teaching and the high portability, none of which are to be sneezed at. However, we got tired of the game pretty quickly because it's just not very deep. Games are heavily luck driven, and it's easy to get stuck in a situation where you can't plant anything for a few turns, which won't necessarily lose you the game but is hugely frustrating.

Pretty good game after a few rules revisions; the farm fresh edition is a fun product. Timing was good for a casual game and it becomes pretty easy to follow after one or two rounds. My first game I lost 24-32, the second game (against the same person) I lost 53-57. The game is very sensitive to small differences in skill or luck.

Caveat: I have not yet tried it with more than two players. Not sure how the downtime would be.

In Farmageddon, each player is attempting to plant and harvest the most profitable crop as fast as possible before the other players steal or destroy their planted fields. Players must be offensive and defensive at all times. Failure to do so will most certainly make them a target. Great for families, little geeks, and non-gamers, Farmageddon is going to be a blast. For the hardcore Gamer Geeks, bring a sandwich because this game is going to leave you wanting a bit more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a very light 30-minute, chaotic "take-that" game, not to be played too seriously.  It feels like all of your plans are mowed over between turns - it's almost a miracle when your opponents leave you alone long enough that you can successfully finish what you started.  The artwork is cute, and it's pretty easy to explain and not a bad filler to pull out at the end of a game night, but there are so many better ones.

Played this twice with 2 and 3 players. Couldn't get into the game all that much. The artwork is very amusing and great to look at, but the nature of "take that" style play didn't grab any of us playing. Its major flaw, is that there seems to be no advantage to playing any crops yourself. As we played, we realized that it is impossible to ever harvest a crop on the turn you plant it, which means that they are fair game for all the other players. In all games I don't think we had a single crop scored that wasn't stolen from an opponent. This caused the game to grind to a halt when no one chose to play any new crops, instead only wanting to steal opponent's crops. Not worth the money I paid on TGC for it.

Played it a few times this year while at KublaCon. Each game was quick and easy to learn, and the combos got incredibly thinky along the way. From just planting simple crops, to going for the massive high-point ones, you start thinking what can be done to achieve your end-goal in the most efficient way. Saw some of the more ridiculous combos with the higher-point veggies.

The farmer cards keep the gameplay changing in a good way, constantly changing the environment in which your plants must survive after everyone else's turn before you can harvest. The special franken-plants also add a nice twist.

The artwork in the Farm Fresh Edition is gorgeous, and visually kept me in the theme. Kudos to the iconography as well.

There's enough game here to not only work on your own gardening strategy, but to constantly observe everyone else's garden, forcing you to contemplate your hand management and figure out whether you should spend the cards required to mess with your opponents, or save them in the hopes that they'll give you enough fertilizer to harvest your own garden...IF it survives.

Fun, light little card game with a very heavy TAKE THAT element:)...While there is some luck with cards drawn, there is some real strategy/tactics that can be used in playing the game and some definite combos with the action cards.  I will say that your hand can get rather large if you're not playing your 2 action cards every round (and you probably won't want to every round).  I think by the end of my first game, I had about 10 action cards in my hand in addition to my crop cards (although the crop cards are usually used pretty quickly). My 8 year old son caught on pretty quickly and wound up tying me for the victory in our first game. I'm really hoping this game can take the place of Monopoly Deal card game with my nephews:)...

A good combination of a little strategy and some randomness for good measure. Not a "main course" game, but a solid one to play between those epic Euro strategy games on game night. Oh, and some take-that.

The keys to the game are managing your crop cards (they fuel everything!), knowing which crops to plant, and when, and playing the right Action cards at the right time. There is a subtle amount of strategy that makes this more interesting than a haymaker fest like you see in some "take that" card games. 

Again, I'm completely biased, but I believe we have outstanding art that holds up to almost any game. 

(Disclaimer: Yes, I designed it, but I do have fun playing it! I've spent over a year on the game now constantly testing and refining it. It's really come a long way and I'm thrilled 5th Street Games picked it up for publication.)

Hm. Another games with individual text on cards. Just not my style. While the artwork isn't bad at all, it still felt abstract to me. There was no long-term strategy of any sort. That said, I had a certain amount of fun - and my wife (who beat me by quite a margin, despite claiming she's terrible with plants) liked it more than me. So it might see more plays.

The person who taught this compared it to Munchkin and called it a take-that game, neither of which I particularly like.  Plus, it has a silly theme, and while I like silly themes I find that, unfortunately, games with silly themes usually suck.  So really, I was surprised that I didn't hate this.  I could see in just the wrong circumstances how it might suck, but it didn't the time I played it.

I found the game very reminiscent of FF's [gameid=312], which I think does a better job.  There was too much "take-that" in this game, to the point where it seemed it was the only thing to do on some turns.

Also, the number of action cards in hand seemed way off; I think I would have balanced the card drawing differently.  All of this after only one playing, so [i]caveat lector[/i], as they say.  Sadly, I doubt I'll play this one a second time to find out if I was accurate in my assessment.

This game is MEAN with just two and I can't imagine it being much nicer with more.  I do want to try this again with at least a third player but, I figure the sweet spot would be with four.  As a two player game, it's a 6.  We'll see where it goes once I try this one out again with more.

Game play is quick - lots of options, but some clear strategy goals each turn available.  Art is adorable, should make stuffed animals... seriously.  I did not back, wish I had.  I am excited for the success for this game - is seems very deserving of being on the local store's shelf.

[b]Cute, light card game utilizing "take that" elements to create agricultural mayhem.[/b]
r{[i]A fun farming game that keeps you on your toes.[/i]}r

SYNOPSIS
Up to four farmers compete to quickly plant, fertilize and harvest crops among community fields. Play dual purpose crop cards to either plant or fertilize crops, and play action cards for variety of effects on self or others. Goal is to amass most wealth by game end from harvested crops.

COMMENTS
Cute art work and "take that" game play elevate this simple farming game to grow the most successful crops. Subtle meta game strategy focuses on control of available planting fields which can hinder options from turn to turn. The theme works well for competitive or casual play.

PROS+, CONS- & NOTES*
+ Easy to learn & simple to play.
+ Card art suits the theme really well.
- The "take that" play style can be brutal for some.
- Occasional frustrating or unproductive turns can occur.
* Some "cards with text" to manage, but easily remembered once familiar.
* FrankenCrops expansions add more wrinkles to game.
* 2nd edition with changes to the game forthcoming.

I mostly played the game 2p, and in this mode where the item cards become especially useful with the lack of pile on the leader multiplayer diplomacy, the way and rate that the cards come out makes players feel very much in a box...  the best balance to lots of chaos is choice and at one card a turn there just isn't much choice for players.

Got a demo from Grant himself at GaymerX. He's an entertaining and competent teacher who did a great job of engaging us (and the whole while made us feel like he wanted to play games with us, not sell us something). I enjoyed the play but didn't find it compelling enough to pick up. Too much "take that" to make meaningful plans and win strategically.

The game creates a cardinal sin in my book. It gives players cards that let's them protect their cards from any other card effects. And then gives players a different card that ignores that text and lets them destroy someone's progress. Maybe for a light take that game this is okay. 

Strategically my best move was to remove my opponents protection and destroy all his crops and it made me feel bad attacking the other player's work. Would not recommend.

Lots of take that elements. There's a moderate amount of tactical play and hand management, and luck of the card draw is not as prominent than it appears. However for a light card game (that's a bit chaotic and fiddly), it takes too long. There's a lack of sense of progress as a lot of the cards destroy stuff, rather than build it.

RATING: 7.5
Farmageddon does all that Munchkin strives to do -- cute theme with some clever puns and a firm foundation in take-that play -- and ensures that it doesn't outlast its own welcome.  Simple enough to play with young'uns, back-stabby enough to play with growed-ups, and the end-game is absolutely bizarre and wonderful... I'll be unpacking end-game strategies for quite a while.

All of this for $15 American?  Sold.

2017 UPDATE: Still a preferred take-that game, like a mean Bohnanza. I like Rodiek's designs a lot.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.25
Thanks Grant!

There's more here to the game than at first glance.  This is a fun, social game of backstabbery.

We tried this game with 5p (we grabbed a random card to use as a fourth field) and it seemed to either slightly overwhelm the balance of the game (I was the fifth player, and it was rough to even get a field, to say nothing of harvesting) or make it into a chaotic slugfest, depending on your perspective.

I'm not exactly sure where the strategy part got to, but there's plenty of the luck part to go around. A cookie cutter take-that game. Draw cards that will score points, draw cards with actions that allow you to screw up people who are scoring lots of points, play said action cards each turn. Try to look disingenuous in your own turn and do lots of distraction effects, like having scantily clad models walk behind you, so no one will notice your own scoring efforts, leading to them playing their action cards on other players instead. (Note, game does not come with scantily clad models. It would rate higher if it did.) It runs a little long for what it offers, and there's not a lot of pace or fun in the effects, which games in this genre usually need to get more than a play or two. There's little novel here to tempt me back.

I'm not much of a card game fan, but this was okay. I can see it being better with more players. The artwork is fabulous and we laughed at some of the cards. Very light with a "take that" element. I'm keeping it for the artwork and theme alone. Rating based on a 2 player game.

Bought from BGG auction. Cool little game that may be a little too long to qualify as a filler.  Played with the kids so game took longer while they read cards and figured out what to play.  I like the artwork and the gameplay is simple enough.  Not the friendliest game as you are trying to destroy your opponents crops while harvesting yours before they get destroyed.  Decent game.

[5th Street kickstarter 12 edition] {Farm; take-that; optimal 4p} Farmageddon is a cute filler.  The card illustration is quite funny and colorful.

The game may be too long for what it is.... It'd be a great game for around 15-20 minutes.

It is easy to teach the rules, but players need some time to understand the cards.

After an initial play I was pleasantly surprised by what this very simple game has to offer. There is a lot more tension than you see in a typical light card game. This is like Bohnanza with serious aggression. I like it!

RATING: 6
A game of planting crops, fertilising, and ultimately harveting them, heavily seasoned with all sorts of crazy action cards.

I need some more plays to be certain about it, but the game can have unstoppable runaway leaders if the wrong cards get dealt out. If someone gets a bunch of high-valued fields and their opponents don't manage to draw the right cards to destroy or steal them, then they're going to end up a bunch of points ahead. 

The game is fairly quick though, so perhaps a second round hoping that it either doesn't happen again, or hits some other player.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

It's probably not good when the best thing you can think of to say about a game is it's short right? Well that's this game's best feature. There's other short games that fare better than this one though.

RATING: 6
A game with great art and very nice cardstock - you can see and feel that this game will resist many plays.

Tha gameplay is chaotic, with attacks comming all the time and being able to mantain a crop isn't really up to you: is more of others don't have the right cards to screw you. The Foul Manure can help sustain a crop, but by no means is a sure thing.

Im my two games happened that one player couldn't manage to do almost nothing to gain points. Yes, he still was able to bring mayhem to the crop of others, but this don't victory points - only the "evil" enjoyment that appears in the "take that" sort of game. The game is short enough so that the bad luck in the draw doesn't hurt much, but I believe the gameplay for [b]Farmageddon[/b] is lacking somewhat. For a filler this isn't a death sentence. More plays will show if this game have staying power.

I'm not a big fan of games with take-that elements, so it's hard to be a big fan of Farmageddon, since it's really one big game of take-that.  Mechanically, it's a game of hand management (play cards either to plant a crop or fertilize one, and then use action cards to further manipulate the state of the game to your best benefit), but in order to benefit yourself, you're going to have to hurt your opponents at the same time.  It's a little too mean for my tastes, but it's still not a bad game.  Adding the FrankenCorps cards adds a little more of a challenge to the game, but at the cost of more chaos.  Depending on what you like in your games, this can be good or bad.

A fun, "take-that" style card game that has some interesting strategies that aren't immediately apparent.

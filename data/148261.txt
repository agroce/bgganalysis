RATING: 6
The foundation of the game is not very good. The actions are imbalanced, often somewhat boring, the game is designed around a refresh/update phase that only occurs once per game, and it is very easy to build a broken faction - one that simply cannot compete to win games.

That said - the Legacy aspect is fantastic. We have a group of five, and we all agree that without Legacy this game would be BAD. With Legacy, we love putting it on the table for the boxes to open and the new rules and situations to come out.

After loving Pandemic Legacy, this was an awful letdown. Boring, with a runaway leader and an inadequate catch-up mechanism. At this point, I just can't wait till it's over. I cannot recommend this game to anyone as you'll be playing a poor game for entirely too long. I'd give it zero stars if I could.

Initial thoughts after the first session (prologue + 2 games): 
SeaFall certainly looks nice and tickles your imagination. You really do want to sail out to the seas and start exploring. However, at this point I am still unsure what the story is about. So much for the dramatic arc of the campaign. We just sailed around the islands trying to get some cubes and an odd victory point here and there. And it really did not seem to matter too much of what colour the cubes were. The only moments that appeared as game defining decisions were the ones when you had to choose which entry to read from the Captain's Booke. You can only guess the consequences of your decision, and thus these choices are not really decisions in the conventional sense. Even if you knew what you will get, it is too early to say what it is you want in the long run. Although there were very few meaningful decisions in the game, it was fun to sail from an island to another. At least you get to do stuff even if you do not win. 

I am a bit concerned that the playing order is going to affect the game a lot. At least in the beginning of the campaign the last player is left a turn behind as the players getting a head start wipe the nearest islands clean seizing all the cheap victory points in the process. After that it is a race of small margins for the more expensive victory points. Of course, player order is determined by your success in the previous game. So, in principle you should alternate losing and winning every other game. But on the other hand, the player winning a game gets a permanent bonus giving him a semi-permanent victory points or more money, for example. Since money is used for buying VPs, both aforementioned benefits mean that you save a step or two in the VP race during the next game thus getting a compensation for the bad position in the player order. We shall see whether this is a rich get richer and poor stay poor game, or is it at the responsibility of the players to start balancing things out by constantly raiding the player in the lead.

The game endings can be quite sudden. You spend the early game accumulating VPs quite slowly, but then on one turn somebody takes a giant leap forward scoring 5-6 VPs in a single round ending the game. You could see that coming but at least in the first few games you concentrate more on managing your own stuff than paying attention to your opponents.

RATING: 2
Honestly, I really wanted to like this game but there is so much wrong with it. First, if like to say that my group of 4 finished the campaign in 15 games. We finished it just to say we could, most of us were not enjoying the actual game by about game 5. On the my biggest issues:

The rules in this game are possibly the worst I have ever seen. There is way too much ambiguity in them. We found ourselves spending entire sessions looking online for rule clarifications. For the most part all we found was “I think he meant this” if we found anything at all. There are blatant contradictions in the rules that anyone who play tested should have been able to find. 

The “story” was somewhere between awful and incoherent. You read entries from the captain’s log but they are all the same. There is some overlying story about the ancients that was basically rubbish.

The mechanics were all the same regardless of which action you are using.  

Luck. Nothing is more frustrating than playing a good game only to have someone get lucky when doing an explore and getting a grip of glory points to win the game. Luck is in any board game but I don’t believe I have ever been so frustrated with its ability to completely turn this game around.

At the end of the game my entire group was ready to never play it again and all rated the game somewhere between 2 and 3.  This was a group that rated Pandemic: Legacy 10/10 easily.  Don’t bother with this game.

(No spoilers)

We have completed our campaign!  I was super excited to play SeaFall, but I now have mixed opinions on it now.  The Legacy aspects were cool as hell, and there were some very exciting reveal moments.  I think, though, that the game has a few moderate to severe flaws that keep it from being truly great.

Firstly, the manual lightly glosses over some details that are extremely important to proper play, which makes it very easy to play incorrectly.  Since this is a campaign game, such mistakes can be almost impossible to correct later.

Secondly, I think that the game isn't clear enough about how vital it is to explore.  If you mistakenly come to believe that you can focus on military conquest or trading, you're going to have a very poor score, since the vast majority of glory comes from exploration.  If each player specializes in a different area, the player that specialized in exploration will have a huge lead by the time everyone figures this out.

Lastly, the final mystery is rather obtuse, and what you're supposed to do to proceed is pretty unclear.  After several games of seemingly no progress, we had to look up the solution.  It turned out that several of us had the necessary information/resources to proceed, but none of us knew that we were allowed to do what we were supposed to do, and were searching for the final permission to proceed.  I wish that the components in question had been more explicit about giving you this ability.

Ultimately, I'm glad we played SeaFall to its conclusion.  The idea was really awesome, but the execution could have been a lot better than it ended up being with some tweaks.

Would have rated it a 9, but came in a little lower because of the lack of clarity in the rules (and absence of any official FAQ), and the unnecessarily abrupt ending. Still was a great experience going through the campaign.

This game has gotten some negative press ... and in my opinion, undeservedly so.  The game was extraordinarily ambitious in its design and, as a result, has hit snags with rules ambiguities.  In order to get the most enjoyment out of this game, you must be willing to pour over the rules multiple times, ask questions on the forums, closely examine the FAQs, and be willing to accept that you will make rules mistakes.  When you do, hopefully you will catch them and be able to fix them without too much trouble.  I have made lots of mistakes but we have managed to correct them without too much collateral damage.  

Another issue is the runaway leader situation.  In our game there was a runaway leader.  If you will be disappointed if the game is not "nip and tuck" the entire way, then you probably should pass here.  If you are playing merely for the experience, win or lose, it is an excellent experience.  

Finally, this is a heavy and long game.  We played with 4 players, played fairly efficiently, and it took 2 to 3 hours per game.  There are also periods of down time between turns because the game is not interactive with respect to game mechanics.  However, there is enough to occupy you between your turns if you pay attention to what your opponents are doing.  Learn from their strategies and recognize what they are doing so you can either stop them or do it before they do.  

You can also get this game fairly inexpensively now ... for under $40, so I think it is well worth the experience if you still are interested after the pitfalls I have mentioned.

Started out strong but drug on mightily at the end with no mechanism or incentive for losers to continue to play.  Very swingy and random.  Dominant strategy.  Rules are poorly written causing heavy confusion.  Late game forces players to make assumptions/leaps about what to do following detailed explicit instructions up to that point.  Overall: great concept, short on execution.  Regret my 15 session campaign which our group finally pulled the rip cord on because it hadn't been fun since about game 6.

2 plays in: Loving it.  It's a legacy format Euro game, based on pick up and deliver, but with a nice PvP mechanic.  I haven't played enough to fully grasp the enmity system, but I appreciate what it has already done to our play strategy.  There's not much of a narrative so far, but you build your own story by naming everything in the game.  We play about once every week or two, for one game per session.  A five player game took 2.5 hours, but I expect this to speed up.  We had some slow rounds where people had to go over rules a few times.  So far, it's an 8.

5 games in: Great game, getting even better.  I find it to be extremely balanced and interesting.  The decisions you make, often without perfect knowledge, have lasting impact.  There's a real sense of adventure, as we don't know what the best strategies might turn out to be, but we have some clues about what might be coming.  So far, there's a nice balance between approaches: players favoring exploration jumped out in front but are now running out of easy paths to victory, while the slower trading players are starting to build up their engines.

6 games: unlocked something really awesome. You need this game in your life.  

8 games in: I'm starting to sour on this a little bit.  We know what to do and have unlocked how to end the game, but achieving the necessary conditions is going to be a slog.  We play two times a month, and enthusiasm is waning a bit, as this is starting to feel more like a chore.  We have had some changes in the leaderboard, but for the most part two players (myself and another) have been in the lead.

11 games: I suffered a very nasty dice result to drop me pack to the pack, but every dice game involves swings. Anyone can win at this point.  I do think it peaked too soon, and I'm hoping we end it quickly. Having said that, it's still a great game, and I had a blast playing it. I'd like to finish next session and retire this with an 8.  There were some great moments, and I got a lot of value out of this. I recommend it to anyone. 

12 games: Opened the final box and crowned an emperor.  The guy in third place snuck in to find the final island, but he didn't win the title of Emperor.  

Final thoughts: the game provided a mix of highs and lows. It suffers from ridiculous expectations, and it's a bit too long. But it's still got some truly great moments and is worth playing, especially if you like both board games and RPGs.

RATING: 7
I like the theme, I like the idea and 5 of 7 games were really fun to play.

However, the other 2 games were extremely frustrating. One being number one of my most frustrating gaming experiences ever. The reason for this is the extremely huge, swingy and sometimes unpredictable amount of glory that can be gained in a single turn. The very frustrating game was ended by a 13(!) glory swing on turn 3(!) that nobody saw coming.

Also, there is no game night without a rules discussion. The rule book is just not clear on a lot of things. Particularly confusing are the rules for enmity and creation of the dice pool depending on what you want to raid. The responses of the authors in the forums are not very helpful either, since they are often handwavy, still unclear or contradictory.

I still like to play it, but this two points really drag the rating down.

RATING: 10
Greetings, let me begin by saying that I never rate games a 10, but this one deserves it despite all the bad press it has recieved.
Before buying the game I read an awful lot of negative reviews and watched a lot of review videos. Given all the negative feedback it was recieving, I bought it with my guard up, ready to stop playing after the first couple of games.

That didn't happen.

We are 2 or 3 games from the end of the legacy, so my opinion may change, if it does, I shall review my rating, until then, it stands.

So, let us look at some of the common complaints about the game and tackle them one by one:

1) It's not Pandemic: Legacy... No shit. Really? I am currently half way through a Pandemic legacy and to compare these games to one another is an intellectual fail on every level, they are different games. The only common trait they have is that you make permanent changes. But if forced to compare the two I would say this; The cooperative nature of Pandemic means that there's no way to strategise, or plan your next game until it's set up with the initial infections placed. Whereas between bouts of Seafall I'm constatntly thinking about what strategy I'll employ next time, what would be my most efficient opening? What upgrades should I gun for? Also the story feels more personal, the story in Pandemic happens at you, whereas I feel like I'm creating the story of Seafall.

2) It's boring... No it isn't, you are and you have no imagination or attention span. There can be a lot of downtime, but not if you actually pay attention to other peoples moves, which is very important to do if you actually want to stay in the race. The game has story, adventure, exploration and sea battles. I can't see what's boring here.

3) The rulebook is awful... Yes, yes it is. I can't defend that.

4) It's swingy and unpredictable and just when I get somewhere, someone wins... That's true too, but tuck in your bottom lip and suck at the game less. You can get a glory point or two each turn and make your way up the track that way... or you can play clever, be behind in points for most of the game while farming to smash those milestones, and then be up there with those that have been steadily gaining points each turn. Different ways of playing in a PvP game. Most of the people that make this complaint seem to be sore at losing. I'm going to hazard a guess that a good proportion of the people that dislike this game do so because they keep losing.

5) It's muddled and unpredictable; new unforseen events make my strategy pointless... Don't like surprises, huh? What fun is being able to predict everything?

6) Too random; games can be won or lost on the roll of a dice... Yep, I had super bad luck in my last game, could have won if my raid was successfull, but came in last due to a really unlucky roll, woe is me. Welcome to real life, you can stack the odds in your favour as much as you want, but ever had days where things just keep going wrong when they shouldn't? Why should this game be any different? Play the odds, tip them in your favour and hope for the best, nothing is ever guaranteed, in life or this game. The sooner you realise this, the sooner you'll start having fun and not being too bitter about bad luck.

All in all I would say that this is a great game, it is dripping with atmosphere, tells a great story and has all the huge ups and downs that make something truly exciting. I would call it the ulimate rollercoaster of a board game and I continually looking forward to the next game.

Played eight sessions of two games each, opened all but the final box. Eventually becomes nested prayers to the RNGods to hope you'll get access to something that will let you advance. Many ambiguous/unclear rules, the resolution of which brings a session to a grinding halt.
We tried. We really did. But there's no way I can recommend this game, because once you open box 5 it becomes an endless slog that becomes slower and less fun each time, as you have fewer and fewer sources of points.
This would have been a 7 or 8 star rating three sessions ago.

This game is incredible if you are into Legacy games.  The emergent story is engaging and there are loads of surprises.  However, the rules leave out a lot of details and the FAQ is a must.  It is extremely EASY to forget or miss something, forget to get points that are due you, or understand certain strategies, so you need to be very careful.  That makes it hard to recommend, but my family is having a blast with it. 

If the rules were comprehensive and well-written, this would be my favorite boardgame of all time, hands down.  Play this game, but keep the BGG FAQ handy because you will need it to play properly.

Very dull and frustrating base mechanics ( buy/deliver/upgrade ) plus luck based exploration which yield little story ( boring and repetitive stories in the book ) does not encourage to play the game at all.

2/21/17: Review is based on one play of the game, the third game in the series for this copy.  Excessively tactical, and not my sort of game, even though I won that night's game.  I had been trying to avoid playing and only played because I wasn't given an alternative.  I'll continue to try to avoid playing this.  Hence my rating.  

To me the closest equivalent is Tales of Arabian Nights, which is a game that you play for the experience, with little thought to whether you actually win.  It's a tactical story telling game where events will overshadow your ability to control destiny.  Seafall felt very similar to me.

Things I like about it:
:star: I do like the concept of a legacy system.
:star: Allows some economic development/advancement
:star: I do like the building of emnity over time.
:star: There is some minor advancement
:star: Well done pieces and art.

Things I didn't care for.
:nostar: For the amount of time to play this to the end, I'd rather invest it in something else. It's going to be a dozen or so nights.
:nostar: requires you get the same people night after night.  I wasn't initially in the select group and was happy about it.  Came to another gamenight where they were missing one of the players and was dragooned into playing.
:nostar: the amount of long term development that you can do is very negligible.  Almost all the work you do to develop your player position is thrown away at the end of the evening of gaming.
:nostar: Not my style of gaming.  I won by putting more emphasis on direct conflict, and less on economic development.
:nostar: Other than the points that you carry over from game to game, and research, there is next to no long term development.  Since I had won, I didn't even get to keep a character card.
:nostar: I think that with repeated play this would really start dragging for me.
:nostar: Hard to figure out what you should be focusing on.  That feeling didn't change as I played the game.
:nostar: Exploration is inherently very random.  This doesn't necessarily make a good game mechanic.  I think that the frustration with this would build after several games.

RATING: 6
Amazing start, the first few games are really exciting. Then it slows down, which is acceptable, but made me rush a few rounds just to finish a game in a reasonable amount of time.

The legacy aspects seem to be nice, though I feel some could have a bigger impact. 

I cannot rate this really high because of several severe problems with the rules and materials. Many rules are poorly explained, in addition there are multiple mistakes on the cards, which can lead to problems which drag on into the next game. Also, putting stickers on spaces on the board where it folds? I had to cut through a few islands to be able to put the game back into the box... really, for a game with this budget, one can expect a little more.

I don't understand why anyone finds this game entertaining.  The game is a complete and total drag and, while they try to prevent the run away affect, it doesn't work.  My group TRIED and TRIED to like this game but the continuous addition of new rules constantly had us looking through the book trying to remember every little detail.  This coming from a group that went through Imperial Assault.  The rules were just so insanely ridiculous it made Fantasy Flight rulebooks look amazing.  I can't imagine anyone ever exploring the western most board.  Due to the various event cards that come out, your ships limited ability to take damage, the limited locations to repair, the limited locations to sell goods, it just made the game unbearable after the 3rd "game".  In addition, this game prevents you from really exploring.  As you start adding structures and ship upgrades, someone has already amassed the points required to end the game and all of those temporary upgrades were for nothing.  I enjoyed the exploration and raiding part of the game but when you put all of it together, it's just one big mess.   As a group, we decided to stop playing and trash this thing.  If I had an option to play this game or repeatedly get kicked in the nuts, I'll opt for the later.

Don't play this as a Euro. Treat it as an exciting, unfolding story. Name your islands, create elaborate backgrounds for your characters. Have friends over for dinner, drinks, dessert, and Seafall. It's at its best as an experience and its worst as a trading simulation. Pursue risks and adventure.

I really enjoyed this game.  I admit, however, that it's not for everyone.  By the standards of your typical Euro-game fan, this game:
* is fairly long -- a typical game might easily last 2-3 hours, and the campaign will take about 15 of those games to finish.
* is fairly complex -- and the rules get more complex over the course of the campaign
* has direct player-v-player conflict -- played as intended, players will be attacking each other to take their stuff
* has a heavy luck factor -- when you take an action, you might get a prize ... or you might sink, gain nothing, and get sent back home to rebuild
* is not remotely like Pandemic Legacy, even though it's by Rob Daviau and is a Legacy game

The single biggest criticism I (and many others) have of the game is that the rules leave a lot to be desired, due to ambiguity or even outright contradiction, especially as rules get added to the book.  But this is generally fixable, just look for the answer to your question in the FAQ (https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1606358/captains-log-unofficial-seafall-faq-and-compilatio).

So if you prefer light to mid-weight Euro games and hate games with luck, or are hoping that SeaFall is Pandemic Legacy II, then this might not be your game.

But if the theme appeals to you, and you don't mind more meaty, confrontational games, don't mind luck, and are willing to tolerate a few warts, then this game can be an amazing experience!

Glad I own it, glad to have purchased the pre-order one for the metal coins, they ROCK! The game unfolds nicely before you and looks fantastic on the table. Yes the color palette is muted, but it honestly does not detract from MY experience, I can see where some may have an issue with seeing things based on color vision,but this is a hurdle shared by all games. The scheme is thematic and fits, so I like it. Component wise its above average which is a good thing and presents a fair value to what I know about it now, coins not withstanding. 

Part of my draw here is the designer himself, and also that this is the true "originator of the species" though not first to market. I liked the idea of his original thought in its original form over that of Pandemic. A game whose original version is a very enjoyable game for me as well. I admittedly have avoided that one, but plan to get to it sometime, but not before the original!

are you tired of your monotonous shitty boring life? do you wish you could go on swashbuckling adventures with captain jack sparrow (TM), orlando bloom and keira portman while a hans zimmer score blares in the background? well seafall is here to whisk you away!
whats that you say? seafall isn't anything like pirates of the Caribbean? well i guess you must have missed the part where the black pearl had to haul a buttload of linen. it was in the second movie i swear.
seafall is the spiritual successor to skyfall but without a bitchin theme song. its a legacy game so you'll need some friends who want to regularly spend time with you...lol. and also devote a large chunk of their time playing a board game (hint: losers). in it you explore the high seas and find great treasure and unravel an ancient mystery while controlling the winds with a magical baton and a talking boat. oh wait wrong game.

RATING: 5
This is my first foray into a legacy game and I only played the prologue and the first game. My thoughts are that there are too many rules hurdles/fiddliness for such a simple game and payoff. Maybe after a few more games there is an enlightenment or some new mechanic/gameplay that I find engaging, but for now it's just a middle of the road game that could be fun with the right group.

Update after 11 sessions: The randomness and repetitiveness is just too much for my Euro blood. Lather, rinse, repeat. If you're into storytelling games, this may hold your interest. If not, stay away.

RATING: 2
finished the 9th game and everything other than the 6th box has been opened, it no longer seems like anyone is having fun, every game feels like it is dragging and the past 2 games have lasted 3 hours each because of new additions from a box that was opened. The end of the game seemed promising and I get where the enjoyment of this ending is but I don't understand the design, It is far to random with no direction, all everyone sees is this huge gap between us and 30 exploration to reveal the final island (which can be seen on the board from game one). There no longer seems to be progression to reach that 30, only random chance with the new content given to us from the new boxes unlocked. In game 9 my unlucky roll was the nail in the coffin for me as I had built up a pool of 17 dice to roll against a certain endeavor requiring 10 successes I failed by exactly 1 success, Almost everything I had done the entire game had come to that one roll and failed due to pure luck. This game for me is done.

Trudging through six games to the seventh game still with 2 more boxes to open.
Story Elements? and narrative
The game's narrative at the prologue  made it seem like the game would have a interesting plot following the completion of all major milestones and games, I was sadly mistaken as the small exploration narratives are all individual occurrences and quickly lose any sense of immersion as they start to all seem similar in tone and writing of meeting natives or resources or letting people on board your ship and placing a sticker on the board, now I tune out whatever is being said during someone else's successful exploration event. Inspired by the "4X" genre seems completely odd, I do not in anyway feel like an empire of people, I feel like one person and two ships this game and do not in any way feel like I'm building anything game from game other than the board itself,
Game play and Legacy
Unlike the Narrative at the beginning of the prologue the simplified pick up and deliver aspect to the game was boring and in any other game would have been abandoned almost immediately, but this is a legacy game that almost feeds off your hopes to open fun and interesting new additions to the rules and the board so that you delve into the next game with excitement despite the horrible game you just played. The first few boxes opened feel like they just extended the plank to keep us able to continue to play the game and adding more of the same to the game, which was extremely disappointing especially since each game takes 1.5 - 2 hours with five players.
 Milestones seem to be diverse for the first few games until the third or fourth game, which is when exploring becomes required if you care about winning, almost all other avenues of gaining VP become overshadowed by the rewards of exploring, usually 4 - 5 VP for certain explorations plus a bonus of some kind in games  with milestones for exploration adding even more to the 4 initial 4 - 5 VP .The VP goal of games in that range are 13 - 14 VP.. One player in our group found this out early and has won the past 3 games now being ahead of everyone by almost 20 points overall. Exploration makes the game extremely swingy with the consequences of bad luck and failing the roll required to explore can result in completely being reset back to the start for a player investing their time into exploration.
Overall I think this game is not worth playing for 12 + hours and makes me never want to buy a legacy game.

The game is just too slow, but not in an entertaining way. Everything is like trudging through mud, and I felt it suffers from a runaway leader problem as well.

It's a game that plays itself! Unfortunately it still needs asses in seats to power it; but perhaps the next legacy game will change the need for players who have to suffer through the mind numbing boredom and soul-crushing illusury decisions this "game" forces upon you.

Adding some variants to improve the experience and delving in again has increased my fondness for the game.  Hopefully it will fix our issues and I'll upvote it even more.
Playing some games since our 2 Seafall campaigns have ended has made me rethink the score down another 2 points.
Up until game 9 or 10 and box 4 I would've given a 9 or 10.  Right around box 5 there was a growing dislike and now, with 1 final game ahead, we all pretty much hate it and most likely won't spend any more time to complete it.  Too many rule checks, forum searches, wild swings in points, heavy emphasis on exploring, balancing issues, games ending way too quickly.  There is a lot here and if a 2.0 came out to address, we might change.  I actually had 2 copies and ran a second campaign that we ran because we loved the first 8 games so much.  Wish we would've waited.

So far we're 3 games into the official campaign plus the prologue.  Seafall thus far is interesting but it hasn't been a lot of fun, yet.  My rating will change as more of the campaign plays out.  Then again how bad can a game be that I get 16 plays out of?

We're 6 games in.  It's not getting better.  I doubt we get past 9.

It didn't get better.  This was an interesting idea that just didn't come together as a good game.  We scrapped the game for parts.

RATING: 5
For me there just wasn't anything there for me to grab on to as the opening games are just a repetition of going out and exploring, coming back to base, going out and exploring, going back to base and so on.  Then there is the fact the goal goes higher and higher each game but the opportunity for points don't increase at the same rate.  After our first couple games my group stopped because the game was just boring and long.

It's hard to score this DURING one's first campaign, but once it's over, I think the metric of how often you'd play it if it was available starts to lose meaning.

After the prologue and two games I'm really looking forward to game three. I played Risk Legacy but not Pandemic Legacy. It's important to take risks in this game because the rewards for doing so are quite significant. And if your ship sinks you get a new one so the real cost is just the turn lost. Time is the most important asset because the early games are won by the players pursuing points. The losers of the previous game gets the starting positions in the next along with some other goodies so there's some really nice balancing mechanisms in place. So get out there and raid and explore!

RATING: 2
Hands down the most disappointing gaming experience I have ever had. No other game plummeted so quickly in my mind from "OMG I can't wait!" to "Wow, this sucks." Incredibly slow game play, uninteresting decisions, repetitive and tedious actions, high elements of luck rewarding some players arbitrarily over others, rich-get-richer power-up mechanics. And it's SOOO LOOOOOONG. The enmity tokens mechanic is good, and I like how the Legacy elements get added continuously throughout each game. But these decent game ideas, not to mention the cheesy, poorly-written storybook, do nothing to elevate what is simply, at its heart, a bad game. I would much rather play three mediocre games in the three hours it would take to play one single game of SeaFall again. 

Oh, and the best part is that I now have a crappy game I've barely played that is completely worthless and unsellable to someone who might like it. Into the trash where it belongs.

UPDATE: Happily auctioned off for $15, after I carefully placed the stickers back on the sticker sheet and erased the small amount of writing we had done.

A tough game to rate. It is obvious how much work went into the design and creation of this game. It really is an achievement. The captain's book itself, the introduction of many new rules that themselves have to be playable and somewhat balanced etc. I can't imagine the amount of playtesting this required. 

The basic mechanisms of the game do keep you coming back for more. Just like most IOS games, the fulfilling of achievements and leveling up to get better stuff are somewhat addicting. To me, just enough stuff carries over and the story progresses enough to make me curious about continuing. 

The basic game picks up on the choose your own adventure like encounter scenario mechanism I have seen recently in games like Above and Below or Scythe. The success or failure of these encounters is by (sometimes modified) die roll. The combination of the randomness of these outcomes (die-roll and encounter result)can be mind-bogglingly frustrating. Having your ships sink is a disaster and ruins the entire session for you. Obviously, since the game takes 14-15 individual sessions, you can come back from a couple of these, but not fun when it happens. But it can be equally frustrating to see someone explore something easy and get sweet rewards, and then you work hard over many turns to explore a skull spot and get dick. It is thematic, but still frustrating. 

But those are the kind of things that create narrative in the game, 'remember when' moments. So I can forgive that. To build a game about a struggling civilization and not have some mishaps and tragedy along the way would be pretty boring. 

For the gameplay itself, yeah, every game, you will sail, explore, pick up and deliver goods etc. But there are a variety of things you can do, lots of buildings and ship upgrades, so different paths you can pursue game to game. More than most games, I feel like I have been willing to explore those different avenues, trying different things just for the sake of it, without exactly giving up on the goal of winning the game. The randomness in outcomes also forces the player to be adaptable and potentially shift strategy.

I very much enjoyed the legacy experience itself. But for someone like me, where a 15 game 35-hour journey with the same players is something that will be rare in my life, I think waiting for the inevitably better legacy games is probably worth it. There are a few reasons I might not ultimately recommend this experience.

First, from a pure gameplay perspective, there are things that happen in the game that you have no way of predicting that validate past strategic actions. Oops, should have been doing that all game instead! And there are certain milestones, particularly towards the end that require A LOT of work for little payoff. Again, without knowing that in advance. 

Also, there are many rules ambiguities throughout the game. Towards the end, there were some that required looking up that divulged some game secrets. These should have been much clearer. There was an unclear milestone that had been completed for games and may have moved things along. There were a lot of edge 
cases that required table interpretation. The L.o.T. was a fun mechanism but caused a major bogdown in the game. How to handle sharing of information there was very unclear. Getting the relevant information took a long time. 

After about 10 games, I felt I had seen everything the game had to offer, but the game continued on. The last third is a slog. While clever, it is a little bit of an annoying puzzle. 

By far the longest comment I have ever written but also by far the longest game I have ever played! I would absolutely be lying if I said I didn't have fun with it. But everyone in my group was ready for it to be done games before it actually was. This experience was so far different than a typical game that rating it on the same scale probably is unfair. I think someday I could see myself saying that my favorite overall gaming experience ever was a legacy game. I think that potential is there. Just not this one.

Oh, how I was looking forward to this.  I loved Pandemic and Risk Legacies.  I love the age of sail. I love exploration... I REALLY didn't like this game.  My friends were great gaming partners, but the game had so many wildly random aspects that I could not fully enjoy it.  After about 1/3 of the games I just viewed it as a weekly adventure that I would go on, not caring about points but hoping to get more than some token reward or sunken ship out of an endeavor.  This is my first rating ever with a decimal point.

Imagine playing MegaCIV and three hours into the game you realize you have no chance of winning.  Now, imagine that instead of nine more hours of game to endure... you have about THIRTY more hours of game to endure.  Yes, you can have some games that you accomplish something or have some other fun thing happen... but overall, I'm happy to be finished with it.

1 Started out good, even shot up to a 9 in my estimation, but the end of the game just dragged on and on and once the initially exciting legacy aspects wear off and you are just trying to finish the game... the actual gameplay just isn't that fun. The story is interesting and the legacy part is great but the foundation is just not a great game. Seafall the non-legacy game wouldn't stand on it's own, and in the end that is what you end up playing just trying to slug it through to the end.

I genuinely enjoyed my group's campaign. The way that the group shapes the game through naming characters and landmarks, the satisfaction of tearing things to shreds, and the excitement of new unveiling new plot/mechanics throughout gameplay all made it a thoroughly fun experience. It helped that the group was very willing to weave our own story and character arcs into the tidbits of lore in the Captain's Booke.

As a game, though, it falls short in a few key ways.
1) Rules are not always clear. This is partially due to the fact that half of the rulebook is unveiled over the course of the campaign and the developers were doing their best not to spoil things.

2) The choose-your-own-adventure style of the Captain's Booke makes for some very unpredictable swings in point scoring. It would be one thing if every scenario had a hint or good/bad decision, but there were many times when we were surprised by which choice led to the good/bad outcome. If you're trying to play optimally, this is frustrating. On the other hand, it's immensely fun if you treat it as more of an RPG where you act in the spirit of your character.

3) There are some balance issues. Certain strategies are significantly more viable than others because the game rarely exceeds 7 turns (barely one winter), much less reaching a second winter. The problem here is that the game was clearly designed to take 50%-100% longer than it typically does and hence there are a few features that fall by the wayside.

You really have to be in the mood for this one. The exploration part is nice although could be done better. The economics/colony part is boring the combination of the two makes for a mediocre game. We stopped after 5 turns. Two of us were having fun exploring, while the other player were just moving resources around and getting bored. There is also a lot of down time. Could design a better game.

Finished it! And...the last game seemed interesting but was 100% way too easy, even with the additional event deck variant stuff. 

Seafall is a 7. It's ambitious but too long, I love luck but said luck can render your entire game's work nil due to an unlucky card draw, and frankly some of the *secret* stuff was not intertwined in with the story or game contents well enough which led to filler games. Plus the lack of any real comment on colonialism or your player role in it was an easy missed opportunity that could have added value to the game. Plus the final games were truly disappointing ways to end the pulpy and very incomplete story.

But bar those complaints I actually loved the majority of my time with it? Of the 15 (16 including prologue) games only 4 of them dragged or had a major luck-alone-destroys-everything moment. And sure, playing it with 2 players & 2 automas means the rounds fly by, but I'd recommend this to someone who find a copy and wants to stick in 30 hours to a single, somewhat innovative & interesting game.

-----

After 4 proper games & the prologue I am having a blast with 2 players & 2 automas. 2 major boxes have been unlocked so the rules are a little fuzzier, and I am losing, but this is really fun.

It's a bit messy and unwieldy and there's a lot more reliance on luck than most people will like (I've even been annoyed once by 1 ultra-unlucky unlikely dice roll) but as long as you have 2 plans in mind -in case plan 1 falls on it's arse due to luck- it's grand and makes me want to play more. You just have to be more flexible in your approach than it first seems.

-----

Played the prologue and a few proper games and so far it seems fairly simple and full of luck & flow. The rules are questionable but the FAQ on BGG helps a ton.

Playing this with 2 players and automas makes it fly by too, so the ludicrously long playing time was...an hour. For the prologue. While learning the game for the two of us! And we made sure we got rules right mid-game.

I'll be willing to houserule things if the game does slow down a lot at any point (eg: keeping one province upgrade/ship upgrade in-between games, allowing you to keep what's in your warehouse/cash pile etc), but as long as it flies by and we can read the awkwardly bad but pulpy fun write-ups? I'll be happy :)

----

Bought new & sealed for $15AUD from a charity store. In Australia with the universally hated board game tax that's pretty incredible! 

Considering I've wanted a copy since the hype died down and people started saying it was fairly average at best, that's pretty cool!

As a lover of Sunless Sea, strange forebodings, bad pulp writing, alongside being a fond creator of personalities assigned to names I give created characters and crew, I know this will be a fun ride.

My rating/review is based on a full campaign playthrough. Summary: unique game with interesting legacy elements, marred by incomplete rules, poor storytelling and runaway leader.

Legacy (+3). Unique game. The contents of the boxes are generally very good. 

Campaign (+2). (This is not the same as Legacy, e.g. Descent 2 is a campaign game) It makes the individual games more engaging. 

Theme (+1). I happen to like age of sails and adventure. 

Components (+1). The game looks good and the components are durable.

Rules (-4). The rulebook does not set out all the rules that you absolutely need to play the game. (Not at the start of the campaign but later when introducing certain new elements of the game) There are also many ambiguities, bad structure etc. It is easy to make a mistake that has a very significant effect on the game. Looking for answers wastes game time and there is high chance to find spoilers instead of answers. 

Talentless story telling (-3). The Captain Booke is bad. Most of the adventures are boring repetitions. More importantly, the story is full of clichés written in a language which attempts to be eloquent and “old” but fails miserably. It is pain to read most of the adventures, not least because of the terrible font of the book.

The length of an individual game and chance (-2). Many elements (e.g. power of structures) appear to be balanced for  games that last for 12+ turns. In practice the game rarely lasts beyond the eight turn. In order to win you have to optimize heavily but this does not sync with the amount of luck in the game. An example of excessive luck: the exact same action with perfect roll of dice may yield: a) 1 VP and bunch of resources. The value of these resources is very situational, typically you can convert the resources into 0-2 VP; b) 5 VP + a permanent item, which will probably earn you a lot of VPs in the future games.

After delving into a cooperative legacy game, I was curious to try this competitive style. We now have a solid group of 5 players and are aiming to get it played at least once a month if possible. We're two games in at the point of me writing this mini-review.

On the plus side - this has some nice pieces to it, there are a good number of choices involved, and I like the "choose your own adventure" aspect to exploration.

On the negative side - the rules can get pretty confusing, and a handy index for special cases/situations would be helpful. I'm also baffled why there's not a quick player aid for the gold values that get used consistently - it would have been simple to include something that says "3 gold to buy a good, 6 gold from selling a good" etc.

I'm definitely not deterred from continuing to play the game, but the learning curve and the time we've wasted hunting down how to handle special situations is frustrating.

UPDATE: After several plays, I was done with this game, as were my fellow players. We felt like it was just doing the same thing over and over, and if a player managed to get a colony they could just dominate while everyone else watched. The time invested on it was going to be far too much for what we got out of it. Very disappointed, and this publisher is going to have to go a long way to win back my trust.

Ah, SeaFall. There are a *lot* of neat things here, and I loved the first 6-8 games of our campaign with at most minor reservations. (Rating 9.)

Those reservations have multiplied, and there are a few things about the game I find quite frustrating - but despite those frustrations, I admire the scope and ambition of the design, and feel like it fails in places partly because the designer reached so high. 

Which is more fun, a flawless trip you've made many times before, or a flawed journey that goes places you've never seen? I think it depends on what you're looking for... though how discomfiting you find the particular flaws is probably also important.

I really don’t get the criticisms. We’re up to game 9 now and unlocked boxes 1-5 by the end of game 6. I can’t see how the game can drag when we’re going through at such a pace. HOWEVER, I do agree that the quality of the game design (and rules) goes downhill in box 5. I’ve never had to search for so many rules clarifications and for that reason i’ve droped the score from 9 to 8.

4 games into the campaign:
Play sessions are taking ~4 hours with setup, play, opening new stuff, cleanup, and they are getting longer as the glory goal keeps increasing, exploration sites take more turns to reach, etc.
Milestones and wins are the only thing to play for, but glory points (by themselves) are terrible. Coming in 2nd in a game makes every future game objectively harder for you, as turn order is everything. Tanking every other game is probably best, especially early in the campaign.

This game makes me feel gross when I do well, shame when I do poorly, and generally nauseous. Emotionally I'm best off just playing as if I was controlling an NPC for the sake of the other players. 

So, yeah. This is the sort of game that can unravel gaming groups.

RATING: 2
I like exploring mechanics and how the legacy works, but the game is fairly simplistic otherwise.

Downgraded- the story mechanic doesn't yield much sense of wonder. You simply get another resource on the board and we're still selling wood for VP's. 

Downgraded again-- The game's mechanics have been frustrating enough to the game actively anxious or not enjoying the game experience. 

Downgraded-- considering I will never play this again and would be hard pressed to ever even play another legacy game I think this one has earned a 2.

I am enjoying the game and the legacy aspect of it all. If you take your time with the game and spread out your play sessions I think it helps the game a lot. I love legacy games and how they change and grow based on what you do in game. Seafall is also a interesting game on its own with with the different strategies that can be used to get glory (victory points).

Slog of slogs is what this game is. I quit after a few games, opened the rest, and didn't really care much about the boxes I opened. Most were more boring than the last.

The game started out amazing, with a lot of freedom and promise. The games were shorter, with room for apparent growth as victory point conditions grew to higher and higher amounts, and new boxes looming with each subsequent game.

After close to 10 total games now, the excitement level has dropped. Milestones worth an explosion of glory are not being met each game, and the game seems to limp along rather than make us look forward to playing the next time.

Since opening the second to last box, the group, as a collective, has shown lost interest, winning or losing no longer matters and finishing the game for the sake of finishing is taking over. There is a clear runaway leader at this point, and the catch-up mechanic does not scale into late game as it should to try and restore balance.

Overall, the game feels like you need to rush to finish it in 7-8 plays in order to fully enjoy it, and each game that exceeds that playtime diminishes the impression left.

After about 8 games I think I'm qualified to say that this is a pretty darn good Legacy game.

We're playing with 4 players and the story/game has evolved really nicely.

The player who was in last place two games ago is now in first.

The game rewards a variety of strategies and has numerous tactical opportunities each turn.

Recommended.

RATING: 6.5
Bah, this is a really hard game to rate. 

All the negative things in the reviews are 100% true in my opinion. The games end too abruptly, so much of your work is thrown away each game, the story is loosely defined and the exploration stories are the same thing written 50 different ways.  Our group has played just shy of 10 games, opened all but two of the boxes and still didnt seem close to finishing it and now we have left it for Gloomhaven. 

But...

I still want to finish it...I want to open those last boxes, I want to name all the advisors, I want to see all the secrets that it contains. 

Is it a good game?  No, I don’t think it is, but it carries enough intrigue within the box that despite how many flaws it has, and it has many...I still need to find a way to convince the rest of the group to finish it with me.

I don’t know what that says other than maybe it would have been better if we had never started it in the first place.

Lots of promise let down by sub par mechanics and a lot of late game stalling. We gave up after nothing new happened in 5 games (I think we happened to open up some boxes too rapidly for pacing)

I really enjoyed the legacy elements of this though, probably more than any of the other ones I've tried so far. It really felt like you were discovering a world together. 

The biggest problem I had with the game mechanically was that every game simultaneously felt like they went on too long, and ended too quickly. The playtime and pacing was a bit slow, but the points always passed "game over" right as you start getting some sort of engine set up and the interesting parts start.

Many games in and our group is yet to see what the negativity attached to this game is, not saying we wont, but...
None of us are having problems with the rules, it's just like Pandemic Legacy - do what you're told, when you're told to do it, don't do what you're not told to do.
We're all having fun exploring, raiding and expanding our versions world/story - as far as we can tell the negativity seems to come from those who had preconceptions on, or desires for, what the game should be, rather than playing it for what it is.
Maybe we'll change our tune later, but so far so good.

RATING: 2
This game is awful.  We went through 6 of the 15 supposed games and called it done.  I like to think that's giving the game a properly-fair shake.  I can't imagine this game was ever properly tested or played even casually before it was released.  How a team of people could possibly get together, play Seafall and collectively decide that it was good enough to release is beyond me.  There's absolutely nothing redeeming here and if the argument is that I have to make it to game 15 in order to see any redemption, then you ought to really think about your reasoning and whether or not that's something a sane person would say.

Mechanically, Seafall works, but just because you have moving parts that move when needed, it doesn't mean those parts are fun to move.  On your turn, you attempt two actions, then the next person goes and so on until someone eventually gets enough points to end the session.  Points can be won, bought, or simply gained by accomplishing the most basic of tasks, so on the plus side, a session doesn't last too long... but it lasts longer than it ought to.  Part of this is the heavy reliance on the storybook, which would be an interesting idea if most of the entries weren't the same.  In an MMO or RPG, a fetch quest by any other name is still a fetch quest, and in SeaFall, discovering an island space always presents you with a binary choice and usually going with the intuitive choice is going to punish you.  In short, if you don't take the position of "I'm an asshole sea captain", then you will not be rewarded.  For example, let's say you find a scary spooky cave - choice A is send your crew in at gunpoint and demand they find treasure or choice B is ask the locals to help guide you through it.  You'd go with choice B, right?  Congratulations, your crew inexplicably now has syphilis.

The whole of the game is, in a single word, misguided.  It's as if Daviau looked at his past efforts and got the idea that tearing up components and marking up the board is fun in and of itself.  It's not.  If the entire premise of the game is "mark up the board", then you've completely missed the mark.  The draw of the legacy format is the evolution and progress of the game, whether the landscape changes or the players change.  Don't get me wrong, that stuff is in Seafall, but it's completely negligible.  If you're going to change the board or the players, then it should have at least some lasting impact, right?  No.  You get an extra die or some way to steal a point without earning it or... OR.... you get another island full of nothing, only now it's much harder because your one extra die isn't going to do jack squat for your efforts there.  

There ought to be progress and it ought to be tangible - in Seafall, it feels so incredibly pointless; you don't learn a whole lot and after 6 games, the big milestone achievements are so difficult to get to and if you don't get to them, you're still just dicking around with the local syphilis.  You'd think that'd be exacerbated by the legacy aspect, but no, instead you pretty much reset to such a basic level that you have to crawl your way back up just to even get to arm's length away from a milestone.  Oh, and that's probably when someone has "earned" enough points (meaning did nothing but basic actions and earned points because reasons) to end the game, so you're no further along than you were an hour and a half ago - and it still counts as a game played.

Let's break it down this way - if you can complete 15 games without anyone actually accomplishing milestones, then your game is fundamentally broken, especially if milestones are the way to make it move forward.  Games 5 and 6, in our case, were exactly that - nothing really got accomplished.  Someone won.  Big whoop.  We found an island.  Big whoop (I even named it Big Whoop).  All we managed to accomplish was having more spaces to look up in the book.  Snore.  The point is, nothing we did in those two games actually had any kind of real impact beyond making us sail farther away from home.  How is this supposed to be fun, exactly?  It's just so bizarre that the guy who came up with the whole format to begin with failed so miserably.  It's possible the other name on this page is part of the problem, but when you look at the box, there's only one name on it.

I get it, someone out there will love the hell out of this game because they actually think drawing on stickers is fun.  More power to you, but I suggest this - go find one of those vending machines where you can get a roll of stickers for like two dollars and mark those up instead.  It'll be much easier on your wallet and you'll have accomplished pretty much the same thing as Seafall does in a fraction of the time.  Want binary choices?  Flip a coin before writing on a sticker - heads, write on the sticker; tails, get syphilis.

Seafall: Wasted Potential

Played 11 games (plus the prologue) at which point my 5 player group collectively quit.

Mild Spoilers Warning

What Seafall does well is the Legacy experience. We were very engaged in our games, talked about the game in-between sessions, and wanted to know more. The flaw in the game is the series of obstacles that are put before the players - basically all the cool stuff is in the Booke, and it's very hard to access.

The incentives are all out of whack

The game is very good about making you hate it. The Event Deck in particular is wonderful at ruining your plans for your turn. For example, one card in particular reads "...that player's Westernmost ship is sunk." If you've ever had one of your ships sunk, it is a devastating event. Possibly ruins your entire game. Why are so many of the Event Deck cards terrible events? Why are there no incentives for say... ending your turn on an Unexplored Sea Space? There are a few incentive cards, but mostly the players are being punished, and I find that grinds away enthusiasm rather quickly.

How exactly was this playtested?

The rulebook is not overly helpful. Many games were paused while someone checked the forums. Have you looked at publisher Plaid Hat Games' forum? It's also terrible. Many, many questions have been addressed in a FAQ that's hosted here on BGG, but it seems that most of these should have been captured (and addressed) during playtesting.

And on a related note, I'm very curious about the "rubberbanding" effect of starting bonuses for being behind the leader. Does this work? or are there still runaway leaders? Our leaders tended to stay ahead regardless of the other bonuses (Veteran Stickers are OP?)

Overall a Frustrating Experience

I really wanted to like this game. And indeed we did enjoy the earlier games. But the more we played, the more obstacles to progress appeared before us. In the end we were frustrated and annoyed at almost every turn. This game is all stick, no carrot.

the experiences seem to be similar: Early games are interesting, then repetition sets in. Also there are some severe mechanical problems towards the end which I consider "breaking" the game - we played with 3 players, 2 were playing the normal pick-up-and-deliver building/trrading/buying treasure shtick, one was only exploring and basically collecting all relics and stuff alone. In the end we had collected so many colonies and treasures that each game only lasted for 2-3 turns maximum as each of us started with nearly all the VP needed to win. We then would attack each other for the treasures which mechanically is a merry-go-round - you lose some, then you win some. Nobody wanted to explore the final island because they wanted to surpass the other players in points first. We could have literally played forever but decided to call it a day and reveal the final island. We then found out that the player (SPOILER AHEAD) with the relics would have easily won, as each of them would have helped him get the successes needed. So at the end of the game you suddenly find out that there was only one winning strategy all the time and that is (SPOILER AGAIN) exploring like hell (literally). Towards the end the game becomes so cumbersome with mechanics that it literally grinds down to a halt. So a promising beginning (which I would rate 8-9) and a complete disappointment at the end, which doesn't work as a fun game anymore (rating 2-3), which gives my rating of 5. Mechanically the treasure cards (VP that you ALWAYS get at the beginning of a game once you have them) are a mistake in my opinion, the game would work better without them!

After prologue and 14 plays (through box 6 and last game): 
Game length: 7, 10, 9, 12, 9, 10, 8, 4, 8, 8, 8, 6, 7, 5 rounds

Initially an 8, then a 6, now rated a 4 after completing everything.  While there are things to like in the game, it ultimately was a let down.  For a story driven game, the storyline needs to shine and be intertwined in everything.  It wasn't, or when it was, there wasn't enough of a payoff.  I liked the game engine, however.  The advisors, the actions, exploring/raiding, etc., just not with this particular storyline.

Overall, the game was just okay.  Things started off great, and the pacing was fine.  It was interesting to starting reading from the book and add stickers to the board.  However, about halfway through our campaign things got boring, in that we played 7 games in a row where we were just cycling through adviors to interrogate them, and to try and burn through all the tomb locations.  Doing some late game exploration on island sites was stupid since all it did was add a new site for wood or spice that would never be harvested.  After about game 9, we never bought any goods.

The first 2 boxes (raiding/colonies), while interesting, didn't need to be saved for unlocks.  You could have had those right off the bat.  Boxes 3-6 were more interesting.

Box 5 was a great addition with a Secret Society and a UV light to find hidden numbers on the cards.  What a novel mechanic.

After box 5 (game 6), we had 7 more games just trying to find the right advisors and to build up enough successes to find the last island.  That's way too long of rinse/repeat.

The storyline, while it had some good stuff in it, was not fully realized or intriguing enough.  Destroying the Society's temple and rebuilding it didn't really amount to much, killing the Pirate King of Patmos was a non-event, and even closing the gate to Hell were treated like 'Oh yeah, we did that.', with a period at the end instead of an exclamation point!

Improvements:
- all players can keep 1 upgrade/building worth 10 gold or less.  This would get your engine moving faster and make things more interesting quicker
- game winner can keep 1 advisor, but all other players can keep 2 advisors
- once box 5 comes out, the economy needs to change in that you can automatically buy/sell 3 or 4
- colonies are always active
- each hidden tomb entrance requires just 1 tablet to open.  Needing 3 means you need to potentially raid multiple people and hope you get a combination that's on the map.

"Indiana Jones in the age of sail" - Rob Daviau.

Well, it even includes fortune and glory.  However...endeavours and milestones are swingier than Indy crossing a chasm with his whip.  And the game somehow manages to be both too long (several hours per game) and too short (not enough turns to really get going).  Yet it's a compelling ride. 

So - Indy?  Kind of.  But we all wanted another Raiders of the Lost Ark, and this is closer to Crystal Skull. Moments of excellence and some great twists, but too many dodgy elements for it to be as amazing as it could/should have been.

A heavier legacy game, with more American influence than Euro. Expect lots of luck, big changes along the game,  lots of adventure and rewards to those that are daring. It is flawed with a slightly long playtime, especially if your group is prone to analysis paralysis. 
If you have an open mind and don't mind heavier board games then Seafall is a treat and will provide months of fun. Don't try to play too many games in short succession, it will lead to player burn out. We kept a biweekly schedule and as a group where always hungry for more.

The game thus far is very reminiscent of 'Merchants & Marauders' and 'Tales of Arabian Knights' and if this trend continues I might very well enjoy the narrative this game gives us over 15-20 plays or so.  It is much heavier than Pandemic: Legacy, which is exactly what I was looking for.  (I was happy to play P:L but it didn't feel that much more than 20 games of overloaded vanilla Pandemic.)  I can tell now that this game is going to live or die on its narrative storytelling - so we will have to see.  I am hoping the mechanics don't get in the way. I'm already a little wary of the number crunching that goes into dice rolls and I'm hoping it doesn't bog down the experience.
-----
Second game and I've put my rating down to '6' from '7' (I have only played the Prologue and Game 1 so far).  I found the second game pretty much a repeat of the prologue except the easier explorations had already been taken so the game forces you into raiding and being a dick.  The narrative didn't advance in the slightest, which was a disappointment.  The mechanics are already feeling uninteresting.  And the "choose your own adventure" style apparently doesn't reward more for greater risk.  Looking at only one different path I could have taken, it turned out the safer bet brought the greatest reward.  Maybe this unpredictability in the narrative is necessary, but I would rather have a predictable, more risk/more reward system whereby you simply don't know the degree of the risk, which is where the unpredictability comes.  Decisions now feel arbitrary instead of risky.
------
Third game and I've put my rating down to a '5' from '6'.  No significant developments, no interesting storyline, terribly boring mechanics, overuse of dice, lots of downtime between turns, half the turns are boring "move" or "repair ship" and then it's another 10-15 minute way until your turn comes around again.  Nothing to do when it's not your turn.  Not interesting watching other people take their turn.  If this wasn't a Legacy game, it would have bombed right out of the gate. I'm only holding on, praying that something interesting happens storywise or that more rules and options come into the game that iron out the totally uninspired base rules.
-------
5th and final game. I'm done with Seafall.  Every second game it adds a whole additional module of uninteresting mechanics that still boils down to chucking 20 dice and hoping for the best. It's a dull, sloggy game, and the story is shit. I'd forgive the mechanics if there was a great story behind it, but the writing is so bland. Watered down "Treasure Island" bull-shit every step of the way. Keeps building to a "mystery" at such a snail's pace that by the time little plot points are revealed, I stopped caring about whatever else was revealed before it. At least Arabian Knights knows what it is: a completely random story-telling game for laughs. Seafall is a vehicle for storytelling as well.  But the game wants to be an epic Euro on top of all that, and it so much isn't that. The mechanics are completely uninspired. I don't know how many times I can re-word the fact that Seafall is the most boring "epic" game I've ever played. And I can say that because it tries to be the most interesting. The disparity between its intentions and its results is so gaping that playing Seafall is extra cringe-worthy. That's it. Also, I read the ending. Sounds completely effen stupid as all stupidness. Made me glad that I quit before that point. Now I just have to deal with the polite wrath of my friends! Sorry, buddies!

Several games in.  I'm still enjoying it some, but not nearly as much as I hoped.  The first few games were awesome.  However, the amount of bonus points for what are essentially random events are ridiculous.  We had one game were someone luckily got two milestone in rapid succession and ended the game in the first year.  We spent more time setting up and putting away.  Not fun.  And the tiny amount of forward progress between games is maddening; there is little sense of accomplishing anything other than exploration, and then it feels so much the same at every start.  Hopefully it will continue to entertain.

The mechanics are muddled, the successful strategies are impossible to foresee, your plans can be wrecked by the sudden appearance of new conditions, losing out on permanent benefits early is crippling, and the ending is basically Mass Effect 3 where all your decisions and permanent changes are rendered irrelevant for the final session. PLAY ANY OTHER GAME OTHER THAN THIS ONE.

RATING: 8
The first two Legacy games (Risk and Pandemic) both turned me off for various reasons related to IP/genre. Even so, the concept of legacy-style games was fascinating to me from day one and Seafall was the legacy game I was waiting for... a Euro!

As I write these comments (4 plays in) I have nothing negative to say about the game other than it does need to be played regularly and consistently to work best, and my group (my immediate family) hasn't done so. It has unfortunately fallen flat for some of us, but I have enjoyed every play and hope that we can overcome the obstacles to finish it.

Stay away from this one. It fails in its design goals, both stated and implied. Players are constantly (albeit equally) punished instead of rewarded for pursuing mandatory goals. The dice element is incredibly swingy, ranging from huge point gains to an effective game loss in a single roll. Far from being a sandboxy, open-world 4x, the goals put your game completely on rails. Moreover, the next "on rails" goal will be completely different, meaning if you specialize, you will be punished. But if you don't specialize and someone else does, they will run away with at least one game. A score of 15, 4, 4, 3 would not be rare at all in this game. A player who achieves a milestone not only gains 2-4 times more points than one can typically gain on a turn, but also will get even more bonus points from the story book in most cases. Story is completely lacking, with only very vague hints for hours upon hours of gameplay. It's not engrossing, it's a complete slog. This game represents a complete misunderstanding of what makes Legacy games fun.

Have played through about a dozen games and opened all but one of the boxes.  The game has been very popular with our family although one family member who is a very competitive gamer tends to have analysis paralysis and doesn't like the amount of randomness in the game.  They kept wanting to play though which is an indication that the game has a draw for even this type of player.  I really like the ability to play different styles from game to game and to be able to adapt in game to various unexpected events.  The combination of a euro style economy builder with the american style warfare game was pulled off pretty well.  A worthy step forward in the development of legacy style games.

RATING: 7
So after the prologue and first 2 games (and getting 2 secret boxes opened) I have enjoyed this game very much.  It is a bit fiddly in the sense that referring to the captain's book so often does slow the game down, and the choices there are usually not very compelling.  The rulebook has HOLES, not big ones, but ones enough to require some BGG research to understand rulings.  It's not a tight, clean ruleset.  But the game itself I have enjoyed so far.
Update.  After more games.  Still fiddly.  Still fun.  Like the mechanics and changes that have come in 5 open boxes.  Trying to get it finished.  It is a long game.

Overall I find this game a lot of fun to play with my regular group. Customizing the board and advisers always ends in lots of laughter.  There are definitely some pretty noticeable problems with the rules and gameplay/progression  can be pretty slow.  I wish the story was a bit more cohesive but generally the world of the game is interesting and encourages exploration.  Additionally there are several plot twists that make this game quite exciting as things progress.

The game is a first of its kind in being a new legacy game not based on an existing game and for that it does a fairly good job of providing a 4X experience where players don't know what to expect. Unfortunately coming off of the heals of the very popular Pandemic Legacy, players would be best to approach this with low expectations. The thematic story just doesn't come to life that well and as a competitive game, it has been my experience that players get too bogged down with optimizing the mechanisms that the story itself is lost and not memorable. The decision making and planning is difficult and time consuming and each session tends to conclude faster than it should in terms of turns, but slower than it should for the experience had. Some of this may be due to playing a five player campaign but other than shorter games, I don't think less players would improve the experience that much. My recommendation is to avoid this game unless you are willing to accept that there is a good possibility of flaws and are willing to struggle through the challenge of unanswered rules questions that are difficult to research spoiler free.

RATING: 7
Currently playing through it.  I think the game suffered a bit from overhype and that led to poor reviews.  It definitely falls short of expectations created by people projecting Pandemic Legacies success onto this game.

When our campaign group plays this game we make sure to keep things interesting by playing pirate music in the background and passing around a pirate hat that lets us know whose turn it is and who to yell at when they don't make quick moves.

I think I'm just going through the motions at the moment. I'm kind of getting fed up with having to check BGG during a game for rule clarifications, and tired of these stupid curve balls that the game keeps throwing at us. And while I'm 10 pts above the last place player, and 10 points below the two tied for first, I have yet to win a game.

Really wanted to like this, but it's bad.

The Legacy stuff is cool.

Enmity is a brilliant idea.

But the game is bad.  As a euro, it isn't interesting.  In general, it seems to be designed specifically to create a ton of feel-bad moments.  Maybe some players will find those "exciting," be I have found them awful.

The game takes flack for rules ambiguity, but for a legacy game designed without any time tested game play template to graft on to it does pretty well. There are definitely moments in the game where you can't demand too much rules guidance, but it definitely captures the feel of exploration.

While the game was exciting at first, the game mechanics just kill any hope of enjoyment by ~game five. A bad mix of Euro and ameritrash, not even a 4X. If you like self-flagellation, this is the game for you.

I tried, and tried, and tried to like this, but it has so many problems. It seemed like every single game I discovered another reason to dislike Seafall. The encounters were dull and badly written. The win conditions were swingy, unpredictable and unsatisfying. It's imbalanced. There is no sense of positive progression in the campaign - the only things that carry forward are handicaps, and players can get shut down for multiple games in a row. I got maybe 80% of the way through the campaign before admitting it wasn't worth wasting another night on. Even a big "twist" in our final game felt like too little, too late. If I hadn't been trying to see through a campaign with friends, I wouldn't have played this more than twice.

Interesting idea, generally love legacy games, but the legacy aspect here is poorly executed. Toward the end of the game, rules are added that have no basis in the main game, and seem to be added in just because they seemed cool.

The Legacy mechanism is a sustainability nightmare that devalues a board game worse than driving a new motor vehicle off the parking lot, and like a used car salesmen the publishers are laughing their way to the bank. A short term narrative gain is not worth the loss of replay ablity

I completed the entire campgain with two others (three players total). My experience was like so many of the longer reviews already published. The game is a great idea and very, ambitious but doesn't live up. The first half is definitely better than the latter half. By the end you are troubled by so many vague rules, ambiguous guidance, excess of boring event cards and advisors, and swingy shifts in power a lot of the early thrill is gone. The final end was the biggest disappointment, and why, in the end, I cannot say I like the game. Only reason I don't rate it lower is because the early games were so enjoyable.

Seafall scratches an itch that other 4X games don't in the fact that you can play a single game in 2 hours, and it feels like you got some cool stuff done.  Add in the Legacy components, and you have a game that grows with your group.  I don't recommend it for everyone, but if you want a "fast" 4X, this is a really excellent experience.

My group of four has completed six games of SeaFall, but it is looking less and less likely that we will finish it. None of the group has felt like the game's mechanics are compelling enough to want us to rush back to it due to feeling bound to repeating 
a committed strategy and the story is so far forgettable. I've heard it takes a few games for SeaFall to become interesting, but our group hasn't seen it yet. I can't recommend the game to others based on what I've played so far.

This game is much better than people give it credit for.
Legacy games (and decksploration games to some extent) in general are to be approached like an event -- a play, movie, book etc. In those terms, this game is an amazing, slowly building campaign. I'm not a tabletop gamer, but I love games like this because it flirts with that boundary in a very pleasing way. We're two games in and still excited for more.

Review based on 2 player with no PVP raiding.

There is a strong randomness/luck factor in some of the events and some of the cards/upgrades seem over powered.  In one game I discovered an island that destroyed one of my ships and damaged my other ship and set me back many turns because of my so called brilliant "discovery" - yet other island that were discovered were purely beneficial to the discoverer. 

Also, I will not go into spoilers but there were many events that occurred where a successful dice rule could mean the difference of many points.

We're five games into playing SeaFall, and I'm wondering if I want to finish it already. There's a certain epic adventure quality that keeps us going, and the Captain's Book is fun, but there are several things that I'm struggling with. First, the rules are brutal, and even after this many games we're still having to look stuff up all the time. Second, the downtime is bad with this game. Related to #1, it's a very complex game, and with four people struggling to maximize every turn, there's a lot of time between turns. Finally, I've never seen a game that frustrated this many people this often. The guy in the lead is the only one who hasn't come close to rage-quitting at least once, and I've felt like that twice. Really wondering right now if my friends would be disappointed if we stopped playing.

I really like this game! I think the low reviews are due to false expectations. This isn't the same game as Pandemic: Legacy. It's less narrative-driven and far more game-driven. It won't hold your hand and tell you a story, but it will deliver a swashbuckling experience that evolves over time.
If the idea of "SeaFall" appeals to you, you'll like it. If you're only looking at the "a legacy game", you may find yourself disappointed. Personally, I think it's a great combination. Solid gameplay, multiple routes to victory, excellent theme, and legacy to boot. Looking forward to playing more of the campaign.

RATING: 1.5
Played the prologue and three sessions then stopped. The story was very interesting. The mechanics were solid - nothing new and interesting other than enmity, which wasn't that interesting.

Strongly disliked the catch up mechanic. Winning should be encouraged and rewarded but this game heavily penalizes the winner of any given game and the winner overall. To me, this seems backwards. If one player plays better than another they should be rewarded with an advantage. Instead this game penalizes the better player and rewards the worse player. I understand this is done to keep the game fun for the worse player, but seems morally questionable, teaches the wrong life-lessons, and isn't fun for the better players.

Further, for us this lead to severe issues with gameplay where nobody in our group wanted to win. By game 3 when we realized how the catch up mechanic worked and how severe it was for the winner we literally all got to within 1 point of winning and then horded research cards (the only item that can be retained from one game to another). This completely broke the game.

It is appalling that the developer would include so many aspects of communism in his game and it is amazing how how well it captured those aspects and resulted so quickly in loss of motivation to succeed.

This is too much euro for a pirate game. It took many games for some players to remember the core mechanics because they were too busy trying to figure out how to get points.

11/10/16 - Prologue - 9
Prologue game was great fun for my group of 5. I really appreciated how light it was, letting you sink into the unique rules before really putting anything on the line. It took us about 2 hours, including a little bit of rules look up. We saved naming until the end which I think helped. My plan is to play no more than once a month unless group requests it. Will update rating as time goes on.

12/7/16 - Game 1 - 9
Really happy with Game 1. Eeked out a win, even with tieing next most prominent rank. We opened Box 1, which is exciting. I think Game 2 is gonna open the floodgates on raiding, though. That should be intense! Can't wait to play again.

1/18/17 - Game 2 - 9
Had a good if slightly frustrating time. A lot of questions about raiding and enmity that I feel like I understand but always takes me a moment to explain. The questions and ambiguities bog the pace down a bit. Games consistently 3+ hours with 5 players. Need to speed up. We opened Box 2, which looks exciting, but not sure how much it will come into play next game. I'm still excited about this game but wish the rules were clearer. Might be because endeavors and enmity are so unique, though.

2/16/17 - Game 3 - 9
Passing the advisors around helped immensely with our time issues. It was still 11 turns in 3 hours, though. No idea how people are doing this in 6-8 turns. Some fairly epic turns where people claimed milestones after using their bonuses and advisors nicely. I've slipped into last place. The most distracting bit is that I'm the rules guy for this and it's hard to concentrate on my own strategy while making sure everyone is playing correctly. 

3/15/17 - Game 4 - 9
Whoa after slipping into last place after Game 3, I vaulted into first place by claiming 2 milestones in 2 turns that hit a huge windfall of glory enhanced by appropriate advisor bonuses. I think the rest of the group was a bit disappointed that I made 10 glory in my final turn, but it was an eye opening experience.

5/31/17 - Game 5 - 8
Still finding the rules to be the biggest hindrance on this game, so much so that I'm dropping down to an 8. I personally am having a great time and enjoy the gameplay but it's a beast to manage this game. Constant barrage of questions and clarifications. 

Game 6 & 7
Still personally having a lot of fun with this, but the ambiguities are tough game after game. Constantly hunting down clarifications. My group is not playing very aggressively, so they are frequently caught with things very uncompleted when game ends.

Played the prologue and game 1 so far. Really enjoying it.

Game 3 update: still enjoying it. Worth noting that it still feels like we're "setting up" in some ways. I enjoy that, not everyone will.

Game 6 update: Enjoying it more than ever. Still only unlocked 3 boxes, but that is about to change. If my current enjoyment holds, I would be willing to pick up another copy to play, sit in for another player who's absent one week, and so forth. It's currently at an "always willing to play" 10.

After game 9 I am downgrading a bit to a 9. Still excited about it but looking towards the next game it feels like we've run many of the options pretty close to dry and are likely to be in for a very grindy few games coming up while people try to gear up for the final push. Still, there could be some surprises in store.

After 10 or 11 games, we stopped playing as a group and opened up the last boxes. I would be willing (even excited) to try it again, but I don't think the rest of my group would.

RATING: 6.9
Close to being special! Turns can be way too long with the wrong group, people really need to stay on their toes. Also, the first few games reward a very specific playstyle (you can choose to be a raider, merchant, explorer, builder etc.), and so if only one person is taking that approach, they will have a commanding lead. The catch-up mechanic does not effectively counter the victory rewards. Great theme though, and still can be fun if you lose.

Started our first game of SeaFall although it was only the prologue. Have a pretty good feel for the game now. Hope it plays quickly now that we have the rules down but we'll see. I fear the game will drag and the campaign will go on too long. I wonder if legacy games should aim for hour play times in general.

[u]Comments:[/u]
I was lucky enough to pick this up at GenCon, and it is also the first Legacy style game that I have played. I read with trepidation some of the first reviews that warned of a game that was just okay. After playing in three games I can honestly say I have no idea what they are talking about. I have found every game tight and thrilling from beginning to end. The mechanics are solid and the legacy elements are fantastic. I really feel like we are building a world in front of our eyes as we play. The components are pretty well done except for a few questionable graphic design choices (why on Earth would you use a script font for paragraphs of text that need to be read? And the illustrations for the advisers are mostly just plain awful and look like Bob from accounting). 
I do have a problem with the rules though. The rulebook definitely needs a glossary or index as there are number of small rules hidden throughout that are easy to forget, or overlook. 
All in all this game has been so much fun to play, hopefully it will continue to be so. I will update these comments as my campaign progresses.

RATING: 9.75
From a mid-development version playtest, one game session only so far, I'm giving this a 9.75... only Here I Stand and Chess do I rate so highly.   Some of my rating is based off of the gleam in Rob Daviau's eye when he hints at unlocks or changes to come in our multi-game play through.  

I won my first game which is enough to get me really addicted anyway, to any game.  All that being said, this I think is going to be a far richer game world by the time we are done than was Risk Legacy (which I loved and rate a 9.0).  WOOT WOOT

I picked this up to play with my brother and my girlfriend, as we all live in the same building. We get together to do it roughly once a week. Through 10 games, I'm absolutely hooked on it. My brother texts us about playing every other day. My girlfriend is leading, but we're all within 8 'glory' of each other.

This isn't like another game I've ever played, and I strongly recommend it if you have a circle of friends who want to regularly get together for seafaring adventure! It really helps to lean into the story sincerely.

Imperfect, but includes types of reasoning and decisions that I rarely (never?) get to explore in a board game. Successful blend of probabilities, inference, and strategy. Plus, with the right group it lends itself to lots of storytelling, suspense, and laughter. Must enjoy some randomness, can't be too focused on "the best play always wins".

PROVISIONAL RATING & COMMENTS
-------------------

After playing the Prologue and the first full game, I can say that I was completely surprised as to how much fun this game is. I had zero expectations for it as I hadn't followed it much, but it is super engaging. 

The choices made in the game are simple yet critical. Naming advisors and islands and EVERYTHING is great fun. And reading the passages of the story do a fantastic job of weaving the tale of the these nations as they embark west into the unknown. The finality of decisions is brilliant.

Maybe I was smitten with this game as it is the first of these "legacy" games i have experienced... so we will see how it holds up.

Now up to 5 sessions and rating was moved back down to 7. My God the randomness, it burns, it burns us my precious. After this many games we still are kind of flailing about. Strategies can be completely undone by one bad roll or one bad card. The games are short in number of turns, but still take around 3.0 to 3.5 hours with 5 players. That means that when your plans get derailed you might wait 30 minutes between turns to get a chance to say, I sail and I tax with nothing else to be done. One bad decision or bad luck can make the difference between 12 vp or 5. I still enjoy the game... mostly but frustration is growing

I've played 5 games of Seafall so far. Sadly the experience is not improving as we play more. There are too many things in this game that hinder it from being a good game.

No longer interested. Several reviewers have stopped playing halfway through and seemed not overly impressed with the game. In particular, the story book part is supposedly boring as it cannot affect the existence of non-existence of anything. Much of the game seems to be cube trading and a little aggression. Considering that one needs to play for a while before the essential rules are out, this seems boring.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
The rules are terribly written, spent so much time trying to decipher them it wasn't funny.  The general play was pretty good, but we spent a lot of games near the end wondering what we were supposed to be doing to progress the game.  One player spend 3 games doing the same thing over and over to try and move forward!  And the end was really disappointing.  It could have been a really good game, and improving the rules would go a LONG way towards this.  But as it is I wouldn't recommend playing it.

Now played 4 full games - And days when we can't play, I'm still thinking about it and how I could start the next game out.  My group is still really enjoying it.  Currently 9

Game 6 update:  Downgrading to an 8 due to rules ambiguities, need for clarifications, PRODUCTION ERRORS etc.  This game needs an OFFICIAL FAQ/errata sheet badly.  The unofficial one on BGG is helpful... but without the stamp of officiality, people still continue to argue and debate over what the "intended" purpose of things is.

Just started our campaign. This games seems to have a solid structure, if not mind-blowing. Going to have to adjust as we go through this one.


UPDATE: Dropped from a 7 to a 6 after campaign was completed. We ultimately rushed the endgame to unlock all of the material, and the final play through was truly a letdown. This game was maybe a little better than pedestrian, and certainly not worth 30+ hours of my time. If you get really wrapped up in the story element, I can see specific groups of people enjoying this. 

Going to try not to let this sour my outlook on legacy gaming as a whole, but I have to admit I'm a little nervous going forward.

RATING: 7.5
This game starts at a slow pace, good for learning the rules at their most basic so that the group can pick up the new rules later on with no problem. I really enjoyed my first game. It has what I expect from a board game with a sailing adventure theme.

That said, this game is NOT for players who are prone to AP. Of course, those types can make any game feel like a waiting hell. There are lots of choices for each player, even in the Prologue that gives the game a sense of freedom. Or agoraphobia, for some.

Anyway, can't wait to play it again!

Edit: The point system can be really painful for some players, and there are some elements of randomness that can result in unfortunate changes to the board. Not knowing how the game works at the start might also pigeonhole players into a specialization that they may not have wanted to go with for the entirety of the legacy game. It's not too difficult to switch tracks, but it may be enough of a hassle to feel frustrating for some.

I'm sad to say this is a terrible game. Designing around the legacy idea is fine if you have a good base game. The base game is dull and long. There wasn't a point in the entire campaign after the first two games that I wanted to play more, but was forced by peer pressure to finish it all. The entire group wish they hadn't by the end.

WARNING: SPOILERS PRESENT IN THESE COMMENTS!

I'm really enjoying this game so far. The game play, at first, was like a 7, but as the game is starting to unfold for me, I'm forcing myself to bump it up to an 8. Don't believe the reviewers that are lukewarm on this one; this game is fantastic. It's not quite at the level of Pandemic: Legacy for me yet, but it's well on its way. I will say, however, that the rule book is a mess. It's literally laid-out in reverse of how most rule books are presented. That aside, this scratches a very similar itch to games like Above and Below and Xia, but this one is actually better than both! Also, the twist at the end of the prologue was pretty awesome. I'm three games in, and while I still think a few aspects of the game are in their infancy, this is just a really well-designed system that combines pick-up-and-deliver elements (Something I'm not normally a fan of) with storytelling in a way that really works!

----

8 games in, and this game is even better than I thought initially. Upping it to a 9.

The game did drag a bit after the first few games, but the progression of the story along with the addition of the temples has made this game amazing. There are still some problems. Exploration definitely seems to be the way to go, and if you're not keeping each other in check, it can be very easy for a runaway leader to develop that steamrolls their way through multiple games. If you go into this for the experience, however, it's going to be a blast. It's going to be a long time before I can open the last box, I think, but I'm alright with this since I have a bunch of backed-up achievements from past boxes that still need completed.

---

Finished the campaign at 13 games plus the prologue for a total of 14, though admittedly the final game was more of a grind than anything else. I have to say, the destination was not nearly as interesting as the overall journey. The game starts off slow, then you have a common enemy in the pirate king, then there's the discovery of tombs to explore, and the next step after that is just an abrupt ending once someone discovers the final island. It's just very anti-climactic compared to the rest of the game. There's no happy ending or any sort of conclusion to what happens. You just end up unlocking this extra game that you can play after it's all said and done, which I think is just bogus.

Don't get me wrong, I like that they learned their lesson from Pandemic: Legacy, and made it so you can play after the legacy aspect is over, but for what? Leading raids against the apocalypse in some half-assed aftermath scenario? The exploration is gone, the advisers are gone, and all that's left to do is play a sorry excuse for a semi-cooperative game.

I really enjoyed my playthrough of Seafall, despite what happens after an emperor is crowned. There is a lot going on in this game, but I think that is designed to cater to different gaming groups. Does your group like to fight? There are combat and raiding rules here. Does your group like to explore? There are plenty of opportunities for that. Does your group like resource management Euros? There's a fairly decent pickup and deliver system here. At the end of the day though, Seafall does feel pretty half-baked. The story here is decent, but isn't as fully-realized as it ought to be. Even though I enjoyed exploring different islands while learning about what all these dark omens were referencing, it culminated in a really unsatisfying way. This game started out as an 8 for me, then fell to a 6, rose to a 9 soon afterwards, and now I think I'm happy bringing it back to an 8. Pandemic: Legacy is a better Legacy game, though I do think that Seafall is a better design to play through over and over again. Pandemic may have the twists and turns to provide a strong narrative, but I like that Seafall has this big, open world to explore. Even if most of what you run into are natives, ancient tombs, and/or pirates. I'm happy I played through this, and if asked to do so again I might, but probably not for awhile. I think this will land in my top 10 for 2016, but over time I feel like it will probably fade into obscurity. This is a game I recommend playing, so long as you're okay playing a heavier Euro with a hefty dose of luck for long periods of time. There's nothing else out there quite like Seafall, and it has given me an experience I'll remember for a long time to come.

Absolutely LOVE Legacy games.  Rob Daviau is my hero!  This game was enjoyable and I put it on tier with Pandemic: Legacy. (Before anyone accuses me of blasphemy, know that I am more of a competitive gamer and so Pandemic: Legacy, while a great game, didn't give me that strategic high I crave.)  That's not to say this game is perfect by any means. 

First my complaints:
- Glory points for milestones were way too high
- Because of the first item, gameplay (which I thought was rich and diversified) was more or less dictated by the milestones.  They were basically the only way to win and the permanent bonuses they often included would let the rich get richer.  Lots of ways to play, lots of strategies to use, but the only viable ones were to go after milestones.  If someone beat you to it...might have just wasted a few hours of your life with very little to show for it...
- Because of the first two items, there were numerous buildings, upgrades and advisors that were simply NEVER used...
- Took a fair amount of forum surfing on here to get clarification for rules.
- Not enough permanent enmity stickers for everyone, also a little too difficult to get rid of them in our case.  It made raiding a more difficult path to victory.
- Some of the unlocks and story progression were a bit tough to find.  Or stumble into.

Now my praise:
- The most mind consuming game I've ever played.  I would spend most waking moments (and some dreaming moments) obsessing over the game.  Trying my best to plan my next game out in it's entirety.  Obviously it never went according to my plans, but it was how much it drew me in that I loved.
- Fantastic, unique gameplay mechanisms.  Loved all of it.  Only would've tweaked the balance a little as mentioned above.
- I'm such a sucker for the Legacy elements.  Don't much care for the story line honestly, I just love the suspense of introducing changes and new rules!

Bottom line, Legacy games are the most amazing thing to happen to the board game world. Ever.  This one was mediocre as far as Legacy games go.  But still a Legacy game. So, 8!

I like the legacy aspect, the story telling narrative and many of the mechanics.

It's fun to play with my friends, because playing with my friends is fun, but I can't recommend it as a good game.

Sacred Bovine.  This game is amazing.  Sure it's got the problems everyone knows about - storyline wording, hoses the leader, blah, blah, blah, but overall it's my favorite game.  If you like to name your Home Province, ships, islands, advisors, main player characters, etc, etc, you'll very much enjoy this.

It's VERY detailed....  Confusing at times.  However, even when I am not the top player in a game, I can't wait to play the next game......

Definitely play with the same 5 players through the entire campaign.  If you only play one or two games per month, it'll take you a year to complete.

For the money - again, if you have 5 consistent players to count on (including yourself of course!!!), for $50, that's the cost of a video game and I've paid that much for video games that I've played for 4 hours....  This will literally be 1 to 2 hours (or more) per game and you've got 15 or 20 games before you complete the campaign, so, let's say 15 total games times 2 hours per game, that's 30 hours, now multiply that by 5 players and you get 150 combined hours of game time with friends.

I will say though... this is competitive... If you want a similar experience and I mean similar NOT exact... the Pandemic Legacy is for you.  But if you like a little friendly competition, have 5 people to play with consistently and are a medium to high level gamer - GET THIS GAME!

So far, so good... I'm playing with peaceful friends so there isn't any raids against other provinces nor sinking ships...
We are on 5th se session and I can say I'm enjoying the game. 
Some cons:
-difficult to understand rulebook
-it may be a problem if you have "alpha gamer" that is aiming for victory and not for story
-in most session you won't open new chests and in some session you open two of them which results in lots of new rules and content

I love the theme. I love the legacy. There is a prologue event that occurs which is amazing, but I'm not sure about the game itself. I am not a fan of the very small part of the game that carries over from game to game. So out of the gate, I'd say this is not going to replace Pandemic Legacy as my Legacy game of choice.

It's a bit ponderous, and game turn order is critical with so few turns in the game (to begin with) and can be game-defining. Meaning you really can't afford to take any path the players in front of you are following as you'll always be trailing to the best spots. But I want to like it and I'm looking forward to seeing how it opens up and the directions it takes with the legacy aspects.

A Disposable (aka "Legacy") game. Play through it, and throw it away. It's not like Sherlock Holmes, where after you have played the cases, you can't replay them, because at least with SHCD you can sell or give the game to someone else. And if you buy a disposable game and don't like it after a couple plays, you can't trade or sell it. I hope this fad doesn't become popular. 

The game itself is officially 3-5p, but apparently plays ok with 2, if you're ok with less interaction and more abundant resources. Game play is both long (1.5-2.5 hrs) and swingy (dice rolls for resolving some actions), although you can play low-risk.

This isn't a game. It can't have been playtested. I went all the way through with my group, and while I have some good memories and there were some good moments it was ultimately arbitrary, swingy, and definitely muddled. When we were especially annoyed by terribly written rules (I'd say at least once every time we played), the purple prose was just salt in the wound.

A “love it or hate it” kind of game. The rule book doesn’t make it easy to love because it is poorly-written and unclear. However, I like the scope and expansiveness of the game. To be honest, it has been some time since I have been as emotionally attached to the outcome of a game as I have this one. I will wait a bit before rating but I see more good in this game so far than I see bad.

Warning possible spoilers: The intro scenario is quite painful as it is long and it is basically a pick up and deliver game with not much interesting going for it. After playing the first main scenario it was more of the same, so I was really hoping the third game would be more interesting as the mechanics were fairly dull overall, as are the in between game upgrades and changes. As of game three the board was explorable but the game remained a pick and and deliver or a chance exploration. The main mechanic that helps is buying an assistant or upgrade, but it is slow to upgrade and benefits generally add dice, so just more chance. After three games and a lot of dull looks around the table I have given up and will not complete the game.

Don't buy this!The rulebook is one of the worst I've ever encountered, bundled with the added difficulty of trying to find clarifications online while carefully avoiding a minefield of spoilers. It's also horribly unbalanced, with certain strategies just becoming objectively better as the rules and objectives change throughout the campaign. And the randomness can be frustrating as two players can take the exact same actions on their turns and end up with either balance shifting, permanent upgrades... or a couple of pennies for the same amount of effort.

All of those complaints aside, though, I don't regret playing it. It's had some truly memorable plot and mechaniek twists, and personalizing the board and cards over time really makes the game feel like something that belongs to your group. Just be prepared for frustration along the way, and don't go into it with a super competitive power gamer mindset.

3-5. LEGACY adventure game. Too fiddly and overly complex due to too many rules. Boring for a legacy game? (Quoting SU&SD).

“

Maybe it's still good as a solo game because I like the story telling aspect. Still on the fence about this one.

This was designer Rob Daviau's next stab at a Legacy game following the runaway success of Pandemic Legacy Season 1. It has had lukewarm reviews, with several reviewers describing how they gave up on the legacy campaign half-way through, but it has kept three of us entertained so far.

Only 1 play of the prologue so far, but I hope the fun will increase significantly when playing the real game. After 1 play of Pandemic Legacy we all had the feeling 'we want more!'. NOBODY at the table had that feeling after playing the prologue. It seems all very dull for the moment.

Edit 12/05/2017: we stopped after 6 campaigns. The game pace is way too slow for us and games are too dull/repetitive.

My group was really motivated to finish the campaign. I was not. We all eventually no longer wanted to play.

We finally called it quits as we had played the same game 4-5 times in a row with no real direction to guide us to the end. 

After reading forum posts, it sounds like some of the rules and what you can and can not do aren't fully explained. We each had an idea of what we needed to do, but all previous rules explicitly said, you are now able to do this. The rule holding us up was more implied this is what you should be doing but never explained how the mechanic would work.

Very disappointing after putting so many hours into this that the entire game group was tired of dealing with it.

This needed a few more iterations of playtesting to properly handle the end game. The catch up mechanic worked well at the start, but as the game continued to go on, it just stopped working the way it was intended.

There isn't enough differentiating each person from game to game where you ultimately can't make up a big chunk of points compared to everyone else.

I wanted to like this game so much and early on it was enjoyed, but the deeper we went, the less it was enjoyed.

I can't wait to explore this game further- I have no idea what to name anything. I named a couple of islands in the game 1) Dragonstone 2) Hydra (LOST anyone?) :)

I did name one of my boats "Sea Bitch" :D

Good and bad. Enjoyable and frustrating. A glorious failure. Finished after 12 plays with a sense of relief that it was over: by the end we were ignoring the game end limit to further the story-line rather than play the game. There are some good moments in the game, but there are too many shaky elements - Glory awards, permanent rewards, ineffective catch-up mechanism, starting from scratch every bl**dy game - that bring the whole shebang crashing down.

Ambitious attempt, but poorly executed. The combination of poorly drafted rules and legacy mechanics makes for a completely unfun campaign. Huge swings coming from bland writing mean the game fails as a strategic challenge and roleplaying experience.

Played through prologue and one game now. Can't wait for the next game. Really good full of fun twists and exploration. A few issues are present, and the game is a bit of a slog as it takes quite a while to play, but was engaged and interested throughout. 

Update: Played through game 3 now. Continues to be interesting, but some aspects continue to be troubling. The luck can cause very big swings in glory, which is troubling for a game that feels like it is trying to be a long epic struggle with plenty of strategy. Still excited to continue playing.

Update 11/30/16: Played through game 5 now. The warts of the game have turned into full on frustrations. Not sure how many more games we will continue to play. Lots of very interesting things going on here, but lots of frustrating things too. Feels like a brilliant wonderful game is lurking here but is ruined by a variety of aspects. 

Final Update: Never did get around to playing more as group agreed it wasn't worth continuing. May work for some groups but in general this game has many warts that prevent it from being great. There are great ideas present in SeaFall but many parts that also have us shaking our heads. It is hard to know how to rate this as I never want to play again but a part of me does somewhat want to play parts of it again and the early games were great fun at first. So I'll settle on a 5 to represent it's an alright experience and not actually awful, but not a game I'm particularly impressed by.

I'm only partway through the Prelude with a game of five players, and we're having fun, but there are signs on the horizon that this could be a slog, as reviewers have mentioned. Let's see where this game goes. I could imagine my rating swinging +/- 2 points and ending up in the 5-9 range. My 12 and 13 year olds did not appreciate the downtime. Thankfully, they have mobile phones to use when it's not their turns.

By the time of this review, I am 9 games in and I really think this game is bland at best. Regardless if you win or lose (i have been consistently losing by the way) , it's not that I lose that makes me rate this game so lowly. Losing is fine. The problem is the streaks of randomness that come throughout the game. You will find areas of the game where you will come across ancient sites that give you victory points. Honestly, all by luck. This game is clearly driven by luck and rolls of dice. 

Have I been largely unlucky this whole game? No.. there are ways to mitigate your luck as well. Playing cards, rolling dice and adding upgrades to your ship are all part of the game. Upgrades you say? They aren't really upgrades if they are reset after each game. What? The only permanent upgrades you do get are the increases to your sail speed, hold, raid, explore attributes. Otherwise, i am quite disappointed with upgrades. The same goes with buildings, which are also tossed out at the end of the game. 

There is also a run-away leader problem that we must address. I remember that I was last place. The leader was at least 25 points ahead of me. Not in 1 game but throughout the whole campaign. The game tries to shovel a way for you to get back into it by offering a selection of advantages on every 5 points you were behind the leader. Did this help??... no. A lot of the luck in this game stifles any plans you make. The only sure fire way to get victory points is to buy and purchase upgrades/buildings as well as explore. Did i say that was all random too? Sure you can BUY all your items to increase your glory but this can be outdone by streaks of randomness, tombs, finding new islands, a very overpowered event that may surface upon exploration and raids. 

I was very disappointed by the raids skills in this game. I didn't think that going on raids benefited you especially if it was against the NPCs. You get enmity for attacks and every subsequent raid makes you more hated, driving up prices and spiking up all defenses across islands. Now isn't that something. There isn't really an efficient way to get rid of enmity so going on the raid route is entirely useless unless you want to steal items from your fellow players which also gives them enmity.  

The only part that I have been enjoying so far are the legacy aspects of putting stickers down and opening new things. Fine. These are great things that the designer has established in the past with Pandemic and Risk. But it doesn't work here. I would say that 99% of the time I am just curious about what happens next and that's it. I really don't feel close to my empire nor do i care so much about it. A lot of the exploration actions lack any real agency and choice because the writing seems to gear you towards really general decisions. Thematically this was interesting but doesn't work. 

I can't recommend this game with full confidence to anyone.

UPDATE after 11 plays, Seafail for sure.

Nothing has changed and it's still bland. Cool, flash your LED coolie light just to get more points. I think this was Rob's way of testing the waters without ruining pandemic legacy. Lesson learned, ey?

Long for what it is. The various strategy types don't feel competitive in later games. The catch-up mechanics can't balance the gains made by *run-away" leaders. Some riskier players may get a "DungeonQuest" feel for how bad some of the results can be. 

The artwork is engaging and some of the legacy elements work as intended; but mechanically there are issues and as the game grows in complexity players are going to have to agree to rules interpretations to avoid Spoiler FAQ's.

Not a game I'd purchase a second copy to play with another group.

RATING: 7.2
I had a lot of fun with this game, despite that fact that my campaign started with 4 players, dropped to 3 after about 6 games, then to 2 players at game 13, at which point we rushed the end. Short version: story was great, game was decent.

The storyline portion of the game was amazing. I had a great time discovering the story as we went and some of the reveals were mindblowing. I really felt invested in my province and it felt like we were exploring a dynamic world with forces beyond our control. Additionally, some of the actions you can take later in the game and the things you discover were really satisfying and thrilling. 

Biggest complaint is how quickly later games end. It forces a ruthless optimization of play, because one misplayed turn can cost you six glory at the end of the game. Additionally, I've found that past the middle of the campaign, games always end before the first winter. I think there's too much glory to go around, and games should either have higher targets or lower glory values. The issue with this, of course, is that there's a finite amount of material to play through, so I think to live up to its potential this game would need a lot more story.

Off the previous point, the strategy quickly becomes much simpler than you would expect. Of course there's still strategy around player interaction, but I think the game is very limiting later.

At the end of the day, I really enjoyed playing this game, but I feel like it fell short of its potential. If there were to be a Seafall 2 that worked towards fixing these issues, I would buy it and play it immediately.

Ok so here is the deal.  I played 1 game and my group collapsed.  It's up for trade.  Here is what I can offer if you are interested.  

I'll write a little story about what happened in that game.  

Here are the Legacy things affected thus far.
1.  3 events have been completed and ripped up.  Nothing that couldn't be worked around if you were determined to start over.  The first "Unlock" event has not been completed.  This means only 1 box has been opened.  The contents of this box would be in my story.

2.  Lots of stuff has been named.  We were determined to play the right way.  I could get some labels from office depot if you want to start over.

3.  One unavoidable thing has happened.  I would tell you in my story.  Spoilers and all I'm not putting it here.

4.  Bunches of stickers have been put out on the board assigning resources to locations.  Nothing really special about it and there are possibly.  There are probably enough stickers left over to take these off the board.

Risk was chaotic but interesting, as the very first Legacy game. Pandemic was a better design, yet repetitive and underdelivered on story content and twists. SeaFall was slagged in early reviews, so my hyped up anticipation dived close to realease, but after actually playing it myself I'm starting to enjoy it. More of a Euro than I thought, but I'm having fun.

Some points I don't quite agree with reviewers on: Play length; averages 3,5 hrs for our group, rather than 4-5 hrs as reported. Read-aloud texts being repetitive, flat and too general; couldn't disagree more. There supposedly not being a real game there until session five or six; we unlocked the full game at the end of the second session after the prologue. Nothing much interesting happening until session five or six; we've been happy with all twists and turns already from the beginning, after four sessions just as much has happened as halfway through the Pandemic campaign. You risking everything to achieve a milestone and gaining nothing from coming in second; true, but more games have been won from endeavour glory in our group, and milestone rewards don't overshadow other bonuses. SeaFall being a pedestrain Euro; it's got a little PvP, and there are many ways to win, even though it is rather Euroish. It being boring; up to personal taste, of course, but more interesting than Risk and Pandemic IMO, and you can't help pondering how it all went down, between sessions, and revising your tactics as new developments happen.

Bonus points for having a truly long perspective, you're always considering campaign consequences, and also for having excellent catch-up mechanics for players who miss a session or just play badly once in a while.

It gets old in the long run, though, when you pass the tenth session and likely have a runaway leader.

First 2/3rds of the game were great, lots of interesting ideas and genuinely interesting to play through. Last 1/3rd of the game was a complete slog. We gave it a number of games well beyond when it stopped being fun based on its previous merits, but ultimately we just couldn't make it.

The very end of the game seems like it would be fantastic and really interesting (based on what we discovered when we gave up after game 15). Unfortunately it just couldn't deliver fast enough.

The campaign was ground out with four sets of gritted teeth and a steely determination from the group to complete the story.  It wasn't worth the effort.

This is the Legacy game that wasn't; sure stickers were applied and things written upon, but why the reset to basics each time? Players could amass upgrades, buildings and cash, ready for a win, then someone else pips them to the post with a random gift of glory points and everything goes away.  Not fun.

Unfortunately, I bought two sets for two different groups so the torture continues for a while yet (though one player smartly bailed after five games).

Seafall is a complex game to rate. I enjoyed the early part of my campaign, but I also found it frustrating, and, ultimately, I cannot recommend it as a competitive experience. The end game is very poorly implemented on several levels, and dragged the game down considerably. I'm not satisfied with the balance, and many aspects of the game felt under-developed, which is odd in a game that went through so much development work. Now that I have finished my campaign, I will never play again. For comparison, I've thought about getting a second copy of Pandemic: Legacy, and playing through another campaign. 

Part of the issue is that at the beginning of the campaign, you have very little idea of the relative values of the different options. Initially, the 4 guilds are presented as more or less equal, but that isn't even remotely true. The merchant's guild is awful, the soldier's guild and builder's guild are decent, and the explorer's guild is king. You are encouraged to specialize to some degree with your ship improvements, although this aspect will converge back to similar builds later in the campaign. However, players will not be able to gain all of the same special abilities, and the balance of special abilities is very poor because of the guild imbalance. 

Only the explorer's guild feels really fleshed out, and while the rewards are semi-random, on average exploring is just better than the other guild actions. The rewards for exploration range from about as good as the actions of other guilds, to massive, game winning, or even campaign distorting rewards.  You can find huge piles of gold randomly on an island and suddenly snatch a milestone that another player spent the entire game building towards. Yes, at the beginning of the campaign you'll struggle to be able to explore, but someone that focuses on exploring can dominate it.

The soldier's guild is the second best, but it felt under utilized. There are pirates in the game, but the implementation was lackluster, and they didn't interact well enough with the soldier's guild. You are limited in how much you can raid, and until quite a ways through the campaign, raiding can easily have long term consequences, even if you focus on improving it. There are a few moments when you get to pull off big raids related to milestones, and you can often make 2 glory with a raid, but normally the rewards for raiding islands pale in comparison to the rewards for exploring high value sites. Raiding other players is difficult, and much more prone to long term consequences or short term retaliation. I'm glad that there are some limits to attacking other players, but if your opponent only cares about one of their ships, and they keep their ships together, there is no point in attacking their ships. They'll let you sink the ship they don't care about, and you won't have enough enmity to attack the other one. Not to mention that they will have so much additional defense from your enmity that you might as well go home.

The builder's guild was okay, but it was more of a payout for what you acquired through income and the other guild actions than a way to develop. It also felt a little unthematic. Why do I have to build a Port every few years in the same place? Isn't the one I had there last game doing the job anymore? Some more long term buildup would have made the game much more difficult to balance, but also much more interesting. In addition, the late game buildings can be worth too many points and distort the game.

The merchant's guild is pretty terrible. Spending a turn buying or selling goods starts out weak, and quickly spirals to abysmal unless you have a specific objective in mind. In addition, I'm unsatisfied with the implementation of colonies.

Contributing to this is the compounding factor of the milestones. The milestones push you in different directions, but pursuing the building/merchant milestones is only good for you if you manage to complete them that game. Many of those milestones can take many turns to complete, and if your opponents end the game before you manage to complete it, you fall behind. The big problem with this is that the game doesn't tell you any of this up front, so milestones can mislead you about viable paths to pursue. The potential rewards for exploration also scale up throughout the campaign, so it's not immediately apparent how strong it gets.

I like the idea of advisors, but the implementation had some problems. Due to some of the actions being valuable, and others being worthless trash most of the time, you'll end up with huge variations in advisor value. On the whole, that's okay, but it made taking okay advisors risky, since you might reveal an amazing advisor to your opponent. Later on in the campaign, the advisor deck bloats with too much junk, and you can run out of advisor upgrades that anyone cares about, which is a little disappointing.

The catchup mechanisms feel more like they're there to keep the score difference from growing too large than actually allowing a player that falls behind in the campaign to have a realistic chance at winning the campaign.

I didn't mind the story elements, although it often felt random whether you would get a better or worse result based on your story choices. The overall narrative is weaker than the narrative in Pandemic: Legacy despite having better individual story elements. Largely I attribute this to Pandemic: Legacy being more about a unified narrative arc, while Seafall is more of a hodgepodge of different stories. Yes, those different stories are related, but they don't offer the same sense of a cohesive narrative. 

The rules are needlessly ambiguous on many points. Games where it is more difficult to ask/receive answers to rules questions require clearer, more complete rule sets than normal, and Seafall failed to deliver in this regard. In particular, I think this is most important in a competitive legacy game, like this one. In a game like Pandemic: Legacy, even if you're not completely clear on a rule, you can decide as a group based on how you think it should work, and it will affect everyone together. In Seafall, unclear rules will often need to be resolved to the benefit of one player and the detriment of another. Not to mention that the rules for Pandemic: Legacy were on the whole much clearer. The rules never even cover how to handle several late game mechanics that are necessary to progress the campaign. The hidden information that starts to get revealed in the later portion of the campaign is very poorly implemented on the whole.

Played this last night for the first time.  The game is awesome.  The battle mechanics are simple and intuitive.  Exploration and battles are similar to building dice pools in X-Wing.  The ships and the board are beautiful.  We played with my friends metal coins that he upgraded to, and they are really nice, too.  The cards are nice, and they have some really nice art for the advisers. I cannot think of one thing we did not like about the game.  Since it was our first time playing, we did have some downtime while waiting for turns.  Many of the rules were discussed and we had to look up some of the finer points,  like do you repair all ships when you use the builder's guild or can you only repair one at time.  My favorite part of the game was the Captain's Log.  The entries all point to some mystery, and they all tie in together.  And, it was very well written.  This was my first Legacy type game, so I cannot compare it to others like it, but I am hooked on this one.

We're on our third game, and the game keeps getting better.  The prologue was important to learn the basic rules, but after opening two chests so far, there are more rules to learn.  Best to set aside 30 minutes after each game that you open a chest to go through the new rules.  We played game 2 and 3 back to back, and it wasn't too difficult to keep going, but after opening another chest, the additional new rules was a bit overwhelming, and I'm glad we didn't go for another game right after the second.  This is still an awesome game, and I'm pretty sure it's worth buying another box in order to do another play through.

I really think this game is getting a bad rap because it isn't a Pandemic Legacy clone. My group is really enjoying the story-telling aspect of the game.

RATING: 8
Great legacy game that introduces new mechanics and scenarios as you get deeper and deeper into the campaign. It's well balanced and has strong a come-back mechanism to keep the game fair and close over the course of your dozen or so sessions. My friends and I look forward to every session, although our only complaint is that some games can take an entire afternoon if we don't play fast.

Started off so promising. But now 11 games in, all boxes open save one, I agree with the Dice Tower folks.

-Too long
-Too random
-Too much downtime
-End game is a slog and very few new things are revealed. You go from opening a box every other 2-hour game to slogging through 4-hour sessions to make MINOR progress towards the end goals.

I give it a 7 because it started off as a 10, and now I would rate it a 3, so 6.5 rounded up.

- Too random.
- Unbalanced mechanics for a supposed 4X game. 
- In a 4/5 player game, the second ranking place is terrible as you don't get rewards for winning, but you are constantly punished.
- Inconsistent sessions, some games could last for 4 hours, while another could end in 1.5 hours, making all your plans useless with an abrupt end.
- Unclear rules.

Update: Game 5, Player 2 has reached the 15 VP target, with hard work. Then player 1 does something silly that gives him a 9 VP strike and wins the game from last position. Rage quit. Goodbye Seafall.

We are playing 5-player and are ALL REALLY loving it.  They say there is downtime but after two games we are all really absorbed in each others turn so we aren't noticing it much.  I'm watching others to see if it alters my turns possibilities. 

Love the advisors, Enmity, appellations, endeavours....the list goes on.

A fun experience, but mostly due to the people I'm playing with. It's a bit of a slow, repetitive build, but it [i]does[/i] build up into a mildly/moderately interesting game. It really could have benefited from picking the pace up significantly. 

I can't get over the choose-your-own adventure aspect that rewards you big points arbitrarily, but it does provide some amusing moments and fun table talk.

RATING: 5
A crazily ambitious game that IMO falls short.  The rich get richer, or at least the poor have a really hard time catching up. The ending games are kind of a clusterfuck. The length of the campaign exacerbates its flaws. In the end I gave up a few games before the campaign ended, and several of the games before that I just played due to a sense of obligation to the other players.

RATING: 9.5
I'll have to update this rating over time as I play it. I like the setting of the story and how reading the paragraphs does provide some color as to what is going on. I'm intrigued to see how the game develops over time, and need to play a couple more times before making a decision.

UPDATE: Now having a couple of actual plays under my belt, I like it. I don't think the system is super innovative anywhere, except that it is a well-done storytelling game where your choices in one game carry over to the next. I find myself looking forward to each upcoming play.

UPDATE #2: I am a bit concerned about where our last play left us, but will need to play a couple more times before I settle in on an ultimate rating, as I'm afraid the game may have brought our economies to a standstill. Nevertheless, the interesting choices brought about by how to employ your advisors and when to do them is something that is a bit novel, and I think that enmity is clever. Overall, I'm appreciating the design as well as getting together regularly with my friends to play it.

UPDATE #3: Simply a great game. It's excellent. There's lots of choices and paths to victory, and over the course of many games, every decision somehow seems to matter. I still think it may suffer a bit from a runaway leader problem, but as a legacy game, I think that's a challenging thing to work around.

UPDATE #4: I was finally caught, and so I do think it was overall a fun and enjoyable experience. Some of the rules were unclear, but if you're looking for a quality Euro that is also a legacy game, this is it.

Evolving rating...
- after first few plays: an 8! Wow, cool system, really want to see what happens!
- a few more plays: interesting, but kinda swingy in an annoying way: 7
- more plays: wow, I'm liking this less every time I play it!
- many more plays (we're up to game 17 now): I still want to see what's going to happen, play with my friends, etc. so a 4 for now, but in the end I'll NEVER want to play this game again! Plus, I'll look more seriously at another legacy style heavy game before purchasing unseen --> 2

So why do I dislike this game so much? See below...






SPOILERS

SPOILERS

SPOILERS







- Really, just one spoiler: it turns out that the game [b]heavily[/b] rewards exploration. You didn't happen to choose that strategy? Too bad -- it is kind of difficult changing gears later on! Could you have figured that out somehow? No, not really. Even though the vast majority of the board being unknown might be a good clue, you just naturally assume that there are multiple viable paths in a game of this length!
- The early games were shorter, but now it seems games can go on for quite a while (our average, with 4 players is 3.5 hours!). Actually, I don't mind long games -- in fact, I prefer them most of the time. The problem here is that even though it takes so long to finish a game, it feels as if you've not actually accomplished all that much! Most early games didn't get to second winter (not until game 15 or so), which means each player got at most 12 turns (7-9 turns more commonly early on)! 
- You're essentially starting from scratch every game so the early part of every game feels samey: build up your little empire again and again and again. And the good stuff gets further and further away from your home base, so a lot of that early game is just getting your shit out to where stuff is happening (or, if you're a raider, maybe out to where you don't have a ton of enmity)!
- The game is so SWINGY! Scores are bouncing around all over the place as people complete milestones or do lucky (random!) explores. People can score a huge number of points at once, trigger the end of the game, and make your last few actions completely useless! Surprisingly, 3 of the 4 of us still kept our overall campaign scores close to one another (the 4th player was so far behind, so frustrated and hopeless, she quit after game 16 or so)
- The RULES! OMG the F___ING RULES!!! There are so many questions, so many unclear things, you have to wonder if they actually playtested this thing! I know, in fact, that it was tested quite extensively -- apparently, just not very well! So much worse than the Halifax Hammer, which was a real problem for A Few Acres of Snow but which also would only be discovered by a very good, analytical, player who examines the board and design and plays the game repeteadly WAY more than any typical player these days. Even worse, there's STILL no official FAQ or rules update to clarify the pages and pages of rules questions on BGG. And EVEN WORSE, it takes for freaking ever to find any damn answer because of all the fuckin' spoiler tags!!! I get more and more annoyed just thinking about it! (This, and the fact that it's often weeks between sessions, is one reason our games take so long: it's a complex game and we often have to do some relearning every time we get together, lengthening that first game; if we're able to play a second on the same day, it's usually quicker.)

The [url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/71211/item/4861200#item4861200]SUSD guys had it right[/url]: you're better off buying the game, taking your time and opening all the secrets, reading all the text, then packaging it all up and passing it on to the next sucker!

Go play Risk Legacy or Pandemic Legacy instead -- FAR better legacy games!

RATING: 4
Great concept. Terrible implementation. Our group ran out of stickers and the rule book is very unclear when it comes to components that are added via the legacy element. Additionally, post release support would be nice due to all of the FAQ's from players, but not sure if there is one or where to find it.

I'm a big fan of the Legacy systems in games.  I've played both Risk and Pandemic Legacy before this and really the Legacy system is the only thing that kept me playing Risk Legacy which I ended up not really caring for.  Too much Risk.

This one however is in competition with Pandemic Legacy as my favorite Legacy game.  I really, really enjoyed this game after just one play which was even just the prologue (re: tutorial) adventure.  

The game is a sort of light exploration game with some pick up and deliver elements with a really neat choose-your-own-adventure storytelling device driving the story.  On a player's turn he chooses a guild which provides him with the options for actions he can do that turn.  Those actions are, mainly, exploring, raiding, going to the market, and building.  All of these actions give you points except the market and the goal of each game is to reach a certain point goal.  When you explore areas on the island the game has you read a passage in this big log book.  Almost all the passages give you a choice and you read the next passage based on which choice you choose.  This was really fun and engaging and I always felt like I had a whole host of options and different paths I could take.

And as for the story elements, even in the brief taste we got in the prologue there was a huge surprise.  I won't ruin it of course but it really got me hungry for more.

Unforgiving legacy system. Once you're behind, you'll never catch up. The balancing mechanic may allow you to win a game, but never with a large enough gap to make distance in the overall campaign. Even individual games are not worth the effort. Players can take the exact same action, with the exact same dice scores, and be rewarded with dramatically different game-swinging results. Disappointing.

This game will present you with several strategies you can pursue, and you will invest in one of those strategies, upgrading your tableau to maximize on that strategy. Then the game will change in such a way that all strategies but one are disallowed until an obstacle is overcome. Overcoming that obstacle is basically impossible, because the strategy to overcome it was neutered and the lone strategy that was unfettered has no incentive to overcome the obstacle. The end result: some players are no longer allowed to play the game at all. Do yourself a favor and just don’t play it to start with.

Basic game: move and do stuff to upgrade your ships/province and/or get glory points. Pretty straighforward. Then this game has three gimmicks added: campaign mode, 'build your own world' and finally the 'seasons' mechanic of Pandemic: Legacy which put down rule changes during the course of the game.

Now, I'll definitely won't buy this game. Why?
First, campaign mode is basically 'repeat the same stuff you were doing, adding in some legacy rule and go at it again'. Which is fine if the game is so great you'd want to play again and any legacy rule change would be bonus, but I simply don't see a great system in the first place.
Second, the 'build your own world' is perfectly sold as 'we'll put out stickers so you can plaster your map instead of providing you with (more expensive) card-board tokens. Yay! It only allows 'ease of saving' in between campaign modes, so yes, I can see why it's included, but this whole campaign thing would be better served with different environments imho.
Third, the legacy rule changes. Granted, it is a cool mechanic, rightfully copied from Pandemic: Legacy. It is like having the rule-expansions/variants already baked in to your game when bought. Great. Only caveat is when played through you're pretty much done with this aspect of the game as the excitement of discovery is gone.

Brings me to the final point: the basic game should be good enough to replay on its own. THEN the legacy mechanic is a huge bonus, as it adds even more replayability and breathes freshness into a proven concept.

This game though, not so much. If the legacy mechanic wasn't there, would it hold up? I don't think so, it would find it inferior to f.e. Merchants and Marauders (which has the same theme) or Eclipse (which has a strong discovery mechanic but a much better engine) or Puerto Rico (which is driven by role-selection but has a clear focus on 'building your province'). Now, if one of THESE games would come out with Legacy mechanic (just as the very accessible and highly replayable games of Risk and Pandemic already did)... that would be another story. And I fully expect to see those in the future.

For now, for this game, I'll pass as I don't think the basic game itself is strong enough to really keep me engaged.

Vin d'jeu: french review of SeaFall http://www.vindjeu.eu/2017/03/12/seafall/
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
So, I'm now 9 games into SeaFall and I've dedicated about 24 hours of my life to playing it. I was a huge fan of Rob Daviau's work on Heroscape and so, along with the excitement of legacy games, was intrigued to see what SeaFall would become.

Sadly, the answer to that question is that SeaFall is a blubbery mess of a game, full of clunky rules, wonky interaction, tedious downtime, amateurish fluff text and almost no meaningful decisions.

An example of a game: I had collected a variety of maps that assisted me in exploring a temple, so set out at the start of the game to head straight for the nearest one. My ships are heavily upgraded for speed (sail 4 each), so could get the temple in 2 or 3 turns. Having successfully explored the temple (roll 11 dice - count successes!), I took enough damage to one of my ships that the most sensible thing to do was return to port to repair That took another 3 or so turns. At which point the game ended after 3 and a half hours.

So my decisions in that time: To head for the temple (1). To return to port before trying anything else (2, though basically a non-decision because of the damage I'd taken).

That is two decisions (if I'm being generous) in 3.5 hours. That is not enough player engagement.

I genuinely dread the prospect of more games of SeaFall. I've played worse games, but I've never had such a disparity between anticipation and experience before.

I like legacy games a lot...and the setting is great.

Update: We're through game 2 with 5 players. (I'm tied for last with 16. Scores range from 20 to 16.) So far so good.

Update2: Game 3: Scores range from 30 to 18.  (I'm in second with 29)

Going with a tentative rating of 8 thus far. I'm definitely enjoying it and looking forward to the next game.

We are only 6 games in at this point.  I'll update this later if I feel I need to.  So Far it has been fun, we are on the verge of a runaway leader problem.  It seems like my strategy based on building structures and upgrading ships might be too easy a route to glory compared to exploring or raiding.  Rating 8/10

*Update*
9 Games in.  Runaway leader problem continues.  The balancing mechanics are taking a toll.  It is hard for the leader (me) to win a round, but I always end up in 2nd place only 1 or 2 behind the winner.   The unlocks have been interesting, but to some extent underwhelming.  There was an unlock that fundamentally re-balanced the game mechanics away from certain strategies, and it felt like we were about to stall out, and have a very, very slow round, but instead several Milestones were easily accomplished, and the previous game mechanics were restored.   I can't help but feel like the designers didn't make great use of the map.  There are a few rules that are confusing, or that we just played wrong, and that is always frustrating, but we've gotten past it.  It feels like we are quickly moving through the game at this point, and I struggle to see how it will take 6 additional games to finish it.  In some ways, I'm enjoying the games more at this point.  In others I find myself a bit let down.  I'm keeping my rating the same for now.  8/10.

RATING: 5
It turns out it's just a very mediocre game broken in to separate boxes and slowly introduced. Some things are design flaw as far as I'm concerned. (Like the person in last place goes first in the round and doesnt get a chance to react if someone triggers the end of the round. If they're the one to trigger the end, everyone else gets a chance to react. If the player in first ends the game no one can react). My group is willing to slog through it for a bit to see what is revealed for now. I think at some point we're just going to vote to open the last boxes and look through them just to be free of the game. On the plus side it's probably caused me to care less about legacy games in general.

Everyone in my group is avoiding raiding because of the long-term consequence of doing it. Trader + builder isn't very exciting or new. So everyone scrambles to pick up exploration advisors. And the board clogs up with soldiers.

10-9-2016:
Played the prologue and first game with 3 players.  It took just under 5 hours, but I was engaged almost the whole time.  I think 5 players would have way too much downtime. 
I came in second on tiebreakers 11-11-7 and we opened the first box at the end of the game.  I'm really enjoying it so far and I can't wait for the next game.  

11-1-2016:
We finished game 7 and it was the worst game for me in so many ways.  I am exhausted by so many rules ambiguities, typos, and questions.  I am frustrated by the extreme swings in luck.  I'm at the point where I just want to get it over with.  The only reason I still want to play is just to see what happens, not because the game is good.  The mechanics are clunky, uninteresting, and repetitive.

I hate to give anything Daviau created a 2, because he created Risk Legacy and Pandemic Legacy, which are two of the greatest gaming experiences I've ever had. And there are admittedly good/fun aspects to SeaFall. Still, based on BGG's rating descriptions (where 2 = "Won't play ever again"), it's the most accurate description of our group's reactions. We did play through the entire campaign (I know it doesn't make sense, but it somehow seemed like more of a waste of time--qualitatively, not quantitatively--to quit halfway through the campaign), so the rating does take into account the entire experience.

Points for ambition. Points taken back away for how much grumbling the game made me do and sit through. A few tiny scraps of really cool story elements scattered so far apart in a sea of uninteresting stuff they might as well not exist. Too much downtime, too many mechanics that completely drop out of the game, and way too many ambiguities introduced as the rulebook evolves, including, by the end, HOW TO PROCEED, which is pretty important in a Legacy game. All of which becomes somewhat insulting because the game asks so much time of you. Play Pandemic Legacy again.

This is pretty cool despite all the hate. It's a bit more of a heavy game than the other Legacy games, so keep that in mind. If you don't like luck, then I might not recommend it. It's mostly a dice game, and while there are things you can do to mitigate your luck, it's still a dice game. You can't plan for rolling all hits or all misses with 8 dice. If you, like me, live on the tension of throwing dice, then you have a great game.

Even so, there are definitely strategies you can pursue that don't involve dice at all. It's really interesting in that you can play it like a Euro, or you can play it like an Ameri-trash.

The story feels more epic to me than I expected, and that's a good thing. Kind of like a Civ type game - not only in that it's a 4x, but that you're constantly improving your empire and making it better regardless of whether you win or lose. It's also a fully encompassing world with all kinds of adventures.

My group is a bit disappointed with how much carries over from game to game. You can save to buy upgrades, but the upgrades just go back to the box at the end of a session; I think we're all having fun though.

RATING: 6
Oh, SeaFall. A game that cannot be reduced to just a numerical rating. My current rating reflects the overall experience, and is not to be looked at in a vacuum. And my bias is through the lens of a solo player that has no qualms playing a game like this multihanded (and cutthroat!)
 
Mechanically, SeaFall is very mediocre. The Guild selection mechanic works, but the actions themselves don't feel terribly exciting. Endeavors are billed as the "Ameritrash" element, but are ultimately ho-hum (simply add up your dice pool, subtract dice for various reasons, and roll – the strength of success comes up minimally). Trading is just a bit of boring cube pushing, but provides the coin needed to build and upgrade.
 
Narratively, and creatively, SeaFall CAN be amazing. Or woefully average. The Captain's Booke is quite an achievement of the designers, but many of the stories are redundant or not terribly thrilling. Like its Legacy predecessors, the major motivation is the desire to open boxes, and find new things. And SeaFall sublimely excels there. The desire to find new things, even if those new things are middling, is a powerful driving force. I pushed forward every game to complete milestones and unlock new content. And if that drive doesn’t exist for you, then SeaFall will fail. Unlike Pandemic Legacy, the players have to push this game to completion, and if they become distracted or uninterested in completing the milestones, the game can become a slog.
 
Overall, SeaFall was a positive experience for me. The adventure aspect was the most powerful hook, despite its random rewards. Players looking for a solid Euro style pirate game may succeed elsewhere. However, the player looking for an exploration into the unknown will find a rewarding experience.

Possibly the least pleasant experience I have ever had playing a game. Most games you can play once and walk away from. You do that here and earn the enmity of your friends. Some great stuff in this game but mixed with so much that just doesn't work, is stupidly random, or is just plain unpleasant. Do not play this game without allowing yourself the option of an early out.

The next big "Legacy" game.  Can't wait to hear more about it.  Unfortunately, it requires 3 players.  I'm not sure I can get the same 3 players together for extended gaming sessions...that could kill Seafall for me. :-( 

Pickup and deliver at it's heart...which is thematic, but isn't a huge draw for me.  
Table presence is...lackluster a best.  This will have to ramp up significantly and get some AMAZING hype for me to take the plunge.  So far this sounds like a pass to me...

We have played Risk Legacy and Pandemic Legacy, and I had high hopes for this game.  It did not deliver in the way we had hoped.  We still had a fun time playing through the experience with our group, but felt like the game itself had some flaws, and we would definitely not play it again.

Pros:
-There are some very fun and unique mechanics in the openable boxes.  Our group particularly enjoyed the interrogation mechanic.
-There are catch-up mechanics available if you fall behind.
-The theme and the reading as you explore and unlock things is definitely fun.

Cons:
-Steep rules learning curve, exacerbated by the changes that occur over time.  Rulebook not super well-designed.
-Each individual game takes too long.  I doubt our group played one that was less than 2 hours.
-Some strategies were better for winning than others, since certain strategies didn't get better until boxes were opened.  The catch-up mechanics were not quite enough.
-The game thematically begins as a pirate themed game, heavy with exploration and merchant mechanics.  But some of the story themes don't mesh well with that, and there were 1-2 twists at the very end that seemed like they came out of absolutely nowhere.  

Our group did not do much raiding / antagonistic actions against one another, and by the end of our game, it honestly became kind of a co-operative experience because we all just wanted it to end so badly.

I am a great fan of Legacy game types but was very disappointed with this game. The worst was that it was not fun for all. Some participants were so enormously bored and the pace was too slow and finally we actually gave up (second game ever in my 40 years of gaming I gave up on). We talked a lot about the game and the mechanics afterwards and came to the conclusion that this had the potential to be a really awesome game if it was cooperative!
Unfortunately, the many glitches in the rules and rules that was written beforehand (a little spoiled) also made up for this bad grade. Rob, I know you can do better!

RATING: 7
after 10 games: mid-campaign, 2 boxes (out of 6) left to open

first of all, it is very hard to form and express an opinion on such a game :) 
probably some spoilers ahead

[+] basically, I really like the overall experience, 
and I absolutely want to complete the campaign, 
I like the exploration feel, the discoveries, the evolving and building of this world, 
there are some clever mechanisms (enmity, colonies, advisers, turn order and catch up mechanisms are good)

but

[-]
- the main gameplay is pretty bland (move, do stuff, collect resources or VP, convert resources/gold into VP one way or another)
- the rules piling ontop of one another can slow down the game a lot at times (
- VP gains are very swingy, not only milestones but some explorations can gain you a ton of VP just because you read the right passage in the book; but it seems that the catch up mechanisms work well since the leading player & previous game winner often have a harder time (turn order is very important)
- in terms of story read from the book, I feel it's very bland as well and the outcome of your uninformed choices often feel random
- the way uncharted waters work, most of the stickers end up near the middle of the board because this is where most of our "games" happen, and furter West there won't be any stickers left (the uncharted waters deck is almost reduced to pirates and random boat encounters)

--

after 18 games: finished the campaign and box6 completed.

box 5 => very interesting investigation mechanis (but it should not give VP for that), it takes a lot of preparation to explore/endeavor/reach the milestones, and often the game ends abruptly before every one can "achieve" their goals.
in the end player who managed to open box 6 won the campaign.

box6 => interesting twist but poor implementation with 5 players there are too many bad events between your turns, it often breaks you strategy with no way to avoid it. Fortunately one player had the perfect combo of adviser/relics to end the game once and for all :)

overall the scores have stayed close, the biggest gap was ~25 points between first and last player after game 6.but the catchup mechanism especially turn order worked well, and actually the player who was in last place after game 7 ended up the winner of the campaign, 10 games later. at the end of the campaign, all players were within 16 points (244-237-234-233-228)

Pretty sure no one ever bothered to playtest this game, because the rulebook is awful. About half our playtime is spent googling rules. Additionally, there are just too many weird, awkward, one off rules that no one ever remember. 

Now, rulebook aside, this game is plain unbalanced. Many of the actions are simply not worth ever doing (cough cough raiding ships). Games range from 1-3 hours because you either get no milestones/unlocks for a whole game, or 4 back to back. 

Ultimately, I recommend saving your money and your time and watching some paint dry instead. It's way less frustrating.

Preliminary rating after two games. For now it is heavier and clunkier than expected, but also thematically very intriguing.
UPDATE: almost at the end of the campaign. The problem with this game is that it doesn't give enough guidance to the players with each new ruleset that they unlock. Egregiously the L.o.T. may be probably the coolest game mechanics ever, but the informations it gives just raise a plethora of rules questions that you cannot hope to answer by yourself, and so you just have to wing it in some way.
UPDATE 2: Campaign has ended and rating stays the same. An ambitious game, marred by a lot of rules problems. It could have been a classic, but it falls short.

I am excited. Our group has played the prologue and it made us want more. Can't wait to actually start the first game.

Edit. Now we have played 5 games all together and the game is still interesting. I love how the story evolves. But in our group one player is dominating the game with points. I don't think others can catch him anymore. Still I do want to finish the game. Legacy games are best when a group is playing against the game and not against each other.

Gave up out of boredom after about 6 sessions.  The game just doesn't progress well; the story is drivel, and the underlying game isn't very interesting.

It turns out that you should only add "legacy" to a game that is good to begin with.  Who wants to play a mediocre to poor game 15 times?

Overall, I think that the legacy idea is more appropriate for coops where there can be more focus on the story.

After playing the exciting Pandemic Legacy Season 1, this is unfortunate a dull experience. Pandemic Legacy Season 1 has a really good pacing and tension arc while this game moves along slow and feels very grindy. A shame because the artwork is really good and I like the idea.

We stopped after 6 campaigns.

Rating in progress, but after game two I feel excited to play again.
The game is far from perfect and the rules could have been better written but the campaign feel is excellent and just what I hoped for this far in.

The prologue felt silly and not needed though, a waste of time for me. There is major catch the leader effects in the game, so what if someone misses some rule and get behind in game one (the latter happened anyway in our game one).

Update after game 3 and then again after game 5. It's getting really frustrating with the ambiguous rules and advisor abilities. I really lowers the enjoyment so lowering my rating by 3 (from 9 to 6).
If this was not a campaign game (which I love) I'd rate it a 3 or 4.

3X legacy sea opera campaign to explore, discover islands, colonize, plunder, privateer, and develop trade routes.  This effort has everything.  Ship to ship dice combat, tech trees, story telling adventures, some painful take that, in an unfolding story where player actions uniquely and permanently change sea, commerce, ships and characters. An amalgamation of mechanics. A big game that requires serious gamer time investment.

Based on all the rules confusion, there's no way that I'm ever playing SeaFall.  Rules for legacy games - competitive ones, in particular - need to be nearly perfect, as you only have one chance to get everything right.

It seems they blew it, and not just by a little bit.

Super-hyped for this one.  I hope Rob finds a way to motivate players to focus more on creating a moderately-balanced game.  Regardless, I'm looking forward to the surprises!  :-D

Preliminary rating after Prologue with 5p

Enjoyed 1st game with 3p much more.  Got first unlock and it's a doozy.

2nd game- 3p....  Eek.  I literally botched all but the first and last turn of the game.  Too many variables and too much luck.  ..............  I found myself KIND OF enjoying the experience, but also found this to be the second most frustrating experience I've had playing a quality game (after Game of Thrones 2nd ed).

About 11 or so games in.  Each game is a mess, but some REALLY cool things have been revealed.  It just seems this could have been much better.  It's a trainwreck, but still rolling.

After 11 games.  Dropped this way down.  We finally gave up on this game.  It's got so much cool stuff, but it's honestly just awful.  For two of the three of us, virtually ALL of our bad experiences playing boardgames have been with SeaFall.  It's a fucking trainwreck.  Love Daviau, love Legacy, love a lot of the elements in this game, but jesus, what a mess.  Imagine Ninja Burger, Munchkin, Tzolk'in, and Eclipse had a gangbang with Risk Legacy and Pandemic Legacy and there are rumors somebody was hooking up with Tales of the Arabian Nights....that's SeaFall and not in the good way.  lol

The biggest fear I had going into this campaign was how long all of the game were supposed to last, based on reviews I read. This couldn't be further from the truth. Now, we are only playing with three players, but we've all been hooked from the start. Excited to see where this ends up. 
Future edit: THIS WILL NEVER END. Runaway leader problem.

RATING: 9.5
Currently 15 games in and all ecxept one box opened so far so this rating could change.  With the current trend it is generally  getting better as it goes game.

One unlock has been probably my favorite unlock of any Legacy game so far, but that kind of highlights how the other ones were below expectations.  The not so crazy unlocks makes the game feel like you are progressing slower than you think and then you realize "woah we are only 8 games in and things have changed quite a bit".

Think this has a few things it could improve on to make it an even better game.  High potential of someone getting a huge lead early on that the catch up mechanism so far doesn't seem to quickly deal with.  Math doesn't work out well for incentive to attack your opponents very often making it feel less interactive with the people you are playing with.  I can see how this is likely escalating later in the game to make it more of a blood bath at the end.  Also I am not big on story and theme in games and this is very heavy in it.  I also agree with some other reviews of the poorly written rules.  After you are past that learning curve though it doesn't matter in the long run. Also disappointed by the number of stickers. Ran out of permanent emnity way too early.  We are now a couple of games past when the first person ran out of permanent emnity and we have at least a couple games to go.

That being said, what I think those like myself were excited for in a Legacy game it delivers on.  This does not feel like any other game I have ever played.  You can't decribe it as "It is like this, but with legacy mechanics added in".  It is its own thing.  Its slower feeling start also works well for the target market of this game.  It is a build up and early on it allows for different provinces to get a personality to them before things change.  I hope more unique legacy games like this continue to come out.  Even with knowing the spoilers there has already been talks in our group of buying another copy and playing through it again.  Much better than Pandemic Legacy at keeping your mind engaged between games and excited for the next game after things proceed a few games.

OK. We're past game 10. We give up. Opened box 5. Read everything. Began doing some of the shit it asks us to do. But we all had a collective "who gives a f***" moment. I spent an entire game finally getting a colony. To what end? It seemed a colossal waste of time. The idiot "pirates" show up all the time forcing you to play a specific way. Exploring is sometimes WAY too generous in terms of glory while other things you do that take all game earn you one or two glory. Who thought this was balanced? We've all experienced someone gaining 4, 5, or 6 glory in a single turn and then abruptly ending the game. We all just look at the board and realize everything we did was for nothing!

Did anyone really playtest this thing? I mean, how could ANYONE have believed every player losing every upgrade and building at the end of each game is a "fair" or "good" thing. It's stupid. 

And ship upgrades. Oh my God!, to quote Higgins. You can upgrade ONE freaking thing! ONE! And because of that your ships are always plodding along as barely functional components. It's aggravating beyond all belief.

We stayed away from any indepth reviews. We wanted to have the game grow on us. But it didn't. We all cheered it on at various points but game 10 broke us. It's done. It's just too broken. From the stupid number of advisors to the pirates to the whole treasure hunt, it just doesn't work. 

And each of our games were taking 2.5-3 hours. That's a LOT of time to play. And it's not like we don't play other games. We've been doing this for years. So when it takes 2.5-3 hours per game that's a huge commitment and the game BETTER deliver. And after spending 25+ hours all I can say is it wasn't worth it. 

There is a good game hiding in there. It really needed a non-fawning set of eyes to tear out all of the utter bullshit. To reduce the "Booke" to something simpler, that was easier to digest and not faux-old-English BS. It required a rule book that made sense and actions that didn't require us to go back to the rule book only to not truly discover what it was you were looking for so you headed to BGG and then waded through page upon page of potential rule explanations. 

And some of the subtler bits of stupid, like having the board fold the wrong way so the stickers had to be cut so they wouldn't come off each time we put the game away. Or the way the advisor deck shuffle could result in no one wanting ANY advisor and there being no way to just flush them and get 5 new ones since no one wanted to waste money on the building that let that happen -- why wasn't that a STANDARD building, one where you could drop a coin or two and flush the 5 bastards you didn't want? 

And don't get me started on how if you're simply plodding across the board it could take you 30-45 minutes to get somewhere because you could move 3, maybe 4 spaces if you bought an upgrade. And each game the stuff to explore was further away BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS START BACK AT THE BEGINNING! LIKE SOME EVIL VERSION OF SORRY!!!!

Anyway, this is a 2. I'd never play it again as is. Maybe it can be fixed. But a "SeaFall 2" would just not interest me. To save this requires totally different designers who are willing to rip the thing apart, toss the useless pieces and then stitch together something cohesive and fun.

==============

What an up-and-down experience. Loved the prologue and Game 1. Game 2 ended way too fast. Game 3 took forever and just dragged. 

Our feeling as a group is that the game wasn't play tested properly or by those willing to try different routes to victory. The way that discoveries happen results in some pretty weird board results. And the loss of what you attained or purchased at game end is just stupid. And it's beyond frustrating if you spent some good time and money building up your ship and then the game just ends. And then you lose everything but an advisor. Dumb dumb dumb. And it could easily have been rectified by having the cost of upgrades be higher or having, as an option, the ability to upgrade your ship permanently by paying a higher price and even recording that should your ship ever sink, so you incur an additional cost to bring her back to her former glory during a repair or complete rebuild. 

And the discovery cards should have been divided into stacks for each column. It would have played more logically and divided up things like atolls across the board instead of the possibility of them all aggregating close together. 

As a group we also thought the game should be structured around "winters" not milestones. Thus, as the game progressed a winter would be added depending on how far across the board people have gotten. This would allow everyone to plan better as you'd know when the game would end. Otherwise, a game can just end with you not accomplishing anything and feeling you've just wasted hours of your life.

The story is sweeping. The game will wait for you to move through the story, but you will inevitably progress.

I would have rated this higher had my family been able to play the game without frustration. 

We did 'play' out the remainder of the game and I applaud the designer. A lot of thought and hard work was put into the game. 

This is definitely an empire building game with a lot of strategy.

Nine games in, with five out of the six boxes opened. From reading other reviews, the quest to open the last box is a bit of a slog, but the game has been very fun so far and I expect we'll enjoy the rest of the journey.

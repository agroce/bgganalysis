TABLETOP MINIATURE WARGAME

One of the most enjoyable miniature wargames I've played. Nice miniatures. Tactical. A bit of a dice-fest ... oh, and has a real cool setting.

Faction owned: Empire of the Blazing Sun

I really like this game. The models are superb, and the rules do a good job of integrating air and sea combat.

Despite being steam punk most of the rules play like a WW2 naval game. Main exception to me is the boarding  actions with Rocket marines.  Think War Rocket Ajax in Flash Gordon. I love this aspect of the game.

RATING: 6.5
Great miniatures, but the gamesystem doesn't fullfill the high expectations. Making miniatures is definately another profession than coming up with an innovative gamesystem.

You set up with dozens of ship. Then bang, bang, bang until a couple of ships remains afloat.

* Lucky die rolls.
* Each miniature is moved 2 or 3 times per game in my experience. this is not a game of manoeuvring.
* Too many paste on rules, which you must remember.
* Not a simple game.
* The game could do without boarding rules.

Steampunk naval warfare. Great theme and rather nice models. Felt like a really good game the first few matches but got boring rather fast. Even the most simple attack demands an humongous amount of dice rolls.

Fun game. I thought I'd like a 4 player free-for-all but it takes so long to play even 2 player.

I've rated this a 9, possibly even a 10 with more plays.

Absolutely adore this game, the rules make for a nice balance between complexity and ease of practical use. U love the fact the game covers three spheres of warfare (ground, naval, air) across four altitude levels (submerged, surface, flying, obscured) - and does so with ease.

Every game seems to have moments that are absolutely ringing with story.  The activation system makes for a very strategic game, as do the multitude of options that surround movement, linked fire and other areas.

All in all a wonderful game I want to play more.  Brilliant.

Update:

I was involved in the play-testing of the 2.0 edition of the rules and wow.  In every regard the rules have been improved.  This is an amazing game that is a huge amount of fun to play!

So much so I run a blog and podcast dedicated to the game:  www.element270.wordpress.com

Pretty decent little tabletop naval steampunk minis game. A good sized army is relatively cheap and looks great on the table. The game is pretty easy to play but the rulebook is atrocious.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.8
The minis are super-cool.
Victorian age super-science steampunk vessels - what more could you want?
And the rules strike a good balance between being easy to grasp and having enough crunch to them to make for interesting battles.
The only drawback is that the rulebook isn't written very well and that important stuff is mentioned in places you wouldn't expect it to appear, making looking things up during play a real pain.

My Kingdom of Britannia fleet rules the waves!

This game is an ambitious attempt to create a system for land, sea and air combat in a steampunk setting, and for the most part it succeeds. The rules for small fighter squadrons are possibly its weakest point, as they are far too fiddly for this level of gaming.

Rating after a handfull of plays and only naval based battles.

Models are beautifully detailed; the style will not appeal to everyone but if you like the look of the models the quality is really excellent.

Rules book is also beautifully put together although I wish the index was a little better when trying to locate rules. 

The rules are not complex but are very comprehensive and cover just about every contingency. Maybe I'm just being a bit slow but I also found they required a few read throughs in certain places to get the intention (e.g. I really liked the rules for linked fire (caveat see below) but they could have been much clearer.

The caveat about linked fire being that in historical naval battles of the early 20th century combining fire from different vessels was death to accuracy with multiple shell splashed making ranging almost impossible. Mind you this is very much a distinction between the rules which play well and real-world-physics which they do not mirror (it is a fantasy game anyway)

The 'exploding six' mechanism works well and adds real drama to the game.

I would have given it a higher rating if the minor quibbles above were addressed and there had been a little more thought gone into movement and the ships do tend to drive around a bit like cars rather than large vessels with inertia (I'm not obsessed with physics, really I'm not.

Finally these rules are perfect for house-rules should you be so inclined.

A fun steampunk themed miniature wargame. The models look great and I'm currently collecting two armies: Kingdom of Britania and Empire of the Blazing Sun. The basic rules are pretty straghtforward but it is somewhat fiddly to keep track of all the special model rules. Because of the exploding dice mechanic the dierolls can sometimes get pretty crazy but thats part of the fun. Not for people who like minimal random elements in a game. I like it alot however.

Update:  This game is slipping because Spartan games keeps adding additional game systems and in only providing limited support for its existing line.  The pool of active players is declining because of this.

Dystopian wars in an absolutely first rate naval and air game.  Combat is cinematic and exciting.  The quality of the models in off the charts, and the rules are concise and for the most part simple.  I can not play this game enough.

The game would be a ten.  However, land combat needs more spice.

Absolutely great minis, fun rule set (if you don't mind a [currently first edition] rule book chock full of typos and not very user-friendly).  Good game that is a little tough to teach to new players, especially those unfamiliar with miniatures games.  This from someone who is not a huge fan of fiddly rulers on an open playing area with no spaces (would probably get +1 rating if it was a boardgame, but what can ya do?)

Edit: the new updated rulebook (v1.1) is excellent.  This game is worth a try!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.9
Just an excellent steampunk, naval wargame! 

The models are beautifully cast and with a painted up fleet on a blue board it really is a beauty to play. The rule book could do with re-working (much improved with 1.1 though) and, in my opinion, the rule set could be made tighter. Some, quite rightly, call it a war-game lite - as it doesn't have the water tight rule-set, mission objectives and force construction set of other systems (ie Epic Armageddon, EpicEA etc) but I can see it evolving towards something like that. As always be prepared for lucky dice rolls (exploding 6s mechanic) but that's part of the fun and add a random element into the mix.

After frequent play, games get much quicker as players pick up the rules. It has a very loyal and active fanbase on the Spartan Community page and as such it feels like an evolving game which, for me, adds even more to the appeal. 

Like all wargames, it's really important to have a gaming group that you can actually play against and who are also into the same wargame...not worth the time and money invested if you don't have anyone to play against!

In summary: I really like this game, I play it often against different opponents and would highly recommend it to a wargaming group looking to branch out into other systems...

The only rules I know of that allow you to play air, land, or sea battles or a combination of all 3. The initial cost to play is lower than most other miniatures games especially anything made by GW. Models are very nice. Only drawbacks for some will be the large amount of dice thrown, and some of the rules for tiny fliers are little over-engineered, but overall a very solid game. The rules could use some streamlining and a rewrite. It really comes into its own with combined air-naval battles and nice terrain. Lining up in an open ocean and blasting each other gets old after awhile.

Great game from what I have seen.  Being a BFG fan, this game hooked me pretty fast.  I also went with EotBS because they seem a little bit more over-the-top in terms of steampunk theme...mecha squid and all.  Can't wait to see the Antarctic faction.  Each of the currently available factions has a unique appeal depending on what you are looking for so any steampunk or naval warfare fan should give this game at least a glance.  Check out one of the video tutorials or battle reports.

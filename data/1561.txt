The classic detective game.  Always fun and intriguing.  And IMHO beats regular Clue.  Good edition.

Eh, it's Clue with a few more bits.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.25
This might make it back to the table occasionally since I was finally able to replace some of the weapons missing from my youth.  

For a game of deduction, though, this pales in comparison to Letters from Whitechapel--though it has a much more doable playtime.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Ways it's better than original: more players, more variety, can move further, everyone starts in the same place.
Ways it's worse: Usually makes for a longer game that can drag on, harder to keep cards a secret with the spyglass.
All in all master detective clue is a little better than the original in my opinion.

Okay. The game didn't take nearly as long as the number of permutations of solutions would suggest. The Snoop option was not a factor in the winner's victory.

I played this all the time as a kid.  And with the five years difference in age between my sister and me, I think I beat her a little too often.  And then she refused to play anymore!

Found this at a garage sale for $1.  Sweet components. Box was crushed so I combined this game into my Risk/Castle Risk box. I might have to do that with some more games...

Loved it as a kid, kind of loses its luster to more complex games of today, the plus is it's easy to play and a worthy expansion of the original premise.

A big improvement over standard Clue.  I&#039;m surprised that nobody has pointed out that the way information is asked for and given is very different than in the standard game.  Makes deduction a much more important part of this game.  This is not simply a bigger version of Clue!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's too bad this game has the clue franchise stamped on it, otherwise I think gamers would appreciate it much more.  While I would not play this with more than 2-3 players, there is a heap of strategy for both investigators and the art thief.  Lots of tension.

RATING: 4.5
Master Detective is fundamentally the same game as Clue, but with more possible Suspect/Weapon/Location combinations.  It adds very little to the game, other than making the game take longer to finish.

If you really love Clue you'd probably like this.  But if you're neutral towards the original Clue you'd likely find this a bit of a slog.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Makes Clue bigger, but is that really a good thing? The concept excited me when I first heard of it in high school, but then when I finally got it after college, it was disappointing. Bigger is not always better. Parker Brothers.

It's Clue...but it's bigger; more rooms, suspects and weapons.  Better than the original....but still Clue.  We've had some fun family times with this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is one traditional American style board game that I don't mind playing on occasion. Simple, but short enough to hold your interest with enough skill factor to let the cream rise to the top. I must stress that I would not play this game with the rules as printed in the manual (i.e.: everyone reveals) because it makes the information too easy to come by...just use the original Cluedo rules and it plays fine though.

On the whole, the dice-driven movement still hurts this game just like the original edition, but at least the number of items in play has upped the challenge level from the normal game. There are a number of better deduction style games out there, but for mass-market fare this isn't bad. I would still much prefer breaking out Sackson's Case of the Elusive Assassin though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
This is basically the same game as the original Clue but there are more suspects rooms and weapons. Get it rather than the original if you must but I&#039;d have to ask why. Actually I could see playing this with my Son.

RATING: 8
Perhaps my all-time favorite game, even if only for nostalgia. My original copy was played so much there are almost no empty Detective Sheets, the box completely disintegrated years ago, so it's just a board and a little box with cards and pieces. Superior to standard CLUE, and with Snoop Spaces to help alleviate some roll-&-move frustration. Also, I'm always Sgt. Gray, and we can't play if I'm not. Deal with it.

RATING: 7
More suspects, weapons, and rooms make for a better game if you play by at least one of the old rules: Once a player sees one of the cards he asks for, he stops asking. Also, consider using one die (as in the old game) instead of two dice.

Being a huge clue fan, this game was just awesome as a kid. I mean, how could you go wrong, it was clue but bigger and better! haha...I haven't played it in forever so I'm guessing it probably drags a little esp if you actually play with 8-10 people. I'd probably still like it though.

Adds more rooms, weapons, and suspects to Clue and this is a good thing. It also adds a couple of other rules, some of which are good (rolling two dice for movement), some are mostly harmless (the "snoop" spaces), and one that ruins the game (*all* players show any cards that refute a suggestion).

Fortunately, it's easy to mix and match the rules to your liking.

Marking as previously owned as this was my parents' copy and is still at their house.

I can't remember the last time I've played this game, but I used to play a lot with my parents when I was younger.  It was fun then, and even now, I could see it being quite a bit of fun if playing with family.  For our usual game group, it's a bit too light to play, though I could probably convince them into a game of it.

I like Clue. I've always liked Clue. This version adds additional suspects, rooms and weapons, but keeps the numbers proportionally the same as base Clue. Obviously this make a bigger board and more spaces and a longer game. The box says 2-10 players, but I don't think this really supports party game numbers - too much down time and players start with very little info, which would make the game more of a drawn-out slog. I'd still keep it at 4-5 players max. I thrifted a copy many years ago. It was fun to finally break it out with the kids!

There is one change in that there are spaces that let you look at random card in a player's hand. I think this was added for higher player counts where it might be quite late in the game before you get a sense of what's in the hand of the player to your right. At lower player counts, this space could be ignored.

Finally bought on ebay!  Cluedo is a fantastic game with a two fundamental flaws that (1) finding the room is much more difficult than finding the person and weapon and (2) bad players can spoil the game by unwittingly revealing information to everyone.  By adding more of everything, it all becomes tougher and harder for bad players to mess up.  This is a game of competing 'systems' - is your record-keeping better than your opponents?  There is not nearly as much luck in this game than is often thought and I have no idea why Cluedo is such a maligned game here.  80% of the information you gain is actually found on other player's turns, which means (a) no downtime and (b) your bad dice rolls don't really matter much.

Clue is one of the few "classic" games I like. And this is a nice addition to the family. More suspects, more rooms, and more weapons equals more challenge. The addition of "snoop" spaces I think was a good one. If you land on one you can look at a random card from any other players hand.And if you have a big enough dice roll you can "snoop" and make a traditional suggestion in the same turn. I would probably play this version over the original.

If you read my reviews you know I love mystery games-this is the one that started it all. So much more than regular clue and the magnifying glass spaces help soften the blow of bad dice rolls.

This was a gift for my birthday one year, and I have always enjoyed it.  It's like Clue only bigger!  What's not to like?  

Typically I play with the original Clue "Suggestion" rule, where your turn ends once you get shown a card (as opposed to going all the way around the table).

Colonel Mustard is my character, generally, although M. Brunette is always fun for a slimy Frenchman type.

I like Clue. I have played Clue since I was seven years old. Even as I child though I realized that my enjoyment of Clue put me in the minority. Clue Master Detective is everything I like about Clue turned up to eleven: more suspects, more rooms, and more weapons. I rarely get it on the table and the last time I took it to a game night, they all but laughed me out of the room. I just wish I could play this more often.

Well, this is certainly THE version of Clue to pull out at the family gatherings, as up to 10 people can play!!

More Suspects, more rooms, and more weapons make this a Clue Lover's dream...  However, there are some differences in the way the game is played.

One main difference is that you now go to EVERY other player for a clue (when you have made a suggestion) instead of just asking the player to your left.  This helps to keep the game moving along (considering there are so many more things to find out about now).  Another change is the addition of the "Snoop" space.  These are various spaces on the board that when you land on (or even just pass over them) you can look at a random card from another player's hand.  That also helps to keep the length of the game down...

Whether or not you like these "new" rules is purely up to you...  I, personally, think they work just fine.

So, if you've always loved the game of Clue, and have longed for more... this is it!!

Since this game is basically Clue(do) with more suspects/weapons/rooms to disprove, the game would have taken a bit longer than the basic game - so they changed the rules a little and I think something was lost in the process. Best played with about 4 people with the original Clue(do) rules. Attractive board, weapons and cards.

I haven't played this game since I got Mystery of the Abbey, which I think is much more enjoyable. I will have to try it again.

Clue in general has not been too exciting.  Once you figure out the best way to use info people do/don&#039;t show you, it becomes a game of luck to me.  Master Detective increases the luck factor in that some spots on the board allow you to randomly look at another player&#039;s card.

This is just like clue.  There are more rooms, weapons, and characters, so it's a deeper game requiring more deduction, however it still suffers from the two main flaws of clue.  The roll and move mechanic has no place in the game, and if your pawn "did it", you are at a severe disadvantage toward the endgame as you are yanked from room to room.

I've really enjoyed this one every time we've played--always with at least 7-8. You would think with that many the game would drag, but it seems to move along rather quickly.  However, with that many people and the new revealing rules, you tend to approach a discovery much quicker in a group, so that several people have it figured out at the same time and it is a matter of who goes first.  I do know people that refuse to play with more than 4-5, saying it is too chaotic.  To each his own.

From a gameplay standpoint, I prefer "Clue: Master Detective" over classic "Clue" nearly across the board (although I still enjoy playing my vintage "Clue" games from the 1940s and 1950s, especially for the artwork).  The greater complexity of the game elements (increased characters, rooms & weapons) and rule tweaks (including changes to the "suggestion" process and making the use of two dice official) result in a longer, but more enjoyable, game with less roll-and-move monotony.

Along with the new characters and rooms come a few changes to the rules.  Snoop Spaces allow you to secretly peek at the card of another player, and when calling a "suggestion," everyone who holds a card must show it to you.  This definitely helps to keep the game moving since it could easily be bogged down by so many players. However, the high player count makes it harder to deduce who has different cards and combined with the rule changes, I felt the game was a bit less interesting than the original.

With the inclusion of more of everything, this is much better than standard Clue.

I loved this game as a kid, so I probably like it more than it actually warrants.

Clue with more stuff -- 12 rooms, 10 suspects, and 8 weapons. I use the main Clue entry to track this one, since it is practically the same game.

I remember playing this in college.  There were like 4 of us who took Clue WAY too seriously when we played and took meticulous notes.  One of them had his parents bring this to campus when they came for a visit and I remember really enjoying this variant, with the extra areas to explore and the extra clues.

This game is really fun. Much better than the original Clue.

Complete, with most of the detective's pad still available - the pieces and cards are excellent.  There is some dishing on the insert and on the outer box, but only slight wear.

The ability to look at specific cards without other players knowing what you're seeing adds a vaguely more interesting dimension than vanilla Clue.  Which wasn't a terrible game, just not a great one.

Simply  larger version of the original clue.  It is fine for children with longer attention spans

I've heard some say this game is solved.  That you can deduce the answer way ahead by keeping the right notes.  But I always play to confuse, frequently guessing cards that are in my hand, to throw others off.

Fun family game, very simple yet immersive. Played this a lot and combined with other games as well.

Clue is one of the 'classic' board games that I still enjoy, even if I'm not very good at it.

This is the version that my parents have, I haven't played the original in so long that I'm not even sure how it differs.

One of the most amazing (and funny) games I have ever played--this was a gateway game from Milton-Bradley to 'boutique' gaming for me. Fnord!

RATING: 6
Great cards and interesting concept brought down by an overly fiddly and annoying money mechanic. 

Definitely worth a few plays but games can become tedious when you have to generate lots of income for many groups especially as the counters are small.

RATING: 9
A rating based more on my desire to play than a reflection of state-of-the-art game design, this is one of the games that brought me to the hobby, and still makes me laugh (and occasionally weep from the backstab wounds). For a 1983 design, what once was excitingly original has become pleasingly familiar!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
The rules of this game seem specifically designed to infuriate and prolong the game itself.  When one player gets close to winning, all the other players can all simply attack and entirely demolish that player's illuminati.  

As the strength of the point that is being attacked is weakened by every attack, successive attacks by multiple players are almost guaranteed to bring down the player in the lead.

When attacking to neutralise it becomes easier to attack, and following a successful neutralise attack the game goes backwards, returning the tree to the supply and requiring it to be reacquired just to count.

Buen juego, quizá algo largo y con bastante propensión al puteo y a la puñalada trapera. No es sencillo de explicar, pero tampoco es complicado.
Lo veo largo para lo que es, y es imprescindible jugarlo con gente no muy competitiva, porque el juego va de eso, de colaborar unos con otros hasta que sólo queda uno.
Creo que es un juego que puede encajar muy bien en algunos grupos, y sobrar en otros. Si dudas pruébalo, puede que te sorprenda.

Took me awhile to wrap my head around the flow of this game. It's alright but not really my thing. Half the fun seems to be connecting the silly organization names to the theme and getting into the feel of your base organization and its nefarious goals. The heavy luck factor and quirky decision trees keeps me from caring to play it much.

Havn't played it in years, but doesn't mean I wouldn't. My favourite was the Space Aliens, as you could choose your objective. I was quite happy to let people pay me to find out what my  objective was, but if they didn't, I'd sneak out into the kitchen and burn the slip of paper. It really used to hack them off. Serve 'em right, tight fisted gits!

Great game for hardcore gamers. I don't recommend it for more normal folks. Like Risk, you can lose badly and quickly get eliminated from a game that could go on for a while. As the Germans would say: Schade. On the other hand it allows for great meta-gaming experiences, as well as backstabbing, lying and a whole host of other nasty things that you can only feel good about in a game.

RATING: 6
Illuminati is a fun game but it will quickly fall in the cathegory of games where you only after a few rounds can determine who will come out the strongest. It has great humor and interesting concept but after having played it a number of times it loses some of it's appeal. 

Strategy wise it is interesting but the original game will seem to finish quicker and quicker the more times you play. The downside with these types of games is probably that the theme in itself has bigger appeal then the way they are played in the end.

it's still a good and fun game I wouldn't turn down to play.

RATING: 6.5

RATING: 3
This game always plays the same way: First, everyone gets into the spirit, and thinks it will be fun.  Next, the game devolves into a stop the person in the lead game.  Finally, someone gets bitter, then we quit, never finish the game, and vow to never play it again.  I think I will take our advice, and never play it again.  Maybe it was reflective of a certain time period in gaming history where this was the best there was, but compared to what there is out there now, this is just junk.  I would rather play Giganten than this smelly poo of a game.  Great theme, and funny cards.

Much too prone to analysis-paralysis.  This game just feels like a bunch of computations all to compare to one die-roll.  The rules seem very convoluted.  This is definitely not my type of game.  With the attacks and counter-attacks combined with the AP it can take hours to play, and this game doesn't have hours of fun in it.

This is the 1983 version and includes expansion number 1. The original case is gone (thus the rating) - the cards, rules and tokens are intact and in good - excellent condition. I have made a nice box to store it in - so the game is not just loose. Box includes cover art.

A true diamond in the rough.  Sure the components are low budget.  Sure the illustrations are amateur.  Sure you have to cut the stamp sized Megabucks yourself.  But SJ created a fun game of screw your friends over.  Lots of inside jokes and parodies in the card choices.  I got this one from a comic book store in my youth, and of course picked up the expansions.  Never a bad game played.  The only real negatives, are that the game can drag on sometimes and sometimes, you can be eliminated early and have to sit out (keep an Atari or C-64 handy).

Have the original and expansions 1,2,3.  Played regularly in high school (same group as Nuclear War, i.e. Nuke War).

Homemade card for our Fencing club: conservative, violent, and weird.

From years of gaming, Illuminati, in the totality of it's releases and variants, is the only game I have returned to. Can't get better subject matter or mechanics. It all but forces reflection on, and conversation about, modern "western" society. Should be far more popular than it is. The original 1987 deluxe edition could seriously stand a reprint (with the original art, which makes it far more accessible than the much more aggressive and less playful later Deluxe, Bavarian Fire Drill, Y2K, Mutually Assured Distraction and INWO.)

I finally tracked a used copy down and am introducing it to my current circle along with other "worth it" games (which I consider to be less than 3 dozen in the entire universe of board games.)

Bears the unmistakable scent of dung.  It's hard to rate it so horribly, mainly because back when I was too young to know better I thought it was pretty cool- mostly owning to a weird obsession with secret societies I went through when I was 12.  Basically the game boils down to rolling for target numbers while folks spend money to increase or decrease the number and there's all this crazy metagaming that's supposed to happen like cheating and backstabbing.  Usually, it's just people getting bored really quickly with the hopelessly uninteresting gameplay and tired attempts at lampooning conspiracy theory.  That a piece of rubbish like this is still in demand and in print while games like Dune and Kremlin are long gone is really indicative of what poor taste most gamers seem to have.

I enjoyed this one as it has a decent theme and we also spent a lot of time 'negotiating' over the use of money to pull back the leader at each point in time. So it was my kind of game. 

It was very long, which I think was because we were playing a 5 player and our group is prone to AP. More plays with less people could see this one become more enjoyable, however the game wasn't so good that I can see it getting much more table time.

Fun card game, with money, strategy, and diplomacy thrown in.  It doesn't play like your typical card game though. Enough there to keep things interesting.  Never get in the lead though.  The object is to get the player to your right in first place.  When he goes for the win, let others use their resources to sabotage his effort...then you can waltz in.  :)

Idea:
- Each round play action to get control of new group / destroy one. Each player has secret starting illuminati that is revealed if someone as action quess it right. After that its harder to score object as others know what you try to reach. Each controlled group gives more money and money is power!

To whom
Pretty simple card based game with some luck aspect to those who like the theme or want casual game with friends. More complicated version as CCG Illuminati: New World Order

I've actually had my copy of this game since about when it came back (yes, back in 1982, though it was probably closer to 1986 when I got mine). I never played it back then; had it all this time and I actually pulled it out to play for the first time a couple months back. Not bad.

RATING: 4
Old school, lengthy... tedious.  Back in the day the mechanics could have been called "elegant" but as with many old school games you have one slightly interesting mechanic that just gets churned over and over again until someone stumbles across the finish line to win... bleh.

IMHO too high a proportion of the time is spent going around the table getting people to kick in the Meagabucks to block a takeover, even when strict time limits are used for this apsect of the game.

RATING: 5
The only reason this doesn't rate higher is because it can drag on and on. Too many times we reached a point of equilibrium where nobody could advance and nobody was especially vulnerable, until sheer fatigue drove a player to recklessness. Fantastic game, but it can be an endurance contest.

RATING: 8
This game has novel mechanics, interesting cards, and fun game play.  It is unique and I have really never encountered a similar game.  I like choosing one sect of illuminati with their special powers.  It is good with two, better with three, and great with four or more.  Everyone should have at least one Illuminati set in their collection.

Played recently for the first time in over 20 years.  It has a lot of good ideas and the social satire holds up remarkably well today.  The game mechanics could use a refresh though - the  dispersal of the money chits is monstrous and the rulebook is astonishingly long for such a relatively simple core idea.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
As important as this game was to '80s-'90s geek culture ("fnord," etc.), it is no damn fun.  It's pointless with less than 4 players, and with the proper number of players it's an endless exercise in number-crunching and analysis paralysis.

The last time I played was with 6 close friends several years ago and it turned into an embarassing, awkward series of hissy fits.

Even though it's on my "own" list, I think I might have actually thrown it in the trash.

Apart from its backstabby, rules lawyering ways, this game is fun just in the graphic construction of your power structure, along with the conceits like girl scout cookies really being a front for south american nazi refugees, or however the cards get played.
I think this game is cool, but some people get turned off by a description of the Illumanti game experience the way some do after hearing how Diplomacy works.  that is, this is a game which explores direct rivalry through in-game attacks, and either emotional maturity or detachment is needed to play a game and enjoy it.

It's really a love it or hate it sort of game, but if you've got friends who are into the cheerful backstabbing and absurd conspiracy humor of Illuminati, it's one of the best games ever.  A bit long, perhaps, and definitely not to be played by someone who's going to take it too seriously or at all personally, but, boy, do I ever love it.  I often just grab the old pocket box edition rather than tote around the new Deluxe Edition, but either version is a hoot and a half.

An interesting game which is a lot of fun with the right people. Unfortunately, my local gaming group is the wrong people as it is a foregone conclusion that the cheating rule will be invoked and the winner is the best cheater and not the person who played his cards most effectively. Fits the theme but ruins the game. Also the usual crap SJG production values and the cards would have been better done as square tiles.

Can seesaw too much for me.  When you get behind it's a little too hard to catch up, especially if two or more players are solid together.

Another fave from the 80s.  The paranoia conspiracy theme is absolutely the best part of the game.  It's hilarious to watch the Mafia gain control of the Boy Sprouts with the help of the Clone Arrangers, or similar unlikely power plays.  The game doesn't work very well, though. The group control mechanic is just too, well, mechanical.  Everyone usually waits until they have the maximum chance to succeed before attacking because it's just too costly to waste an attack. The safest course is to accumulate neutral groups until the end when someone is threatenting to win.  Never tried the CCG version, although I hear it's better.

It was a tense moment, but the lie worked.  I never bother playing this again.

RATING: 6
This is the most confusing/convoluted game ever. But it was fun.  You're basically trying to become a hidden power by influencing typical world entities. It's really fun until players like me start getting messy and start stealing things (which is totally legal). The other issue is the game tends to go on forever, as people try to build their networks, players are allowed to steal networks from each other or the pot and then the game gets distracting as you all slowly descend into being a scumbag. 

It's fun for a bit, but I am in no rush to play another round.

RATING: 2
At first glance, I thought Illuminati would be a very fun game: interesting and hilarious theme, a lot of interaction and negotiation, a bit of screw your neighbour and backstabbing and some dice. I expected the game to drag a bit and being quite luck driven, but I thought the rest of it's qualities would make me overlook that.

Sadly, the game behaves like every other Steve Jackson's game: it's a game in which you collect cards until you are overpowered and are bashed by the other players in some stupid way. This continues during the whole game until someone is about to win and the rest of the players can't do anything to stop him because they have spent all their resources in all the previous "about to win" situations.

To make things worse, it's terribly unbalanced: some of the secret societies have either a shitty or an extremely awesome ability along with a special victory condition, which can be somewhere in between "easy" and "try if you dare". It's important to mention that the victory condition that's available to all the players is close to "impossible to achieve".

Last but not least, the dice mechanism: it ends up in declaring an attack, start spending money to add bonuses or penalties to it (depending if you are attacking or defending) and roll to see if you are lucky. The problem with this is that it's the chore mechanism of the game, so you'll be doing that 95% of the time during two or three hours, which is utterly boring.

Overall, a game that would have been fun if it lasted 30 minutes, which only happens when you are two or three, but the game is thought for four or more players, so... An interesting idea that fails miserably in its implementation. May be persuaded to play again, but won't suggest it. Never.

I played this a quite many times when I was younger. Hidden objectives were interesting (and unique (for me)) idea and it was fun to play it. Later on, I realized, that the game took too much time and all the games were same kind of experiences.

A fun game of plots within plots.  Unfortunately, the center of the game is not power, but money and special cards.  Strategy amounts to holding on to as much cash and cards as possible while convincing other players to spend theirs.  On the other hand, the game and its theme are silly enough that I can enjoy it, if just for seeing the Goldfish Fanciers become Cthulu cultists.

A friend sold me this and the first two expansions a VERY long time ago, and I've only played it about twice since, but I have a great sentimental fondness for it.  In reality, I should rate it higher since I would play it at the drop of a hat given the chance, but I know I wouldn't enjoy it as much as other games I've played recently, so 6 it is.

A bit too long. When it seem's somebody is about to win, everybody focuses on him and you've got to almost start over again and again. This reminds me the game Dead End.

Demasiado largo. Se hace pesado a mitad de partida, pues cada vez que alguien se destaca, le llueven palos por todas partes y se vuelve a una situación inicial de nuevo. Me recuerda al Dead End en este sentido.

I enjoyed the GURPS books, the Robert Anton Wilson trilogy, and, at the time I played INWO, I was really into CCGs -- but this was a pretty average CCG.

I really like this game. We never really played it right (in the wheeling and dealing and back stabbery way it's meant to be played), we were too "polite". Nevertheless, I love the theme and I love the humour (Feminists are controlling the Girlie Magazines - again, what is it with those guys?). Components are a little dicey in the version I have - just one sneeze and everybody's money is all over the place, a really candidate for poker chips as replacement money, it would even feel right with the theme (but wouldn't fit on the cards)

When the game first came out, it was  OK (I would rate it a 5), but it got boring and the playing time was too long for my taste (and I'm a grognard wargamer). This is the second lowest rating that I have given to a game that I played. Only Cards against Humanity rates lower. This game is not in my collection; never was, never will be.

Ok I heard playing this with the expansion is good but....
Pros: lots of cards with amusing art and opinions
Cons: well as with most SJ games overrpiced, who's bright idea was it to use money *TOKENS* these things bog the game down. Since everyone has different objectives, its really easy to forget someone's about to win. Nothing really seems to happen in this game...It's sort of like, once you've captured a group they're importance/story is moot. Might play again...thank god I didn't buy it :)

I thought maybe this was a game that actually didn't suffer from the Steve Jackson Cheap Components Curse, but then I went and looked at it again.  The cards are good, but the money is flimsy and small.  Still, the gameplay is great, and the theme is a hoot.  One of the first places I encountered Cthulhu in the wild (not to mention the Discordians).

The first non mainstream game I ever played many years ago.  I was introduced to it by a non gamer friend who had played it with one of his gamer friends, the rest was history.  Nothing says buddy f***er like a Steve Jackson game, and that's exactly what this is.  The variants included in the rules help to keep things interesting and there are even rules for cheating, not as punishment but how to implement it!  Always fun, but recommended for a group of good friends.

I once loved this game, but I've lost interest in it over the years.  It's too long, and too many games are won with priveleged attacks.  Players who luckily draw action cards on their turn get a huge advantage.  Too much accounting; too much turtling down; attacking other players is not rewarding enough; and the Gnomes are much too powerful -- they either get constantly beat upon by the other players, or they win.  

Still, it can occasionally be fun with people who don't take it too seriously, and any game where the Congressional Wives can end up controlling the Robot Sea Monsters gets a few extra points in my book.

This rating for the base game.
Good with the right players. I have the "modern" reprint which is compatible with INWO. The basic game is repetitive, and can take too long. However, with seeded cards from INWO there is enough variability to make it interesting.
The problem is keeping the base draw-deck balanced while varying the additional cards- there needs to be lots of preparation.
The cards themselves are great - fantastic art and some very good jokes. I used a scan of /The Weird Turn Pro/ as my desktop background for ages.

Not much fun as a 2-player game. Can be a lot of fun with the right group and I recommend no more than 4 players. The idea that you can cheat until you are caught lowers this one to a 6 in my game rating book. Everyone should play fair. The math involved can be tedious enough without trying to catch someone cheating at it. I understand the NEW deluxe version has very colorful and humorous art work as compared to my old black and white deluxe version. Assuming "no cheating allowed", I rate this "card game" an 8.

I played the hell out of this one back in the 80's, I would likely have rated it an 8 back then. I'd like to give a revisit but I really have far too much interesting stuff I'd like to play first.  Looking back I can recall how much I really hated the way all those megabucks would blow around if you had the temerity to exhale too close to them.

I can see how this game would have been great back in the day, but it is now so outdated by newer games.  The 2 that most come to mind are Discworld, for a much faster version of competing of asymetric win conditions, and Nothing Personal, for having pretty open-ended ways for players to spend money to block you on your turn.  Combine wasting time with arithmetic to calculate all the modifiers before you attempt an attack with so much randomness - the randomness of the rolls (huge amounts of money spent back and forth, only to then roll an 11 or 12) and the fact that actual amount of money on cards is hidden (players can see how many tokens are there, but only the top token's value, so you should just hog all the 1's and 2's to make it very hard to estimate) - and you just have a mess on top of some interesting dynamics that have been refined by modern games.  Don't waste your time!

Deluxe Edition from the 80s
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Illuminati Deluxe, Finnish version (published by FGH). Slow to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
One of those games we used to play a lot. I love the theme, having read the classic Illuminati books by Robert Anton Wilson.

I am proud to say the copies I own of this game and Expansions 1 & 2 were the prize I got for winning the Illuminati tournament at GenCon 1984. Possibly this was the greatest achievement of my life. :-)

Also, I ran a play-by-mail version of this game in 1991 that was a lot of fun. You don't want to know who was really behind Desert Storm...

RATING: 7
With the right group this is a good game. With players who find no humour in the cards it's a complete dud! It needs a second playing soon after the first so the arithmetic becomes second nature and players can concentrate on the fun in the game. It's all about player interaction and getting into the feel of the game. I find this basic game better than the deluxe version because there are fewer cards. That means sooner or later cards necessary to win will come up. The Deluxe edition can stretch the game out too long.

Very cool theme, especially when lots of organizations are on the table, your control structure looks like someone's conspiracy theory rant (Comic Books Companies control the FBI, which is just a front for the Water Flouride People!) Suffers from 2 hour plus playtime, unclear goals, slow cash-moving mechanics, obvious faction imbalance. Causes headaches.

Any game with sanctioned cheating is ok in my book. Gameplay is zany, devious, silly, and sneaky. Pass me the megabucks! In all fairness I haven't played this in a while. Is this game underrated, just because it's from Steve Jackson Games? Or is it just as people say, and after digging out this old timer I'll find myself lining up with the crowd? We'll see.

Fun becuase its funny when The Vatican, the Mafia and the IRS are all controlled by OPEC.  Has serious end-game issues.  Also has rules for cheating.  Those with a perpensity to be kingmakers, or those with real situational awareness deficiencies:  stay away from this game.  BTW, nobody with an ounce of sanity plays this game with open money holdings.  Just say &quot;NO!&quot;

This game was my introduction to modern board games, so it holds a special place in my collection.  Aside from that, though, it really is just fun!  It's devious and deep with a fun theme.

I love this game, but it takes a long time to play by today's standards, and though it's meant to be a more offensive-defensive strategy game, it ends up being more of a race to complete the victory conditions, because it becomes hard to keep track of where everyone is with their victory conditions.

Illuminati is a really fun, clever game that has never managed to evolve past its early 80's roots. The game can be very long (several hours), especially with more than 3-4 players. It's "smackdown the leader" gameplay will almost always outwear its welcome, and some of the expansions have tilted the balance of the main deck in strange ways. Still, it's core is solid -- just know what you're getting into.

A solid game system, with very nice theming, whose flawed victory conditions almost always ends up with two players making a deal to win together, rendering the actual play of the game mostly irrelevant.  Sigh.

If a tied victory required, say, 50% more groups among the combined total, this game would be a lot better.

This game has been around for a while, but I only recently played it for the first time.  We were under a time limit, so we reduced the requirements for victory. I'm not sure if we got a complete feel for the game. It has an interesting bit of positional play, but it does seem like it could be a pretty long game for a take that card game. I am not sure about my opinion and wouldn't be willing to rate the game based on that experimental play.

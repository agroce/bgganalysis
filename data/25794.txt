RATING: 7
A bit of a dice fest (as you might expect) but very fun.  The models are amazing, very detailed and some even have articulated parts.  Only complaint is that the game is a bit slanted towards the battleships.

Good as a game but air combat part slows the game up.
Pre-painted stuff ,good to buy just for the ship models.

Rules are light and easy to understand leading to quick fun dicefest gaming.  Collectable minis are nicely painted and fun to play the game with.  Maps seem a bit small though for navel warfare.  Air support plays well also..

Bought a starter and £50 worth of singles from the base set to see how it goes. I`ll let you know. 

UPDATE: This is very good. Expandable, simple, great model ships. Good game. Not too expensive considering it is a collectable game.

Once again, great minis, especially on their flat tops and battleships. Scale wise is bad again.

Game system is similar to the land version.

Game map is bad and ugly. Squares/Rectangles, that don't fit the ships at all. Too big a mini on too small a map. You can actually set up a blockade line.... on a WW2 game?

Saved the minis for display. Never played the game again.

One day while cruising around the Geek I stumbled across some pics of the Axis & Allies Minis War at Sea game. WWII Pacific theater has always been a favorite game theme for me and my dad enjoys it as well. When I was a kid we had AH's Midway and Victory in the Pacific and both really enjoyed them. So rather than my negative knee jerk 'it's a minis game :(' reaction and collectible at that, I actually took some time to look into the game. It's a fairly simple system, not a lot of rules, plays fairly quickly depending on the size of the battle you want, movement is simplified, combat is not much more difficult than Memoir '44. The system didn't have a lot of pieces to collect, the entire set was only 64 ships and planes meaning it'd be relatively inexpensive compared to other collectible games and easy to store. (Note: there are now 5 sets available and the newer sets only have 40 pieces per set.) I decided to try it out and found it to be just what I was looking for.

The minis are very well detailed and come pre-painted. The scale is 1:1800 for ships and 1:900 for planes. The largest minis are about 6" long and the smallest come in at about 1". Most are in the 3" to 4" range. The cost for the larger capital ships is maybe a little cheaper than what you'd find if you purchased metal minis with comparable detail but none of the metal minis come pre-painted. The smaller destroyers and cruisers you can get online for $0.50 to $1.00 so they are easily cheaper than anything comparable in metal. These minis are useable with miniature rules systems like Victory at Sea from Mongoose and others of course. 

There are now 6 sets of minis that have been released for the game (as of Feb. 2012) and the game has a strong following. The first two sets of minis have gone OOP however and many of those pieces will be hard to find. A 2nd starter set was released in 2010 that added updated rules and a fixed set of minis (5 per side) unlike the random starter set that was originally released for the game.

The game has come a long way since the original set. Many new concepts have been introduced along the way, like night rules and ships and planes with special actions that take advantage of that. The 6th set is slated to introduce minesweepers to help counter the minelayers introduced in previous sets. There are also shore batteries as well with one unit based on Fort Drum.

Look for nice counters and markers here:

Litko also has nice plastic counters besides their A&A naval set. I use several of their blast counters to track hits instead of the numbered counters. You can also use their custom counter sets to add more counters of just the type you need.

Here are some comparison photos showing Litko counters and the original:

Nice playing mats are available here:

4" hexes or squares work nicely for this scale of miniature.

And here is an excellent forum/trade site dealing with A&A minis that I'd highly recommend:

Finally, I use this entry as a placeholder for all of the set releases rather than list them all as being owned since I do own something from every set released.

Deeper gameplay than Star Wars Starship Battles. Lots of dice rolling (happiness!). The randomization has bit me in the butt so far, and I'm extremely reluctant to purchase more. Bummer.

Nice moneysucker game.
I think i spend more than 1.5k $ trying to collect playable fleets in 2012-2015.
Well balanced game, especially if you have huge collection.
Capital ships, like carriers, looks awesome, destroyers and u-boats - are not pretty much, but it`s ok. Most aircraft looks good.
Nowadays is very hard to get normal and playable collection, especially outside westworld.

Recommended only for crazy fanatics of this game. Like me.

RATING: 5
Seductive, collectable cash-cow. Neither depth going nor innovative. I can't deny it's quite a pleasant game for a couple of game sessions, but consider it more as a Yahtzee at sea. To me it doesn't feel like a naval game at all.

Some ships look very nice. However the gamesystem has serious flaws, such as enemy submarines you can't destroy because you run out of antisub capability. And since you cannot leave the mapboard and surface ships are faster than submarines the endgame can be very long.

Great game!  This was one of my favorite games before it was replaced by the "Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures" game.  Much like X-Wing, this game and MANY expansions could fit entirely within a single small tackle box, which is great when compared with my Warhammer 40K space marine army which is two large boxes and a bag with rules/dice/tape measure....and that's for only ONE army (one-half the game).  This is a great game if you want to play an X-Wing style game with someone who might not be into Star Wars (I play this game with my dad who is very much into old warships).  The combat is simplistic, but I love the ships that are named instead of being generic (i.e. "USS Tennessee" instead of "Battleship Type XXXX") and each card has a short history of that ship and will sometimes include special rules that fit with that history.

somewhat disappointed
the scale is not clear to me, it seems to be 4000 yards per  area but only 2 ships instead of 4 are allowed in an area. probability of a torpedo hitting a battleship and destroyer are the same. there is no provision for the facing of warships which is a significant part of the Naval strategy.

RATING: N/A
System clearly derived from A&A Miniatures.  Some good things were done in ship weapons assessment--particularly in the realm of secondary/tertiary guns--but on the other hand, some truly bizarre things were done with torpedoes, which, contrary to the game's presentation, were not regularly reloaded from a torpedo magazine but, with the exception of submarines, Japanese surface combatants and a few old battleships, were single-shot one-torpedo-per-tube-per-mount weapons.  Equally strange is the total absence of facing: all ships have all-round gunnery capability.  No crossing the "T" or reducing firepower while trying to close (Admiral Holland would have wished it were so).  Most of the minis are pleasant to look at.  Fletcher class destroyers are so undervalued, it's almost a war(game) crime.

Played it a few times and didn't care for it.  Has a vague naval feel to things, but subs & BB's seem to dominate the game.  As a caveat, we played with the Brits and Germans, and my Swordfish got batted out of the air by German AA fire very easily.

Excellent gameplay. Miniatures are great to scale models but the paint jobs are a little light. I am impressed with the historical accuracy of the game and highly recommend it. I love the "taking damage after you've had a chance to shoot" rule. It makes for less meandering trying to get the first shot which most miniature games suffer from.

Enjoybale, fast-playing, and well-balanced light WWII Naval Miniatures game. Models are actually pretty nice, overall. They'll stand up to abuse from kids and pets, have turrets that swivel, and the paint jobs aren't great but aren't terrible, either. The sculpts themselves are pretty broad (though true, so far as I could tell) and the plastic a bit too bendy, so hard-core miniaturists will find them objectionable. If you enjoy the A&A:WWII Minatures game, add a point or two to this rating. If you are a hard-core WWII Naval Miniatures player, drop a point or two. Too bad this is a collectible minis game.

I would say that this is the best simulation Naval miniature ever made.  High specific painted miniature details on both sides Axis and Allies makes you possible to combine any miniature you have to the battle field. To build a fleet you have to select each items based on maximum points allowed, so it will make the game more balance on both sides. Off course if you're playing Allies you will have better choices then Axis in order to determine your fleet.

Sure it's a CMG, get over that. Pick a fleet of single miniatures, order them online and then get down to having some epic battles on the table top. You won't have to memorize complex rules, build, or paint a thing. 

I like, in particular, the aircraft rules, as planes can be a big part of the action in the Pacific during WWII.

awesome game!  Quick play, easy to learn rules, pre-painted minis, space saving unit stat cards the size of your standard playing card. 
Cards fit into 9-page protectors for safe storage.
Cards fit into single card protectors if you wish to store them in a box or other means.

I build up a fleet then put the cards I am using in a 9 page protector to keep them organized during play.  It also facilitates record keeping on the clear plastic using a vis-a-vis water based marker.

Kind of a toss-up for me. I like the minis and the simplicity of the games, I think the aircraft blend into the game play well. Otherwise, not so happy about the collectible aspect of it and the battleships are too powerful. Moved on to Panzerschiffe miniatures after.

  Excellent light war-game.  I would recommend using proxy miniatures for some of the harder to acquire ships.  The rules are very balanced and make a good deal of sense.  While I'm not a fan of the collectible aspect my friends large collection on miniature ships makes this a very good game indeed.

RATING: 7
I love the miniatures.  Hardly ever play by the normal setup rules. The mechanics are decent enough for recreating historic battles. I tend to use Rich Baker's house rule for resolving torpedoes on the next turn.  I have 2 problems with this game.  The first is that the AA values of the 1939-1941 ships are way to high to reflect what they actually mounted. Most of the US and IJN ships in the game saw the most n notable action in 1943. The values are fine for that, but really skew the accuracy of 1941 "what of" scenarios.  The other issue is that battleships are just too darn hard to damage with aerial bombs.  Most battleships has desk armor protection on par with aircraft carriers and that dynamic really needed to be addressed.

The minis for the capital ships are really nice. However, the minis for ships like destroyers and submarines are often pretty crappy. The game is not bad either. It is certainly not the deepest wargame out there, but it was fun to play and played fairly fast. It has a bucket 'o dice combat system and I just love chucking dice, so that is a plus.

Even if the game system does not appeal to you the minis could be used in other games.

Haven't played it yet, and sadly I most likely never will. Such is the case with most of my miniatures games.  I didn't go crazy picking these up-- perhaps someday I'll do a few surgical strikes on eBay to get enough ships for a couple of decent fleets, but no more boosters for me.

I just splurged $200 (part of my work bonus) on 2 starters and 10 boosters! I got a pretty good draw, with strong IJN and USN forces, and respectable RN, Kriegsmarine contingents, an OK Italian force, and only one French ship, which suits me fine, as the French navy did not exactly have an active and significant role in WW2! I am now buying some select additional units off of eBay to round out my forces. I haven't played yet, but the minis are outstandings, the rules seem very clean, and this looks like a lot of fun. The only negative is of course the flimsy maps - I will be using plexiglass over them, so the issue is minimized. All in all, this looks like a real winner - I'll rate it after I get a few games under my belt. 

Two games played - This is GREAT! Real decisions have to be made at every turn, from which units to select at the beginning, to which moves and attacks to make during the game.

Slightly flawed in regards to historical accuracy and believable game play (fighters can sink destroyers), but a very fun game. The units have enough in regards to special abilities to make it interesting, and you really DO feel like you are in command of a naval battle. It's lite enough to show to non-gamers who love WWII (i.e. my brother in law) but deep enough to keep you coming back. I enjoy this one immensely, but YMMV.

RATING: 7
Simple enough to be really accessible for many different types of gamers.  Problem becomes that of any collectible game: X-amount of the units will be immediately left out because other units are obviously more cost-effective.  And I'll let you guess what rarity the best ships tended to be.  Still a fun entry-level sea battle game.

I’m fond of wargames and minis so WaS can’t be in my favourite games list. The mechanic
in my opinion is too much dice oriented, luck plays a major part in every engagement. I like it because it’s fast and very scenographic… 
My 500pt Kriegsmarine fleet deployed on my tabletop it’s a quite terrific look.

Wonderfully detailed pre-painted naval miniatures.  The rules to the game as written are pretty basic, but the beauty here is that you can use the miniatures with other rule sets which makes them pretty versatile.  The big downside, of course, is the "collectible" distribution model.  This makes it pretty darn expensive to collect the complete sets, especially the first two sets now that they are long out of print.

Wildly inaccurate and hurt by the collectible aspect because you can't buy something like a strictly Japanese booster pack. This is of course a ploy to separate me from my money, but one that I find distasteful because this game can be very expensive. However, the game is also quite fun and more importantly it offers you a great and diverse line of miniatures. The rules are few so they lend themselves well to customization and thus improvement. On that note I suggest an experienced player use Owll's rules or mine: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/53099/seans-rules-for-aawas.

RATING: 7
War at Sea is an easy-to-learn, fast-paced game and has nice-looking minis. Game mechanics work well for the game style. To gain any variety or to realize the full potential, however, this game will cost lots of money. For example, I origianlly bought the basic set and 2 boosters and got lots of Japanese ships with axis bombers and allied fighters. Thus, I was limited to playing the axis without fighters. Then, I picked up 4 more boosters and got one axis fighter but no carriers.  Thus, I am limited to playing axis with one fighter and without carrier support. You get the idea. Furthermore, the game simply lines up ships and has them slug it out. Thus, the game retains very little historical feel. Sub and cat-and-mouse carrier hunts are eliminated. The large air battles (Pearl Harbor, Midway, Coral Sea) are not well represented either. Lots of dice rolling means lots of luck involved. In the end, I like the game, but it is limited to light play. My gaming group has really enjoyed multi-player games with lots of units.

Very cool light naval game.  Has a great feel, and I really like the aircraft rules.  They should have used them in the Star Wars Starship game.  There have been complaints over some units being too powerful, but if you plan your fleet properly then it should even out (depth charge and torpedo carrying planes are your friend!)  The errata fixes a few small problems.  Oh, and the mini's look pretty darn good too!I prefer to use larger fleets on 2 sets of maps as I like the extra room to manuever.  I keep the air rules as is for this, however if using a bigger playing area than that you may need to adjust (there are decent house rules out there for just such an occasion.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I was so excited when this game was released.  After playing it a few times I decided that the game was turned into a game where if you don't play aircrafts you auto lose and this is no fun.  Changed one of the rules to if a ship is destroyed by aircraft it still gets a shot if in range to other ships made it more playable.  With that in mind the miniatures are real cool but have been sitting unplayed for 6 years.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I have mixed feelings about this. It's obviously a light wargame that's designed to play very quickly, and I feel like it's pointless to downvote it excessively for comparing poorly to something with a heavier ruleset. But given the substantial monetary investment required to create a decent fleet, it feels out of balance to be getting such a quick and simple dice-chucker. The biggest defect is the undersized map, which forces carriers to fight to the death in close proximity to battleships once they become cornered by the invisible walls of the map edge.

I'm still giving this an 8, on the assumption that the (impressively sculpted and decently painted) ships can be reappropriated for use in other miniature naval wargames. I also feel like I'm doing my part to strike back against a colletible market that's oversaturated with sf and fantasy games. The fact that Hasbro has given up on releasing more sets is a small tragedy.

I played a couple games and its playable, the rules are workable but it sure wasn't naval combat. The ships could have been tanks, spaceships, wizards, they were simply a game unit with attacks and defense. Oh, but wait, the ships have a superpower/special ability that WWII ships didn't really have. The only part of the game that simulated naval warfare was the miniatures. If you're already a fan of naval wargames you should stay away from this game.

Crap and dice. With minis.

Great miniatures, boring game.
A lot of things to shake your head at here, but for me the movement characteristics are the top offender.  Too dull overall.

5 rating is for the game only.  A score for sheer collectability of the ships would be much higher.

RATING: 6.5
Battle results are believeable, it's fast playing as ship facing has no impact (so forget crossing the "T").  A 100 point fleet is too small, unless you'd like to do CL and DD engagements...  Still, a single BC can whip a group of CL and DD's, no problem (unless the dice God is not with you).The collectability part is a real pain, making this a money pit.  I purchased a starter and a sealed case (12 boosters), and only had about 520 points per side.  Picked up a second sealed case, and am still missing 5 rare units.  After all, there are 24 rare units in the set, so 24 boosters is the minimum you need to purchase if you'd like to have all the units (without going thru eBay).Another odd factor is the uncommon units.  Since there are only FIVE units in a booster, three are common, 1 is uncommon, and 1 is rare, there is not much difference between rare and uncommon, or so one would think.

I have been playing and collecting for years and have most of the minis(close to 400-500 ships) and all the custom decks to date. The game is somewhere between a historical WW2 naval war simulation and a beer and pretzels style minis game. Prepaitned minis and a simple rule set( compared to most games like this) are a definite plus. The game is still heavy play wise and can take hours to play. One of my favorites.

The Naval version of the axis and allies miniature game is more fun than the ground version.  The ships are beautiful and the rules are more engaging.  The ships have interesting characteristics and the game works with multilpe players, provided you have the space to use more game maps and accomodate cards and pieces.  Better replay value in same day than the ground based miniatures game.  Very fun.  Can take a long time to complete.  Involves resolving abilities and using dice.

As a "operational" naval game I can see some of these mechanics making some sense.  But the movement is so bizarre that I am assuming each turn equals a day?  The aircraft rules are massively broken, with land based better than carrier cause they are cheaper and less vulnerable.  Torpedos fire every turn and make the Sub the most cost efficient battle unit versus surface combatants.  Use the minis with a real set of rules like General Quarters.

A very good "Beer & Pretzles" Naval Wargame that recreates the feel and flavor of the actual conflict.

My negative on the game is its "collectable" format and the fact that one could (and, um... did) spend hundreds of dollars and still not have everything one wants.

Another good introductory wargame.  It's fun to play but not too rules intensive.  My 12-year old picked it up from just watching me solo a few turns.

The collectible aspect makes it difficult to assemble historical forces cheaply, but the singles available online aren't much more expensive than other historical figures.  Getting enough aircraft for competive games may be expensive with the first two sets being hard to get now.

After buying what has to be the worst Starter *ever*, I didn't even want to admit owning this game.  I dislike the collectible game concept and crappy Starters and Boosters are just one of the reasons.  But the *game* is getting some good buzz, so I'm willing to give it a chance.  I'll wait until I've played the game a few times before I give it a rating.  Not a big fan of miniatures games, but sometimes you just have to drink the Kool-aid.

Good game of naval combat. Nothing spectacular regarding the rules set, but the rules work very smooth and fine and you really enjoy this fast-paced combat. Especially since there are no ground terrain rules (he! *g*) so the game is much faster and funnier then AHs ground-combat-miniatures-game. But there ARE still some flaws - you really NEED a all-big-gun-ship (BB) to survive because only one BB on the other side will eat up all of your cruisers and destroyers without really suffering damage itself. That´s a bit pitty. Yes, battleships ARE expansive, but they can handle with three or four cruisers... All DDs suffer from submarines, main-battery-attacks and air-attacks to much. But in general I like it. Fast, light wargame with cool miniatures. But there are many faults at the miniatures too - for example the secondary artillery on board of the Bismarck is attached wrong. 

So... Potential for more? No. Nice game, nothing more.

My introduction to wargaming as an adult.  I had played Axis & Allies some as a kid, but always liked the naval stuff the best.  Then this came along and pulled me in.

It's ok, and a fun game to introduce people to the hobby (fun little toys!), but it is just dice rolling olympics.  It feels like there is no strategy (or rather, what's there is easily undone by excessive randomness).  I've moved on.

For MANY years, I literally BEGGED the big American plastic modelkit companies ... Revell, Aurora, Monogram, Lindberg ... to come out with smallscale 1:1200 Japanese and American task force sets, accompanied by simple play/gaming rules, but they just couldn't see the market potential of play and gaming.

And now the biggest toy manufacturer in the world, Hasbro, has done it! using the Wizards of the Coast Magic collectible sets format and producing unique scale 1:1800 models of all the major classes of World War 2 ships.

This is a FANTASTIC gateway game introduction to the naval wargaming hobby.  

There is an obvious and basic fallacy to Richard Baker's adaptation of the Risk/Axis&Allies combat system:  both accuracy and penetration are resolved by the same throw of the dice, so big ships have a disproportionate advantage.  (For realism, I prefer my own Naval Action rules, thank you.)

But WHO CARES?  :) It's FUN, especially for kids.

The miniatures vary in quality, but some of the paint jobs are fascinating (and quite accurate), despite the small scale.  A concern is the easily warped soft plastic of the smaller, Common ships ... as well as their questionable smell, if not (toxic?) fumes.

There are ship inaccuracies:  HMS Renown is falsely identified as its not identical sistership Repulse, and the Italian heavy cruiser Zara is actually sistership Pola with its enclosed superstructure, but considering there are 200 models now, mistakes have been relatively few.

THANK YOU, Hasbro/Wizards/Avalon Hill!!

Presented as a collectible only damages this game's worth. The great thing about it is that each ship and aircraft has special abilities and stats defining them as unique units. For instance, certain Japanese ships and subs get a bonus for their Long Lance torpedoes which is better than say, Naval battles, where a 14"cannon does the same damage as an 18".  The ships are pre-painted and are sculpted pretty well considering the origins of this game.  An actual board for the game would have been nice compared to the shoddy, overproduced and bent map they provide you with in the starter packs.  Still, a fun, lite-ww2 naval combat game, though unit descriptions border on being westernly chauvanistic.

Plaus 2. Naval war game. Some might object to referring to WaS as a wargame. Tough titty. Its my comment box and I'll call it a wargame.

that being said my initial objections to this were:
price - $15 for 5 miniature
Compared to other CMGs this is very expensive (though notably less expensive than FFGs Mutant Chronicles CMG) 
Model count not suitable to sealed play
With 5 models per pack you need 3 packs for reasonable sealed deck play

Later reflections on initial objections
Price - compared to non-painted naval miniature WaS is actually CHEAP. 
The game is less CMG, more pre-painted naval models with a pasted on game. 

Sealed deck - the product was never intended for CxG nerds like me. WaS targets model enthusiast with the lure of relative inexpensive pre-painted models (albeit in a scale no one really uses...)

It's fun to play with these nice miniatures. Tactical warfare dominates, but sometimes you need to make strategic (positional) decisions too. So the game looks a bit like chess with mini-ships.

07/06/13 Played a hypothetical scenario between Russians and Italians. We used a slightly enlarged laminated mapsheet to avoid the multi-fold original that is impossible to make it lay flat. The ships look very nice, but the larger ones are too big for the map squares. I'm not a miniature gamer. So the "drool" factor of the detailed & painted ships means almost nothing to me. Plus I'm not a fan of the entire of Axis & Allies game line. (Nor the "pig in a poke" way they sell the boosters sets). So I was not looking forward to this game. Yet I ended up liking it more than I thought I would. The units cards were clear and the rules as they were related to me were straightforward. Still, it was one of those "that was nice, once" type of games to me. I might play it again, but it wouldn't bother me if not for well over a year.

I've been waiting for this game for a while.  I've managed to pick up a few ships and have been able to play a few games.  Pretty fun.  It's what Starship Battles could have been.

After a few plays, I still like the game.  The ships are really well done but the rules are a bit on the simple side.  Battleships pretty much reign supreme and carriers can't do enough damage before the Battleship is in range.  Destroyers are mostly useless.  Torpedoes are pretty much useless the way the rules are written since the ships that use them will generally be gone before they can launch a salvo.

With some tweaks, this could be a better game.

UPDATED O.K. Now I'm hooked, It really is a good game once you get to scale. ADVICE - buy single commons on line (cheap) to fill out your fleet.

It's o.k., but I hoped for more considering the price. Not as good as many naval games, but fun enough. Just way to pricy for what you get. Mini's are cool, but the game is just an 'eh'.

The game system itself is way to simplistic. The movement system resembles more a game of checkers than it does naval combat. It's an ok 2 player filler but it doesn't take long for players to see the problems with the rules. On the other hand the minis are fantastic. My group is using the minis with the General Quarters 3 naval miniature rules set. So I give this game a 10 for the great minis and a 0 for the simplistic rules for an average of 5.

War at Sea is a fun, light naval wargame.  It works well for me because I can get in a game at lunch with a coworker.  I enjoy games with a deck/army building aspect to them, and War at Sea does an especially good job of scratching that itch because there is (more or less) a good foil for every strategy.  You have to consider all the different unit types when constructing your fleet.  The game uses a lot of dice, but I like rolling dice, and the combat is quick and pretty intuitive.

On the downside, it does seem that submarines are a little too powerful.  They are only vulnerable to anti-submarine attacks, and these are the least common.  In addition, those that exist are either very weak, on very fragile ships, or both.  In addition, the games that I've played didn't involve a whole lot of strategic movement.  Each player would try to stay away from the enemy (if they had longer range) or close in (if they had shorter), and exchange fire with bombers and fighters.  In the end the game is quick and fun, but it has its flaws, and can be quite expensive.  The miniatures, however, are very nice and I like that they are relatively in scale.

Bit of a dice fest.  The mini's are truly first rate.  The rules are too simple for my taste, and I find that the forces aren't terribly balanced.  The US, in general, wins.  Not a ton of strategy.  You set out the ships.  Move them forward a bit, then pound the crap out of each other.  Fun at times, for a filler, but don't look to it to find anything overly gratifying.  Bragging that you won this game will earn you no respect.

I gave this to my son for his 11th birthday and we have had a tremendous amount of fun with it. Playing this right after we watched the "Battle of River Plate" was great. After watching "Sink the Bismark" it became a classic for us. I agree with all of the bad things that people say about it but it has been worth EVERY PENNY that I have put into it. I bought two starters and two boosters and then picked up the rest on Ebay. My son was not particularly into miniatures or naval games but this hit all the right notes for us.

A simple CMG dicefest with nice bits. A lot simpler than A&A Miniatures, even though the cards look similar.

The balance between surface attacks, torpedoes, and aerial attacks is quite intriguing. I definitely need more boosters to really figure out the subs and aircraft. [edit: got them now, testing will follow]

The Task Force boosters do not have a checklist in the box. The set also includes lots of repaints, some of which look [i]very[/i] similar to their base set counterparts. They even used the same set number for a repainted sub in both sets! On the other hand, the boosters are nicely randomized: From my 12 boosters I got all the uncommons and commons in the set, and no doubles in rares or uncommons.

Note to self; from the first two sets, I have:
- all submarines
- all planes
- all auxiliaries
- all torpedo boats twice
- 3+3 carriers
- the missing 7 rare carriers and missing regular ships are listed in 'Want Parts'
- also have the 2010 starter, 8/8 units

An OK dicefest, but that's all it really is. With small builds (150 points) it becomes a guessing game to build units that can exploit the other side's vulnerabilities without have any yourself.

The models are terrific and would be great to own except it's a collectible game and would be too expensive to aquire.

This game represents naval combat at its pinnacle.  The romance of the great ships of WWII resurrected once again to engage each other is enough to purchase this one.  The simple mechanics of the game allow for a quick start and fast play, but as can be noted on it's geek game page many variants and rule mods already exist to expand the realism.  The game mat is lackluster but that can certainly be replaced for a minor investment.  My only other frustration is the large dollar figure required (not to get started but) to collect the respective fleets which becomes an obsession after the initial purchase.

This collectable plastic minatures is designed to let you build your own fleet.  This is done by using the assigned point values to units.  You play on any large flat surface.  The objective is to play to a specified point level.  This is done by either capturing objectives and/or sinking your opponants ships.  Pay careful attention to the notes on each individual card for special abilities.  The special abilities can make the difference.

I find the game a little too simple. It has become more of a collection/collectors choice than a gaming choice. Probably brought on by the randomness of what is in the package.

The game itself recommends a balanced approach between sides (equal points) but the advantage goes to the side with the more heavily armored ships.

The battles are innovative in the use of the die, but leave one unsatisfied with the results which are really more luck than anything else.

The game looks good, and is great for imagining epic battles, but the strategy isn't there - at least I haven't found it yet

Light, but deep Naval Game. Very enjoyable to play and the minis are nice. Too bad its collectible as it will take a bit of $ to get a nice set of fleets to play. Rate is after one play. I will be getting more minis and adjust my ratings after a few more plays.

Lowered my rating a bit after a few plays. The game is a bit tight with space and the good mini's cost. While enjoy the game, the two player only limits its scope of playability.

The ship cards are the real stars of this game. They give each ship a unique character which helps make the game more immersive. The ship models are fine but could be substituted with any brand of miniatures or even cardboard cut outs if you had to. Definitely the best miniatures game delivered by axis and allies. Better than the air and land versions.

Okay, I love playing with the little toy ships. I admit it. Sure I've gone a bit overboard with bases and storage and such. Sure my wife calls it my "plastic crack." It is fun and the game is fun to play as well.

Bought them because I liked the miniatures.
Probably would have bought more if my shop had not run out. Really nice for just collecting.

Less impressed with the paper gameboard.
 
Currently on display, but low of on my list of games still to play. So many good games.

Got a bunch of boosters at a wicked discount.  Love the sculpts.  I need to get some carriers!  Score is primarily only for the quality of the miniatures compared to the discount I received (half to three quarters off).

Updated rating: After slowly acquiring more pieces as gifts and clearance finds, I have passable fleets for larger engagements. Wish I had the table space to play the larger-scale variant (played over 2 maps w/ scout planes).

I suspect satisfaction w/ this game will increase as the fleets (and playability options) grow. (But cost concerns expressed below still apply.)

Rating: 6.5 (from 5.5)

...

I'm split on this one. I picked up a starter and booster to see if I'd enjoy it as a game. The miniatures are the real draw. If I were being sarcastic, I'd say the "game" offers deep resource management decisions and is ultimately about one's thirst for war.

That is, strictly in terms of game-play, the real-life costs of building even a small fleet is much better spent elsewhere. At worst, it is a perverse implementation of collectibles: Since pieces are randomized, you may get some that are only playable against future acquisitions. That makes for a disturbingly high entry cost for a lite beer-&-pretzels game.

This is really only for those that *love* the miniatures themselves - which, again, are fantastic. Strictly from a collectible miniatures standpoint, eBay is the way to go. Game-play is really an afterthought and a detriment to the actual pieces.

First, I'm a sucker for pre-painted miniatures...I don't want to think of all the various scale ship models I've bought over the years and never finished...sooo A&A Naval was a godsend.  I know some fine scale modelers disagree, but I find the ships  attractive and true to their originals.  Biggest complaint is some of the warping on the submarines and smaller ships.  Fixed with a dip of hot water.  Second, I am not interested in the super-detail of most naval game rules.  I do not care to track the path of each individual shell and torpedo.  Thus, the rules are ok with me, especially with the recently added revisions.  They are very basic, but create a fun game.  As tests, I've played a half-dozen River Plate games and a couple Bismark vs Hood games.  In general, they work out fairly well, with both sides having a shot at victory.  I do recommend replacing the hard-to-read map with a blue 4" hex-grid battlemap (I got mine from Hotz Artworks).  Makes facing simp

Miniature naval battle game.  It plays similar to the original Axis & Allies board game, but the battle zone is of a smaller scale.  Each naval unit is unique with different stats and special abilities.  The game simulates two small fleets which may include air units launching from a base.  Most of the battle is played with naval units moving on the board.  The air units move very fast according to scale being able to attack any unit when deployed.

Full Collection + all unofficial add-on decks. 

Enjoyable game that let's you push around ships, squadron, and subs in a quick and playable format. The collectible issue is a downer, but most ships are available as singles purchase (or you can buy whole lots off of Ebay at this point).

It's not super detailed or 'realistic' but it's fun and gives enough of a feel for naval combat that the game holds together well.

I upped my rating to 8.  I've realized that I probably never will turn down a game, because it's fast and varied enough that there's rarely a reason to turn down a game.  

It suits what I am looking for in a WWII naval game.  It is rules light, but pretty enough, and doesn't require painting (I've done my share and don't want to paint anymore).  That said, collectibility is a concern, and I can't recommend it if you aren't comfortable with having multiple people buy, or a single person dropping $250 over time.  It isn't just the rares!  My first boosters left me with carriers of nations without enough planes to use on them!  Other nations had planes and no carriers.  It takes lots of boosters (perhaps eighteen), or trading to make two fleets with a good number of choices.

Great for WWII Naval wargaming lite. Not too complex and can be fairly quick to play. I like this a lot better than the Axis and Allies land minis game. Just do not walk into this one expecting high level, complex play. You can also start playing with the minimal investment of a starter and two boosters. My only two knocks are: 1) Some of the rules are a little over-simplified (subs, facing, battleships are a little broken) but can be fixed with house rules.  2) Collectible minis game (that sucking noise you hear is your money being vacuumed away).

This game is a great miniature strategy game. So many different miniatures with the boosters. I like that you can customize the size of the game you're playing by deciding how many starting points each player begins with. I also like the aerial warfare aspect also. If you Love Axis and Allies this is for you.

This is less complicated than the land version of Axis & Allies Miniatures, mainly because of terrain considerations, but this is a blast to play & very visually appealing. We've just scratched the surface on strategies for fleet construction.

RATING: N/A
The minis are great but as 4 sets out of print horrendously expensive!!
The game it self is not very good, the paper maps are a joke!!
Other problems you need a massive table to do a 500 point game and the cards along side add to that, Most of the big battleships are nigh on impossible to damage even with air!
The Convoy system is unworkable and the attacking player almost always wins!!
You need a Second mortgage to collect all the fleets all for bits of plastic!!
Some of the minis have bad paint jobs although you can custom paint them!!
The aircraft in my opinion are wrong scale, they are suppoused to look like they are flying above the ships!!
You need a very large bank account as some of the rares easily fetch around £40 gbp And if you want class limits, new counters, replacement mat, bases etc it is easily going to set you back around 5,000 GBP which is ridiculous for bits of plastic!!

Я бы не сказал что мне нравится качество миниатюр. Различать их кстати тоже не просто, впрочем у меня пока только база.

Игровое поле мягкое и большое (раскладушка). Его только под стекло.

Сама игра... Ну это лучше SW-миниатюр вроде. Хотя рандом при обстреле огромный. Скажем в обучающем сценарии, который предлагается в базе сразу, японскому крейсеру достаточно выбросить правильно один кубик чтобы тут же затопить американца.

Интерес однако должен зависеть от сценариев. Просто стенка на стенку имхо не интересно. Однако со сценариями я еще не знакомился.

I've been waiting for this type of game for years. At first glance, I thought the squadrons of aircraft would bog down play, but Wizards did an excellent job at making the rules simple but adequate. The gameplay is smooth and the battles are well balanced. The only drawback is the collectability factor. The battleships and rare cruisers sell for $10 to $14 dollars... best to buy a case for cheap and sell what you don't need on e-bay. Regardless, I'm looking forward to the next set and perhaps some Russian ships. Kamikaze rules and perhaps rules to incorporate the land-battles with war at sea would be welcome.

Well I've never done it til now but I'll give the game a 10 to counteract a whiney, retarded rating of a one given on the basis of marketing and not on the merit of the game itself.  Otherwise my actual rating remains in the high 8's to low 9's. For now my 10 stays until the 1 disappears. As for the game, dare I say this one is even better than AA:M.  Well it is for me.  This game plays fast and is usually over in 5 turns however the rules are well thought out and game play at the basic level is even more engaging than with the ground mini's version.  The different phases for air, ship, and torpedo attacks allow for more strategies on the fleet builds.  The sculpts are great (on a good, great, fantastic scale) and you really don't need more than one of each rare figure and usually only one of each uncommon to play out historical scenarios.  I haven't found a "broken" build yet based on a 100 or 150 point scenario.  Realistically, a starter and 2-4 boosters will give you a playable game for two players for about $50 online.  Expect lots of dice rolling and hope for 6's.

Surprising enjoyable if lightweight - its more akin to pushing ships across the table aka battle of Britain films, than classic stat & paperwork heavy naval wargames. Don't get addicted or it gets expensive quick. Bit battleship favoured, but increased board size with more objectives helps to even it out.

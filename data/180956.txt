GAME: One Night Ultimate Vampire
RANK: 1541

RATING: 7
An hour of playing this made for a highly confusing time, after which we decided it was good. I think more games required to determine if it is actually good and or worth playing instead of ultimate werewolf, which is definitely a hike in complexity/fiddliness from.

This has become more of a complex deduction game with some controlled chaos and I think that's a result of having both cards and marks in play. We find that players who were turned off by the chaotic elements of ONUW with stuff moving around in the night had a much better response to Vampire than the original two games. Second, the new roles are really well done, even if some of them are just ONUW2.0 roles (e.g. Renfield -> Minion). In particular, the Copycat is a great improvement over the Doppelganger, if for no other reason that it doesn't have this perpetual errata or exception clause that follows it around from game to game. It also gives you more of a "knife fight" sort of effect as it's essentially a filler role (it eliminates 1 of the 3 center night actions that wouldn't normally happen, thus giving more certainty to what happened at night).

The downside to Vampire, and probably the reason I'll be hesitant to incorporate it with ONUW for a long time is that the mark system is really sort of clunky, especially if you don't have a lot of things that use the marks. To that end, this feels like a game where you have some games that are solidly Vampire based, and some games where you steal out the roles which don't use marks and incorporate them into ONUW. Overall, recommended for fans, but not as a first One Night experience.

I picked this up for a gaming group I host for friends of mine that are new to gaming and more into the party/social deduction set of games than I am... but,
I was really pleasantly surprised at how well this game plays out and how much thought you can really put into it. It is currently my #1 favorite social deduction game.

Ok, but even more fiddly than ONUW. Can be mixed in with ONUW but often that just makes things extra wobbly. The vampires biting another means you often get either two or none, which makes it less good with lower player counts.

1st play: Significantly more confusing on the first plays than One Night Werewolf.  I play these games a lot with my kids (7 & 9) and wife (Non Gamer) and they were completely confused after the first play.  I reset everything and did a recap, step by step, to show them where things moved and how marks and cards interact.  After this we played a couple more games, and by the 3rd play, they mostly understood what was going on.  I'll have to play a few more times to see if the payoff is worth the extra learning curve.

2nd play: Unfortunately for my group, there isn't much appetite for this kind of game anymore.  I think it's enjoyable but without people to play it with, it will likely languish on the self as it's entirely group dependent and it's one step more complex than ONUW - which puts it out of reach of playing with new people.

RATING: 8.5
Provisional rating after a couple proxied plays. Definitely fun, but extends the length pretty significantly because the dusk phase takes almost as long as a night phase, AND there is much more to consider with the additional layer of marks on top of cards. The assassin is a really fun role, the way that he can find allies on either team is very cool. Diseased is also an interesting addition, and makes tournament scoring more interesting long term because he reduces the number of winners potentially. We only played standalone, will be very interesting to play with the other sets. Ted Alspach can do pretty much no wrong though, it's looking like more and more.

Not had chance to play this.  I was in the last batch of Kickstarter deliveries and my game group had already played it and didn't like it as much as ONUW.

Disappointing printing errors with icons missing off a couple of cards and mistakes in the rule book add to the poor feeling about this game.

As a big fan of One Night, I had high hopes for this standalone expansion. I felt like the marks made the game much slower and much more chaotic (and the game is already plenty chaotic). Maybe it is better when played alone, but that is not what I bought it for. Probably will never play with this again.

Killer that it not only plays with its own feel (but similar mechanics to Werewolf), but it can also be integrated with both Werewolf and Daybreak for a really wild time. However, you definitely want to ease people into one or the other first, before confusing them with all the potential roles. Good times, good artwork.

After playing a few different ones I've discovered that I'm not a huge fan of social deduction games. That being said, this is a fun quick game for a group of people. The fewer people who play the less interesting it is. When it comes right down to it, however, these types of games are more about social interaction than interesting game-play.

Can be a fun game, however, the ending is a little open ended and leaves most of the groups we play with more confused than anything else. We usually have to add house rules to make the game a little better. 

It's better to play with a narrator rather than use the Phone App. The phone app cuts off before the ending. The first time we tried the phone app, and it got to the end and just abruptly finished, literally everyone just lifted their heads and up and in unison went, "Whaaaat... do we start accusing people now?"

Despite the short comings, it's a fun game. I'd recommend it. Get a feel for it, add your own rules. Don't use the phone app.

Adds a great deal of complexity to the One Night experience without adding to the enjoyment.

The fun part of ONU_ is figuring out who is what, maybe confirming who you are, and watching somebody get into or out of a great big lie.

The additional complexity undermines this, increasing uncertainty in your own role, as well as that of others, causing the game to feel much more random, which makes the logical deducing of what happened much less satisfying, and ultimately undermines the accomplishment of a well constructed lie.

Overall, very disappointed.

Conflicted with this one.   I love the original and daybreak, and my first impression is that this one isn't quite as good.   The problem I think is that the bites and stuff seem to add complexity yet not really advance the gameplay that much.   Still, it's early and perhaps a few more plays will improve my thoughts on this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not a bad evolution of One Night Ultimate Werewolf but a little more kludgy.  The extra layer of Marks tactically is somewhat enticing, but it's convoluted enough that I would stay away unless you want to change up your plays of One Night Ultimate Werewolf.  

I will say that this is a hell of a lot better than One Night Revolution.  Still, it comes up short of its main predecessor and probably not worth the extra trouble.

Based on 2 plays:

REALLY unsure how I feel about this so far. I have to say, we generally found the game confusing. The strategy here is much more opaque than in ONUW, and I'm not sure the game benefits from the shift up in complexity.

It feels like the us-vs-them team focus has been lost, in favor of uncovering individual identities and agendas. Some part of the fun social aspect is lost in that, I feel.

I definitely need to play this more to nail down a real impression. I think my rating is going to shift pretty dramatically once I feel I have a firmer grip on the game.

I love ONUWerewolf, so I though ONUVampire would be a big hit as well. However, unfortunately it's not. And I think the main reason is the added fiddlyness of the tokens as well as the extra phase called dawn. It just bogs down a little too much compared to ONUW. If I hadn't played ONUW, I would probably play ONUV a lot more, but as it is, ONUW wins in every aspect. ONUAlien is coming out in 2017, and that one might be as great as ONUW, but time will tell.

Great expansion for ONUW. It adds a lot of complexity to the game, but it also adds a lot of diversity too (which it needs when you play as much as I do).

It gets a lower rating than ONUW and Daybreak due to the confusing roles and lack of standalone fun. As an expansion, it's amazing if you have enough people.

Sadly, this game was a big disappointment for me. Tried about 10 games but still lack any good information/arguments for my negotiation at the end. Because too much might be changed and I never know if I am arguing for me or against me. So the blind arguing is not the game for me, better to throw a dice at the end and decide who win will give me more fun....sorry!

A group deduction game where everyone tries to figure out who the Vampires are (think Murder in the Dark).  Each player has a different role and does different things during the set of of play by manipulating roles and outcomes.  Then all players discuss the outcome and make their guesses.

I love the app that accompanies this game!

I like this a lot better than its werewolf equivalent. Werewolf leaves you with absolutely no idea who you are and what team you are on, while Vampire you have more of a clue and more to work with. In fact your alliance might change but  your character can't be changed.
Unless that %$#@&%$ gremlin is on the table!! You ruined everything you horrible little agent of chaos! I won't forget this!

The previous game often left players struggling to remain hidden, but this one often results in the Vampire group becoming larger than the Villager group, requiring players take much more care to the negotiation to work out which side is numerically stronger prior to committing to one. The fact that is it demonstrably worse to identify oneself as a villager makes negotiations much more tense.

The game does suffer from a wont of basic roles from the original game, and card backs are different.

Only played this with Werewolf and Daybreak characters included, so I can't speak for the base game alone, but the addition of tokens made the game feel more tactical and therefore much more enjoyable for me. We also didn't use any boring villagers and instead used characters such as masons and prince to at least give everyone something special and that was much more fun.

I actually like this a fair bit. The marks add another layer of depth to the game that keeps things interesting. However this being a social game to a certain extent it runs the risk of falling flat depending on the group, and one night werewolf is definitely better for beginners because of how simple it is. Vampire is a nice change of pace though, I can't wait to mix match characters.

Takes the excellent One Night Ultimate Werewolf and adds new mechanics and roles with the marks. Some of the new roles are really fun (the thing that goes bump in the night, instigator and the assassins) and others so so (The vampires) While there is rarely enough information to make a confident accusations in any game of ONUW, the movement of both roles and marks in Vampire adds another layer of obfuscation I really dislike. I think I'll play without the priest or roles that allow you to move marks. ie the Pickpocket and Gremlin. The added complexity means that this game is really only for those who have played base ONUW and are comfortable with it. Still a reasonably good expansion to the series with enough interesting roles to inject some freshness into the game. Warning Not worth it as a standalone or for begginers.

I appreciate the addition to the One Night Ultimate series, but I can't say we take this game out for play very much. Unlike it's Werewolf version, we found it to contain way too many bits to keep track of, too much going on during night/dusk phases and a lack of what initially attracted us to the One Night Ultimate series: It's simplicity.

Of course, if you don't mind some slightly more complicated roles and loved it's Werewolf sister game, you may enjoy this. But I am not one to recommend this game as long as One Night Ultimate Werewolf exists.

not for the shy, or those that can't lie or strategize lying very well
for a party game, does require central table and room to move for eyes-closed portions and hiding movement/noises from neighbors


Similar games in my collection: The Resistance, Avalon, Mascarade, One Night Ultimate Werewolf, Deception: Murder in Hong Kong

RATING: 8.5
I love One Night Ultimate Werewolf and I love Vampire even more. I love the deduction, lies, and all the interaction. The tokens add a fun new layer to the game. I think it's a little easier to lie in this than Werewolf because of them.

(3/17) 5. I LOVE the One Night games, but this one is just too convoluted.  Too many different win conditions with too many different ways for those win conditions to be changed by all the different powers.  Never feels like you actually have any info to go on.

Additional dusk phase and more tokens makes it a bit more confusing for players. One Night Ultimate Vampire makes the One Night Ultimate Werewolf game and makes it a little too fiddly for me. I'd still be willing to play it if someone wanted to, but I'd rather play ONUW instead.

Great game, very similar to the base game.
Adds marks, tokens, that works almost as a second role card to add more confusion and twists in loyalty.
I think the original is a better designed game because of being so good while still being very simple. This game is suitable for those who already played the first one a lot and want to extend the experience more.

Great game for experienced One Night Ultimate Werewolf fans. Adds some fun complexity to the game. Lots of new characters and game mechanics that cause roles to change and players to stab each other in the back and affect the game in new and interesting ways (traitors, assassins, diseased). This game flopped with new players but people that have lots of ONUW games under their belt really liked it.

Only have played a few games of this now, but ONUV takes the ONUW formula and puts it through a turn for the worse in my opinion. Some of the simplicity is lost and a marks mechanic is added which adds more complexity for little gain in my opinion. The depth of deduction is still similar to before and much of the game remains the same but now there is just more to sort through and worry about. It's interesting and still fun, but I'm having a hard time figuring out why I'd be playing this instead of ONUW/Daybreak.

This game adds complexity to the ONUW system, adding new roles and round tokens called "Marks" to the game. Also, now there are two rounds to the game: a Dusk cycle and then the Night cycle. While I'm glad I have this in my collection, my group still prefers ONUW to ONUV. 

After 8 plays, I'm of the opinion that this game will work better with larger player counts. Most of my games have been with four people so I'm interested in playing Vampire with 6-8 sometime to see if the Marks really begin to pop.

I still need to play it with some non-gamers (especially my teenage kids who love One Night Werewolf) to see if the added complexity causes issues.

But the games I had with my gamer friends were a hoot.  Definitely more strategy, bluffing and deduction to be had than One Night Werewolf.

[Bézier Games 15 edition] {Vampire; social deduction; scalable} I love One Night Ultimate Werewolf.  So I welcome additional packs to increase fun and replayabilty.  I also love cute vampires :)

It is more challenging than the basic game and longer.  A game is split into two phases: Dust and Night.  In additional, there is an additional marker for a player to affect their roles and actions.

ONUV is very similar to [thing=147949][/thing], except instead of just having a role you also get a mark.  The roles don't get swapped as much, but the marks can make you change teams, become lovers with someone else, or other crazy things.  So it's like ONUW, but with an extra level of complexity.  I generally don't like social deduction games, but ONUW is tolerable for me.  I don't feel like it needed more complexity, but if you do you should check it out.

Evil vampires join the fray as a third distinct team! This one also adds 'marks', small tokens that affect your victory conditions possibly making you a vampire, a traitor against your own team, or fall in love with another player dependent on each others lives.

Its /okay/ by itself, but mixed with the others its best.

Sleeved.

[Children's Game] 
I should note that unlike all of the other kids games in my collection that I play with my two young children the label of Children's Game here means something entirely different. If you are not a child when you start playing this you quickly will become one!! Great game for parties or anytime you just want to laugh your ass off. I love Haba games in general mostly because I love how much my kids enjoy them. This one is different in that everyone has a great time. So much fun it's probably illegal in many parts of the country!

RATING: 7
Great for playing with kids or adults that aren't shy, but you need to clear space around the table first, and get any breakables far, far away.  The reason for this is that part of the game may require you to run around the table, with the eggs tucked into various positions, and a winning strategy is to do something to force one of the other players to get delayed or drop an egg as they race around the table.  In my world some serious body checks happen in the race around the table.  I like to play with people bigger than me so that the chances of me hurting them are lower.  That will give you an indication of how I play.

Also in this game you bounce one of the rubber eggs off of the table and the first one to catch it gets it which can also lead to mayhem.  Get the table as small as possible by taking out any extra leaves, so everyone can be near the center.  One set of eggs will allow you to play with 2-4 people, but you can always buy a second set of eggs if you want to play with more people.

Hilarious goofy children game, that catches even adults in uncontrollable laughter!
Acquire eggs in various ways and store them in different places of your body (armpits, betwneen knees, etc.) trying to avoid letting them fall.
It's a party game, and it's funny with the right people in the right moment...
I'd say it deserves an 8 with children and a 5 with (non-drunk) adults only.

RATING: 7
I haven't had the opportunity to fully open this game up for maximum fun because we played in a very confined space so we had to improvise a rule variant instead of running around the table. Even with that minor tweak, I could definitely see the chaotic fun of Dancing Eggs. In fact it can be just as funny as a spectator sport, just watching the awkward look of a person trying to play a game with eggs shoved in their armpits and under their chin. I can't wait to play this one with the youth at our church, because it is the kind of silly fun that young people will really enjoy and appreciate. Another good game that will hold a spot in my collection.

Haven't liked this one as much as I have thought.  The kids enjoy it from time to time, though, so I don't regret getting it.  

It can cause arguments, however:  e.g. disputes over who got back to his or her chair first, disputes over the fairness of a roll of the die that trickled toward one kid and out of reach of another kid (making it impossible for the other kid to grab the die, which is a problem when grabbing the die is the required option). So if your kids tend to be disputatious, beware. 

My wife can't stand the game and refuses to play. 

UPDATE:  Raising to a 6 in light of the fact that this is a game that the kids will take out and play on their own when friends come over.

A fun activity for most people that creates lots of laughter.  Watch out for egg-related injuries!

However, I actually have way more fun watching others play rather than playing myself and getting fingernailed and run over by other players.  It's hilarious watching other people tackle each other over a bouncing rubber egg; less hilarious when you're the one getting tackled.

This game is genius. Its quirky and odd. Its playful and quick. Its classy and eye-catching. It works well in a situation where you are just waiting for another table to finish up to recombine groups, etc, at a con....but also can be played by a family.

We add a house rule that a player MUST complete the circuit around the table, even if the egg is already won. 

THIS IS FOR NASHVILLE!

Hilarious. Really fun, light game. I love it when everyone has eggs tucked in awkward places and the run around the table option is rolled. 

I've found this works best in a large game night where I've set up different games in different places. It's quick to teach and I can leave a group playing it and help someone else get started on a game.

Players roll a die that instructs the players how an egg will enter the game (a rubber egg, not a real one).  The player who gets the egg then rolls a dice to tell them where to store the egg - under chin, between legs, etc.  Play goes on until one player loses an egg accidentally - the player holding the most eggs wins the game.  Crazy, looney game that works really well.  Great ice breaker.

Considering this is a kids' game, younger kids certainly seem to be disadvantaged at this one.  Fun enough with adults, especially if they've been drinking.  Also the components are very cool, especially the rubber eggs.

The kids who played my copy found it too difficult, and I guess I never found the right group of drunk adults willing to play it. Not sure why it turned out to never get played, because it's a great, silly concept.

My 2-year old grandson screamed and laughed for half an hour chasing the eggs about.  The game is indicated for 5-year olds so we played by our own rules (eliminating the wooden egg), throwing the die and rushing to get the eggs first.

The container is indeed flimsy--more flimsy than my regular egg cartons--therefore easy to replace, even if it won't have the label on top.  It probably will need to be replaced at some point because my grandson tremendously enjoys opening the carton and taking the eggs in and out.

RATING: 6.5
Fun dexterity game for kids!  The goal of the game is to have the most eggs at the end of the game.  First you roll a dice to know how an egg can be won.  It can be by dropping a bouncy egg and trying to catch it, running around the table and come back to your seat, etc.  The winner of the mini-game have to roll a dice to know where to put his egg.  It can be between his knees, under his chin, inside his elbows, etc.  The more eggs you have, the more difficult the mini-game will be.  The game ends when a player drops an egg and the player with the most eggs win.

As my partner carried this game toward the checkout desk of the BGG.CON library, multiple concerned people apparently approached to say, "You know that game will make you cluck like a chicken, don't you?"

It was a blast (in the way one wants 2am HABA games to be, not like, I don't know, Through The Ages) but in fact the game never made any of us cluck like chickens. I'm just saying.

Dec08: Well, that was silliness.  Do *not* take this serious.  Take this in the same vein as Eat Poop You Cat

How does it work as a silly game?  Pretty well.  It's always amusing to watch people act like retards because they have rubber eggs stored in their limbs.

We did have to house rule one part:

The rules say that on a certain roll you have to race around the table and sit back down.  That went *poorly*.  So we changed it to you had to get your ass on the ground and then back into the chair.  That went very well.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (February 2011)

ULTRA fun party game. My stomach hurts from all the laughing. This is a very simple, very quick game. Dancing Eggs plays very different from any other boardgame I have played, it’s a dexterity game that can be taught under 1 minute and played under 12 minutes.

The game box commands a lot of attention and the game components are pretty nice too.
 
I don’t want to play this all the time, but I’m usually open to it, the only problem is that you need to play it in an open space, otherwise you could get hurt (as I did).

A must buy in my book.

Dancing Eggs continues to be a game I enjoy. It is an unique game in my game collection and I don’t think I will ever sell it. However, I’m downgrading its rating to one I feel it matches my current feelings for the game with BGG´s rating system.

The game´s components are very good, it plays fast, you can explain the rules under one minute.

Current Rating: 6.0

Rating based on children's enjoyment of the game.  Great pieces - nice large dice are fun to roll.  The yellow eggs are really fun for the kids.  I would imagine that this could even potentially be more fun to play with adults than with kids.  But it's a great idea for a game, I don't have anything else quite like it.

Update: Yes - very enjoyable for adults as well - as long as no one cares about making a fool of him/herself, it's a hilarious game!

This one is a big hit or miss.  It's such a physical game that it makes some folks uncomfortable.  It's also one of those games where you have to want to win, but not care about whether you win or not at all.  So, heavily invested gamers will not enjoy this one.  I wouldn't say it is particularly good for kids, either, so it hasn't really been one of those smashing successes, but certain people have requested it repeatedly.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I'm not sure about it being much of a game but it sure was a fun team competition in a variant I made for 9 people. We kept playing until we were down to 4 people left and then whomever had the most eggs won. The student staff had a blast playing and there were quite a few moments where we broke up laughing at people. It was also affirmed by all present that no one liked keeping an egg between their head and shoulder.

This is a unique game that plays well with a mix a kids and adults.  An adequate, SAFE playing area is required!  It is somewhat physically demanding - running around the table, grabbing the die, holding "eggs" for extended periods of time, scrambling after bouncing eggs, etc.  The components are amazing and have a bid "wow" factor.  This is always a hit!

Sencillo y divertido. Ideal para fiestas, ya que con 2 hueveras puedes tener perfectamente para 8-10 jugadores. Lo más gracioso es ver las caras de sufrimiento de los jugadores cuando ya llevan un rato aguantando algún huevo bajo la barbilla o el brazo, o peor aún, cuando tienen que dar una vuelta alrededor de la mesa con huevos entre las rodillas. Ideal para jugar en exteriores y recomendado para todas las edades. Eso sí, no esperes jugar más de 2 o 3 partidas seguidas, porque aunque es corto se hace un poco aburrido al cabo del rato.

What an awesome, silly idea! Very short, very entertaining (even for those who aren't playing), but could use a little more "strategy"... would definitely play better with more eggs, as it stands now most players will only really have to balance 2-3 eggs for most of the game. But with two sets, this game shines!! (Rating is for one copy of the game only... otherwise, would probably rate an 8)

RATING: 7
A quick dexterity type game where players roll one die that invokes a contest to get an egg (catch an egg bounced off the table, etc.) and another die that tells the egg-winner where to stick it.  

It can be quite funny at times.  I found out that with an egg under my chin I'm pretty much a useless human being.  Rating could go up with more plays.

RATING: 8
This is a _very_ light game, wherein players roll a die to see if they get an egg (possibly having to perform an action to get said egg), and then roll another die to see where they have to hold said egg (possibilities include under their chin, between their knees, under their arm, in their elbow, or between their shoulder and head).  The first player to drop an egg loses, at which point the player with the most eggs wins.  This is a fun party game that requires a lot of space (players may have to run around the table simultaneously), and is, in the words of Christian, "More fun for the people watching the game than the people playing the game."  But it's a great game if you're in the mood for something silly.  [Note: my rating assumes you're in the mood for a game like this]

I almost crushed Chris when we rolled the die that said we had to run around the table.  He decided not to try since he had an egg between his legs, I thought he was blocking, and I shoved him aside.

A játék inkább mulatságos, mint szórakoztató, de a lényeg, hogy végigröhögjük az egészet. Szerintem a legjobb, ha családdal, vagy közeli barátokkal játsszuk, mert így a legmulatságosabb a másik szenvedése a tojások megtartásáért, miközben furábbnál furább pozíciókat vesz fel.
Azért vannak nála jobb ügyességi játékok. Nagyon korosztály függő, hogy ki hogy teljesít, hiszen fontos a jó reflex, a teljesen kifejlett végtagok :), és a kellő agilitás. Így lesz akit tuti nem lehet megverni benne, így ne is ez legyen a cél, hanem a jókedv! És hogy ez tuti megmaradjon, a játékhoz pakoljunk el mindent az asztalról és annak 2 méter sugarú köréből! Kár, hogy csak négyszemélyre elegendő tojás került a dobozba. Vagy kell venni még egy példányt, vagy ki kell próbálni "élesben" (mondjuk akkor a pattanós trükk nem ajánlott :P).

Essentially it is a physical game where people try to collect eggs and not drop them in order to score points. Great party game but be warned, physical injury is possible (nay likely). Great for those non-gamer friends and good to loosen up those stiff heavy gamers when they get too serious.

This one can be hilarious, and possibly a bit dangerous. One family gathering saw injuries to knee, hands, feet and fingers to various adult and teenage players. At school in a soft grassy yard this becomes a full contact sport. Roll the die, grab for the eggs and tuck them between chin, knees, neck, etc. The one with the most eggs wins.

Based on one play: Intended as a kids game but still fun as an adult. It is short and has very simple rules. You roll a die that triggers and event such as grab the die or run around the table and the winner has to hold an egg either between their legs, neck, chin, etc. Once someone drops an egg they are out and the one with the most eggs of the remaining players wins. Cute and most silly, but must be fun for children and we enjoyed it also.

Running around the table is a hoot when you have eggs stuffed out of everwhere... A must for adults who enjoy watching other adults act like kids!  Don't play with "serious" gamers who have no sense of fun.  They're missing something...

January 2015: This game hurts. Physically.

House rule (or perhaps I didn't read them carefully): ALL players must run around the table, even though there's no chance you'd be the first around because of all the eggs you're holding.

The least played of our Haba games. Needs a party environment rather than sitting around the kitchen table. I like the action dice, but my daughter and I both get tired of holding the eggs. We rarely get an entire game through. Funnily enough, played it with my tertiary students - the girls REALLY got into it, but the boys (usually VERY outgoing) clamed up and were ultra self-conscious about calling out "cock-a-doodle-doo"!.

A goofy, silly game that is one that will only come out when playing games with younger kids. I had fun doing it with them and they were having a lot of fun with it. You may have to yell things, run around the table, and definitely hold rubber/wooden eggs in funny ways (between knees, under chin, between cheek and shoulder, bend of elbow, armpit). Not hard all on its own, but try to do everything else you need to be doing in order to play the game and compete for more eggs.

For kids this is perfect...  watch that they don't get too rowdy as I can certainly see egg related injuries occuring.  Short, easy and extremely entertaining.

An interesting (and cute) take on mixing a party game with a form of quick recognition and speed game -- neither of which is a genre I particularly enjoy.  Still, I've enjoyed this game when I've played it, though only very late in the evening (and which earned me a post on youtube).  That being said, it does need a good group.  Were it not so late when I played, I would be the person most likely to not have a pleasant experience with this.  As such, I would be willing to play it again --  if late -- certainly not early in an evening of gaming. [02/17/2008]

Though there are moments of laughs and silliness, Dancing Eggs is not the best game: there are few, if any, moments of strategy (or even dexterity). Still, it is hard to hate a game that almost guarentees laughs and Dancing Eggs does this.

I struggle with the competitive aspect of running around the table.  My new idea which could bump up the rating is to play in such a way as to allow all players to run 5 to 10 feet directly behind them, then come back to the table.  There's just not enough room running around a table to be "fast."

Damn, this game is so darn silly and cute I had to have it.

Players roll a die to determine how an egg is distributed. Another die is then rolled to determine where the distributed egg is placed (under the chin, between the legs, etc).

It's a great looking party game and it was well worth the price just to see my mum scream and laugh as she pounced on the egg bouncing past her!

Don't play with gamers who take things too seriously.

Fun silly dexterity game. Roll the die, do what it says (bounce an egg and everyone races to catch it; race around the table; "cockadoodledoo!"; etc.) to claim an egg. Roll a different die to figure out where to hold it (in the crook of your elbow, under your chin, etc.). Keep playing until someone drops one of their eggs; everyone ELSE scores 1 VP per egg they have (or 2VP for the wooden egg). Most points wins.

Light and silly and fun!

Etta (1 1/2) likes the big chunky dice and the rubber eggs that bounce, she has a pretty good throw for her age so I think it's best to keep the wooden one out of range to avoid breaking things. I know that the paper egg carton goes with the theme, but it would have been nice to have a more robust container.

UPDATE: purchased newest version that comes in a durable box, not Yardmaster durable, but much more then the egg box from the first copy we had.

Ridiculous(ly great) children's/party game. Alas, doesn't work at all with players who aren't willing to make fools of themselves, which is most of the people I know.

RATING: 6
[HABA 2003 edition] {Kid; action, dice-rolling; optimal 4p} Dancing Eggs is a silly fun party game; esp. for children.  One should take photos when playing this game. Sadly, this game is more suitable for a large party but the components of a single box can only support up to 4 players.  Therefore, 2 copies are needed.

The component is stunning. The plastic eggs and wooden eggs look like real! I like the 2 BIG dice very much. The illustration on the 2 dice is so cute.

This is another game that my daughter and her friends loved when they were young. I thought it was kind of idiotic, but I bought it for her and she loved it so--mission accomplished. It's best to have a table you can run around without crashing into things, and just skip the chairs.

Personal rating. My oldest daughter thinks this is quite fun, but maybe holding more than two eggs becomes unwieldy too quickly - are the eggs a bit too heavy?

This is a hilariously fun game that has some dice rolling and some physical humor thrown in.  There's even some risk management, as you have to decide whether or not to take the slippery egg that is worth more points.  I've had lots of fun with this with kids and adults.

A great party game but it needs a clear table and enough space to run around it. In case the space is too small we house rule the running rule into first player to touch the table with their forehead wins. The player who threw the die can not compete and is judge.

This is the only game that can teach you how hard it is to keep a rubber egg jammed underneath your chin while having laughing fits.

Fun, silly game of collecting eggs and storing them on your body (between chin and chest, under your arm, between your legs, etc.). First person to drop an egg loses the game. Of the remaining people, whoever has the most eggs wins the game!

Hard to find people who want to play due to the style of game that it is, but when I do it's a lot of fun, seeing someone make a huge effort to catch a bounced egg and then dropping the other 2 they were carrying is all kinds of hilarious.

Players take turns grabbing eggs off the table and holding them on various parts of their body.  There is potential for fun, but the win condition of "first to drop an egg" is too easy to avoid with the low number of eggs causing the game to just go on and on.

the run-around-the-table option somewhat limits the options for when/where to play, but is the kind of game where you play Day #1 until you burn it out and then is fun for an occasional round or two.

Comments pertain only to adults playing this game with no kids actively playing. I was carrying my four month old daughter, so it may not count. 

  Another party/dexterity game with players running around trying to grab eggs and holding them using different body part. Not a bad game by any means, but probably will overstay welcome with adults at some point. Now, if there are kids in the mixture, it may not be nearly as bad. But I figure with younger kids, adults have to be less aggressive and not compete as much since adults still have an advantage (running around the table or grabbing a bouncing egg). Still, a worthy HABA game in the collection.

OK, this game is the sort of party game that I can get in to.  Any dexterity game that states in the rules that whoever drops the die is responsible for picking it up gets my approval.  Sure, it's for kids, but this is also the sort of game you could combine with alcohol to have a rollicking good time ... or at least a fraternity game.

A few too few eggs (I guess buy two sets?), but really nails what it sets out to do.  Silly, hilarious fun with the kids, and easy enough for them to play unassisted.  Rating kids only, of course: adults play this?

Also, the egg carton is quite fragile, so keep an eye out for rough treatment from your kids.

This Egg-dancing game comes with a carton of rubber eggs and 2 special 6-sided dice.  The first die specifies fun activities, and the second specifies how winning players have to hold a rubber egg.  This game causes a lot of laughter, particularly when players with eggs between their knees run around the table.  Whoever can hold on to the most eggs wins.

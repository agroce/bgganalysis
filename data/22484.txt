An easy-to-learn abstract strategy game with colorful tiles.

Recommended with 2 players (best 2). 30 mins.

RATING: 9
This travel edition is a two-player version, you won't be able to play it with more, but you certainly can play it solo, just like the other version. I don't know why they didn't point that out in the box, but as far as solitaire play, it's the same game. 

I play Ingenious as often as I can, online, on my iPhone, live, solo, you name it! This game grew on me very quickly and today I consider it one of my favorite abstract strategy games! Always up for a game! Want to play? 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Still Ingenious, but a bit too small, and I HATE the scoring track -- hard to quickly compare the advancements.  Bolder numbers and a little gray shading past halfway would go far here.  Sliders would also improve on the whole pegs thing.

Not the quality pieces of the the normal version but still the same good game by Dr. Knizia. I prefer the big box with the plastic pieces to be honest but being in a smaller box helps getting with you everywhere or saves some storage space for those who calculate those things.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.1
I've played Ingenious and thought it was a bit dry.  I actually prefer the travel edition because it's the same game for two and it takes about as much space as this game deserves.  And it still comes with Knizia's unique scoring system.

This game is growing on me and is quite satisfying for a game that last only 15 minutes.  Maybe if I spent more time on it, I would actually win.

i'm not completely sure if, like many other games, i'd rather play ingenious with two.  i still like it that way, though.  the box is a great size.  i took a sharpie to the numbers on the scoring track to highlight them, which worked well.  i don't have a problem with the scoring pegs, although i agree that a fixed slider would have been superior.  doesn't seem great for play while travelling, but once you're at your destination i'm sure you'd appreciate the box and weight.

I really like Ingenious.  But the Travel Edition (or, 2-player edition) gets lower marks because it's just too small.  The pieces are tiny and the pegs for keeping score are just impossibly small for my fingers (which are not exactly fat).  It does get bonus points for having a grid to place your pieces in so they don't move around.  I wish the regular edition had this feature.

Honey, they shrunk the game ! Yes, the 2-player version has been reduced to a size that would make it the bees knees for ants with magnifying glasses, but nothing makes you realize just how small the average train, pub, or restaurant table is these days until you start unfolding the standard sized board over it. So having it all fit inside a standard 2-player kosmos box is simply delightful. Space or location is no longer an issue, since it easily fits on your lap. Movement disturbance too has been successfully tackled. Roads and rail will have to be in serious disrepair before the raised ridges will release the played tiles, or the scoring pins an hand-tiles will jump out of their slots. People with large hands might find the compact components a bit fiddly, especially moving the scoring pins can present a dexterity test, but to us it couldn't have been more perfect. It looks like our Lost Cities has just gained a permanent travel companion. And I can even see it being a welcome diversion when I have to travel solo, as the 1-player variation usually keeps me well entertained too.

Game is basically original Genial but with two players and a two player board and while I like Genial I also liked Genial Travel Edition.

MINI VERSION. A good miniaturized version of Ingenious.  I love the original, but it was always too bulky to take anywhere.  I can see this become a frequently played two player.  The pieces are small but still very functional.  The box size is great for travel.  Thumbs Up!

I have to rate this lower as the original Ingenious, simply because it only plays 2. I don't see the point in owning this, though the box is a bit smaller if that's of any concern. Actually, it is to me, but I would much rather own the bigger box which can be played with 4 players. The tile distribution is a bit different in this edition. Ingenious isn't really my cup of tea, so thhis gets a "meh".

Dedicated 2 player travel edition of Einfach Genial - greatly shrunk down, with recessed spaces for the tiles and scoring markers.  Players alternate playing domino-like double-hexagon tiles onto a playing area.  Each tile contains one or two symbols which score points for lines of matching symbols off the five open hexsides at each end of the tile.  There are six different symbols to worry about.  Final score is the points earned in the lowest symbol and highest "lowest" wins.  Excellent game that doesn't tax the brain too much due to limited hand size and very clear board layout.

The downside are those tiny little scoring pegs. Otherwise I really enjoy this game and I love the plastic despite it only being playable by two people. This is another one of my honeymoon games used to distract my plane disliking wife as we flew off after our wedding.

I thought there is a compartment to store the pieces underneath the board, but there wasn't. At least they included a cloth bag to store the pieces.

All bits including board are made from plastic, so they're good during traveling.

After 2 plays:
The game is too small IMO, but I think we'll appreciate the size more when we're traveling.
I bought this game especially to play with my mom but she said there's not much strategy, she simply dump the pieces in. Probably that's why she lost both rounds against me.

Puzzle game that reminds me of the count in cribbage. This is the archetypal Knizia game, so much that it has been reduced to colors and counting. Interestingly enough though, I can't think of a Knizia game that has a bigger luck factor. No matter how clever you play your pieces, if you only draw a trace amount of one color (which has happened to me), you will lose. 

Another gripe I have about this game is that sometimes the ending is seen a mile away.

I only played the 2-player travel edition, so perhaps the big boy game offers something more.  Overall, I think I just find this boring.  Simple mathematical fare where no exciting momentum shifts or clever moves seem to interrupt the droning chunk of tile placement.  The multi-tracked race of the scoring pawns should be more exciting than it is, but the reaction at the end seems to always be "oh, I guess I won" "good game"  "again?"  "no, I've got to get going".  Fine, but not something I'd look forward to.

It's Ingenious for two! There isn't much to say about this game that's different from the original, which I love. The fact that it's limited to two players lowers my rating to an 8, but it's very convenient to carry around. Just don't lose the scoring pieces!

We own the Einfach Genial Reiseedition (Ingenious Travel Edition) which is for 2 players only. The first few games I played I tended to refer to it as 'Qin Lite'. In fact, I'm finding that there is a little more strategy than in Qin. It is possible to place your tiles at different angles to cut off your opponent, and it is easier to block in this game whereas blocking in Qin is quite rare. You want to advance your own score pegs, but also hinder your opponent from scoring their lowest color. You have to be lucky to draw tiles you need, but you are also allowed to swap your hand of tiles if you have no matches in your lowest scoring colour. The plastic board is light and sturdy, the small tiles are cute, but the tiny pegs are not meant for big fingers. I can see playing this on a plane, but man! if you drop one of those tiny pegs you are not likely to find it again! Initially I had this up for trade, but now I'm thinking its...

Have played the copy I bought for friend. Its a good time filler. I just prefer a bit of flavor.

RATING: 7
Identical to the full board version in gameplay, except the board is just big enough for two players and the tiles won't slide once placed.  And since everything is plastic, it's immune to ice cream and other such things.

The scoring pegs fit a little bit loosely, but deep enough that it shouldn't matter (with the sole exception of the purple holes at zero in the corners).  The tile holding slots work well.

I figured out a simple variant to handicap myself when playing my son -- I always pick the tile I'm going to play at random.  I make the best move I can with it, but it's random.  I suppose I should just play by drawing from the bag, it would be simpler.

I like how the tiles stay in place and it's nice and small.  However, the tiny scoring pegs bug me.  Still, it's the same old Ingenious: the first third of the game seems boring, like you're just filling in space and then it gets good as things tighten up.

Very well produced 2-player version of Ingenious, perfect for playing in bed.  :)  Ingenious has really grown on me.  I started off fairly lukewarm on it, but it has proven to be more strategic than I originally gave it credit for.  I like the 2-player version better than its predecessor, as there is less downtime and more control.

Fun game (played two games with a friend over lunch at a Chinese restaurant), but I like the full size version better.  Same opinion again on 5-8-2010.  Full size version with four players is *alot* more fun than travel version with two players.  But if space is a problem, play the travel version.

I really enjoy the original Ingenious, but always wished for a more secure board and scoring system.  Well, this is it!  Yes, the bits are extremely small, and it's only for 2 players, but the board is perfectly portable and not mess-up-able.  This game will be on the table with me in many a coffee shop!

Jogo abstrato onde devemos colocar peças no formato de dois hexágonos grudados. Cada uma com um círculo colorido no centro de cada hexágono. Ao se colocar as peças no tabuleiro se ela encostar em outras peças com círculos da mesma cor você pontua nessa cor. É importante ter uma pontuação equilibrada entre as cores pois você  vence, ou perde, pela pontuação da cor que você tem menos ponto. Genial. Recomendo! A versão travel para duas pessoas é super prática, bem acabada e portátil.

Good:  It's Mensa Connections.  It's 2-player only.  The tiles slot onto the board, with indentations for your rack and slot-in scoring pegs.
Bad:  Those pegs are difficult to read.  Biggest baddie of all - they changed the tile distribution and wrecked the game, helping out the weaker player in the endgame.

A great 2 player abstract strategy game. Some complaints is that it can get too samey, but I still enjoy this quite a lot. I really dislike the tiny little score markers however, but I understand why they are there.

A great, quite simple and colourful abstract from Reiner Knizia.  Quick and easy to play, this game offers enough of a challenge, while keeping the AP factor down.  There's more to this game than meets the eye, and the way you play the beginning of the game is quite different from the endgame.  Once the players have figured out how to play a balanced game of capitalizing and blocking, Ingenious really shines!

Initial Rating: 6

Pros:
* Takes up less space in the game closet
* Pieces connect to the board perfectly and don't slide around.

Cons:
* Scoring pins are too small and prone to being dropped.
* Limited to 2 players.

I like the board design that lets the pieces stick to the board. The only problem is that I now get disappointed every time we pull out the regular version and I realize that the pieces don't connect to the board. 
I like the original game better since I very much prefer the 4-player partnership rules to the 2-player game. But this travel edition is still very nice.

Played 10+ Play with my partner and she enjoys this which is great by me. If we are to get serious then we will need to start playing mean which might not work for us. I'll let you know. I have noticed that the only moves that really matter are your last couple of placements the rest of the game you can really play on autopilot. *UPDATE* 5 plays in and still going strong. My partner likes it, yes the last couple of turns can get mildly "nasty" but nothing to make us fall out with each other. It is small enough to play this version in bed. March 10

It is what it is: you place tiles with different color combinations on a board, trying to maximize your victory points. Lots of luck in tile drawing, obviously.

RATING: 7.25
Ingenious is an interesting game with some nice balance points.  Most often the game revolves around placing a tile for points, or placing it for effect on your opponent(s) scoring chances, though some plays can do both.  It incorporates the lowest scoring total = player's score concept from T&E with a double hex tile laying/area connection concept similar in some ways to Continuo.

It can become more chaotic with more players, but is still quite enjoyable; with two it is a careful game of planning, deliberation and of course the luck of your draws.


Ingenious makes a decent solitaire, but without a lot of differentiation between games. My best scores typically are around the 18pt break, or a little lower.  Still it plays very quickly, and because of the random tile pull it is always different in the way it plays out.

Picked this up and took it back immediately.  For a travel edition, it's not terribly travel friendly.  It's small, but it needs to be stored in the original box instead of being self-contained.  But most of all, the scoring pegs are TINY and do not "stick" in the holes at all.  These pegs will be lost almost immediately since you can't leave them in the holes for travel, but have to put them in and take them out during setup and cleanup.  If the board had sliders on it, or ANYTHING other than pegs that almost require tweezers to move, I would have kept it, forgiving all the other faults.

Apr08:  I really enjoyed this small travel edition of Ingenious.  It looks like they were serious about making this work in the car or on the plane.

The game play remains just as good.  It's an enjoyable abstract where every move is an incremental increase in your score.  Still, it has interesting decisions and the ability to plan and mitigate risk.  Quite nice.

I like this more than Ingenious. There are two reasons for that: first, if I'm with more than one other person, I'd never play Ingenious, so no need to buy the more expensive game just for that. But, mostly, the portability of this game makes it a whole lot better. I'd never pick this game to play in my living room, but if I have to bring something over, this is good entertainment.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (April 2014)

Gorgeous edition of the game. Great and cute components (except for the loose pegs and the abysmal scoring numbers that are invisible). I like Ingenious more as a 2 player game (in general I prefer abstracts games to be 2 player only), however I never liked it very much due to the luck of the draw. It is weird that an abstract game (with zero theme) has so much luck. On the good side, it plays fairly quickly.

Bottom line, I’m still not sure of Ingenious in general. I will play it more in the coming months to form a better opinion but most likely I will sell my copy of the game. I still prefer the travel edition over the big one though.

The lock-in tiles are wonderful--I wish the parent game had that production. The scoring pegs are too small, but I can live with it. I wish they hadn't limited this to only 2-player, though in fairness that's almost always how I play the game.

Yeah. I don't like Ingenious, masquerading as an abstract. And so, I don't like this either, but I might as well give them the same rating. If I'm going to have to play a game like this, it would be preferable with two, and the travel version is nicely put together, but my rating for the regular Ingenious is already based on the best possible option, which is two-player.

A fantastic travel game.

Play on the beach or by the pool.

The solitaire variant works great for this one too (Really could  have included those in the rules).

The pieces are plastic so are great for non boardgame like environments.

Take good care of the pegs (in a baggie) and the pieces so this one can accompany you on your travels.

RATING: 6.5
By 'ecky-thump, that Mr Knizia is a clever bloke. Where Knights Of Charlemagne and Palazzo missed, Ingenious has been a resounding hit, proving that abstract is the way to go. I was a little wary of this at first because it struck me as a bit too Deep Thought and chess-like. But, as it turns out, it can be pretty much as light or as heavy as you want to make it. Easily playable in twenty minutes; well given to vindictiveness and mutual backslapping in equal parts. A gripe about the quality of the parts (particularly that hideous board) is all that's keeping this from something bigger and better.

Одна из лучших абстрактных игр, которые попадали к нам в руки. Похожа на филлер, но благодаря неплохим встроенным стратегическим элементам играть очень интересно. Интересна идея определять победителя по отстающим цветовым элементам - это прибавляет игре азарта. она становится похожа на Race. Таким образом: три игры в одной. И нам она нравится больше, чем Блокус.

Portability is good as tiles sit well in both the recesses and on the board which is an ideal size for play and throwing in a travel bag. 

Yet I feel the production should have made the numbers on the scoring track black to assist in the points scored. Also would have liked the scoring track alittle wider (to make the pegs easier to move) and on either side of the board (to ease in comparing scores). 

An interesting abstract in terms of increasing and smothering scoring opportunities. Generally I don't like themeless abstracts, however at least in Ingenious the tiles held are secret and the random draws from the bag create a tense dependency; the real joy is the scoring conditions which create swings in status and is an ideal stepping stone to the better implementation in Euphrat and Tigris.

RATING: N/A
I'm not sure I'd call this an abstract, but only because I side with the pedantic crowd on this one: I generally find I reserve the term "Abstract" to refer to no-luck, combinatorial games. I much prefer calling things like Ingenious "themeless" games, since it's a bit more tactical and plays a bit like a card game (you have a "hand" of 6 tiles) and it's pretty tactical. Since at the time of this writing I have 21 plays of this game, please understand that's not an indictment, just that I categorize things in my mind a bit differently than most folks (such as who compile stats on the Abstract Subdomain, for example). 

Anyway. This is fun. It's a themeless card game with tiles instead of cards, and you basically play your tiles into a central area where you fight for position in multiple colors at once. In typical Knizia fashion, your final score is your weakest color, so you have to balance strengths and weaknesses throughout. I find this game much clearer than Tigris & Euphrates, and there are a lot of similarities between the two. I like Ingenious quite a bit. 

I'll note that a great majority of these games were played against my wife after we collapsed into bed and this was our nightcap. Such is the attraction of Travel versions of some games. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I love travel sized games!

That said, I wish sliders or some other mechanism other than tiny pegs were used for scoring; they seem way too easy to lose.

Still, I think I prefer Backgammon over this (when comparing abstract strategy games with a huge does of luck -- a genre I really like). I wish there were more long-term strategy in this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Man! I heard it was small but it is really small.  One of the score pegs got lost on first day.  Great for trips and playing on couch/ in bed- just make sure to get score sheet off downloads.

UPDATE: Found peg in laundry room... yipeee!

Love it, love it, love it.
Very simple rules, fast but clever gameplay, "I want to try again" factor... "Ingenious" has everything I adore in abstract games. More interesting than "Qwirkle" (which I also very much enjoy!) but with similar rules complexity. Teach it in about three minutes and you can play, even with complete newbies. There's some luck involved, but more often than not it's about outsmarting your opponent, not about getting the right tiles. 

Very smart game and the tension rises with each move. Did I already say I love it?

Ingenious is delightfully fun.  It's also a very interactive game with a really neat scoring system.  Because the color that you score the lowest in is you actual score, each player is forced to diversify his/her actions.  Neglecting one color and saying, "I'll get back to it later," is very dangerous because once many pieces have been played, it can be difficult to find enough pieces of that color to build a large  enough chain to catch up with the pieces you have.  It's a game of blocking, balance and timing.  It also simultaneously rewards and penalizes aggressive play, which I find rather neat.

A simple concept made challenging by the interesting scoring mechanism (your score is that of your lowest-scored color), and by the opportunities for more offensive play toward the end of the game.

Prefer this to regular Ingenious, since the scale matches the luck a bit better, and 2P just feels more appropriate for an abstract. The tiny pegs haven't bothered me thus far, but my girlfriend has managed to lose them on both the plane and the train. After much rummaging under seats they were recovered, but we're afraid to play it while travelling now...

Update: still getting regular play at our place. Has staying power.

RATING: 8
nice little abstract that only takes a minute to teach. like with other Knizia's, your score is the lowest of your colors. this clever scoring really makes the game. you need to interfere with your opponent's plans, or else this game just comes down to luck of the draw (literally, what colors you draw). i love the beautiful patterns that are revealed during play

Smaller box 2p-only version of Ingenious. The scoring pegs are a bit fiddly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's the basic game, but tinified -- so cute! The one problem with this version is that the scoring track might be a bit difficult to use: the pins are small and easy to drop, and the numbers are hard to read (blend into the background too much) -- at least on the German version.

Not so good because of the tile distribution. But, when you need a dose of Ingenious and you happen to be on a six hour boat trip - this is the best you can get on a small Jadrolinija ferry table.

Probably my wifes favourite game, along with Dominion. I really enjoy this too. I reckon we've clocked in atleast 70 games. Great to take travelling with us. It's quick and has that "just one more" compulsion.

Ingenious is a great game and this is a solid version.  I love how the tiles lock onto the board.  I don't love the scoring pegs as they are a bit tedious to use.

If you love Ingenious and want something that's more portable, this is a good choice although it's only a 2-player game.

The box is a lot lighter than I expected it to be and super easy to carry around or just stick in a bag or purse just in case :) Perfect for Ingenious on the go!

RATING: 8
Nice to have a board the pieces lock into -- no accidental bumps and pieces sliding around like the full size version. The only problem I have with this is the scoring pegs are hard to manipulate. I end up grabbing two or bumping one and then I have to remember what my score was in that color.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The small and compact board is what leads to the "travel edition" label, but the similarly small and compact pieces are a serious argument *against* playing it while travelling.  A good way to lose pieces I imagine, but not a good way to play a deep thought-invoking game like this.  This small version has had great success as a household game.  You know, here in my house.

Quick but very addictive game. The score tracking is always up to date which helps to avoid AP and helps planning moves. Initial rating 8.

Cons: Abstract
Only plays 2
Components a bit too small

Conclusion: Ingenious: Travel Edition is a great 2-player abstract with approachable bits.  This was nice to bring along on a plane or train ride.  The play is simple enough not to feel that you have invested a chunk of time in it.  I'm now curious about the regular version.

RATING: 7
Other than the too-small scoring pegs, this two-player travel edtion of Ingenious is practical, nice-looking and as fun for two as the original is for three or four players. A definite winner.

The pegs are too small, but other than that, this travel edition is awesome.

RATING: 8
I will always play with this edition over the standard edition as a 2-player game. Same rating. The main advantage is that setup/teardown time is shorter and less fiddly with the Travel Edition. The main drawback is that the numbers on the scoring track can be hard to see in low light conditions.

27-DEC-2012: Upgraded to 8.

This is another great partner game. My wife and I probably play this the most because it is compact, light, easy to set up and doesn't take that long to play. It is very strategic but gives you that same feeling you get when you play someone in tetris. Genius.

A solid and good abstract game that plays somewhat fast. Being only a two player it loses its attraction for me a bit.

Abstracts are not my thing, so have that in mind. A 6.5 for an abstract, could e translated for a 8 for a thematic game.

RATING: 6
I like that the tiles are held in place on this board, as opposed to the bigger version where they can be easily disturbed. The scoring pegs are rather small and fiddly though. I can see them getting lost easily if dropped in certain locations (such as outdoors), but it is not all that difficult to look after them. This is a game for two that really can be played anywhere, as it has a very low (and fixed) space requirement.

RATING: 6
If you already own Ingenious, there's no reason to buy this one unless you plan to do a lot of traveling and want the same good game in a highly portable edition. If you are interested in Ingenious, I still think I would promote the basic game, if only because it goes up to four players. Even if you will likely play two-player games only, I still think I would recommend the original game, unless money or size is an issue. At the same time, travelers will love Ingenious, as it takes a good abstract game and makes it easy to setup and play. See my mini-review for more details...

Ingenious is delightfully nasty as a two-player duel while still appealing to the non-confrontational crowd, and this provides that in a compact, portable format. What's not to like?

A game given to by my friend Frank Eisenhauer, it doesn't play as fun as the original but still makes for a challenging game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
It keeps the same rating because what it loses in complexity (no runs of a color due to smaller distribution), it gains in portability. I usually only play regular 2-player too, so that loss of functionality doesn't matter as much.

RATING: 7
I play the iPhone app of this a lot.  I would rate that higher.  I have not played the boardgame but think that counting of the scoring might get a bit bothersome (iPhone does automatically).

The twist here is that you don't want to score the highest points, but have your lowest score be higher than your opponent.  Takes a couple of plays to get out of the conventional mindset of scoring a lot of points.

Knizia; 2 player Kosmos; The game is played on a hex board. 57 equally sized pieces, each consisting of two joined hexes come with the game. There are symbols on each hex that makes up the piece (sometimes identical symbols). The pieces are drawn randomly in the game. Each player receives six pieces to start the game, which are placed onto a rack and visible to them alone.

English: Add more if you play game with "Shadow of Omega" with the use of arcane characters and many more cards. The illustrations are still precious, you can play without "Shadow of Omega".

Español: Añade más juego si lo unes a "Sombra de Omega" junto con el uso de personajes Arcanos y muchas más cartas. Las ilustraciones siguen siendo preciosas, se puede jugar sin "Sombra de Omega".

Rich theme and nice art. Would have been stronger if it had been entirely co-op... the pseudo competitive nature makes the game too easy to undermine a player in the 11th hour.

RATING: 9
Excellent game. At its best when played with 3-5 players. Even better when combined with one or both expansions. Arcane characters really add to gameplay. Add a couple of optional rules (exploding dice!) and no fight can be taken for granted.

RATING: 2
The art is AMAZING and that's what saves it from me rating it a 1. It's barely a game. You throw a d6 and hope for the best while everyone slows each other down and the game drags on. Shadow of Omega tried to fix the draggy endgame but it's not enough. The cards drip with theme but the mechanics of the game kill any sense of immersion into the wonderful anime universe they tried to create.

You need to combine both games Anima: Shadow of Omega and this. Otherwise you won't have enough cards to play properly.

It was one of the first games I bought when I got into the hobby and I found it very interesting, refreshing and fun. As soon as I played more games and tried different mechanincs it started to feel a bit dull compared to other games. The randomness might also make your objective imposible or very hard to achieve.

The expansion added more of the same as the base set which adds to replayability but fails to enhance the game experience.

The best RPG adventure card game system.

Beyond Good and Evil is the first expansion of the Anima card game and the title of the game actually comes from Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche's book.  So you can see the game designer's ambition of creating the world and the games revolving around this fantasy world setting. The gameplay is competitive on one level and cooperative on another - yes, very "zen". The artwork and the character concepts worth the price alone. This expansion adds new class of characters to the game and the base game is still intact.  You expand your team by recruitment, visit the locations and get to explore them, defeat the monsters and get your reward!  It's that simple and collect all RPG elements nicely so, and in card game format!  No other card game can beat it.  A highly and hearty recommended card adventure game from a wargamer like me.  It is a very richly detailed card game in which many fascinating tales to tell.

Light party gathering, dungeon-crawling, adventuring, rpg ...thing.  It has a lot of text to read, and some of the monsters are a little unbalanced.  The art ranges from very good to cheesey to a little embarrassing to play in mixed company.  If you are an anime fan and are looking for light fun, this might scratch that itch.

Nice game, i love the feeling of the adventure.
Best with all 3 modules.

It's flaws, so randomness on the game that it sometimes feels like you aren't even playing.

This game has serious balancing issue. Players who fall behind will rarely have the chance to catch up again, making those said players feeling the urge to end the game faster thus creating a "Munchkin" type of play.

OMFG. Most disappointing purchase ever.

This is a terrible game. A TERRIBLE GAME. Do NOT attempt to play this game stand-alone. If there is ANY way that this thing works, it's in combination with the original box, because the maths in this thing are broken.

It's basically rolling two dice for a 1 in 6 chance of winning combat for the first 20 turns or so, until someone gets lucky and actually beats something, at which point they get marginally better.

This game can go on like this for HOURS.... a complete waste of time.

Pity. Because the art is magnificent and the concept was great.

Bah.

Juego que recrea una aventura épica en la que al menos trendrás que cumplir una de las dos misiones menores particulares de cada jugador, para aumentar tu poder y tu grupo de héroes, antes de acometer la misión final, que es común para todos. Todos los Anima son independientes para jugar y también se pueden mezclar entre ellos para una experiencia mayor.

This game is best described as [I]Final Fantasy The Card Game[/I]. The artwork is great. As a stand alone game it could definitely use more cards. You will cycle through them more than once during a game. You do however have the option to add the cards from the two other games in the series (I play this combined with both [thing=24935][/thing] and [thing=63385][/thing]). The game is probably best with four players, but I think it would take too long to finish for me to enjoy it. I will keep the game in my collection to play as a two player game. The linen cardstock is great. Plays are logged under [thing=24935][/thing].

Everything ended. Omega, the ancient entity that threatened to disrupt all life in Gaïa, is sealed. Its unlimited source of power, the Infinity Orb, has been shattered, and the splinters scattered. Humanity continued forward, confident that this grave danger has past... or has it?
\13\\13\
Anima: Beyond Good and Evil is the first stand-alone expansion for Anima: Shadow of Omega. You take control of a party of exceptional characters, wielding their cunning and magical powers to complete missions and ultimately stop the ultimate evil, Genesis. Be warned, however, other players will hinder your actions in order to claim victory for themselves.
\13\\13\
Anima: Beyond Good and Evil continues the adventures in Gaïa for 2-4 players, playable in about an hour. Beyond Good and Evil can be played as an independent game, or it can be combined with Anima: Shadow of Omega

Essentially the same as Shadow of Omega with the minor improvements being balanced against inferior art.

According to the box the game plays 2-5, however, this is not possible with the components provided.

The new encounters are also much more punishing and random. Very disappointing.

130929 Unfortunately over the past year I'm starting to feel this game is a bit long for what it is.

120910 As I play it a few more times, I really have to say I'm getting into the zone for these crayon rail games.  They aren't gonna be intense brain burners but they are a very pleasant way to burn some time.  That said, Chinese city names are hard to differentiate and remember!

120617 great way to learn chinese geography, can't say its amazing...though that's more about the crayon rail system in general.

If your geographical knowledge of China is good, then game is good (although components could still be easier to recognize). Else, stay away. This is more learning geography than playing. With European map this would work.

     China Rails is a nice add on to the Empire Builder Series.   It has some excellent event cards giving the game a unique flavor.  The geography and city names are a challenge, even with the player aids.

Connect the mainland cities. Get a profitable East-West line going. Avoid tapping into Taiwan until going for the win.

It's a tough map.    I like the Taiwan container delivery mechanism.  When and if you do a long East-West route can have a big influence on your game... that said, you still need to be lucky with card draws.

No thanks.  Why build west?  Yes, the loads are big, but it takes sooo much time and money.  The activity is all in the east part of the map, less than half.  Plus, there's nothing new here, game-wise.  Just a new map.  Pass.

Like a combination of Merchant of Venus and Rail Baron, but not quite as good as either.  Crayons are annoying.  Chinese geography is annoying, and makes for a long game.  Like Rail Baron, you need to maximize the number of players to make the game interesting and competitive, but like Merchant of Venus, really slows down with more players.

I enjoy all the crayon rails games.  China Rails is quick (because of the big payouts) but has a substantial luck element.  If the Party Congress comes up just at the right time, you could be in big trouble.  But even so, it's short enough that you can always set it up again and start another game.

Before laying out the puzzle mapboard (honestly, this is the 21st century, please update your production methods...), I had precious little knowledge of Chinese geography.  Game is consistent with other crayon games; it's a quasi multi-solitaire race to the finish with little if any player interaction.

This version of the Empire Building series is a lot of fun. In the new version of the game Mayfair has provided a grid right on the gameboard with coordinates in the manual for every city and load listed alphabetically. Learning how to get around on the map to find the loads can take time, so I'd put this version at a little longer than the 240mins that Mayfair states. The desert is dicey (long east-west route) and has the possibility to wash out completely. Risky business. We always have fun starting off at the slowest speeds. My wife never upgrades her train which is funny because she almost always wins.

Yay, China Rails! This is a pretty difficult map; there are some areas that I just wanted to avoid.  Fortunately, there aren't any major cities out there, so it's perfectly reasonable to avoid them (unless you want to, like, make lucrative deliveries or something. Heh.). I like the geographical variety it presents. Lack of familiarity with Chinese geography did make it take longer. (1 play)

Some claim this map is broken due to the east-west payoffs.  I'm not sure I agree; I've won with a north-south strategy before, but that could be because my opponents were weaker tactically.  An entertaining map to play.

Mayfair should be ashamed to release a game at this price point ($45 in UK) in 2007.  Component quality is shocking (very flimsy box, rulebook looks like a photocopy, plastic pieces have flash, board pieces arrived warped) and art is practically non-existent, just a lot of black and white stuff.  Goods tiles are very hard to read.  Paper money horribly generic with art not relevant to the game.  It's like playing a game on black and white TV.

Game appears to be quite good though.

I had read that establishing a route to the west is the path to victory in this game, but I just didn't believe it. But then I won a game doing just that, unintentionally. I just followed my loads, which led me a little further west trip after trip until I reached the far side. Then it was just a matter of loading up on rugs and flushing the cards till I got high-paying deliveries. I enjoyed that game, but I am not entirely sure how it will play out in the long haul.

I usually prefer the crayon rail games that have a significant twist or plays very differently than just changing the map.  This was okay but the western half of China lacks major cities and b/c of the length of territory to cover, I'm not sure it is as efficient as the eastern half of the city (one of the optimal strategies is to use a north/south network in the east).

Solid crayon rails game. Just as good as any other, I suppose, but the Chinese geography adds a bit to the play time. Also, the play is quite focused on the eastern shore – I'm not sure if it ever makes sense to wander to the western deserts.

So probably I'd just rather play EuroRails.

As British rails. Its good game, pick-up-and-delivery with something more thrown in. Would wanna try it with fewer than 4 players. It seemed to have this mid-game where nothing happened and game didn't seem to go further. Think I liked UK map better.

Just received and looking forward to playing.

Jigsaw map.  Map has elements of Australia Rails (dry river beds and such) and Russia Rails (Communism).  Map is wide open and looks like it will play well.

Order of ranking for me: Euro, British, North American, Iron Dragon, Martian, Russian, China, Australian,  Nippon, India, and Lunar.

RATING: 6
Probably the most aggravating of the crayon rails games.  You can get big money in the west, but if the Party Congress card comes out, you have to drop everything and head back east, to a major city.  If this card never comes out, though, it's a decent game, and my rating may hit a 7, possibly an 8.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This Empire Builder (crayon rail) game features 5 major cities (all of which you must connect) in the southeast section of the map, while many of the large-value runs take you back and forth between the east and the northwest corner.  Despite the lack of Eurorails-style large bodies of water, I found the geography to be varied and interesting.  One downer for me in this game is the "Party Congress" card, which forces you to go to a major city--in most games this wouldn't be a problem, but since all the major cities are in the east, someone is bound to get majorly screwed.

On a par with the others in the series. This one seems to be rated somewhat lower than most of the others, but I can only guess that that is because its geography is less well known, and its city names more exotic and harder to hold in mind, for a western audience. We enjoyed it.

I originally was not all that impressed with this game.  However, the more I play it, the more I like it.  As an aside, I will state that I really dislike many of the event cards in this game.  That doesn't much matter as we don't play with them anyway.  At any rate, when this was first released, there were posts proclaiming that only those who went west won or only those who stayed in the east won.  Clearly both of these cannot be true and, in my experience, neither are.

Supposedly, some of the far west loads were given a little boost in value to otherwise get people to travel in that direction.  This seems to have worked out as in the handful of games we have played so far (five total), there is no region of the board that has not been built to.  And so far, it doesn't seem to give an advantage to anyone.  This deserves high praise given the problems with high payouts that are present in both Australian and Nippon Rails and the tendency swing the game more with luck of the draw than efficient track building and usage.

It helps that the map is rather interesting, with some varied terrain.  Granted, we still have trouble with many of the placenames, but not nearly the trouble we have with Nippon Rails.  All in all, an excellent addition to the system, particularly following the poor example that was Russian Rails. [05/24/2009]

1 play, 3er, public locking and fast-game variants ($60, 12/2 trains to start)

Another nice version of the crayon-rail system. Obviously, it's a different setting. Other key changes:
- Taiwan connection required; done by connecting to one of several ports
- must connect to all 4 mainland cities, all of which are on the eastern side
- many very high-value ($50+) deliveries possible, but you have to go to the wasteland out west (no major cities at all)

We typically take the events out, so can't comment on those.

[1 play] Initial reaction rating.  To be honest the game did get cut short so you could say I only have 3/4 of a play.  However, it was enough for me to count it as "played", and I think I was well on my way to winning the game too.  I am familar with and have played other of the crayon rail games as well, so bascially I knew the rules of the game already, just a new map and new resource types.  No offense to the Chinese but I don't care about playing on a map of China.  It just made it super hard for me to find where the different cities are and a lot of cities have similar looking names which added to my confusion.  So I have to drop it a point just because I would rather play other crayon games instead of this version.  I don't dislike the crayon rail games in general, and if none of the others were available but this one and someone wanted to play it I would be game for it.  They are not my all-time favorite type of game, they are bit long and repetitive especially if one or two people start to run away with it.  But overall they are good clever planning games.

Most recent release in the Empire Builder Franchise.  The container shipping to/from Taiwan is different.  I think the game way over favors long runs going East to West and West to East and makes for a short unbalanced game in favor of those who can build to the West early.

The Party Congress event is a game-breaker - a player can easily lose six turns to it.  The deck is unbalanced - some deliveries priced too high/low and too many parallel deliveries.  imho, this is the worst of the Empire Builder series.

This is not the kind of game I'll pull out to finish out a game night, nor is it one I'll pull off the shelves lightly. When we play this one, we are going to game - and game hard. At the same time, it's not too terribly taxing on the brain, just immensely involving. Because it takes so long to play, it probably won't get played that often; but when it does get played, the time will be memorable. I wouldn't recommend it as the introduction to the series, but it wouldn't be horrible either - just not as good as the others. Still, I enjoyed the game quite a bit and recommend it to anyone who has wanted to start their own train empire. And the geography lesson about China certainly doesn't hurt. See my review for more details...

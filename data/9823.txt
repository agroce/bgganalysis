RATING: 9
WOW, great game and does NOT play at all like some other tactical games out there. There is a very minimal downtime and the game almost feels like an extreme puzzle...it is difficult to explain but if you never tried it before you owe it to yourself to at least give it a a go. I recommend using one of the picture by picture guides on the ASLSK page, they are extremely helpful.

Update #1: My appreciation for this game increases with each play...will I get 'The Bug'?...hope not, as this would mean many-a-more purchases.

Update #2: I got the 'The Bug' and have switched over to full-ASL. Be warned - trying this game will cost you A LOT of money in the long run :)

RATING: 8
For me, SK1 as a game in itself is simply too much effort for what little it offers. As a stepping stone towards ASL, SK1 is the obvious place to start. As a game on its own, however, I'd rather play one of the many alternatives.

EDIT: After more plays I like this better. Once the rules were thoroughly learned the game played much faster and I started to notice interesting tactical subtleties that I find interesting. The scenarios are excellent and I also like to play it solo.

Probably the best release of 2004.  COming home to its SL roots is a long overdue decision by MMP.  Many, many gamers I know are rediscoving SL through the use of the Starter Kit.  Most of fun and only a fraction of the work of ASL.

RATING: 6
2016.August. Downgrade the rating to a 6.

The implementation of the Starter Kit revived this classic of tactical WW2 combat, returning it to a decent level of gameplay;
but the heavy procedual turn phases and pedantic detail are inheritances of the archaic system originated from 80s of the past century.
Estrained and clumsy clearly overtaken by more modern and dynamic systems.
The ASL system is plaged by unrealistic nonsense stuff:
- The Melee/close combat resolution can last forever and is used to drag instead of settling quickly the situation as in the real world!
- No command rules (leaders give only bonus to combat and to recover broken squads in the same hex),
- Pedantic downgrade quality of units during combat(?!)
- Exaggerated use of abbreviations,
- Unbalanced and heavy luck dependent CRT,
- Silly support weapons transfer rules,
- Overcomplicated rules to Rout resolutions,
During play, players sttruggle with LOS checks, stacks of counters and administrative markers in small hexes.

Nevertheless these issues , ASKSK can still provide some fun moments.

Of course I dont care about the ASL.

A SK scenario can be played in 2-3 hours.

This rating covers all the starter kits because they really all do the same thing and that is to slowly integrate more and more rules.  Starter kit 1 is for infantry and support weapons, Starter kit 2 introduces ordnance, and Starter kit 3 introduces vehicles.  I think the best way to learn the game is to start with everything, skipping the starter kits altogether, and learning as you play with a veteran of the game.  But if that option isn't the way you want to go, or if said veteran of the game is not available, then by all means, the starter kits are an excellent option.

RATING: 10
Excellent starter game that brings those who wanted to take the plunched into the deep end of the pool.

Introduces infantry warfare in its simple and easy to follow, step by step game explanation.

Each scenario could be done in 1 hour or less.

This is the game that introduced me to ASL which has overshadowed all my previous gaming experiences. ASL is imply the best system ever. Period. No discussing about this. Yet, the ASKSK is somehow sketchy in some points and I believe must be played by people like me who are already planning to get into the whole system. If you take it as stand alone game, it may not satisfy your expectations. If you take it as step in a process... wow!!!!!

This plays well right out of the box. It is accessible. The only thing still over complicated is the defending fire during the movement phase. Everything else goes easy, but is very fiddly with the counters. 

If you want something even faster and a lot less fiddly try the Retro Variant Rules for ASL/ASLSK. You can play all the ASL stuff with a minimum set of rules and still have the ASL feeling. Very enjoyable and very solo friendly. I would rate playing with Retro a 7, or even an 8 with some clarifications from the author Gary Graber.

Rules could use some clarifications (lots of little things that are not really clear, but after playing a scenario most of that goes away).  Besides that, I think this is a great package (I have never played ASL before but played a little squad leader).  Relatively quick playing time and just enough complexity to get that quick wargaming fix in a small area (you only need a little bit of table space to play this....this is a big appeal to me because while I would love to play GCACW or OCS I just don't have the time or space to commit to something like that...very often anyway, so for me it is a perfect way to acheive some

I once tried to play full ASL. Got the rulebook, Beyond Valor, Paratroops and several maps. I also got Squad Leader (SL)for maps 1-4. I read the rules several times, but when I started to play (3x), several questions arised and I could not find the solutions in the megahuge rulebook. Then I sold everything but SL. Read the SL rules and planned to play it someday. Never happened, 'cause the rules are also tricky. Then a good friend, showed me he got the ASL Kit#1. I read the rules. Next night we played the 1st scenario and got hooked-up. There were several things we forgot, but I re-read the rules the night after and played the other night. I was delightfull. A good turn sequence sheet is a must for this game and it's not included. The 1st scenario is great, 'cause it starts with few units and every side gets reinforcements as the turns go. I still prefer Up Front, but this is a nice game of different scale.

When I first thought about playing Die Macher, I wondered why the hell I would ever play a game about German politics. When I did, I loved every aspect of it. Well, the same is true for ASL. I figured I'd give it a go even though the concept of combat and war appalls me; after all it is a game, right? Now I cannot wait to play this again. I really like the puzzle aspect of figuring out how to maneuver your units while anticipating how your opponent is going to react. I am impressed by how much the game felt narrative to me, which I hadn't expected.

Good intro to the ASL system and great way for Veterans to introduce newbies. I have to remember which ASL rules to drop when I play. Some good scenarios. Overall an excellent package.

After playing SK #2, I'd say the infantry only scenarios are far better in SK #1.

Have downloaded solitaire bot rules and cards, looks interesting and a far easier solo system than used in the Solitaire ASL set.

RATING: 9
First lesson.  Never ever ever double time across an open field within range of your enemy.  I love this series and replay the games in my mind afterwards, always a good sign.

The rules for the starter kits are actually pretty easy.  SK #1 just has 12 pages of rules.  I could explain it to a friend in about 15 minutes to get him started, and then we just started playing with me filling in details as we went.  Play is very intuitive, and these starter kits are good value for the money.

Even more over-hyped than ASL, and reveals how intrinsically difficult it is to get started with ASL.  Secondly, the rules are more about wallowing in the sheer complexity for pure pedantic compulsion, as opposed to simulating or modelling reality.

Excellent introduction to ASL.  This provides the great tactical feel of ASL without the migraine.
Best to play this against someone who knows the rules as they can still be quite fiddly. Best thing produced by MMP in my opinion. Better than the old Squad Leader.

Update: Dropped my rating to 8 because full ASL pretty much consumes my time.

RATING: N/A
Made perfect starter by adding 'ASL Classic' ASL revisions of the early (classic) Squad Leader scenarios - Guards Counterattack, Tractor Works etc. (requires a little counter fudging using original SL counters to keep core set counters largely intact). Oh, and it probably needs some addition of big boy rules along the lines of my SK2 comments for Paratrooper scenarios, with the addition of building levels, factories, berserk/human wave...
Good reference for moving from ASLSK to full ASL:

I like tactical games and this was a very nice introduction.  The various fire phases and the like take some getting used to but after a couple of turns it was all fitting together very well.

I will not fail, I will not fail! *edit* Failed again.*edit* One more try, let's go!  *edit* a couple more solo plays! *edit* failed again, maybe I am just not a fan of "squad scale" tactical level wargames.

Rules are not over complicated and give a good taste of about 65% of what ASL is all about.  Lots of fun!

Well, I suppost this seals my fate..... My Eurogamer soul has officially been corrupted.

It's easy to see why many consider ASL to be the wargame benchmark. From what I've seen it offers a good balance between realism and playability. I'm not sure we got all of the rules right, but that's par-for-the-course I suppose.

Just bought and am working through the scenarios.  After my 1st 3 games I can say that I do like the system.  I tried to play once before using the full rules and was overwhelmed and have not tried it till now.

The starter kit only gives you the basic rules and leaves things out like fire lanes, concealment status etc but it teaches you the new things such as the revamped defensive fire procedures so you can focus on those rather than all at once.

I think once I am done the 6 scenarios I will try the 8 step procedure to learn ASL proper as I also have the original Beyond Valour.  Looking forward to getting back into Squad Leader again.  Its been too long.

I finally played this after owning all three for such a long time, and I have to say, I think this is good fun as a tactical game, and gives you a good feel for the ASL experience in a quite manageable ruleset. They've made a bunch of really good choices about what to include and what to cut. My only gripe - and it's not entirely trivial, admittedly - it the lack of concealment rules. Concealment is admittedly a little tricky and would have meant another non-trivial rules section. On the other hand, concealment is so important to so many ASL scenarios, and if we had it, we could probably play a lot more core ASL scenarios using ASLSK rules (admittedly walls, hedges, and hills would still be problematic in many cases as well).

Anyway, a lot of fun, and good for an ASL fix when you don't want the hassle of the full deal. Another bonus is that all the scenarios I've played have been good. Most other tactical games - even the good ones like Conflict of Heroes - you only need to play a couple scenarios before you hit a real klunker

Best wargame I've played.  Amazingly deep and cinematic.  It takes some effort to learn if you're new to wargames but it's totally worth it.  A lot of replay value, especially for a $20 "intro" module.

Makes for a great stand-alone game and I'd imagine that you could get a ton of play out of this without ever buying another SK or the full game.  It scratches the ASL itch with 100pages of rules or the need to find a teacher. Super-deep too. I'm venturing into full ASL step by step and would really like to play it more. 

NOTE ON THE RULES:  The rulebook could use some improvement.  It is not great for reference because important rules are sometimes scattered and not necessarily where you would expect to find them.  If you do a thorough read-through and give the scattered paragraphs titles and highlight all of the easily forgotten rules, it really isn't too bad. 5

I'd rate it higher if there were some more dice rolling and drm's.  Like every 2 turns, squads should have to take a d6 bladder check to see if they need a bathroom break (+1 drm for the Italians, they drink a lot of coffee), then another d6 to see if it's a #1 or #2 (if #2, need a die roll for chance of getting bit on ass by poisonous spider (+1 drm for conscripts, of course).  No Defensive First Fire in either case, except Elite units, who instead receive a +1 drm and cannot maintain rate of fire with heavy or medium (but not light) machine guns.

ASL may well be a great game, but I have severe reservations about recommending the Starter Kit.  I'm going to jump on the bandwagon that others have laid out and say that this could have been much better done rules-wise.  This took me a number of close readings, print-outs of FAQs and comments on BGG, and several attempts at play-throughs before it clicked somewhat.  A few full-length example turns, along with the nice color diagrams, would have been priceless.  I realize there were examples of certain situations, but it was difficult to see how it all flowed together.  I found something similar online via links from BGG, and that's what clarified lots of the issues I had.  Still, a Starter Kit should include examples like that.  Also, the rule book flows about as well as a technical manual for a router.

Fantastic entry into probably the deepest wargame ever. It's more than enough of a game on its own. Don't feel you need to move on to full ALS. In fact, I'm not sure why they don't release ASLSK as a bigger game in and of itself...

I'm still learning.  And its a game if I don't play it frequently, I'll lose the feel and flow.
But you know its got a hold on me.  I want to play every chance I can get.    I wish the opportunity is more often...yeah, yeah, I know of VASL.  
The fun comes from lots of decisions and lots of action.  Plays quick enough for a three hour session at a coffee shop (sometimes).

Very nice intro game, but you better enlist an experienced ASL player in order to play, the supposed "newbye" rules are an horrible unplayable mess. MMP cannot really think to enlist new players with this rulebook!
Scenarios are OK and it's nice to have everything you need to play (maps and counters) in one little package.

I've played a few scenarios with my brother and we both liked the results.  We're long (long) time fans of the original Squad Leader (with Cross of Iron), playing it occasionally.  Neither of us got into "ASL", for several reasons.  Unlike the "full" ASL rules, these are approachable by those not seeking to invest a lifetime of effort.  The rules are clean and easy to read and use.  Still, even as "starter kits" they are fairly extensive and require a lot of effort to play - that's not a complaint - it is what it is - just an observation.

My TOP3 game. Very useful to learn ASL, together with the excellent [i]Jay Richardson[/i] tutorials, the [i]Matt Boehland[/i] Sheet and the [i]Mike Whittemore[/i] video tutorials. I prefer it over playing full ASL scenarios because it's less complicated, faster, enjoyable and I just love pure [u]infantry[/u] scenarios. I like very much it's defensive fire rules. Every session is challenging and tells a story. A wargame with a great value and a high replayability.
The 2014 reprint has an improved manual.
Very high [color=red]solitaire[/color] suitability (better than full-ASL)!

I'm quite impressed with the way ASL works. There's almost no downtime, which is a little odd for a war game, and there's a healthy amount of give-and-take during a turn. Very nice.

April 9, 2009 -- I went a couple of years between ASLSK1 games, but I'm back. I have a new opponent in the area who is very interested in playing ASL (from the SKs up to full-blown ASL). In the last two weeks, we've played S2 War of the Rats twice, with both of us getting a chance to play each side of the battle. A good, balanced scenario that I've now played three times (and, I think, lost at all three times).

I'm still working my brain around the rules and the strategy, but I'm enjoying getting a chance to finally play again. Slowly, the rules are starting to sink in. Last week's game was rough, but last night's game felt a lot more natural.

I'm really loving this game the more I play it, and I can't wait to get another scenario on the table. I may even set up a scenario to play solitaire to get more comfortable with the rules (there's so much to remember).

RATING: 10
This game is awesome.  I have had the basic ASL rules and Beyond valor since the 1980's, but have never even attempted to play being too intimidated by them.

I picked up the SK#1 after reading some very good reviews about it and deciding I wouldn't be out much as about $20.

After walking through a couple of the Tutorials found here on BGG, I was playing ASL!  I have been obsessed ever since.

This is a great intro into the grandaddy of squad-based tactical wargames.  No tank or guns.  To an extent it seems to portray realistic tactics but elegant/minimalistic/non-fiddly it is not.  Unless this is the only game system you play, expect to refer back to the rulebook constantly (and since this is not the full ASL rulebook, it has no index and uses paragraphs so it's hard to look up exactly what you need). After playing several different systems, I am much more in the Band of Brothers camp for this style of tactical wargame but I see why some people only play Advanced Squad Leader.

If you've read any of the ASL rules and grasped the basic concepts, this is an excellent way to get into the game. Terrain, fire modifiers, and phases of the turns are clearly written and not too overwhelming. If MMP continues to produce more of the same, there will come a point where the player can decide 'how far' to carry the complexity of the different phases. I'd like to see an armor module next.

Do not be intimidated.  You too can learn how to play ASL.  Within an hour of opening the box, I was pushing counter around and shooting at things.  This is a great value for the money.  Be careful, you just might get hooked.

Contrary to what some say, this is not a lifestyle game.  The game does have a huge following of players who are very welcoming and eager to teach.  The game can easily be played over VASSAL.  There are also extensive resources here in the forum to help with learning this game.

See my review.  Entering the world of ASL can be quite a step.  The SKs offer loads of fun in a small package.  Rules a bit rough, see if you can find an ASL vet to walk you through. (December 2010)
------------------------------------------
Coming back to this about three years later, the rules are even worse than I remembered. They are the most awful combination of the narrative rules type, which should be easy to learn but hard to reference, and the legal rules type, which should be hard to learn but easy to reference. This mother is hard to learn and hard to reference. It's almost as if they were written to test one's resolve. "Son, if you can't get past these rules, you don't deserve to be in the ASL community, and we don't want you." 

The good news is that the game is still a great deal of fun. So, um, stick with it, I guess. Maybe someone with a lot of time on their hands will do a rewrite for normal people.

Brilliant distillation of the core mechanics of ASL into 6 pages of rules.  You don't have to be a hardcore grognard to play and enjoy this, although it's not really for novice wargamers either.  (Note that I haven't tried many of the scenarios in this pack yet -- the rating is mainly based on the rules.)

This is what ASL needed; an approachable entry point into the system. Well done.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Despite the "starter kit" tag, I still find the this a bit overwrought compared to original Squad Leader. (eg what is the point of cowering? You are already rolling dice to randomize the combat outcome so why remember to check for doubles just to get a random lesser result. Lower ift results & better numbers on the leader & nongreen unit counters would achieve an identical result). However given the desire to lad people into ASL, the strip outs are reasonable.
The provided scenarios are good with some interesting tactical problems.
I still prefer the old SL for getting people into the system. Especially using Alan Yngve's Alpha/Beta scenarios.
But this is a worthy attempt by MMP.

Probably the best way to get into ASL. I so wish the starter kit had been available 20 years ago when I started spending nights and days trying to learn the full ASL rulebook by myself. Even if I am now a regular ASL player, I always enjoy playing a short and tense game of ASLSK.

ASL Starter Kit #1 is a worthy purchase for anyone who is completely new to the game system and expects a low-cost, low-complexity approach to the basics. Anything needed for a number of pretty engaging scenarios is included, and the rule book is adequate, if a bit obscure in a few paragraphs.

The counters, player aids and maps included in the box are exactly the same format as the ones found in all other ASL products, and hence compatible with them. One minor exception is the rule book itself, which is meant to be stand-alone. All the rules in it are explained in the full edition and even in the subsequent starter kits.

Very good intro to the game and even better for returners like me. Good scenario selection and not too much rules (say 7-8 pages of actual rules here).

So close to perfect.  So close to getting the computer wargamer beople at work in to boardgames.  But just too many die rolls and modifiers to people who like the computer to take care of that stuff.  I love it, but I gotta admit it is only a 6 without the turn breakdown handout from this site.

8-6: Starter kit has to lose a point or two for not having a scenario builder.  Get sick of scenarios that come with it.  War games need to be kits to be great.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Never having attempted to learn ASL before, this was an intriguing package at a great price.  Two maps, one counter sheet, six scenarios and around a dozen pages of rules.  The rules read fairly well, although they lose their way a bit and omit some definitions (CX, Area Fire..?).  What it really needs is a detailed sequence of play, as the various defensive fire options made my head spin.  Still, I've played a couple of scenarios, had a good time, and my appetite is whetted for more.  I guess that's the point.  However... when I go looking for more I find the ASL rulebook is out of print, as is the mandatory Core Module 1, Beyond Valor.  Hmmm....

I would rate this at least an 9, maybe a 10, if it weren't for the terrible rulebook. It seems MMP felt that cutting out the traditional rule numbers would make the game less intimidating to wargame novices. What it does is make it virtually impossible to find anything in the rulebook. Until you've mastered the game, be prepared to spend a LOT of time flipping and scanning through pages. With traditional rule numbers the glossary could have doubled as a proper index.

2015-10-29 : It's 1982 and upon switching schools I come into contact with this "wargaming" thing and fell in love with the original Squad Leader. This was pre-internet days so when a couple years later the magazines starting to run ads for this "Advanced Squad Leader" game I saw it as a money-grab and never left my beloved original game.

Fast forward 30 years, read a lot about ASL in the meantime, but never took the plunge, but then I ran into a cheap copy of the ASLSK #1 and thought what the heck, I'll buy it, try it and then at at least I know if I missed out on it or not.

Playing it brought back a flood of good memories from when playing the original game back then, but I can see where the attraction is for this one : it's more focused and more detailed - but not necessarily more realistic. 

I'll happily explore the game some more, but my wargaming tastes are too broad to solely focus on this lifestyle game so it will remain on the dabbling and sampling side of things.

[b]Advanced Squad Leader: Starter Kit #1

A Great Introduction Into The World Of ASL, And Enough Of A Game For My Taste[/b]

ASLSK#1 introduces infantry units and weapons such as machine guns, flamethrowers and demolition charges. It features eight scenarios, played on a total of two maps. The scenarios cover a variety of tactical situations, and some of them really shine. The rulebook has its issues, mainly its "wall of text" approach. But the important mechanics that set ASL apart from other tactical systems are there, and they work. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
ASLSK has really captured the essence of the classic squad-level combat wargame for me without the cost and complexity of ASL. It's also nice to see ASL going back to the programmed rules format a la SL, except it now does it through a series of games rather than in one box.

As of this writing, there a number of excellent squad-leavel games to choose from and the ASL Starter Kit series is just one of many.  As much as I enjoy playing the full game, I've had nearly as much fun playing the Starter Kits; they stand on their own.  ASL STARTER KIT #1 covers just the infantry system but succeeds far more than SQUAD LEADER ever could have in helping players transition to ASL, should they choose to do so.  Best of all, all the scenarios in the box are tight and interesting contests.  There's not one I would not play, unlike the original SQUAD LEADER where I liked only a third of the situations provided.  

The one flaw in the game is that the rules are not as complete and as clear as they could be, which gets corrected in the other STARTER KITS.  Errata fixes that, but it's still slightly irritating. 

Best of all, ASLSK #1 is very inexpensive and serves as a great "hook" into the rest of the STARTER KITS and--quite probably--into the rest of the ASL system.

How is it that after a lifetime of wargaming I'm still trying to figure out how to get a couple of guys across a street?

Update:  Moved the rating up to a 9.  I've had fun playing these scenarios and they are supporting the starter kits with new scenarios.

I played about 5 starter kit scenarios and then moved up to the regular game.  I think the starter kits are great for learning and I like how portable they are.  I tried paying SK1 by reading the rules, and even as an experienced wargamer I have to admit I found all the phases and details confusing.  Only after I downloaded the walkthroughs here on the Geek (by Jay Richardson) did the light go on.  I download lots of play aids and game walkthroughs, not to mention AARs from various websites.   This game has a strong, active following and there is quite a bit of written material to enjoy.  SK1-3 is a great way to jump in.  If you like old Avalon Hill wargames (and all their historical detail) but want a live, vibrant community of players, then Advanced Squad Leader is the game for you.  

I plan on playing all the starter kit scenarios at some point, but I am drawn to the complete ruleset.  I suppose I like the snipers, hidden placement, concealment, bypass and other chrome that are in the full game.

Nice game with a wonderful price. A great way to taste ASL without the full rules.It's something like the classic Squad Leader with better rules.

[i]Nov 2013[/i]: Rating of 7. 
Same as ASL SK (though I have a slight preference for ASL SK, as it is far less complex and timeconsuming)

[i]Oct 2012[/i]: Rating adjusted: 8 to 7. Intense gameplay. Crunchy game. Well designed scenarios are nailbiters! 

The rules could have been written & organized in a better manner. I had a hard time understanding the rules (not because they were difficult or complex) because they were not well organized and written. The formatting was horrible. It took some time to look up and reference a particular rule. (ASL while dense is well-roganized).

In a nutshell, the appeal of ASL is 1) Theme-rich: playing it is like watching the best kind of war movie.  2) The KING of replayability - scores of scenarios with new ones released regularly and 3) The game play is so rich that in order to be an expert, you must truely be a student of the game.

MMP did a great job with the Starter Kits: including just the right sub-set of the ASL rules to make a more accessible game.  This is what a few players of the Original Squad Leader Game were hoping that ASL would have been when it came out in 1985.

I like that any one of the Starter Kit boxes contains everything that you need to play all the scenarios: the boards, counters and a complete rulebook.  SK #1 is not required.   The rulebook is in a more narrative style than the full ASL Rulebook, some like it, most don't.

SK #1 has some great scenarios in it and is a wonderful game in and of itself if you never buy another ASLSK product.  But... you will.  you will.

This and ASLSK2 reawakened my interest in the whole ASL system.  It's still not a game I'm likely to pull out too often, but it's definitely a fun game to play.

I had to knock this one down a little bit after playing Combat Commander: Europe, and Lock 'n Load Band of Heroes, because I'm much more likely to play either of those instead of ASLSK when I get that itch to play a WWII small unit tactics game.

Like so many of us, I played SL/COI/COD/GI all those years ago and when ASL came out, it was just too much and the times were changing.  I kept tabs on ASL, saw VASL and that people were still playing it when ASLSK#1 was released.  The price was perfect and the reviews here were very good. I could not of been more pleased (except for the mapboard - see others remarks).

I now play on VASL regularly and am making the jump to full ASL junkie.  The ASL rules seem easier to comprehend now and I'm looking forward to other SK releases.

An easier point of entry into ASL for experienced wargamers, but still a pretty big leap for social gamers. I've played ASL for years but I still bought a copy, as faster-playing, infantry-only scenarios are my favorite kind of ASL experience. The only real problem with short and small scenarios is the general level of fragility for some positions, meaning that if you blow your set-up, there may not be much margin for error. But so long as both players are learning how to play at roughly the same rate, this delivers an authentic ASL experience without all the rules load. Be aware, though, that this game is still exponentially more difficult than nearly every other popular game here on BGG. Learning ASL takes real commitment. It's not for everyone, but ASL is probably the most rewarding game I've ever played.

Ok two things come to mind in my beginner learning process: 

1) most of the tactical games out there really take a lot from ASL, it is truly the father of them all; 

2) wow, how useless some rules look. Unnecessary complication. ROF with Sustained Defensive fire I'm talking to you!

Also I'm really unhappy with skulking as it is described, I expect this game to be frigging perfect for the effort required to play it. 

Love to complain. I'll see as I play.

Never got to play it. Too much ado about nothing I guess. Traded. But kept the maps: time to play those with ATS.

Been thinking of rekindling my love affair with ASL so I finally picked this one up.  Looks like the starter kits include the essentials of what make ASL great, w/o the huge learning curve - thus enabling one to learn more about the tactics of the game.  This is what ASL is all about IMHO - infantry tactics.

**Update** Many solitaire plays later, I'm liking this one very much.

Purchased and tried this one, seemed good and somehow very analytical, almost chesslike.

Unfortunately, you´ll only want to use a finite portion of gaming time playing WW2 tactical platoon/company scale games and as that time has pretty much recently been spent playing Combat Commander and Up Front (excellent games on their own right), ASLSK1 has stayed sitting on the shelf.

Need to play more someday. I can see the greatness shining through from it already.

(2 plays) The notoriously dense and detailed game of WW2 tactical combat, condensed to introductory form.  Despite only covering the basics of ASL, the rulebook is very difficult to read.  Initialisms are best left to reference material and player aids, not a rulebook meant to teach the game to ASL n00bs.  The best way to learn this game is to play with an experienced (and forgiving) ASL player.  Once you do learn, however, this is an extremely fun game.  It's interesting to see how events play out, and somehow these square counters and hex maps immerse you in the events.

RATING: 2
It is the most complex tactical wargame there is & there probably ever will be. And if you don't mind (or actually happily looking forward to) reading 100 pages of rules, then this might be something you should look into.. but imho it has been surpassed by .. well by what actually?
Let's say there are much easier titles, and each has it's own shortfalls.. like CoH Conflict of Heroes, Band of Brothers & others.
ASL is using 6 different Phases to create the feel of simultaneousness.. but does only create complexity for complexity sake..

so for example in ASL you can move your units let's say around the enemy, while the enemy has no opportunity to move (they can shoot, but cannot move..). At least in CoH you could simply retreat your unit.

Also ASL knows no real hidden units, yeah you put questionmarks on counters but you still know where the counter is.. while in some other Tactical & block wargames you have no idea where the unit is..! These two things get me way more into the war-theme than to roll 6 dice to find out that the weather is not changing..

RATING: 7
ASL desperately needed an entry route for beginners and the first starter kit achieves the impossible by slimming the 300+ page full ASL rulebook down to a non-threatening 20-page booklet. Equally importantly, it's a complete stand-alone product for about a sixth of the cost of buying the ASL rules plus the Beyond Valor module, which is what would be required to start playing full ASL.

Unfortunately, the rulebook is awful and God help anybody trying to learn the game from it. It doesn't explain concepts well. It's crammed full of nearly as many incomprehensible (and mostly unnecessary) acronyms as full ASL and it doesn't even include all of them in its glossary. The included play aids are also woefully inadequate - there's no detailed sequence of play for a start.

What's really remarkable is that all this is as true of the 10th Anniversary Edition as it was of the first - helping to cement my view of MMP's place at the bottom end of the pack when it comes to production quality, innovation and user friendliness.

Thankfully, all of these flaws are fixed by excellent fan-made tutorials and play aids that can be freely downloaded from BGG. It's shocking that they're necessary but they do transform this into the cheap, accessible introduction it was intended to be.

Personally, I view this very much as a stepping stone to full ASL rather than a system to continue with indefinitely as some people seem to. The fact that this first kit features only infantry and the very bland maps necessitated by the stripped down terrain rules mean that this does get pretty samey after a while.

Anyway, in short, ASLSK 1 is a great idea badly implemented but saved from itself by the support of the public and at a low enough price that it's hard to be too annoyed by it's deficiencies.

The first ever reasonable introduction to the most popular wargaming system: ASL.  The big question is: why did they wait almost 20 years to do this?  Despite a rulebook that assumes at least some prior knowledge of SL or ASL, this package is very well done in my opinion.  This is my first participation in ASL, and I am impressed with the system from what I see in this package.  However, the competing Lock 'N Load system moves a bit faster and features an impulse-based system and spotting rules.  After playing LNL, ASL seems a bit dated to me with its phase-based system.  Still, it's an excellent product and an improvement over original Squad Leader, which was fun but had a certain degree of silliness as well.

An amazing distillation of the ASL rules into a package that is fun and (relatively) easy to play.  All you need to play is in the box.  Once the rules are down, play is fast and furious, with lots of interaction between the players.  It's still not a game for the feint of heart, but I've gotten my teenage sons to play it (and beat me).  This kit comes with Germans, Americans, and Russians infantry and leaders, and their support weapons (machine guns, demo charges and flamethrowers).

This was an awful lot of fun once I got into the swing of it, even though I'm pretty sure I'm still messing up about 10% of the rules.  But even though this is called a "starter kit", it is NOT for the faint of heart, especially if you don't have a couple other wargames under your belt.  I was familiar with the basics before I even got the game (particularly the DFF/SFF/FPF distinctions), I read through the rules 2 or 3 times before setting up, and the first couple turns were STILL slower than molasses (10 minutes per phase spent double checking rules, etc.)  

Update: I haven't touched this since I got Combat Commander.  If I was serious about making the leap to full ASL, I might take this out for a test drive.  But CC and its expansions are still scratching the itch for me . . .

Simplified ASL, featuring infantry only. Scenarios probably suffer a bit in terms of diversity from being infantry-only (and being limited to three nationalities), but overall complexity level is right on the spot (good riddance to most of the "little" rules left out, IMO). On the other hand, while leaving out hexside terrain (and hills!) simplifies terrain rules significantly, it does so at the expense of detail and diversity. Same with rules for concealment, which is a major element of real ASL.

As an old ASL player, even after not playing the full game in a decade or so, I was able to dive straight into this with almost no rules questions.

Great game!

RATING: 6
Most of the good of ASL, much less reading.  But if they want to hook new players, a real starter kit with a half map board, couple hundred counters and 4 pages of rules all for 10 bucks is what they should have done.  Instead, these are well balanced, solitaire-suited ASL games.  Still fun but not something a typical new player will be able to handle on their own.

I'm torn on my rating for this one.  As an ASL newbie, I found that the rulebook was not adequate.  It used some terms that it didn't define.  It is lacking a clear sequence of play and is in dire need of detailed, move-by-move, examples of a few turns.  That being stated, I got a chance to play it with an ASL vet and it seems like just the kind of game that I would love.  I have a pre-order in for Starter Kit #2.  Let's hope that they get the rulebook right this time. (If so, my rating will probably go up a bunch)

I have been a war-gamer for some 40 years and the rules (as written) are the worst I have seen in years. They are almost incomprehensible and create as many questions as they answer. And you can never find anything - important information is mentioned in a sentence in the middle of an unrelated paragraph. I have now played two scenarios and it has potential and could certainly be fun - but you need to devote a substantial amount of time just to get started.

My son and I were bemoaning the lack of two-player games we had that we actually wanted to play when my wife suggested BoardGameGeek as a possible source of good games. One of the results of this was our acquistion of ASLSK#1 (see, I'm and ASL geek already). First impressions is that the rules were loaded with TLAs and worse but when we had got over that the rules seemed simple enough to be able to start playing right away. A thing I have never encountered before in this sort of war game. The good news is that my son wants to play some more (Hooray!). The bad news is that I lost.

We have actually played the first three scenarios now (in three days) - still not got the hang of all the tactics and keep finding we forgot important rules. But definitely encouraged to buy the BIG game and start on those scenarios too. I'ts a pity the starter kit #2 is out of print as I like the gentle phased approach, but we will just have to make do with starter kit #3.

After several months of thinking about it, I finally broke down and bought all 3 starter kits.  I have now played this close to 2 dozen times on VASL.  I am loving it and can hardly wait to pick up the full rules.

I have played this many many times on Vasl and Face to Face.  I have also picked up the full rules and feel confident that in a couple of years I might be able to play one of the simple scenarios out of Paratrooper!

RATING: 8
Basic system is sound (and not too hard to pick up), but the rulebook isn't too hot - you'll do much better having someone show you how to play.  Graphics are rooted in the past, but functional enough (type could be larger on some units).

For me, the major strength is that it appears well-tested and the scenarios are not merely puzzles relying on whether or not the attacker comes up with the correct solution.  Indeed, most seem to possess quite a bit of replay value, thanks to the free set ups and room for different approaches.

Once you made it through the overly condensed wall-of-text-style rules with dozens of abbreviations, there's a neat tactical game to discover underneath.

Good:
- some mechanics are very clever like residual fire, MG rates of fire, morale effets.

Overall we quite liked it but also aggreed that it is not worth effort.

RATING: 7
I have a sort of love/hate opinion on ASL these days.  ASL itself is that sort of lifestyle game where you can only really play it and nothing else due to its huge rules, time and money commitment.  The Starter Kits then should be much more approachable by comparison.  Well they are in a way but are not in others.  The ways they are not are more significant than the ways that they are.  The rules are still written in 1970's style and that's basically where you can stop.  I find them easy enough because I played everything from Squad Leader through ASL as a young teen.  But most anyone else is going to just run screaming.  The ultimate irony is games like Conflict of Heroes use the programmed rules approach that Squad Leader nearly invented.  When you could read just a little blurb back then for SL and get started playing why this far more complex approach with the starter kits?
Still the first Starter Kit if you really break it down might have 4 pages of rules in all actuality.  The next two Starter Kits are much more difficult to slog through by comparison.  It's no secret these really only exist to get you onto the full ASL game system as there has been little support or interest in maintaining an ASL-Lite so there is why I've parted with it.
I don't want to become a full ASL player these days so the starter kits have no value to me.  Better to just stick with other alternative game systems which continue to be directly supported with expansions and additional content.
I do miss the nostalgic value in looking at theses games and having them on my shelf however.

This belongs to vindigo but I borrowed the game to re-learn the rules.  The rules don't include some of the things I remember that I thought were very interesting:

1. Fire-lanes for Machine Gun Support Weapons (MG SW).
2. Dash movement.
3. Bypass movement.
4. Hidden Initial Placement (HIP)
5. Concealment markers.

However, I can see why this game is so popular with grognards; it is very detailed.  I do like the game a lot but I think I'll be hard-pressed to find any challengers in my neighborhood and the time to play.

This truly is a GREAT package - a great little game and amazing value. 

The only real issue the excessive amount of rules and the fact you have to 'keep your hand in' if you don't want to have to re-lean it every few months.

But, at this price - just get it and feel the tension of a REAL game!

For non-wargamers, this game sortof boggles their minds. There is a fair amount of detail within the game, and new players are often simultaneously impressed and intimidated.

Finally a manageable ASL training kit. It is still rather limited due to the simpler rules, but at least you get to understand Defensive First Fire, Subsequent First Fire, & Final Protective Fire! I think the progression of who gets to fire when in ASL is one of its strongest points, but also one of the more difficult one to understand.

The introductory version to ASL we have been expecting for years. Finally it has come, and better than expected. You can be playing ASL infantry one hour after opening the box.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The fallacy of realism continues...This time around it was presented as if it were a simple wargame, with lot of infantry actions on the eastern front.  A starter kit for a super-tactical game first released 20 years ago and still going strong.  This is a complete game by itself and the original game is not required. The game is designed to serve the purpose to attract new and young blood into board wargaming.  The ASLSK features 6 scenarios on infantry action on both the eastern (2) and western front (4 in the year 1944). The eastern front is a theatre of war of which I am so engaged in.  Even though I am not an ASL fan, I am also lured to buy a copy of it because the components are so beautifully done and scenarios carefully constructed, mostly focusing on taking control of the buildings.  Some special nice rules, as usual, are well written like variable reinforcements, increased effectiveness of the elite units using smoke, winter camoflage advantage of the Siberians... Victory conditions are balanced from what I've reviewed.  The hardest part is the opporutnity fire in the movment phase (residual fire plus first, subsequent and final protective fire).  But anyone can become familiarize with it after several plays.  Eric Walter's article (check it out here: https://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/26880379#26880379) does explain some of the myth and burn in my head about the multiple defensive fire system, which I find it hard to understand.  Well, if it is that dilemmas the designer is looking for, the threading of a minute time into three fire phases is still too much for my cognitive system about time and space in a game turn. The single big plus is the wealth of scenarios, over 2,000 to choose from.  Despite some important original concepts like CX, meaning Double Exhaustion, is not defined in the rulebook, I have to say it is a really nice effort overall and a good presentation indeed.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This starter kit is an amazing piece of work. To take hundreds of pages of full ASL and boil them down to their purest essence must have been no easy feat. I have played this numerous times and have almost always had a tight game every time. It's an amazing tool for teaching the series and huge value for your money. This is one of my top favorites in my entire collection.

The 'easy' entry into the church of ASL - I'm very curious about the system, and the intro scenarios cover some airborne action, so what's not to like? 

ASLSK seems to be the right level of complexity for an introduction to the core of the system (should I say ecosystem?). With 4 pages of rules (which mostly make sense on their own), this is definitely accessible for most, but could have done with a more modern presentation. With the number of counters and scenarios there is a nice amount of bang for the buck.

Now for the review: I have played the first scenario 3 times, refining tactics and "gaming the system". I really wanted to love ASL, but: there is a lot of gamey tactics needed to succeed, and you *really* have to be attentive to all the little details during setup - and that becomes a bit exhaustive. ASL feels like it would become an optimisation exercise for me, in stead of a more freeflowing tactical experience - and that even before stepping to the full monty. In the end I think ASL is not for me, but I am in awe of those who do make it their hobby!

OK game that captures some of the thrill of playing Squad Leader.  Surprisingly bad rules for what one would think is a careful attempt to draw in new blood.

I bought this in a last-ditch attempt to teach myself the rudiments of the ASL system (I've always yearned to play Red Barricades).

Very nice box art, though.

My two highest rated games couldn't be much different.  Cosmic Encounter is whimsical and Advanaced Squad Leader is intricate and yet I appreciate them both.  ASL leaves you feeling drained after every session, it is war in every sense of the word.  I realize the rules are complicated and overwhelming, but for me its worth it.  There is so much to explore and every decision and die roll effects everything else.  I tend to wonder if I had played it more would the rating go down...maybe it would, but for now, I can't wait to sit down and stare at the map again.

As far as it goes, the Starter Kit is a good game of infantry tactics in its own right, and a good introduction to the Advanced Squad Leader system. Although the Starter Kit 1 rules don't cover all the ground of the binder rules, they are much more clearly organized. Unfortunately the Starter Kit 2 rules start introducing what, to me, seem excessively complicated and inconsistent systems.

I've not played this but bought it thinking I might coax some of my friends into playing ASL. Instead, I've given up on the whole series. I rated it based on the fact I was disappointed with some of the rules from ASL that were purged out in order to make the Starter Kit more accessible.

Even though it's a ramped up learning curve, every time I've messed around with it I've been left feeling like I could better spend my time with something else. I think the issue is that for me personally, WWII is no where near as appealing as fantastical or Sci Fi themes so while I'll happily devour countless D&D rule books, I just don't have the spark to push through with this.But, I can say that I do totally get why people are so bonkers for it because it really does seem like an amazing system.

Marketting genius. Take ASL, THE monster game of squad-level combat and break it into digestable, nicely packaged morsels and you have the SK series. SK1 deals soley with infantry combat. Germans, Soviets and Americans are featured.


5-5-09 bumped rating down 1 point to 6. Good game, just not what I want to play on a regular, or even semi-regular basis.

Initial Impression - this is an excellent game. It has a very steep learning curve, but once learned it can be a very rewarding game experience.

I like the Starter Kit series.  It is an excellent way to break the game down into smaller pieces. This makes a perfect tool for scaling - the teaching practice of breaking down a complicated subject into more managable pieces.

This is as good an introduction to ASL as you will find. Very clear instructions with loads of beautiful color examples. Numerous scenarios that ramp you into the complexities of the game. If you are determined to slug your way through ASL it all starts here. But honestly, all of the fun and playability of the original Squad Leader is lost. I don't completely blame ASL for this. They really started fouling up the system with Anvil of Victory. But ASL just gets tedious. Maybe if I invested a few more years in the system it would seem smoother. If you want the most detailed and realistic sim available this is it. If you want to have a great time playing a wonderful system that balances enjoyment, game play and simulation stick to the original Squad Leader with the Cross of Iron expansion.

Result!  Playable, accessible and affordable, the Starter Kit has made 90% of the goodness of ASL available to everyone with minimal cost and modest effort.

A job well done by MMP - now just try to keep it available.

First two scenarios very positive, although scenario two seemed a bit unbalanced against the Soviets. The rules, while complex, do feel intuitive (except that the four types of defensive fire need a little getting used to). Seems like what I remember from days gone by when I played SL/ASL. It is also VERY similar to Critical Hit's ATS, but probably more detailed. ASLSK1 has better production values than the CH Basic Games (1a at least). I should make a cheat-sheet for when all of the control markers are removed.

Great intro package to ASL as well as a pretty darn good stand alone game.

Makes me wish I could get a couple gaming friends way into struggling through ASL.  I feel like that is what it would take for me to really get the rules...they are a bit confusing and dense.  I'll probably pick up the other starter kits (ASLSK #2 and #3 when it comes out) if for no other reason than to satisfy my curiosity.

>>update<<
meh...I've decided that this is a really neat system but is ultimately not that exciting to me.  After a few plays I still have a tiny desire to get deep into ASL, but whatever.  Dropped rating to a 6.

Actually pretty fun even for an ASL vet.  Makes the game go way quicker, but that could also be because the scenarios are small.  Some of these also feel like "trick" scenarios where you need to know the trick to have a chance at winning them, but I think the same could be said of many ASL scenarios, and how else do you learn the tricks other than playing them?  I like that this set is bringing in new players to the ASL hobby and heartily recommend it even if you don't plan to go all the way into the full ASL game.

Just recently started playing this despite owning it for the past 3 years or so.  The rules are very dense and not very clear in sk1, but sk3 clears up some of the vagueness regarding infantry.

The thing that is kind of bugging me is the endless dice rolling for everything.  It reminds me of Warhammer games (roll to hit, roll to wound, roll to save, roll to check leadership, etc).  However, the tense turns make this a very fun game, and I think I can overlook the dice rolling for now.

This is a great contribution to the ASL universe. It is impressive that the rules have been reduced to 12 pages.

It is still easiest to learn ASL and ASLSK from someone who has played the game or by reading Jay Richardson's execellent tutorials, for these ASLSK rules are still hard to learn on your own. This is still no Euro. This is all-out wargaming.

But these rules do a great service of distilling the essence of the ASL system into a very small and manageable rules-set.

The starter kit scenarios are very good.

The 3 starter kits and Jay Richardson's excellent tutorials on BGG have made ASL much more accessible for those trying to learn and enjoy it.

Feels dated, compared to other WWII squad level games, but altogether, the ASLSK is still a decent and fine game of its own.

Rules are surprisingly intuitive. All the buzz about complicated details is futile. BUT: The rule book could have been a lot more user friendly. This is just the opposite of a bloated FFG prouction. The ASLSK rules are too condensed. If you look for a specific information, you just don't exactly know where to find it.

I have not played ASL for many, many years and doubted that I ever would again after giving up my collection. 

I picked up this Starter Kit due to its wonderfully reasonable price and proceeded to enjoy all of its scenarios in two fun months where I was not tempted to play much of anything else.  

Very good collection both for people thinking about getting into the system but also for old timers who have left the game but still want a smaller/lighter version to enjoy from time to time. 

Subtracting one point for the rulebook - I feel it should have been a bit more "fun" and easier to read for a beginner. I had no problems, but I don't think a completely brand new player will have an easy time with it.

I find it extremely rewarding to find working attack plan after a lot of thinking! This game is just great!

[floatleft][ImageID=103719][/floatleft]An over simplified version of [thing=243][/thing] that is a completely self contained game and not reliant on modules like its forebearer. SK1 focuses only on infantry. If someone is interested in the ASL system, SK1 is a good launching point for them. As a stand alone game, SK1 has excellent replayability value and does an excellent job of showcasing what makes the ASL system amazing. The problem with SK1 is that once someone has graduated to full ASL, it becomes daunting to distinguish the rules discrepancies between the two separate games and renders the starter kit system almost obsolete. The Starter Kit system lacks some of the full ASL chrome such as bypass or concealment that seem almost necessary after playing the full game. This does not mean that I don't enjoy SK1, far from it actually, but I would rather focus my attention on full ASL, rather than trying to remember the differences between the two games.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Had an opportunity to observe and play the first scenario with the Abq ASL group. Even as an all infantry, no support weapons, city fight it is clear that ASL (as simplified by SK#1) contains an additional layer of detail beyond the same situations represented in basic SL. This increased fineness in 'granularity' adds more gradual effects that also increases both the decision making and the influence of randomness imposed by the wide ranging possibilities introduced by nearly every throw of the dice. Whereas SL might be seen as quick, sharp and brutal, ASL is a more slow-motion death ballet.

Second play of Scenario 1 still had a number of mistakes. Seems I can't absorb all the ASL detail even at this level. The scenario broke open on turn 4 when the Americans rolled a 2 on a 20FP +2 shot. Somehow it made all the rest of the maneuvering and die rolling seem like a lot of effort dominated by one DR. May not be a lot of replay value in this scenario as the Victory Conditions focus all the action in the same few hexes with everything dependent on a few DR.

Next S#1 play also seemed to be dominated by one low roll. Maybe, in a larger scenario one roll would not be the deciding factor. We gave scenario #1 a 5 (6 & 4).

S#2 playing continued the inability of the Germans to roll anything decent while the Russians picked up where the Americans left off, so many low rolls that it was hopeless half way through.

Beginning to think that all the extra detail beyond Basic SL isn't worth it; SL has 50% of the rules, 90% of the 'realism' and 100% of the fun.

The search for which WWII, tactical game would be the one for me ended here. 

This is what I was looking for. Thrilling and cinematic. The way things unfold just makes. 

I love how both players need to stay fully engaged through each phase of each turn and that there are so many brutal, risk/reward, decisions to be chewed over. Being heroic can be a very bloody affair, yet play things too safe and it could cost you the game.

Really looking forward to diving deeper into these Starter Kits.

Also,  Joe Steadman's written and video tutorials proved invaluable in helping me to get my head around the rules. Highly recommended.

Played my first game in Jan of 06.  What a great game that now can be started without too much difficulty.  Someone needs to know the rules well to play.

What a great game for those who like simulations.  We are getting much faster at playing the game.

RATING: 7
The upside:
-Even if this the most striped out ASL experience I get why the full blown thing is so mythical.
-I like the old-school look.
-All the phases of your turn configure different approaches for your squads, and trying to come up with the best plan is fun. Watch it unfold on the verge of annihilation is something incredible.
-Maybe the best on ration price/value.

The downside:
-It's a tough to learn, and to remember all the tiny rules and exception in the heat of battle, since the rulebook is not made for reference.
-Deserved better scenarios.

Played through a brief tutorial with a longtime ASL guru. Very procedural and desperately in need of polished player aids. Second play was much better through an entire scenario. Played only with infantry, no support weapons, and no vehicles, so the complexity was minimal. It's unlikely to replace Combat Commander or Lock 'n Load for me any time soon, it creates a nice narrative.

On purely practical and philosophical merits, I really do not like the starter kits.  I know they are were an attempt to bring new players into the game but it does not work.  It has been my experience that many people never advance past these and the resources that went into them should have been used to produce more real ASL products.  To make matters worse, an additional expansion has been created to water done the system even more.  If a person is to lazy to learn the game from the ground up they will never make the leap to real ASL.  In summation, playing the starter kits is lot like masturbation, it might be nice but sex with a real person is a whole lot better.

Thanks to Don Greenwood and Avalon Hill, this is a game system that changed war gaming forever. SK1 is all I need for an ASL fix at this point in life.  I owned the original  game and then bought the  ASL rules in the mid 90s, but this abridgment/tutorial is a comfortable fit for tactical squad-level encounters. CCE, with its accessiblility, will get more table time,but this starter kit is king in terms of its legendary status, and for that reason it gets the highest rating.

RATING: 7
There is a level in this game that is certainly a ten for me, and there are many other aspects that lower it down.  The game actually gives me a head ache, but I think with regular plays and good pool of opponents this game could maintain a ten for a very long time.  I do wish the board and pieces where larger though.  When most of a games action takes place within the area the size of a CD/DVD, you realize you could actually bump heads with your opponent.

I don't often play Starter Kit scenarios, as I greatly prefer using the full ASL rules, but the Starter Kits are still about the best thing that ever happened to ASL. They are perfect for attracting new players to the game, and, for some people, the Starter Kits will be exactly what they want in a wargame... and that's OK too. Those who fear that the Starter Kits may eventually end up competing with ASL - to the detriment of ASL itself - seem to not have a very high opinion of ASL! As good as the Starter Kits are, regular ASL is still far better.

Purchased May 17th 2007, first game May 21st.

It has been played and enjoyed.  The rules are poorly written.  I  don't see how anyone can dispute this. However, the game is learnable.  

I'm completely hooked.  I feel like a little kid again.

I rate this a 10 not only because of the system and the mechanics, but also for the scenarios! Virtually all of them are hits and good for several plays.

"Plays" represents any scenario from S1 to S8.

I downgraded the rating because now I play full ASL and I'm not all that interested in Starter Kit anymore. I went back and played a SK scenario and it was pretty boring compared to the full ruleset. That said, I think SK was a marvelous invention and the catalyst for my ASL fanaticism.

Based on two plays. It is an incredibly detailed WWII tactical simulation and is state of the art in wargaming - for the 1980's. On the down side, it is almost an RPG in its level of dice determination, the mapboard is unmounted and the counters are microscopic with tiny fonts to convey vast amounts of information. Frankly I would have liked it better if it had taken some advantage of the advances made in gaming over the last 20 years.

Finally!  ASL has cured the biggest complaint I've had about it for years!  I wasn't interested in this until I saw a friend's copy.  When I saw it I said "Woohoo!  They've reprinted Squad Leader!"

RATING: 8
Brilliant distillation of ASL, a fork of ASL, a game unto its own. Could not believe the game was playable in about 8 pages of rules! The upward compatibility with ASL is a bonus. Scenario #1 is the best, a classic. Also a great way to play solo since there is no ?, HIP and other things. Games move fast with emphasis on move and combat. Only rule I miss is Heat of Battle.

Hard core ASL players who put it down are missing the point. So far I've had more fun playing SK than ASL, though I have not given up on ASL (yet) since it has so many products. The ASL notion that complexity = reality is incorrect, ASL is no more real than SK, they are both extremely unrealistic. That insight allowed me to see the complexity of ASL as basically playing against the rules - every move is under the question of the endless rule book with its endless exceptions. Fine for those who enjoy reading and memorizing rules, but to me rules are a means to an end. ASL over complicates on purpose. SK returns to its roots in SL which is the game most people really enjoyed.

Good entry to ASL! 6 scenarios included.

I played original SL back in the day. ASL SK1 successfully recreates that nostalgia, and I recall enjoying the infantry part best (vehicles started to get more fiddly).

But even just infantry has some quite fiddly rules! If you are new to the system, you'll probably be wise to download some tutorials and example playthroughs, and read through the Rules forum a bit. Like many people, I learned ASL SK1 soloing through scenarios myself, and definitely found it useful to read some tutorials etc, which helped me discover things I'd overlooked or misunderstood.

Make no mistake, this is a tricky system with subtle complexities, and people new to wargaming in the first place should probably start with something simpler. This is an intro to ASL for people who are already used to wargames, not an intro to wargaming. :)

The 12-page rulebook is fairly clearly written, but annoyingly in big dense walls of text, instead of in individual rule cases (probably to squeeze it into 12 pages), so it's a real pain finding info (often buried in the middle of a long paragraph), and a pain citing specific rules e.g. in forum discussions.

Physical quality is nice. 2 cardstock maps, I like the SL/ASL map graphic design style, and sheet of well-cut counters with the classic old school SL style art. (People who only like mounted boards with photorealistic art and big deluxe counters with colorful art may want to avoid ASL.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I like the maps. I like the concept. The counters seem a little heavier, and the pics on the counters are slightly zoomed (i.e., larger) than on the originals. 

The idea is a good one, but I'd rather it were less 'different' that ASL. That said, glad to have it, and if it gets someone playing, so much the better.

I really wanted to like this game, especially since its annual convention is about a five minute drive from my house.  But honestly, it feels really procedural, with "best practices" painted all over it.  I don't see any encouragement for experimental play, and there are some [u]really[/u] gamey aspects to it.  As a rookie player it looks to me like you're playing to the rules, not to the subject matter.  That makes it feel hokey and uninspiring.  

People may tell you that it's trying to simulate reality too much, but I'll tell you what, when a squad comes out of a building into open ground to avoid being in line of sight for Defensive Fire Phase, and then advances back into the building right after that phase on the same turn you don't have a model of reality, you have a model of avoiding a die roll.  That's what happens when your opponent knows the location and firepower of every unit you own on the board.  Without stealth the battlefield becomes a ledger sheet.

It may be that the bigger ruleset expands the game sufficiently to remove this aspect, but I don't see any sneak, any unknown aspect to the game at this level.  Without that there doesn't appear to be a way to play your [u]own[/u] game.  There's a "best" way to do what you're trying to do, and your opponent makes the "best" response based on assuming a roll of 7 and playing the odds.  I have no doubt that winning is about the player with the most knowledge of the game, but that knowledge appears to me to apply to each situation in one particular way.  The player with the most experience finds the single best solution more quickly and more dependably than the other.

Question -- as players get better, do their approaches to situations tend to converge?  Do they tend to play more the same with more experience?  That's not a rhetorical question.  I'd like to hear from seasoned players.  Does a seasoned vet of the game do unpredictable things?

I'm giving it one more shot hoping it shows me a surprise somewhere.  There's no surprise concept in the rules, at least not in the Starter Kit.  I'd like it if the other player didn't know which of my units was carrying each piece of gear and which leaders were where.

I know this is going to sound blasphemous to you guys, but ASLSK#1 really reminds me of Warhammer 40K (probably because GW stole a bunch of stuff from ASL). Both have overwatch, line of sight, break tests, wound counters etc.

Anyway ASLSK#1 is great value for money, and is one of the more enjoyable wargames I've played. It's a shame the hexes and counters are so small, because it's hard to do anything without toppling counter stacks onto the map (deluxe ASL with the big hexes looks very cool / sensible). 

ASLSK#1 is pretty much at its bang-for-buck limit in terms of rules, though... can't see myself going beyond the starter kits into full ASL any time soon. And you don't need to, really, given the huge replayability of the SK scenarios.

One of the big selling points of the Starter Kits is that the scenarios are usually playable in 3 hours. That means you can have a friend around after dinner (on a school night, even!) and be able to play a real hex-and-counter wargame.

Das vielleicht beste Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis im Wargaming-Bereich. Das Regelwerk ist zwar gnadenlos undurchsichtig und anstrengend gechrieben aber dank der herausragenden Tutorials hier im Geek kommen selbst unbedarfte Naturen wie ich relativ schnell zu ersten flüssigen Spielerlebnissen.
Nun werde ich sicherlich niemals ein eingefleischter Wargamer, aber ich kann die Popularität von ASL gut nachvollziehen. Die Szenarios sind hoch spannend und bieten eine Menge Spielraum für taktischen und strategischen Tiefgang. Trotz viel Würfelei hatte ich selten das Gefühl, dass die Augenzahlen meine Geschicke lenken, vielmehr waren es klar nachvollziehbare Fehler meinerseits, die zur Niederlage führten.

Alles in allem ein klasse Spiel(-system), das sicher noch so manches Mal auf den Tisch kommt. Bei dem Preis sollte eigentlich jeder mal reinschnuppern.

Just a great intro to the ASL experience without the overhead of the ASL chrome.  I like how guns and vehicles were left out for future modules because infantry scenarios are the way to learn this system.

One thing I do miss is snipers and HOB mechanics that give it the extra storyline that makes ASL so much fun to experience.

The best WW2 tactical game is introduced by this starter kit. It lays the foundation upon which later starter kits build to ease you into the full world of ASL. It works well as a stand alone game. The gameplay is very interactive and full of interesting decisions. The initial setup is flexible and the victory conditions of each scenario is different. Combine that with the dice and you get huge replayability. I love the ranged fire aspect and the sense of immersion and creating a unique story that is experienced while playing. Unfortunately the rulebook is extremely dense and should be completely rewritten to make it easier for newbies to learn the game from scratch. I would not have been able to learn it without the tutorials of richfam. Don't be intimidated by the rules though; they make sense and when taught by someone who knows them well, it's easy enough to learn and enjoy.

RATING: 9
It's important to realise what [b]ASL[/b] is and what it isn't. It's been best described to me by fans as playing an interactive war movie. The sequence of play involves very little down time for players and a massive number of interesting decision points, with the focus on individual heroics. It's not trying to be realistic, and use of historical tactics will likely see your forces underperform at best, and cut to ribbons at worst.

There are significant realism issues with this game, such as using the flaws of the turn sequence to move out of then advance back into a hex to become immune to defender fire. The two biggest issues are a lack of command and control mechanics, something most regular players will readily admit, and the second is an early First World War mentality when it comes to machine guns. The assumption is that a swarm of attackers can overwhelm machine gun nests through a long approach across open ground, where some units will simply shrug off bullets through pure elan.

Since there's no suppression, only pinning and breaking, combined with an unnaturally low rate of fire for machine guns, it's advisable to swarm a machine gun nest covering a 60-120° arc with long lanes of fire, charging out into the open with as many troops as possible. Try the same thing in the [b]Combat Mission[/b] series and you'll end up with a lot of dead and pinned squads, taking very little ground. Machine guns are chronically underpowered in terms of rate of fire, amount of ammunition, and ability to engage multiple threats across its firing arc. In [b]ASL[/b] the machine gun is assumed to function like a more powerful rifle than as a separate class of weapons system.

The scenarios are designed for gameplay balance rather than a historical representation of the balance of forces. In the Second World War, the Soviets defend their front lightly and use defence in depth, whilst the Germans like to mass an enormous amount of firepower on a very narrow frontage. In game terms, this would be represented by a single Soviet platoon facing several German companies, which is obviously no fun for the Soviet defender. [b]ASL[/b] is primarily suited to small unit actions involving no more than one platoon per side. Once you include more forces, strange results start to occur and the system breaks down.

Another issue, which actually sort of works both in favour and against the system, are binary victory conditions. Instead of graduated victory conditions, there's usually only one or two considerations for determining victory. For example, capturing objectives can enable you to completely ignore losses. However, such extreme victory conditions can give the outmatched side more than a fighting chance, giving players an incentive to fight till the end of a scenario. The sheer number of die rolls and variability in results mean that there are wild swings in fortunes, so it's rarely ever a case of one side amassing such an early advantage their victory is guaranteed.

For realism, [b]ASL[/b] is clearly deficient. But for immersion in a gripping narrative and forcing players to make a lot of painstaking decisions, [b]ASL[/b] is one of the best wargames out there. Despite it's onerous rules, it's clear why after so many decades it still has a loyal and continually growing following. Unless you're completely uninterested in small unit tactics, [b]ASL[/b] is one of those wargames you should experience at least once in your life.

Kudos to MMP for making ASL 'easy' for newbies to get into. However, if you want a similar (but perhaps easier) wargaming experience, I'd suggest going for Combat Commander.

RATING: 7.5
early rating after the first scenario (no SWs). i suspect my rating will rise as further scenarios add more gameplay. 

first off, getting started isn't *that* difficult. i've enjoyed games with much steeper learning curves and repeated rules-parsing (eg, War of the Ring, Bonaparte at Marengo). a tremendous help is to watch Joe Steadman's SK tutorials in tandem while reading the rules and charts.

i do wish, however, that the designers could develop a more-atomic SK ruleset to help ease rules-finding. i would gladly buy that. (eg, try finding some relevant tidbit in the wall-of-text that is the Movement Phase or Close Combat Phase. i have the complete SK rules that are included in EP1 and dread the thought of looking up rules in that.)

i initially started off with EP1 because SK1 was OOP. EP1 was a little too much, too soon, and i considered picking up the streamlined Retro variant to use the ASL components right away. 

i did have my hand-crafted Valor & Victory to play as alternative. V&V is a great intro to squad-level gaming. and it was V&V that lead me to ASL. 

i wanted a taste of the real thing, what people call "the queen-mother" of wargames. 

if SK1 provides that taste, then sign me up for more! the level of detail is about right. i don't mind the machinations that make for longer turns. i like detail at the squad level. ASLSK1 gives a similar narrative as you might find in interviews with or writings by combat vets. as it's often said, no battle plan survives the first shot fired. combat is chaotic. crazy things happen. and, ironically, there's often tint of dark-humor.

just in this small intro scenario, i saw a group of German conscripts wipe out a stack of American elites in close combat only to be later routed by a second wave of GIs. While in another building, a squad of German conscripts overcame overwhelming odds after four rounds of close combat & melee to win the scenario. American leaders separated from their squads by why-the-heck-not long-odds area fire. Germans desperate to hold onto a building getting caught in an ambush. 

i'm a miniatures player; i usually find counters to be less immersive. but this game delivers the promise of the small package. you peek around corners to see if you have a shot (or get shot at). you pray that your smoke cover will be enough as you cross open ground. you hold fire and watch the enemy approach. closer ... closer ... now! you make rumbling rifle sounds with your mouth while throwing the dice. 

and when the dust settles and victory is decided, it all fits neatly and easily back into a 1-inch counter tray and printer-paper-sized box.

Great, fun wargame to help an beginning ASLer get the ropes down.  This is still complex as you read the rulebook.  Look on BGG for rules tutorials as they will make everything much easier!

I also own the Starter Kit #2, Starter Kit #3, Decision at Elst, Beyond the Beaches, and Expansion Pack #1.

Ridiculously complicated, ridiculously detailed, a ridiculously rich experience. Taking days to punch all the rules into my head, but in the meantime, falling in love more and more. The combat system is really dynamic, with both players getting their share of the gripping action, while the answer to "Who's winning?" jumps from side to side. 
The Starter kit #1 is a good and cheap choice to get yourself familiar with the ASL system. If you decide it was not your slice of cake, it didn't cost a fortune. If it hits you big time, it will cost you a fortune (with the zillion modules).

But hey guys...what's up with NO TURN MARKER in a starter kit?

Probably the best way to learn how to play ASL.  This is a great stand-alone game in its own right.  It replaces Paratrooper as the first contact many will have with ASL.  This is far better.  Keep in mind it is just infantry vs. infantry.  No tanks, no infantry guns, no airplanes.  Just infantry with a few support weapons.

As an old ASL fan, this is a really cool game that has gotten back into ASL.  I cannot say how much I enjoy this game.  I will say that I can imagine this would be hard to learn for the average player but comming from ASL this is like learning to play Candyland.

Fine introduction to the system. Play it with those friends whom, while they like the tactical scale, don't want to take the whole ASL journey. You'll find all ASL basics here, and maybe you won't feel the need to try full ASL. Anyhow, this is a good place to start. Take a deep breath and build upon it. It's a very rewarding system if tactical scale is what you like.

My rating of the ASL Starter Kits rises progressively, although I consider the whole effort a solid 8.

This is how I learned to play ASL. The rulebook alone is difficult to digest for a newbie, but there is a wealth of tutorials, player aids and friendly ASLers to get you started. I love how nothing has to be unlearned when transitioning to "full" ASL, you just add on new concepts

Unbelievable that you can have so much fun with just basic infantry rules. It's easy to learn and it pushed me further to full ASL. But it isn't just an introduction to full ASL, it's a great game on its own!

RATING: 8.5
Despite concerns about the well-known complexity of any version of Advanced Squad Leader, I convinced a friend of mine to dive into Starter Kit #1 with me.  I spent about 5 hours with the 12 page rule book, which is incredibly dense and loaded with cryptic acronyms and abbreviations, though most of what it represents is logical, if not easy to recall in the heat of battle.

The first thing that hit me was how much of this game is based on morale.  A LOT of this very complicated system revolves around the motivations and mental state of your soldiers, both broken or unbroken.  As an author and screenwriter who always thinks about motivations for characters, this continual focus on the mental well being of the soldiers immediately distinguished this system from some of the others I’ve played.

Also compelling is how risky offensive gambles can turn disastrously wrong—defenders are not limited to a single action if the attacker is aggressive enough, so the system almost never settles down and becomes “safe” for an opponent the way that it does in something like Conflict of Heroes nor is it locked by activation cards as it is in something like Battle Cry.  Even better is how unclear the Line of Sight can be to the player---a shot can be blocked by less than millimeter and you won’t know it until you’ve stretched thread across the board and sent the lead to no avail.

A few bits of chrome stand out as a little clunky to me at this stage. In particular, it seems like most of the time soldiers will not move via Assault Movement, so instead of very, very, very regularly applying a -1 for First Fire Non Assault Movement, it would be simpler to rebalance the statistic and just add a +1 for the few times that AM is used.  Maybe the experienced grognard uses Assault Movement all the time, but it wasn’t so in my limited experience thus far.

Other than FFNAM and a couple of other things, this incredibly sophisticated system details the tactics and mindset of squad level combat and is a more “ground level experience” than most of the other war games that I’ve enjoyed because of its complexity. The fluid and shifting interplay of the combat in this system, the casualty reduction of the units, cowering, residual fire, low crawling, and especially the leader promotion system are great details that put you down in the dirt.

This Starter Kit is worth the effort, but requires a lot of time to absorb—not because it is unclear, but because there are exceptions piled on top of exceptions that exist within exceptions and such a sophisticated interplay in things like Defensive First Fire phase. Oxymoronic terms like Subsequent First Fire don't make things any easier.

I expect to play this iteration for a while, but have already ordered Starter Kit #2, downloaded a guide on transitioning from ASLSK to full ASL, and purchased the full rules for when I want to add more to a game that is already complex, vivid, and engrossing in its simplest incarnation.

Great introduction to a great game system. Missing too much from the full-blown ASL rules to make it a great stand-alone game.

After one play I will hold off on judgement.  I see where the appeal is, but I am not sure if it is right for me.  I like prcedural games, but this one seems to drag a bit considering the turns are supposed to represent like 2 minutes of actual time. I can only imagine the full game would bog down even more.  I appreciate what it is and I have nothing against the system, I just don't know if it works for me.  I don't 'need' the realism or the depth so Combat Commander really works a lot better for me.  It has a much more believable tempo for what is trying to represent and I like the chaos management of it as that feals more 'real' to me.

This is the game that will revitalize ASL.  New grognards like me who have been looking for a way to get into ASL will find the starter kits to be a godsend.  Great scenarios, played with a guy that had never wargamed anything before, and he picked it up quick.  Can hardly wait for the next kit.

Clearly a precursor to Tide of Iron. After giving this a shot I really appreciate the genre, although I'd probably rather play Tide of Iron for more streamlined rules and shear fun.

While the rulebook is a definite improvement on getting people to actually PLAY Advanced Squad Leader, my chief complaint is that with just a bit more work (and a teacher who has already waded into the full rulebook and returned to tell the tale), you could be actually playing FULL ASL.  At the point, with the system including guns, tanks, campaign games, and more, I think it should mainly be used as a jumping off point rather than an end in itself.  And really, aside from snipers and concealment, 98% of the rules you use the most in ASL are already here.

Update Sept 2016 - Haven't played this in years. Combat Commander and other GMT games is about as heavy as my group can go.

Got this to the table after owning it for 9 months. The amount of rules acts as a hindrance. The game was enjoyable and I would definitely want to play again. Would have to read the rulebook again though.

RATING: 9.5
The only flaw with this game is that condensing the whole mass of the ASL infantry rules into 12 pages leaves a few ambiguities in various edge cases that really can't be resolved without the real ASL rule book and/or expert guidance. Otherwise, this is a phenomenal introduction into an absolutely incredible game, and the price is unbeatable.

A nice intro to ASL games marred by a rule book designed for those already into the game.  Instead of getting me excited about the game, it actually turned me away from further ASL puchases.  Not user friendly. (Comments for first edition). Repurchased this with the 2014 re-release which updated the rules, improving it a bit. I'll give it another go but don't think I'll ever be an ASL aficionado.

A few days prior to 12/11/16:  I'm not much of a war gamer, so these rules are hard for me.  I am putting some effort in, however, and I am determined to get this to the table soon.  

12/11/16:  A rough game one is in the books.  I really had a good time.  Some unlucky dice roles forced my opponent into a frustrated submission before game end, but he isn't deterred.  We are playing again soon.  The game is rich and detailed and even at this level I think, "wow, they thought of everything."  I can't even begin to imagine the depth of full ASL  I'll have an update again soon.  

12/23/16:  My fascination with this game continues to grow.  I am now four games in and we just tried our fist game with support weapons.  I will continue to play and learn this game for quite a while.  It may not surpass my most played games (currently Hanabi and X-Wing) simply due to game length, but I do know ASL will cut into those two games. 

12/24/17: It has been about a year since I started into the ASLSK journey. The game has settled for me. I am no longer obsessed, but it is still a game I enjoy playing. I am not very good at it, which probably deters me a bit. (An ASL loss can be a rough loss). I still haven't stepped out beyond SK1, but the additions in the second starter kit do seem very interesting. If I played this game six times a year, I would be happy.

The 2 half-squads pulled me over with a fine introduction. I have played SL and liked it. I have played ASL and gasped at all of the bore-sighting, kindling and whatever that made it into a ruleslawyers wet dream. ASLSK is amazing to the extent as to what they have crammed into that tiny rulebook. The only thing I miss is the concealment rule (which would not have been to hard to add). And the hills on the mapboards, who of course gets into the equation in ASLSK 2. Great job altogether! Magnificent gateway into ASL, even if I will not go all the way.

I have to agree with Russ Gifford’s assessment of October War . . . this is just about as good as it gets for modern tactical games. Sure, there are a few holes in the rules, and a stickler might moan about this or that, but October War really got the basics RIGHT.

Like the best SPI games of its era 'October War' has tremendous bang for the buck.  The system is easy to assimilate and plays smoothly while capturing the tactics, techniques, and tools of combat at this scale in the 1973 Arab Israeli war.  

True there's a lot of die rolling once units start accruing 'disruptions', but the system captures a great deal with its approachable rule set.  We've enjoyed replaying the same scenarios with differing plans as our techniques become more refined.  

It's truly a loss to the hobby that more theaters weren't explored with this system.  I plan on getting Mechwar '77 and playing with October War's rules.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Interesting and satisfying treatment of the 73 war at the tactical level -- units take vehicle/squad losses which impact their ability to move/fight through both degradation and increased likelihood of "panic".  Very interactive sequence of play.  The biggest problem is the use of a single map in a multi-battle tactical level game system, so really there's not much to complain about.  Overall much better system than its contemporary competitor Arab-Israeli Wars, but unfortunately not given the same treatment of scope and variety.

It looks like it hangs together as a simulation, and the panic rules look like they provide some imperative human effects, but modern tactical games of the type requiring reference to multiple matrices to take a shot just aren't my cup of tea. In some ways, it's unfair to have me rate a tactical armor game, but I gotta be me. I will say, though, that I wish the time I lavished thirty years ago on [b]Panzer Battles[/b], my first S&T issue, had been used on this instead.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Great game with much improved Mech War 77 system, particularly Command & Control rules replacing the old "Panic" system which I had struggled with right from my first boardgame - Combined Arms.

Lots of different vehicle variants unseen in other theatres of war - Centurions, Sherman Jumbos etc.

Good looking map and excellent scenarios, shame it was constrained by magazine format so no geomorphic boards.

RATING: 5
Attempted to redefine platoon-level tactical armored combat and provided a good system to do so, particularly WRT individual vehicle losses.  Colorfully produced but the OOB and situations felt a bit too vanilla, especially when compared to its rival, THE ARAB ISRAEL WARS by Avalon Hill.  Still, this was one of the more successful S&T issue games for the old SPI "Golden Age."

RATING: 8.3
 Got it Jan/2014. This game is shocking to me. Strip away moral rules,air power & artillery and the Egyptians & Syrians are the better armed force! Shocking , this game has changed my whole view of what happened in 1973. I sit in awe of IDF & Israeli command.
This GAME is a example of why I play war-games. It takes me beyond what pages and media can convey.

Last of the the Kampfpanzer/Desert War/P44/M77 subset. Rules worked well backfitted to earlier games, although the counters in this one had different and stated to be more accurate numbers than MW77. 

Have two copies/sets of couters to play scenarios from later MW2-Suez to Golan using this system on StoG maps.

The best of the SPI tactical armor games. Excellant balance of detail and playability. The step reduction works to give a feel for combat, while the panic rules provide the Fog of War. One down side is that one has to roll for panic before firing or even moving most units, a drag in larger scenarios

My favorite tactical armor game - features step losses, a then-novel interleaved sequence of play and a third "protected" armor class.  The main disadvantages are the magazine format - it needs another map or two, rules for helicopters and combat engineers, and few hundred more counters.  In other words, it needs the scope of Arab-Israeli Wars with the system of October War.

RATING: 8
A pleasant surprise.  Played this first in 2004. Some mechanisms are a bit archaic but overall a good game and good history.  The only thing we found that needed reining in were the missile rules - early or late depletion can completely swing a scenario either way, and we also found that overall, missiles seem to be a bit too powerful for the era, so we're putting a cap on the total number of fires per missile unit.

It's too bad that this was not expanded to cover all the Arab-Israeli wars.  It puts the much cruder system of the contemporary Avalon-Hill game to shame.

Played during my interest in the Yom Kippur war. Generally play operational level games rather than tactical.This didn't do much for me.

A good, solid game with enough "chrome" to be interesting but not overwhelming (looking at you, Mech War 2).  Its biggest problem is the limitations of being a magazine game with relatively limited counter mix (such as the necessary, but missing, Smoke markers) and one map.


Fortunately, it's fairly common and I have two copies with the intention of getting another one or two so that I can use the spare maps to make up some new configurations.

Probably the pinnacle of development for the PanzerBlitz system. The balance of detail and playability seemed as close in this game as it ever would get. Beyond this, MechWar 2, bogged us down in excess complexity. Tactical armored combat, during the '73 war at the platoon level. Nice counters and one of the nicest maps for a game of this type to date. Got rid of the simove plotting and introduced an integrated turn, that worked much better than I thought it would. Also replaced disruption states with a step loss system, and added rules for a campaign game (a-whaa?!). One other nice feature, for a game mixer like me, was that the Mech War '77 (and so too the Panzer '44) counters were compatible, so I was able to expand some homemade scenarios. IMHO the SPI guys could have stopped right here and filled in the blanks for other theaters and eras.

I'm not a big "modern" fan when it comes to land battles (naval is a different kettle of fish) but October War--which I obtained by buying a huge collection of S&T's from a gentleman who wanted to "simplify" his later years--turned out to be a real exception. It plays relatively swiftly, is interesting in its interactions between the two sides in the four scenarios I've played, and while is easy to play is not easy to master. This one will remain in my game library.

There are some interesting challenges here. The semi co-op game and metagame is what makes this title different, and better than just another simple-bordering-on-simplistic game.

But I'll still play [i]Shadows over Camelot[/i] or [i]Pandemic[/i] before it.

RATING: 6.5
This is an early Wallace design and it shows in the style of game play.  Play is more linear and less choices are offered each turn, but even so play is enjoyable.  The theme is not tightly coupled to the game, but it is worked into the overall feel of the game.  I liked playing the game, but don't see why the rating is as low as it is.  Perhaps it is being judged in contrast to later designs.

An early Martin Wallace design without the depth of the later titles.  Our first game finished very quickly due to one player rolling well on row three and spending all their money on houses.  Board and cover look nice, a big improvement on the white box edition and published for a good cause.

A great free-riding game where you have to balance building your estate with holding back your opponents and weighing in to defeat Mordred. As is typical for a Wallace game, you can either bet on an Arthur or a Mordred victory, which gives some nice opportunities for alternative strategies. I play this a lot with my kids, who kinda like it.

A very weird Martin Wallace game that (at least to our group) is incredibly funny to play. You roll dice each turn after picking a row on a table. The roll and row you pick will tell you how much money you get to build structures each turn as well as how many Mordred Men go onto the board and how many spaces you have to move back on a track. There is risk involved as Column C gives the most money but can add the most men and move you the furthest back. You would need to see this in action to see why it is so funny. Just embrace the chaos and enjoy the ride. Highly recommended.

Fun press-your-luck game with an interesting game mechanic. Greed is your true enemy. Can Knights of the Round Table work together and win the war for Arthur? Hell no!! It plays fast and people who can't appreciate the irony in this one need to play more games. "If it's not Wallace it's Crap!"
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun game with simple yet interesting choices.  Mordred needs to become a factor in order to make the game interesting; else it is a race to build as much and as fast as possible, with the difference being the luck of dice rolls.  Once he's in people's faces, though, the choices open up and the game becomes a lot of fun.

Group think uniquely affects this game, in a good way.  Some games are over very quickly because everyone races to build and Mordred never becomes a factor, while in others players avoid helping Mordred a lot and the game can drag on a bit.  Somewhere in between is the ideal.  The variety in experiences with different players is great.

The unbalanced board allows for one strategy, building towns along the southern coast, to be very strong -- Mordred cannot reach in time to stop them.  Other players must pay the one-pound tax to get down there as well to keep that player from running away with the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A fun game that forces players to walk a tightrope between cooperative and selfish game-play. Tactical play considerations are: improving your immediate position by building high-value but defensively weak buildings; building low-value but offensively strong fortifications; and employing the non-player Mordred and his army in reducing these among your opponents.

I like the idea behind varying victory condition, however it seemed to drag the game a little because no one wants to make that final push to trigger the endgame. Also a little disappointing that there is not any 2 player variant inside of the game.

RATING: 5
Quick and light unless all players are trying to keep everything in balance in which case it might go on for quite some time. If someone pursues a risky strategy they can easily give the game to whoever has helped Mordred the least.

RATING: 7
Rules say 3-4 players, but my younger son and I have found it to be fine as a 2 player game.  Remember that Mordred's men are very useful for knocking your opponent's pieces off the board if he's going to win by using up his small houses.  I found this out the hard way, and now my son is grounded.

This is a fun, very light-weight wargame.  In typical Wallace fashion, there are a few roads to victory.  Has some push-your-luck elements in gambling on getting money vs. aiding the dark forces a little too much.  But it feels very tightly interconnected and well designed.  I'm sort of surprised it's ranked as low as it is.

RATING: 8
What an original game!  12 plays... (1x2p, 2x3p, 9x4p). Mordred killed (Isle of Anglesey taken) only once out of the 12 plays! And he beat Arthur's disputatious knights at least three times...  Unusual game with a strong element of Prisoner's Dilemma mixed with risk taking and Euro VP building and multiple paths to victory...  Good, quick, easy, clever game with lots of decisions around unusual cross-currents of need, with a bunch of luck, cooperation, competition, bitterness, and gnashing of teeth. In fact I find it addictive - played it multiple times in a row more than one occasion. Sometimes it's quite difficult to make progress... You pay and fight to clear a path, and finally succeed! yay! so you can build there next turn.  But no, someone else's greed and bad morality easily fills up that space with Mordred Men. You build a castle, someone else immediately directs Mordred Men to attack it. In that sense I think the Prisoner's Dilemma relations between the players tends even stronger in Mordred's favor. Players become annoyed by the disincentive to confront Mordred, and in a spirit of revenge, help him attack other players.... Bickering, the knights of Arthur ruin their king's standing in Wales; the Mordred Men in Black march across the map; situation sinks rapidly until Mordred's near victory leads the now-chastened players to cooperate again. Relatedly, I've found that I don't always play merely to win, but also to fight Mordred. When players cooperate, they can stop Mordred, and slowly push him back. And so whether they cooperate or not, if I choose to go after Mordred instead of founding villages, I can feel frustrated by the vulnerability of that strategy to other players who benefit by my action. How can virtue survive? If played to win, I think it could suffer a little from the implicit requirement to count and recount players' point status for optimal play. And I was thinking about an extra track to keep account of that. But I see someone here has already uploaded something to do that. So--Good! Due to the Dilemma, I think this game would play differently with different game group personalities. As I try to sort out how I feel about this usual and original game, I find the experience, easy, hard, problematic, brilliant, fun, annoying, and addictive.  Also it's fun to see your fellow players slip on the morality track "just like in real life".

RATING: 7
This one requires more thoughtfulness in your choices than will appear at first blush. Maybe that's a hallmark of Martin Wallace games.

For a short-playing, lighter Wallace game with a bit of luck involved, this one really hits a good balance. There are multiple avenues to take.  I like the alternate winning conditions based on group behavior (see Liberte for example). In contrast to Liberte, this game allows you to play it more quickly.  

The theme is pretty thin, and doesn't really hold up that well...other than the sense that you're getting invaded by badguys. I think Tinners Trail and Mordred are the two short/lightish Wallace games I'd recommend as family games.

RATING: 7
This is an interesting game. It seems like it would be totally luck based at first, but after 3 plays a lot of interesting things happened. Group think and "bash the perceived leader" seem to play a huge role, and there are definitely a few interesting paths to victory. Pleasantly surprised by this one.

RATING: 4
Mordred roughly amounts to gamer's type filler. The core engine of the game involves rolling dice which give money that is used to erect buildings and attack Mordred. There are three payout tracks to choose from, and the ones that offer the most money also offer the largest chance of having to place Mordred's lackeys onto the board. The tension in the game surrounds the end game: if Mordred wins by having more of a presence on the board than the players, then the goal is simply to have helped him the least. If Arthur wins, then the goal is to have placed the most victory point buildings onto the board. During the game players roll the bones, put up buildings, and generally take hacks at the lackeys who stray too close to their military garrisons. Meanwhile, the valuable town pieces, which are easy pickings for the lackeys, are stacked up behind the outposts. When one is forced to place Mordred pieces, they're often used to harass the other players at the table, and ideally, to trash their towns which makes it harder for them to win if Arthur wins the game.

Overall, there is some tension about how you want the game to end, and there are some interesting decisions that spring out of that, but mostly about how hard to go for it on the money track, where the dice can screw you early and often. The roll a single die and see what happens combat, and the roll 2 dice and see how much money you get system are both inherently random to the extreme and I think they will determine the winner in this game more times than not. The money roll in particular is huge because access to money is crucial to both build VP buildings, and to attack the lackeys, which are the two ways you can win the game. It's clearly an older design, and I can see the charm, but I don't see myself playing this all too often; the central hook justifies a play or two, but the actual game in practice is not as compelling as the original concept would make one think. Another game that I started out mildly positive about, but which slid quickly when it was revisited. Another play would likely push it down further because there just isn't enough going on here for me to justify investing the time.

One play - not a typical Wallace game in that it can be very short ... honestly if it had come in at the typical 2-3 hours for one of his games I don't know if it gets a second play, because it came across as being about the dice rolls more than anything else ... but at 30 minutes it certainly packed a lot of decisions and thinking into a half hour.  Could go up or down.  We'll see.

Interesting design that takes a bit of work to get you head around the rules.  Once you do, you see a very simple game that has many paths to victory.  However, dice still play largely into the final result, however; the game plays fast so it doesn't matter.

Just couldn't get myself or others interested in this one enough to keep it in my collection.

Two of my gaming groups played with the wrong rules for a while. Be sure to roll BOTH dice when determining Pounds / Mordred Men. This is a very interesting game. The multi-axis balances gives this game a lot of reactions and implications for each decision you make. Not a brain-burner, but the finely balanced see-saw makes it fun to think through the consequences, take risks and see if they pan out, or play it safe and make some cash.

RATING: 7
Clever game where good and evil fight it out, while players must constantly take sides... or switch sides! It all depends on how the other players are also doing in meeting the good or evil goals, as well as how good and evil are doing on the map at the time.

The only flaw here is heavy luck that can blow the best plans out of the water with no way to recover.

RATING: 6
Considering some of Wallace's other offerings, I can see how some might be disappointed by a lighter game.  At first when you play it, it doesn't seem to offer much in the way of strategy and yes, the dice play a huge role.  As the game progresses you can see the balance of helping or hindering Mordred depending on what your opponents build and how you fare on the Mordred 'virtue' track.  I think this ended up being quite good for a lighter game and it plays quickly and is quite different from other games I own.  The artwork in the latest edition is quite nice as well.

Opinion based on a single play.  A game I wanted to like but which has disappointed me so far.  The presentation of the reprint edition, and the mechanics of the game seem like they ought to provide a fun gaming experience, but for some reason they just don't.  The game that we played bogged down quickly leaving players without much to do but wait until they had enough cash to take a few meaningful actions.  It might be that we missed something, but I'll have a job convincing people to get it to the table again since it wasn't much fun and there are many other far more enjoyable games out there.

The bits are nice enough, better than those from other warfrog games.Mordred is a too simple game of luck, yet its victory conditions and points counting does not make a good family game.It can be funny on occasion, if not taken seriously at all; playing while slightly intoxicated is the way to go.This all may sound harsh as the benefits will go to a charity - that is the reason I bought it, and as such it is certainly better than a charity Monopoly.

This isn't the typical weuro, and it isn't his typical euro either; it is a simplified weuro, perhaps.

Roll for and take money- if needed, place Mordred's henchmen (smashing the rivals, if possible)- spend the money (in attcking Mordred, or building over the rubble of your rivals, perhaps).

A light, quick Wallace game, but the decision making involved is fairly trivial. The only real decision is which money track to roll against and there's a huge variance in the amount received. After that the game's just a question of checking what you can afford, a building or a few attacks. It all ends quickly enough, but there are much better games in this time frame.

Very interesting combination of simple dice-rolling area control (a la Risk) with Euro-style 'action point' management.

This was the game that was so highly anticipated?  Really?  I don't think I'll ever play this game again; it's very random and at the end I found I didn't really care about the end game conditions, so long as one of them was triggered so I could play something else.  I'll stick to Brass.

RATING: 7
Light and quick-playing for a Martin Wallace game. The differing victory conditions are a nice Wallace touch and allow a bit of strategy in an otherwise fun filler game.

The current (2007) re-release is produced to same decent standards as other recent Warfrog games, with a colourful and attractive board and nice wooden pieces.

After two plays, I doubt that I'll ever play this again... other than for a filler.

Roll low dice... you lose.  Roll high dice, you might have a chance... as long as the other players are rolling the same.

The different types of units don't seem to make much sense, and the fact that you have to pay to attack and pay to build while "Mordred" gets everything for free makes the game VERY lobsided.  He can attack AND gain a space in one go.

Conceivably, in a 4 player game, Mordred can have four expansions before you can react between turns... not balanced at all!

Mordred reminds me of Avalon Hill's old Amoeba Wars, including the possible 'turtling' for a big push win... only I'd rather be playing Amoeba Wars... it was more fun.

Wow... another Martin Wallace game that totally misses the mark.  I think that I'd rather play "Secrets of the Tombs."

RATING: 7
Game plays as expected - fast, but brainburning.  I want to like it more, but will need a few more plays to bump it up.  Every turn has tough decisions - which money track?  place mordred men or attack fellow players?  what buildings to build where?

RATING: 6.5
Decent game for what it is.  Luck does play a part via the dice rolling, but doesn't consume the game which is good.  Quality of the game is pretty poor but still fun none the less.  Nice quick Euro.

20.5.2008: It's a bit hard to understand at first, not the rules but the tactics. Very dice heavy, but it plays fast and you still have control over what you buy and attack. Quite confrontational, which I like.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Based on 1 play. Players take turns by choosing an income track and rolling dice to determine their income and placement of Mordred lackeys. The higher paying track is more likely to produce lackeys. Dice rolling in important since you need cash to build and if you roll poorly not only do you not make much money, you place more Mordred lackeys, and to top it all off you move back along the Mordred track(which is bad). Ultimately, the game seemed rather uninteresting and decisions seemed to be pretty straight forward.

RATING: 6
In Mordred, a great strategic approach can be ruined by bad dice rolls. If that doesn't immediately turn you off, then you'll find a game that exploits a fine balance between cooperating with your fellow knights against the men of Mordred while positioning yourself for the win. There are two victory conditions - one if the Mordred men take Wales and another if they don't. Once you figure out where your best chances lie, manipulating the board to your advantage creates some interesting situations choosing which players to help or hurt - and when to time the ending of the game.

The new version of Mordred has very nice components and appears to be much more attractive than the initial release.  I like how the game plays (relatively) quickly and how big of a factor greed can be.  I love greed/press-your-luck type games, and this one integrates that concept in a pretty fresh way.  The game is probably best played without thinking too much, since the fun gets sucked out when it starts taking too long.  It seems like there are a variety of strategies that could work.  I look forward to future plays.

RATING: 6
One of those games where players are both working together and against each other. A bit like Terra or Cutthroat. Its short enough to be interesting, although the game is so random that I'm not sure there is much skill or strategy to it.

I'd liken it to a mini-wargame with random payouts. If there was a better combat system I think I'd like this game a bit more.

We played it three times.  Twice while we waited fo someone to arrive, and once more after our big game.  We laughed, we groaned.  It's a dice game.  It plays in 30 minutes or so.  As a filler it is fun.  As long as your players are on board for a wargame, this is fast friendly and fun.  But it is a dice game, so don't expect some major strategy game.

Ultimately, I decided I didn't need this for my collection.  A game I will play and enjoy if someone produces it, asking to play.  But not one I will ask for, and thus one I don't need for the collection.

In my grand opening of my gameroom this was one of the games I played for the first time and won. I'm not sure how much luck is involved. There definately is some. But you can win on both sides. or have a strong position there. There is possibly some king making.

"And that's it, that's the game.  Nothing terribly deep, just roll the dice and see what happens.  The game should last around half an hour, so if you are still playing after two hours the chances are you are doing something horribly wrong."

Unfortunately, [i]playing to win[/i] seems to be an example of "doing something horribly wrong."  The game is short & light when playing with young children, but in my one game with my brothers, it [i]did[/i] last two hours, and would have gone longer if one of us hadn't deliberately thrown the game just to end it.  (And it's not that we were playing slowly; it was that we would, you know, [i]take steps to keep each other from winning.)[/i]  Maybe we would try different strategies which would make the game go more quickly next time, but I really doubt I will be able to get those guys to try it again.

Update: as an experiment, tried this with my regular group; OK, it [i]is[/i] possible for the game to end in 30 minutes if everyone is playing to win... but only if the dice hose you all, ha ha ha.

Update: traded to Ricomaurer 2009-04-14.

Played once, 4 players.  This was a fairly straightforward game of screw the leader - if you can.  The victory points are constantly in flux, and at a certain time in the game, maybe become totally worthless.  There are some strategic decisions to make, but this could turn into a long drawn out game of back and forth of the same move.  I would play again, but I'm not aching to.

This is a dicefest, Martin Wallace filler.  It will likely take around 20-30 minutes to play.  Some interesting choices do exist in how much to risk, but quite often the luck of the dice will take a significant chunk out of your best laid plans.  If you cannot handle that, don't bother playing.

The theme was what first made me want this game.  I love the Arthurian legends, so this became kind of a 'must-have.'  However, upon playing the theme becomes as thin as most Wallace games.  It's much easier to teach and learn than I thought, and the dice mechanic is rather mundane, leading to very little excitement throughout the game.
The board is quite nice, and the player's pieces are colorful but not well thought out.  I think the look would be much improved by pieces that actually look like castles, instead of the overly-thick columns that look too large for the board.
It's a decent filler, though, as it plays rather quickly.  That fact alone should be enough to keep it in rotation for awhile.

I don't get the high rating other than from Hopeless Wallace Fanboys. This is another half finished game from Mr Wallace. 
It is 100% dice rolling, not in and of itself a bad thing, but I fail to see where there is any real strategy in the play. It lacks the tension of other pure dice games like can't stop.   luckily it is quick, but that doesn't make up for it just being boring.

Fun. [01/22/2008] After another couple plays, knocking this up a half-notch.

What a great cause - promoting Organ donor donations and giving the proceeds to charity.  Kudos to the entire Warfrog team! The game itself is pretty light and has quite a bit of luck.  In theory, I love the three different end game conditions. All the games I have played ended the same way - with Mordred winning the war and the person highest on the chivalry track winning, and with repeated play I seldom see this changing.  Not the most exciting game but for a filler it works ok.  Other dice games fill this niche much better. On my trade pile.

After playing it, I want it more. 'Easy' and quick Wallace. Probably plays well with 3 as well. Love the different end conditions.

Update: got it in a trade!

After 4 games: I like the concept of the game. As usual with an early Wallace it's not so smoothed out as his current Treefrog games. Games can turn out short or long, agressive or cooperative, depending on groupthink and dicerolls. Enjoyable game overall. One of those 4 session ran a bit too long, really should be played in an hour max. It's more a gamer's game than appears on first sight.

Unique and fairly abstract game where each player (knight) is fighting together to defeat the game system (Mordred) while competing with each other.  There are a few strategies one can take (read the summary for VP conditions).

RATING: 7
A relatively simple design from Martin Wallace. Doesn't pretend to be more than it is, which is a standard Euro with simple movement rules that plays out quickly enough to match its relative simplicity. 

There aren't that many rules, but it IS Martin Wallace, so there are several small ones to keep in mind, plus once one plays using all the rules, it's obvious there is much more to the strategy to this game than first appears, so as that becomes apparent, so too does the value of the game rise. 

Also, if players choose to playing nastily (removing others' pieces via employing the Mordreds) big-time screwage can ensue. 

I can rate it a "7" because it's easy to learn, offers many choices and can play out in many ways. The wooden bits are tight, too. As for theme, I don't see any: "Mordred" could be about anything, but the board's an attractive map of Wales, including Anglesey, which I, my wife, and our youngest son have visited. 

Acquired by trade, October 2008. Sold in February of 2011, not because I didn't like it, but because it didn't appeal to my family, plus the buyer was willing to basically pay what I was asking for it.

Lightweight game of variable length. I like the assymetric goals and end conditions. The weight of luck will likely determine your strategy and your success with it, but decent groan and cheer inducing events will lend fun along the way for those who don't take it too seriously.

RATING: 5
Too much of a tightrope walk to be much fun.  If someone takes a southern build VPs fast approach, someone has to take it on the chin to go down there and sic Mordred on that someone.  Fits within the theme, I suppose, but I just don't find the game much fun.  Math traded.

RATING: 3
I am not sure why this game is being praised at all. It is really bad. The mechanics are terrible and don't even make sense. It cost money to fight the Mordred Men, but anyone can attack you for free. Sure, you must balance based on the two different winning conditions, but even so, makes for a very boring game. In my opinion, it was reprinted just because of the name on the box. On top of that, it is very ugly (board and pieces).

I like it a lot, in spite of the incessant dice rolling.  I like the nebulous, or globular flow of areas on the board. It is very hard to predict the direction, let alone the shape, of the board in future turns.  Plus it is Martin Wallace in 45 minutes!

Not quite sure why this was reprinted. It seems badly outdated, like most of Martin Wallace's games from the turn of the century. Far too much dice rolling - roll for income, roll for Mordred, roll for attacks...excessive, especially if your game drags to an hour. Wildly unpredictable. Your buildings can be virtually wiped out in a couple of turns. This is fine if the game was more fun, but it outstayed its welcome.

RATING: 6
An interesting little game, perhaps let down by looking more serious than it is: this is dice and player-interaction chaos in a shortish time frame. Provided players are forewarned as to what to expect, they should have a good time.  With competent play, the game should always be at risk of ending with the victory swinging to Arthur or Mordred on a knife-edge. There may be too much power in hoarding one's earnings until surging at the right moment as a structure not on the board can not be destroyed, however your buildings will eventually need to stand a full turn, and that is a long time in a game like Mordred... Accessible fun that is unlike any other game. UPDATE: we now limit hoarding to a maximum of 20 coins to force some play on the board. There seems a risk of it going forever but that has not happened yet, though it has run close to an hour once which was a bit too long.

--Dec2007-- Strange pseudo-light balancing act.  I think if one believed it were a relative of some of Wallace's more serious dice-rolling games (Byzantium, Perikles, or Princes of the Renaissance, for example) it might seem relatively annoying.  But - it seems to me, at least - as a second cousin of Can't Stop it's really quite cool.  After one play, I think I like it.  Whether anyone else I know will like it remains dubious.
--Feb2008-- Perhaps not quite so cool as I had originally thought; there's definitely a groupthink factor, and can easily take "too long."

Argh! It's almost genius! But the dice rolling irks me. Would it not make more sense if the black spots on the money table were reversed and in the high money positions? (But with half value Mordred table movement.) As is the penalty for rolling low is insurmountable. Get a tiny income and rocket up the Mordred track. Roll all ones and twos for several turns in a row and see how much fun you're having. Meanwhile players rolling fives and sixes are laughing it up, building castles, attacking Mordred and having a hoot when they roll low and get to stomp over the other players. And why not - that's how it should be for all the players. It strikes me that players could nominate A, B or C rows and then there could be a communal roll applying to all players to the round, but what would be the fun in that? I don't have a perfect solution, but I do know there's an excellent dice game in here... somewhere.

Next game I'm just building a big money pile and coming storming out onto he board in a flurry of building activity and Mordred attacking fury.

Although luck can play a significant role in this game, it is complex and the scores at the end of the game I played were very close.

It is amazing how poor the quality of this game is.  The graphic design is just downright awful, I can't believe that thought that it was ok to release like this.

That said it is quite good.  There are a number of fun decisions as you want to get points to spend on yourself but you don't want Mordred points, conversely, it isn't so bad to get Mordred as it gives you a chance to wipe out your "friends".

Not exactly your typical Martin Wallace experience, but instead, it's Martin Wallace meets dicefest.  There are multiple ways the game ends and multiple means to acquire your money (with different levels of risk), which make for some interesting decisions and elevate it above true randomness.  The other plus is that the good combat buildings don't give the most victory points, so there's some interesting tradeoffs there.  It's a very easy game to learn and play, and is a nice change of pace, but certainly nothing jaw-dropping.

RATING: 6.5
It's a pretty simple game: pick a row on the table, roll 2 d6 and earn £'s according to what's on the chart, move your token along the Mordred Track and place Mordred Men (MM) also according to the chart. Spend money to build things worth VP, or to initiate fights against adjacent MM. There are multiple end-of-game conditions. When it ends, figure out if Mordred won, or if King Arthur did. In the former case, whoever helped him the LEAST (i.e., is furthest back on the Mordred track) wins. In the latter, add up the VP values of all your builds on the board; most VP wins.

I like the game: it plays quickly and there are several ways to play it.

This is an excellent, reasonably fast game with lots of tension at multiple points in the game arc.  Although a game between new players could end in 30 minutes (ours did) once you've all played through a game it will take substantially longer as you block players and remove points while vying to increase your own.  The second game we played took almost 2 hours but that was an exciting two hours with each of the 3 of us coming within a hairs breadth of winning before being pulled back.  This game is quite light both in rules and in strategies, but it is the ultimate in 2 to 3 turn forward looking tactics.  Very very cool!

Not only can you not carry out a strategy from the get-go amongst experienced players but you may completely change your route to victory more than once.  And no player is ever completely out of the game because if you're behind, you're not a threat and the other players will be hurting each other and leaving you alone to sneak up.  Once you're not a threat, there is no benefit to continue to harass you.  Most games like this encourage picking on a weakened player because it allows acquisition of resources or some such, but this game sidesteps that problem.

We've only played 3 player games so far, and I'm wondering if the 3-way balance is important or if it's as good with 4...we'll see!

It's as good with 4.  Fast, easy, great balance and tension between all the players

2007 edition. Good theme. Colourful, mounted board. A pile of wooden bits. Great full-colour rules. Quick gameplay that demands attention to multiple end-game triggers and victory conditions. A canny player can end the game to win very, very, quickly if other players let him. Big frustrations possible if you're having a bad dice day.

Mordred is one of the lighter Wallace games, but I also think it's quite vanilla.  It works and has some neat ideas, but it felt a little plain.

I think this would be a great game to play with slightly older kids as a real gateway.  It's perfect for that situation.

Fun, quick game with some interesting strategy options.  The board and pieces could be better (especially the lack of a victory point track).

Some dice rolling with a touch of screw your neighbor.  Mildly amusing, but nothing I need to spend my money on.

I'm a big fan of Martin Wallace's game designs, and while I was aware this was lighter than his usual fare, I was anxious to give Mordred a try. A Wallace game that kept even a semblance of his typical design prowess while playing in just 45 minutes would be welcome, indeed. Sadly, while the playtime of Mordred is probably closer to half an hour for experienced players, it has sacrificed every ounce of balance, synergy, turn angst and depth that so often raise Wallace designs well above the ordinary. Luck of the dice rules in Mordred, and the game is so short that the starting player has a decided advantage. Disappointing, for sure, but even Wallace doesn't hit a home run every time at the plate, especially, it would appaer, early on in his career.

I like the simplicity of this game, and the fact that it plays well with three. It's missing the Arthurian theme I want from a game called "Mordred" -- but the mechanics are sound and it plays very quickly making it nearly a filler game.

RATING: 6
Very good, finely-balanced game with a twisted sort of competitive cooperation between players; various ways of triggering the game end combine with different ways of winning depending on whether Mordred or the players collectively have the most pieces on the board make it a bit confusing but makes for intense interaction despite the inability to directly attack each other.

Hmmmmmmmmmm I'm not too sure about this one. I want to like it because it's a quick game but there's something about it. The first thing that puts me off is the ability to not have an even number of turns in the game. There's nothing built in to balance that bit...no scaling money at the start of the game (which seems to be an obvious way to handle it to me) or even staggering the pawns on the Mordred track. I can see how you wouldn't want to force even turns but something should be there to balance it.

RATING: 7
A good game to introduce to occasional gamers. With many different "game ends" conditions to watch for, there are many different types of victories (slay Mordred, most victory points, or help Mordred the least).

Favorite rule, at the end of a series of tie breakers: "If there is still a tie then I think God meant it to be that way and the game remains tied."

There is not any depth to this game.  A quick money rush and build out of villages or towns is a short order win.  Mordred's don't really matter, as the game is too fast.  It needs something more to be fun.

A great lighter Wallace game.  The differing victory conditions help keep it interesting.  Players have several options they can pursue which has kept the games I've played lively.  

The special edition has great components.  I really love the cheeky humor in the rule book :)

for a light game this has surprising depth, colourful componants and  short play time make this a good fun filler, the production values are very high and profits went to fund the daughter of the creator's trip to the transplant games in bangkok (possibly seoul it was a long time ago since i had the e-mail disscussion with him) where she won 2 golds and a silver (though i do not know what for) for what i bought it for i also think it was good value for money, a worthy purchase for anyone, i am personally a solid  A  with occasional B column roller

The new version of the game has a very nice mounted board with nice graphics as well.  There's a whole lot of wood in the box.  A few of the rules have been tweaked but otherwise this is a nice deluxe version of the original.

RATING: 7.5
I really like this one as a short fun filler.  There's dice, there's evil, there's screwing your neighbor, and there's even a bit of strategy as well.  Not a really deep game, but different enough that it warrants a spot in the collection.

RATING: 6
There's some groupthink and counterbalancing here, but mostly there's just light (and overpriced) dicey fun.

There's also a life lesson for the unenlightened: When someone who claims to be a treacherous Arthurian knave moves in next door, put your house on the market asap.

7.6 after two playings. I quite liked this; random, yes. But I like how you decide the level of risk you're willing to take. I'd like to play some more to see if my rating goes up or down.

RATING: 6
So far I've only played practice games.  Yes, there is randomness but it seems like players will need to adapt their initial strategies to the board situation.  My worry is that it might be difficult to teach to gamers who prefer lighter games due to the different end game and victory conditions.  The components in the Valley Games edition is quite nice.My first real game went well though it was rather late in the night to be learning a new game.  I did terribly but I definitely saw that my failure was in not adapting to my frequent rolls in favor of Mordred and in poor building placement on my part.  To the south next time even if it means paying an extra gold.  The safety of my pieces far outways the extra cost.EDIT:  It seems like bad luck early in the game can force you into conservative play and difficulty in getting back into the game.

The game can actually be played by 2 players. If they strive to defeat Mordred as a team.
Have also played it solo. Task - defeat Mordred at his castle. Plays in some 15 minutes. Fun.

RATING: 8
I love the tough decisions between rolling for more money but possibly putting more of Mordred's men out (which sometimes isn't a bad thing if you use them to attack your opponents) and lowering your score on the Modred track (as long as you're not the lowest you're safe) or playing it safe but possibly falling behind in money. The 2 different end game conditions and trying to influence them to your advantage are icing on the cake.

01/27/08 - I sort of picked this up on a lark, but it really surprised me with its goodness.  This definitely fills a nice niche as a shorter, lighter, multi-player game without all the fun-concessions one must make when typically playing a euro of similar quality.

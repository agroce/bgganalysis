OK. So, this is a very cool game, no doubt. But it comes with a lot of something I really dislike... it's very luck dependent! Of course there are enough cards to minimize it, but the initial setup can cause havoc on someone's aspirations! As the gameplay is so entertaining, I'm willing to try some houserules to decrease the amount of the initial randomness that may cripple a player that only gets low dice in the beginning.

Had a really great time playing, starting from the random character generation and continuing until the very end.  Lots of fun when we had a chaotic stupid halfling cleric and a lawful good elf rogue.

Gameplay was very thinky and engaging, but the sheer number of options available at all times made my AP kick in a bit.  Scoring was very competitive at the end.

Would not be able to play with family so don't need to own, but would play again.

Roll Player is a pretty solid game with excellent graphic design. The scoring seemed nicely pre-determined such that it wasn't point salad by the end. Though many of the strategies boiled down to "plugging-in" stuff where it fit. Card and dice drafting happens a bit too few and far between to really feel as key in the game as it should. My score would be much higher if I hadn't gotten 41 points (off the charts) on my first playthrough just by doing my normal optimization thing. Apparently that's uncommon for a first playthrough so YMMV and you may get more replay value than me. Due to being a kickstarter, you'll be shelling out $60 for the pre-order right now which only contains some cards, a few punchboards, and some cheap dice. I really don't see a game of this weight being worth that price. For solo play, it's hard to beat and almost better that way rather than suffer player drafting when there's so little of it.

RATING: 7.5
Highly thematic and fun game about creating the best RPG character you can. The biggest downside is that our games ran a little long. It's not a really heavy game, it just lends itself to having players think of how to best maximize their score.

I kind of like the idea here, but the game is pretty uninspired while playing. There is basically no interaction (in general, you are worried enough with maxing your own board to worry about stealing a die that might help someone else more, and that kind of AP would stretch this to interminable lengths anyway). The expansion seems like it might introduce some more meat but still, not something I have much interest in revisiting.

I really enjoyed this more than I should have. The theme is a bonus to me, but for many it could be a huge negative. The dice placement along with the drafting of cards works well as you try to maneuver your dice into the slots that you want. There is some strategy involved as well. Rolling low in combination of certain cards can actually be a good strategy.

Brian and I played 3 new games Friday night, 9/1. First up was Roll Player. This basically simulates rolling up a D&D character. It was super fun. There is a HUGE variety in set ups as you get a class sheet, a random Alignment card, a random Backstory card and a random class card. The game revolves around taking dice each round and adding them to one of the classic D&D stats (Strength, Dexterity, etc..). As you add a die you get a special action depending on the stat it was added to. You can flip dice to their opposite face, add or subtract 1 from a die, reroll dice, etc. You can also buy cards that can give you special powers or flat out VP's for the endgame. Some cards can move your Alignment either good or bad so you need to be careful as you are trying to keep it on its highest VP square. We both really enjoyed this. It is a strength of the game that Brian absolutely doesn't like fantasy themed stuff (he had no idea about the theme of this at all) but still really enjoyed the game. I will run some solo games of this soon as I am really wanting to play it again ASAP. Probable Top 100 material.

It's a game of rolling, drafting and manipulating dice to get the numbers and patterns you want. Sounds like a super Euro and it really is... And, the thematic integration is fantastic. I'm not a fan of the theme, but I appreciate how well it fits into the game and it is a quality, little Euro game. If you like the idea of a D&D theme on a dice drafting/manipulating Euro, then this game is certainly for you.

Initial Impressions:
------------------------
I think the game is way overhyped just do to the initial kickstarter boom first off, but overall the game is fine.  Interesting decisions for sure, but I am not sure how many plays the game has before it starts to feel "samey".  Sure you change out your starting abilities, target goals and such, but I am not sure by having a +2 in Dex vs Const is really going to be enough for the game to feel different.  I wouldn't mind playing from time to time as the game is solid, but this isn't something for sure that I am itching to get to the table again soon.

I tried this game out on Tabletopia solo. I really found the solo game pretty lacking. The interesting decisions of the dice drafting and very reduced and you are really subject to a lot of randomness. Not really an interesting solo game in my eyes, but maybe it would be more interesting with more players.

This game is not for everybody. But if you had your share of RPG games you will love this game inspired by the creation of characters in D&D.

For any RPG lover is great to create characters with their backstories, equipping them with armors, weapons, purchasing skills and trying to maximize the attributes.

Solo, it's an enjoyable puzzle. I cannot play this one too many times in a row, or its sameness is highlighted. With two players, the interaction is minimal but is enough to keep some pressure on the proceedings.

The design idea of an RPG character creation as an puzzle game is an innovative idea.
Game design is clean and I see the puzzle depth to juggle the effective dice placement.

I backed this on Kickstarter on the very last day and I'm quite happy I did so. I got it in the mail yesterday and I have played a learning 2-player game (against myself) and a real 2 player game.

This game has some really tough decisions about what dice to take, when to place them (such as wanting to make a swap where both dice end up in a better position) and even when it comes to the gear. I haven't figured out a good way to use the skills yet. I always tend to have my alignment in its correct spot too early and then I have no way to use the skills.

When I played the 2 player game, Javier was the rogue and could choose not to change his alignment when using a skill. This meant he could use them quite often and it made the game more interesting for sure. But not in a bad way for me, I did fine overall and only lost by a few points because I made a silly mistake at the very end. I did end up being able to collect all 5 of the chainmail gear which gave me 11 points (since I was the cleric). Great game overall and I would be interested to play with 3 or 4 players.

RATING: 9
If you like puzzles and fantasy themed games, this is one for you.  You'll end up spending most of the game staring at your player sheet, trying to figure out where to put the dice you draft.  It can feel a bit solitaire-ish, which may be a deterrent for some, but the puzzle is really intriguing.  You have to figure what color and number dice you need and where to place them in your player sheet.  Where you place them will give you a way to manipulate your dice.  Then you need to decide which equipment or skills to buy.  The game is relatively simple but has great strategic depth.  Great solo mode as well.

A neat puzzler, which was surprising to me since it's not what I would have expected given the theme! The game boils down to the placement of dice in a dice grid, trying to get various sums in each row, and various colors of dice in certain places. The placements will also dictate various special abilities that mostly allow you to manipulate your dice in various ways.

Add to it a bunch of cards that do various things, and you have a really neat puzzle in which you try to maximize your score. Neat and unexpected, and the theme did a great job of supporting all of it!

Nice little dice rolling game with the very unique theme of creating an RPG character. The components and artwork are all really nice and evocative of fantasy RPGs and the game has a surprising amount of tough decisions to make. There are a lot of ways to score points but it is impossible to go fulfill them all so players must make some important choices throughout the game. I also enjoyed the variety of ways to mitigate dice rolls from attribute abilities, skills, and equipment. It is a bit lighter than what I usually go for, but I would definitely recommend it for it's unique theme.

I'm really not sure about this one yet. I did everything the game kinda forced me to do regarding aligning the dice  in color order and being mindful of my characters attributes and the numbers needed. Players equally took advantage of the skill/trait , gear and weapon cards. In the end, the scores were 34-33-32 and I never felt like I was ever making important  decisions. I felt like I was just going through the motions of picking dice and buying cards while not really playing a game. Yes, its balanced but I felt it was a little too balanced, if that makes any sense. I would play it one more time just to see if I missed something in all the craze.

Pretty good game. I like the way dice are used in this one, the roll of the dice allows for some good decision making. Character development seems cool and different.

Some limitations to this game, particularly at the 4-player level, leave me somewhat flat.  The right-left binding makes for an uneven number of first-player turns in a 4-player game -- where going first means getting the first choice of a fixed number of dice.  Asymmetric powers do not seem to be balanced.  Clever mechanics and good theme rescue what would otherwise be a dreadful exercise in randomness.

Very original and thematic game about creating character as we know in oldschool RPG games. This is a puzzly dice game where you try to build up your character sheet the best as you could, mitigating the dice to score the most points. There is a dice drafting mechanism (in multiplayer games) which is pretty good. In the game are also included several types of cards (weapons, armors, trait, skills) which help you with creating the character.
The solo mode is very good - it is quite different from multiplayer game as it is more puzzly and brainburning.

What I like:
- theme. I loved playing RPG games and also creating new characters and this game is very good at simulating it (also it is at the end VP oriented, but the theme is there for sure and it is very strong)
- the puzzly character of a solo play when you try to maximize your character's strengths and minimalize weaknesses. 
- nice production quality, the box, lots of dice, character sheets (with holes for a dice), cards. everything is nice.
- there is a lot to do (basic attributes goals different for each class, Alignment goal, Backstory goals, skill and trait cards, collecting Armor, etc., you brain will be boiling with choices and decisions each turn.

What I dislike:
- I don't like to put the first preset dice (six for solo play) as they waste your abilities and this game phase is quite dependent on luck (on dice you threw). 
- this is at the end the VP maximization game, don't expect some RPG story game. Somebody could be disappointed that the final character is only comparable with others with the score. No final fight, no adventure etc. (I don't mind this and it is more or less solved wit the Monsters and Minions expansion).
- It was very hard to find a copy in Czech Republic. And I fear that it would be almost impossible to get in few years. This is not a game with a wide distribution as lot of others.
I had some damage on few character boards due to the humility and I have to take care so I am not forced to replace it.

I enjoyed playing this game. It's like a puzzle trying to get the dice to do want you need and it uses a dungeon and dragons theme to tie this in. There is allot to think about in this game and I like that. It really is a singular game as there isn't allot of interaction in this game and that is something I don't usually like but this game keeps you thinking enough that you don't miss the interaction, yet it adds just enough to keep it interactive. This is a good die game. There's allot of replay value in this game as well.

Loving this game, quick to the table and easy rules, while still having a very strategic puzzle quality.  I think my avid gamer friends will enjoy playing this with my friends that are newer to the crunchier BoardGames.  Higher end gateway with awesome theme. I love the theme, never actually played D&D but had many friends who were obsessed in the 80’s so it’s very nostalgic for me.  Components are average, ordered upgraded coins and expansion direct from publisher as late pledge on recent Kickstarter, think that might elevate to a 10 as a great anytime game.

When I first heard the premise of ROLL PLAYER, I thought, "that's so crazy, it might just work." And it does. Like DOMINION makes a game of the deck building meta-game of MAGIC: THE GATHERING, ROLL PLAYER takes the meta-game of D&D character creation and turns it into the game itself. 

The dice results puzzle grid is the primary focus of the game, appealing to those who enjoy that sort of optimization and personal puzzle-solving, beyond the fantasy RPG trappings. As with many puzzle-like games, player interaction is slim, though not non-existent. There are two rounds of drafting--first for dice, then for cards--so opportunities for denial and tough timing decisions are frequent. 

Do I take this high die and pick cards last, or this low die and pick cards first? Oh, but I need that purple die to match my Background card... Wait, the green die matches my Character Class for an extra point.. But if I take the gold die, I'll get the extra coin I need to buy that thing... Lots of fun!

Longer but also has more player interaction than it's direct competitor Sagrada in the selection of dice and race for various market cards.

Prior knowledge of the dice arrangement requirements of the market is important, especially if the cards are revealed midway through the game when it is too difficult to rearrange your placed dice to suit any new market cards.

A very solid dice drafting puzzle game.  The theme comes through very well in this.   It will be compared to Sagrada most likely, and that is the closest thing that I've seen.   The colors and presentation, along with quite a bit shallower game play will make Sagrada a better family game (for me) but this is the game that I personally would rather play.   The dice are a bit bland and the art and cards are very dark and oversaturated with ink.  This is pretty common with Kickstarters and novice publishers.   But it's not a huge complaint - just could have been done better.  Good game with plenty of challenge.

Upon repeated plays, I'm actually not so sure that the theme comes through at all, and the game does move too slowly.

I like that this is a dice drafter as well as a tableau builder.  I love the theme, and am always a fan of John Ariosa's art.  There are some good decisions to made as well.  However, the theme never seemed to rise above the numbers for me, and despite there being a couple points of interaction, it just didn't feel like enough.  I only played it two player, and could see it being better with more as the options during each round would increase.  I also only played it once, so first impressions here...

This and Sagrada also only serve to remind me that the best dice drafting games already exist :  Troyes and Grand Austria Hotel.  Troyes is probably my favorite, but my significant other absolutely hates the art and the game, so I'll probably never play it again.   Grand Austria Hotel is my fault.  I really hated the script used on the cards, and was really unsatisfied knowing I'd probably never play it with more than two due to the snake draft.  I think Mayfair cleaned up the script in later printings though which would probably be enough for me, but I just can't find it in me to buy the game again, despite having bought several other games multiple times.  Sometimes I'm just a stubborn ox, especially when it comes to Mayfair games for some reason.  I mean if you're going to charge a premium for your games...and have you seen the Barenpark insert?  Their games don't even come with baggies...rant rant rant blah blah blah.

That's Roll Player.  I'm not into it, but at least Thunderworks provided bags to store the game components, had readable fonts on their cards, provided a standard cardboard insert, and used unoffensive art style.  The purple dice are pretty too.

I sometimes think my interest in rating and comparing games makes me enjoy them less.  I feel like some obnoxious food critic who says the croutons are too big.  Maybe I should just stop and enjoy the ride.

I was pleasantly surprised by this one as it really hit the Golden Triangle of rules-->decisions-->length. To hell with the theme, it really could be anything -- anything -- and that doesn't matter to me. It's a dice drafting and manipulation game that offers good decisions.

The heart of the game is after you draft a single die each round, you have a chance to buy a card in the market. These range from bonus powers to boost your play to endgame VP cards, and they're much tougher decisions than you might think. On some occasions, in fact, you simply have to eschew taking a card in order to take the "be a dick and discard a card that she really needs" action because it's one of those set collection cards that multiplies the more she has. 

Placing dice on your dice tableau trigger certain powers (change a die value, swap dice, etc.) and the placement of certain color dice in certain spots will get you VPs. As will completing a row with the requisite number of pips. For example, your strength needs three dice of 18 pips (OK, that's mildly thematic). If you do this, you'll get 3VP at game end.

So draft dice, place certain colors in certain spots, fulfill pips requirements, buy the right in game and endgame cards. Finish in 45 minutes. Good stuff.

TLDR: If you don't buy this game, you're wrong.
I've played this 3 times now since I received it. It's a very well designed game with a lot of moving parts, but the execution and rules structure make it approachable for most gamers, while providing a lot of in-depth strategy for those meta gamers out there. You can play a simple, straight-forward strategy, or delve into the many combos and hard to detect strategies available. The more you play, the more you come to appreciate the depth of the game. 
It has a little something for everyone. 
Now all we need is a follow-up game that will allow us to use the characters we create with this game. C'mon Keith, I know you got this. :)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
No player interaction really and you are simply picking numbers to put in an order on your board so it doesn't actually feel like you are creating a character.
Its quite mathy, as you try to manipulate the pips on the dice. Generally higher numbers good lower numbers bad, which is a bit of a shame. 

Market cards are a little bland, especially armour which is a set collection for points. 
Not a bad game system, but there's nothing that makes me want to play it very much, especially as there are much better rpg/board game hybrids out there

I was really hyped to play this and the first time was great, mostly as the novelty of making a D&D character be a game really appealed.  However, subsequent plays have become increasingly dull.  For my money, Sagrada scratches a similar itch but is cheaper, quicker, has nicer components and most importantly, is more fun.

Smacks of games such as Sagrada (but stepped up a level) and D&D.  It is an uncomplicated game with a great rule book and good components.  There is certainly a strong element of luck that I usually abhor.  However it is offset with strategy in timing, dice placement, card acquisition, and initiative positioning.
     I am definitely NOT a D&D player, but this is  a keeper for me--interested to play the expansion where our characters fight...I assume it will be D&D like....hope there are differences....

RATING: 4
This went on for about 25 minutes longer than it needed to.

I would have ended it once everyone had 6 empty die spots left on their board.  Then it would make it a little shorter, but also a bit more strategic in that you couldn necessarily reach all of your class goals.  The class goals would probably have to be reduced a bit, but if you then wanted to take this character and then actually play with them you could get 36 extra points to allocate however you wanted.

2 of us never felt like it was difficult to max out, or nearly max out, our dice at 6's.  Even with taking some 1s, if you dropped them in the flip die or reroll spots you could instantly change them.

This needed a bit more playtesting to see those problems.

INITIAL IMPRESSION
A meta game about "rolling" a new DnD character. The game revolves around drafting dice and shopping from the market into order to hit certain objectives such as the correct attribute score, background story, traits, etc.

A lot to think about in each dice selection but it was a bit long with 4p for me (1.5h) and I wasn't paying that close attention to what other might want. May be better with 3. Definitely probably better if we used certain modular setups/varients

A novel use of dice drafting which becomes incredibly thematic in its wrapping of RPG character (stat) development. Also a finely balanced tactical layer which allows players to feel like the luck of the dice can be assuaged and forgiven.  Roll Player is Dice drafting taken to its natural conclusion.

Really challenging, colorful puzzle wrapped up in a really solid dice drafting mechanic with a great theme. My only complaint is that dice mitigation in this game is HARD and I wish you didn't start with six dice. I wish I could construct my character from the beginning with the whole board open to me. I also don't like how much card text each market card has and how important those are to the overall scoring. That said, I much prefer this to Sagrada and really look forward to playing it more.

There's too much plug-and-chug (this die is worth 2 VP to me here and 3 VP to me there, done) for the interesting parts (card drafting, when do I use my tiny number of special ability activations?) to shine.

Also has the problem that just reading some of the cards (alignments, mostly?) is fun, which obviously isn't a PROBLEM problem but is the kind of thing which makes me round other people's praise for the game downward. Yes, it's a neat idea. Neat ideas are cheap.

It's been a while since I've been suckered into a game on account of its theme, so I presume I was overdue. This is a pedestrian dice/drafting game that doesn't even make good use of its trappings--all the cool bits (alignment, class, background) are merely scoring conditions. You then spend much of the game upping your attributes, which isn't nearly as thematically satisfying to me.

As I liked the idea, the name and the theme of this game, I had to play it.

Well, there is a good amount of luck involved and it's more or less solitaire (there is "some" interaction), but mentioned things overshadow this. This is one of the rare games that I like, even though I normally wouldn't.

If you are into RPGs (it reminded me of Wizardy), give it a try.

This one surprised me, in that I liked it a lot more than I expected to.  Plays fast, but with a sufficient puzzle to be satisfying.  There is obviously a lot of dice rolling, but I felt like I had plenty of ways to mitigate bad luck.

Components are good overall, with chunky dice and thick player boards.  The cards are also great quality, so much that I almost didn't sleeve them.

This clicked right away with my group, and everyone wanted to roll up some D&D characters based on the crazy characters we ended up with.  I could see this becoming a frequently played think-y filler.

I'm not a fanboy of D&D, and do not play RPGs. I like the little thematic stuff your character gets in setup (Backstory, Alignment and Clas), and how they change how you play the game. A Euro-game for sure, don't let the theme fool you into thinking this is some kind of mindless bashing...

Both the solo and multiplayer versions of the game are fantastic.

Theme isn't everything though, and the game itself manages to be both thinky and light at the same time, not to mention fun. The funnest part of playing RPG's for me back in the day was creating my character; turning that part into a game on its own is just genius.

I think the idea for this game is quite novel. You're trying to make the best "role-playing" character in some fantasy universe, by bolstering their stats to match the class you are.  I've played a few games of this and have mostly enjoyed it, but I may not be the correct target audience for it. It has a ton of micro-managing in-game to get you character to where you need them to be, but that in of itself can, and will cause of ton of AP...it did for me sadly.  Ap isn't a horrendous thing, but I fell to its trap constantly in this game, and I've lost every time I played it against people I taught the game to. Weird cause I love Five Tribes and feel the decisions in that game are tougher. 

A solid game, that I enjoy solo(surprised?) but don't think I can play again with others for the sake of their sanity.

Strange game about rolling up a role-playing character. You have the standard D&D array of 3 dice for each of 6 attributes and you claim a die each turn from a common pool rolled that turn. You also have equipment to buy and alignment to set. And you have various ways to manipulate the dice and move them around, so if you get a bad roll you're not necessarily stuck with it. At the end of the game, you get points for how well your character was constructed, based in part on the race and class you got at the beginning (so fighters need strength, etc). Considering the theme, it's interesting that's it's really just a Euro point salad game. But kind of fun.

As an old RPGer who has rolled up many a character in my time, I had to get and play this! The game did not disappoint, but neither did I find myself super-engaged while playing. It's a game about getting certain values and colors of dice in certain placements in order to get points. It craftily takes race, class, alignment, and background into account for the character you are creating, each providing their own non-conflicting goals for the player to juggle. Every turn, players draft a rolled die to add to their attributes, execute a special attribute action depending on where the die is placed, and then optionally buy a card from the market. The are four types of cards: weapons provide powers, but you are limited in what you can have; armor provides end-game points for sets; traits impact your alignment and usually scoring; while skills impact alignment each time they are used and offer a range of smaller abilities.

That's it: draft a die, take the corresponding action and maybe buy a card and/or use the cards you have. Forget the trappings of character development, this is all about the dice and if you like to manipulate dice you'll probably like this, if you don't care for that there isn't really anything else on offer here. I can enjoy, but do not love, dice manipulation and that kind of sums up my feelings about the game as well.

Drags with 4. Plays fast with 2, however there are numerous scaling issues with the game. Many cards are more-or-less powerful with different numbers of players. You don't see all the dice with fewer than 4 players, you see much less of the deck with 2 players.

RATING: 6
Not having played RPG/ dungeon crawling games before, the concepts were a little unfamiliar but picked up easily enough.  There is a nice blend of luck and strategy between die selection and character building, so I think that its weighting should be a little higher than it's currently showing.  Good replay ability with the different boards/ combos.  Some of the group complained about the lack of direct interaction; I was fine with the level in the game, but apparently the expansion(s?) add more to that so that you actually _use_ the traits, weapons, armor, etc. that you acquire

Surprisingly fun game if you love meta games. Each individual move is simple on the surface, but there are so many things to think about, and if you like thinking about character creation, this game is the very essential experience.

RATING: 7
It runs a bit long to be considered filler and the humor may not be there for those not steeped in a D&D background, but the game is enjoyably breezy and it will be plenty of fun for the right kind of players.  Who doesn't love the thought of generating a cunning Dragonborn Ranger acrobat dressed in leather or a savant Dwarven Sorcerer who favors fighting Florentine with a longsword and bejeweled dagger?

Lots of love for this game.  Can be played in about an hour and has plenty to think about for how to min/max your character for the best path to victory...

Plus huge handfuls of colorful dice.  This game is right in my wheelhouse.

Dice Drafting is a great mechanism, and I love the multiple ways to score and affect your possibilities, but this is just... too much. This lacks streamlining, and while the theme is really cool, it doesn't make up for the fact that Sagrada does 90% of the same game on half the weight.

I'm not normally a fan of beat-your-high-score solo games, however the random nature of the character creation gives the game a great fantasy narrative that really clicks. My first game was one of the solo challenges here on BGG - which is great for the solo player btw! - however I'm looking forward to giving it another go with a truly random setup ...

A light-medium weight game that focuses on dice manipulation and tableau building. Add dice to certain character attributes to use the powers to change the values of other dice, and gain equipment for your character for end game scoring and special powers. 60-75 minutes with 3-4 players.

This one truly surprised me!  I am an old-school D&D fanatic, so the appeal of this one may be slightly affected by that.  Even if you aren't into playing fantasy RPGs, where you create a character (which is a lot of the fun, on its own), you should have fun with the dice drafting and manipulation in this game.  The cards you buy further affect the game and I love trying to work out the puzzle of how to "min-max" my character the best way.  heh  :-)  Easily one of my favorite games from 2016.

One of my favorite games of 2016, and is quickly become one of my favorite dice games of all time. The theme of the game is fantastic, the way you play the game is rather straight forward, roll dice and place in your attribute slots to match the number range of your class. Very straight forward but there are so many ways to adjust your dice, move your dice to other areas, gain equipment to change your totals AND get other traits to adjust your VP condition....I just love, love, love this game.

Lucky enough to get to demo the game a couple of times with Keith today and while I was already excited for this game based on what I had read & seen, it surpassed my expectations.

In Roll Player, you will compete to create the greatest fantasy adventurer who has ever lived, preparing your character to embark on an epic quest. Roll and draft dice to build up your character’s attributes. Purchase weapons and armor to outfit your hero. Train to gain skills and discover your hero’s traits to prepare them for their journey. Earn Reputation Stars by constructing the perfect character. The player with the greatest Reputation wins the game and will surely triumph over whatever nefarious plot lies ahead!

RATING: 7.2
Although it has a fantasy theme and dice rolls, also you just keep improving your character, the game itself is practically a dice game or a dice-roller Euro, not an AT game at all.
Which is really fine for me! Even though a lot may depend on the order cards are revealed in for each turn (and the cards that are left out - e.g. as a Barbarian my special ability was to hold more weapon cards than others; too bad the cards that were not in the game were all weapon cards), it is more like a logical puzzle: how to score the most by best placement and use of your dice and your cards. In a way it's a bit like Sagrada with less restriction on placement rules and more special actions available - and I really like Sagrada. :)

Played my brother's PnP copy and really enjoyed this one. There is a bit of dice drafting, dice manipulation, and special powers as well as set collection and a few other things and it comes together to form a fun experience, particularly if you enjoy the character development aspect of RPGs and such. Glad I kickstarted this one.

Fun, puzzly, dice selection game with random character assignment and starting traits. For my first game, I was a charming, persecuted, lunatic Halfling bard. I :heart: Roll Player and think that it's a far superior game compared to Sagrada. More puzzle, and more fun with the character variability, card powers, and set collection of armor. Sagrada looks pretty, and I do like the stained glass theme, but Roll Player just has so much more going on.

"Roll Player can also trigger AP in those prone to the disease. There is a tendency to want to min/max everything and some people won’t be able to just make a decision and move on. They’ll want to work through every possible permutation of every action on every piece of the puzzle and you will have to sit there while they do it. There’s nothing to do when it’s not your turn, so AP prone players can cause pain for everyone. "

I love the idea of this game, rolling up a character for an RPG you won't be playing. The different ways of scoring make for very tough choices, and the dice manipulation, while usually something that turns me off in a dice game, is well used here. It's an extremely clever design and a lot of fun.

Dice drafting game with a very unique theme.  Every part of this game plays with the theme of RPGs in a clever way.  Unexpectedly, the back half of the game becomes incredibly and intensively puzzle-ly.  Min-maxing has never felt this good, though.

My dream is to follow up every game of Roll Player with a one-shot D&D campaign with our almost-certainly inexplicably characters.

Not sure this is a long term keeper for me.  Played Sagrada first and decided it was too light (for the price) and thought I should check our Roll Player instead.   I like how many different ways you have to score points.  It really makes you balance how you do things.  However, I think I'd enjoy RP more with more options to manipulate the dice.  Has some decent tactical play, but near the end of the game, you're just kind of stuck with limited options for manipulating the dice.  So, the further you get into the game, the less options you have available to you - doesn't make for a fun end game since it lacks tension.  Good for maybe 5-10 plays.

I don't see the appeal in here.  It's a dice game with numerous mitigation options, which by itself is fine, but I felt the game had some pretty obvious answers to any problems I've had.  There wasn't any moment in my games where I had to carefully examine the situation.  There is some interaction in the game such as trashing a card a player might need, but it felt like a solitaire experience.

While I don't mind games that are focused on your engine and had a solitaire vibe, I feel the "puzzle solving" aspect of Roll Player doesn't match up to games like Roll for the Galaxy.

It's kind of amazing this game actually works, but it does. Besides the wonderful theme, what makes this game is a dice drafting mechanism that forces you to choose between high dice and the chance to buy early in the card market - buying order is inverse to the dice value, which creates interesting decisions.

The luck is pretty high in this one, particularly in the setup - anyone who wants the fairest game should use the variant where everyone starts with an even spread of dice.

This game was sadly overrated for me. The idea of a game about character creation is in theory fun, but it just made me want to play D&D and leave the board game alone.

LOVE! Works great as a 2 player game. We love fleshing out our characters' stories/personalities as we go. Lots of interesting decisions. I very much appreciate that each race comes in both male and female versions. Solid game.

Edited to add: My copy had an issue with damage that obviously was done in the factory (cuts across one of the player boards). I sent an e-mail through the Thunderworks website, worried about whether I would get a response. I did NOT need to worry! Keith himself responded to me in under an hour and sent out a new player board the same day!!! Amazing customer service. Bravo! I immediately ordered the Frogkin promo board to add to my game.

When I first heard about this game, I knew that I needed to hunt down a copy. The person who designed this game really had a great idea to go off of. I used to love rolling up characters in RPGs, and this is a game all about doing that. Granted the decision space is a bit small, and the game goes on a little too long for my tastes. I want to try the accelerated rules, but I almost wonder if a variant where 2 dice were added to each initiative order card would help speed things up? Still, this is a solid little game, and aside from maybe not having as much variety as I would like, I can't help but wish that this was an idea I could have designed a game around.

While some fairly interesting role-playing elements like backstory and alignment appear at the beginning, after that, the game is largely a math exercise in min/maxing your dice totals amidst drafting to deny/acquire the best die and equipment/skill.  And there is actually very little rolling of the dice.  Something I didn't see coming, since 'roll' is in the title :)

A good game, yes, but I wasn't expecting it to be quite this abstract or mathy.  And that is ok, but I suspect this will be a deal breaker for many.  It's fairly dry, there is very little interaction between players and there is very little narrative.  Decisions never seemed particularly difficult over the 4 games I have played.  Kind of dull/boring.

[b]Roll Player[/b] was sold via auction 10/15/16.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6 -> 6)[/COLOR]

[i]I was really excited to play this, I thought my son [i](who's an avid role player)[/i] would love it. And while I first thought the positives outweighed the negatives, I was wrong. The collection of different dice manipulation mechanics and other card effects don't come together in a cohesive package and we just weren't having much fun while playing. I was completely on this one even though there are a lot of people who like it. I would much rather play a game like Sagrada if I'm looking for a dice placement/manipulation game. Sagrada is definitely lighter, but I view that as a strength of the game. I found Roll Player to be overwrought, I would have enjoyed it much more if it was more streamlined. Roll Player is one of those KS games that I think would have really benefited by having a developer fine tune the game.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]- Great with two.
- Heavier than expected with a few clunky elements, which could lead to some serious AP.
- Scores are based on the die value of each row as well the the color of the dice and where they are placed so decisions are never easy. 
- Each round begins with a dice draft and there usually isn't an obvious selection because you need to consider the value and color of the die you select.
- Placing a die in a certain attribute row triggers an ability, but at most these abilities will only trigger three times so you need to plan accordingly.
- Tracking your alignment can lead to some frustration since triggering card actions requires you to be able to move your cube in a specific direction on your alignment card which only has a few slots in each row. - I think the game lacks some polish and could have been streamlined more, some of the mechanics add to the difficulty in a random/chaotic way and this can be frustrating. 
- Great integration of theme, it's fun to build your character and create a story about them as you play.

I've enjoyed my plays, and will continue to bring it to the table but I'm really up in the air when it comes to how long this game will last in our collection. I really feel like it was so close to being excellent, but as it is there are still some rough edges. I will say the theme really sells it for me and is the main reason I want to play some more. When all's said and done I would recommend Roll Player, the positives definitely outweigh the negatives. [/i]

Simple dice placement game on the light side, also, more of a solo game, which I don’t like. It’s very random. Tried in tabletopia a couple times and was done with it,  as it got boring quite fast .  Getting everything placed where you want it was never really that hard. Unless you’re trying to beat your previous score there is not much fun involved.  If you’re into the dice placement mechanic there are a lot of better games than this.  And if I wanted a dungeon exploring type of game with cards I will play Clank over this any day.

After a few tries: 
The Monk always wins; it's too strong to be able to make an attribute action instead of buying a card. 

It is more important to mach your goals and traits than getting high numbered dice, but it is easier with high dice, especially if you roll high with your setup dice.

I'ts a good game, but I think you will get done with it after very few plays, it will just be the same every time.

This game really is fun. I found myself smiling as I thought of my characters. Nice weight for quick but meaningful solo play. Not very tense and not a game I really care if I win... I'll just go again.

I love how simple yet elegant the game is. It is case in point for why I complain about FFG all the time. Their solution to every question is another rule and set of mini cards, and every new element complicates the game making it less fun and friendly. Roll Player has a few very good ideas integrated together well and kept simple - ie. they polished and edited instead of writing another 200 pages.

2 plays - not as unique and engaging as I'd hoped. While the theme is definitely a winner (and this definitely warrants a play or three), the game play itself is not going to surprise you or leave you wanting to play several times more. It's a fun enough puzzle with time-proven mechanics, but not enough to keep me interested past a few plays.

Roll Player is a dice game about building a role-playing character's stats and equipment. At the beginning of the game, players are assigned a race, character class, and a backstory. Each turn, players put a die in one of the spots on their character board. Rows of dice each correspond with a stat, and matching you character class's goal stats by the end of the game is worth points. Additionally, matching colors of dice to the diagram in your backstory is worth additional points, as well as just drafting dice that match your color. When placed, dice also activate a special ability depending on the row, which can modify that value of already-placed dice. There are also a number of skills, traits, and equipment that can be purchased, all of which provide either special abilities or end-game points. I really liked the idea of this game and found the dice manipulation to be a lot of fun. However, I found the game to be somewhat downtime-intensive as players worked through all of their options.

Too bad this gets dismissed so easily because of the box cover and stupid name.

The game is very very good and is a very clever design overall.

The player interaction is low, but not absent. A euro game at its core. The game may have LOTS of dice, but they aren't rolled as much and you have plenty of ways to manipulate them.

Basically a heavier version of Sagrada.

A game I liked a lot more than I thought I would. I like the different paths to take for points and since there are so many things to focus on it is nice to do it all. Drafting the dice is another one of my favorite mechanisms in this game, there is a lot to think about when you are drafting them, not just color but pips and order for purchasing the cards on display. A lot to factor in. I definitely want to play again and perhaps own it, if I can find it. Very enjoyable!

You probably know ahead of time which players are going to love this one, and which just aren't going to appreciate it. There is a solid tableau building, set collection, dice manipulation game here, but to really have a good time you should have some background experience with the theme. I had a blast swinging my alignment around with skill cards, triggering stat abilites to switch dice around, and min/maxing every aspect of my victory point conditions. One of the most interesting games I've played this year.

This is one of those games that gives my brain the type of puzzle it likes to solve.  Deciding which of the available dice are best suited for your attribute, deciding which attribute action will be the most valuable and how to use them, deciding which skills to buy so you can take advantage of your alignment.  All good things.

My only criticism is that the game can get a bit thinky.  I really like thinky games, but I don't like the downtime that tends to correspond with them.  If you have players in your group that tend toward AP, you may want to avoid this one.

I did not think I would enjoy this game. The RPG theme of building up your character didn't really appeal to me. However, it turned out to be a fun dice placement game with some dice and card drafting. It does seem like your initial roll can have a lot to do with your final outcome. Nothing is impossible to overcome, but starting in the hole isn't a fun thing.

i'm surprised every time i play this just how thinky it gets by the end. this definitely feels a little lighter than it ends up... and that's great! i blame the dice, or rather my perception of dice in games as bringing chaos. the market, light though it fees as well, really brings an auction aspect that usually allows you to fumble your way towards purchases that match your strategies. you could almost call this a points salad... and, sure, why not? you get points for so many things and even the chance to purchase market cards for a few more potential point paths. as a survivor of AD&D from the 90s, i've drooled all over the nostalgia. min maxing with occasional thematic choices just brings me right back. i'm very much looking forward to the expansion where we then fight monsters after creating our characters. i haven't played Sagrada yet, but i feel like this is more my style by far.

The theme is really clever and the mechanics work, although the game felt a little too tight to me.  It felt like I couldn't ever use my skill cards unless I gave up trying to get the endgame points since I could only adjust it so much, and getting the attribute dice to add to the target ranges felt nearly impossible without taking mostly good pips and thus always picking last in the market. I can see why a lot of people like it, and I would certainly play the game again, but I prefer games with more flexibility.

Played a 4 player game. All new to the game. Finished in about an hour. The scores are very close. 32-30-29-28. So the game can easily go either way. It is a fun little dice drafting game. There are many choices to make each round but it doesn't feel the long time is long because you can do some of the actions while waiting for other player. In a sense, if you can keep track of the number of dice left in the bag in your mind and calculate the turn order. Like when it is your turn, you get to pick the dice first. That should give you some advantage. Overall, it is a perfect weight game for me. I didn't feel super satisfied after the game is finished but I certainly will play it again when the opportunity comes.

Roll Player is a good dice manipulation game with a fun theme.  The theme is clever and is neither weak nor intrusive in its implementation.  Turns go quickly and are engaging: I've experienced a series of difficult, thinky decisions, punctuated by the occasional quick choice when just the right die and/or card turns up, which can be exciting.  I have felt occasionally that I didn't have enough control over my dice - my least favourite thing about the game is the feeling of losing the opportunity to take each attribute action once you've done it just three or fewer times - but I also feel that in those situations, I could've chosen to take more manipulation skills and generally played better.  I'd recommend the game, especially to those who will be entertained by the theme.

I LOVED this game! I really hoped I would, and I'm very happy that it didn't disappoint. I love Sagrada and Azul and this one has that exact feel. Putting dice into spots to score points. This one is great because you have a lot of opportunities to swap your dice out if you get a bad pull. It's such a great game and you can really abuse certain abilities to your advantage. I like this one a great deal.

This is a dice rolling game themed around building an RPG character.  At the start of the game you pick a character race then are randomly assigned a class, backstory, and alignment.  Each of these randomly assigned characteristics scores in different ways.  Your class dictates the ending values you want in each of the standard six ability scores, your backstory dictates where you want each of the 6 different dice colors placed, and your alignment is moved by card buys throughout the game and you want it in a specific position.  Game play is super simple.  Every round a set of dice will be rolled and placed on initiative cards.  Higher dice values are placed on later initiative cards and cards after the first initiative can also have money on them so the benefits of going earlier in turn order are balanced out by dice value and a little extra spending money.  After picking initiative you place the die on your character matrix which also gives you an ability based on its position.  Then you buy from the market in initiative order.  The market is made up of equipment and traits that will score you more points as well as skills that give you extra actions to do each round.  Many of these cards also affect your alignment.

I think thematically the game is great.  This is about character creation after all.  You want specific ability scores to suit your class and certain items bought or actions taken (also represented by cards) will move your alignment toward one side or another.  The meaning behind certain color dice (which usually represent a specific character trait) being in certain positions based on a back story is nebulous though.

The game is super simple fun for anybody and tabletop or video game RPG players used to the act of rolling characters will get an especial bump in enjoyment from this I think.  Good dice rolling games have to strike a certain balance of supplementing the randomness of the rolls with control so the game doesn't feel too luck based and this one succeeds with flying colors in my opinion.

I do wish there was a little bit more variety offered by the chosen character race besides ability score modifiers like a starting skill or something.  And the humans seem like the best starting choice since they have no ability score modifier and character class is somewhat randomly chosen after race is picked.

Not sure how the game will turn out later after the first expansion. At the moment, it has several great qualities. It's fun to create your character and optimize it, key aspects of character creation have been well represented with dice and the concept was fun to start with for me.

There are 3 issues that prevent me from finding this game fantastic:

1. I believe the alignment mechanism to be broken. To use an "evil" aligned skill, you basically have to use a "good" skill afterwards in order to be able to use the evil skill again. It makes no sense and feels gamey.
2. Item sets are not very well implemented. Often, you can't even compete with players who would want to deny you the possibility of getting a set item to complete your set simply because it appears when it's not your turn to choose.
3. Once the cards are selected, everyone places their dice on their boards, unaware entirely of what others do, how they do it, and even if they do it correctly. Some form of player interaction during that phase would have helped.

The current rating is after solo plays only - I didn't yet have the chance to try it in our gaming group, but the rating could only go up from here.

The solo mode is awesome, despite it only beeing about beating your own high scores, the "puzzle" it provides is simply great. Deciding when to take a risk during the dice draft, deciding what and when to buy, and deciding when to use skills and where to put the dice to trigger the abilities to maximise the end score is really challanging and feels rewarding.

One of my favourite elements in video games such as Skyrim is character creation. In Roll Players, this is the whole game and it even combines it with my favourite mechanism, which is dice drafting. Good game.

I thought that this game was alright, it had a lot of little mechanics that interacted with each other in an interesting way, but really it did not bring anything new to the table. 

This is a Feld game in disguise, and honestly, I'm not a fan of most of his games, as I think they tend to lack focus.  As it is, this game has the same feeling and it might take a couple of plays for the true strategies to materialize if there are any, as you can focus on whatever aspects you want to try to min max your score.  Maybe over time it will become clear that certain tracks should be paid more attention too than others.

I also think extra items in the marketplace coupled with throwing some out in every game so you cannot card count waiting for certain items might make the game more tactical, which would be preferable, IMO

As a longtime D&D player, I love the theme of making a character.  You end up with mostly randomly generated combination of race, class, alignment, and backstory which determines the various ways you score points and a power that you have.  I found this part entertaining and thematic.

The meat of the game is drafting dice to put onto your stat sheet of the classic 6 attributes from D&D.  Each attribute gets 3 dice, and you score points based on the sum of each attribute and the location of certain colored dice on your board.  In addition to drafting dice, you also draft cards from the center that give points, abilities, gold, or shift your alignment.  Each time you place a die, you can also do something like move a die, flip it to its reverse side, reroll, etc.

The drafting was entertaining, but with all of the powers it was a bit too easy to get all of your stats really high.  There were also a number of balance issues.  Mainly, the various classes and backgrounds that you get randomly assigned have some powers that are absurdbly good and some that are useless.  Plus, there is variance of whether or not your cards synergize together, over which you have virtually no control.  Lastly, each class has a color and you get a point for each die you have with a matching color.  But, just by chance, one color might come out 5 more times than another color.  

Our 3 player game had a 1 point difference between first and last place, and it was impossible to chalk that up to anything other than pure randomness.  For a game 60-90 minute game, it left me unsatisfied.  I was also hoping the theme would come through more, but after the initial class/race/background setup, the theme was thin.  I'd play again, but might have to implement a draft for the class/race or something.

Not a bad game, but I feel like I need to try a few more rounds and do some house-ruling, becasue played out-of-the-box, it has some issues, but nothing I'd say can't be fixed? There's potential, but it is a bit janky as is. Biggest suggestion? Time limits to turns. Maximizing your score for a turn takes a LOT of careful consideration, and it can make turns take a LONG time if everyone is taking all the time they need... I suggest 10 minutes per turn to prevent the late rounds to breaking down into agonizing grinds of people doing math in their heads.

Ultimately, the concept sounded awesome, and I'd like to think it could be, but it requires some changes I need more trial games to sort out to figure out how. Score reflects it's current state, but I could see this qualifying as a 8 or 9 with some adjustments.

Regardless of theme,  kudos to Roll Player for offering a  truly unique experience in gaming. Perhaps because of the theme. some feel the game is incomplete - in that creating a characters attributes should lead to some sort of culmination.  That is missing the point.  It is only theme - the game lies within the puzzle - and it is a very good puzzle at that.

The game can be a bit light on interaction,  however denying your opponents during the dice / card drafting has  a great bearing on the final outcome. I highly recommend this game to any and all types of gamers.

Not one that I'd add to my collection, as it seems a bit simple for what it is, and doesn't seem like it's a whole game for some reason. Overall it is a fun game though and it plays quickly which is something that is really nice so it doesn't feel like it bogs down too much.

Tons of variability in this one. The theme doesn't do much for me, but I love all the dice rolling, the die selection mechanic, as well as the die manipulation.

My major gripe is the decision to have two randomly-assigned players fight for the same gear. This can - and does - lead to some players having a huge advantage in final scoring (if they don't have to fight anyone else for a set of gear while others do).

Imagine if rolling stats for a D&D character were a competitive game in and of itself. That's pretty much Roll Player.

You start with a character. But instead of knowing your character's stats and deciding which class best fits, you're given a class with certain stat targets. And your job is to get those stats to the right amounts by getting the right dice in the right places on your player board.

You also start with a card that gives some preferences about which color dice you want in certain spots. And also an alignment card with penalties and bonuses depending on which alignment you end up as (certain things in the game affect your alignment).

Each round there's randomly colored dice that get pulled from a draw bag and rolled. They're arranged from low number to high. The low numbers give you better turn order in the market phase, the medium numbers give you an extra buck and the high numbers you want just cause they get your stats up. Players draft the dice starting from the round's start player, each taking a single die in a round.

The die you take is assigned to a particular stat. When you assign a die, you're thinking about a couple of things. First, you're trying to get stats to be a particular number based on your starting card. Second, each stat type gives a different ability. Like increasing the number of any one die in your tableau. Or switching two dice. Or flipping a die over.

After everyone has assigned their die, there's a market phase. Players buy a card in turn order. Alternatively you can discard a card from the market for two bucks. Cards come in a couple of different types. First off there are weapons which are either single-handed or double-handed. These give you some ability. But you're limited in that you only have two hands. There's also sets of armor (leather, chain, mystic) which are a set collection scoring mechanism.

Then there's skills and traits. Traits are one-time effects (or end of game scoring). Skills are abilities that you can tap once a round. And if you have multiple skills only one untaps a round. Both traits and skills potentially affect your alignment. Each trait or skill skews you towards good vs evil or lawful vs chaotic.

Since trait cards are a one-time effect that alignment change happens immediately. But if you can't actually change, i.e. a fully good character can't become any more good, there's no issue, you just skip that change. Skills only change your alignment when you use them... but if you can't actually make the change, you can't use the skill.

You start the game with six random dice, which you place however you want. They don't trigger any of the stat abilities. That leaves 12 empty spaces in your player board (there are 3 dice per stat). The game lasts 12 rounds and ends in the round when everyone fills their last stat.

You've got several goals you're trying to meet over the course of the game. You want to hit your stat targets, first off. Those come in 3 types. Some of them have a simple 14 or higher requirement, but only give you one point. Others want a range like 15-16, but only give you two points. Some want an exact number like 17 and give you three points.

Additionally, you have a card that randomly designates certain dice spots with a particular color. You're trying to get as many of those filled with the matching colored dice as possible, with bonuses for how well you do. You're also trying to get a certain color of dice which is based on your character class. Each die of your own color you get is a point for you. Finally, you're trying to get your alignment to a particular spot on the alignment grid.

There's a fair number of points to be picked up from the cards in the market. As mentioned there's an armor set collection thing going on. Some cards just give you points. Some give you points if you're managed to accomplish certain goals, etc.

I enjoyed the theme of the game. It was fun playing a D&D themed game which wasn't just another generic D&D game. The meta aspect of playing a game about the set-up of another game was clever and fun. And while I could see people looking at this game as an abstract thing, I had a lot of fun roleplaying my lawful evil neurotic Wizard who had a leather fetish. And I was very disappointed that I wasn't able to snag the obnoxious trait card... not because it was particularly great for me, but because how could I not be the obnoxious player at the table!?!?! (Luckily everyone assured me I still was.)

I really enjoyed this game. It was a bit on the heavier side of lighter games... if that makes sense. It's not quite filler, but not that far from it either.

Surprisingly cruchy and thinky. It does a great job of giving the player interesting decisions. Do I take a low die for a better initiative with the intent to manipulate it later? How important are those market cards? Do I need money? What about getting points for the backstory? I suspect that this one might end up an 8 with a few more plays.

RATING: 7
This was another new game based on the theme of creating the best RPG character that you can based on your dice rolling skills and the skills and traits you acquire along the way. Each character is provided with a random background, with its own array of coloured six sided dice, that you can score for if you match them in the same position as the chart. (I completely ignored this as I wasn't listening when it was mentioned, although all was certainly not lost despite my misgivings throughout the game. You may also score for acquiring sets of clothing or weapons and must trade for turn order over dice scores when selecting whether you want to go first, with the lowest dice score, or later on with a better dice score. You may loose items, skills and/or traits that suit you if you make the wrong choice. That is part of the strategy to this game and having played, and taken on board my mistakes, feel it offers a good game although replay value is only average in my view. Gold dice equate to money and each character have specific coloured dice that score for them. Completing rows and columns or having a dice colour of all types in each column can score additional points. In the end, I banked on bonuses for poor attributes scores, as as my initial dice scores were quite poor. Each attribute allows manipulation of dice position and/or score, denoted on the double-sided player card hence why it is essential to score some points in all areas to maximise the likelihood of victory. It was a close-run thing in the end. A good game overall.

Very solid multiplayer solitaire game. The theme really works and if you have experience with roleplaying games and the creation of characters, this game captures that. It plays like an evolving puzzle. This WILL cause AP quite often for all players. Also there is very little interaction other than bidding for initiative. The art and components are both good. Scales well from 1-4 players. Overall a very good game in a genre I tend to stay away from.

I will always be a sucker for a unique theme (e.g., Xenon Profiteer), but Roll Player's motif is so highly targeted to RPGers that I'm happy to give it a shrug and a pass. I've heard of High Fantasy - but High Geek?  Loved my character's backstory, though.

Ignoring the theme, Roll Player is a math/logic game about dice manipulation and passing over certain scoring opportunities to pursue others.  If this what role-playing looks like through the spectacles of an accountant, it's best to stay away - at least when they're carrying d20s.

Even after winning, I didn't find the experience to be an exercise that bore repeating.  It wasn't bad, by any means.  Just not the fantasy roller coaster ride I had in mind.  

Admittedly, I fell prey to my own expectations.  I was hoping for endless cube-tossing, but that only occurs once per round - and only by the first player.  But none of that stopped my Eurolicious buddies from finding glee in their newfound Abacus of Square Root Desires.

Roll Player is quite intuitive, but it offers extremely interesting decisions. The colors and values of the dice feel equally important, and lower-valued dice aren’t always bad. You can even set yourself up to get stars for completely tanking an attribute, for example! Or, maybe you have too many high-valued dice in a row and you need to hit exactly 15. Even if you don’t get a die that fits perfectly into your plans, you have numerous ways to manipulate them. It feels immensely satisfying to manipulate your dice to perfectly align with your plans. I think it really speaks to the organization junkie within me. It’s the perfect blend of strategy and tactics for me with very quick rounds. I also love the theme. This game really hits on all cylinders for me and I can’t get enough of it. Love.

Roll Player is such a fantastic puzzle, but it requires so much decision making that it's going to be problematic for some groups. It brings out analysis paralysis in people that normally don't have AP (me). I like how the setup is randomized in multiple ways via boards, cards, and your initial dice. Unfortunately, the silence at the table during play just kills this for me.

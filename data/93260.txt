This is a fast paced, easy to play miniatures game offering nice variety and high quality production. It's easy enough in fact for nearly any age to understand (with some help on the special abilities). Yet it has great tactical play. It's brutal and quick - fine features for this style of game. I like it quite alot!

Juego para 2 jugadores, de cartas enfrentadas en cuadrícula de tablero. Varias barajas/facciones dispobles para jugar que dan opciones estratégicas diferentes. Muy buen juego en plan muy táctico, y muy variado debido a las difentes posibilidades de cruce de unidades y poderes de las diferentes facciones. El master set lleva ya suficientes pero hay muchas exp.

RATING: 5.5
*Rating based on one 2 vs 2 team game.

+Easy-to-learn rules set.
+Lots of factions to choose from.

=Artwork and component quality pretty standard.
=More of a tactical than a deep strategy game.
=Dice rolling for attacks adds some randomness.

-Preset starting setup seems limiting.  I would have preferred some way for players to choose their own starting forces and deployment.
-Players draw cards at the start of their turn, meaning it's impossible to plan out your turn ahead of time, increasing the play time.
-Player elimination in the team game can leave someone sitting and watching for a significant portion of the game.

RATING: 10
Avoided Summoner Wars for the first few years, rationalizing it with the few negative reviews out there.  Then, a few days ago, while checking in on the game I realized that it not only had established a very sizable fan base, but that it occupies a unique niche in most nearly collection.  

The rules are stoopid simple, the gameplay is obvious beyond belief, and yet the factions and their different cards are all so brilliantly constructed that this quick-playing game can easily hog all your table-time.   This is the genius of Summoner Wars -- it's not the rules, the art, it's the armies themselves, and the interplay between their match-ups.  

I realize this game isn't for everyone, but I can't think of any particular class of gamer that shouldn't check this out.  Open your mind, and give it a couple of plays, and I think you'll appreciate just how sublime this game's design really is.

Oh, and everyone hating on the artwork is entirely too judgemental.  Based on the Master Set alone, there's not a freakin' thing wrong with the art.  Sure, a few colors could've been different and stuff like that, but to say anything is like trying to send back a steak because your beer is too cold.  Shuddup and enjoy the bleepin' game!

The one criticism I have is that the game can feel very "claustrophobic" in the sense that movement is often severely constrained and you can often feel like you just don't have any good options to chose from.  Well, welcome to wargaming -- you did realize that Summoner Wars is a wargame underneath those deceptively simple rules, right?

A great game that suffers from a few flaws.  Firstly it has a lot of downtime.  There's very little to do while your opponent is thinking and not much point planning since the board changes radically after each turn.  Few interrupt cards as well and you can't even look at your hand until the start of your turn, i.e. more downtime.  Another problem is that it's only two player so doesn't hit the table that much, and although the Master Set comes from a great board, I wouldn't say the game is great value for money.  Unless you're hungry for tactical card games with a fantasy theme I wouldn't recommend this, despite it being a pretty cool game.

UPDATE: I'd recommend Mage Wars over this game pretty much every time...

A thematic game focusing on-board tactics and hand management. There are a lot of different factions with their strengths and weaknesses. I reckon some are better and some are worse with enough plays, but probably a lot of balance and certainly plenty of plays (due to combinations) before you discover all of this.
The master set has great organization and tons of extra room for expansion.  Game plays in about an hour and is easy to teach. There's better Ameri-trash but not too many that are this accessible.

I really enjoy the new factions.  Shadow elves and Benders especially.  Wasn't expecting as much but the Sand Goblins and Swamp Orcs are also fun to play.  Deep Drawves are also a great addition.  Still getting a feel for the Vargath.

RATING: 6
+ Lots of variety in factions; Building magic is a neat mechanic.
- Just doesn't feel exciting or fun when I'm playing.


Why it's previously-owned:
I thought that I was going to get a feeling like I did when playing Final Fantasy Tactics on the PS. What I didn't realize is that I really like the development of my troops instead of the actual tactical combat, and then development/improvement part of that equation is missing in this game. 
I traded this away for Star Trek: Fleet Captains.

RATING: 3
I've updated the comments because it seems I'm the only person who thinks this game is fatally flawed. 

The luck in this game is crippling. It's not just the arbitrariness of the 3+ dice rolling, which IS awful if only because you just can't cater to those kind of odds.
 
It's more that the skill of the game is maneuvering to minimise the powerful effects of your opponents. The reality is that it just doesn't matter because the champions are so diverse that you never really know what you're up against.

The whole thing means you just play each turn as well as you can and hope for the best. When you throw in things like Magic Drain and killing your own guys to preserve magic, the whole game lacks any cohesion. Summoner Wars is Chess, Magic, Poker etc. for people who like all of those games but weren't good at any of them. It's a nice glossy product with this Master Set, but it just isn't strategically compelling to me. 

I know this game has thousands of fans, but I've never found anything they've said to overturn these sentiments. This is a game for breadth gamers who think they're depth gaming.

How they take the idea of unbalanced character powers and make something so successful I will have no idea. Really fun. I like how quick it is to setup and to teach. I will never play this enough to learn successful strategies for every faction, but still cool.

RATING: 8
A solid card-driven two-player game I like playing with my sons. The master set includes a high-quality game board and six different faction decks. I really like the fact that a lot of thought has gone into making each faction distinct - they all play differently and require different tactics to perform at their best. The availability of more factions and other expansions makes this nicely expandable without becoming to much of a beast.

RATING: 8
Yet again, rival bands of fantasy folk do battle across featureless terrain.  No, the theme of Summoner Wars doesn't excite me.

Beyond the hackneyed theme there is a pretty neat little game.  The rules are simple enough to explain in a couple of minutes.  However, each turn presents tricky  decisions about what to summon, what to move and attack, how to protect your Summoner and how many events and warriors to convert into magic points.  On top of that, each of the six bands of fantasy folk included has it's own character, which alters all those tricky decisions. In my experience, games that don't go to the bitter end of depleted decks are few.  A few of those longer games have felt like an attritional trudge, but mostly I've been having fun exploring the different decks.

Production quality is good.  The artwork is unexciting, with a surfeit of murky greys and browns.  The rules are well written and seem complete.

A mix between warhammer fantasy battle and magic. A very nice combo. Very wellbalanced and plays fast.

We give it to Plaid Hat games for coming up with an extraordinary 2-player card game that doesn't require you spending hundreds of dollars in an attempt to collect the best cards. Their system of buying those packs and bolstering your own forces is very good. But there is something about this game that niggles us. The most annoying thing is that we can't put my finger on what. It is enjoyable to play but every time we look at it on our shelf we think , "Nah. Rather play something else."

Tactical combat game between rival summoners in dark fantasy work. The theme is silly, but honestly the game is still enjoyable if you don't care for it.

Wow. I never imagined I'd like a "dudes on a map" game without a map, or dudes (just cards) so much. This one totally replaces any conflict abstract game for me, due to the fact that it isn't an abstract, even if it plays like one. The factions are very well balanced, and very different from each other, and the mana system works very well.

UPDATE: I wouldn't "always suggest" it, but it's still a great game. Down to an 8.

Egy kicsit sakkra emlékeztető játék, csak itt a táblán figurák helyett kártyák vannak, amikkel mozogni, támadni lehet, cél a főellenség megölése. Óriásinak tűnik az újrajátszhatósága a sok faj miatt! Előnye még, hogy egyszerű, kb. 5 perc a szabály, maga a játék fél óra, ki- bepakolni is egyszerű, alig van kellék a kártyákon meg a táblán kívül. Viszont nyelvfüggőek a kártyák.
Tetszik az a dilemma, hogy ha gyorsabban akarom növelni a mágia paklit, hogy ezáltal több egységet pakoljak fel a táblára, akkor nagy eséllyel gyorsabban fogyasztom el a húzópaklit. Tehát egyik oldalon a lehetőségek bővülnek, másik oldalon viszont szűkülnek, jól el kell találni az egyensúlyt, vagy gyorsan kinyírni a másikat:)
Nekem nagyon tetszett, akár még emelkedhet is a pontszám!
---
Másodjára hosszabb volt a parti, szinte az utolsó kártyáig kijátszottuk, továbbra is nagyon jó, emeltem a pontszámon. A kieg paklik is jók! (egyelőre csak 2 van). Tetszik hogy egzakt és viszonylag egyszerű a szabály.
---
Annyira tetszik, hogy rövid a szabály, rövid egy parti, változatos és sok taktikai lehetőséget rejt, bármilyen paklipárosítással teljesen más egy parti, és a fránya nyelvfüggőség ellenére is kézenfekvőnek érzem, hogy játszani kell vele... :) Szóval mindez annyira tetszik, hogy ünnepélyesen a kedvencek közé került a játék. 9 pont!

One of the most fun games I've played. This rating is based on 1) Funness  2) Cost/Value ratio  3)  Replayability.  Everything about this game is really cool. I normally buy games based on movies, but this creates its own little theme so well that it doesn't need a movie to go with it. This game reminds me of chess with the exception that each piece has health and attacks/moves differently. (Normally movement is limited to 2 spaces i/e one forward, one right and being able to attack opponent's adjacent cards). Cards with the bow symbol can attack cards up to three spaces away. If you're looking for super deep strategy, you won't find it here. This game is medium strategy with just the right amount of luck.  I find that I'm usually in the mood for non heavy strategy games most of the time anyway.

The rules of this game are so simple that it can be taught in less than 10 minutes. It has a lot of randomness (the luck of the draw and the dice rolling). It seems very simplistic.
But it is readily enjoyable, and quite fun. And every faction plays in a very different and distinctive manner. I have thoroughly enjoyed my first plays...

The master set is the ideal starting point to start exploring the system: 6 factions, a (very sturdy) mounted board and everything else needed to play is included.

Initial tentative rating is a 6.5, but it could well go up...

Just received it so can't comment, but all indications are that it will be a great game.

OK.  I have now played a few games and this game is very good.  There are so many factions giving such a different gameplay everytime.

The problem I have with this game is I'm already in heavy with games that require a good friend or two to really dig into the game and challenge you with them.

This "feels" like another WarMachine or Netrunner that I would have to devote time to learn another faction as would my friends.

A bit too tactical for me, games seem a bit too much "you move here, I move there". Not sure how much life is left in this game for me. Traded away in November '13. Kids and I are tired of it, not much staying power unfortunately. It was fun the first few times but after awhile it just seemed too "samey".

RATING: 6
Solid game, although I'm sure I haven't scratched the surface. Not sure I like the luck factor being as high as it is in a tactical game. There were fairly big swings with both the dice, and the shuffle of the deck.

Amazing tactical skirmish game with a very thematic fantasy vibe. Each of the factions feels different, and each pairing (so far) seems to be a least fairly well balanced. You never get the feeling that two factions should never be paired together because one is obviously stronger. Amazing replayability as you feel out the strengths and weaknesses of each faction, not to mention all the expansions. Simple dice-based combat provides excitement and keeps the game moving at a nice pace. Fun, tactical, succinct and exciting. Praise all around!

Quite simply the best 2 player game I own.  Solid mechanics, and a ton of variety with the expansions.  Sadly it doesn't get played as often as I'd like since I rarely if ever have one on one board game opportunities.  Even so, I'll continue to purchase future expansions, with the hope that one day it will get much more playing time.  I rate Summoner Wars as a whole (i.e. All factions and reinforcements) a 10.  While what I have rated the individual expansions may slightly differ, The game as a whole is more than the sum of its parts.

Pro's:

1) Great variety in armies and playstyles. Factions feel quite unique and they tie together very well thematically.
2) Cards are very clear and I personally love the art.
3) Right combination of streamlining and complexity through interaction.
4) It is amazing that a game that is so inherently simple can give of the feel of a complex miniatures table top game. I have played Warhammer for many years and find that while it is of course far removed in many ways. I often find it satisfies that same itch whenever I feel the need for it.

Con's:

1) The difficulty levels of the factions can be quite brutal. Some are much more forgiving than others. Elves or benders are by and large much harder to play well with then say Dwarves or Mountain Vargath.
2) I wish the board had a bit more flair to it. It is very efficient but I wish it had some aesthetics with more obvious nods to say terrain.

Side Note:

Speaking of terrain, maybe this is demented and would take away some of the accessibility of the game but I would love an expansion with some buildings beyond just walls. Maybe some buildings that provide special powers for each of the factions that could add to the positioning element and give the game some RTS elements. Though maybe this is a terrible idea.

What a game! You can learn or teach this game really easily, but that belies the fantastic depth of strategy you will begin to uncover after a few games.

The use of dice is excellently balanced. The game doesn't hinge too much on luck, but demands that you are constantly thinking and making contingency plans for any unexpected outcomes.

Another excellent piece of balancing is the armies included in this set. Each has a unique play-style but they all seem really well matched. In fact, the more you play and puzzle out the different strategies available, the job the designers and play-testers did balancing this game becomes even more impressive.

I love this game. I would give it 11 if I could!

RATING: 8
Summoner Wars represents a terrific game system. Two different game mechanics and experiences are streamlined - card management and tactical gaming - and improbably integrated. What comes about a result is a remarkably elegant result which is lots of fun to play. What I'm struck by mostly is the value of the game. The rules are ultra-simple and the time investment of a two player game is minimal (30 - 45 minutes) but you are rewarded so much for the minimal investments. The game is deeper than it looks and the different decks play more differently than one would think. The Master Set offers a beautiful board on which to play and so many decks that the replayability of the game is now its greatest value. While not a filler, Summoner Wars is a light game which is absolutely perfect when you have two geeks who may not on a given day have the time or energy for War of the Ring. It's a game that fills this sweet spot as no other does for me.

Another case where a game wasn't quite what I expected.  I guess I wanted this to be something to replace Magic but it doesn't have that feel much at all to me.  Not really customizable, or not enough, with just the base set.  Strangely it felt almost abstract and chess-like with it's positioning and tactical maneuvering.  But the variable powers and dice mean that it's hard to get much of an advantage.  The games I played were tiresome back and forth I kill your guy you kill mine contests of attrition.  A game that gives a similar chess-like feeling with a touch of luck is the Duke, which I like much much better.  The art is good but the off-beat fantasy stuff, sand goblins etc., fell a little flat.

Great game, solid 2-player head-to-head tactical combat / deck fighting. This would be a solid 7, and could go 7.5 on one more play.

The Vines seemed to overwhelm the playing board with the Orc race my son played. Maybe I needed to try and destroy them, but was preoccupied with finding defensive positions for my own units.

Its seems to be a game of maneuvering and timing, making for some fun decisions.

Fun, but there's not enough cool for me. Too much of the game is my crappy characters take a swing at your crappy characters. And we roll dice to do so.

I admit I'm also not a big fan of dice as resolution of a decision, preferring dice as creators of a decision space.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I really enjoyed my first few plays of Summoner Wars. The Master Set is actually a pretty good deal given the variety that comes with six faction decks. I had my ass handed to me three straight times and still had a lot of fun. For such a seemingly light game there are plenty of tough decisions and a lot of room for look-ahead and analysis. Further play will reveal how deep it goes. I will revisit as I play more. Bonus points for ease of play and (fairly) unambiguous rules, which is uncommon in ccg-inspired games.

UPDATE. Traded after sitting unplayed on the shelf for so long. I liked what the game was doing, and it worked quite well, but it's an awfully big box to have sitting around taking up space. I am knocking .5 off the rating for the box size and dimensions. Shipping that thing was a bitch.

RATING: 9
I'm a eurogamer as you can tell from my top rated games (8+). However, this game is my guilty pleasure... I just LOVE it! The tons of different factions that play out radically different is a lot of fun to discover, and the gameplay itself is so elegant! In theory I should like the more advanced Mage Wars more as it has more decisions and less luck, but SW is by far the better game in my opinion. Elegant, interesting, tense, fun!

I usually hate luck, but in this game it doesn't bother me as much, although of course it can suck when you have e.g. three dice, need one hit and then only roll misses... And yes I've had lopsided games where one of the players hit on every single die and the other one didn't, but it's very rare and over the course of the game the hits will most likely even out (although I think it's pretty important to get some hits at the start of the game to remove enemy units and get some magic yourself). There is also the luck of the draw, i.e. if you're so unlucky that all of your champions are at the bottom (or even at the top I would argue). Still, I feel like the luck in this game, both the dice rolls and the card draws, is manageable and on an acceptable level, and it really does feel like the best player usually wins.


COMMENT ABOUT THE FOUR PLAYER GAME:

I’ve played SW a bunch of times (as of 2016 70 times), but almost all of my plays have been with 2 players (which is really how the game should be played). However, I've tried it with 4 as a 2vs2 (I have no desire to ever try it with 3 players again other than the one time I did), and it worked very well! There are few team games out there, so I’m always thrilled when I find a good team game. 1775 is another good teamgame, but I found it too swingy due to the turnorder, so I actually think that, so far, SW is one of my favorite team games if not my favorite! It’s awesome with 2, but with 4 it was very good as well! There are only very few rules changes and I found they integrated well into the base game. With 4, I liked how the board warps around so you can move “off the board” from one side and enter on the other side! This also means that the summoners are more exposed I found. Also, if a summoner dies, you can still assist your remaining teammate and your teammate does get some sort of bonus (magic) when you die so everything is definitely not lost yet! Also, I liked how you can discuss strategy etc. with your teammate during the game. The downside, however, is that the game usually goes on for 1,5-2 hours, and that's a bit too long for my taste.

Overall I highly recommend Summoner Wars - it's by far the best game of its kind out there!

Lots of factions and cards to play with. It's kind of like a geeky chess game with more random elements. Even with the luck of the dice roll and card draw this game works great. It's an easy game to pull out and play without the need to build a deck. There's also a good amount of replay.

Summoner Wars is an unusual game for me because it's the only game that I played dozens of times on my iPhone before finally playing the "real thing." Now that I finally played it, I can rate this sucker. I'm a Summoner Wars fan. I freakin' love this game.

For whatever reason, this game just strikes a positive chord with me--quick turns, quick games, the tension of hand management, dice chucking combat... I just love the mix. It scratches that ol' Magic the Gathering feeling more than any other game I've played. I think a key reason why is that each deck plays very differently. I really admire how they've achieved such a unique feel with each race yet maintained a balance in gameplay.

I've played all the "original" races on the iPhone, but I finally got a chance to play the swamp orcs against the benders. It's another reminder for me about how impressed I am at the diversity they have created with each deck. Each deck feels very unique, with its own tactics, its own champions, and synergy between various cards.

I want to keep playing this game.

Update: ...and I've done just that. With at least 10+ live plays under my belt, I can easily rate this game a 10. I will always want to play this game and I expect it to be a permanent part of my collection. Great freakin' game.

I am loving Summoner Wars so far. It is so easy to explain and quick to play. There is a lot of interesting things that happen in each game. You can make a comeback from the brink of defeat. 

I'm hoping I can find some one who is also into it to start trying out the deck building side of things. I am starting to find that after 20+ games I am mercilessly crushing new players. I can see my rating going up if I could find a group of regular players.

RATING: 8.5
Rating based on 8 plays, 2 player. 

So far, I am very impressed. The multiple factions, and varied strategies for each faction, allows for incredible variety in gameplay and tactics. Also, it bears mentioning that the game can be taught in under 5 minutes. Yet despite its simplicity, it brings deep tactical and strategic decisions. 

Balance wise, the games have all been tight except for one, where my opponent made a few critical errors, and paid the ultimate price. 

Components are good but not spectacular. Card quality is average, but functional. Artwork is nice but nowhere near MtG quality. 

However, this game has one thing going for it that I must mention: Set up and Tear down. Literally less than a minute to set up, and maybe two to take down. With games lasting 30 minutes to an hour, its easy as can be to get 2 or 3 games with different factions played in an evening. Hell, you could realistically play 5 or 6 games in a 3 hour period, and all of them will be very different. 

This has potential to go to a 9 or more. However, I need to log more plays and play more factions before I make that move. For now, I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a quick, super simple, but devilishly deep game. 

EDIT: Well, I burned out on it. I'm not dropping the rating, because frankly, its a fantastic design, but I'm coming to terms with the fact that tactical combat games just aren't my schtick. However, that does not detract from the truly impressive design of this game. If you like this type of thing, you'll adore this. Traded away to a good home.

A simply awesome tactical skirmish game that never feels like it drags on for too long. There's a healthy dose of skill in positiong your units correctly and using their unique powers to your advantage, which helps offset the luck of the dice, There's also a very credible 4 player team-based version too, assuming you buy another board.

The more I play this game the more I fall in love with it. The basic gameplay couldn't be much simpler, but it's the brilliant design of each of the decks that brings it all together.

Fantastic game but stresses us out so much that we probably don't play it nearly as much as we should, which is why it is not rated as high for me.

EDIT: After playing this for a while, it doesn't see the table too often (not the right group size, the two player situations I'm in don't lend itself to SW), but it is a really fantastic game and I wish I got to play it more.

I just bought the game this week and opening up it was a treat for myself after giving my thesis presentation. 

I have been listening to the Plaid Hat Podcast through the Dicetower Network as a way to satiate my desire for everything board game while I was busy with school. The podcast is great and entertaining, and I knew I had to give Summoner Wars a try. I purchased the Master Set and downloaded the iOS. 

After a good presentation, I came home, opened the game, and booted up the iOS. I looked at the iOS before, but I couldn't make heads or tails of it. I read through the physical rulebook, looked through the decks (great looking cards), and without any friends to play with at that point jumped into my first game. 

It is great! Simplicity means I can convince all of my friends to get into it. I have a friend who loves MtG and will eat up the deck building. I have another friend who used to play Advance Wars religiously, and I can see him loving to card game meets board concept. The number of factions available is amazing, and when you add in deck building I can see this game becoming an experience I can really dive into, or keep it on the surface when I am busy and enjoy a quick game. 

The gameplay mechanics are simple and fantastic, while being thought provoking and providing meaningful decisions. For me this would normally mean analysis paralysis, but because the play time is short, I feel willing to "just go for it" and see what happens when I play a certain angle. 

The one thing I find interesting, not bad, mechanically is that when you attack a unit they do not defend in any way. It makes for an offensively based game, but being one who really gets into imagining what is going on as live action events, I cannot help but feel a little odd at this. I think the choice must have been on purpose, as most games provide retaliation that raises the stakes and provides some additional thought as well as making the roles of range and cc more interesting. 

Either way, I haven't been so excited about a game in a while, and I am eager to jump into it more.

Finally played my copy. Just one game so far. Not too impressed. Don't understand the hype. Seems very basic. And not in a good way. I wish the abilities on the cards were represented by graphic icons. I don't like having to read verbiage. And the cards don't look different enough to be readily recognizable. At least not in my first game. But I'll probably try all the civs in the Master Set just because. I don't have a good rational reason why this doesn't grab me, and yet Blue Moon did, which also has lots of special text. Maybe because only "special" cards in Blue Moon have special text. Or maybe because the specialness seems more special, without the encumbrance of the map. Not sure.

Ever have the itch to pull out those nice painted miniatures and clash with another army on the tabletop, replete with fantasy theme and special powers, but only have an hour?  Not going to happen with minis.  It CAN happen with Summoner Wars, though.  This fantastic card game gives you the same feel of moving your units across the table to vanquish your foes, but with a deck of cards.  You almost have to try it to believe me that it feels like a full minis game.  The artwork could be better, but it does its job evoking the theme and setting the tone.  Tons of replayability in the future with deck-building aspects and new factions.  Another MUST HAVE for anyone who enjoys a tactical fantasy battle.

Only a few plays, but feel like the game has an inelegant design.  A few of the things I feel are awkward: moving and attacking with your entire battlefield on the same turn, discarding cards and using discarded cards as your mana, and also having so many different abilities that you must read and know at once.  The game is very simple, but I find playing with new players is a drag, as they feel overwhelmed by all of the text on every card.  If it's like chess, it's like chess with extremely long turns and a pretty high barrier of entry.  I do think it's well balanced, and think the flavor of each deck is interesting.  I also LOVE the board that comes with the game.  I just feel like the game feels sort of clunky and awkward.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Plus expansions/Alliance

Wonderful 2-player game with many factions released that provide a ton of replay value. Each faction provides their own set of tricks, and even the second summoners within those factions provide neat twists. 

The game offers ways to customize your decks, but I love the fact that players don't have to do this and can simply play with the decks as arranged without any modification.

Since you don't shuffle your discards when the deck runs out and you continue play with what you have left, the game reaches the end game easily. This prevents the game from dragging out too long.

Only quips: The Filth faction tends to be a bit more repulsive in their design for my tastes, but they are insanely fun to play. The game can also produce situations (particularly when pitting two defensive factions against one another) where both players would prefer to wait for the other player to act, leading to awkward stalemate moments.

Simple 2P fantasy wargame that plays quickly and is super easy to learn. Interesting in that it uses rectangles for movement rather than hexes. Combat resolution is very simple, very much like Risk. Good variation in factions makes this worth keeping, I'll look into picking up expansion content in the future.

Playing this again recently made me realise that every time that I want to play a wargame with dice combat, I always prefer Titan or Cave Evil: Warcults as their combat mechanism is far less frustrating, and hex grid maps provide infinitely more interesting spatial decision making.

There is a lot i like about this game.  The artwork and theme within each faction deck are very well done.  The factions we played were unique but balanced.  Rules were good and it was easy to get started.  There were a couple special abilities that could have had a little more detail, however.  Add great support by the designer, and you should get every faction you can.
Great light game that is a good gateway game, or you can try to come up with the combos that exist in each deck.

Fantastic game, the movement and positioning aspects combine with the card-dueling and the deck building aspects (when the Master Set is combined with appropriate reinforcements and/or Second Summoners) and the number of options presented by the multiple factions in this set and elsewhere make this game a real treat with excellent staying power.

Voorbereiding :

De spelers kiezen een factie en nemen het bijhorende deck. Bij het deck zit een overzichtskaart en de startopstelling. Naast je summoner zullen er twee muurkaarten en een aantal monsters liggen. De overige kaarten vormen je trekstapel. Gooi met de dobbelsteen om een startspeler te bepalen.

Speelbeurt:

Een speelbeurt bestaat uit 6 fasen. De startspeler slaat de eerste 3 fases over tijdens zijn eerste beurt. 

1/ Kaarten trekken: 

Vul je hand aan tot 5 kaarten. Als je trekstapel leeg is, kan je geen kaarten meer nemen.  

2/ Monsters uitspelen: 

Betaal de kost op de kaart door kaarten van je magic stapel naar je aflegstapel te leggen. Monsters worden op het bord geplaatst, steeds naast een muurkaart.

3/ Eventkaarten uitspelen: 

Betaal de kost op de kaart door kaarten van je magic stapel naar je aflegstapel te leggen. Een event wordt meteen uitgespeeld en uitgevoerd. Na het effect van het evenement gaat de kaart naar de aflegstapel.

4/ Bewegen:

Verplaats maximaal 3 van jouw eenheden (kaarten) hoogstens twee velden. Enkel orthogonale beweging is toegestaan. Verplaatsing door andere kaarten is niet toegestaan.

5/ Aanvallen:

Je mag met maximum 3 eenheden (kaarten) telkens 1 keer aanvallen. Het maakt niet uit of deze eenheden in de vorige  fase al dan niet hebben bewogen. 

Zwaard symbool: melee aanval. 
Boog symbool: aanval binnen een afstand van 3 velden.

Nadat je hebt aangekondigd welke eenheid je aanvalt en welke eenheid je daarvoor gebruikt, gooi je het aantal dobbelstenen dat staat aangegeven op de kaart.

Een resultaat van 3 of hoger is een hit en een resultaat van 1 of 2 is een miss. Elke hit die je gooit, levert 1 wondtoken op voor de eenheid die wordt aangevallen. Heeft hij evenveel wonden als levenspunten, dan is de eenheid verslagen en komt deze op jouw magic-pile terecht.
Dit voer je voor alle aanvallende eenheden uit.

6/ Magie opbouwen:

Je kan ervoor kiezen om kaarten vanuit je hand af te leggen op je magic stapel. Hierdoor kun je de volgende beurt opnieuw kaarten uitspelen.

Elke eenheid en elke summoner hebben speciale eigenschappen die je mag gebruiken tijdens het spel. Zodra jij de enige speler bent met een summoner, win je het spel.

Sheer perfection! A easy-to-learn-but-hard-to-master type of game, this two player dueling card game has everything! From clean, streamlined mechanics, trough beautiful artwork, to six TOTALLY different races! And the playtime is just in scope of "hey, lets play a couple of quick ones". Its an instant favorite, and i can see it being played over and over, for many years to come, especially as with every playtrough we tend to find new tactics for every race to use

Falls somewhere between Chess and Heroscape, with maybe a little Dreamblade thrown in.   Very much a strong, 2-player, tactical game of moving unit cards around on a grid and trying to defeat the opponent's king (i.e. Summoner).  The use of discards and defeated enemies to power magic for summoning works well.   And while summoning units near walls is weird, it works well in the game too.  Plays quickly, gives enough to think about, and offers a lot of variability.   The glossy cards don't slide well on the glossy game boards, but this is a minor nitpick.

RATING: 6.25
I like the concept of summoner wars, and some of the execution, but a lot of it just kind of bothers me.  Fantasy battle game: sure.  Lots of different factions: absolutely.  Customizable decks (with the expansions): why not.  Simplified design with easily-understandable special powers: yes please.
But again, there are the problems.  I don't like how ranged combat works at all.  They can only shoot in a straight line (no attacking someone who's caddy-corner to you), they can only shoot 3 spaces, and they can't shoot through friendlies (barring special abilities that say otherwise).  Since there's no counterattacks in melee, and units can move 2 spaces a turn, there seems to be zero advantage.  
Also suffers from the 'wide vs tall' problem many games do (more on that elsewhere), but this is an even more extreme case.  If I have a huge expensive guy and you have a bunch of cheap ones, my bruiser can go around picking them off one at a time while they struggle against him.  Your guys are dead in 1 hit usually, and he fights at full efficiency until his last HP.  Add in one more thing: killed units are used as magic power in this game (one per card, regardless of power).  That huge guy you finally managed to knock off is worth 1 MP to you, while the 4 guys he killed pay for another beast from my deck.  Not only that, but you can only attack with 3 dudes a turn, so there's just no incentive to put a lot of them in play (unless you're playing with a 'swarm' faction which breaks those rules).
I think it may just be [i]too[/i] simplified for my tastes.

Fun game in concept and artwork. It's a skirmish combat game between two factions (or 4 with more boards) where players summon their warriors, play magic events and battle their opponents by tactical supremacy and dice.
I love the variety of factions and strategy and I want them all!
Cards represents units on the battlefield, which is nice, but maybe too flat for my taste especially since it can last up to 1 hour. One game per week is enough.

However luck factor has a huge impact on the game, and bad roll of dice can turn many players away.

[b]Favorite mechanism:[/b] The different structure of each faction that makes the game rather asymmetric, which I love.

An excellent, simplistic wargame. Highly thematic.

Have bought most of the first wave of expansions - up to the Filth.

Haven't played it in over a year. Would happily play again soon. Would like to try out the Alliances factions.

Some queries over balance between units - for example the Sand Goblins have a 1 cost ranged with 2 attack that has all my mates WTF-ing, when there are 2 cost 1 attack melee units with the same health. Popular view in my group is that the Sand Goblins and Shadow Elves are OP compared to the other races, and that the Vanguard and Goatmen are Underpowered.

Only other thing that counts against it - 2 player only. When I socialise it tends to be in groups of 3 or more.

If you're going to buy Summoner Wars, this is definitely a decent place to start as it provides 6 factions and a premium board all at a reasonable cost.  Though I'd currently recommend the Alliances Master Set over this one. Rundown of the factions:

Benders: They only have ranged units but those units can put the opponent out of position or put your own units into position.  They also have multiple ways of taking control of enemy units.  Probably one of the trickier races to play with.

Deep Dwarves: Every one of their units are able to spend magic to do something.  Their events revolve around gaining magic or using these abilities for a free cost.  Even the summoner can put cards from the discard pile into the Magic pile but then you'll be limited in attacking that round.

Mountain Vargath: These units are tough.  I don't think any of their units have just a single hit point.  One weakness however is that I don't think they have any ranged units other than a champion.  Their abilities tend to have to do with being on a certain side of the battlefield and getting into a formation.  The summoner would actually prefer to join his units to give them extra attack power.

Swamp Orcs: These are all about their Vine Walls.  These walls will be a pain when you're trying to move into the Orcs side of the field and also help enhance a lot of the Orcs abilities.  These guys also have one of the strongest common units but it does come at a price as it's quite expensive.

Shadow Elves: A lot of the Shadow Elves abilities revolve around advancing on opponents as does some of their events.  They tend to be fragile but also pack a bit of a punch.

Sand Goblins: They seem to have 2 play styles: turtling or offensive.  Turtling can work because a lot of their units have defensive capabilities.  If they go on the offensive, they are also able to move around opponents units.

This game looks nice, and everyone wants to play it at first. Soon it becomes obvious that this game is really for serious players only. I have no real competition in any of my groups, mostly because asymmetric play can blow some people's minds. I do use this as a tool to show people how deep some mechanics can go, and how a non-collectible game can be among the most meta games in a collection. "You only need *one* faction deck to be competitive, but you have to *know* those cards very well."

This is a fast paced, action packed tactical combat card game where you combine quick and dirty fighting with spell slinging in order to take out your opponents' Summoner. It feels like a miniatures skirmish game but it's all played with cards. If you've played Hearthstone then this feels fairly similar. Use a deck of cards populated with minions (Commons), elite minions (Champions) and spells as either units or magic points with which you summon those units, all in order to eventually eliminate your opponents' Summoner. These units can also help to defend your own Summoner and any enemy units that you eliminate are added to your magic pile enabling you to summon even more units. Tough decisions whether to use your cards as cheap units now, or for the greater good later to summon an elite fighting machine.

Even though we'd not played this style of game before (Seasons comes the closest), it was easy to learn from the rules provided and once you have the basics down any edge cases are dealt with by the special powers on the cards. I love the ease of setup and the fact that you can play factions directly out of the box especially if you have no experience with deck construction, but once you become more experienced with the game if you so desire (and have a particular favourite faction that you love to play) you also have the option to tweak the decks to your specifications with reinforcement packs and second summoners. It's not collectible so you get a great gameplay experience from the get go without having to chase after expansion content. I like the variety of the factions, and that they all feel very different when you play. I wish the artwork was better/more interesting as it's all kind of plain and drab, but the gameplay more than makes up for it in spades.

On to the negatives... Movement can feel fairly restrictive as everything is laid out in a grid and it can be tough to keep ranged units out of the reach of melee units when they need line of sight to attack. Corners are tricky!  Some of the units don't seem to have a great cost-benefit ratio – they are fairly expensive to summon, but they only have one or two lives and it's even worse when they are melee units which have a high probability of getting killed off if they fail to terminate their target at first strike. Combat is decided by die roll so if you have a lot of rubbish rolls then you will find yourself in a tough spot to get out of as you are both losing units [i]and[/i] falling behind on potential magic gained from those units. Surprsing combinations of cards, sneaky tricks of your chosen faction, and a couple of lucky attack misses can pull you out of a hole though, so it's best not to think the game is done until one of the Summoners is dead. Can have very tense and sometimes surprising endings. Very exciting!

Also own: Phoenix Elves, Tundra Orcs, Jungle Elves and Mercenaries Factions all combined in base game box.

Fantastic 2 player game!

Love the chess-like tactics mixed with asymmetrical factions.  The factions I've played so far are so balanced.  Not incredibly deep, but the game plays at just the right speed for its depth. 

EDIT (after 25 plays): I really shouldn't like this game by all accounts.  It always surprises people when I list it among my favorite games (when they know what my tastes are otherwise). After 25 plays, though, it has only risen in esteem.  I particularly love that Faction A not only plays differently than Faction B, but that Faction A player differently *against* Faction B than it does against Faction C.  I believe I own 14 of the original factions and this offers endless variety.

When you first open the Master Set box, and realize there's not much in there, it is but an illusion.  The six decks that come with the Master Set belie hundreds, if not thousands, of games worth of variation.  It's hard to classify the Master Set--is it an expansion?  It looks like it's built to house an entire collection; odd for a mere expansion.  Is it an starter set?  Not really, the new factions (the Deep Dwarves, especially) are much more advanced than the Phoenix Elves and their ilk.  Whatever the case, the Master Set is a must-buy for any experienced Summoner Wars fan.

It's sits in an odd place: part chess, part light-wargame, part CCG like characters/powers. For me, it didn't work.

Magic: the Gathering / PokéMon / Yu-Gi-Oh! like game in which you summon minions with different HP in order to attack your opponent's summoner and defend your own. The difference comes from the territorial tactics, as in Summoner Wars you're also moving your minions over the (small) war zone. By which you have some formation play. And the way of summoning is pretty neat as well, using defeated minions and sacrificed cards to bring reinforcements into play around your walls. But apart from that, it's basically the same thing in a new jacket. Though of good quality.

I love this game.  It is a light miniature skirmish game, but played with cards as your army instead of miniatures. It has a simple set up and very easy to take care of.  As for the game-play, rules are easy to learn and each faction has a unique feel.  This is a great set to get started and has a lot of good match ups.  It can be expanded with additional factions and reinforcement packs.  They also can add a bit of deck building, but stands well by itself.

Excellent tactical 1v1 game that will test your abilities to plan, react, and manage your resources.  Very, very solid game.  Each faction deck feels different from the others.  The game even has options for CCG-like deck building if you're feeling particularly masochistic.

Gaming value.  6 new factions in one box, with a nice board.  Fun tactical dueling armies card game with great fantasy flavor.  The dice rolling highs and lows take getting used to, but rewarding due to the variety of strategies and matchups to keep the game fresh. Simple and trashy, while still thinky and satisfying.

Feels like chess with powers. It sounded like something I would really like but it just fell flat. I'm not sure why either. Maybe it's the small text, or the mediocre artwork but it just didn't work for me. I'd rather just play chess.

You should probably start off by downloading the iPhone or Android app. You can play with Phoenix Elves for free in the app which is not in the master set.

If you like the app, you can buy Summoner Wars: Phoenix Elves vs Tundra Orcs first. I find these two clans to be easier to learn with for new players.

Man this game is slick. The cards are characters, spells, resources, and things that actually get played and moved around on a board. Very well done game. I keep calling it Magic the Gathering x Chess, but it is also a 2 player only Race for the Galaxy too in that the cards each have so many purposes. sure youy can know combos of card s in the deck, buyt you are better off seeing what is in your hand nd making the most of it.

Glad to finally play Summoner Wars! Well, it's certainly a game that one would do better with multiple plays. Knowing the different factions is a definite advantage. Regardless, it's just a fun game overall with simple combat but interesting ways with how factions interact. Also, the hand management aspect is very good as well and creates a nice amount of tension. Luck can have a bit too much to say when it comes to combat, but enough savvy control over units can diminish the luck. No different than any other straightforward dice-driven combat. Sorta has a tinge of Blue Moon to it. Nothing really bad to say about SW- it's a nice game!

Simple rules, satisfying tactics, variable games due to the 6 asymmetric races (in addition to the others that were released before the Master set), amazingly balanced, quick play time. 

This usually gets edged out by either Mage Wars or BattleCON whenever I want a head-to-head tactical card game with my son.  I'll never turn a game down, though.

Chess with variable player powers, variable numbers of pawns, and ... painful decisions on when to spend or save. All of the factions I've played so far are well balanced and have unique characteristics. Endgame turns into cat and mouse just like chess, but your "king" (summoner) has enough power to hold out and even win if the dice rolling is on your side.

Sand goblins specialize in getting high numbers onto the board cheaply. I'm not convinced that their additional movement at the cost of possible damage to themselves is worthwhile.

Seems a bit simplistic.

Fun strategic game to play with friends with tons of unique cards that pulls the flavor for the race. A downside is I feel more often than not, the reason someone loses is because the can no longer summon cards. This is also an upside though because it encourages you to not be reckless unless you need to gamble...

There is also an app for this game that is well worth it!

Additional note: previously I thought running out of cards in your deck is a bad thing, but I realize that was the wrong perspective. You yourself can control the speed of your deck depletion, which in turn can allow you to get to important cards and build magic faster.

If you're interested in Summoner Wars, this is the best place to start. For less than twice the price of one of the starter sets, you get six faction decks (15 possible matchups!) and a hard-mounted board, plus the necessary dice and wound markers.

If you're new to Summoner Wars, I suggest avoiding the Swamp Orcs and the Deep Dwarves until you learn the flow of the game. Start with any of the other four factions.

To summun a creature, you need card in your magic pile.  Your magic pile increase when you discard cards from your hand or when you kill an opponent (or even your own) creature.

You can teach this game under 10 minutes. 
Even if it is quite memorable in its randomness, it is not a major factor in the game. Randomness forces you to adapt to always new situations. The times I've lost the game, I recognize I could have run away to fight an other day. :)

Summoner Wars is a great tactical game with a clever hand management aspect to it. It's very streamlined and easy to pick up. 

Every unit you kill goes to the discard, which creates tense moments where sometimes the best thing to do is to kill one of your own units before the opponent gets them.

The races play very differently and seem to be well balanced. I like the way the fantasy tropes are remixed here, and can't wait to try some more.

The iPhone version of this game made me underestimate it. It's a good adaptation except that the slight annoyance of looking at your own cards made me reluctant to discard to my magic pile. But the pacing, and the choices about which cards to build magic with, are central, so not wanting to discard broke the game.

At least, I think that's why I hated the electronic version but am falling for the actual board game. There's also something to be said for the visceral reward of taking an opponent's card off the board and putting it in your OWN pile of cards. Take that, common unit!

Absolutely nothing new, a lot of luck with card draws and dice rolls, but the game is slightly entertaining, not as bad as I expected. There isn't too much variety in the cards and it isn't too hard to memorize special powers. It's also nice how each faction plays very differently, but it's hard to tell how balanced they are. There are some very powerful combos in the events, and I would have preferred that the players were limited to one event card per turn. The artwork definitely could be better.

This is the kind of game my buddy and I should have like. We don't mind dice, we like tactical battles, like card games, etc. I am not sure why, but after playing a dozen or so times with various combos we both just felt it was completely average. It was hard for either of us to point to any flaw other than it is just not that exciting, and we have dozens of other games we would rather play. Sold.

Fast, simple and enjoyable. I have some doubts about balance, and the luck of the draw can hose you--but when the game is brief with minimal rules overhead, it's hard to be too hung up on that.
This is the definitive entry point for the series--six decks is a great value, and the board (while somewhat problematic) is a vast improvement over the terrible paper one in the other starters.

Played the ipad demo many times before I got this one and it's still fun. I think this is much better than games like "Mage Wars", as it takes only 1/3 of the time, not counting the reading of each and any card.

This is a tactical and straight forward fantasy themed battle game that runs fast, which is great! The proof that this kind of games don't have to take ages.

Rating may go up with more plays (still have a couple of unused factions).

I'm quite a fan of this game and own every one of the expansion races -- and the "second summoner" sets of each.  So, basically I own the whole game.  I'd have bought the faction-unique dice if I could have got my hands on them before they became unavailable.  I like some factions, hate others, and still others are kind of meh; but the game itself is solid and offers lots of variation in the way the races play, and tons of replay value.  "Simple to learn, difficult to master."

As others have suggested, Summoner Wars is akin to Magic: the Gathering, in that you summon monsters to the field of play with mana. However, it has the strategic elements of a Chess game as you position your summons and distribute damage among them. Finally, event cards can be used to turn the tide of a particular skirmish.

Each race possesses play mechanics that not only distinguish it from the other 15 armies, but also seem to match the characteristic feel of that race. Some armies require more finesse, while others require an emboldened attack approach.

The turn structure and preconstructed decks seem to favor balance. With the comparatively cheap model of collection to Magic: the Gathering, it's no wonder why many card game players are flocking to Summoner Wars!

RATING: 9
When Summoner Wars first came out, I liked the game, though the paper map was a real turnoff for me. This master set fixes that complaint. I was never a fan of the expansion packs that simply added to existing factions since, as previously discussed, I don't much like sitting around constructing decks/armies. Fortunately, Summoner Wars plays extremely well right out of the box. 

The basic concept is that each player has an army made up of cards that move around the board. It almost feels like a miniatures game on a hex map, except it’s the cards themselves that move around on card-shaped spaces. Not all cards are units; some of them are spells that can be played for immediate effect. 

One of the really brilliant things about this system is how the deck is used. Not only does it contain your units and spells, it is also a source of currency used to bring them into play. Cards from your hand can be placed into your Magic Pile which is used to pay the summoning costs of your units. Since you refill your hand to 5 at the end of each turn, it's tempting to build a ton of magic. However, your deck is razor thin, and if you do this, a few rounds in you will have a full magic pile and no cards left in your deck to spend it on. The balance this requires of you is difficult to do properly, and in fact there may not be a "right answer" in most situations, so it really requires intuition rather than brain-burning calculation.

The second thing that really amazes me about this system is that the different factions are stunningly well-balanced and yet each requires a totally different style of play. The genius of this game is how it takes a simple system and lets all the complexity and interaction flow from the cards themselves.

If Summoner Wars has one flaw, it is simply that it's really only a 2-player game. There is a 4-player option in the rules and it simply doesn't work very well. A true minis game has a lot more ways to accommodate teams or odd numbers of players, whereas SW is simply limited by its maps and starting setups. They are a necessary evil to achieve the incredible balance of one faction against another, but it does sometimes make me wish a "battle royale" was a more practical option.

During the four plays we had, I never had a single real dillemma. All decisions were basically a no-brainers. "Those are cards on the table, these are in my hand - ok, that's the optimal play."
The starting setup for a race is always the same, the deck is always the same (unless you buy addons) - the game almost plays by itself, you just shuffle and roll the dice.

Many clever ideas, but poor implementation.

I really wanted to like this one, but the cramped strategic scope (movement is very limited) and questionable thematic strategies (killing your own troops so you get the magic point) didn't make me love this game..

The races are good, but there are rather limited options for modifications. I understand they've done that for balance purposes.. but i rather had less factions and more variability with deck building.

It's not bad, it's just that i'm a wargamer, and if it's a wargame i'm playing, i need the feel of a war, not of chess with dice.

A fun and well-balanced game.  There is enough luck with the dice rolls to make the game interesting, but the outcome of the battle depends on the tactical and strategic decisions taken during each turn.  6 factions in the Master Set allow for many possible matchups and the game gains a lot by including further expansions and reinforcements.  

Gets better with each consequitve game as you discover new ways to utilize your units.

Super engaging, makes you want to play "one more" game.

It has all the fun factor of Heroscape without long setup.

Wow, what an awesome game.  The description doesn't sound too appealing, using cards instead of miniatures, but this game really SHINES once you start playing.  It's a mixture of fantasy and war, magic cards with movements.  The rules are simple and setup is a breeze.  You choose a fraction (race) out of the six included in the box.  Each fraction is unique with their own troops and champions.  Each have their own unique special abilities.   There are Goblins, Elves, Dwarfs, Humans, and many more to choose from.  The game is very balance with every race.  There isn't a bad race to  choose but some might be a little more complicated than others.  If you get this, start playing with Vargath and Shadow Elves, as their abilities are more simple to understand.  There are also expansions where you can purchase more fractions for the game, for a total of 16 fractions.  You will easily get numerous plays from just this Master Set, but if you like it, you will easily want to purchase the other fractions because they are all so cool.  
I'm giving this two very big thumbs UP.  Rating it a 9 for now but can easily see this going higher will more plays.  
Go get it !! (if you like fantasy, tactical, mag
ic, dungeon and dragons, world of warcraft type games)
Don't get it (if you don't like direct conflict)

The best way to get into Summoner Wars. So much variety and replayability just in this box alone, although you will probably find yourself quickly purchasing additional armies. Have to say, I hate the collectible, money-sink nature of CCGs and minis games, and I try not to even purchase too many expansion-heavy games. I like mine to be self contained investments. But... SW is the exception. It's worth every dime for the expansions, they add so much additional value.
That said, onto the factions!

Mountain Vargath: the definitive brute force deck, they are fun, but can be a little too straight forward for my tastes.  They are the Roman legion of Summoner Wars, with nearly all abilities based on troop formations.

Sand Goblins: My second favorite faction in the Master Set. They have tough units, use camouflage and trickery, and are highly adaptable in playstyle.

Shadow Elves: hard time figuring these guys out , they specialize in stealth and board positioning. I suspect I would enjoy them with further plays.

Deep Dwarves: one of my least favorite factions. Just can't get behind their playstyle. 

Swamp Orcs: tricky, but highly unique, and very rewarding when played right. The Swampies envelope the field in vine growth, using these to draw power, defense, and range benefits, while also choking the life out of the enemy. I can see these becoming a favorite.

Benders: My absolute all time favorite faction of  any of the 16 armies. These guys specialize in manipulation, subversion, and shutting down the opponent through psychic power.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (December 2012)

After playing Summoner Wars on the iPad, I liked it so much that I bought everything for the game I could find. It took me years to play Summoner Wars because I (more or less) dislike the art, however I have found this is a great game and I would love to explore it further. 

I like to play Summoner Wars because it has a lot of depth (mostly tactics but also a little strategy) in a very short time frame. When I have to decide which cards to dump onto the magic pile, I feel like I’m playing Race for the Galaxy. Also it is easy to teach, it has a lot of armies and I love the fantastic theme (although it doesn’t have any real background). Its strongest point is the short playtime, I really prefer to play Mage Wars (or, I hope, Dungeon Command) over this, but many times I don’t have the time.

I love the mounted board, I really prefer it over the paper one. But what I REALLY DISLIKE is that I can´t fit my sleeved armies in the box anymore. They fit but it was bending the sleeves so I had to take it out. :angry: I still don’t understand why many publishers doesn’t allow for this when they publish a game. Mage Wars cards fit perfectly in the box and spell books with all the cards sleeved. Also the cards can be scratched (and marked) very easily. 

I’m not really sold on the customization aspect of the game. I still feel that I’m new to the game, but it seems to me, that the game offers little in this regard as you will always choose the best cards in your army and it is fairly obvious what card is better. I will explore this further, but even if this fails, it continues to be a great game for me just as it is with the regular armies. 

I have only played 3 times with the Master Box, so far it appears the Mountain Vargath and Swamp Orcs to be the strongest, but as I said, I have little experience. I will comment when I have played more times. 
Summoner Wars is a light medium game that I always want to play. I really hope my girlfriend likes it when she plays it.

This is a great game, however as our game gathering are mostly 4 players, this game don’t see table time often. To solve this I bought another Deluxe board so we can play two 2 player games at the same time :D. I don’t want to play 4 player games as I feel the down time would be excessive.

Great game! I won’t ever sell it. My favorite faction from the base set are the Benders. Very hard to master, but when you win you feel very accomplished. I will comment more on the other factions later. 

I love that the game is so easily expandable keeping it fresh (lots of replayability). In this regard it is just like Dominion, you have a huge pool of cards, but you only use very few of them in each game.

Protect your summoner from dying by using creatures, walls and spells. Solid  easy to learn and easy to teach light/medium strategy game. Has a chess-like feel to it. Each faction plays very differently and figuring out how to play each faction most effectively is a fun puzzle onto itself. However, one criticism I have is the heavy reliance on dice during attacks adds a bit more of a chance element than I would like to see in a strategy/tactics game like this.

What an excellent board game! Simple to learn, difficult to master, a game not overly complex that promises varieties. I enjoy it a lot, partially also because i'm a fantasy theme hard core fan. But the game mechanic deserves the credit for making it highly enjoyable and fun. Bought all the expansions immediately after one play. 

[Update 7th Oct 2014] After more than two years of consistent playing it and now having all the expansions to date (with Alliance coming soon), I must say that this is a truly wonderful and excellent game! I have no regret, instead,  full of praise for such an enjoyable game. Thanks to BGG, that's how I came to know about this game. All gamers must give it a try at least once...

[Update 13th January 2017] This is my sixth year of playing this game and I have all the collections of cards, including Alliance, except Second batch of Second Summoners. I will definitely get them later. But what I like to share is simple this: this game is not entirely balanced. not entirely easy to play, not entirely fast to finish, not entirely appealing to all gamers, not entirely cheap to purchase and not entirely beautiful to look at. But it has again and again proven to me, it's one of those rare board games that you just won't get tired of them, in fact, you want more after each game! Lots of varieties, lots of surprises, lots of theme, lots of decisions and options, an awesome game! I will never regret having it and playing it, even though sometimes I loss too.

RATING: 5
Too much random luck in this! Luck in drawing cards, luck in rolling the dice. The dice are also brutal as you need a 3 or above to roll a hit (they tend to often land on 1 or 2 :P)! We did like this game, but the about of luck needed frustrates us! You could be a master at strategy but if you cant roll a 3 and up or draw a good card then you are doomed!

Not quite sure why this game works as well as it does.  It's not all that original (different "races", with cards with life-points, strength, and special powers). Yes, it's a card game played on a board, but even there, it's like a million other abstracts.  But, mysteriously, somehow each time I play I end up with an interesting challenge and a down-to-the wire finish. With surprising evocative narrative considering how abstract it all is. And, obviously, I'm not the only one. I like how the powers match the traits of the race: you need to play to their traits or you'll lose.  My sense is that the designer skillfully made it look easy, with lots of tweaking behind the scenes. I'm not a MtG fan, so even more puzzling why I find myself wanting all the factions. (If the depth or fun vanishes, I'll lower my rating. Addendum 4y later, now playing with my 7yo just as good as I remember.)

A game that gets just about everything right.  It's beautiful to look at, the components are quality, the gameplay is top notch.  It's fun and supremely thematic.  The only small critique is the analytical will AP all over the place with this one.  Aside from any issues there (which have none to do with the game itself) this one is a winner and my new favorite 2-player game.  Simply excellent!

I own all of summoner wars but the master set has my favorite decks. My only complaint (and its probably more a commentary on my ability to play) is I wish I could keep a larger, more epic army on the board at all times. Inevitably when I play the game stalls out until its just summoner vs summoner on the last couple turns.

3/5. Fine. Interesting, light, dice/card hybrid tactical war game. Faction differences add some spice and the game has good pacing. Ultimately though, I just prefer Dungeon Command. Dice adds some unpleasant randomness and I just don't find it engaging. Amazingly portable (if you don't use the optional board), though, which shouldn't be overlooked. If I played more outside my home I would probably like it more.

What to say about Summoner Wars.  First, I am not a big fan of the art at all.  So what?

The GAME is great.  It's got an interesting hand-management/resource system coupled with some "minis-light" rules for a chess-like tactical feel.  You get to chuck dice!  

I fully intend on getting the entire set.  All the little armies, all the expansions.  A few more boards to play on!  The game is FUN.

Appreciate the simple set up and basic instructions.  Also like that the many different decks require a variety of different strategic approaches requiring players to evolve.

Number of players: 2 

Components: (10)
The cards are of good quality. The text is clear and easy to read and the board is beautiful.
  
Rules: (10)
I understood the rules after my first read through. They're laid out in a logical manner and well written. 

Setup: (10)
Each player will have a reference card that displays where their inital troops should go. Finding those troops and their spot on the board is the only real set up.

Area required to play: (10)
The board is huge, but that is pretty much the only area you need to play. There will be dice used, and you will need a small area to hold the wound token, but these things take up very little room.
 
Fun: (10)
This is one one of the most fun games I have ever played.

Theme Integration / Mechanics: (10)
I feel as if every faction plays differently. You have to have a different strategy and apply different tactics depending on the troops that you're using.

Replay Value: (10)
Out of the box I feel like this game has years and years worth of replay value, and with the number of expansions already avaible, I don't see why this game shouldn't be around for decades.

A superb "kill the leader" game, even for someone who dislikes that style, like I usually do. Each faction feels very different, and the game is quick and filled with interesting decisions. The board is too small for turtling, which means there's always going to be combat. Plus, those special powers, and the card-as-money mechanism are a nice twist.

So I *really* don't like this game. I'd happily eject it from our collection, however my husband really loves it. It therefore stays and is my Punishment Game- when I have misbehaved (e.g. massive splurge on unnecessary fabric/ kitchen equipment/ mugs/ Christmas ornaments/ books on tiaras/ insert ridiculous item here) or managed an accidental nutshot to my dear husband, he demands a game of this as retribution. It will therefore stay in the collection, more as a constant reminder to me not to buy fripperies and mind the moneymakers than for actual enjoyment on my part.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Skirmish game with simple rules that lead to lots of tactical choices (along the lines of Space Hulk or Blood Bowl). And then a bunch of special abilities thrown into the mix (along the lines of SH or BB). And then use of dice for conflict resolution and ultimately deciding who wins (along the lines of bla bla bla). I'm uncertain about lasting value - it may be a game you need to devote yourself to a bit, but if you do, six factions should provide some replayability. The graphic design is murky and some of the art is a little iffy (specifically the female poses and anatomies).

- Very very nice playing board, not something I'm used to have with card games

- Card art is sort of bland ... always have to recheck my opponent's cards to remind myself of which card is which unit.  Maybe would've been better if we used minis instead of cards on the actual board.   Maybe it's just that the Master Set races aren't as flashy as I expected ...

- I'm not a huge fan of dice rolls in card games.  However it DOES add some element of strategy because you need to think "Okay, what's gonna happen if I try this and I roll all misses ...".  

So you need to plan for A (Good dice rolls) and B (Bad dice rolls) unlike a card game with no surprises except what's in the hand of your opponent.


All in all I like the mechanics of the game, but I'm not convinced with the Master Set races... I'm happy playing a game now and then and definitely recommend the purchase for somebody who wants variety, but atm it's not a game I'd want to play multiple times per night.   I'll be looking at the previous sets see if it changes my perception of the game ...

Excellent system. The artwork... has thankfully seemed to improve over time. Pfew...

I do have one problem with it though... If you want to spend the time to sit down and play this game, why not upgrade and go for something like BattleLore 2nd ed? Sure, there are some differences (time to set up, movement/order mechanics, length, etc) but... Summoner Wars is good. Summoner Wars isn't great.
2p dueling games like this... there are so many of them. It's such a fierce field to partake in. And Summoner Wars, in my opinion, just is slightly too weak.

Also, those paper mats they give with some of the sets are retarded and hinder play at least as much as they help.

A very fun tactical, head-to-head game with great choices that must be made every turn. Can't say enough good things about it. All of the factions are balanced pretty well. If you know what you're doing, you have a good chance of winning with any faction. My only complaint is that it's dice driven without a way to change your luck, once the dice are rolled. You usually hit on a 3+, so the odds favor attacking, which is good. But, it can be brutal to roll over 5 dice on your turn and only land 1 hit...or none. It happened enough to me, that I lost interest in playing it. Otherwise, great game.

Fun strategy game that combines ccg-style play with boardgame-type tactics. Gains a +1 through being great value to collect compared to other games (e.g anything by FFG) but loses a +1 due to the naff art on the board itself, the majority of the card art is well above average so hopefully Plaid Hat will fix this for the next edition.

I haven't actually played in a few years though our son is now old enough (8 yrs) that we will try it soon.  I rate it a 10 because it is just a perfect game design.  A very simple base set of rules then built upon through the addition of asymmetrical fighting decks.  The only deck building is swapping out a few cards for others in the reinforcement packs.  There is a little randomness in the dice rolling which every once in awhile could swing a game away from you.  Overall though it just stands up so well to repeated playing and is one of the best values in gaming out there.  I also love the use of the tactical maneuvering map which so many of these types of games either eliminate altogether or end up massively overcomplicating how moving around on them works.

Summoner Wars is one of the best games out there.  The Master Set, though a later addition to the family, is really the best place to start.  In addition to new factions, this set added some much-needed components (i.e. a box to store everything and a nice board).

The advent of the iOS version of the game only heightens my deep love for Summoner Wars.  It is one of the only games my non-gaming family will play, and I feel it has helped me be closer to some family members whom I rarely see.  It is also a great platform for learning the game.

The Master Set, as I mentioned, is another great jumping-on point for new players.  Actually, I would recommend it before the so-called starter sets, just because it has more user-friendly components.  

Short story, Summoner Wars is a masterpiece.  Anyone who doesn't know it yet needs to learn!

This is the first game in a long time where the more I play, the more I want to play. I've already played all races at least twice and barely started to explore the possibilities and match-ups.

RATING: 8
At first I didn't like the game much, probably because of the dice. But since my friend really digs it, after a handful of games I think it's better than what I thought. It's tactically fun and the deck building element, though not necessary, can add a ton of strategy, depend on the match-up. 

For high level play though, this game has a problem: It doesn't have inevitability. Players can actually pass a turn without doing anything and some match-ups can lead to stalemate (when the optimal thing to do in your turn is to pass, since moving or doing anything will hand the advantage to the opponent). There are quite a few debates about this problem on the official forums of the game, though for casual players it shouldn't really be a problem. I doubt the designer will do anything about it. Would have been a 9. 

Also own every card post-Second Summoners.

RATING: 5
I'm surprised, that this game has a such a high rating. It's very abstract tactical game with high luckfactor (not a big issue to me), because of the cards drawn and dice rolling. It's just... that the game is kind of boring and is missing true clever moves. I compare Summoner Wars to Neuroshima Hex and when I do that, I see and feel, that the latter offers wider planning, a lot more surprises and it's just more fun. 
Updated: 8/2013: Yep, I've seen this enough... lowered my rating a bit.

Summoner Wars is a fast-playing, action-packed card game for 2-4 players in which they take on the role of Summoners: powerful beings who harness the power of mysterious Summoning Stones to lead their race to conquest on the war-torn planet of Itharia. These Summoners wield terrible magic on the battlefield, freezing their foes in place, draining their enemies of power, and even bringing rains of fire down from the heavens. But most notoriously, they summon their great race's hordes of warriors to the battlefield, to clash in the never-ending struggle for supremacy. A Summoner is both mage and general, and must combine their wizardly might with clever tactics to defeat the enemy Summoner on the opposite side of the battle.

I have only played this twice so far, but I LOVE it already.

Only potential downside I can see is one of two scenarios:

1) I play it a lot and destroy my friends at it, therefore making them not want to play against me.

2) I play against people who over analyze their moves, and slow the game down too much.

Other than that, it is a great game.

Summoner Wars on olnud minu jaoks kõige oluliseim ja põnevaim lauamäng. Hetkel see nii enam ei ole, aga see võib vabalt uuesti muutuda. Võrreldes teiste lauamängudega, olen ma summoner warsi alla kõige rohkem raha matnud. Samuti olen seda ka üsna julgelt üle kahesaja korra mänginud. 100+ mängu iPadi peal, +20 korda arvutis Vassaliga ja arvatavasti nii 100 korda päris elus. 
SW on võtnud male idee ja toonud selle üle 21. sajandisse, lauamängude ajastusse. Selle asemel, et valida, kas sa mängid mustade või valgetega on sul valida 16 factioni vahel ja igas factionis veel 2 summoneri (manaja) vahel. See annab sulle 32 eri võimalust enda leeri valimiseks. Ja kõik factionid on omapärased ja oma mängustiiliga.
Nupud on asendatud kaartidega ja enne iga mängu saad ka oma pakki tuunida (deckbuildida), vastavalt valitud strateegiale. Mäng lõppeb, kui oled vastase summoneri põrmu saatnud.
Siin summoner warsi üle mõtteid mõlgutades, jõudsin arusaamisele, et ta täitis minu jaoks tühimiku, mille oli jätnud yugioh! lahkumine minu elust.

This looks very interesting.  It almost looks like a tactical version of Blue Moon, which we really like, particularly in the way that simple cards for each race can feel so different from each other.  The game looks like it's chock full of specialized cards and tough hand management, which we always enjoy.  On the other hand, I have no idea where to start (or end)...

One of the best games I have ever played. There is enough randomness to keep things unpredictable, but I have never once won or lost a game by chance. All six races are very distinct and each have many levels of strategy to master. 

Note, this is not some teaser product designed to get you to by expansions to fully enjoy the game. There is enough depth in this box to allow for months, possibly years of entertainment. Even if there were no expansions available for this game, I would still be very satisfied with my purchase. 

Every single person I have introduced this game to has verbally said something to the effect of "Wow, that was really fun". This included two complete non-gamers, one of whom told me he usually never had the patience for these types of games.

I strongly recommend getting the Master's Set over the other starter sets available, even if it means waiting a month or so to save up. The Master's Set factions are in my opinion more nuanced than the ones in the other starter sets, and getting six factions adds up to an immense amount to replay value. Also, the full-color board is absolutely gorgeous and easy to move the cards around on. I cannot imagine playing Summoner Wars on some wrinkly grey-scale paper. 

My two extremely minor quibbles are that the cards are about one millimeter longer than standard small cards, making sleeving a pain, and that there aren't enough dice for each player to have their own pool.

I love this game. Just looking at the box makes me happy.

I finally had a chance to play and I had great fun. There is a certain depth of strategy to it and the dice roll can either make or break you. But the uniqueness of each and every tribes is what makes the game difficult to get old. Basically every game can play differently even with the same tribes, as what happens depends on what cards you draw as well.

RATING: 8
The rules are simple, but all of the different factions add some nice depth to the game.  You may get burned by bad dice rolls once in a while.  However, that can be forgiven since you can have some ridiculously epic matches that play in under an hour.

**Revised thoughts 100+ plays later**
Yes, you will get burned by bad dice rolls.  That's starting to drive me crazy so I dropped my rating from a 10 to a 9.  It's really frustrating to set yourself in a good position offensively and then completely whiff on all of your dice rolls.  Maybe I over-committed and needed to account for the chance of missing all my rolls, but still frustrating no matter what.  Sometimes all my opponent needs is one bad set of attack rolls on my part for them to be able to rally back for the win.  It does keep it interesting...

Summoner Wars is probably my second most played game of my collection after chess. It is the BEST - by far - implementation of the "Dueling Wizards" concept. Full of theme, extremely balanced factions, unlimited replayability. 
Each faction is radically different with cool and diverse abilities. 

I especially like the limited size of each deck (34 cards) and the hand management aspect of the game. If I had to describe it with only 2 words, these would be "ameritrash chess". 
 
And don't be fooled by the game's entry: this is not a card game, this is a board game with cards.
My favorite factions are "Deep Dwarves" (master set) and "The Filth" (expansion), mainly because these two are the trickiest ones to play with. 

My son's current favorite game.

My gaming group loves it. But it never clicked with me. The game looks like chess with a fantasy setting. That's okay with me. However, the deck-building aspect is what throws me off for a game that's supposed to be very strategic. The dice-rolling adds another layer of luck to it. Although it might be 30% luck and 70% strategy, for a 2-player competitive play, I just find myself feeling frustrated more and more as the game goes longer. It might also have to do with me on the losing side...

The problem in this game is the high luck factor with the combat dice. 

We had often the situation were a single dice decided if someone wins or loses. I don't like victories that only depends on luck.

Combat can be done without dice luck, look at Dungeon commander or even Berserk. In Berserk you can do damage even if you miss the hit, so you can plan your strategy and cover the worst case.

They got rid of the paper map, which was my only gripe with the previous base sets. So far, the factions in this set all seem very interesting.

The benders are not a hard-hitting faction, but they do give you a lot of control. 

The Mountain Vargath couple mobility with brute strength.

The Sand Goblins are the definition of hit & run tactics.

The Shadow Elves are not very hard-hitting in the unit department, but they have some powerful events.

RATING: 10
I think Summoner Wars in fact uses elements of older cards and miniatures games, but it does it in a pretty original and unique way, the spacial component is great and the armies seem very thematic and well balanced, yet different to play. The artwork, graphic design and materials are all good, but its expandable aspect can make it a little expensive, though. 

Despite luck is present in dice rolls and card drawing I love the feeling of this game, brilliant but simple design all about efficience, good card positioning and luck management, a card you discard to build magic here is a critical choice, every move counts and the player who reads better the match and takes the most out of his event cards, usually will win. Once you get a master set (best place to start) go for some expansions to gain replayability, thanks God it's cheaper than magic. So sad it works well only with 2 players but still an all-time favorite of mine.

I'll track all my Master Set, Alliances and expansions plays at this entry. So far my all-time personal record: 43 Win / 38 Defeats / 1 Unfinished

The Summoner War series provides one of the best light tactical skirmish experiences in a tight, complete, and crazy well balanced package (that is playable in a matter of minutes to boot) that I have played to date.  The armies are designed wonderfully well each having specific units and makeup totally different than the others meaning that games vary greatly depending on the armies and players involved.  It would continue to amaze me how great of a game this is, if i weren't so busy having fun playing it.  One everyone should own, in my book.

[COLOR=#FF3300]I've been entirely neglecting the deck-building option of this game, as I am more inclined on just picking up a faction and playing it. This obviously introduces a conundrum - if I avoid building new decks, I get bored of preconstructed ones.[/COLOR]

I don't LOVE this game, but it's so easy to teach and play, plus it's got so much variety, that I can't help but get all the expansions. It ends up hitting the table more than many games I like better, simply because it's so accessible, teachable and fast. 

This master set is an extremely welcome addition, with the mounted board and the ample storage space. It looks like there's room for 25-30 decks in there! That makes this an essential purchase for anyone who expects to play the game with any regularity.

It really doesn't deserve an 8 rating. However, for being so darn useful and versatile and for being such a convenient way to get maximum utility out of the system (including storage), it gets a bump of one point.

Rating based also on additional decks (e.g. Phoenix Elves and Jungle Elves). 

It plays like a fast fantasy wargame (usually it can be played in less than  one hour). There is a bit of randomness due to the dice and the cards draw, but I think it helps the replayability of the game while keeping the rules simple for new gamers.

RATING: 7.5
There is a learning curve to this game that makes it a little difficult to introduce to new players.  The replay value is high because it takes a few plays to understand how each faction works, and which faction the opponent chooses also matters.  But this means that each time playing with a new faction is sure to be a bumpy ride.  I wish I had more chances to play with experienced players.

Dec 2013: This game didn't see any plays in the last 6 months because the learning curve is so prohibitive and the master set factions take more advanced understanding of the game to use effectively.  Great game system, but I just don't get it to the table.

RATING: N/A
*Feb 2013* I was worried about this due to all the special abilities and trying to keep track of them. I hate doing too much reading and figuring out in a game. 

After one play, this game has potential. There are 31 fighter in your deck but quite a few multiples. In addition, you only have 5 cards in your hand and some are event cards. Finally, On the board I found that it's rare to have a multitude of unites.... I think 6 per side at the most. This keeps the actual area management of the game manageable. Also, I taught the rules in like 5 minutes to a newb. Game has promise but will be a while til I get my wife to learn it.

Review after 30-40 (Master Set) plays - Outstanding.  Amazing replayability.  Ridiculously good value for all the hours and hours of entertainment contained in the box.

There is a reason why so many people rank this game as an essential must have. It is simple, yet has some real depth. This is one of those games where you really marvel at the designers. No matter which factions each player chooses, this game is so well thought out it is hard to argue one faction will consistently beat another. It is toted as a miniatures game without miniatures, but I would say it is a lot more like chess. Would I say this is a gateway game? Yes, in terms of ease in explaining rules. No in terms of this is a pretty serious game with a lot of depth. If you are trying to get a non gamer friend into games, they could become frustrated that there is a lot of skill in this game and every move has real consequences. If your non gamer friend likes chess, sure start them with this. However if not, then start with something a little lite then move on to this to show how far even a simple game can go.

I fell in love with the digital implementation on the ipad.  A friend bought the Master Set & didn't like it: feeling that the random outcomes (die rolls) really hurt the strategic depth of the game.  I feel that the Master set factions are a bit boring alone.  I think you need to have a lot of Summoner Wars to enjoy it!  ... But who wants to pay that much for this?

This is a great game. Its easy to learn and has minimal components (which keeps its price down) but has plenty of tough choices. It doesn't have the depth of Chess but has a similar feeling. There's some randomness (dice, random card draw) but experienced players will usually beat new players. Perhaps the worst luck-based outcome is a wall shortage but. The variety of decks keep the game fresh, too. IMHO, Summoner Wars craps all over Battlelore.

Tactical card game that offers up 1v1 or team based play. The game's core is simple to get to terms with but the depth comes from the natures of each Faction and how they best need to be played. 

Combat favours the attack, which ensures that games don't become too defensive. The Event cards ensure that surpises and combos can be found at every turn.

A wonderful game for fathers and sons and gamers alike. 

The Master Set also offers great value for money.

Superbe jeu de stratégie à 2 joueurs. Les échecs avec des orcs et des elfs! Choisi une race parmis la centaine de disponibles et affronte un autre joueur dans un aréna similaire à un plateau d'échec. La mécanique de jeu est originale, facile à apprendre et à jouer. Il y a beaucoup de texte à lire, surtout lorsqu'on joue pour la première fois avec une nouvelle race donc parfois les parties peuvent s'étirer dans le temps.

Amazing 2-player game.  I love how almost every match ends in some dramatic way.  The different factions all feel really different from one another.  I have considered selling this game and just playing on the app, but it's definitely a game worth keeping around (even though the box is huge).

I also own all the faction decks and Second Summoner decks.  This is one of the few games I will pretty much blindly buy any expansion for, with the exception of the reinforcement decks (don't really see the need to change things up with them!).

Good light fun. I am suffering from a paucity of opponents though and seem to able to only get this to table at game festivals as a quick filler.

EDIT: I enjoy this game more and more each time I play it, it feels like fantasy chess.

Third Play:  This game is a 9.  No question about it.  It the perfect game for two players.  Each faction has different strengths and requires skill to play well.  Snooty euro-players will poo-poo the reliance on dice, ignoring the fact that this is a war of attrition, where both sides will suffer equally in combat.  I'm 1 for 5 even though I have only logged 3 plays.  I have lost by a thin margin and have enjoyed all of my plays.

Not sure how I feel about 2P combat games like this and Mage Wars. Probably want to try before I buy, and even then...I suspect I'd like other games more first, but who knows...

Also try the small faction packs first, they are cheaper and will show whether you like the game.

Okay, tried this game on iPad. Its decent, about on par with MTG and probably better than YGH. I like how cards are used as your mana supply and you always draw up to 5 so its not as much topdecking. Theres still some luck of the draw and dice rolls, but for the most part, the game is tactical enough that a better player ought to win. I didnt like how much reading is necessary. Theres about 60 or more cards total in a game, give or take, and even with duplicates, beginners will have to read a lot to get it. I assume this would improve with more plays, but Im not big on this kind of tactical game with card play. I guess it felt thematic enough and made sense, but it just didnt wow me.

I hate the fact that throwing away 90% of your cards is a good strategy. It's like my deck is simply the champions and everything else is magic pile material.

The dice rolling is pointless. The fact that I only need to roll 3+ means you're going to hit most of the time anyway. It's just there to attempt to create an artificial tenseness.

And it makes a lot of sense to me that in order to get the most out of the gaming system -- and it is a system, a wonderful combo attack of modular deck design and strategic play -- you kinda need to devote yourself to the game as much as you'd devote to either MTG or chess.

I play casually, but I can't compete against people who play this game competitively.  At the same time, I can't fault them for enjoying the game; it's a solid design.  It's a well-designed game that rarely hits my table but that I enjoy playing as a dilletante, even when I inevitably lose.  And I guess that speaks volumes.

I very much like the concept of fantasy chess played out with highly asymmetric pre-constructed factions. But I was disappointed at the lack of interesting strategic choices here, and even the tactical options felt constricted. The weakness of common units, which form the bulk of each faction deck, also strips the game of much of its interest.

RATING: 9
Great 2 player game.  Lots of tough decisions, the magic generation system makes hand management very important.  The grid movement feels nice and tactical.  The summoning aspect can make the game feel a bit swingy but it goes both ways and is surprisingly well balanced.  The factions all play very differently which is cool for such small decks of cards and new factions are cheap.  I enjoy it a lot.

Great value for all the decks that it comes with. There seems to be a fair amount of luck in the card draws and dice rolls, but it plays quickly enough that the luck isn't too annoying. Seems to be more tactical than strategical with the randomness of the card draw, but I do appreciated how each race must be played differently.

I'd always assumed Summoner Wars was another entry in the slew of LCG-esque deck builders out there. It wasn't until I picked up a copy of the Master Set on clearance that I realized it was a surprisingly competent tactical miniatures style battle game, only with cards for units instead of little plastic troops. Another surprise was how it's simple rule set has such a high degree of depth as the complexity and variety of play is shuffled off unto the special abilities of the units themselves. 

The end result is a game that's easy to learn to play, but hard to master as each faction, and it's corresponding special abilities, have very different and unique play styles to explore. There are six armies in the box and they run the gamut from tough, melee brawlers to finicky, magic masters. After a few plays with each you'll develop your favorite and really start to nail down some effective tactics with your deck.

A nice 2 player game of attack, attack, attack. Draw units (cards) from your deck, add some units to the board if you have enough "summoning points" (ie kills you've made on previous turns plus cards you've put aside), move 3 units up to 2 spaces each, make attacks with any 3 units within range (some must be adjacent, archers can attack up to 3 spaces away), roll 3's for hits (with modifiers), add wound markers if their life points haven't run out. First to kill the big daddy up the back wins. As you'd expect, you have constant choices on what type of units to summon to the board, from the cheap short-life units to the more expensive, good-luck-killing-this type of unit. There's some event cards in each deck, and each unit has a special type of power, so knowing your deck well will help towards doing well, but there's only 5 or so types of units, plus some event types, so it's not overwhelming to learn. Waiting and generating co-ordinated attacks or defenses to the best advantage of your special powers seems key. The asynchronicity between decks is appealing, as is the quick game play and the constant choices. Lots of luck along the way but that's fine in this presentation and this length.

After first, and maybe last try: 

First it felt a little to much chess to me, then not, but nevertheless too simple for my taste. Why bother placing and moving around cards, when it's more or less just about who is first to roll high enough a certain number of times. Skip the rest and just keep the dice and it's the same game. 

A nice theme can't save boring mechanics.

At it's most basic, this game is not terribly complicated.  The gameplay is fairly straightforward.  The dice mix things up a bit.  But once you start playing, it gets a bit more serious.  A few turns in, every decision seems to take on more and more weight.  How many commons do I burn as magic?  Which events?  Which heroes?  Who needs to move this turn?

Are there other solid tactical combat games out there?  Sure, but this one is pretty great.  And the master set keeps the options interesting.

Surprisingly good game. Some of the negative reviews for summoners wars frankly don't know what they are talking about. It's definitely not a boring luck fest. There is luck, but it can be managed and mitigated. 

The game is very balanced and ultimately the better player will win more times than not. 

The game plays quickly and is easy enough for even casual players to grasp. A great balance between gamers game and casual game. Each of the sides have various nuances to master.

This game is a lot of fun for it's weight and play time. Highly recommended.

Note: Of 4 plays I've lost every single time. Not a random luck fest.

edit: Game sold as I needed to make space for other games I was interested in and this one just didn't get played much as other people in my group weren't as interested. I hoped to be able to play the digital version, but it seems to be broken and unsupported. Such a shame.

Very simple rules to this card battle game, but the variety of factions (with special abilities and events for each one) give it a lot of depth.

Glad I picked this one up... can definitely see myself buying some of the other factions as well.

Big plus: easy rules, easy to explain and to play. Turns are quick and the goal is obvious for everybody. Nice idea of turning defeated units into magical points.

Summoner Wars helps to scratch the mini-game itch in a fraction of the time and a fraction of the storage space. This is a mini-game with cards. It's easy to learn, easy to teach, and quite a lot of fun.

[b]Comment:[/b] This gives me everything I've ever wanted out of Magic cards but in a non-collectable format. When I was a magic junkie, I used to imagine in my head my army of creatures maneuvering around my opponent's defenses and barriers. Summoner wars comes one step closer to visualizing that thanks to the card grid, where you actually ARE maneuvering around your opponent's defenses. It's almost a miniatures game in terms of it's tactical aspect, but unlike a miniatures game, these cards allow for simple yet complicated abilities that you and your opponent can see right in front of you. As much as I love Heroscape, there are times I don't even worry about the abilities of my opponent's guys just because I'm too impatient to have them read out the card to me from the other end of the table unless it's super relevant to the current combat.

There are cool addon packs that add a minor deckbuilding aspect to the game, which are a great idea, but each time I tinker with the deck I feel like I'm making it less effective than it was out of the box. 

I will say it uses dice for combat, which brings along the sort of randomness that can end your game even if you make every choice correctly. On the whole I don't like using dice in games, but I've learned to allow myself to not be upset when they ruin the best laid plans in these sorts of games.

I like the idea behind the game, and I think tha factions are interesting , and seem balanced.

I ultimately think I am spoiled by my miniatures games experience though.  When I play a tactical battle game, I am just more accustomed to a more flexible options for attack and defense.

The rules of the game really tend to limit the ways you can approach a battle.  I also think many of the various units tend to be pretty samey.

When Summoner Wars first came out I simply loved it. I partially got my first iphone simply so I could play the then iOS only app. Now I find the game to simply have too many expansions and I also don't have people who like to play anymore. Still is a very good game, but I personally feel much of the strategy has been lost over the years as it becomes increasingly impossible to keep up with all the options that are available, much less predict what your opponent might be planning to do. In the early days it was easy enough to predict what Champion or event your opponent was setting up for and how you could strategically plan for it. Now I find the game to be far too much of simply reacting to your opponent or trying to force the action. I haven't played in a while nor have kept up with anything that came out since Second Summoners and Alliances got released. Will probably be selling/trading all this away sometime as I don't foresee myself returning as the game I once loved is no longer there.  Used to play a ton of this on the app and VASSAL.

A mix of standard LCG battle game and chess. I admire what they've done with these mechanics. Cards as units, simple rules, movement, special abilities. There is a bucketload of cards to explore - 16 factions with deckbuilding options and second summoners, effectively multiplying everything by 2. 

It's not as deep as, say, Android: Netrunner and it's targeted towards younger audience, but it's still a very good game. Factions are varied, with their own theme and playstyle, well balanced. There's a lot of tug of war during the game, and it's your strategy and execution that counts. 

I'm not sure about decbkuilding. There are some options for this, but it's only for units. I guess, you can bump your original deck effectiveness by at most 20%, but you can easily break it and make it unplayable. 

The graphics are, well, mostly generic fantasy. They're passable with some decent exceptions from time to time, but overall they feel a bit bland and childish. Event cards just share the face of the summoner they belong to, which makes them hard to distinguish from others. Also, card layout is very unintuitive - you can get over with it quickly, but it's just bad interface.

Still, a very very very good game.

Well, this one has some similarities to Memoir 44 and Battle Lore 2.0, but there are enough differences for this one to stand on it's own. First let me say, I think the factions are ugly. The art work is blurry and dark. I am not impressed at all. The only faction I think looks good is the ram guys, and maybe the psychic ones. I really want to see the Alliance factions to see if they brighten it up a bit. But, that being said, do I love this game? No, but it's okay. And it does some different stuff from the command and colors series. Mostly, the summoning and the high hit probability is great. But the  reason this one stays in the collection is because it is a great game for my kids that are under 10. This game gives them a chance to win, and will certainly help in their dudes on the map progression. Once they get to a place where they can hang on some deeper games, this one will probably be traded for another game I want. It's not that it's a bad game, it is just that it would never be one that I say, "Ooh, let's play this one." I would always pick a plethora of other tactical games over this one. **Wife:6.5

There are many who bash on this game, but it remains my favorite.  I like that you have to make the best with the card draws you get, because you can burn through the deck faster if you want or need to and you won't have people you play ALWAYS playing every game the same way with the same cards first.  I like the speed of play, the cleverness of the abilities, the tactile movement of the cards, and the randomness from the dice to let you pull off those critical hits at the perfect time to win (or even that tough loss when you really thought you had it in the bag).  I don't know if I necessarily need to keep expanding into second summoners, but everything up to that point is giving me more options than I could hope for in most games.  A great, great game that you do NOT have to play hundreds of times to know what you're doing or be great at (regardless of what a couple of reviewers have said).

Includes 'Cloak Faction Deck'.

Quick playing game.  The vulnerability of your Summoner means that you can never quite be sure of victory until the final blow is landed.  Probably the best of the tactical-miniature wannabes that I've played.

Bought for my 14-year-old son for Christmas 2012.

Kinda like simple chess in that the object of the game is to take out the opponent's king (which is called a summoner).  Interesting mechanic is that as you kill your opponent's pieces (cards in this game).  You can use those cards as magic.

Simple (perhaps even simplistic) battle and rules....but the quick play is what makes this appealing.  You don't need to study/know all the cards to have a rewarding game of Summmoner Wars.

After several plays on the IOS, this game is going down rapidly in ranking for me. Each game plays out pretty much the same and does not seem to have much strategic or tactical depth.  Maybe it plays better in face to face so I would have to wait for a real board game session before my final verdict.

Played twice, once with wife, once with brother.  Sounded like my type of game, but left me cold.  I wanted badass armys clashing, but instead it felt like subtly magical chess.

Ok game and am willing to play a few more times before writing it off as not for me.

RATING: 7.8
This is one of those game that needs some plays to really get the feel of the cards but the game mechanics themselves are quite easy to grasp.  The awesome part of this game is the uniqueness of each faction decks which play completely differently and differently against different factions.  One thing is that you have to get used to the fact that you are going to lose units every round but you will get to summon more and battle on.  There is lucky with the dice roll however, they are skewed heavily to the attacker hence the assumption you will be losing units and sometimes it can be better to take out your own to keep an opponent from get the extra summoning magic.  Really good game that I want to delve more into.  Oh and this really is just a two player game.  i can't imagine playing with more.

RATING: 8
This is one of many games that I own that are essentially 2p only and that I think I would love if I got to play often - but that my wife doesn't, and I don't really do any 2p gaming except with her.

So I won't get enough games to be able to really explore the different factions and choose the ones which I like best - but this has many things which I love in games, all in one box. Hand management, many different and varied decks to learn strategies for, and the chesslike feel of moving things around a board to try to destroy your opponent's pieces. I'm less excited by it now than when I first got it, as there have been so many other games I've got into since then - but I'd still be delighted to play this in the unlikely event that I can ever get a game.

The game is diverse with multiple factions to choose from and different builds within each faction. Beautiful art and cool board. It feels very balanced which is an art just by itself. It is simple, really simple but it has a fair amount of depth and between having limited resources to buy units and having to decide which ones to use to build magic, you have far more decisions beyond the battlefield tactics and strategy. Needless to say it is very thematic and flavorful.

Simple, deep, thematic and fun.

I've only played Summoner Wars about three times. I think it was a decently designed game, but as a card game enthusiast it didn't quite hit the spot with me. I think its the resource system that makes me hesitant to call this a good game, but then again I am a total newbie at the game. I'd say this a decent game, but there are better card games out there.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Game was a disappointment for me, although I really like mage wars other cardgames like Netrunner/ Magic / StarWars LCG. 

I am used to card/boardgames in which both players do something in their turn. In Summoner Wars, in your opponents turn you have nothing else to do than see your armies slaughtered.. Which basically makes a game of SW very boring. Each turn is the same, build up, attack, clean-up. And your opponent is just waiting to do the same thing next turn because there are no cards you can play to interrupt your opponent.

While Summoner Wars has all elements to be a great game and looks fantastisch, but I still didn't really feel involved after about 10-15 games and sold it.. because I wasn't interested in playing additional games.

This is a good game but the fact of the matter is that there are better two player games to choose.  Since SW was released several games have come through that I'd prefer playing.  I only play SW if I have a more limited time-frame, otherwise my time is likely to be filled by Android: Netrunner, Mage Wars, or Puzzle Strike.

Jorn ([url=https://boardgamegeek.com/user/Moonhawk]Moonhawk[/url]) bought this game at Essen 2013. Though I took a look at it then, and liked the artwork, I didn't give the game any further thought. It wasn't until I watched the [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT4054SBojw&list=PL189336052F027A32]video series[/url] by Watch it Played - in preparation for my first game with Jorn, that I saw how brilliant this game is.

Both players are Summoners - powerful figures from different races, who battle each other with warriors and magic they can call upon with their Summoning Stone. Their goal is to beat the other Summoner into submission. 

Each player has an equal deck of cards, with the same number of different types (Events, Champions, Commons) but different special abilities. Each turn they get to summon new units, use events, move and attack with three different units (not necessarily the ones that moved).

The magic needed to summon units is gathered by either knocking out units (both yours or the opponent's), or placing cards from your own hand into your magic pile at the end of the turn. This is important deck management, as you don't reshuffle your discard pile. Once you're out oof cards to draw, you have to make do with what you've got left.

The game feels more like a miniatures game, though faster and with less setup time. It is very exciting, and because of the different factions, an additional 'easy to learn - hard to master' element is added. Not only the game itself needs to be mastered, but the best strategy for each Summoner is an interesting puzzle to be solved on its own.

The variety is what really shines about this game. Within a nice, simple framework are some really interesting strategies and combos, depending on the army you're using. What's more, they all seem fairly well-balanced (though there are a couple I haven't figured out yet). Sometimes I feel as though there's never enough "money" available to summon the big stuff, but it's likely just a matter of altering my tactics.

Teach it in 2 minutes, play it within an hour?  Sounds good to me.  I'm not big on 2 player games, but this fits my need for a dueling wizard game.  Each faction feels unique and there aren't 100 different effects to memorize.  Plus if you hate deck construction...no worries, they've done it for you in the base game.  You like it? Great, there are expansions to add more.

The die rolls really did annoy folks that I played with though.  That combined with it being a medium length 2 player game (I prefer really quick ones), turned me off a little.

I blame myself and not the game. But I think this might be one of my biggest disappointments of 2014 for games that are new to me.

I already know that my wife and I don't really like these card-based fantasy fighting games. They are kind of fiddly and have a lot of text on the cards that breaks the rules. And the direct attacking isn't usually very satisfying to us.

So why did I get this? I guess it was shiny and new and inexpensive. And the high ranking on BGG is always intriguing to me.

But it's just not our kind of game. The cards are kind of low quality, so I guess I blame the game for that. But we just don't really enjoy learning all the different factions and reading the various text on the cards. The game itself seems like it'd be good and well designed; however, it's not for us.

My 3 oldest sons actually might enjoy this. I might try teaching them to see what they think. And my wife and I might even try it a few more times. In general, though, if the game has a lot of theme and is not dry and Euro-y enough for us, there is a low chance we will enjoy it.

For such a big boxed game, this seems more like a filler to me, I like filler games, and this one is OK, but it seems most of its allure is in the number of available factions.

Games with different draw decks for each player need to have great gameplay and interactions in order to transform the experience from "when am I going to draw that?" (Samurai and every single CCG out there) to "what can I do with what I have?" (Chaos in the Old World). Had my doubts about Summoner Wars because of the simple rules, but I'm happily surprised by the tough decisions, often resulting in immediate feedback. Manoeuvre is the obvious comparison/inspiration, but I really like the dynamism here with wildly asymmetric powers, small board and move-3 attack-3 instead of Manoeuvre's move-1, attack-1 slugfest that takes forever to get going. Also have always loved the theme of magic armies colliding (from my Age of Wonders days), and love how the different decks convey the characteristics of each fantasy race.

I like the model of providing for a balanced "sealed" play that remains interesting because of all the different faction matchups, instead of forcing the LCG model on you (in fact, the deckbuilding aspect here is pretty weak and constrained -- I think I like LCGs that are like that!). I used to strive to create interesting decks to pit against each other in my CCG days. Need some more plays to gauge the balance, but it seems on first glance that the sides are merely different, not more powerful than each other, requiring creativity in each play (as opposed to CCGs, where I knew Deck A would always beat Deck B).

4+4

One of those games, where I'm still not 100% sure about my opinion on them as I don't play 2 player games often. But pretty impressed so far. I've bought it after trying other 2 starter sets and this seems a nice collection of simpler and more complex armies. 

However it's about the system which is one of the best things I've played - 2 player wise. The rules are simple, armies have a simple structure. Yet not only do they play very differently - they have to behave differently depending on who they're up against. High tactical element of the game give it depth and longevity. You keep on figuring new stuff with every play.  A great package: simple, yet deep and allowing for creative play.

Good Game.
To me it has the feel of a simple miniatures war game mixed with a magic feel. Instead of figures you have cards displaying all your information. A person can build a light game strategy but luck will adjust how your real strategy will play out. After playing 4 games the roll of the dice determined the winner. Most likely we played the game with the wrong mind set. We played with too much planning assuming your plan will win instead of adjusting the possibility of bad dice rolls. The card luck is manageable but the dice luck can determine a winner or loser between equal players. If you play the game knowing this then you will enjoy the game.

Received from an insanely generous secret Santa and was crazy excited to try it as I've heard LOTS of good things... sadly, I was let down. It's not a "bad" game, but after many plays and attempts to find a matchup of teams that makes the game interesting, I just think that this game is not for me, exacerbated by my predisposition against high fantasy settings. Looking to trade.

Everything that is good about Summoner Wars in one big box. The factions play very differently, but are also very balanced. Game play is fast and fun, brain burning can happen, but since there are dice involved, a bit of pushing-your-luck can also be done. Just the right mix of tactics and suspense for my taste.

Akár négyen is játszható (két játékkal), de tipikus kétszemélyes táblán lépegetős fantasy játék. Többfajta fajjal játszhatnak a játékosok, amelyek egységei és eseményei kártyákon szerepelnek. Ezeket a kártyákat megidézve kerülhetnek fel a táblára. A tábla kétszer 6x4-es. Ezeken lépkednek a harcosok, céljuk az ellenfél idéző főhősének megölése. A játék gyors, pörgős, jól kitalált az idézés menete. Érdekes, hogy a hatoldalú kockával történik a támadás, de a 3 fölötti érték találatnak számít, így kevésbé frusztráló a játék, mint egyes ilyen kockás megoldások, ahol sokkal nagyobb célszámok szerepelnek. Nem lehet védeni alapesetben az ütést, így emiatt gyorsan pörögnek az események. A fajok jól kiegyensúlyozottnak tűnnek, meglehetősen különbözők. Nagyon jó kétszemélyes játékot ismertem meg a Summoner Warsban. A fantasy-t és a táblás lépegetős taktikai játékokat szeretőknek nagyon ajánlott.

Második játékra még jobban tetszett. A közepesen nehéz kétszemélyesek királya eddig nálam. Fantasy-t szerető pároknak kötelező.

Plays logged under Summoner Wars: Alliances Master Set cause the box is prettier.

[b]Game in General[/b]: I'm a sucker for asymmetrical 2 player games, and this one is a lot of fun. The factions are truly diverse.

I'm impressed that each match tends to be exciting and feel much, much bigger than what you're really doing -- pushing cards around a table and rolling dice. There's real tactical and strategic depth here that isn't immediately apparent.

The design of the factions is very uneven however. Earlier designed factions are much less interesting and are prone to degenerate game states (who makes the first move??)  and their abilities and such are much more conservative.

Newer factions (Second Summoners onward) are designed much, much better.

[b]Reinforcements:[/b] For me the niche this game fills is that its quick to set up and play and doesn't have much barrier to entry. For that, I'm really glad that the game is designed for an out-of-the-box faction to be fully competitive and playable and balanced, without resorting to deck modification like a LCG or CCG. So I don't like the "customization" this game offers, but it's a shame that some of the cooler units are found in REinforcements and not the base decks.

[b]2v2 Mode:[/b] I like how it actually changes the scope and scale of the game. More units on the board, more interactions, etc. I think 2v2 Summoner Wars is the better game, but the playtime creeps up so far as to compete with heavier games that it wasn't built to compete with, so I'm torn. I think it'd work better with 4 experienced players, as whenever I've tried it it took too long due to newbies.

(4 Design + 5 Enjoyment)

This is a remarkable game ... It is very tactical and requires reacting to both players the cards drawn and the battlefield conditions. 

My son and I play often as we can usually slide a game into about 30 or 40 minutes.

What I am most impressed with is how well defined all the factions are - The Event cards along with each unit's abilities seem to be very well integrated giving a strong sense of unique identity to each army.

I really like the theme of this game.  In a lot of ways this feels like a dumbed down game of MTG on a battlefield grid, which appeals to me.  I've noticed that there's a limit to viable strategies for a given team, so I think most variation in the game will come from the many different armies you can choose from and their individual play styles.  I think 2v2 would also give this game more variation.

Summoner Wars is a cross between chess and MtG. It's asymmetric, with lots of variety. Unfortunately, I find the art muddy and unattractive, enough to detract from my enjoyment. Besides, generic fantasy isn't my favourite theme.

More importantly, I don't find the individual units that interesting. I might have half a dozen orcs or something (which I'm not that excited about to begin with) and they all have the same or similar stats, so there's no sense that any of them matter individually. By contrast, I prefer a game like Pixel Tactics, where every card feels uniquely useful and each choice feels meaningful. That's not to say that Summoner Wars is a bad game. It's just that the design is a bit timid for my tastes. Everything blurs together more than I'd like.

For me, this game suffers compared to Dungeon Command, which occupies the same space and which I'd much rather play. The only advantage Summoner Wars has for me is the quick and easy nature of it (grab a deck and be done in 20 to 30 minutes).

1 play, Origins demo

A fun, light tactical miniatures-type game but without the miniatures. Interesting play, although I suspect all that die rolling might get annoying if I roll poorly!

--- Summary ---
The board is a grid of card-sized rectangles. Each player has a unique faction deck, with a specific summoner, starting creatures (specifically positioned on their side of the board), and deck. On your turn,
1 Draw Cards - up to your hand size (5). Only go through your draw deck once!
2 Summon Units - by spending mana in mana pool, stronger minions costing more mana; they are placed adjacent to the walls on your half of the board.
3 Play Event Cards - by spending mana
4 Move - up to 3 creatures (2 spaces each) orthogonally (but not new ones, which basically have summoning sickness).
5 Attack - up to 3 of your minions (not necessarily the ones moved), adjacent or ranged depending on creature. Combat is a simple die roll: roll a number of d6 based on the attacker type, scoring hits on rolls 3+. Creatures take hits until they reach their maximum (varies); when you kill something, put it face down in your mana pool.
6 Build Magic - place any cards you don't want from your hand into your mana pool.

Play alternates until one Summoner is finally killed.

Light, tactical card-based skirmish game. Lots of factions are available for purchase and each has a unique flavour. Some degree of deck customization is possible. Despite the hype and popularity of the game, it fell a bit flat for me and I ended up trading it away. 

The Dungeons and Dragons tactical skirmish game is likely better suited to my tastes, but I recently read that Wizards of the Coast is abandoning the product.

I'm spoiled by Magic: The Gathering.  I was a long time M:TG player and would still be one if not for the cost (both in money and time) to remain competitive.  But the variety of cards, even just in one new set, have spoiled me for games like this.  It is fun for a short period of time but eventually I miss the sheer volume of options a game like M:TG can give you.

Summoner Wars is plenty good in its own right.  There is a large amount of strategy involved and I love the blending of the miniatures-esque mechanic in the movement with a living card game and the amount of customizability available within each of the classes balanced with some of the locked features such as opening board position and units.  The different classes offer a variety of flavor and play style (though not necessarily balance) and for a cheaper entry fee and upkeep over M:TG this is a fine game.  It's just not one that can hold my interest for an extended period of time.

I can't say how many games I have tried over the years and this one is easily in the top 3. A fantastic game of confrontation with enough factions to last forever, even without any form of deckbuilding. The game is tensed, short enough, deeply strategic and tactical, balanced, it has everything, not a single flaw (except maybe art, sometimes?). I cannot believe that the game is not discussed even more, to be honest...

This game reminds me a lot of chess, but combines the random factor of dice.  For some dice are not good for the very fact they are random.  For me, however, I like it as it can make a win against a superior opponent possibly (although still unlikely).  That, plus the plethora of different races is what puts this in a whole other universe than chess for me.  (Not a fan of chess really...)

Very good light skirmish game. Units are cards, so expansions are cheap and easy to produce, though some sort of board is required so it's less portable than it could be. Art is OK.

The best thing about the game is that each faction plays very differently -- there's real variety here. The game system is elegant, with real trade-offs around timing and big units vs small ones.

Combat is dice-based and with low numbers of dice (3+ to wound, generally) so the luck-factor is very real and can be wildly swingy. It's short enough that it doesn't matter, but the game is still more of a filler than real meat. I'm a little disappointed that demolishing opponents' walls is so difficult as to be rarely useful: a missed opportunity for an alternate strategic path.

Downgraded to a '6'. I just never find myself wanting to play it. Using cards as miniatures is a pain because it's hard to identify what is what at a pop.

Love the tactical nature of the game play (moving your units around the board).  Each faction plays so differently and offers a ton of variety in terms of match ups.  I also like how you have to learn to combine the event cards with your units at just the right time.

Normally I don't like random draws and the hand management that is involved in the game but I know that I will (usually) see most of if not all of my cards.

I don't really care for the art work.  The first card I looked at was the Fire Drake for the Phoenix Elves.  It just looks muted and incomplete.  Not a lot of detail.  It's a negative but it is so outweighed by the fun we have playing the game.

The dice can play a large part of who wins and my son has been pretty upset when his biggest attackers roll all misses.  The game plays pretty fast and we can just play again if there is a quick loss.

We have picked up a quite a lot of games over the past two years and my son's top 10 list seems to fluctuate a lot.  This is one of the few games that I know will be on both of our top 5 lists.

We have been wanting to make a playoff battle royale between our favorite factions.  Need to get started on that...

Update:  My son still likes the game, but we ran into a few games where neither of us wanted to move.  And the dice are still a problem sometimes.  Actually, I think the biggest issue is that my son is becoming more interested in video games.

Initial thoughts : I purchased thinking maybe this would replicate the feeling of the days of Magic past.  It has not so far.  It's a different animal.  It's fun but is going to take many plays to see the tactics of the decks.  We are not sure if we are into that.

Where to begin?  Straight foreward yet strategic gameplay, let's you decide how much money you want to invest (you can play with two armies for under $20, but will find yourself buying more for the sheer fun of it)and the state of the game is always changing, one minute your up, the next your down and it goes back and forth in a  completely un-contrived way.  The game is ridiculously balanced with 16 armies, all of which are fun to play.  Been playing for over a year and show no signs of stopping.  If you haven't bought it yet, what are you waiting for?  I'll play it with you right now!

Fantastic dueling card game. Combines great elements of Magic with board games and an LCG card collection system. The mechanics are excellent and the component quality cannot be beat. It's essentially Mage Wars Lite (even though it arrived on the scene first).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Streamlined mechanics that don't get in the way of game play combined with a surprising level of strategy make SWs an amazing game. Also, the addition of reinforcement packs, second summoners, and an expansive mercenary pool combine to give this game an easy-to-manage though relatively robust deck construction element. Love love love.

This is Magic the Gathering meets Chess.  The game is exceptionally strategic and well thought through.  I have very few complaints except for my similar complaints I have about chess, where I feel it is a good game but too competitive for its own good.  

The game does have many less strategic elements, however, like dice rolls and card draw which help take the edge off the competitive feel.

Summoner Wars can be a bit of an expensive game to get into (at least it seems that way if you're not already into CCGs or miniatures), especially if you've got the collector's gene.  With six races and a mounted board, the Master Set is definitely the best starting point for this excellent game, and very good bang for the buck.

The box is huge and awkwardly shaped, but I'm glad I'll (eventually) have one box to store it all in.

RATING: 7
A fun game with innovative design decisions. It has interesting tactics, strategy and deck building. It doesn't even feel like a card game. More like a light modern war game (ex. battle lore) or a customizable chess game with theme and dice. It also has some very neat mechanics in this game. Very portable and fast setup time, plays fast also. A really good game makes you think about it when you are not playing it. 

As an old magic player I think this game has playing skill but of course a lot less deck building freedom. One negative thing about this game is that you don't have any freedom over spells. I miss some freedom in deck building. I don't know yet how much luck there is in the higher echelons of play. I would also like to see a little more creativity with more spells.

In this game you can just buy on deck and try to master it and then update it a little over time. It also has a good mobile version.

Summoner Wars is my favorite board/card game of all time. It's easy to learn, teach, and play, and there's phenomenal depth there for anyone who wants to become a master. The luck element can be strong at times, but there are plenty of ways to mitigate it, and it ultimately only makes this wonderful game even more thrilling.

I've written about it a few times, and will continue to do so in the future: http://spacebiff.com/tag/summoner-wars/

This set gives you six great factions.

The BENDERS are all about mind control and forcing enemy troops to move, get stunned, switch sides, or even just disappear into thin air. Their own soldiers aren't all that great at straight-up combat, which is fine because their entire goal is to avoid straight-up combat.

The DEEP DWARVES focus on meticulously keeping track of their magic count. Their abilities are all impressive, but many require an extra magic investment. However, they're one of the few factions with an extra economy option, in this case sometimes pulling cards out of their discard pile and into the magic pile, so as long as they manage their troops well, they can keep fighting long after their opponent has run out of magic.

The MOUNTAIN VARGATH are one of the Master Set's more straightforward factions, focusing on sheer might, lots of melee attacks, and crowding the opponent's side of the board. These goat-folk are a very brutal and enjoyable faction, especially when delivering a beat-down to one of the trickier factions.

The SHADOW ELVES are one of those tricky factions, focusing on ambushes and surprise attacks, as well as truly jerky event cards that will leave their enemies seething. Stealing magic is fun!

The SAND GOBLINS are also a bit more tricky, with their focus on strong common units rather than a few champions. Camouflage and scavenging are the order of the day for these tougher, meaner goblins.

And last are the SWAMP ORCS, which have a special mechanic in their many Vine Walls, which they can gradually spread across the board until they're summoning troops onto their opponent's side and blocking all sorts of movement, while their own guys move unhindered.

Seriously, this game is incredible. Each of the factions (6 here, 16 in total) is distinct and fun to play. This is the best two-player card dueler out there.

This isn't the worst game, it just... isn't the best? I don't know, it's fun, and there's some vareity, it's nice invovling how much strategy there is, and balanced better than you'd think, but... feels repetitive and unsatisfying. There's not much to get excited about... maybe that's just me though.

Amazing. The Master Set is excellent and the other factions I've tried have really added a lot to the game. The different factions all play differently so they offer a ton of replay value.

Update 10/01/2012: Still absolutely love this game. Even when playing with the same factions again, every game is still much different. The custom faction dice really add to the visual appeal of the game.

This game makes Memoir '44, all 2 player CCGs, and Blue Moon obsolete FOR ME (Blue Moon is definitely not obsolete, stupid comment).  It plays like a hybrid (not really but in my head) of all of those, and plays just as quick, with more interesting decisions than the others.  Learning how to play the game, learn the strengths and how to attack with each faction, plus how to attack each faction with the combinations makes this an expansive amount to learn.  This has 10 potential.

A finely crafted army duel game, each army plays with different feels and strategies, with combat being at the right level of unpredictability to allow swings and surprises without it overwhelming the whole game. I don't plan on doing any custom deck building with this, but I don't need to - it plays wonderfully out of the box, with surprisingly sound balance (with the possible exception of the Vanguard, although maybe I'm just bad at them).

Rating is for 2-player, out-of-the-box. I've played a little bit of 3+ player, and I'm fine keeping it as a 2-player affair.

It's a simple game at it's core, with just a few things one can do per round. Summon monsters, play event cards, move and attack. So the pace of play is nice and quick in this two player game. 

The game revolves around building magic by discarding cards or killing the opponents cards and using that magic to summon onto the board. It's basically a tactical battle game played with cards instead of miniatures. The various factions are really interesting and create a game with lot of depth and variety.

I think Plaid Hat did a decent job of designing a one-on-one skirmish game that is affordable but does not lack in variety and thus, replayability. This game is all card driven, but does offer a significant amount of depth between different factions. Although I am not convinced that all factions are well balanced, the variety of factions alone is noteworthy. In a day and age of Kickstarter-driven mania that offers a box-full of minis with absolutely horrendous game play, it is nice to see that Summoner Wars represent the antithesis of companies that focus more on presentation over substance. It is refreshing that one need not fork out hundreds of dollars for a good product. Two thumbs up for Plaid Hat and Colby Dauch.

Summoner Wars distills wizard battles into a miniature-esque board game without the miniatures. It's quick to play and the variety of differing Summoners without the need to (though you certainly can if you choose to) deck build makes this a great game. I may never get to the highest level of skill required to play this game (and all the different strategies that come with that), but it doesn't stop me from enjoying it!

Shortest game of Summoner Wars, 2 turn victory! Boosted my summoner by 4 attacks, flew over a wall with an angel, then proceeded to bash an out of position opposing summoner.

Special shout out to Plaid Hat Games, excellent customer service!

Summary: The most played game from my collection. I have read through a large spectrum of reviews of this game and I can understand the general concensus that the game is heavily luck based, I disagree with reasons to support my opinion. It is a game of calculated risks and the element of deck building greatly balances the assymetrical start of the game. A great game for its genre. END


Long version: Firstly, I will acknowledge the vast number of comments regarding luck. Yes, unfavorable dice rolls can ruin a game but a single game doesn't represent any meaningful statistics. In the end, strategy weighs more heavily, and I do not believe my opinion is unfounded. The number of plays I have on this game is in the hundreds. I have spectated even more games. My win percentage isn't close to 50%, it is definitely in my favor. I also only play this game with other experienced SW players. With a much larger sample size than the average reviewer, I can safely say that dice rolls account for very little in a match between experienced players. In newbie games, just like in EVERY game, luck seems to be the deciding factor.

This game is best played with serious board gamers. It is easy to pick up and learn, but unless a player is familiar with every card in the game, the element of blind luck increases significantly. The rules are newbie friendly, but the game is deceptively not. It is an absolute bore to play with a newbie, and as such, I cannot give this game a perfect score. 

Those of you who have played DotA, the learning curve is similar. It is easy to play against someone of your own skill level, but mastering the game is dependent on the most seemingly insignificant details.

Seeing as how I regard this game as a serious competetive play type game, I will only post brief remarks about the theming. It is great but once you are absorbed into the game and have passed the point of blaming the dice, the only thought is the strategy. The game is best played as a first to 3 wins, win by 2.

Summoner Wars is definitely fun. For what it wants to be, it does it super well. I'm just not totally sure if this is my type of game. It's a 2 player game that is very chesslike where you summon monsters and try to take out the opponents summoner through attacking and monster movement. The game plays really quickly and there are a couple different races to play in the master set. Each race has a very different strategy than other races. From what I can tell though it's pretty well balanced for being asymmetrical. What I just don't like about it is that although you are playing against somebody, it feels pretty solitary and quiet. A nice strategy game, but not something that I really get amped before and after I play it.

This game is one of my favorites in the moment! I really got addicted to it. For me it combines the Pros of an Tabletop game (the movement on a map to get to strategic places; every Unit has its special ability, every faction plays different and has its own flavor) and a Card Game like Magic (it plays very fast, you have to manage your resources). I just love this game! If you have not tried it yet give it a try. And to play it two on two is a totally different challenge. Takes a little bit longer but its worth it time

After 11 plays, Summoner Wars earned a PERMANENT PLACE IN COLLECTION

Based on two plays. An amazing tactical combat game with cards that plays like a deep miniatures game, and lasts just 60 minutes.

You can customise your deck and there's a huge choice of factions, but it's obviously cheaper and more portable than a miniatures game. A big thumbs up from me!

RATING: 7
Summoner Wars hearkens back to days of Magic, only without the collectibility aspect to it, and with a few more constraints in the board and the set up.  It's a crazy-addictive game of battling against other creatures, tempered with the randomness of the die rolls to keep things a little unexpected.  The deck-building aspect is nice, too, since once players get accustomed to the basic factions, they can step up their game by adding some new characters into the mix.  This is a very cool system with a lot of replayability built into it.  I'm impressed.

Summoner Wars is a fast-playing, action-packed card game for 2-4 players in which they take on the role of Summoners: powerful beings who harness the power of mysterious Summoning Stones to lead their race to conquest on the war-torn planet of Itharia. These Summoners wield terrible magic on the battlefield, freezing their foes in place, draining their enemies of power, and even bringing rains of fire down from the heavens. But most notoriously, they summon their great race's hordes of warriors to the battlefield, to clash in the never-ending struggle for supremacy. A Summoner is both mage and general, and must combine their wizardly might with clever tactics to defeat the enemy Summoner on the opposite side of the battle.
\13\\13\
Strategy shapes the composition of each deck of cards and how they are used. Tactics determine the effectiveness of those cards in battle. Call walls of stone to protect you in combat and serve as magic portals for you to summon your warriors. Call your forces forth and send them in a surging wave against your enemy. Cast spells that bolster your forces and cut down those who would oppose you.

Victory can come only from the death of your opponent's Summoner...

I really enjoy this game, it reminds me of times when I played Heroes of Might and Magic on my PC. 

I love the fact that each faction plays very differently, Summoner Wars has an almost infinite replay value - no two games will ever feel the same. The battles can be super tense and exciting. Just keep in mind that sometimes the random outcome of dice throwing during critical moments can be super frustrating. Still, there's nothing quite like this game so definitely check it out.

I really enjoy this game.  I can see that there is probably a decent amount of depth if you go into the deck constructing aspect.  This one works well for getting your Magic the Gathering-playing friend into board games.  Also, you can check out the starter set to see if you are into it and then plunge into the Master Set if you liked it.  I have several expansions for the game as well.

Update as of June of '15:  Although I don't exactly disagree with my previous posts, for some reason I just don't enjoy the game as much as I used to.  After learning Mage Wars Arena, I now see no reason so even keep this game in my collection.

A fantastic 2-player game that I just don't get enough opportunities to play.  This game has effectively replaced any and all "collectible card games" for me as it satisfies much of what those games do but with much greater ease of entry.  Games are fast, tense and have that added tactical element that creates a unique and memorable game every time.

This games about brutal tactics and nothing more.  Like everyone else, I get in the mood for some RPG or fun when I see the box, but when I play, I quickly remember that it's all about tactics.  I think this game could use a WWII reskin that would really benefit it.

This game lacks intensity, fun, and character.  And it is perhaps so well balanced that when two players of equal skill are playing, the game can actually be really boring.  For what it is, I will rank it an 8, but I feel like I am being generous because most of the people I play with would give this game a 7.  

The strategy and tactics are solid and if that's all you're interested in, there's a good amount of game here, but it just didn't grab me like an actually war-theme would have.

Terrific game. If you ever want to play a tactical game with different characters/races in a pretty short time with short setup-time this is it! Love how you need to chose to use the cards; magic or units? My only negative point is that I dont like that you can kill your own units to get magic - it just doesnt feel right. For me it would have been better if you just discarded the card instead of putting it in your magic pile. This way you still have the tactical options, but it would feel right thematically. It would also make the champions a bit weaker which is a good thing imo.

Summoner Wars is a great series and the Master Set is the perfect point of entry. For the cost of an average hobby game a new player gets quality components and 6 balanced factions to play with.

Love this and need to play it more. Fantastic two player game which plays quickly and has surprising depth.

Random game is random. the only NON random element to the game is set up. with the factions being sooooo unbalanced set up can determine the winner in almost every game. 
A truly crap system.

I liked it, need to play again, but the first play didn't have that "WOW" factor I heard about so much with this game.

Great game for two and has both lots of flavor and theme yet is simple to play and grasp. That seems to be a combination that keeps getting rarer for some reason. So many games are either really thematic but overly complex or, on the other hand, streamlined but bland. 

Summoner Wars gets it right.

I'd love to play this one more often.  It's easy to teach and play, but, when I can get a wargame to the table, there are usually several others higher on the list that I would prefer to play (I'm looking at you, Mythic Battles.)  Still, this is a good game, and I've had fun acquiring the additional factions.  Hopefully, I'll have it on the table a bit more often in the near future.

A box chock full of goodness. A great 2 player game, and the master set has loads of variety. Some races are WAY better than others but it really doesn't hurt the game. If you're looking for an alternative to Magic for an evening, you could do a lot worse.

Good strategy for two players, great (though can be long) with 4.  If you're not inclined to play games with math, you may want to avoid this one - but for those that don't mind a little number tracking (and really, it's not a lot) then I'm not sure you can find a cheaper little strategy gem than this.

RATING: 9
Lots of strategy with just a touch of randomness thrown in.  The fire/flood/festival cards really spice things up and promote &quot;screwing over&quot; the other players by growing their shops.  And the price just adds to the value.  If you don&#039;t have one, pick it up!

RATING: 7
An interesting tile-placer with some unusual mechanics. It sometimes seems to end just as it is getting going. The outcome is a bit too dependent on the luck of fires, floods and festivals. I play with a house rule that no events take place on the first turn as being wiped out so early can be fatal.

I really like the CheapAss HipPocket games, and Agora I think I like best of all (second only to Nexus).  This has carried over well from college.
  
It's an unusual tile-laying game (and tile-laying is a mechanic I'm found of): the tiles can be haphazardly laid out, instead of staying in an orderly grid.  After a while it really does look like a Greek town.  :)  And I need some souvenir of my Cheapass non-color game days.

A neat little tile laying game / area control game with some great artwork by one of my favorite artists.

Its not clear that this isn't a very, even trivially, simple race game.

There's also considerable promise that small rules variations could lose the simple race game problems.

RATING: 8
Cheapass Game's best Pocket Game ever. It's tiny, has only a few rules to learn, yet is eminently replayable (to me) because of it's great place anywhere, any direction, in anyplace rule (unlike all other games, where you may place it anywhere, but really means somewhere connected to another card/tile in some direction - this game would seem to be fine in you placed one card down and walked into the next room over and place a card.

Agora asks - what if you could lay a tile anywhere on the table and at any angle?  Lay your tiles in such a way as to create a market with lots of open stall space.  But beware opponents laying tiles to block you, as well as fires and floods that wipe the slate clean.

Not the heaviest or most exciting game, but for the price, this can't be beat.

Seems broken if played as is. Shouldn't "last licks" be invoked, giving everyone the same number of turns? We were all close in score until Player 2 far exceeded the scores of players 3 and 4 on his last move, denying p3 & p4 a turn to compensate. Email me if you've played and see something wrong in this, please.

RATING: 6
Decent tile-laying game with the clever twist that you can place tiles anywhere.   Literally.   Anywhere.   Any orientation.   Anywhere.   Trying to stitch up other players by blocking their exits (income) and forcing them to obtain the largest shops (risk of fire) is a big part of it.   It's a bit thinky, actually.   But, unlike Carcassonne, you can't draw your tile in advance (because of the pre-printed events) and that slows it down a little and causes some AP.  I'd play this one again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Agora is the best of CAG's Hip Pocket line. Unlike most tile-laying games, you can place your cards pretty much wherever you please -- the only strict placement rule is that if you place cards side-by-side they have to mach gridwise. Also, Agora tends to be pretty cutthroat -- which I like. Perhaps the best "under $5" game out there. :P

(After [b]2[/b] plays) A tile-laying game with an innovative mechanic that lets you play a tile literally anywhere, including at odd angles off the grid. A decent amount of depth, tempered by randomly occurring events, makes this a surprisingly competitive abstract game that is worth trying, despite the dry and uninspiring theme and graphics.

[b]2 year verdict:[/b] This is a cute little game, but it is essentially an abstract, and there are a lot of other flashier and more interesting games out there now. Keeping it along with the other [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgamefamily/73/hip-pocket-games]Hip Pocket[/url] games in my collection, but don't anticipate playing it again anytime soon.

Okay tile game, it seemed to progress too obviously and with only 2 players, we never suffered or gained and event. Nice ideas, it just wasn't a stretch. I'd rather play it with a die to improve the odds of an event happening. The game needs some kind of balance or levelling. Maybe playing it with 3 or 4 makes it better.

* Played 2 times. I have a feeling this may border on being a great game -- for $4. Tile laying like you've never seen before. Immensely enjoyed my first playing with 3 players. // My second playing was with 2 players and it wasn't as fun. The first player seems to have a huge advantage since most of the time players can reciprocate the last action. (You take 3 pts from me, I take 3 from you etc.) DON'T PLAY WITH 2. [BuyF. Sell.]

It is hard for me to play Cheapass Games because they do not look exciting--they look dull.

However, since I just paid Delta Airlines $25 for a checked suitcase, Cheapass Games are starting to look a lot better.  I can easily slip a few of those into a carry on. Agora is one of their Hip Pocket Games--and so it is, by measuring about 4"x4"x 1/2", and weighing an insignificant amount.  

Still I took it reluctantly, and was then surprised by a clever mechanic and strategy. There is some luck involved with the onslaught of sun, fire, & flood, but that is so with nature, so fits the game.  

I played 3 games in one sitting and not only plan to take this when I travel, but I will look into more of these Cheapass Hip Pocket Games--especially a good idea since their games often share the same components, which the purchaser supplies--so I can make them as small or as large as I want.

I rated this as a good travel game, but pulling it out on game night will never happen.

Great little filler for 2P to 4P.  There is a significant chance factor, but it's fun yelling "C'mon FIRE!" or "No fire no fire no fire" depending on who has the biggest market.  Also, it is oh so very pleasing to watch the expressions of orthogonally minded people when you place a card just [i]slightly[/i] off square.

One of my favorite Hip-Pocket games. A very unique tile-laying game, where the tiles can be placed just about anywhere and however you wish. Works very nice, and provides a tremendous depth to the strategy, yet still has some luck to shake things up with a 1 in 4 chance of something happening (good or bad). I would really like to see a high-quality version of this someday, with thicker pieces that stay where they are placed better; a tile-laying game should not be made of thin cardstock.

Because Agora doesn't limit you in how you play the tiles, the game always seems to play out in a completely different way.  An additional level of fun can come from gambling on the random events to either give you a point boost or cripple your opponents.
The only serious failing I'd really care to cite is that Agora is so abstract that it can become a bit bland after a few plays.  Still, I've played this with 3 players many times and I always find it's a great way to spend 15 or so minutes

Ok game to play from time to time. I’m not a fan of the tile placement mechanic, but I find refreshing that in Agora you can them in different orientations. There is some luck with the events, however I like them (except the one that gives you money), as I feel they are not uncontrollable.

I really dislike that the game ends when a player gets to 50 points giving the advantage to the first players as they can play a whole extra turn. Nowadays I don’t enjoy games in which you need to attack the leader to win, especially if the leader can be wrecked rather easily.  

For now I want to play again to properly assess if the game has more depth that initially thought.

I played the Camden version. It was a lot better than I thought it would be. Sure, the theme is completely pasted on, but it makes it much more attractive than the abstract Agora. It is interesting how aggressive the game is, which makes it a little problematic for a multi-player game. If it was just 2 players, that's one thing, but with three or four, it seems like you can't pull too far ahead without getting completely beat down.

In 2-player games it looks like the first player has the uper hand all the time.

Unusual tile laying options take some getting used to but are the key to making this a unique strategy game. It's tense and exciting too, due to the random, sometimes catastrophic events (fires, floods). Plays okay with two players but is much better with three. It even becomes attractive with the help of some glass stones borrowed from another game such as [i]Bazaar[/i]. [11 plays]

The edition I have is called "Agora", which is the greek word for marketplace.  2 to 4 players.  20 minutes.  A simple tile-laying game.  Fairly abstract, but fun.

A "free form" card(tile) laying game was a nice variation. It's one of the more enjoyable(some might even say "playable", but anyway..) games from Cheapass line up games.

RATING: 6
Very cool game; I'm especially fond of the "play anywhere" aspect.  The random events do add a bit of luck, but it helps force players to invest in multiple shops and keep their options open.
Update: after a few plays over the years, I've lost some interest in this game.  Unique mechanic, but not a spectacular game built around it.

There's some weird spatial assessments required here which makes the game twitchy. I've only ever played multi-player and it felt too leader-hitting for it to be a favourite.

RATING: 8
Excellent quick light-medium abstract, without feeling like an abstract, IMO. I'm expanding shops, opening shops, making money, and cutting off opponents. Wonderful game. I adore the Camden version.

Not a great 2-player. Though I really enjoy Camden, we had to "Jones' Theory" it out of our collection.

Fantastic little abstract whose theme fits well.  I use wooden Risk pieces as the markers, use Yu-Gi-Oh card protectors, and the whole thing fits in a TrickRTreat box whose contents have been used/discarded.

RATING: 7
An outstanding game for what it is.  Inexpensive (well not if you buy glass counters like I did, but I wanted it to look nice); quick (20-40 minutes I would say in general); and with a nice combo of luck and twists of fate.  At first, I thought the player going first had an advantage, but I can see that this isn't true - there is just enough luck factor to keep that from being true. But if you aren't thinking, luck will probably not save you.

RATING: 6
Pretty good; the entirely arbitrary layout option might be better done away with, as playing far from the main arena in a way that can't possibly be linked to it seems to be advantageous, and there's an unfortunate "king-unmaker" tendency, wherein play will tend to focus on stopping the person in the lead from winning - leading to game-theory side effects of "well the person who's winning isn't after me, so if I don't stop them then the *other* player has to", and it all gets a bit messy. So probably better played two-player.

Simple rules and fairly quick gameplay. The mechanic of playing cards ANYWHERE makes for varried play. Better with 3 or 4 than with 2.

I really, really enjoy this game. It is quick, scales well from two to four players, can be taught in a minute, and has a LOT of possibilities. An excellent abstract strategy game, with actually a rather endearing little tacked-on theme. Great buy at $4!

Played with partnership rules, this is an excellent game - it has investment and speculation, clever spatial play and a bit of bluff.  Needs a few tweaks to get it working exactly right but the core is excellent stuff.  Probably good as a two player.  Too easy to bash the leader in a multi-player.

Doesn't the guy that goes first nearly always win?  The "first wins" idea seems primarily to be prevented by a fully random activity.  Might become more challenging as you and opponent got into it.  Of course, that would require more plays, which are hardly the way I choose to spend my time.

RATING: N/A
The rules are correct, though perhaps unclear.

The cards which are part of a shop but have no counters on them -are-
removed by a fire. When I say they don't "count against you for fires" I
mean that they don't add to the size of a shop for the purpose of
determining which shop is the biggest, and thus which shop will be
destroyed by fire.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Clever "tile" game that allows you to place cards almost anywhere. I like this with 3 or 4 players, because if one player starts to run away with the lead, it's hard to stop them without help.

One problem is getting the cards to stay in place. For such a positional game, a slight nudge can affect how cards can possibly fit elsewhere.

RATING: 6
Good 15-30 minute game.

Update:  Downgraded from 6.5 to 6.  It just doesn't hit the table. It probably would if it were prettier. What can I say, I'm shallow.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 4
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 4
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 4


Overall - 4

Great, but underplayed game because it's not 'pretty' and can be overanalyzed. I think it's a good combo of a screw-you puzzle game with the unique dynamic of allowing a very free style of tile placement literally anywhere on the table in any orientation.

I like it. Quick to play, easy to set up. The interesting non-grid mechanic allows for creative ways to mess with people. High luck factor, decently high "take that" factor. I expected some lawyering on what's touching and what's not, but it was luckily straightforward and was fine for what it is. Definite imbalance with festivals, causing premature wins.

A huge game in a small package. The slight twist of allowing players to place tiles in any orientation makes this a very interesting entry in the tile-laying genre, and definitely enhances replayability. Or, at least I assume it would; I got rid of this because my game groups judge it based on its (lack of) packaging. I did find the random events to be infrequent enough to be a bit frustrating when they do happen (in the same sense as a series of bad die rolls), but it's not a huge issue. I have found Power Grid pieces work quite well to signify ownership :)

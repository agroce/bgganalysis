GAME: BattleCON: Devastation of Indines
RANK: 195
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
(this is the entry for all of my BattleCon stuff unless otherwise noted for differentiation purposes).

An absolutely massive amount of content, and a great game of bluffing/anticipation, chaining actions, and fast action *once players get up to speed*. That caveat is the double edged sword; the first handful of games will be rough purely because folks are new to the system and there are a ton of characters who all have different strengths/weaknesses. Understanding how to read a character from their stats/actions deck is not an easy skill to grok as a new player. The second ding I have against BattleCon is that it's a lifestyle game; it will reward players who spend a massive amount of time playing the game; L99 sort of acknowledges this with league play and that sort of structure. It's not a game for casuals.

The upside is that it's a game that accomplished what I didn't think was possible; taking an experience that is largely split decision and chaotic and translating that into a slower analog medium. Heavy on the employment of Psychology and a mix of strategic/tactical planning, BattleCon brings the feel of a fight and planning moves and doubting what the other player will do to the tabletop realm and the plethora of characters give the game a level of replay-ability that is bang:buck better than most other games on the market today.

A solid PVP game with no fluff.  Every character we've played seems incredibly different from every other character, but all still capable of smashing everyone else.  I haven't found any that we've tried that I didn't think 'wow, that character is amazing' after the round (even of the losing side).  It's quick, it's focused, and the mechanics are so smooth.  Brilliant game.

Had to bump this up to a 10. Me and my son have played this constantly since we've purchased it. Probably between 50 and 70 plays by now, and not getting at all stale. There is such an abundance of characters and game modes, the variety is impressive. Equally impressive is how distinct each character feels, and how clear the myriad character abilities are. Truly excellent game design.

Although I haven't had the opportunity to play it very many times, I've really enjoyed it so far. I just wish I could coax the people I play with into trying it more. My favorite aspect is the huge variety in character choices. The aspect keeping it from hitting the table often is the learning curve, but hopefully we'll get everyone on the same footing eventually.

I could see the rating for this climbing higher as I get more chances to play.

I'm a huge fighting game fan, so this game scratches a particular itch for me.  It's a clever tactical game with a ton of characters and really solid mechanics - it might not play like a traditional fighter, but it really has a similar feel where you are controlling movement and priority.  Very well-designed.

RATING: 8
I'm not the type to go weak at the knees over a box full of stuff, but Devastation of Indines is a big box, impressively full to the brim of stuff.  So much stuff that I fear I may never use it all.  

I like the idea of duelling games, but up until now the only one that has stayed in my collection is Knizia's En Garde.  DoI shares the concept of a track with player pieces moving only forward or back.  There is also card play, but in a rather more complex form.  Each character has a small deck of unique "style" cards and a bunch of generic "base" cards.  Each round players simultaneously choose a style and a base card and in combination those cards determine what each character does and to what effect.  The style cards work really well to give each character a distinctive feel.  Choosing a pair of cards offers plenty of possibilities for clever play and for second guessing your opponent.  

The florid sub-manga artwork is not really to my taste.  Card and other component quality is good.  The rules make an admirable attempt at programmed learning, though I did skip the speech bubble rules explanation by cartoon characters and went straight to the regular rules.  Those are clearly written. The suggestions around which characters to play first and card choices in the set-up helpfully get novices into the game with a minimum of fuss.

I'll rate all these BattleCON games the same, I'm sure.  Does a good job of capturing the feel of 2D fighting games, with many interesting fighters and environments, with lots of different moves in different combinations, to ensure games are always different.  I love how tactical it feels when I'm deep in the middle of a game.

It's like Street Fighter the card game. I really enjoy this game because it has enlightened me to what makes fighting video games so interesting to the players. It's taken the priority, rock/paper/scissors and spacing of traditional fighting games and slowed it down so I can actually keep up with it.

RATING: 8.9
The amount of stuff you're getting here is just staggering...not only does this really deliver on converting 2D Japanese fighter video-games (Guilty Gear, BlazBlue, Dark Stalkers, Street Fighter, etc.) into the board game analog, but it also incorporates team modes, and solo play ('dungeon crawl-ish'). Loads of characters, and I do get a kick out of how the game subtly mocks that Europhilia you find in a lot of Japanese anime and video games. Really well done dueling.

If BattleCON: War of Indines was the game that I was waiting my life for, then BattleCON: Devastation of Indines is my gaming Nirvana.

The board is better, the cards are better, the tokens are better, the rules are better, the artwork is better, the graphic design is better, etc. Seriously, if you do not own this, you should, and if you do own this, I hope we can throw down for a few matches sometime.

Simply astounding game of outwitting and predicting your opponent with no luck (save for a single coin flip). Only downsides I can think of is that there might be TOO much for those who want to understand everything and it might be difficult to interest many people in a dueling game, even with the extra multiplayer modes. With that said though, the replayability and excellence in design showcase this as Talton's magnum opus.

The box has a burst corner that is currently taped up. I threw out the original insert because it was absolutely terrible, and went with a custom tuck box solution.

Got War of Indines first and loved it. This makes it even better.
So many great new characters. I love that their abilities seem so unique.
The components are really high quality. So much nicer using the health dials, rather than the old counters in the original game.
With all the new characters plus different arenas, there is so much variety each time you play.

Great fun. This is an inherently easy system to learn and to teach (which is great for me as the board game explainer in our group) but has SOOOOO much depth once you do learn the simple rules. We have played through all of the simple (Flight 1) characters so far. Adding solo rules to the game makes it even greater for me.

I really like this game.  It feels fresh and different every time I play, both because the mechanics are very unique and the variable fighter options are seemingly endless.  

I will say though, that the game play is not that intuitive, though the rules are fairly simple.  This game is by far the best when played against an opponent that has played the game before and knows its nuances.

I absolutely love this game, every character has a very unique feel and there's a surprising amount of strategy you can come up with characters (especially as you get up into the higher flighted characters). It feels pretty well balanced, even the more lopsided feeling fights are also pretty close as well in terms of how much health each character has. The box also comes with A TON of content! Play modes, characters, boss fights...It could all keep you busy for an extremely long amount of time.

I don't get this played as often as I like though - I don't often have game nights with 2 players only (the player count this is best at) - and a couple folks I've played with get really upset when they whiff their combo while I hit them with 6 damage OR the other person doesn't appreciate direct conflict with one person right in front of them....Know your gaming situations!

2P, Easy, Short, Fun

Street fighter the board game. Match a generic base card (dash, jump back, strike, etc) with an attack or move unique to your character. Compare the combined valued on your cards to your opponents, move along a line of 7 spaces, do damage, pick new card pairs and repeat until 1 dies. 
Very simple game but you need to understand your character, and which card pairs to discard at the right time. Otherwise game will be sloppy and boring. Lot of characters. If you know the game and know your opponent and can predict their moves the game becomes extremely fun and competitive.

BattleCON is a real gem. One of those very rare games that offer elegance and depth AND tremendous replayability!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.75
Pros:
 - Flavourful characters and flavourful gameplay.
 - To each attackpair there are usually at least two direct counters and two non-counters in your opponent's hand. This turns the game into a clever tactical game of outwitting your opponent
 - Simple gameflow

Cons:
 - With usually 35 options total and 15 options in-hand and no luck or hidden information the game is completely determined and would be easy for computers to bruteforce. Since you can usually dismiss a few of your opponents cards and a few of yours it's possible to count through the most likely scenarios and choose the best option. So AP is rewarded and quick play severely punished
 - Since it's determined and doesn't have too many options I question the game's deepness in a 2 fighter game. It does have great variety in fighters though
 - With the great amount of text to go through learning a new fighter or reacting to your opponent the game is a lot of work that greatly punishes you if you miss a detail

Great game, awesome production values, but it's hard to get into. Whilst some games take a while to reveal their strategies, BattleCON almost demands you figure it out straightaway. Without knowing what you're doing, it's random and not fun.

Played 3 times with the same player. Tried different characters each time. I can see it getting better with more plays with the same player. Maybe I didn't like losing all 3 times, maybe just cos I'm lousy. But I felt it was missing something. I think it has to play in 30 mins for it to be fun and good value for the time invested.

The duelling gameplay, on the seven space board, is both accessible and engrossing. The card-pairing mechanic, card recycling and perfect information make this a game of decisions, of bluffing, positioning and looking for the less obvious courses of action.

Absurdly good value too, with so many fighters, options, variants and play modes in the box. High quality components.

Based on 1 play:

This game might just be too stressful for me to enjoy.

There's just so much information to take in for EVERY play. I can see how once you get to know the decks better and play regularly with someone, the bluffing aspect might be more fun, but my first game just felt too much like guesswork - to the point where the bluffing game felt indistinguishable from luck.

There are some fun choices to make here, but at the end of the day, I'm just not sure I WANT to play a game that promotes this level of analysis paralysis.

Street Fighter:  The board game.  I wish I could get more people to play this with me, it feels just so elegant that it's as much a bluffing game and getting inside your opponents head as anything else.

RATING: 7
While I have really enjoyed the game so far I am going to disagree with the vast majority of people on here and say this game feels nothing like a console/arcade fighting game. The only thing they have in common is two fighters fighting in an arena. Everything else is different or the certain parts that are similar this game does them in a different way that doesn't give the console/arcade fighting game feel/style. Now this isn't really a knock against the game. It still is a really good game. I enjoy games that have different characters/teams to chose from that play different from each other and have their own ways of going about winning. I enjoy competitive 1v1 or team vs. team games. I enjoy games that have a high skill ceiling and that the majority of the time the better player will win (playing bo3 also helps this and makes things more enjoyable). I enjoy games with human skills, such as: being able to read the opponent. This game delivers on all of these points. This also goes for War of Indines. 

Having said all that I am super curious to see what heavy online play does to this game. When people that are serious about playing well and winning come into contact with other people doing the same I wonder what will happen with these characters. Once people get to put a lot of time into playing the various mu with a single character I wonder what the mu charts will look like. I wonder what the tier rankings will look like. Will we end up with 10 or so viable characters that if you want to win tournaments you really should be playing one of those characters? I think it will be fascinating to see what happens once competitive players will be able to get in more games more often against other competitive players.

This next point goes some what in hand with the last point. Currently I'm worried about balance. Not because I've discovered any imbalances but because of the extremely large amount of content in the game. Right now there are 48 non promo characters. Each character has a 3 versions of themselves (one for 1v1, 1v2, and 1v3). Each character has 2 super moves to choose from. There are 12 arenas that change up the game. There are 65 strikers to chose from that augment your character. And there's an equipment mode where you can buy gear for your character before the fight. With all that much stuff it would have taken a decade of serious gaming to play test all that stuff. So I would be very surprised if online play doesn't uncover some crazy lopsided set-ups/match-ups.

#1 favorite game. Takes all the counterplay and prediction of fighting games and translates them to a board game wonderfully. Has a steep learning curve, but is well worth it.

You get a crazy smorgasbord of stuff for this game - admittedly more if you backed the kickstarter than at retail...but still, you can't complain with 30 different characters plus boss variants AND solo/coop. The amount of variety is staggering with this game. It also helps that it's pretty fun to play, too. Getting used to the timing of effects is a bit of a hurdle, though - not as intuitive as it could be. The excellent manual explains it all in detail though, so it's just a matter of digesting the rules.

A challenging and fun game with lots of variety. The characters are really varied and require lots of different play styles. The matchups I've played have mostly been balanced. I'm not so much a fan of the solo or multiplayer modes, but the standard 1v1 game is one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had.

The number of fighters in this game is phenomenal.  This game gives me the feeling that I'm back in the arcade playing a game of Street Fighter II.  I love the variety, and it's a very quick game to play.  The game is deep, and simple mechanically.  Tons and tons (and tons) of options ensure that you will get a lot of miles out of this one.

There are so many characters and so many ways to play that you may very well not experience everything this game has to offer in your lifetime.

One knock is that -- like chess -- the game is best played between players of similar skill levels, which is often difficult to achieve. The game doesn't solo well, even though it's offered as one of its myriad options.

The best 2P game that involves visceral movement and attacking on an one-dimensional battle field, which can lead to being blown over and mind-screwed by your opponent. I cannot get enough of this, and neither can anyone who I introduce it to. Doesn't get enough love from me simply due to the fact I play multiplayer games more often than 2P.

Haven't had the opportunity yet to mix characters from other boxes. Keen to try out the boss battle modes and BattleQuest at some point.

Complex characters paired with a simple "2D" (single line) battle arena board. Hand management is mostly about trying to find combos with characters and then potentially some bluffing or reading of your opponent once both players know the characters well. Lots of phases to the combat including an ante phase.

Thick cardstock and components but seem to need sleeving.

I get what the game was going for, it just didn't work for me. Ultimately it felt like advanced rock, paper, scissors. That's a bit unfair, I know, as there are clearly more tactics and strategy than that, but at the end of the day it's a guessing game.

The only thing keeping this game from a perfect 10 for me is that there is no "real" Solo mode. You CAN play the DungeonQuest mode for Solo or play around with some Variant AIs, but at it's heart, it is a 2 player game. Maybe the BEST 2 player game I have ever owned. SOOOOOO much good stuff in the box with literally infinite replay-ability.

One of the greatest board games I have ever played. Fighters are all actually different and always a joy to play, even if they are not your playstyle.

If you are looking to start with BattleCON, this is certainly an excellent place to start.

~Shreds guitar on an old man's grave~ There is just so much awesome stuff crammed into this box. Amazing support and communication from the publisher.

Not really my kind of game. Mastering the character's fiddly bits should only take a game, and the replayability only then comes from having lots of characters. It's a good implementation of that kind of thing, but it's not super exciting. 

A game of breadth instead of depth.

What a unique concept - turning one-on-one fighter video-games into a card game. You've got the diverse range of fighters with very unique effects, but the need for understanding the underlying combat system behind all of them. Field awareness, combos, cancels, all worked into cards.

Frankly, this would rank higher IF I had some opponents I could play this with regularly. Still fun to introduce to someone (and fairly quick to teach,) but it takes multiple plays for the genius behind the game to sink in - especially when you get to the higher-level character choices.

Street Fighter the card game! Actually it's probably much closer to Blaz Blue, but you get my drift.

Playing the game is easy. Resolving it is an exercise in logic and math.

So my more calculating mates love this game. In particular, they enjoy playing it as a 2v2 dramatic battle. 

The characters are very well balanced for 1v1's, however when it comes to 2v2 dramatic battles some characters are just better suited to support / tank / dps roles.

My only gripe is that I find this game a bit overwhelming when I'm tired.

RATING: 7
This, in my opinion, is a vastly superior version of Yomi! For those that haven't heard of either, it's basically Street Fighter/Mortal Kombat "The Card Game." I feel it's better because there is more characters (BC has 30 characters vs. Yomi's 10), more strategic depth based on the fact that BC includes positional character movement on a board, there is no luck-of-the-draw element in BC, there are many variants and modes of play (arena battles, 2v2, 2v1, 3v1, boss battles, a solo/co-op dungeon mode, and more), and all of this at a cheaper cost. When you consider that you would need to play the game a minimum of 30 times just to play every character a single time in a normal 1v1 match-up, I think this was clearly made as a lifestyle game for people who don't want to invest money into CCG/LCG lifestyle games. I can easily see people who are into this playing it thousands of times. If an owner created a PnP board, the game can easily accommodate 6 players in a tournament and/or have three 1v1 duels going at the same time. If you somehow managed to get bored of the 30 characters in this release, there is going to be a re-balanced edition of War of Indines (DoI's predecessor) which adds another 18 characters, and another expansion with even more characters in the pipeline. To really get the most of the game you will ideally want to know how your character and your opponents character play to have an intense session. As some people have said, there might almost be too much content in this box, yet you can find it at online retailers for less than $60. Even though it is a great game, there are some 2-player games I like better. The main detractor for me is the number of permutations you have every turn given that it's a game of perfect information. Based on the amount of time this game wants you to devote to it, I don't know if I would ever find the time or would even want to if I could find the time.

This is an amazing game. It's rich in theme & strategy without relying on luck. The artwork is gorgeous, and the components are quality. There's so much in the box that I know I can play this game daily for a year and still won't scratch the surface. Even though the pacing is much slower than a video game, it still mimics the feel of Street Fighter or similar. It's quick to grasp the basics, but takes a while to really start being able to get a feel for the game and pick up the pace. It will take a long time to work through all the characters and types of play offered up in this box. FLGS Purchase.

This is my favourite card combat system. It is incredibly simple in concept but (as the old cliche goes) difficult to master. The box is filled with extras and goodies as is the way with Level 99 games. 

Unfortunately I do not get this to the table nearly as often as I would like, but will hold on to my copy in hope to get a league system sorted.

My only criticism is that the box insert is useless once everything is punched and unwrapped.

This is literally the best tabletop game I've ever played.

It's really easy to pick up and learn the basics after a quick round or two. After you get the basics down the game comes very naturally and gets very deep.

The game just has a really nice learning curve and it has seemingly indefinitely replayability (even between the same two players playing the same two characters).

Simply my favorite tabletop game.

The attack pair system introduced here is brilliant! The mix of deterministic combat and tactical positioning that is all open information really creates some intense, heady gameplay. The cast of characters are unique and many, so there's sure to be one or more that will suit your playstyle. Some additional game modes are also available should you want to explore even more of this games' potential. I particularly enjoy the BattleQuest solo/coop dungeons and Boss Mode scenarios.

[b]1st play:[/b] DEC/14. I did a lot of research on this game before buying without playing. I based my decision on the value and variability mentioned by fans of the game, and it seemed to be an ultra-powered version of Knizia's modest but clever Duell. And an 8.57 average rating must mean something, right?

Well, I have only played twice so far, once the tutorial game (which we finished off), then the same matchup a second time free-form. It. was. awesome. The tutorial (despite a few apparent math errors) explains a ton of the game in playthrough style, while also answering FAQ style issues. The second game had Kevin up 20-11 on me, before I brought him down to 12. He backed me into a corner, pummeled a few times while I countered once. Kevin up 2-1. Then  dropped my finisher Sheet Lightning for the win.

The game is a Street Fighter type game, and as such is best played quickly in my opinion. I get how AP could KILL this game, so I think that players should have a one-minute sand timer to keep things. After all, a speedy fighting game with the occasional error seems theme appropriate to me.

I've only done the [b]basic[/b] starter matchup so far and I had a blast. I can't believe there are 28 [b]more[/b] fighters in the box. Mind boggling. 

Highly recommended so far. Incredibly glad I bought it. And I am *not* a huge video game/fighting game fan.

[b]8th play:[/b] DEC/14. I'm not awesome at math, but with 30 fighters in the box, assuming you want to play each fighter once against every other fighter, you'd play 29 matchups with each fighter. There are 30 fighters. 29 x 30 = 870 playings with no repeats. So far I've played Eligor against Shekhtur 4 times, and would happily play that matchup at least another 10 times, and likely 20-30 more times. Conservatively, I can get about 10000+ plays out of this... uh... whoa.

Eight plays in, and I'm already seeing amazing comeback victories that come from careful play and watching for opportune times to strike. I had been hit for 6 and 8 damage by the King character, and lots of smaller hits, and was down to 2 life. But by carefully watching my opponents cycled out cards, and using some evasion and careful use of Concentration marker, I managed to whittle him down to 4 life then dropped my finisher for the win.

This game also handicaps well. One player more experienced than the other? No problem. Have the experienced player take a new character. Or give the new player the "Ex" bases or "Beta" bases for more powerful strikes and higher priority. Or give the new player more life to last longer.

[b]20 plays in:[/b] We are, only now, beginning to use the second set of six fighters. 23 matches in, and we've only used 11 out of 30 characters, and I honestly feel no need to go into the the last three flights (18 characters) for at least another 15 plays. I still haven't played the first 12 characters with beta bases or arenas!

[b]30 plays in:[/b] On my 34th playing of this, I finally played a 3rd Flight Character, which means that, after 34 plays, we've only played with 13 out of 30 fighters. Mind boggling. I still love this game, and now that I've taught Cornel, Jonathan, Bryan, and Justin, I should get lots of plays in the future.

A card game that feels just like playing Street Fighter. I love the theme and art of the game. The base mechanisms are easy to grasp. The difficulty is in the different powers for each fighter. This game is filled with lots of different game modes and a ton of fighters.

The game succeeds well in what it sets out to do. Although an interesting experience unfortunately not really my kind of game.

BattleCON has a serious learning curve and is very prone to AP. But it is worth it to stick with it because once you understand the base moves, you have a good chance at battling your opponent and pulling off really interesting moves. The games get really tight and tense the more you understand the characters and head games become a big part of the game, much like an actual fighting game. I have not played the solo or boss versions of the game, but the game plays well with 1v1 or 2v2. The game can be a bit of a brain burner even after understanding all the rules, so I don't want to play it as often as other games, but it is still a great game.

I'm not a big fan of the whole hidden choice, "anticipate what he chose", rock-paper-scissors style of game.
I like the variety in characters, but the gameplay itself just feels flat.

Update - I only played the PNP, but bought the game after playing and enjoying Exceed. The game is really great. Nice variety (solo, co-op, head to head, 2v1 with crazy bosses). The fighters are each super different. Not every match-up feels fair, but the game usually takes 15-20 minutes, so you don't have to suffer for long.

Purchased on a whim after being blown away by Pixel Tactics (from the same designer), it has proven to be one of the best gaming purchases I've ever made. The design is brilliant, capturing everything that is fun about fighting videogames while axing everything I can't stand about them. Yomi used to scratch that itch, but will never come off the shelf again now that I have this.

Can't wait for the new edition of War of Indines, and I've bought all the expansions for this, but I really don't know why. There's enough content in the base game to last me for the rest of my life. It's just one of those games where you want to own everything for it and give every last dollar you can spare to the designer. My only regret is that I never paid attention to Level 99 until recently, but I certainly will from now on.

If this actually was a 30-45 minute game, I may have a different opinion. However, my experience was closer to 1.5 hrs per match. Each player has about 15 options to play on each turn. Each of those options match up differently with each of your opponents options. This can lead to some amazing AP. I experienced AP in this game, and that is very rare for me (I usually play very quickly). 

Had I played with the same opponent 30-40 times, this feeling may have changed. But noone I introduced the game to liked it enough to do that. Especially when Summoner Wars is also an option.

It's amazing all the stuff you get in this box!  It took me over 3 hours just to sort everything!  With the 30 fighter and all the game mode this game have almost infinite replayability.  I paid less than 66$ for this game and I think its a steal!
The solo dungeon crawl mode is fine but the 2 player head to head is really how this game should be played!  This really feels like playing a video fighting game.
This is one of the best 2 player game I have played!

This game is good. Really good. It feels like a near perfect implementation of fighting games into a turn-based system. The game is super tight, it's got the mindgames/reads and the slight long-term strategy. It's got basically infinite characters and tons of replayability while rewarding familiarity very strongly. The game system is overall intuitive and easy to learn. 

That being said the production of this game is garbage. Straight up. The box was caved in because the insert didn't fit, the insert didn't have enough room for the character kits and the kits themselves were flimsy and came creased. The dials and some tokens are printed misaligned, and the dials don't fit together well. The cards have that shitty oily feel and came scuffed or with residue on them, some reference cards were miss-sized. However, the board was done well-enough and the standees were good. I'm kinda annoyed by terminology (Beats and Soak vs Rounds and Block) but nothing terrible. Some wordings are overly long or un-intuitive. Board for Fate of Indines came super warped. I've probably dropped at least another $150 on sleeves and deckboxes for organising everything.

A huge selection of characters, stages, and game variants will have you exploring the depths of this box for years.  Also, the large game box is absolutely overstuffed with components / content.  No shortage of value per dollar here.

My second-favorite two-player card game,  barely (and I mean barely)taking second to Android Netrunner.

Highly recommended for those who enjoy two-player dueling card games and a fan of old 2D fighting video games.

This is a game I've played, once a week at least, for over 4 months.  I've done marathon sessions and one-shots and I've loved every minute.  Can't wait to own every character for this series, it's a life-time keeper for sure.

BattleCON started really strong and is only getting stronger. The variety of characters is stunning and a joy to discover. I have concerns about balance, but just like a good 2D fighter I know to withhold judgement until I have seen more matchups. So much fun!

Like a Street Fighter card game...
El que he vist (videos Watch it Played) no m'ha agradat gens (molt lent, moltes excepcions i poders diferents a tot arreu, etc...) La gracia de un joc de combat com el Street Fighter és el ràpid que es juga i l'habilitat dels jugadors, aquesta sensació aquí no es transmet en absolut, és més un puzzle a resoldre. No entenc com pot tenir tan bona puntuació a la BGG.

My initial impression of this game began to take shape well before the first play. Simply put, I began to realize just how much content there is within this particular box especially when you include all of the additional content (i.e., Extended edition, Striker).

As someone whose played their fair share of fighting games in the 90's and 2000's (are we calling those the noughts?), this game is the first to really pay homage to the elements that make competitive play competitive -- the deep need for positional play, pokes, a bit of gut predictive play, knowledge of what your character, and more importantly, your opponent can do. Throw in a few special powers who thematically and mechanically seem to work, and you've got yourself a winner in terms of theme!

Mechanically, this game is a prime example of card play which stands up to the moniker simple but deep. While the framework for this game is robust, it is also relatively straight forward and seems like it won't get "in the way" of the action (once gotten used to). That action is much about deduction, intuition, guessing, and double-guessing what your opponent might do, reacting accordingly.

In terms of aesthetics, this game looks great. Beautiful art work partnered with functional design make this an easy-to-read beauty.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Update (Spetember 2014): I'm finally starting to intuit action-reactions, not in a rich predictive sense (since you can never fully get there), but I'm definitely feeling as though my decisions are much more meaningful (i.e., I'm beginning to make sense of the better action-reaction possibilities and making choices accordingly). Furthermore, I've finally dipped beyond the First Flight -- while it was only one fight, fighting as Voco, I'm definitely getting excited about playing the less straight forward characters (note: my favorite decks in Blue Moon are Aqua, Pillar, and Flit if that tells you anything).

RATING: 8
Soo big game. Need much more time to learn heroes, try different modes. Strong 8.5 at the beginning. 

Update: This game is great, but not for me. Too much predicting what my opponent will do in next attack, match consume to much time, it is very hard to land "fun and entertaining attack". This game is like: calculate your moves, calculate your opponent best moves, calculate your counters etc etc then pick two cards... ok, nothing happend repeat or I deal 2 damage to my opponent. No entertaining for my...sadly, mayby I should try Exceed. I think this is great game, worth to buy and try. So much content in the Box, but I dont have time for mastering game like this.

Sorry for my english ;)

When I openeded this box I thought "I have game here for a lifetime!!". And that's probably true. You have a lot of game modes, variants and 30 characters. It is the second 10 in my collection. Very easy to understand but very, very deep when you realize what's behind the simple mechanics. Artwork is amazing and every character has a different thematic flavour, what makes you want to try every single one.

Love this game.  I have always liked the street fighter type games on video game consoles, this feels the same and has a lot of cool things that you can do.  

I really enjoy selecting the bases and styles and combining them together to form the attack.  There are some neat combos that can be pulled off.  There is also the meta game of trying to forsee what your opponent is going to do -Should I retreat a few spaces and do a ranged attack? Is my opponent going to unleash a monstrous attack if so maybe I should use Dash and run past him so he can't hit me-  These types of decisions are fun and with 30 very different characters it makes for some very fun diverse gameplay. Even if you figure out how to beat one character, it may take a totally different strategy to beat another.

While I love this game, it's been pretty polarizing to those I have introduced to it.  This sort of card-fighter feels great, with no random card draw and each beat being a combination of two cards.  There is lots of variety and anticipating your opponent.  Literally, the whole game is trying to outguess the other player.  And it's awesome.  Many of the fighters feel very unique in their capabilities and the box has A TON of other game modes and alternate cards and loads of stuff I haven't even tried yet.

The third and last Level 99 game I will buy. I will say Level 99 give you some bang for your buck with their games, but all of them suffer from the same issue: "Over-complication for the sake of being over complicated" Argent the Consortium had this problem and so does BattleCON. 

The systems in these games are solid on paper but playing a game let alone teaching them is arduous and many check out before I'm done explaining the rules, which I sometimes don't have a firm grip on to begin with.

I understand making a "fighting game" through a board game is neat, but to many triggers and "start of...end of" effects to even care for. I removed Millennium Blades from my wishlist for this same reason. I almost purchased Millenium Blades, but seeing as how I didn't like this, Argent: The Consortium & Pixel Tactics - which I ultimately sold all of them off - I doubt I will like any game Level 99 puts out. They have great artwork and components for their games, but all the games suffer from just too much added bloat and convulsion that is unnecessary.   Level 99, you guys need to look up the word streamlining pronto. More in a box doesn't mean a better game. Just play Street Fighter for the sake of your sanity. it pisses me off, cause I really wanted to like this game based on its theme and artwork

Hand management:Bluffing& Double think:Variable powers:

Battlecon is a slightly jazzed up Shazamm!, which was a very jazzed up En Garde. Its a good short little 2 player game and comes with a massive amount of characters to play ensuring some great replay value and things/combos to explore.

So very similar to Shazamm here with all the special powers and double-thinking going on, as well as more strategy than meets the eye at first glance. There is actually a thing or two not here from Shazamm and I kind of missed them, like the bridge (where fight takes place) shrinking every round which also served to keep the tension up.

Very well thought out actions and a clever little game, I gave this one the edge with my rating just due to the shear amount of characters as mentioned above. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
This game is incredible--in fact its one of my all time favorites.  With so many characters, play styles, arenas ect. BattleCON: Devastation has proved for my gaming group the go-to game.  In fact, we've got an awesome tournament going on right now!

With other character-based deck games (like Sentinels of the Multiverse) a lot of times you find that the deck plays you, rather than the other way around. In Devastation, because of the streamlined design, while the cards in each deck are comparably few, the combo potential and strategy with each feels endless.  

While the art may not be all that attractive to some, it does grow on you as you play.  The mechanics, balance and depth in this game will keep you captivated and excited to get this design masterpiece to the table as much as you possibly can.

I know you probably don't know me, but either convince your buddy to buy this game or bite the $70 bullet and go buy it yourself!

RATING: 10
Street Fighter the board game pretty much.

Each character has unique abilities or mechanics that make them feel unique and makes match up knowledge key sometimes.

The mind games are really similar to what you would have in a fighting game where the discard pile mechanics reduce the options available to a manageable amount.

A lot of good bluffing and getting reads on your opponent makes for great gameplay.

TO MUCH GAME….Kind of a weird comment, but its true, but is it a bad or good thing is up to you.  This game had massive replay value. if you want to play it that much.  There is way to many characters in the game, and they are all awesome, but you could have 8 characters in this game and you could play it for a long time with out losing interest.
when you play 2 players your playing with 15cards each(give or take a few cards) and a board. With only using about 4 percent of the game…Thats how much stuff you get, and future plays you can have.  To sum it up, you pay a lot for this box and you get a lot…but you could have a lot of fun with just a few characters.  But This game is awesome and i personally love having so many characters i can play in the future, just don't know if ill have time to get to play everything in this box.

Very solid game.  I like the mechanic of combining bases, which everyone has, with styles, which represent a character's unique training.

That said, there is a lot to Battlecon.  A lot.  Probably too much.  To do well at a game like this, you have to not only know your character, but your opponent's as well.  There are a load of characters, and more in each expansion.  Each of them can turn into another character, or has a cursed weapon, or can hire mercenaries to buff them, or summon insects, or control puppets, etc.  There's just too much here to get familiar with all the exceptions and edge cases.  If I were 15 or 16, this might be my favorite game, but as things stand, I'd rather play Yomi, which does what Battlecon is trying to do in what I think is a simpler, cleaner way.

theres so much in the box that its definitely got a lot of bang for the buck, even with the hefty price tag.  the game itself is basically a simultaneous action selection with a lot of possibilities and special powers for the many different characters.  ultimately i feel it's a bit too complicated for what it is

Best 2-player game I've played - zero random elements and a tight possibility space makes out-guessing and out-thinking the other players the focus of the game, which is what a fighting game is all about.

I hate it when people compare it to Yomi - Yomi isn't a fighting game, it's a (bad) card game with a fighting game theme. The two are nothing alike.

BattleCON achieves a near miracle in its pitch-perfect translation of fighting game mechanics and flavor from the digital world to the tabletop realm. It's basically a cardboard version of an SNK game, and the flow of the game balances the tactics and give-and-take of any fighting classic with incredible fidelity and feel.

I can't praise it enough, and as someone who admires fighting games but lacks the skill and reflexes to play them, it is absolutely perfectly up my alley.

Very good and quick 2p dueling card game. Best fighting game simulation I've seen.

Some downsides though... the game shines when you learn it together with one or more friends and together become better and get to delve deeper into the game. If the player skill levels are unbalanced it can feel kinda harsh and make the lesser experienced player not want to play again (just like with a video fighter game).
Also, despite Brad Talton's claims, it is not a easy game to get into. The timing/triggers really mess with a newbies head + it looks rather complex. I have scared away players just by showing them the cards... players I know that are very capable of easily handeling the game :(

Probably my all time favourite two-player game, there is such incredibly deep strategy in it and double-thinking tactics, not to mention a huge cast of characters and modules.

This is the definition of a perfect game.  Lots of game for the price, more depth than the grand canyon, more replay value than groundhog day, and super easy to teach.

Low table footprint, but lots of movement.  not to mention the theme shines super bright, with awesome characters, and some really fun mechanics.

The box is good for shipping, but not for storage, nothing a bit of cardboard, a bunch of mini ziplock bags, and 10 minutes of my time did not rectify.

BattleCON: Devastation of Indines is a standalone dueling card game designed for head-to-head and team play. Each player selects a character who uses a unique gameplay mechanism to give them an edge in combat. Take control of guitar-playing summoner, a pair of tag-teaming werewolves, a prodigal paladin, a genius artificer, and more! Each character's play style requires new strategies, but uses the same foundational tactics, making a new character easy to learn, but challenging to master.

Often compared to Yomi, but I feel they are different enough o own both.

TOO MUCH STUFF, Brad!

Jeez, is this box just crammed to the gills with BattleCON goodness. This literally fixes every issue that I had with the initial War Kickstarter edition game. SO MUCH gameplay in this box it's kind of hard to take it all in.

Me an my 3 other friends have been playing 3-character draft battles (both with single and double knock-out with each character) and this format is littered with intense game decisions right from the very first character selection.

We're hoping to introduce this to 2 other friends to get even more drafty goodness (would need to move this up to 24 characters though which makes for a much more indepth but also more difficult game to master amongst the group).

Really looking forward to both War Remastered and Armory to round out this entire gameplaying experience.

UPDATE: September, 2015. An all-time classic game. I really love how Lvl99 and Brad seem to be interconnected with the community and that development of new characters and mechanics and restructuring needed fixes for older characters is foremost on their minds. Just an awesome game experience and one that I'm jealous that I didn't think of first :)

A very good game. Tried 2 vs 1 and 1 on 1. Teri did not like the 1 on 1, I liked both. It is cool and quick, maybe you need to play best of 3 rounds to even out lucky draws. It has a lot of flavour and feels pretty cool though.

Type: 1-on-1 character against character fighting game with cards and board; tactical and quick, slightly asymmetrical. Does include coop mode for 1-5 players.

Best with: 2 (coop: 1-5)
Weight: Medium
Duration: 
Notes:
competitive card-based combat with light positional needs
gets better after a few games on each character as cards get understood

Similar games in my collection: This somewhat stands along as a mildly card-based 1-on-1 competitive direct damage game.

This game is a beast. A lot off content comes with it.
The game is pretty easy to play though and it is laid out brilliantly in the box for what you should tackle first.

I adore this game but my wife not so much so I have not played it as much as I want to.

For what I have played I rate it a perfect 10 because of the packaging, the rules and the tight game play. Time will tell if it retains this perfect score.

Heady but flavorful, this stand alone has tons of content, most of which you probably will never use. None-the-less, if you like thinky games, the content you will use is still staggering. The replay value of this game cannot be understated. Amazing design.

As far as I was expecting to love this game, it just didn't work for me. I didn't feel like being in a fast and furious combat and feeling each type of punch differently, but continiously reading and matching the cards without a clear idea what is my plan exactly and hoping that it works (Yes, I know that it is possible that it's me who is dumb :) )

Fighting games are my favorite genre of video games and Devastation really does play like a fighting game.  Takes a bit of prediction and a lot of strategy to try and outdo your opponent, but that's how fighting games are.  There's a lot of game in this package and you certainly get more than your money's worth.  But like any fighting game you need to have people who are dedicated and committed to learn every character to ultimately choose who they like best.

Once you get the storage problem figured out, it's got a lot of replayability. It's difficult to get into because there are so many things you have to consider. The cognitive load of just learning one character is large. Then you need to know at least a decent bit about your opponent's character. If you want to play multiple characters against multiple other characters, the cognitive load becomes enormous. It's a game that is either one of your main games, or one that you barely get into.

This is, far and away, my favorite head-to-head card game I've ever played.  It simulates quite exactly the experience of playing a fighting video game such as Street Fighter or Killer Instinct.  That said, there is also GREAT opportunity to mix things up and customize your game play with boss battles, deck revision, multiple tiers of fighters, etc.  Every time I play this, I'm left with that "let's play ONE more" feeling, which many games simply do not impart.

"Fantastic game, fantastic design, and would make any fighting game player ecstatic ... Everything is open information. You're allowed to see what moves are available to your opponent at any time, and vice versa.  ... there is zero randomness, and no dependencies on card draw. If you and your opponent make the exact same decisions in two separate games, you will have the exact same result."

This is exactly the kind of game that I was expecting and wanting it to be, and honestly my first 10.  The design is nice and tight, but still allows for so much variability and variety.  It is quick and engaging, yet heavy on the strategy with little luck.  I have always been a fan of duel card games, but have hated the amount of downtime or deck creation aspect some of them take.  Plus I never could get into a game that was a money pit, looking at you Magic.  This definitely is the game I want to play most often right now.  Hopefully I can just find enough people to play this game with, as I can see why it is not everyone's cup of tea.

Update - Changed the score to 9 since it is hard to find people who love it as much as I do.

This is the go-to answer to those looking for: 

a. a classic videogame-to-tabletop game porting ([i]pick whatever beat'em'up you like here: Street Fighter, Tekken & co[/i])

b. a wise, excellent, incredibly well-thought use of mere cards, without dice, and with a deterministic system ([i]you know how the decks are made, so it's a matter of "outwitting" the opponent[/i])

c. a game so vast that the term "best bang for the bucks" is almost silly; this game is nearly eternal

Fun. Quick. Smart. Thinky. Scalable. Full of each and any side game mode you could ever imagine (even a solo/coop crawler...). Go buy it NOW.

Wenn man BattleCon relativ kurz und knackig beschreiben möchte, könnte man dies mit den Worten "Strett Fighter als Brettspiel" sehr gut auf den Punkt bringen. Jeder Spieler übernimmt die Rolle eines Kämpfers und hier sei schon gesagt, dass die Auswahl an unterschiedlichen Recken einfach überwältigen ist. Typisch für den Verlag Lv99 Games, ist so unglaublich viel in der Box drin, dass man fast schon erschlagen wird. Hier gilt es den Ratschlag in der Anleitung zu befolgen und sich erst einmal mit den ersten 6 Kämpfern vertraut zu machen. Jeder Kämpfer hat eine eigene Spezialfähigkeit und spielt sich grundlegend anders. Während ein Kämpfer heftige Hiebe austeilt, ist ein anderer Meister der Verteidigung. Wieder ein anderer Kämpfer setzt auf Fernkampf oder auf die Manipulation des Schlachtfeldes. Das Spielgeschehn wird über Karten gesteuert und zwar legen die Spieler verdeckt je zwei Karten, die zusammen einen Angriff bilden. Jeder Angriff hat dann eine Initiative, eine Reichweite und einen Schadenswert und ggf noch einen besonderen Effekt. So fügen sich die Spieler gegenseitig Schaden zu, bis einer der Kämpfer K.O. geht. BattleCON ist ein Umfangsmonster und liefert Matieral für hunderte, spannende Duelle. Allerdings braucht man auch etwas Zeit, um sich in das Spiel einzuarbeiten und die dutzenden Kämpfer zu meistern. Das Material und das Artwork ist fantastisch!

The same mental skills are put to the test here (reading opponents and valuated decisions), but without the dexterity element present in real time games that pose a barrier of entry before being able to 'play' your opponent instead of the game. Highly recommended for those looking to play a single game repeatedly, as is single learning game or two may only yield frustration.

this game is probably an 8, but the product becomes a 9 with just how much they give you to play with. Other games would have 10 characters and then expansions, this one has 30, and a billion play modes and everything included to utilize them. Well done Level 99 games.

Really tight and tense gameplay. With good reason, this game is only limited to 2 players (the other modes aren't as good from my opinion), and this brings it a bit down for me.

Own the full set of the print and play demo copy with four characters. I intend to try it out for a while and then possibly put it on my wishlist depending on how much enjoyment I get out of the 2p battle fest.

Okay played. The match of red thief girl and eligor was close, 3-5 and then 3-0 hp. That was nice. The steps on the summary card and gameplay was fine. I can see why this is considered like street fighter. There isnt much strategy, its moreso mind games and thinking ahead like in a video game.

The step by step checks was rather annoying and took away from the gameplay though, but I guess it may get better with time and memorization. I still dislike it though and all the terminology (something that outs me off Mage Wars/Summoner Wars/Magic TG/Yugioh/etc, with things like Soak and Stun Guard.

I have no particularly strong complaints against the game otherwise, but I felt no huge thrill or fun or huge depth playing it. It was fine/solid I suppose.

BattleCON is a fun side scrolling fighting video game clone. With about 25 characters, in which only two are used a game, the replay ability of BattleCON stands out. I have yet seen all the characters in action, which, has me itching to play again. The flaw with BattleCON is found in its strength. I have not played BattleCON with the same person twice which means I am compelled to try a new character. Playing a new character every time is fun but I lose out on the fun really exploring the uniqueness of each character.

An amazing game. Has the potential to be a life-long obsession with so many character combinations. It is truly staggering to think about how many different match ups are possible.

Excellent fighting game that feels like as tense and deep as its video game inspirations of Guilty Gear or Street Fighter.

Every character plays differently and it's attractively depicted in anime-like style.

You have bruisers, speedsters, counter-attackers, tacticians, board controllers, mind games trapsters, powering behemoths, joke characters, poisoners, petrifiers, etc...

If you want a lighter version that plays faster and it may suit you better, try the same company's Exceed line.

Also, you do not need any expansion for Battlecon.  There's enough good stuff in War, Devastation and Fate, that whatever you get extra from the expansions is marginal value at best and some them I eventually ignored.

Battlecon is an excellent game, it really does have the feel of a 2D fighter and the basic concepts of how to play are fast to pick up. I feel that the game is extremely good value for money; you get stupid amounts of contents for £50. 30 characters, a number of bosses, the capacity for 1 on 1, 1 v 2, 2 v 2 and 3 v 1 a battle quest mode, arenas, the list goes on! 

On the face of it the gameplay is very simple, each turn or 'beat' includes all players choosing an attack pair (two cards) and then each character activating in priority order. That's it! Within that though are a multitude of different decisions and powers. This creates an interesting 1 on 1 duel where you're playing cards based on what you have and what you think your opponent will do. What they do can have a huge impact on your activation. If they get a higher priority then they can dodge out of your way, or just get a hit in first, stunning  you, leaving you unable to retaliate. If you can plan for this though you can make sure you have stun guard set up you still take the damage but at least you get to hit back! It is this sort of process that makes the game so interesting and fun. As well as this the different characters feel very different, each having completely different styles and special abilities.

My only complaint is that, especially when you don't know the characters well, the game can really slow down at times while the players choose their attack pair. I've had a 3 bout game last 90 minutes and I think on average it takes 45-60 minutes per 3 bout game. Now that I think of it, this kind of rhythm, a slow build up to a fast exchange of blows, reminds me of kendo (Japanese fencing), a martial art I used to practice. In kendo you spend a lot of time looking for openings and trying to out think your opponent, then suddenly the kendoka explode into an attack, settling back down afterwards; like a wave slowly building before crashing into the shore.

Update: This game is fucking awesome. I just got the Extended Edition extra stuff and I literally have no room left in the box when combined with War of the Indines. There is so much variety both in characters and variants, this game would literally never get old even when played repeatedly. I can't wait to explore this more. I just wish Jen enjoyed it more than she currently does.

The best fighting game simulation on the board game market today.

It blows Yomi out of the water by a big margin. The main difference in Battlecon is that the spacing, postionning and the movement matters in this game unlike in Yomi, which are the main aspects (known as Footsies) in a 2D fighter.

Every characters are so unique, the artwork is amazing. The contents are overwhelming in a good way with all the different extras and many game options. There's Zero randomness, as it's all about knowing the match-ups, spacing (footsies) and predicting your opponents moves.

If you like fighting games in general, then Battlecon is a no brainer for sure. Even for people not familiar with fighting games, they will have a blast. Go grab a copy quick !!

Then players simultaneously reveal,  and cards get resolved in speed order. The focus of the game is all about trying to line up combos, while reacting and predicting your opponent's moves. The game has a ton of character options, who are all of varying levels of difficulty to play.

Just like playing a fighting video game, you won't know how or when to do what and why with just one play, but rounds are fast, so you can learn, adapt, or switch to a different character. I love how in-depth it can get, as you get a move list for your opponent, so players who really know the game can get a sense of what the other characters are capable of. Unfortunately also, you can wind up playing mismatched characters, or the fact it can take a few plays to learn a character can mean that a significant number of sessions won't be super satisfying.

This game has a bunch of Multi-player modes in it, so it's not just 1 on 1, which I like a lot in theory, although I haven't tried them yet.

Boy, that's a whole lotta game in that box.  It is fun, quick, plays exactly like you'd expect.  I think I prefer Yomi ever so slightly, however.  BattleCON is just more "Marvel vs. Capcom," where Yomi is more "Street Fighter III."  I don't know how else to explain it.

Didn't like the dungeon mode, it's boring. The normal 1v1 and 2v2 are pretty good though, especially the location cards. But this is not easy to play with newcomers, it takes some time to learn about your character, and the first game can fall flat because of that. Have not tried the boss mode.

Not as super-high on this as I used to be, but it's still a tremendously clever game of "I know you know I know" with great core mechanics and dizzying variety. Some balance problems and s awkward rule ambiguities are an ocassional bug bears, but it's still an awesome game if you have an equally committed sparring partner to play with.

Wow, I'm impressed. I'm a HUGE beat'em up videogame fan, since the first Street Fighter came out in 1990, so a game like this one is a hit alone for me. But really I wasn't expecting something like this.
The game may appear expensive, but the box is SO rich that in the end, all considered, it is cheap. I say that because not only we have here a complete fighting game consisting of 30 (!) characters, each unique and deep to master, granting alone hundreds of hours of play... but we also have A TON of game modes, options, variants and much, much more. Now I understand the 'Don't panic!' sheet in the box! :)
Kudos to the designers, they did a REALLY good job.

I just played some matches right now but I have to play a lot to learn the game; 30 characters are so many! So I'll rate the game when I'll be able to figure out the magnitude of the whole.

The artwork is good, while the cards' layout is not outstanding, quite good. Functional for sure.

A final, special mention to the BattleQUEST Dungeon mode, a 20 pages booklet consisting of 6 dungeon-scenarios (some playable with a Master!) which transform the game into a sort of dungeoncrawl/puzzle game: really a great and welcomed, shining little feature.

EDIT: for now, after some other matches, I rate it a 9. This game is fantastic.

This doesn't take into account every character, or even every variant/mode, because frankly that's a prohibitively time consuming bar to clear.

So based purely off of the elegance of the system, the depth of the strategy, the absurd value for money (there's something like 3 or 4 expansions worth of content that are essentially free) and the fact that this is a game that clearly rewards repeat plays without ever needing to buy anything else, this is a 10.

Clean and brisk-playing duel game. Enjoyed the asymmetrical way the different characters play out, and the cycling of played cards. It's evident that the real tactics don't kick in until you're familiar enough with your own cards to track your opponent's capability. I'm not sure I'll find someone to play this with enough to reach that level. So while it promises tremendous variability and replayability, I have my doubts I would ever tap into that richness.

The optimal move may not be the one that will inflict the most damage, but the one that your opponent will least anticipate. You must tailor your decisions not only to what you think your opponent will play, but also to what your opponent will think you will play.

It's horrible that I don't get the pleasure of playing this on a regular basis. This is the game in my collection for which I would join a weekly group. I know there are one-sided matchups, but I'm not one to dwell on game balance. If one player makes short work of another, that just leaves time for another game, new characters, or hey, lets try out one of the special stage rules!

To be clear, it's the breadth of fighting styles that makes it good, many of which are clever, or so over the top that BattleCON fighters out-mode the oft larger-than-life arcade fighter genre that BattleCON successfully emulates.

This game offers no false pretense as to what it is trying to be: a card-driven fighting game. The genius in the design is giving each character a unique set of cards (styles) and combining these with a common card pool (bases) that both duelists have access to to augment their styles. You know what your opponent has, you just do not know of their play timings. The result? A streamlined game of rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock with an emergent metagame each time you play. What this game sets out to do, somehow distilling the innumerable nuts and bolts of the fighting game experience into cardstock form, it does phenomenally well. 

(+) Despite what seems to be an intimidating rulebook, the game is actually very easy to grasp and start playing.
(+) A breadth of characters are offered to you at your fingertips, a balance between accessible and technical, so it can appeal to all skill levels.
(+) Replay-ability value is near unparalleled for what you pay, compared to typical CCGs/LCGs. Between character mastery, matchup mastery, and the dungeon mode, you have innumerable hours of gameplay...provided you play it.

(-) Requires a competent opponent to enjoy.* A duel is more tense when both players can take full advantage of the part-hidden/part-known information to great effect, i.e. the bluffing and prediction mind-games commence.
(-) High learning curve. Combined with point #1, this results in somewhat of a barrier to entry for new players. The multitude of decisions can lead to some high AP until players get comfortable in the driver's seat of their characters.
(-) Poor component functionality. The insert is absolutely terrible at holding everything after punching, and the cards are not high quality. Penny sleeves suggested (no need to be concerned of heavy sleeve durability, as you do not shuffle the cards).
 

* There is a nice solo variant in the files section that is a true labor of love to the game, and functions well. Not as good as an opponent of course, but it is better than nothing if you are just practicing characters.

22-01-2014. Rated after 2 plays. 2p 2D fighting game in which 2 players with different fighters try to outwit each other. Just like Mortal Kombat, you move forwards and backwards and try to attack your opponent. The game comes packed with 30 different fighters, each with unique styles and tokens. 

You attack by playing two cards, a style and a base card that together determine how fast and powerful your attack is and in addition how far you can move. Part of the fun is trying to outguess your opponent.

Excellent game.

So far I really like the game, but it definitely makes you think.  There are so many potential combination of what you could play combined with what your opponent might lay down.  Trying to figure out what the best move is takes a lot of thought and knowledge.  

Our initial games were really ugly while we were learning the characters and what everyone could do.  The more you play the better the game gets though.  This is a problem though, since I would never bring this out to a light gamer.  I think it would overwhelm them.

It's hard not to compare BattleCON to Yomi. Even though they're quite different mechanically, they recreate the same experience. But with all its polish, Yomi feels more like Street Fighter, while BattleCON is like Guilty Gear, a weird mashup that's a bit rougher around the edges but easier to get into. Both are good designs. For me, Yomi is more fun with its heavier emphasis on combos and hand management, but others will disagree. To wit, there's no luck in BattleCON--although I think that simultaneous action selection often [i]feels[/i] like luck, so there's not much practical difference. 

I have no idea how well balanced everything is because the sheer volume of content is staggering. I'm less fond of Level 99's "more is better" philosophy than fans are; I would prefer to have more attention paid to fewer options. More choice is not always a good thing; it means you'll spend a lot more time learning the game than playing it at a high level.

I love Level 99 games. There's something about them that makes me want to play them again and again. Still, BattleCon is not my favorite series. I prefer Exceed (from the same company) and Yomi (Sirlin), because the games are a little more dynamic than BattleCon. I feel that as the series develops, the complexity added keeps freezing the pace of a game already leaning towards AP - which is not a good thing for a fighting sim (but I have high hopes for "Trials"). Still, a fantastic game which, like most Level 99 games, does suffer from average to mediocre balance between characters.

Switched from the now discontinued PnP edition to the retail box. This box is full, heavy and pretty much impossible to close again once you've taken out its contents for the first time. So remove the insert as well and then you might be able to cram the actual game components back in the box. If you're organized.

Pretty straightforward to learn (at least for the basics), and then you can integrate finishers, special actions, arenas, tag team, Strikers (expansion), Armory (expansion), EX and Almighty fighters (Light and Shadow expansion), as well as move forward in the flights for more complex characters.

Nice mechanic with perfect info in mind, where the only unknown is what option your adversary will choose. Really love this one.

Easily one of my top 3 favorite games.  There is so much content in the game, that I can never expect to use it all.  I'll probably never use the arensa, promo characters, or alternate bases.  There's enough core content to last a long time.  Add in the solo, co-op, and one vs many boss modes, and it brings the game to perfection.

RATING: 10
Why it's a 10:

Amazing feel:  I love the diversity of characters, powers, and strategies in this game.  There is a difference between characters in both their special powers and their move sets.  BattleCON feels very much like a fighting game.

Interesting Decisions:  Every beat is a tough decision.  You know the things you would like to do, and you know what your opponent would like to do.  Very rarely is a move a complete surprise.  Moves are selected by an interesting negotiation between players on who will get to make their most optimal move.  This negotiation is not overt: it is a subtle sum of past moves, board position, and previous game meta, coupled with an understanding of your opponent's capabilities.  The psychology that goes into each move is where this game shines. 

Zero sum/quick payoff: Often, it can be difficult to measure how small interactions over the course of the game can result in an advantage for one of the players.  This is because a lot of decisions in games are beneficial in context of the whole remainder of the game.  If I take a single pig in Agricola so my opponent can't get a breeding pair, it is difficult to measure how much food production and points I cost them  BattleCON doesn't have this ambiguity.  If one player's move is good, the other player will suffer an immediate and proportional change in game position.

Does not suffer from the Rich get Richer cycle (Usually): I think it is very important for board games to reward good play, otherwise they are less of a game and more of an exercise in storytelling.  But, a lot of games tend to reward good play by not only increasing one's proximity to a winning score, but also rewarding that player with more scoring potential.  This is an ironic twist where the better decision maker not only gets more efficiency from their moves, they also get game mechanisms which gives them better moves to choose from. BattleCON doesn't generally reward good play with more powerful characters.  Instead, good play lowers the life of your opponent relative to your own or it puts you in a good place to do so on the following turn.  There is some added strength in having a lot more life than an opponent (in that you can take riskier moves with a bigger payoff) but even this is mitigated by a mechanism that becomes active for any player who gets close to losing.  There are characters that bend this rule as their unique features increase or decrease their power over time, but those are rare exceptions (and it is a little more nuanced than that anyway)

RATING: 9
If you enjoy playing arcade or console fighting games (or have fond memories of such), you simply need to get your hands on a copy of BattleCON. Just like any fighter worth its weight, the system here rewards practice and mastery with the characters. This is the type of game that opens up the more you play it, and the wide cast of characters all bring something interesting to the table -- both mechanically and thematically. While a quick glance might suggest this game is of the Ameritrash variety, it certainly has the bite of a solid Euro in terms of play optimization. If there is one downside to this game, it would be that it is the bane of AP-prone players, especially when learning a new character. Regardless, this may be the pinnacle of fighting games and is a must if you're in the market for one. 

As a side note, I should quickly touch on Yomi, as the two often get compared because of their similar theme. Stated simply, these games play vveerryy differently. Yomi is a fine game in its own right and I still happily play it. It's also the easier game to get into it if you're looking for a nice entry point.

A great fighting game in analog form. It's open to beginners in that most of the information you need is right in front of you, but also rewards experienced players as they know what attacks and strategies to expect from characters they've played as.

Balance is good, though of course some characters have poor matchups. There are three main balance offenders as far as I can tell, for whom it is frequently not clear how you would even go about formulating a counter-strategy. Even they are weak to particular opponents, though, and among friends it is enough to agree not to play them under threat of counterpicking. There are few (< 5 I can think of) pairings outside those characters where the situation feels truly hopeless for one player. With 30 characters in the game (plus 28 in War and Fate), I claim this is Good Enough.

Expect a first game to take 1 hour including explanation; 2 for players prone to analysis paralysis. The game time can go down to 30-60 minutes for players capable of learning what information can be ignored. (Reddit tells me 20 minutes is reasonable; I don't quite believe that unless they're all playing matches of 7-8 beats or less.) In my experience third order logic is usually not necessary, as it closes the loop to your original attack pair.

2v1 and 3v1 are ~~better balanced than we expected; it never felt like either side is outclassed.~~ primarily determined by character selection once players pass a relatively low skill threshold. 2v2 is ~~also good~~ a little better, though it should be agreed upon ahead of time how explicit you can be when planning your turn. Our house rules agreement is that anything you say must be said to the whole table, and you may not indicate your play non-verbally to your partner. Really, though, if you're picking up BattleCON for the long haul you should expect to invest your efforts in 1v1 play.

Overall this game has replaced most 1v1 games I have in my collection. In particular it has more variety and less luck than Summoner Wars, and requires less investment than Netrunner. (He said, immediately going in on the War Remastered Kickstarter with all the bells and whistles.) The only problem is finding local opponents who enjoy the game as much.

RATING: 3
I was so profoundly disappointed by this game. It sounds just so cool, the idea of mixing moves with attacks to simulate a fighting video game, so full of content, tons of characters that all play different, different play modes, it sounded awesome...
It's so over complicated. SO over-complicated.
It's not even about it being hard to learn or anything, just every action you take is painfully drawn out if you intend to actually strategize. For a game meant to simulate a fighter, one of the fastest paced of games, turns are blindingly slow and a combat feels like it takes an age.
The dearth of game modes and characters is offset by the fact many of them are so inferior as to be unplayable... the degree to which some characters are better than others is just a joke.  This game broke my heart, I'd recommend against.

Expansion / Stand Alone.  30 more characters, arenas & lots of optional rules.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
The amount of variety in the different characters is huge. The production is also excellent. Thick cardboard standees, life-counter dials, card holders to keep things separated, a nice glossy board, tons of tokens for the different characters.

Then there's the gameplay. The first problem is the lack of any randomness. This means that every turn you have to go through all of the options of what your opponent could possibly play before choosing your own cards. This can take several minutes and really slows down the game.

I actually like looking at my hand of cards and trying to make my best possible move. That part is quick and fun. But if you don't take the time to analyze your opponent's options then they can usually just cancel out your best move in some way.

It also seems like there can be some one-sided matchups. This, along with a number of fighters that have been updated for balance and possibly banned, makes it seem like not enough development has taken place.

I wanted to like it, but I just can't get into a game that is this slow and AP-prone.

Update: This company has now made a far better game called Exceed, which is based on Battlecon. It actually addresses most of the problems I pointed out here: there is now a good amount of randomness, AP is no longer as much of an issue (mainly because of the randomness), and the turns have been greatly streamlined. The cardplay has actually been improved over Battlecon because you now have an element of managing your cards as they have multiple uses in Exceed. Exceed really feels like the game they originally wanted to make, but they didn't quite know how to do it back then so it just needed a few years of refinement.

Kickstarter edition. Backed at the Battle Pack tier, so includes base game, Extended edition, promotional characters and stretch goals. 

Due to all the additional pieces, the insert has been removed and each character has been put into it's own tuckbox made by myself, using the files available here on BGG. The tuckboxes are not perfect (most do not close perfectly and they are printed in black and white so the picture that would be on each is basically entirely faded) but they all do the job of containing the cards, tokens and character stands needed for each character as well as the optional bosses. 

Even with the tuckbox organization, not all pieces of the game actually fit in the box and some of the extra parts will come separately in an unmarked white cardboard box. This includes the promo player characters, armory cards, tokens for the arena, and the rebalanced War of Indines cards and Pixel art character stands.

RATING: 10
This has become my favorite game of all time, of any genre, on any platform.

BattleCON is a fighting game turned tactical tabletop game with near-perfect information that gives you all the time you need to weigh your options and make your moves, yet somehow still captures the invigorating rush of going head-to-head with an opponent in real time.

It's straightforward to learn: most introductory games take 30-40 minutes, in my experience.

It's easy to play: once you know the basic rules, you can pick up any character, read their cards, and start playing that character.

It has tremendous diversity: a cast of dozens of characters, yet you're not required to memorize any of them to know what you're up against, since each comes with a reference card to be given to their opponent.

It has astonishing depth: the number of possible matchups, plus variants that can modify the nature of the battle, mean that no game is truly predictable.

Although designed for two players, it has variants and boss modes which enable practically any number of players, from 2v1 to 4v4 to 1- to 4-player cooperative modes in which the player(s) adventure through dungeons and face challenging bosses. And the lore and flavor of the world are incredible!

While this type of game will not appeal to everyone (unlike Argent: The Consortium, it bears no resemblance to Euro-style games), those who like it at all tend to love it. Download the free Print-and-Play demo and give it a whirl!

BattleCON is one of the best games I've ever played. A fighting game in a box; it's quick and it's addictive. I know that if this game had come out in my younger years I would have played this non-stop. While I may not have as much free time now, it's still a fantastic pick up and play game. The amount of content in the box is fantastic!

I'd just like to give a shout out to Level 99 Games. Excellent customer service and keep up the good work!

Update: Dropped the rating from a 9 to an 8. It's really AP inducing, so disregard my comment about quick.

I wonder if the layout of the cards could be better. Maybe with some large numbers so that you don't need to memorise what order everything needs to be in.

Willing to try again with experienced players, but the early games didn't leave me much desire to push on with it. Perhaps some of the more complicated characters would make for an interesting game, but the set we learned with didn't seem to allow much possibility for interesting decisions or creative play. The concept of an arcade-style fighting game as a board game seems cool, though.

This is a brilliantly ballanced and entertaining card battle game. The sheer amount of content, options, and replayability is overwhelming. The only reason I haven't rated this a 10/10 is because of the lack of effective storage options offered natively for all the stuff in the game. The Extended Edition is a must if you have War and want to integrate it into Devastation.

BattleCON: Devestation of the Indines is extremely simple mechanically, but it can still be tough to learn because there are so many unique fighters and each one has their own little mini-game they play to enhance their fighting stats. Seriously, everytime you pull a new fighter out of the box it almost feels like you are learning to play for the first time.

That's not a complaint, just something you should be aware of before you take the leap.

Now that we got that out of the way, holy crap is there an embarrassment of riches in this box. A ridiculous amount of characters, cards for tag-team variants, variable fighting arenas, cards for 3 on 1s, cards for super powered battles, equipment cards for boosting and customizing fighters...even a ridiculous "double dragon" style side scrolling adventure game complete with Boss fights, if you are so inclined. Seriously, this is one of the most ambitious designs I have ever seen.

Between this and Argent the Consortium, Level 99 delivers the best bang for your buck in the industry.

This game delivers on so many levels.  First off, content: there are SO MANY character, game modes, variants, modules, etc, that there will probably never be any need to expand this game (though, undoubtedly, I will, given there are expansions/full games that do just that).
Second, it is a luckless game that manages to get around the problem of repetition (see most abstract strategies like chess etc) by adding so much starting variability.  Sure, no two games of chess may be alike.  But, to me, they feel like the same game.  With BC: DoI, once you've *mastered* a character's strategy and tactics, all you need to mix things back up again is a new opponent character.  And, with so many to pick from, you're unlikely to have to time to master every combination.
The theme is great.  Good components. Storage for the game is a bit of a problem, with so so so many cards, tokens, etc.  But that's not a bad thing.  The storage solutions the game comes with (sleeves to hold each character's unique card-set) is fine.  But you'd probably want to customize your own - especially if you,re like me and sleeve all the cards to prevent damage.
As there is no luck in the game, some people might find it frustratingly punishing when they play for the first time.  But, since the base mechanics of the game are very logical, once they get the rhythm of the beat (the rounds are called beats - how appropriate), it won't be hard to play quick enough that that frustration will disappear quickly.

It's a 2-D fighting game in a box. It has 30 characters that are all unique. It has arenas, boss fights, a fully realized dungeon-crawling side scroller mode, and more. It can be learned in ten minutes, but has incredible strategic depth. The game plays 1-5 players, but since the game board is so simple, I had eight people play four separate 1 vs 1 duels and had a tournament. The more you put into, the more it gives back. The replay value is staggering. It is a fully realized world and game in a box. If this sounds even remotely like something that interests you, do yourself a favor and buy this game now.

I found this one pretty good. The production is quite nice and the features of the game feel pretty original. I like the odd bidding bits and auctions. I like the theme quite a bit as well. So it definitely works. The only things that keeps me back is the price. If I find it for a good price, I may pick it up.

Buen juego de subastas y organizacion de losetas (tipo  carcassone pero de forma individual) conectando ciudades con vias de tren. Tienes que gestionar las conexiones entre ciudades, la salubridad, polución y control de residuos de las mismas, para conseguir puntos de victoria, lo de la basura y reciclarla es un puntazo jejeje, mejor con 4 o 5, aunque hay reglas especiales para 3 e incluso no oficiales para 2, pero a falta de probarlo, la parte de subastas perderá muchísimo

It is a fairly good economic game combining tile placement and bidding (actions and bonuses) with az enviromental theme: having to power up cities, connecting them with railroads and of course taking out the garbage, or being penalized heavily. The mechanics work well, but the design is below average, doesn't really catch that save the world from trash feeling.

I think it's suchy's best game. Or at least the one I enjoyed most among other nice games like shipyard, league of six + expansion, last will. It has great graphics, simple system and a good economic balance. Only thing I did not very much enjoy was the tile placement which causes spatial limitations, of which I am a hater. But there are the technologies of bridges and locomotives for that.

The money auction is interesting, but the science auction fell flat for me.  During the money auction players are bidding for city and tech tiles.  Players get to actually do stuff with most of these tiles, whereas in the science auction players are basically bidding in order to not lose points.

mmmmm.....the mechanics and quality componants of this game mean that on paper I should really like this one, however after one play I have to say I'm left cold by the experience and with some reservations about the game structure;

1/ If you stumble in the early moves and don't set up an efficiently firing cash and science engine, you will always play second fiddle to those who nail this aspect of the game. The tiles are not all even so some people won't score the good tiles.

2/ This opens the door to a run away leader who will not be caught.

3/ The points gulf for removing rubbish compared to not removing it is unassailable. If you are closed out of the sale of recycling plants you will lose.

I can't see multiple paths to victory, just one with three items to focus on. I might be persuaded to play this again but only if there was nothing else on the table and I wouldn't think about buying it.

Decent game that I think we stretched out, especially by small bid increments on the catastrophes.  I was very surprised at my finish in the game (3rd out of 5) after feeling like I was clearly trailing the entire time.  This game feels a bit like Peloponnes in that you are auctioning to get tiles that build your society and doing your best to deal with terrible events.  This game is a bit more serious though and I'm not sure that it works as well.

2010. 3-5p. 120 min. Auctions/bidding, tile-laying, and engine building. The game revolves around tile auctions (then placement), and it's largely an efficiency game in which you must balance income (2 currencies... money & science as well as VPs) with waste/trash build-up, making this game feel like Antiquity-lite for some folks.

Get a developer, will you Vladimír? This is not as bad as Shipyard, but it's still just a mishmash of every idea that seems to have come into the designer's head. There is no central idea here, no theme, just an ugly conglomeration of unnecessarily obtuse auctions and tactics. It plays like a rough draft of a game, one that never had its prose reviewed or edited for focus, one where nobody ever said "OK, what are you actually trying to say here?". There is an old saying about writing, that at some point you need to go back and cross out two out of every three adjectives you use. This would be good advice for all CGE games, but Suchý's games in particular. He could afford to lose a number of nouns also, as well as have some idea of what kind of story he's trying to tell.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Nothing really terrible about this game, but nothing great either.  Overall, it's an auction-fest, with auction after auction after auction.  You endlessly bid on tiles, make some minor choices on where to put them, all in an attempt to build a money and point engine.  I don't mind auctions, but I really wish there was something else here, especially if I'm going to be doing it for two hours.

There is the tile play aspect of the game, but the tile-laying is surprisingly meaningless in most cases.  There are some very minor decisions to make about where to place tiles, but overall the tile placement is rather inconsequential given how big a part of the game it seems to want to be.

Overall, I just didn't feel like this design had enough oomph to it to warrant a 2 hour game.  It felt like a half hour game that for some reason was stretched into a long game, and there are a heck of a lot of other games I'd rather play given a two-hour time slot.

I postponed buying this game for a long time due to some negative reviews, but I finally tried it - and after that I had to buy it. I think it was a pleasant surprise when I played it with 5 players, and it's been equally great when I tried it with 4 players; I do suspect it won't work well with less than 4 players, though.

I like the many decisions you have to think about each turn and I like that the game is broken into four small parts: the auction for the tiles you want, when to drop out to get a good technology, how much science you want to spend to avoid garbage and then finally how you place your purchased tiles and in which city (if there are more possibilities) the worker is put in. This is very important as moving the workers in later turns are very hard - even if you have a train you can only move a single worker, so you better choose wisely!

I think these two mechanics, auction and tile placement, meshes together wonderfully! Sure, the actual tile placement part feels a little solitaire (not that I personally mind), but the auctions make up for this. All in all I really like 20th Century and think it's one of the better auction games out there!

My recommended number of players: 4, 5
Best with: 4, 5

Rated 8 after one play. I really enjoyed this. My comment was, "It's like Glen More, but fun and with a theme." Basically, the game is auctions, tile laying, and managing "good resources" (money/science) and "bad" resources (garbage.)

After one turn, the game flow is very clear and flows smoothly. The only catch is the end game scoring. There's a "double scoring" extra round at the end, and the impact of your choices can be a bit of a surprise.

Very positive first try and I'd play this again in a heartbeat.

A couple of more plays and this slides ever so slightly to a 7. I'll happily play this again. I just don't have that "game envy" that I do with games that are slightly better.

Not sure what took me so long to play this. It sat on my shelf for what, 7 years unplayed? Perhaps it was that there's not much of a board. Just spaces to put tiles that are up for the land auction, and a grid for bidding on the disaster auction, and a score track. This is a hybrid game of auction and tile placement (personal area, like Alhambra). There are two different auctions, and both are really tight, but at the same time it's quite difficult to figure out what things are actually worth, particularly the first (for land tiles). Values changed radically between our first and second games (which we played back to back as everyone wanted to give it an immediate 'nother go). Like Ra, values of tiles auctioned can vary player to player. Rules overall are fairly low complexity, but there are a few corner cases around what "connected" means and the differences between "connected" for the purposes of moving trash to recycling plants versus moving citizens. Given the progression of land/tech tiles that come out, you really need to play at least twice before you've actually played. Oh, and course I play with open coins/science. Those who enjoy playing memory will play with hidden information, as written in the rules.

RATING: 6
20th Century has been a very vague blip on my radar ever since it came out; and it wasn't until I played Shipyard (by the same author) that I decided to see if I could get it played sometime. Like Shipyard 20th Century is a bit of a puzzle game, but instead of maximising a number of point contracts for various ship types, you are now managing a small country comprised of cities and some factories connected by railroads. The cities produce money and science points, but also garbage. The less garbage there is in your country, the more points it's worth. There are of course some extra ways to score points, but those appear to be more about finetuning than they are about the bulk of what you can obtain. The competition in 20th Century is handled by various auctions: city and technology tiles are put up for sale with the highest bidder paying to the bank and preparing to incorporate what he bought into his growing 'country'. Then there is an 'auction' of sorts which has players dealing with catastrophes, which is a nice way of saying that at most nothing happens to the players, while in the extreme case, many bonus points disappear in addition to getting an extra load of garbage to deal with. After six rounds the game ends and whoever scored the most points, wins.

At the beginning I was warned that 20th Century might harbour a bit of a runaway leader problem, but that should actually be a staybehind loser problem. Players who got a lot of tiles also got a lot of resources which allowed them to bid competitively, overruling the less fortunate players. The game offers few mechanisms to the less fortunate ones to get back into the action. I am inclined to both agree and disagree with the existence of the aforementioned issue: There are indeed little to no mechanisms to get back to a competitive position; at the same time all players must [i]really[/i] bid to maximum capacity and then some in order to force the more affluent opponents to spend what they earn. Otherwise they get their wares too cheap. Still, that I won my first game with the smallest country indicates that size really isn't everything: it's in being efficient with what you obtain and stretching the ecological niche you can thus create to its limits.

It is in fact the long-term viability of 20th Century that has me worried most at this point. There aren't many ways in which to specialise oneself, and that would mean that the games would get a samey feel. So while I can definitely say I wouldn't say no to a few more games, I'm not sure I would want to own this game; certainly not at full price.

Players are micro-managing the expansion and environmental impact of their "country".  Players during the turn participate in the auction of land tiles, which come with a citizen (disk) and garbage (cube).  Auctions are around the table fashion for cash, but with the option to "drop out" of all other auctions this turn to get an early claim in for a technology tile on offer (a special power).  Players then bid science points to avoid the worst effects of the turn's environmental disaster, in Amun-Re style.  Finally, players get to play with their region and technology, nudging citizens around from city to city by train, moving garbage, building bridges and so on.  Cities occupied by citizens do stuff, such as produce cash, science, victory points as well as recycle adjacent garbage.  Repeat five times, scoring bonus points after turns 2 and 4.  Final scoring encompasses pretty much everything you've achieved, with emphasis on how well you've managed your garbage and environment tracks.  Mechanically, quite a simple game, but lots of little things to consider as you manage your lands to maximise your end of game points.  Feels a bit dry from the outside looking in, but certainly engrossing to play.  Another very solid game from Vladimir Suchy (following on from League of Six and Shipyard).

The game is about you expending your city. The land tiles always contain citizen living in the city and they produce thrash. Your job is to control this trash with recycling centre and keeping the environment clean. You get minus points for not disposing the garbage entirely.

There's a carcassonne like style where you buy land tiles and try to connect with your existing tiles. You're trying to connect it in the most efficient manner so that you can control the garbage.

The core of the game is about bidding (you do this 3 times). First bid to get land tile, 2nd bid to get tech tile, and last bid to avoid catastrophe. 

Nothing new or interesting to me. It was an okay experience/game. A lot of management to do in this game but it left me uninterested.

A mildly interesting resource optimization game with a significant auction element.  I found the game somewhat dry, tending more toward an accounting exercise than a game.  Game feels claustrophobic during play due to the large numbers of icons, tokens and markers crowded into the Carcassonne-sized tiles.  Production quality of the game is good, though I find the color scheme unattractive.  

Some technologies, particularly the passenger rail system, seem to need fixes -- it feels absurd that the rail system can move only a single population token from one city to an adjacent city.  What the player wants and expects from his trains is to freely move population tokens anywhere in his country.  Awkward, non-intuitive rules regarding rail movement for population tokens and waste were a constant source of confusion, and failure to print a turn sequence on the player cards was a mistake.  

Summary: this game just didn't grab me.  It seemed to lack that certain something that makes one want to play again.  Perhaps weak theme integration is to blame.  Why do newly purchased land tiles come with stacks of garbage?  Why does your second land tile acquired in a round come with twice as much?  Why don't the cites produce any waste during the course of play?  The allocation of garbage cubes seems very arbitrary and unrealistic.  Further, though the box art and advertising copy suggest that this is a game of nation development over time, it's really just about the mechanics of waste disposal.

Caveat to reader: I generally don't like auction games.  If you do, you might consider adding one point to my rating.

This game is by Czech Games Edition's Vladimír Suchý, successful designer of titles like Last Will and Shipyard. It features empire building aspects combined with resource management, tile placement, and even auctions. It's been called everything from SimCity to Power Grid meets Carcassonne on steroids, as players must use commerce and science to urbanize their country. But equally important to building an economy is the need for scientific research and ensuring environmental quality by avoiding ecological disasters such as those which can result from excessive garbage or pollution. 20th Century is a solid bidding and building game that deserves more attention than it has received until now.

See my review: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/837948

Comments: Bidding game with simple resource management and empire building aspects, Carcassonne on steroids (tile placement combined with auction mechanisms & resource management), different paths to victory, looks complex but flows smoothly, has some auctions, interaction but not at all confrontational.  A balancing game between resources, disasters and garbage (currencies are gold & science). Negative comments suggest it has considerable bookkeeping/number-crunching, and just a bit dull/ordinary.  Good with 3 or 4, best with 5.

1 play - 5. By now i've realized i don't like auction games because they are far too difficult. You not only have to value things, but figure out what each opponent values them at.

This game is alright, but far, far too punishing. It wasn't fun. The mechanics and such are pretty cool, one of the best auction games i've played.

RATING: 5
It's a medium-light bidding game that has some interesting decisions with a spatial element in how you place tiles you buy and therefore build your city. You could do worse for tile-laying, auction game, but there was nothing to make this one stand out in terms of clever plays or tension. Probably the type of game that, if I bought, would not get played even though nobody would say they didn't like it.

RATING: 4
This game played without incident, but it had no spark that made me want to try it again.  It has the standard assortment of Euro mechanisms, with auctions to provide auto-balance, and 5 turns that are all more or less the same.

If I want to play a game with this general theme, I greatly prefer Industrial Waste.

20th Century is primarily an efficiency engine game, fueled by a series of interlocking auctions.

If there is one thing to hold against the game it's that it tries to do too much at once and loses a lot of focus as a consequence. The central idea of building an economy while keeping pollution in check gets watered down by lots of micromanagement. The entire tile placement portion in particular is largely inconsequential, and the disaster auction is merely annoying since there are usually precious little trade-offs to be considered. Everybody simply bids as much as possible for the good options, gradually relegating the non-performers to the bad spaces.

There are a couple of different ways to acquire your victory points but most of it feels a bit like pseudo-differentiation since you need both money and research to get off the ground so it isn't until shortly before the end of the game that paths really begin to diverge much. Actually, that kind of uniformity seems to be a repeating pattern: Both the landscape tiles and the research projects aren't particularly noteworthy, either. It's extremely rare that one player is willing to pay a notable premium for a tile because it just fits his strategy so much better.

In the end, 20th Century certainly isn't a bad game. It's just that everything it does has already been done elsewhere, and better, even if not in exactly this combination.

Fun city building game with a nice twist: you have to get rid of garbage that multiplies as your city grows. Garbage ultimately doesn't seem that big a deal since there is a last half-turn to get rid of them, but I suspect the designer meant for us to expand the cities more aggressively. Looking forward to more plays.

RATING: 6
A game of auctions and tile placement, with a mix of resource management thrown in for good measure.  

20th Century is a slightly more than average design, if a little overwrought, that attempts to blend many mechanisms and almost succeeds.  There are interesting ideas here - just feels like it needed more time in the cooker. 

Production quality is good, and the auction to avoid ecological disaster is delicious fun (best tension of the game).

Auction with 2 different currencies, tile laying, and a penalty mechanic for garbage, which can be recycled.  I found this to be very average.  Not original, streamlined, or elegant, and thin theme.  Still, the gameplay works and there is some tension to the auctions.

A fairly average euro themed around building a country and managing pollution. Lots of auctions but otherwise no direct interaction. You get VP for all kinds of stuff. A very typical euro and one that I likely won't play again since this is the same euroy stuff I avoid these days. Pretty boring. That said the system is very smooth and if you like the typical euro fair you will likely enjoy this one.

Played 5+ There are hard decisions to be made without locking your head up with the analises. This and Navegador were my favourites from Essen 10. *UPDATE* 5 plays and I am still enjoying 20th Century. It is a nicely weighted Euro for its 2 hour play time. Seems to play equally well with 3,4 or 5. There is no meaningful interaction, you can't hurt anouther player, it is you v's the game system. I have never seen this as a bad thing but others might.

Un juego bastante solido de Vladimir Suchy, el del shipyard.

En el juego tratamos de construir un país libre de basura y polución y que sea fuerte en desarrollo económico, científico y en sanidad.

El juego es un batiburrillo de mecánicas que parecen estar bien implementadas, hay distintos tipos de subastas, compras y colocación de Tiles para ir construyendo nuestro país. Un juego bastante correcto y entretenido, mas corto de lo que pone en la caja y con unos componentes y un diseño muy conseguido.

El desarrollo y la mecánica es muy táctica, ya que nos planificamos turno a turno dependiendo de los Tiles que vayan saliendo y lo que vayamos necesitando en cada momento. Hay terrenos, pero también hay industrias y tecnologías que se pueden adquirir para desarrollar nuestro país. Por supuesto también estamos a merced de los desastres, todo ello en 5 rondas mas una sexta donde solo se puntúa y poco mas.

El tema de los desastres mola, es una subasta de puntos de ciencia para evitar comerte un desastre que te proporciona contaminación y basura.

Me pareció un juego correcto, pero tampoco es la traca, difícil de recomendar porque ya hay muchos juegos de desarrollo en el mercado y este realmente no sobresale en nada por muy correcto que sea.

Algo que discutimos fue que la rejugabilidad la vemos Comprometida, porque aunque tiene muchas Tiles y no se juega con todas al final no deja de ser 5 rondas iguales donde vas a por uno de los 3 recursos que necesitas o a por centros de reciclaje, independientemente del numero de Tiles y ciudades.

Había escucachado de el que era uno de los tapados de essen 2010 y aunque el juego esta bien tampoco es para tanto.

Nice little bidding game which combines auctions, tile placement, and careful resource management.  The civ theme is barely there but the game is cute enough and fast enough that you dont mind.

Overall a solid game but nothing fantastic.

This game will appeal to auction game fans as a game that is reminiscent of Goa, but without the permutation churn that characterizes the Rudiger Dorn game.  (I happen to rate Goa very highly but that’s neither here nor there.)

There is a spatial element in the tile placements and connections, grafting on a little of the tile-placement fun of Carcassonne without making the entire game about the tile placements.  And the flower/skull symbols provide an interesting and meaningful alternate path to victory.

There’s a fair amount of game here for the 1-hour time frame.  I’d like to play more to see whether I love it or merely like it.  I don’t expect to purchase 20th Century as my tastes run to heavier titles, but it’s a game I’d be happy to see on my shelf if it were gifted to me.

20th Century is a mid-weight auction-based euro. I like it better than Suchy's previous efforts League of Six and Shipyard but some similarity is present. His games all feature a mechanistic approach of going through various phases. While the phases in League of Six felt disjointed and Shipyard was overwrought, 20th Century comes together nicely. Players can follow different paths which all seem to have a good shot at winning. I'm slightly worried that fighting pollution might be too easy as 4 out of 5 players ended up without any waste at game end. I would like to play it more but it is nothing for people who are appalled by JASE, i.e. many different more or less thinly themed ways to gather VPs and grinding out small advantages.

RATING: 6
A nice little auction game that plays quickly and has a fair number of interesting-looking decisions (time will tell whether they really are interesting).

The main potential issue is that there might be a very strong exponential growth feedback loop in the game. Once someone gets a  income advantage (in money, science doesn't have the feedback loop), it will be very hard for anyone to effectively compete for the best tiles. I'm sure experienced players will do their best to block this, but repeat plays will tell how that really works out.

The whole trash mechanism seems a bit underutilized. At least I didn't really feel much pressure from it in either of the games I've played so far.

Combining several different auction mechanics into a tile lying game with some minor civ type elements works fairly well after several plays. The game can suffer from a runaway leader problem if other players are not carful. The pollution element is a nice and thematic addition but tends not to be as big of a problem as many newer player expect (although it can lead to some significant points during end game scoring). Although a balanced approach between money and science may seem the obvious path to doing well, I have seen an early culture point push work well depending on the interim scoring cards that come into play. Overall, a solid game that appears to scale well for 3-5 players (although it can overstay its welcome with larger player counts and AP prone players).

Mix of well-known mechanics and the result is? Too long and repetitive game. There are a way too much auctions AND what's wrong with those auctions is that, there isn't deep enough steps (should be something like 1-3-6-10-15 which would fasten gameplay too). Cutting half of the playtime and this might actually works. What it is now is one more auction and tile-laying game which is not unique enough.

A small auction based tableau building game.  Reminiscent of Industria but a bit richer (cash, science & garbage management).  Also reminiscent of Homesteader but way simpler (less currency types, less interactions, less possibilities).  The theme is strongly pro-ecology with low pollution, garbage recycling and good living conditions being winning strategies.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I know some of my geekbuddies didn't care for this one, but I enjoyed my first play.  The twofold auction using two different currencies add in an interesting flavor, particularly when fighting potential disasters.  While the temptation exists to buy more land, doing so also increases the amount of garbage you take which can be a negative score at the end of the game if not removed.  Sometimes, your land purchase may be dictated by available techs as you want the best one available and must be the first one to drop out of a land auction to purchase said tech tile.  Build your little region Carc style and earn gold, science, and VPs according to which cities you populate on your region (same goes with removing garbage).  Ideally, to score well at the end game, you want to remove the garbage to score your tiles.  Tiles with garbage score nothing and potentially negative if you have 2+ garbage on them.  There's enough here that leaves me wanting to explore more and see if there are various strategies to winning.

I don't think it is possible to win this game if you are not fairly high in the clean air track.  

Sold this one as I don't think there is enough variation to the possible routes to victory.  Clean air is too valuable in this one.

Second time I have played this game at the club.  I remembered a harsh lesson from the first game - early on money and science points are much more important than VPs.  My opponents were playing the game for the first time and went for the points at first - the result, I won quite easily even though I was last on the score track for half the game.

12/15/12 Played a four-player game in 2.1 hours.
Like many Euro games it revolves around building an efficient engine to maximize positives and minimize negatives. That can be mentally rewarding, but its not exciting. I saw a lot of bellyaching on BGG of people who said once you get behind you can't catch up. My game today proves that's just not so. The graphics are clear, though there is the minor problem of once your country is littered with worker disks and garbage cubes its sometimes hard to see what's underneath. It was interesting, but I wonder if it will have staying power. Since its sort of a puzzle game, once you unlock it there may not be much more to keep it fresh. So I joked, "Where are the expansion ocean tiles so I can dump my garbage in the sea during the night when no one is looking like New Jersey?" Overall I found 20th Century to be a good game. For now I'll rate it a "7". Though I fear future outings will be pretty much the same and my rating may drop to a "6".

Made a few errors in the rules, but they should only make it harder, and better in so doing.  Nothing fantastically new. Not much to do with the 20th century, but whatever.  The game itself seems quite fun the first 3 eras, but then you know who will win and it impossible to catch them, even working together.  The garbage accumulation, which should be threatening, in the end is too easy to fix.  In the end, a good idea for a game that fails in execution.  Too bad.

RATING: 7.5
A tile-laying auction game with two currencies: money and science points.  A round consists of auctioning land tiles for money.  These tiles contain some variety of rails and cities which produce either money, science points, VPs or recycling.  The first tile you buy in the land auction comes with 1 garbage, the second comes with 2 garbage, etc.  They each come with one citizen.  When you bow out of the land auction round you can immediately spend science points to pick up one of the technology tiles: these tiles either increase other production centers, provide a new citizen (needed to man a city -- tiles have 1-3 cities which usually produce at different combinations), decrease happiness, remove garbage, transport a citizen (to the next city along a rail) or build a rail.

There is a second auction round where science points are bid.  This auction takes place on the game board until each spot is filled.  The spots all have cards that are usually bad so you're auctioning not to take the worst cards (unhappiness, more garbage, etc.).

Then you produce: $, VPs, SPs and recycling.  Your manned recycling centers can recycle on the tile they're on and orthogonally adjacent tiles connected by rail.

One gets VPs throughout the games through production but the end of the game there is a multiplier for happiness level X number of tiles that do not have garbage on them.  The multiplier is 2,3 or 4 and very important.  There are also additional points at the end of rounds 2 and 4 depending on what cards are drawn that game.  

Finally, tiles with 2 garbage lose 5 points, 3 garbage lose 10 points, etc.  Garbage is bad.

So more of an auction game than a Carcassonne-like tile game.  Although very different it reminded me a bit of Glenmore in feel and length.

After 2 games i rate this on to 6.5 , it's start at 8, but the little ecological theme with  the biding of the tile are really cool.
The game sometimes are overpowered because of the technology tile especially the worker, and some tiles that gave you the flower Icon, but at the end i think it's a really good eurogame, 
the game work perfectly with 5 players so i will suggested to play with this amount of friends. The problem of the game is that sometimes during the game you don't feel the theme, You just try to reach some good tiles, and don't gave them to your opponents.

This is a clever and balanced resource management game where you expand your land and earn resources and points, while keeping pollution at a minimum.  There was bidding, tile placement, and a type of pick-up and deliver in this game that all worked well together.  If you go too far in one direction, you will take penalties.  One of the things I did not like in this game was that no matter what, the penalty will fall on someone every round, even when you consider yourself playing well.

A very enjoyable game where you must balance a few different things while scoring points.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
There is a decent idea at the core: When to drop out of the tile auction and how much blue money to spare for the pollution auction. The execution leaves a lot room for improvement, though.

First of all, there's too much downtime since the tile auction can go on for quite a while after you've dropped out. Also, the solitaire bookkeeping phase leaves too much room for honest or even deliberate player errors. There does not seem to be anything hindering runaway leaders either.

Good game. And that's all. I think this may be better with 3,4 players then 5. IMO there is only one good path leads to victory (recycling). Other are worthless. But it isn't bad :)

Gioco semplice anche se necessita di alcune partite per poter essere padroneggiato appieno e per costruire una strategia valida. Indispensabile sapere che la manovalanza (carte con omini) è scarsa e mentre l'accumulo di rifiuti tende all'infinito (attenzione a perdere troppe aste...). Il gioco si riduce presto ad un solitario nella propria area di gioco dove tra l'altro i movimenti di risorse e rifiuti sono proprio minimi e a tratti frustranti. Le meccaniche sembrano rubacchiate dai migliori giochi in circolazione, dalle tessere alla Carcassone, alle aste per le centrali in stile Power Grid alle aste per non evitare nuovi rifiuti e teschi in stile Principi di Firenze, i coloni sulle tessere ricordano Puerto Rico ecc.. Infine credo che (seppure con poche partite alle spalle) puntare con decisione all'area dei fiorellini porta un bonus in punti vittoria decisamente importante.

I was really blown over by my first play of this game. The resource-juggling is beautifully balanced without reaching into the excesses and uncontrolledness of many games (Hmmm, Mr Rosenberg?), and the map-making aspect seems trite but genuinely throws up a couple of dilemmas. The science/disaster auction phase is gorgeous.

What I like:
- Auctions (2 kinds), resource management, tile-laying in your own sandbox
- It looks like there are multiple paths to victory
- Good variability between the 2 sets of tiles, catastrophes, and interim scoring cards
- 5.5 rounds, and the game is over.
- Cute theme, although they feel like counties, not nations

What I don't like:
- It is frustrating not being able to get more workers
- It is frustrating not being able to move workers and trash around
- The game is very tight, so it feels stressful

Our 4p learning game took 95 minutes, so that wasn't bad at all. The catastrophe auctions were very competitive. Understandably, nobody quite knew how to value the land tiles, nor the techs. I felt like the techs didn't help enough to offset those catastrophes, which were bid up very high by everyone.

I think the BGG-voted weight of 3.0 is about right. The rules complexity is a bit lower, but with all the combinations it plays a bit heavier.

Traded away, because I really just didn't feel like playing it again.

This is a multi-part auction game in which you're bidding on land tiles (which provide resources but also pollution), technology (special abilities, one-shot or ongoing), and disaster avoidance (MAJOR pollution if you fail).  Your land tiles give you income to win future auctions as well as points-income, and sometimes recycling to get rid of your pollution.  Pollution is worth major negatives at the end of the game, so getting the science resource to win the disaster avoidance auction is key.

20th Century is a brilliant mix of auction and tile laying.  The multiple auctions with multiple currencies are tight and gave you a lot to consider as you make your decisions.  The tile placement can be a real challenge and requires some clever spacial reasoning.  I love that you have to find the balance between acquisition, and rapid growth with excess pollution.  I can have a little runaway leader problem, but games with more experienced played should mitigate that.  Overall I think it is a wonderful and overlooked gem.

Great first impression after two plays. The mechanics in the game are all tried and true but the way it is put together makes it really shine. It has elements that I like from other games. Puzzle aspect for putting your city together, a feel of civilization building with the different technology choices and tile choices. Agonizing decisions in the auctions, an element of screwage in the disaster auction, money management, and the agaony of garbage management and loss of VPs. A very good package.

Again, I like the basic premise of the game and the (attempted) mixture of Carcassonne and run-of-the-mill Euro/Economic game. But why give each player his 'own' little country to develop instead of maximizing interaction by (as in Carcassonne) have players build and compete in the same country, helping each other involuntarily, profiting of each other, collaborating in times of need etc., make it less solitaire. The artwork is average but it very well balanced and polished. So, above average Euro which could have been better.

(Rating after two plays, with no desire to play it a third time)  It's a perfectly competent multi-layered auction game that covers very similar ground to - and suffers from the same drawbacks as - last year's Peloponnes. 

In each auction (and there are two, or arguably three, different auction mechanisms employed each round; leaving me to wonder if there wasn't at least a touch of the designer saying "look at me - I've included all this variety in my game!) there are tiles that, after the first round at least, will be worth different amounts to different people.  They are handled competently but not compellingly, and although there might be auctions in which the right bid is really important, over the course of the game I was left with the feeling that none of them really mattered much (and I won my last game quite handily, having been written off by the other players largely as a result of my laissaiz-faire attitude towards the various bidding rounds).

The components are quite pretty, although arguably a bit too pretty given the subject matter, but they all work well enough.

The most telling - and damning - point for me was here was yet another recent game which had no spark for me, no soul, and no sense in which it was anything other than a workmanlike game designed and produced according to the numbers.

A points scoring game in which players try to build a town without generating too much pollution. The game is very similar to a lot of other games in which the player tries to optimise the points available to them from a variety of different sources.
20th Century scores in having a slightly more nuanced auction mechanic in which dropping out and passing are distinguished and in which two different currencies operate. On the downside the theme is very dry and some elements (such as tile placement feel a bit OTT).

This is one of several games that can be acquired cheaply here in the UK at The Works - and I played this in February 2015 at our local games club because one of members bought it there. (This is still my only play to date.) I was quite impressed with the game - there seemed to be interesting decisions and several routes to victory (one player scored zero in-game VPs but leapt up to second place as a result of the endgame scoring!), and the mechanics, while none of them are revoluationary (it has auctions, tile-laying and a few economic elements), seemed fairly fresh in how everything worked together. While I didn't come away thinking I absolutely must play it again soon, I would be more than happy to give it another try at any time.

RATING: 7
An interesting euro that's heavy on bidding and spacial elements. The main auction adds a lot of tension considering the first person to drop out of the running gets dibs on the best technology tiles, but ends up paying more in the process. The longer you stay in, the cheaper the land tiles may get, but the technology is mainly picked over by the time you drop out.

Disaster bidding is done Amun-Re style, as each player has to constantly re-bid to pay according to the severity of the disaster. Only one player is going to escape the disaster unscathed, so the rest of the players find out how much they are willing to pay for the less severe disasters. One player is always stuck with the worst, but ends up not having to pay. Very cool auction mechanic, it puts value on both types of currency. I happened to neglect collecting science points, and I really took a lot of heat in the disaster rounds.

Finally, all players add newly acquired tiles, use technology tiles and take income and recycle. This round involves Carcassonne-esque tile placement for optimal production from functioning cities. All the while trying to figure out how to deal with the surmounting garbage. Adds a solitaire element to a fairly interactive bidding game. The strategic decisions of placing a tile are very agonizing but satisfying. If a tile or citizen disc was placed wrong, tough luck. It's impossible to move tiles, and difficult to move citizens around.

I found the game very fun. It didn't blow me away, but I enjoyed playing it, and I'd love to get it to the table again to refine my strategy. it's certainly not going to revolutionize the euro genre, but I think 20th century fills a nice niche in my collection.

The 20th Century was gone, featured by booming economy and mass pollution. If we got a chance to do it again, will it be such a mess? This game is about environment and quality of life. It's a hybrid of Power Grid's bidding, Carcassone's tile placement and Through The Ages's production and scoring. Th theme is great but the mechanics are, if not dull, non-innovative. Anyway it's a good way to awake the awareness of protecting the earth.

A fun tile-laying game that uses an auction to choose the tiles you'll be acquiring. I like that there are reasons to stay in the auction as long as possible since it allows you to buy more tiles at cheaper prices, but the technology tiles encourage you to drop out of the auction early. The auction for disasters is well designed as well.

Nice thematic game that's very heavy on the auctions and valuing what will fit well with what you have and need in your area. It's very easy to follow what's going on here - more so than Peloponnes, which it reminds me of. Where Peloponnes has more random timing of chaotic events (that can really change the game from game to game), here the pollution/garbage is more manageable as you can plan where you'll get it and position your recycling centres to deal with it.

Plays well with a full compliment of five, as you'd expect with an auction game, but I like it more with four as it feels less chaotic. Takes just over an hour and is a nice mid level of strategy and thinking. The variation your get game to game with the scoring cards will see games play out differently, as different cards mean different goals. You don't want to miss out on picking up a pile of points at these two points as they're substantial points. The three part auction is nice - especially the two first parts (okay, the second part isn't an auction so much, but the timing is tied into the land auction), where you have to weigh up grabbing good land tiles with grabbing the technology tiles before the other players. The third disaster auction unfortunately is the weaker link as it slows down the game a bit, but the effects are rather significant, especially as you see where players stand later in the game.

If you're an auction fan and looking for a bit of a theme, then this is a good one.

Good range of strategic paths that seem fairly well balanced.  The "garbage auction" feels a bit clunky; the problem is that the second currency doesn't do enough without it but it is needed for the game to work properly.

RATING: 6.7
Fiddly tile placement, auctions that you never have enough money for, and for my taste generally too much complexity compared to the fun you get.

I kind of like the main idea of the game about not only building a civilization, but also having to deal with the garbage problem, but the implementation is just a bit too fiddly, especially with all those rules about how workers can travel vs. how garbage can travel vs. how bonus resources can "travel". Why not just "a recycling center can remove garbage from any adjacent tile"? Why not just "a locomotive can move a worker to any free city"? All this railway building and proximity optimization just needlessly protracts the game.

Other minor flaws of the game include run-away leaders (which to some extent can be fixed by experience and just not giving them the chance to run away), quite some luck/unpredictability with the desaster cards -- "Do I invest all my science this turn, or will something even worse come up next?" -- (which probably can be fixed by making them public at the beginning of the game), and a somewhat malfunctioning auction system in which even if you don't want to buy anything, you want to auction off a few tiles before dropping out so that the science tile prices go down (which probably could be fixed by dropping the price once per sold science tile instead of once per sold landscape tile).

That I just suggested four house rules in a quick review doesn't exactly speak in favour of the game. It's an okay game and I don't mind playing it once in a while, but I'm not compelled to buy it either.

Oh, and speaking of fiddly: What this game absolutely needs is a smart phone app that takes a photo of your city and calculates your income. It's plainly embarrassing how I sometimes try to count three times and get three different results.

A less interesting Industria.  The game has some good stuff going on, and it is engaging. But isn't particularly wow inducing either.  It's fully functional and is a nice solid design.  It's the kind of game where you wouldn't regret buying it and I'd probably have to think hard about trading it, but it is competing against time spent playing other, better games of its ilk.

As typical with many of the newer Eurogames, you kind of do your own thing and take tactical advantage of timing and availability.  It isn't solitaire, as the auction pits players against each other, but really there isn't much you can do to change what your fellow player is doing unless you are already planning to do what they were hoping to do. So while you are competing, this is more a efficiency racing game. Because of that, I feel that there is a fall-away loser problem to the game. 

You know you've lost by turn three.  There are lots of auctions and once someone gets their production ramped up they can dominate.  Experienced players might take certain precautions, but it's got Outpost written all over it.

The point of an auction game is that the different items are worth different amounts to different players. That doesn't happen much in 20th Century, and when it does it's opaque. The game takes too long and the intensive town-management doesn't add enough interest for the effort.

This is a tile-laying, civ-building-themed, worker-placement game all about auctions. There are 2 currencies -- gold and science -- that are used to bid. Players each start with the same gold/science, and starting city tile showing 3 cities connected by roads, and 2 workers to place on 2 of these cities. Cities in this game, when manned, generate some combination of gold/science/VP, and/or recycle (remove a pollution cube from that tile, or a connected adjacent tile). Their player boards show the status of their city: gold/science/VP income per turn, ecologic state of their city (+ or - VP at end of game, as well as determining the value of each unpolluted land tile at end of game).

Each Round starts with a phase auctioning randomly drawn tiles (but 3 separate stacks: for Rounds I-II, III-IV, and V) using gold. Each tile purchased comes with a worker and an extra pollution cube (1 with 1st, 2 with 2nd, etc.) -- which may only be placed on that tile. As players drop out of this auction, the price of technology goods falls one step; they may buy ONE tech tile when they drop out, using the science currency. Technologies may give you more workers to place, trains to allow you to move workers each turn, industry tiles to boost connected cities' incomes, etc. After everyone has finished these parts of the Round, there's an Evo-style science-currency auction for various bad things (pollution cubes, worsening ecology); there's a new card for each round (randomly chosen). There is a final step, but only in the advanced game (haven't played that yet) -- additional ways to earn VP. The player who ended up with the worst item in this auction will be starting the land auction next round.

After all tiles have been acquired, players place their pollution cubes on them and incorporate them into their city. Unusually, you _are_ allowed to place tiles connected only diagonally, and the roads do NOT have to line up with the adjacent tile. Players collect whatever gold/science/VP their city generates, then you move on.

The 6th round is abbreviated: no auctions; simply run your city one more time. Then final VP are awarded to players according to ranks in gold/science in hand, players gain/lose points based on the status of their city, and earn/lose pts for pollution: a clean land tile scores VP according to city status (2-4); one pollution cube = 0VP; 2+ cubes = -5VP per cube beyond the first!

There's quite a bit going on here, but the game plays pretty smoothly -- excellent job, for the most part, on board layout and design -- and quickly and there are a lot of tough decisions throughout. Penalties for not managing garbage well seem harsh, though: seems doubtful that one can win by focusing on something else, largely ignoring trash? But maybe that's the point....

Whilst not a fan of Shipyard I thought it contained a host of great ideas and mechanics. I am really looking forward to see how Vladimer's design ideas have moved in a year.

...and backwards is the answer. Thematic nonsense as players auction land for their get rich but polluting kingdom

Far too much time absorbed in your own tile tableau, far too little time interacting via the auctions. Reminds me of Glen More but much worse. 

boring art work does not help.

And the price point is uttetly absurd. The Rio Grande edition has an RRP of £49.99 in the UK and 35 Euros 22 miles across the English channel .It's language independent so guess whats going to happen? 

As of Feb 2011 its being discounted down to 12 Euros by German distibutors. What incentive is there for Uk Re and E tailers to stock this game? 

edit Feb 2012 - now UK distributor has had to cut price by two thirds.

Interesting choice to force player to consider environmental damage that occurs from growth, but overall it's just not really my cup of tea.

Weaker points for me is the heavily scripted nature of the game. I'm not a fan of games where I have to keep track of what round it is to do certain special events or raise prices or whatever. It's not a very "systemic" game, in that it doesn't just provide some core rules that naturally result in prices, say, going up.

I bought this because of the designer, of whom I really enjoy his previous 2 games. While the mechanisms are quite different from shipyard, it did give me a similar feel.

The variable scoring methods means that you can't simply find one winning strategy.

Solid biding game. First you need money to get tiles. The more tiles you get in a round, the more garbage you must take. You don`t want garbarge (minus points). Then you need science points to get technologies that helps you, then you need also science points to get the less bad event. So it seems science is more important than money. You need science points twice in a round and it seems to be more important to get a less bad event, than a concrete tile in the first biding phase (there are more tiles than players, so you probaply get a tile).

You can try 3 strategies - 1. Many tiles -> much money and science points, just more tiles. You get much garbage, so you can get the recykling tiles.

2. Many points from the beginning of the game.

3. Get as many flowers as you can - more points for every tile at the end of the game (you don`t need many tiles to have many points), and many points when you are in the "flower area".

The problem is only strategy 3 works. Ok, Power Grid or Factory Manager has also only one path, but in that games you don`t see other strategies. Oh, Factory Manager - 20th Century is in some kind similar (2 resources, you try to have much in both categories, biding). The game feeling is similar, but 20th Century is more interesting. But it`s only a solid game.

This game flew under my radar.  Despite being a relatively recent game and, apparently, having been played in my group from time to time, I had never actually seen the game before.

This is a game that I knew I'd like as soon as we got into the rules.  Which, as usual, means I was horrible at it.  It's a pretty straightforward auction to get resource generating stuff, to win more auctions, to generate vp's all while mitigating bad stuff (garbage and ecological devastation).  But it's well done and it presents difficult choices and decisions, which, for me, is what gaming is about.  

I'm looking forward to my next play.

In the 20th Century, every country strives to develop and improve, each in its own way. Some become financial leaders. Others become centers of learning. Both science and commerce serve to propel nations toward the future – but toward what kind of future? Growth produces waste, and the greatest advances may come with the greatest cost to the environment. How will these countries mitigate the inevitable ecological catastrophes?

Your goal is to build a land free of garbage and pollution – a land where the environment is as healthy as the economy. Only then can you consider your country to be truly developed.
The game consists of six rounds, during which you oversee the urbanization of your country. Some lands produce income. Some produce scientific research. Others improve the quality of life. Your research allows you to discover new technologies that will shape the way your nation develops. Science can even help you avert ecological catastrophes. At the end of each round, your lands provide you the money and research that you will need to deal with the challenges of the next round.

You accumulate points each round, based on your nation’s quality of life. At the end of rounds two and four, you also score bonus points for certain aspects of your country’s development. At the end of round six, you will score bonus points based on your country’s income, research, and environmental quality. The player with the most points wins, having built the country with the highest standard of living.

Theme is eye-catching.  Sustainability is not something that jives well with the usual implicit economic theory of ever-expanding growth that features in most Euro-games.  Unfortunately, the theme is not particularly well-implemented.  Garbage and pollution are so heavily abstracted that they feel like just another output from the system, but one you want to minimize rather than maximize.  The game also gets away from theme with questionable design choices like auctions and a strange technology mechanic.  It also had problems with a runaway leader if players aren't careful.  If cube-cranking is your thing, this game will provide, but if you want a nuanced treatment of the theme, it's better to give this one a miss.  [gameid=72225] is a good place to start.

Tile laying game, where you bid on land tiles, acquire technologies, to try and deal with the ever increasing amounts of garbage piling up in your cities. We were taught some rules incorrectly at Origins, making the game much tougher than it actually is, because tiles were harder to use.

Being a bit of a "greenie", I loved the theme of course. Tile laying and building up personal areas is always enjoyable. We enjoyed it enough that we played it again immediately, trying to invent a 2 player variant on the spot. It wasn't perfect, or as good as the 4 player game, but it worked well enough that it turned it into a potential buy, whereas the 3+ player count before made it an automatic no-buy for us.

What I like most about this game so far is the way that the bidding works between the tiles and the technologies.  It creates the right sorts of incentives to in turn create some good challenges in how to pick what is most useful to you, and that makes for a good tension in the game.  The game also forces you to find the right level between pollution and progress, since the former hurts you, and the latter helps you.  There is a lot of randomness in the game, which is somewhat tempered out by the auction mechanism, but getting what you need at the right time can sometimes be a little frustrating if the luck isn't in your favor.  It's certainly an intriguing game that I want to play more, but it feels very uninspired and forgettable.

Όμορφο παιχνίδι ανάπτυξης συνδιάζει με ωραίο τρόπο αρκετά στοιχεία,όπως auction και tile placement.
Έχει διάρκεια 120 λεπτά και παίζεται από 3-5 παίχτες.
Στόχος ειναι να δημιουργήσεις μια πόλη που να είναι καθαρή από σκουπίδια και μολύνσεις.
Νικητής είναι αυτός που στο τέλος θα έχει μια πόλη με το υψηλότερο επίπεδο διαβίωσεις.

Interesting game mechanics, but it's a bit to dry for my taste. Second complaint may be its repleyability, but since i played only once, i'll have to check it in a time to come.

Fun game. I like how much variability there is with most aspects (tiles, scoring, catastrophes). This strikes me as the type of game that gets better with more plays; I could see my rating rising to a 9 with this. I usually don't like games where there are auctions with multiple simultaneous lots, but this one handles it nicely by bidding on avoidance of bad stuff rather than trying to value disparate things. I also suspect this will play significantly faster than the stated 2 hours if people know how to play.

It's pretty good, but doesn't follow through on the promise it shows.

A solid 7 Euro that flew under the radar or got lost in a myriad of other similar games. Good green theme if you want to feel good playing a game about improving the environment.

Interesting auction/resource management game.  But, I think it has a pretty significant rich get richer problem.  Also, I'm not entirely sure that the main interesting mechanic (garbage) really matters that much.  Not because scoring doesn't reward getting rid of garbage, but rather because garbage seems to be relatively easy to get rid of.

Interesting at first. But after 5 plays, i'm already burned out on it.

Warning: Don't play with AP prone people. 120 minutes is already too long for what the game delivers.

Bidding and civilization sim based on the economic optimization principle of nations that specialize. The goal of the game is to build a civilization that prospers AND is a responsible steward of our planet. The trick is to manage economic growth while minimizing your garbage and pollution. Cool bid mechanic spending science in the environment damage auction. After bidding, place claimed land tiles on your tableau. Strategy of when to opt out for a science tile.

Proviene de un cambio con Krivalis de la BSK, por el Band of Heroes de LnL. Juego de gestión recursos combinado con colocación de losetas. Me gusta el matiz de la eficiencia energética combinado con la eliminación de residuos.

Nothing new but I liked how the game is played. Carcassonne on steroids plus some bidding and managing your city and trash. And the artwork is great and rich in details

Played a couple of times and has some lovely bidding mechanics, but, the one failing is you can't really keep an eye on opponents scoring, its a bit haphazard removing pollution and moving cities etc that the game only works if you trust your opponents. For me and my range of players this isn't an issue.

All the decisions, in and of themselves, are pretty much tradeoffs.  Your challenge is to make synergistic choices toward a greater strategy.  As such, this game provides pretty singular gameplay experience.  The downtime caused by the [thing=15364][/thing]-style auctions to dodge negative effects, and even by the more traditional round-robin auctions for the land tiles can be excessive, which detracts from the game some.

Decent game with some things you've likely not seen before. I'm a bit of a sucker for Civ/City Building so I'm likely to be more forgiving than others.

RANK: 105

RATING: 9.4
Solves some of the problems I have with typical euro games. Rulebook was particularly pleasant. Player interaction can be quite interesting on this one. One of the most critical elements is driven purely by chance, making each round predictably unpredictable. Recommended by Evan S., Kevin S., and Essen Spiel reviews.

Complex and pretty tight game. You always want to do more than you can. Not very accessible, though, and I had to read the rulebook a few times and also watch a video or two before I got the hang of it. If it weren't for that it would have been a 9. EDIT: The game has grown on me and is now rated a 9.

This gets more fun the more we play it. Like all the choices. Great!

RATING: 7.5
A mish-mash of tried and true mechanics lifted from other games (Luna, Glory To Rome, Agricola, Yspahan), combined with some new ideas that all comes together in a very cohesive, fun, and strategic game about building up your farming principality over 6 rounds of play.

Each player starts the game with their own farm/player mat that has 4 sides for slotting cards to develop their farm, as well as a hand of cards (also a pittance of money, resources and points to start).  A game round consists of 4 phases which are very nicely laid on clear player aids.  In the first phase (Farming), players play a card to their principality and each card has potentially 4 different functions only 1 of which will be used (as a field to grow crops, as a contract to complete for points, as a farm extension to improve your farm's "abilities", or as a unique farmer ability similar to Agricola).  Then players receive income, which early on is limited and is generally coins, then they potentially get crop growth and animal reproduction (pigs are the only animal in the game and it's difficult to reproduce them), then they can purchase (optionally) a roof, which is like a delayed free action that costs money but also grants a small amount of points (you have 6 rounds to buy 5 roofs so you can get away with not purchasing once if you're short on coin).

The second phase is Income and here the starting player rolls dice which are allocated to resources/actions that players will choose in turn order (each player gets 2 die therefore 2 actions, which could potentially be the same).  Finally 1 die will be left over and all players get this action.  This is a phase that's good for everyone but it is a bit unpredictable and going earlier in turn order is preferable. 

The third phase is Deliveries/Siesta.  Each player has an identical set of action tiles that are a mix of deliveries (donkey symbols) and/or siesta (a snoozing hat).  Players secretly choose their tile and reveal in turn order and they are either moving up on the siesta track (for small amount of points and advancement in turn order) or they are choosing to deliver goods to contracts.  If you deliver goods, you can deliver to your own personal contracts (market barrows) and/or to the main board (craft buildings).  There are advantages to both; market barrows when completed give you points, a free trade good (these are flexible resources that can be cashed in at any time), and a placement in the market that has the same mechanics as the temple in Luna (you can bump out other players for points and you score points for each marker at the end of the round).  Craft buildings give you points based on the round (later is better) and grant a craft token, of which there are 6 different ones and they pay out a bonus each round so the earlier you get them the better (that's the tradeoff).

The last phase is Scoring, where you score for your placement in turn order and for markers present in the main market.  

The game scales very well from 2-4 players (haven't played solo yet, but it does play solo), it actually runs very smoothly and quickly (shorter than the box says) and it has definite replayability due to all of the unique cards and options with the cards.  Seems ripe for an expansion and definitely deserves the wider release it will be getting.

LIKE: This game centers around the multi-use cards, and each choice you make with the cards is well balanced, making the choices agonizing. I like the subtle nuances in the delivery competition for either crafts or the center market.

DISLIKE: I didn't like the rulebook, because I felt the "names" of the different areas on the board felt too abstract and not intuitive. I also felt the three phases were disconnected and each phase had several parts. Why not just make each part a phase? Not intuitive when reading the rulebook. Luckily, one play clears everything up. Also, the game does not have much player to player interaction.

OVERALL: After a couple rounds, the game started to click and I enjoyed it. I can see why other people like it because each card was powerful and fun, but you had to decide how to use it. The game felt good even at 2 players.

RATING: 7.5
This isn't my normal type of game. I like Euros that are slick and tight with some original sparkle. La Granja is none of that. It's a sprawling cacophony of interlocking bits. It mirrors many other games - Agricola in growing crops, Yspahan in dice allocation of actions, countless Euros in converting one thing to another. This game will confuse and thus punish first time players which limits appeal. But with all that, I still want to play it again - and maybe a few times. It has lots of area to explore for sure - even with the mechanical nonsense.

A really excellent game! We are a Group of Strategy-Gamers (Agricola, le Havre, Terra Mystica, Caverna etc.)and we played it with Mike Keller and it was very convincing. Granja has a lot of interesting game mechanisms, you have many possibilitys which strategy you choose. All in all the game is very balanced and exciting till the end. The Cards make every game unique and open new ways. Also, the Design looks nicely. We had a lot of fun playing it and I can definitely recommend it. I will surely buy it as soon as it comes out!

Good game but success is in the card combos.  Don't get a good combo going soon enough?  You're done.  Half the trick is having a good combo available, half the trick is recognizing you have the combo available, and half the trick is execution.  (Yes, that's a lot of halves - deal with it.)  I'd like to play this more, but... well, it just doesn't seem like it does it for me.

1st play: great mix of 3 of the best designers in board gaming. The art isn't quite as great as it could be but its not bad. Very interesting mechanically and solid engine building potential with lots of opportunity for tactical play. My only gripe is that the game feels like it might end before my engine is built, and there isn't a lot to distinguish the first round from the last. Not sure if that's the game's fault or mine. 

2nd play: Played with 3, and the game is great. Tons of combo-ability, engine building is souped up with the second play and more experience about how to proceed. Lots of opportunities to choose a path and the multiple card powers ensure that each game and each tableau feels different.

This is a really great euro. Going to publish a full review soon, but the short version is that this is a consistently interesting game full of choices that matter, and has player interaction without a lot of meanness. The area control of the market stalls becomes very interesting in the mid to late game and this game gives a very real sense of progress that carries with it a sense of satisfaction. Can't recommend it enough to euro fans. 

FYI: the game looks busy and the player aid is at first baffling, but it flows very well once you understand play and the player aid is incredible, one of the best ever made for a game of this weight.

I suppose it was inevitable that the evolutionary path of efficiency games would lead to ever more complex puzzles.  La Granja follows that path by throwing together a sackful of elements (Glory to Rome's multi-use cards, dice drafting, resource conversion, buildings and roofs that offer special powers and several ways to score vps).  It certainly does feel more an assemblage of mechanics and less about building up a farm than did Agricola.  Nonetheless, credit to the designers that this Frankenstein's monster actually works and - once over a significant learning curve - is really quite playable.  However, for me it still has the cold, clockwork heart of an efficiency game.

The artwork is pleasant enough.  I felt that the main board should have been a little larger.  Too much is crammed into it to potentially confusing effect.  Some of the icons are also a strain for these ageing eyes.

Great Euro game with plenty of choices each round.  I love how the cards have 4 uses and the player boards are designed to hole the cards revealing the relevant information.  Rules are simple enough and set-up is quite quick.  Solo rules are okay and the automa variant adds a much better experience.

RATING: 6
I was certainly looking forward to playing La Granja given the recent buzz about the game. Perhaps my expectations were too high.  

I found La Granja to be a well designed complex resource conversion challenge...that really was not much more than that.  It seemed surprisingly thin thematically, perhaps because it used an "all different resources are denoted by your color marker" approach to "tally" your resources.  

Suggesting that this game is similar to Agricola, I believe, is misleading.  In Agricola, the central thematic focus is to build and improve your farm and farm home.  In Agricola, you often feel like you ARE farming (since you actually simulate sowing and growing crops), that you HAVE a farm family (since they become your workers), and that these animals ARE your animals (since you build pastures for them and see them in the fields).  

In La Granja the overriding desire at all times is to gain resources to satisfy or fill "orders" for goods to get more and more VP chits. You acquire and "tally" resources on your farm and use your tallied resources to deliver and fill orders.  Dry.  

Agricola is fundamentally and inextricably a celebration of the worker placement mechanic.  La Granja is, at best, an oblique take on worker placement.  La Granja felt to me like a curious collection of mechanics that each round, we were asked to participate in, but these mechanics really had marginal thematic connection. 

I found it curious that La Granja borrowed the spatial "bump other players off if they are on lower numbers" board from Feld's Luna.  Did it work in La Granja?  For me, not so much. 

Yes, the "four uses for each card" was interesting, and I think the designer provided appreciable complexity and replayability to his design, but I found the game to be just too dry and "unrelated mechanics" filled to want to play the game again.  Have to give the game a 6.

No single path to victory as there are a few different ways to get points and try to get the jump on your opponent. Incredibly fun and interesting dice drafting and card selection game.

Lovely theme, beautiful game board and player boards, and a farming/economic game worthy of standing shoulder to shoulder with greats like Agricola. The player boards are so neat, how you play farming cards to different positions for different resources and effects, and I like how the dice are used for revenue, as well as how player markers become different goods dependent on what space they are placed on. I'd say this one is a medium weight Euro that leans right just a little bit, but fairly intuitive once you've played a couple rounds.

These guys should get an award for polished blandness. 

In theory, this game could be fun. The mechanics seem smart and interesting, but in the end, it's another bean counting game with limited interaction - which would be fine if the existing interaction mechanics would not be blocking and weirdly removing points. Also, the design and theme are just ... lacking creativity somehow. Maybe I want more excitement in games? Right now I think it's mostly humor it needs...

I have only played this game with 2, guess it will get better with 3 o 4 players. I like that it's an efficient game, i like that it has dice drafting, and several other mechanisms in one package, but i feel sometimes that because it has so many phases and steps, im focusing more on each step and not on the strategies. It's very easy to forget something , the theme is very thin and it's more about the mechanisms than really feeling like you are running a farm.
i think the best thing about this game are the cards, because you can play them in different ways. but what I consider great for me, for others maybe bad, because it provokes AP because of the many choices it presents you. final thoughts: solid game, willing to play. but not even close to Fields of Arle or Agricola

RATING: 8.3
Initial rating after playing twice (both 2-player games). On the negative side, the game is somewhat fiddly, and it's very easy to forget to take points for certain actions (whenever you deliver everything requested at a warehouse, it's followed up by a number of "take this, score points for that, ..." actions, and it's easy to skip one or more. Similarly, many helper functions on cards trigger based on other things happening. Additionally, there's quite a bit of luck of the draw in the hand cards you get. Some helper actions are much more obviously useful than others, and if all your cards show low - or high - value carts, while you'd prefer the other type, that can have quite some impact on how you do in the game.
Despite this, the game is chockful of interesting decisions, and stretches your brain a bit as you puzzle your way to making use of your available actions and goods in an efficient manner. Replayability seems good, too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Overall, I enjoyed my first play of La Granja. Mechanically, this is a euro with a very interesting mix of mechanics; It has the card-play of Glory to Rome and the dice drafting of Bora Bora. For gamers that enjoy medium-weight euros, this game certainly warrants a look.

That being said, I question the longevity of this game because it seems too well-balanced. The balance issues seem to stem from the fact that there are numerous ways to do the same thing, which mitigate the importance of any one decisions. Furthermore, this attribute reduces the tension in the game and shifts this euro more towards the solitaire experience. 

Again, I need to play the game more to fully appreciate it. But I see the game more as a mix of interesting ideas rather than the epitome of good game design. Still, I had fun playing it and look forward to my next game.

Played with three which I suspect is the sweet spot.  The game is the type I enjoy most.  Lots of possibilities and  choices which the game system allows you to do, rather than stops you doing.  The multi-use cards and the player board layouts and card lay outs were inspired, new to me and very clever.  There is limited player interaction and what there is this is largely through the game system, rather than direct, which I prefer.  The presentation has a slight ‘home-made’ feel, which is engaging and attractive.  My first game finished 57-57-56. You don’t get much closer than that.  Getting good card combinations is clearly a key to winning and likely to mean the experienced players will do better. Maybe a minor concern that some could be a tad too strong in certain circumstances.  But maybe not in such an over powering was as in Agricola.  The delayed availability of parts of the board will also mean each game has a different feel.  Enjoyable and absorbing.

I quite enjoy this mish-mash of Rosenberg/Feld/and Chudyk.  I like the dice drafting and the managing of the economies.  I like the way the market works with it's light "area control" feel.  

I'm not sure that the multi-use cards create the same sort of interesting decision space that you would normally expect...they are almost too flexible so no one card ends up seeming THAT much more useful than another.  As a result you don't come across moments where you really want to use one card for different things.  It's just as easy to find multiple cards to fill each need.

Keverjünk össze jó sok ismert mechanizmust, hogy kapjunk egy bonyolult eurogémet. Nem sok eredeti szorult bele, sok másik játék beugorhat az egyes részmechanizmusokról (Luna, Glory to Rome, stb.), de nem rossz az összkép végül is. 
A négyfunkciós kártya nagyon nagy újrajátszhatóságot visz bele szerintem, egyébként is úgy érzem, hogy kismillió féle nyerési stratégia lehet benne, tehát ebből a szempontból jó. Néhány helyen kicsit erőltetettnek éreztem, a mechanika miatt megerőszakolták a témát (pl. a piacon eladok valamit, ezután ki lehet nyitni a következő standot... de megértem hogy kellett, mert így mindig más és más dolgokat lehet eladni a különböző partik elején, ettől is csak változatosabb).
Egy helyen konkrétan hibás szerintünk a segédlet, hiányzik róla egy fontos infó a GYP-vel kapcsolatban, néhol a szabály is zavarosnak tűnt (malacos rész). A kártyasegédlet viszont nagyon részletes, és profi, ez tetszett!!

Összességében ajánlom a kicsit bonyolultabb eurok kedvelőinek. Ha már többet játszott vele a csapat, simán lemehet 2 óra alatt, nekünk 3 volt.

Another game I though about purchasing, but luckily was able to get a play beforehand.

This (and [thing=133848][/thing]) made me realise that I dislike it when every player has a bunch of cards that all tweak or break some rules of the game.
Or at least, said is true for longer and heavier titles.

To add insult to injury the multi-purpose cards are very cluttered which gave me a surprisingly hard time processing them.

A totaly hyped game. Does not have anything original, all mechanics are from other games and the dice roll action selection is already seen since Yspahan, and copied from a lot of Feld games. Now you see it again and think its a great game. So tired from this dice mechanics. Please bring something original. 
The best of this game is the use of the cards in different ways, but because of that you can make a real unbalanced combos.

First Play: 4 players all first timers. The rule book is much clearer than Ruhrschiffahrt and K&K but is still a little fiddly in places. Some of the helper actions need further clarification. 

Multiple paths to victory but with a first play none of us really knew what the best actions should be but all acknowledged that you cant do everything. Final scores were all very close. All agreed we need to play again.

Fantastic Euro game. It incorporates classic elements from many other games, but creates something new and exciting with them. The 4-way cards are, simply put, awesome. The entire resource system is elegant and easy. Great player board, reference guide, etc. Nice wooden dice.

There's a little AP potential when trying to analyze all your cards - a hand of 5 or 6 cards means you're looking at 20-24 options. How do you string those options with what you already have out and what you could play in the future?

If you have ever liked a Euro, check this game out as soon as possible.

La Granja is more streamlined and mainstream than most of the other Spielworxx titles that I've played. It's a mid weight solid game with a hodgepodge of mechanics that work well. While not introducing something incredibly innovative, what it does it does well.

What I enjoy about the game is the puzzle of trying to figure which card you are playing, where you are playing it, how your engine develops from there and the timing of the deliveries. You are basically playing cards from your hand into your farm which will dictate in which direction you are headed. It was fun and interesting making these decisions. Most of the time you are in your own little world converting resources and figuring out the timing of things; so it does have a multiplayer solitaire feel to it, but nothing major that would detract from the game. From there, it is mostly your standard Euro where you are converting this into that, albeit with a certain charm to it.

There are two main ways of making points; delivering goods to the Craft buildings or to the Market stalls. The player interaction comes in trying to deliver the goods first to gain extra points in the Craft buildings which grant tiles that benefit you for the rest of the game and timing your deliveries to the Market stalls to gain extra points by knocking out players from the center of the board. The player interaction is not enough to make a big difference or huge impact in negating your opponent of some crucial necessity. The interaction was described in my group as minimal. I personally don't mind this, but some do.

La Granja is a solid game with interesting decisions, great production values and fun gameplay.

This is a really nice game. I'm impressed with the cards and how they provide so many different options. The cards and player boards are well designed to make it pretty easy to use. One thing I found slightly annoying was how some of the special abilities on the card (bottom) did not specify with a symbol or something more obvious when they happen; so, they were easy to miss. It would have been very easy to forget the bonus points for the round you are in when picking up square tiles from the market board if I didn't have a more experienced player reminding us. Otherwise, considering how much is going on in the game, it works really well together! I'll play this more.

Wow.  This might end up being my favorite "Euro" game from 2014.  Tons of decisions, a reasonable play time, and lots of fun!  It really does have a Feld / Chudyk feel, and I am actually shocked this wasn't picked up by a larger publisher. There does seem to be TONS of paths to victory, and obviously, like any good Euro game, you will not be able to do everything, so you will have tough choices to make.  REALLY looking forward to playing this more.

// Fun game, but a little dry. I like the combination of
multi-use cards and dice rolling to take actions - both
are fun mechanics. My complaints about this game have to do
with the VP chips - always annoying to deal with, and prone
to cause mistakes, which can be a big deal when it comes to
final scoring - and with the secondary markets not feeling
nearly as strong as just shipping market barrows over and
over. All in all, I like this game quite a bit, and I'd
play this one over something somewhat similar like Grand

When summing up the mechanics should have a lot going for it, but it fell flat for me. There's too much going on and a lot seems disconnected. The game looks good and has some nice ideas, but it's too much of a mish mash. It feels overdesigned somehow, Should play it again for a more fair assessment maybe, but I don't see that happening if I'm honest.

Very intriguing game.

The theme is one of the most used in boardgaming. Not very appealing, but it works.

The mechanisms are interesting, mostly the cards with 4 different uses. 
The game is not hard to grasp, there's a learning curve that can take a while, but once you get there...

Everything seems good in La Granja, but it's fidly. The resource production, product allocation and so on... seems a fidly process.

Nonetheless a good game!

RATING: 7
This euro game is awesome. You can't feel any theme playing it. But this is not what's important here. The biggest plus it gets owing to cards - You can use them 4 different ways. Dices make game more difficult (but I wouldn't say they make game random). Because of them You can't precisely predict what's Your opponent plan to do and sometimes You have to change Yours to stay in the game.

- it is totally about farming and selling goods on the market in the village (Esporles on the island of Mallorca really exists - that is all about theme)
- game has aggressive interaction between players (especially on the market)

- playing time (90-120 minutes)
- brain killer
- for players without paralysis of decision-making!

IF YOU LIKE DRY EUROGAMES  WITH STRONG, MEAN INTERACTION YOU SHOULD TRY THIS ONE!!!

First play with 4 went well.  Everyone started to really click by round 3 and into round 4, interesting scoring combos began to emerge.  I think each of us pursued different strategies and each was quite viable.  In my enthusiasm, I didn't really clue into how heavy the game actually is, but it definitely sits in the med-heavy space for my group.  Beautiful to look at and a really great combo of mechanics.  I traded it because it was marginalized in my group because of complexity.  Plus someone offered me Lewis & Clark and that was an agreeable trade.

The badest things in La Granja are the tiny counters and tiles. This game needs IMO a deluxe version with bigger components and lift up player tableaus to place the cards easier under them. But otherwise you can play that fizzly game on a bar table, and the game itself is very good in it´s mechanisms to be played. Crossover with elements of Luna and other well known games.

RATING: 8
Excellent farming type game without the need to feed your people.  The different spots you can put cards makes for some good choices and once you actually get into the game it is not too complicated as you expand, grow, fulfill orders, and score points.  Two player was not bad but I would like to play this with more.

RATING: 7
 It has a bit of Rosenberg's feel but simpler. It also has a lot of Feld's point salad feel, but with special power cards.  I'd say La Granja rather than Caverna deserves the title "'Gric 2.0"... ultimately it's a card game played on a board but this time with more interaction and with the addition of multi-use cards to mitigate (theoretically) the luck of the draw.

Un euro de calcular mucho. Dura seis turnos. En cada turno, se ejecutan cuatro fases, en las que se pueden utilizar cartas, mover mercancías de un sitio a otro, y en fin, unas cuantas cosas. Tiene una ayuda-guión que es muy buena. Se coge fácilmente la mecánica del juego, aunque jugarlo bien debe ser bastante complicado.
Me gustó sobremanera el uso que hace de las cartas. Se pueden usar sobre el tablero propio de cuatro maneras diferentes, y según como se coloquen tienen diferentes utilidades. (un poco como el gloria a Roma). 
Es un juego exigente en planificación. Recomendado para jugones con perfil euro. Mejor no plantearselo a gente no acostumbrada. Muchas cosas que pensar.

Sleek little euro that reminds me of viticulture for some reason (even though they really have little in common). It's very simple to play and yet has some really good depth. Most of the meat comes in the cardplay and having to decide in which of the four ways you're going to use a card. Really liked it!

A fine little euro, but not exception in any measure. Picked this game up because of the multi-use cards, but so few of them are played during the course of the game I never felt the tension of decision making there. There is a huge mishmash of mechanisms but they don't feel smoothly integrated and the game is over before you can get an engine going. It's surprisingly light in the decision space for how many mechanisms are at play. Also there is zero theme and the art is pretty bland. I see no reason to ever play this instead of a slew of other games (Castles of Burgundy for example)

RATING: N/A
I would like to give this a try. It's ridiculous but the player colors are what makes me hesitant. The market just isn't as pretty as the rest of the game and I'm always sad when resources are represented by little cubes/cylinders instead of looking like ACTUAL PIGGIES, but I have really come to enjoy engine-building card games and I think this one has some solo play, so I would love to try it.

Interesting heavy euro. A bit too much happening to make sense of everything the first time around, but on further plays it's more manageable. Works very well with two players too, although the relative power of different cards is much changed from four player games. The many uses of each card together with the timing of receiving them and the way to combo them make each game feel very different. I also like the fact that there are only three places to play cards for their abilities, it makes deciding which to play there even more important. The luck of the dice is mitigated by the fact that all players get to use the same pool of dice, so for me it feels more strategic than Marco Polo for example.

The kind of game where every once in a while you put together a great combo and it keeps you coming back for more.  La Granja isn't a difficult game to learn but you probably won't play it well until after a few plays.  Rahdo captured it perfectly when he described La Granja as the love child of Uwe Rosenberg and Stephen Feld.  It really does feel like they collaborated.

Wow, what a nice surprise. Takes the multiple-use card mechanic from Glory to Rome and uses it as a controlling factor in a very complex, Feldian "point salad" Euro.

The cards absolutely make this game: deciding whether to use them as fields, markets, income/delivery bonuses, or special abilities is excruciatingly difficult, and gives players dozens of different paths to victory in the course of a single game. On top of that, having shared markets on the board, as well as an interesting spacial/area majority mechanic, means there is a lot to think about. Taking all the cards into consideration, there is a ton of replay value here.

An amazing mix of known mechanisms from succesful games (Glory to Rome use of cards, Luna central board, Loyang free resources conversions..). It's well balanced, dynamic and feels like a Feldian game, with resource management ! Surely one of the best games of 2014 in its category.
I did not like that much the big number of phases & sub-phases and the numerous manipulations that slow the game down. It could have been streamlined (useless bonus tiles in the end for example..). I also did not find anything new but it was great fun overall !

RATING: 6
La Granja, with it's really interesting multi-use cards is super close to being something spectacular, but overall I was left feeling like it was simply "good".

One of my friends nailed it when he said it just felt like you weren't working toward a goal.  For the first half of the game, it had that feeling of building up, but then it seemed like the game hit a plateau for the last several turns where you were just repeating a lot of the same things over and over.  Scoring more points for the sake of scoring points rather than really feeling like you were working on something interesting.

I really did enjoy the card play, where you had to decide the best use of every card you drew.  The 4 different ways of playing every card was neat, and I hope to see it applied to more games.  In this case, it just felt like the goal of what you did with that engine was a little uninteresting.

Overall, I still like the game OK, but it's not something that will be suggested often.

P.S. If you've been frightened by Spielworxx previous rule books, they've turned it around with this one!  There is some awkward terminology (such as using the term "flipside up", which is not at all a clear term, instead "face down"), and many of the cards use very unclear wording and confusing terminology, but overall the game was understandable from one read through the rules.  If they had done one more pass from a native English speaker, they would have aced it.

I was glad to have a chance to try this title, since I wasn't able to acquire a copy of my own. The game was pretty good, even though most mechanisms seemed inspired by other, familar games: card placement from Glory to Rome, token displacement from Luna, turn order track from Bora Bora (or probably several Feld titles), dice drafting from ... lots of games, honestly. 

Seperate from the individual mechanics, the gameplay reminded me at times of a less-polished At the Gates of Loyang. Thematically, much of the game is growing crops and delivering them to the market. Dynamically, there is also a lot of head-down fiddling with various commodities in order to eek out an extra dollar here or point there.

I enjoyed playing, and would be happy to keep the game around for a few more sessions. But I was concerned by our final scores, which turned out to be seperated by just a few points despite pursuing quite different strategies: 67, 65, 64, 64. That's disconcertingly close. If it gets another try, hopefully we'll see a little more seperation.

Wonderful Euro game that does not reinvent the wheel but rather feels like a cross between a Rosenberg and a Feld game. Players must harvest goods and transport them to the city market to score points and win the game. The core of the game is comprised of a deck of cards that can be used in 1 of 4 ways to give players special powers, orders to fulfill, fields to grow crops, or farm extensions that give extra income and abilities. The game is not flashy and the theme is not very exciting but the gameplay is excellent and it has quickly become one of my favorite games!

(MASTERPIECE #1 of 10) To date I have played close to 500+ different games; this is my GRAIL game, passing Le Havre for #1 and the only 9.8 in my collection. The game has incredible  depth, balance, fast gameplay and the feel of always having to make meaningful decisions, oh and lest i not forget my favorite mechanic: Dice Drafting.  For me this is a very tight Euro that gets better with each play. The implementation and execution of utilizing all four sides of the game cards is flat out brilliant and the dice drafting has you on edge. It is clear the designer was inspired by the likes of Rosenberg and Feld (Feld's Luna "Promotion Choice" comes to mind and is executed here to perfection). This game is a wonderful testament to the inspiration two Master game designers (Feld/Rosenberg) can have on others, all while retaining its own identity, as stylistically different in a crowded genre. I cannot say enough good things about La Granja. I will never, ever turn down a game. The game also scales well at all player counts. I have purchased extra copies to keep sealed away because one day I will give my son (now 8) a copy to play with his family.  Yes indeed, this game is a  a MASTERPIECE and my number 1.

RATING: 5
At its core, this is a solitaire-ish engine building resource conversion game. The interaction is almost non-existent. The bonus for finishing a market first is 1 VP! That isn't much incentive. There is some competition for the placements on the board, but in practice you are more concerned with maximizing your own efficiencies than worrying about competition on that board. 

This is also a game where the gears are all showing, as it doesn't give you a way to connect - there is nothing that you are trying to accomplish, and there is nothing evocative about the game at all. You are just grinding points, which represent nothing so far as I can tell.

That said, the four possible uses for each card creates some interesting decisions, and the game is fairly simple for giving you a reasonably difficult puzzle to work out. 

This game is right in the current wheelhouse for BGG, so I think most will love it, as it is interesting. But it isn't for me.

RATING: 6.6
I have mix-feeling about La Granja, the game has several features from some of my favorite games: the area-impulse mechanic from Luna,  the multi-placement cards from Glory to Rome and the resource-exchanging dices from numerous dice games, it even has the farm theme which reminds me of Agricola. La Granja combines several classic games' characteristics in a well-balanced manner, fluent gaming progress. Overall, it's a worth-playing strategy game. 

Although, after several plays, I realize a fusion of classic games may not always be a classic game,  contrary to its various game mechanics, the strategy depth seems a little bit unitary. Since the transaction points (donkeys) are limited in the game, the only reasonable way to spend them is using the donkeys to complete market barrows(top side of the card). In 2-4 transactions player can get one commodity(which is a very powerful resource) and 2-6 points with a constantly point from the market area plus points from kicking out other players. 

And what if we want to try different scoring path instead of finish the market barrows? Unless the player has cards  related to the crafting building, they are quite meaningless during the whole game: the player has to spend at least three donkeys to gain the finished point(1)+turn bonus(max 6 at the last turn)+unlock bonus(1, if exist), with a scarcely noticed once per turn benefit. Meanwhile your opponents can spend as many donkeys(or maybe less) to complete the market barrow and gain their control in the central market. 

After few games my friends and I feel really confused about the crafting building thing: why do they even exist? We try different strategies for them, like finishing them earlier so you can get the per-turn benefit or waiting until the last turn to receive mass points, and it seems like the only reasonable way to utilize them is finishing as late as possible to gain the point since the per-turn benefits are not as useful. 

Now on to the cards: the multifunctional cards is an interesting idea and we enjoy patching them around the player mat. But the game also has the general issues of every card-driven game: card randomness. Every card has four different functions but not all of them are equally desirable. Some of the cards I only want to use the specific side of them, and some of the cards I struggle to choose which side of them I want to play, that leads to a little imbalance among all the cards. 

And, that dice-resource thing, am I the only one think it's really abrupt?

As a conclusion, if you are expecting a classic strategy game like Troyes, Puerto Rico, Brass, CoB, etc., you might be a little disappointed of La Granja. But if you just want to play a fluent, smoothing strategy game with a little innovation, La Granja is  not a bad choice. 

Pros:
+ Descent art design 
+ Interesting multifunctional-cards
+ Fluent gaming progress

Cons:
- Cards are a little imbalance
- Strategy depth isn't that amazing.
- The dice-resource thing is really unnecessary

La Granja是個讓我心情相當複雜的策略遊戲, 它擁有一些我最喜愛的遊戲的影子: Luna的區域排擠, Glory to Rome的卡牌機制, 以及骰子換取資源等, 還有讓人想起Agricola的農場經營主題. La Granja巧妙地融合了一些經典遊戲的機制, 卻沒有因顧此失彼而破壞流暢度, 總體而言是個值得一試的策略遊戲.

但問題也在於, 融合了這些經典遊戲的機制後它本身卻無法成為一個經典遊戲, 在看似多元化的行動選擇下, 玩家在遊戲中真正值得發展的策略取向其實不多: 受限於每回合運輸有限的情況下,最有效率的取分方式是完成市場推車契約, 不但可以得到契約上的分數(3-6), 還可能得到排擠對手的分數, 加上回合終了的存活分數, 最重要的是可以得到一個商品貨物-遊戲中運用層面最廣的資源. 

相較之下, "除非玩家有對應的卡牌", 市場版圖上的工匠建築幾乎沒有意義可言, 玩家需要花費至少3以上的運輸步數才能得到1個微乎其微的持續獎勵, 除非玩家在前1-3回合專注運輸於工匠建築, 否則這些獎勵的收益並非真的很值得,因為同時間你的對手已經因為完成市場推車而得到遠高於(完成工匠建築+解鎖建築+完成回合分數)的收益. 談到完成回合分, 越早完成所得到的分數越低這件事情也讓我們不解, 我了解設計者是想要製造一個兩難的決策: 究竟是早完成以取得獎勵, 還是晚點完成讓我多拿點分數, 但實際上並不會很糾結 - 因為持續獎勵並不是這麼吸引人. 幾場下來, 朋友們與我對工匠建築存在意義一直感到非常疑惑.

接著談到卡片, 多元卡片的設計是非常有趣的想法, 擴充在農場四周也非常直觀. 但因為卡片功能不一的緣故, 有些卡片自始至終我都不會使用到他的某一面, 有些卡片四面都讓我非常糾結, 造成些微卡片強弱失衡的缺陷. 我了解這是卡片策略遊戲的通病, 但當玩家數次以些微之差輸給朋友, 原因只是滿手都是用處不大的卡片時, 實在不免讓人感到氣結. 

另外就是那個骰子資源設計, 真的只有我感到突兀且格格不入嗎?

整體而言, 如果你期待的是一款經典策略遊戲, 可能會感到有點失望; 但如果只是想體驗一款清新的農莊經營策略遊戲, La Granja不失為一個好選擇.

優:
+美術風格清新
+有趣的多元卡片設計
+流暢的遊戲過程

缺:
-策略選擇路線有限
-卡片強弱有差異
-骰子突兀且沒必要

Played once so far with two family members.  It ran long for 3 people (2+ hours) though our first plays generally do.
We did not come away super excited about the game.  I was somewhat disappointed in the workers abilities I was seeing, many of which were somewhat confusing and I ended up playing them but not benefitting from their ability.

Hopefully I can convince my family to give this another chance.

Never quite willing to get this for the longest time but it kept coming back to mind. I would watch a run through and end up thinking it just didn't seem like interesting decisions to make in the game. Something finally broke me down and once I got it I really enjoyed it. 

I really like the look of the game, the color palette is beautiful and fits the theme. The theme is great though I am a sucker for the pastoral themes and the standard euro flavors- farming, animal husbandry, trading...all hell and gone from the modern era. Yum. 

The multi-use cards are excellent and create hard decisions as what you choose sacrifices other great options. The player boards have to be fixed to allow for the card sliding to actually work but that isn't hard. Just as important is that there are many paths to choose from and no one is necessary in my experience. It is a great solo experience though I am still playing 2-player solo just to be able to play out more options in a given game.

I take off points (ha!) because of a pet peeve of mine. I can't stand victory points as they feel so artificial and suck the life out of immersion and theme for me. Let me focus on building and growing and selling things. I can do that here but the game deliberately brings VPs to the fore throughout the game and pushes the ostensible theme to the background. This game would rank higher if not for that flaw throughout....it could be a 9 if not higher.

The multi-use cards are very clever.  Reminded me of Bruges in that regard, but with a multi-faceted production engine to score your points.  The dice placement of income phase was a bit similar to the layout in Yspahan, but in La Granja each player selects one die per turn, with all players sharing the single remaining die.  Excellent!

Nice game. I felt a bit overwhelmed by the fact that every card can be used in so many ways; and more importantly, for each way that a card can be used, you need to factor in how that combos with other cards, both played and unplayed. It's a [b]lot[/b] of possibility modeling. Normally that kind of stuff kills a game for me, but this one has a nice charm and flow to it. From my one play, we realized that you can't just do some of everything, and expect to complete the many goals the game gives you. Some of the scoring seems a bit wacky (more points for completing tracks later in the game), but I'll reserve judgment on that for now.

RATING: 5
Overhyped fluff of the kind we (as in 'boardgamers who frequent this website and are not afraid to use it') already have [i]tons[/i] of. Seriously folks, do look at the game from a little distance before handing over the cash in a Pavlovian urge to get this bo because everyone else is getting it, too...

What is awaiting you? A farm which produces goods, which get transformed into slightly more elaborate products, which can be delivered to various buildings or cards... if you have sufficient donkeys at your disposal, that is. Successful deliveries yield extra income tiles, permanent action enhancer tiles, or crates which act as proverbial Swiss army knives in getting low-level stuff (resources, money, etc.). Do this process for 6 rounds, introduce a bit of standard timing balance, and presto: La Granja. Is it a bad game? No, it isn't. It plays smoothly, and the learning curve for what you need to do is short. It might even invite a bit of replaying because of all the 'strategies' you can employ, but really, the strategic depth here is very small. Matters are very linear, and do not allow for much interesting specialisation. So watch what happens when the eagerly awaited reprint hits the shelves: the game will attract a bit of positive attention—of course—and then quietly sink into oblivion. In two years' time, the game will have been largely forgotten.

I'm still debating whether to deduct one point from the rate for the clumsy use of the cards: the game requires you to slide them underneath your strangely cut player board, but the latter lies too flat on a table for cards to get there without a little squirming, thus upsetting all pieces already on there; the cards on the left and on top meet before they can be slid into their designated position; and there are so many icons on the cards that the various locations don't always cover the 'wrong' ones, causing visual confusion; and more.

A very enjoyable game. Whilst the card mechanics are borrowed almost wholesale from Glory to Rome, the decisions are markedly harder as you get to play so few of them. Many people have compared it with Stefan Feld, but it's a little different, there are less ways to score, which makes it feel more like a knife fight. In addition, there are a few too many different competing mechanics to be truly feldy. Not to say it's not great, but there is a difference. I have some minor gripes, but nothing insurmountable. It's got a lot of replay to it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
La Granja combines a "feldian" plethora of possibilities with "rosenberg-esque" tightness in action economy. One one hand, the game is very lenient with players pursuing a chosen strategy (the trade goods for fulfilled orders being the 'lubricant' that enables most maneuvering), on the other hand there are just never enough actions to accomplish all the things you want to do. Strategies are diverse and seem equally strong in most regards, always taking into account that players need to adapt to whatever multi-use cards the game throws at them. Great production, too.

Feels like Castles of Burgundy++

You are trying to come up with a plan but also always be flexible enough to deal with the randomness coming your way. Early game you have too many deliveries and not enough cards and goods, and late game you have the opposite. So many options on what to do and you just kind of have to wing it. I enjoyed it but didn't ADORE it.

What makes this game so interesting are the cards with multi-uses: fulfill orders for the wheelbarrows to take to market (three slots), add plants to your farm (olives, grain, grapes) (unlimited), additional income, hand size, and pig stalls (unlimited, but costs more each addition), and extra bonus actions/abilities (three slots).  On top of the clever use of cards it also uses dice drafting very well.  Turn order is controlled by how well rested your workers are; the higher up on the siesta track, the more points you get and closer you get to being first to take your turn.

Open the envelope, read enclosed note.....
Name two great board games and a kitchen sink. 

The Caverana eater, La Granja aka The Farm.

Caverna 5-7 played? Download Agricola for your mobile device so you can have something to do between downtime. Solo play? Like playing chess with yourself? Do you? 2-3 player game, solitary play, just hours of trying to beat your old score one point at a time. I loathe how the ratings here can be skewed. A game where the masses will not vote due to the high price tag. Caverns is so great the Rosenberg cult wants expansions? If you read between the lines, people have issues with the game, it is like they are afraid to say so. 

I truly think this is The Emperor's new clothes syndrome caused by a review.

I can not imagine what other plumbing they could hang, glue onto it, reminds me of an Orange County Choppers motorcycle build. Gee, any player count over 1, the other players have to get up out of their seat to just see those 48 up turned tiles, you need a lunch room table now just to set this thing up.

Here is an example of two games La Granja and Madeira that far outclass Caverna and will see more game time. For the Floor Priced Caverna at $98.89 you can pick the other two up with some change. 

Note: Second edition La Granja, the first had cards that needed correcting. Also, Madeira is more of a brain burner.

Update: First play of this game was good.  I enjoyed it.  It takes quite a bit of thinking toward the end to make your best moves.  But it seems everybody is thinking about their turn, so there was not a lot of down time.  This game will likely take up to 2 hours to play.

This game is good but the rules are somewhat convoluted and the mechanisms are fiddly.  I do like the multi-card uses in the game but putting them under the player board can be annoying at times.  I also find the victory point tokens to be really annoying - you constantly have to trade in 1 point value tokens for higher values because you are constantly running out of 1 point tokens (in a 4 player game).  Finally, this game really has no theme (you don't sense a farming theme at all).  The market in the middle means nothing really and I didn't see any point in participating in the craft market a whole lot on my first game of La Granja.  It took a few plays before I could really realize the strategy and depth of the game - now with some plays, I am liking this game a lot more.  Overall, La granja is a good farming game.  I haven't decided if I like this, or Field of Arle, better.  I definitely think Fields of Arle has a stronger thematic presence but La Granja is deep in strategy.  Good game!

Initially daunting as there are so many elements to take on board, the game actually boils down to a number of clearly structured micro-decisions, the most fundamental of which is the playing of your cards to one of four possible function types.  The options this opens are the heart of the game strategy, though other elements are all vital.  Rewards patience without being brutal.  Glad I learned it!

This game has everything I love: multi use cards, action die selection, resource production and management, area control and hand management. All the mechanisms mesh together perfectly. The player board is designed so that once you learn the icons/colours (which doesn't take very long) it is easy to remember what you can do in what phase.

Coupled with the fact that on the second day I got it my wife and I played 3 games in a row makes this game a keeper forever!

There are eurogames where some more weight is required to increase the atmosphere and the gaming experience, but there are others where the increase in weight only improves the game a little bit, this is the case here.
You have a card that you can use in some 10 or 11 ways, but you also have a worker placement to do, facilities to upgrade, materials to process, etc. Dozens and dozens of options and you will never know what was really the best option to choose at a given time. To make things worse, planning is hard here because resources came in random supplies. 
It´s nevertheless a good game, but the general feeling is that it could be almost as good, with much less options and mechanics.

Enjoyable, but the game really does not add much to other euros of a similar ilk; that ilk being genus Point Salad, species Benefits To Remember. Tiles and cards that, once obtained, provide benefits for the rest of the game are a central feature of La Granja. A little of that, as in, say, Castles of Burgundy, is OK, but this game almost takes it further than I can handle.

La Granja is an amazing melting pot of game mechanics - multi-use cards, dice drafting, resource management, set collection, area control, engine building, variable turn order, and simultaneous action selection. Everything meshes beautifully, and it still feels very sandboxy due to the huge amount of flexibility you have, as you can buy/sell/convert all of the resources at any time. Very hard to finish a game without looking back and seeing the things you want to do better next time.

RATING: 7.5
Surprisingly heavy farm-based Euro with resource management, card drafting and area control elements. Feels like a mix of Feld and Rosenberg. Helper powers can be powerful but come down to the luck of the draw, and using a dice roll to limit actions each round further contributes to significant luck elements for a heavy bean counter. Enjoyed being able to focus on optimising play to eek out one more VP without having to factor in Agricola's punishment. Enjoyably thinky, but the significant luck element could lead to frustrating games. (May 2016)

Think of a hybrid of Castles of Burgundy (dice action selection, pure point salad) with Rosenburg Harvest elements (upgraded resources conversions, animal breeding, building abilities and combos) and you have La Granja. After a single play I like it better than CoB, Agricola and Caverna. 

One thing I particularly like is that the point allocation is broad enough that you can sort of follow your nose. In Caverna you think, "If I do these 3 things on my turn I'll make 7 points, or if I do these other 3 things instead I'll make 8". The fact that it can take fully five minutes to come to that conclusion can lead me to a sort of, "Oh, who gives a f@#$?" place.

In LG you can play looser and feel it out: "Going after this is maybe 10ish points at most but over there is more like 15ish or even 20ish." You don't have to try to grind out single points because they rain in from everywhere. 

This makes game duration and downtime much less of a problem. 

Highly recommend!

EDIT: And yet, on the third play I found my interest fading. I didn't care who stumbled into more points. In a year of great plenty, when every farmer's storehouse is full, who cares if your neighbor harvests a dozen more olives than you? 

Take your pick: lack of tension mars an otherwise solid design OR point-salad-plenty is not this gamer's cup of tea.

Kind of a multi-player solitaire where you try to put together a bunch of resources and find creative ways to convert them into victory points.  Have you heard of this type of game before?  I bet you have.  Very fiddly and easy to forget steps.  Suffers from the "Oh yeah, I forgot, I should of had one more shipping action because of this...and I forgot to get a resource when I did this..because I have this card with this tile".  I wouldn't say I disliked the game.  It just wasn't all that fun.  But it was challenging, and given the right mood, I'd play it again.

This is definitely a Stefan Feld you Rosenberg crossbreed. The designers said that their inspiration came from these two giant man and born gaming society. It is an absolute correct statement and I absolutely love this game. The card play with various different abilities on each card is wonderful. The farm good production and conversion is a favorite element of mine in board gaming and it works amazingly here. There is even an area control element to the game. An excellent creation and I will be playing it many more times to come. Two thumbs up

A chewy Euro where players are running a farm, producing olives, grain, grapes and pigs, which can be processed into food, win and meat.  Goods are delivered to market.  It's all about points, and there are a myriad of ways to earn those.  Very much a Feldian point salad type game that I'm a little over, but this one is clean, fun to play, and has a deck of four way multi-use cards that sets it apart from the chaff.  I like this one a lot.

La Granja is a collage of euro mechanisms put together into a cohesive whole. At face value, the game can feel like it has nothing unique to offer. Its strength is that it requires players to assemble a combo of card powers that give an edge, and then exploit that edge to more efficiently perform the actions of the game to outscore opponents.

[b][FirstPlayOn9thOct2014][/b] I enjoyed this game a tonne. It hits all my expectations and I love every single thing about it.

It's a mash up of many known mechanics, especially mechanics found in Feld games (Luna, Burgundy) and Glory to Rome. The multi use of cards is really good and always put you in a really though decision. 

The game components and quality is great. There's so many things you want to do but you're only limited by the number of rounds. It's thinky but isn't that heavy. I just love the multitude of stuff going on in every round.

Sadly, this is currently OOP. I'd buy this in a heartbeat once it's available.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
La Granja's merit is that is provides a simple approach to the traditional eurogame sytle and yet it offers some depth and difficult decisions.

Nevertheless if someone happens to have some nice combo on the first card play phase it can provide them with an advantage that I have found hard to keep up with. Maybe some card drafting on the first round could mitigate this.

I'll probably never turn down a game even if it is to confirm/deny what I mentioned before.

Now here is a game.  If I could distill everything great about a Euro into one game this might be it.  The bastard love-child of Stefan Feld and Uwe Rosenberg, La Granja is indeed derivative but at the same time fresh.  It is a treasure of a game for all Feld-fans out there.  I paid more for this game than any other in my collection as it is so hard to find and I wanted it so much, but it was worth every penny.   The game involves producing goods and then fulfilling contracts to a shared market or to your own barrows.  So far so dull.  The interesting bits are the way the cards work, since each card can ‘do’ one of four possible things, and also the way you can use ‘free’ actions with money or special goods to optimise your turn.   Needless to say there are lots of things going on but it is all integrated very well indeed.    It’s a real find, though sadly hard to actually find at a decent price.  Spielworxx continue to impress as a publisher of consistently good games.

Excellent game.  My only concern is that after the first player completes the market stalls there is little incentive for others.  They seem to need something more.. perhaps an influence on the market itself. 

Take 2:

I was wrong with market critique because I was taught the game wrong.  The game does give incentive for other players to ship the market after the first does because it gives VP's in the amount of the round that you finish the market in.  Finding this rule is a game changer.

RATING: 9.5
This game is stellar. To me, it feels something like a combination of Caverna/Agricola and Castles of Burgandy. The farming aspect is interesting, but the real meat is in puzzling out he best combos to help you reach your goal. Competing in the market, aiming for the craft buildings, deciding whether or not to invest in roof tiles, there are just so many interesting and meaningful choices to make. What a treat!

Just the right amount of randomness (the cards) and luck (the dice) with a nice amount of player interaction (the market) and collecting (the barrows and craft houses).  Tough choices every step of the way.  I think I'm in love.  I bought this because it seemed like a cool mix of Agricola and Castles of Burgundy and it really truly is.

Update: After playing a few solo games I am happy to report that La Granja works really well as a solo game.

RATING: 8
2015-07-07 : Forget Caverna, this is Agricola 2.0. It's at the same time more forgiving and more involved than Agricola. The graphics are meh, but the layout and player aid is good with the exception of the meeples on the hexagonal areas on the main board being too close proximity-wise to identical meeples indicating a finished row, causing a bit of confusion when counting vp's each round. A different kind of meeples would sort this out easily. The only thing I'd change in the game is to introduce some sort of card drafting mechanic before the first turn to mitigate against a really bad card draw. 
2016-12-24 : Played it again last night and it was every bit as good as I remember. Multiple ways to get points, even very different ways to build your engine.

RATING: 8
I think this is an excellent Euro game that adds some diversity to my collection. I really enjoy worker placement, but need a change of pace from time to time and La Ganja provides that. At it's heart this is a resource management, order fulfillment game, where timing of your deliveries is very important. In it's entirety, there's sufficient complexity, however, the rounds are very structured, so at any given step in a phase your options are focused, I certainly like the multi-use cards and after a couple of plays think it's important to get a couple of fields and farm extensions early unless you can get one of the helpers that enables you to move harvest goods from fields to any den.

Overall, an enjoyable, breezy type of game that I would play most any time

La Granja is a crunchy game that mashes the area control mechanism of Luna, farming aspects of Agricola, multi-use cards, and dice drafting. The cards can be used in one of 4 ways: contracts to fulfill (called market barrows) which give points and allow you to take part in the area control, fields which grow specific goods, a special ability which breaks or alters the rules of the game, and a side which provides various possible benefits (ie extra pig storage, larger hand limit, and coins during your income) with this option having an additional growing cost. The dice drafting offers various benefits (money, resources, resource conversion, deliveries, advancement on the turn order track, etc), but I view it as more of a variable income phase.

The game focuses on resource acquisition, conversion, and management. The resources can be sold for money (which has various uses) and delivered to your contracts or to the central board. The game really limits the deliveries you can make over the course of the play. So, you have to make the most of your deliveries. 

It's very crunchy because there are many ways to achieve the same objective. Doing so the most efficiently is the crux of the game. As an example, lets say I want Grain. Well, if I have a card that has a grain field, I can play that and it will produce grain regularly. Alternatively, I might be able to choose this resource during the income phase or choose money during the income phase and buy it. Maybe, I'll sell a different resource I have an abundance of to just straight out buy it. The roof tiles that you can buy at the beginning of the round may allow me to choose a resource of my choice.

Many people praise the multi-use cards in this game and believe it has huge replay value. My current opinion is that the most interesting part of these cards are the special abilities. While fun, you won't get to play many as special abilities over the course of the game due to needing to play cards as contracts, fields, and farm extensions occasionally. This bothers me a little and may have to do more with my own expectations rather than it being a fault of the game. The big issue for me is that I find the game feels like it plays out similarly. This has to do with the fact that players typically play markets early due to the vp/round incentive, whereas delivering to craft buildings late is good because they give bonus points equal to the round they are complete. So, often I find it follows the same narrative arc. I know this will not be a problem for some people, but that's a few preliminary thoughts. Some people have mentioned the randomness of the cards can give some players amazing combos while the rest just plod along, knowing they have no chance at beating the combo. I haven't experienced it in 2 games, but I'm sure it's possible.

This is going to be an excellent game for many people who like crunchy euros. While it's alright, there are a lot of euros I prefer.

RATING: 9
This game keeps getting better every time I play it. Love that every game is different, depending on many factors (what cards you get, which craft buildings are off limits...). Multipurpose cards are great.

The only negative thing I find in this game is the somewhat point salad -system. We often find ourselves pondering, if we have taken all the victory points we should have. There are cases when you get points from about 4 different places for one action. I think the Victory Point -side of the player aids could have done a better job.

But still a great game, which works with every player count (excluding AP prone players!).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
This game has multiple bad flaws to it. The cards have no balance. Some are just better then others. There is no real way to manipulate what cards you get. 

In the mid/end game it devolves into a war game for control of market spaces. How and why this makes any sense I don't know. But the result is it is like any other multiplayer war game. 

The use of the cards for multiple different things is interesting, but in the end because only the market side is super important, it's not necessary and just gimmicky. 

The open market area doesn't work very well. I guess it's just a clearing house for extra supplies and actions, but the rewards are so bad, they aren't really worth going for until the end of the game. Again, they aren't balanced either.

We discussed in length if there would be any ways to make this enjoyable. We couldn't come up with any reasonable ways to address the many many flaws. The game should be scrapped and never should have been printed.

I suspect this is a love it or hate it game for being a Frankenstein of mechanisms. It works for me just fine though. 

The main attraction is using cards in a Glory to Rome-like way. You tuck them up/down/left/right on your player board and what is revealed is how the card is being used. They can be a power, a good, income, or a wagon delivery for you to make later this turn. Each turn you get some new cards and will be able to play more to your tableau. Building your suite of special powers is fun, especially for me as I’m partial to combo-building games. 

Then there’s a dice drafting mechanism whereby you can take actions to pursue your particular strategy for delivering your produced goods. There are special places on the board (that reward the first player in) or you can deliver to any wagons you have, and there are pros and cons to each. At the end of the round, there’s a market stall placement phase where you bump or get bumped and score VPs. 

All in all, the fun of the game is in tying together the way you’ve chosen to use cards with your drafted actions to score points for deliveries as well as placement of market stalls (while hopefully bumping others). It’s very tight with little room for missteps but you come out of it feeling that you’ve executed your own particular strategy compared to everyone else. In that way, it’s a very satisfying, albeit grindy, play.

Total point salad, with lots of flexibility on actions.  Lots of pieces to fit together but once you understand it it flows nicely without a lot of conflict other than some opportunities for screwage in the central market.  Three of us took dissimilar approaches and all finished within five points of each other.  So... yeah, point salad.

A tight resource allocation/ economic game driven by a clever use of multi-functioning cards and dice for some randomized action selection each round. The market board adds some healthy tension to the game as players race to deliver goods for bonuses or jockey setting up market stalls for end-of-round scoring. It's neat how the generic goods token can represent so many different things depending on where it is located on the game boards.

Jó kis kombozós játék. Meglepő módon eléggé kártyaközpontú, holott a kártyák szinte elvesznek a rengeteg egyéb vacak között.

Egy-két negatívum is volt azért: az ikonográfia néhol eléggé félrecsúszott, a kártyák szövegezése se mindenhol egyértelmű, nomeg kicsi összefércelt játék, ami sok-sok más játékból merített ötleteket.

Feld meets Rosenberg. It has the somewhat disparate game parts, the "point salad" ideology and some very literal references (like the Luna scoring on the market or the turn order track) from the former, and the "supply chain management" and added variability through cards from the latter. The result is a combination of very familiar mechanisms with the multi-use cards at its center (which is notable primarily for the usability design of the player boards, not so much any gameplay effects).

Overall, the game feels closer to a Feldian creation than a Rosenberg, with a few subgames that only have a precariously weak thematic connection. On the whole, it is a little too much of a Frankenstein, a haphazard collection of loosely related mechanisms, with too little individual character to be truly enjoyable.

 Prinzip Frankenstein: ein Spiel, das viele Spiele verflickt und vernäht. LA GRANJA macht keinen Hehl aus der Spielmechanismensammlung als Selbstbedienungsladen. Es startet erst gar nicht den Versuch, innovativ zu sein und ehrt stattdessen offen seine Vorbilder, die es in guter Absicht erkennen lässt. Bei aller Wiederholung und kleineren, verzeihbaren Fizzeligkeiten strahlt LA GRANJA den unbekümmerten, sonnigen Charme eines seiner Zitate bewussten Erstlingswerks. Es läuft flüssig, führt anfänglichen Mangel in Mühlräder, die schnell in Gang kommen. Die variable Startkartenbedingung lädt stets zu neuen Wegen durch die Pinien ein. LA GRANJA ist der kleine, schöne Urlaubsort im Süden, der zu unaufgeregt ist, um in einem Hochglanzprospekt zu landen. Genau der richtige Reisespielort für mich!

Another new flashy game design with some dice allocation and some role selection and agonizing decisions. it's not exactly complicated, but the choices you make build on choices you intend to make later, so you need to stick to your guns and have some kind of plan to have a hope at being competitive. It's euro thinky fun. It feels like glory to Rome x Agricola in some ways. Considering how little I have enjoyed Agricola, it is quite a feat to make me enjoy this one as much as I did.

La Granja comes together quite well!  Very much a Euro and really doesn't introduce anything new into the genre, but a tight game nonetheless and all the parts come together very well.  Of course, the card play is what really drives the game and makes things interesting.  Definitely replayable because of this aspect.  Standard resource trading and upgrading, but all interwoven in a way that makes the game feel unified, even if it's a Frankenstein game of popular Euro mechanics.  The author even gives credit to the games that inspired La Granja!  This is primarily a Stefan Feld-inspired game, but the designers do a nice job of honouring his ideas about Euro gaming while putting in the "Glory to Rome" card-play mechanic, which is great, and allows all us lightweights the chance to avoid playing Glory to Rome to get it. :)

Thankfully this game is much better than it looks because, man, this is an ugly game.  Please designers/publishers: stop making games with this washed out pastel art, especially farm games.  That being said this is a worker placement game with a great point salad; there are always good/interesting actions to take and there are a lot of workable strategies.  The card abilities are strong but not so strong that I feel bad using the cards for their other functions.  Cards that do multiple things is usually a nonstarter for me, but because this is not the only/main mechanic in the game and because it's well balanced it works here. Only other negative is the completely useless player aid.  Words, please, not hieroglyphics.

RATING: 7.5
Initial rating. Point salad Euro, with compact play time for it's weight, and having very little theme. Design seems ambitious with cards having 4 different uses, but it works fine because the balance seems reasonable. Other than that, though, this is a pretty standard set of mechanics with drafting, resource management, and contract fulfillment. There is an engine building aspect also, where some choices give persistent benefits vs others that are plays for points. Good balance IMO of strategy vs tactics. Moderate interaction for a Euro. There's the usual race to get things done, but also a specific mechanic when fulfilling a contract that allows you to displace lessor contracts (rated rather abstractly from 1-6) and displaced contracts no longer earn a small bonus from turn to turn.

Will re-rate assuming more plays. Game not widely available as of June '15

Sept 15, bumped rating up slightly. Has a ton of replay, but am finding it a bit fiddly.

"Too easy to get the resources you need, when you need it. Many upgrade options, or just pay cash. Dice selection for revenue usually always gives you what you want since you get five dice to put on six slots. Very telling that there wasn't one time during our die selection phase where I thought "oh no, she took the die I really wanted!" There was never any tension. Very gentle, very forgiving, solitary experience with little interaction, except for the market square where you push out other workers. Makes zero thematic sense."

I will add that it runs long for what it is...

RATING: 8.5
Wonderful mix of Luna area control, Glory to Rome multi-use cards, dice action selection from Yspahan, etc.  Great integrity to admit the influences for this game.  La Granja is its own game and mixes these influenced mechanisms together in a unique way and integrates the theme nicely.  The muted yellows aren't the prettiest art but give this game its own look and feel.  Fun decisions and lots of ways to score and play.  Not super quick or long, definitely fun for the time it takes.  Great game as others have said for a year.  Thanks to Stronghold for bringing this to the masses and for another great production, sans the insert.

Cinghialone bello setoloso messo insieme con meccaniche non certo innovative: prendi l'ambientazione e le carte di Agricola, un pizzico di gestione dadi (messo lì abbastanza a caso e con esiti non proprio riusciti), l'isola centrale di Luna e mischi il tutto. 
Il risultato è buono, ma non fa certo gridare al miracolo. 
La sensazione della coperta corta si avverte in ogni fase di gioco ed è essenziale crearsi un buon motore per le risorse il prima possibile, al fine di spedire più carretti.

Normally, I would score a game like this higher. But when I weigh the overwrought nature of the phase order (and the multitude of steps for each) with the fiddliness, the pleasure from the gameplay is just lacking. Secondly, this is another game that has players begin with a very stingy economy and add to that the fact that you'll only have perhaps a few chances in the game to tuck cards, you barely feel as if you've got your engine up and running by maybe the 5th round. Finally, there are some helpers in the game that can make victory a fait accompli if a player gets one and can make use of it from an early round. That luck of the draw is fine in a smaller game but not one as complex as La Granja.

I did, however, like the multi-use cards and the way they tuck; this makes for a great deal of replayability and a good reason to explore new strategies. The Center Market is cool but not as good as Luna, the Revenue Dice are cool too but not as good as Castles of Burgundy, and the Siesta Track is fine but I've seen it done in half a dozen Feld games already. 

In short, I'd just rather play a Feld game or a Chudyk game than play La Granja.

Good game, but it does not really convince me like "Die Burgen von Burgund" for example. Although one has a lot of options and the mechanism to play cards in four different ways is quite cool, the things you finally do are very similar in each game. For a even a better rating the game would need a little more divergence in game play.

Opinion: I still have doubts about it. I have enjoyed all plays I had, and found it a lovely one, but anytime I think about it and see that it is a mix of many mechanics, start thinking about.
The game works like a clockwork, the idea of using the cards for different purposes is something I love. The dice like Yspahan is better in this one.
In the end, I like the game, still had those doubts, but I see the game working perfect, and enjoying any play I do, therefore nothing to complain about

This is a game that takes from many sources, most notably - from my limited experience: Castles of Burgundy - therefore there are a lot of moving parts. 

Do these integrate well together? I would say yes. The card mechanic is ergonomically ingenous and there are many avenues to explore. 

That said, this is what I would call a medium-high heavy euro, the explanation is complex while the actual game is pretty clean and straightforward if you know the ropes. Expect at least one game to get to know those ropes, and remember that the donkeys are key. :)

RATING: 9.1
Wonderful, thinky, mix of hand management, area control with a bit of worker placement and surprisingly variable player power make for a unique euro-style game. Nice clean art with a very Castle of Burgundy feel. The most interesting mechanic of the game is the cards which can be used for 4 different functions around the farm, giving a vast number of possibilities with just the 3 card starting hand. Only neutral/negative is the game could get pretty bogged down in AP and some of the cards worker powers can be pretty nasty.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Cards are cool, but not much you can do if you end up with a hand full of similar unhelpful cards.  Area control is tense, but unthematic.  Dice are fine since they determine choices rather than outcomes.  The first game was pretty satisfying, except for I got stuck with a lot of upgrade ability at the end- it turns out that upgraded items are worth much less than the base items and are less versatile.  Not sure why upgrade becomes a dead action at the end when clearly effort was made to make every other action useful at the end.  Lastly, I really don't like hidden trackable victory points.  It isn't my game, but if it was, I might insist upon a score track.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
La Granja is the perfect Euro for me. It features my number one favorite mechanism in board gaming, multi-use cards, very prominently. Engine-building opportunities abound, and I never feel like I'm on rails; there's always a unique combination of opportunities to score in every game. It's also never a four-player solitaire game; there's enough player interaction in the dice-drafting, siesta track, and market competition to insure that never happens.

This is really a top-notch game that avoids both feeling railroaded into a strategy or set of actions (looking at you, Agricola) or avoiding any player interaction and feeling like multi-player solitaire (e.g., Castles of Burgundy). You almost always have something useful to do and, at the same time, the game rewards careful planning and strategy. Very nice design and pacing.

The description of "Feld meets Rosenberg" fits pretty well. This game reminds me of Luna, Agricola, Glory to Rome and Yspahan. Still a nice game, but yeah, it feels like a collection of different mechanics that don't have much to do with eah other, specially the "roof" stuff felt totally misplaced.

It's a bit too much for my taste and I doubt that the game needs all those mechanics to be good, but well...

I am a Eurogamer, but this game was just painful! 

Unclear cards and unclear rules (6 pages of rules questions on BGG!)
Fiddly as hell
Waaay too many mechanisms in play
Downtime off the chart
Waaayyy to long! (took us over 3 hours)
Connection to theme is negative, it's counterthematic!

The game in my opinion need to be cleaned up in so many ways, it's for me unbelivible that it has been released in this condition. This game is the opposite of streamlined, and  not a finished product!

However, I do like the use of the cards (putting underneath the board on the diffrent sides). Very cool, and clever. 

Glad to have played it, so that I know what it is, but would never like to play it again.

As of September 2015 the best game I purchased this year. I really like it. I like the tactical dice mechanism mixed with the strategic card play which makes it not *that* heavy. Plays equally well with 1-4 players. Some mechanism could be more thematic, but it's not the focus of the game ;) – I like the sandboxy feeling of having ressources to convert (Le Havre style) and take different steps each round to get points. Some of the helpers have not 100% clear rules, this is why it's not a 9.

Also: cubes/hexagon wooden pieces > clumsy printed chits. I like 'em :)

La Granja features a successful combination of several other Euro mechanics, in a slightly fiddly, but thematic Farm building engine.

Players grow crops, raise pigs, fulfill small market contracts, supply Craft sellers, and take naps/siestas on Majorca.

Goods go to market using Donkeys, which limit players' sales/VP conversion opportunities.

Different stalls in the market are better for placement, and these dislodge lower places- and of course staying in the market longer is another way to earn VPs- this lifts the Temple placement effect from Luna.

But much of a player's focus may be on the Farm cards, because these offer an opportunity to add (a) to the Farm fields, (b) to the Farms' income/pig stalls/access to Donkeys/Farm card hand limits, (c) Market contracts, or (d) Farm helpers with special powers, and these last help to make efficient engines that bring in VP's over the 6 rounds.

These cards add most of the luck, and the best opportunities to improve the farming engine- that's both good from a flavour/engine perspective, but also less good from a luck factor.

A point salad game with lots of small working pieces, the play can be a bit fiddly to work smoothly, but overall La Granja offers a somewhat interactive Euro farming game with a lot of options and without artificially added penalties. 

Working your farm less well will simply see someone else win who does find/create a more efficient engine- there are ways to limit other players, but too many detours to block options will simply find better players finding different paths to beat you, as you fail to build your own farm.

Deep game with lots of good card plays.  Will need to play it at least a few more times to really get the hang of it and which strategies I like.  I feel like it's going to be similar to Agricola in the way that the game will play roughly the same each time, but the cards you're dealt will determine which route you go.  Overall I really enjoyed our first play through even though I came in dead last.  :P

Very good points salad. Don't underestimate Income early or farms!! Both are essential to get going quickly, and lots of pig pens do well for you too.

Next time I'd like to try aiming for a few low value barrows early to sort of slum rush the trade good bonus.

Keep pace with the roof building or give up on it, the tiles get slightly worse as the game goes on, but the points cost goes up so unless you keep pace (thus ensuring your points payout increases) then you are better off cutting your losses.

Egy összetett stratégiai játékban a pontszerzésnek általában több féle módja van, a játékosok más és más utat választva juthatnak el a győzelemig, így van ez a La Granjában is, már csak azért is, mert a játék egy hibrid, amely számos korábbi sikeres játékból vett át mechanizmusokat (pld. Luna, Dicsőség Rómának), amelyeket sikeresen ötvözött. A játék legérdekesebb, és a játék mechanikája szempontjából legfontosabb része a játékban található 66 kártya. 
A Dicsőség Rómában című játékban találkoztam azzal a mechanizmussal, hogy egy kártyának többféle felhasználási módja van. Így van ez a La Granjában is, és az, hogy a 4 fajta lehetőség közül melyik használható, attól függ, hogy a kártyát a táblánk melyik oldalára játsszuk ki. 

A játék elején kapunk egy kereskedelmi árucikket, hogy könnyebben tudjunk elindulni, a játék közben pedig sikeres talicskázások után kapunk ismét árucikket. Az árucikkeket választásunk szerint tudjuk átváltani 4 ezüstre, vagy 2 különböző terményre, húzhatunk vagy kijátszhatunk 1 kártyát, esetleg kaphatunk 1 malacot, vagy 2 terményünket ingyen fejleszthetjük termékké, a búzából és az olivabogyóból étel, a szőlőből bor, a malacból hús lesz. Maga a játék fix hat körből áll és minden körben négy fázis van.
A Farm fázisban a legfontosabb akcióval kezdünk a kártyák kijátszásával. Ezt követően megkapjuk a bevételünket, ami lehet ezüst a farmbővítés által, árucikk , termény vagy ezüst a piacon megszerzett kék tokeneknek megfelelően. Utána az üres mezők „teremnek” egy-egy jelzőt amit a jelző ráhelyezésével jelzünk, és ha van két malacunk és van hely az ólban, akkor kapunk egy új malacot is. A negyedik akció a tető token vásárlása. Minden tető ad valamit a játékosnak, aki ezt megvásárolja (pld. malac, termények, szállítás, fejlesztés, pénz stb.) és az újabb tokenek több pontot is hoznak. 
A bevételi fázisban kezdőjátékos dob a játékosok számának megfelelő kockával (2 főnél 5, 3 főnél 7, 4 főnél 9 kockával). Minden játékos sorba elvesz kockákat, míg mindenkinél 2-2 kocka nem lesz. A kocka értékének megfelelően kapunk bevételt. 
A szállítási fázisban a megkapott szamár tokenek segítségével szállítunk. A szállítás irányulhat a talicskánkra vagy a fő táblára, a piac körüli kézműves házakba. Ha talicskára szállítunk, akkor azokra a kártyákra tudunk árukat tenni, amelyek a táblánk tetejére tettünk. Ha tele van a talicska, akkor kapunk érte egy árucikket, illetve megkapjuk érte a kártyán feltüntetett győzelmi pontokat (2-6) és az egyik jelzőnket a fő tábla megfelelő értékű hexájára kell tenni a piacon. Ha szomszéd piacon van alacsonyabb értékű helyen más játékosnak jelzője, az bizony le fog kerülni a tábláról, ami azért rossz neki, mert ezek minden körben pontokat hoznak. A hexák úgy vannak elhelyezve és számozva, hogy ez az egymás kiszorítósdi rész nem hagyható ki. Én nem szeretem ezt az egymással kiszúrós mechanizmust egy gazdálkodós játékban, de itt ez kikerülhetetlen a piac felépítése miatt.
A pontozási fázisban minden a piacon lévő jelző és a szieszta sávon elfoglalt helyünk szerint kapunk pontokat. A játéknak a 6. kör után van vége. 

Kedvenc játékszerzőim Uwe Rosenberg és Stefan Feld hatásai látszanak a játékban, nem véletlenül van külön köszönetnyilvánítás feléjük a játékszabály végén. Aki szereti az összetett, gazdasági témájú, európai típusú társasjátékokat, annak mindenképpen érdemes kipróbálnia.

But overall, I thought the game was balanced, it gave you quites a few point scoring options (Sort of felt like a Feld game), had very nice artwork, and definitely kept me engaged.

I really wanted to like this much more than I did; I think it was mostly my mood and not the game that was at fault.  The cards were used in a way that reminded me of Glory to Rome--they have a different meaning based on how you position them on the board. But it has an interesting resource-management aspect that GtR doesn't have, which involves building up your farm and getting things to work together.  (1 play)

La Granja just immediately clicked with me. I was immensely surprised at how well this very Euro-style game engaged and enthralled me without having another person manipulating the game so I had something to contest against. 
The card-play is phenomenal and makes me wish I could try Glory to Rome. The quick and simple AI gives a perfect amount of tension each game; and the special abilities on every card presents so many exciting combinations that I can't wait for the follow match to see what combos will come up. Moreover, the depth of game-play versus play-time is incredible. Using the one game piece to represent a plethora of resources is just ingeniously efficient; and the variety of avenues in which to pursue points seems well-balanced. 
The only detractor for me is the dice mechanic. While I recognize its brilliance, I can't help but feel that the randomness of the cards is enough, and the dice only adds some frustration when what is rolled is legitimately useless and wasted. 
After the first 5 plays I couldn't ignore the fact that it belongs in the highest ranks of my solo games, and I don't see it going anywhere anytime soon. 

[b]Pros:[/b] 

- The depth of game-play versus play-time

A game that initially intrigued and impressed us all.  The game seems to have loads of options and depth... however after 5 or 6 plays (not all of them with me) we quickly discovered that for all of the multitude of options, the game is actually very binary and not terribly interesting. Sure there are lots of little ways to spice up your board, but in the end you are usually trying to accomplish the exact same thing every game in a very similar way.  Also for the record - the Wainwright is broken in our opinion.

The multi-functionality of the cards attempts to minimize the variance, but they still affect your win percentage more than I'd prefer.

RATING: 6
It's surely a solid design but not for me.
Too long, too tedious and too solitaire for my taste.  The solitaire feeling comes from the fact you don’t follow what other players exactly do because of the complexity of the game and you have enough on your own plate.

Too much freedom - which in theory is a good thing and helps the replayability - doesn't convince me here either.

really enjoyed it, takes the full length printed on the box, but never feels too crunchy or like you're dying from downtime. lots of small, interesting choices - 100% would play again when time allows. 

one of the better Euros on the market, and a nice option instead of Agricola if you want the theme without the intense pressure.

RATING: 7
I don't have too much to say about this one, its more Euro Goodness mostly, nothing new but puts together a bunch of things fairly well. The main mechanic driving the game is filling contracts, through gathering resources etc, and it does come out feeling mostly Feldian due to being a huge point salad.  

Even though I was left with the feeling to play again to improve on how I did, I could not shake the feeling my next game would play out very similar. The main board it seems will play out mostly the same, game to game for all players, so the main variability comes from the cards, and potential abilities you might play them for. Not sure how many cards there are, I think quite a few but if you are only playing 2 or 3 abilities I'm still leery of the games legs, and even though there seems to be multiple paths again I'm not sure how different those really play out. There are some abilities that can change how you play somewhat, so this will definitely help I'm just not sure its enough is all, and maybe a little more specialization encouraged would have helped. Maybe I've just played too many Euros...

At any rate note these comments are only after one game and just my initial impressions. It would seem from what my GB John Brier is saying that we sort of came away with the same take here, and as he notes yes interaction is quite low

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A chimera of Euro mechanics found in other games (Glory to Rome, Luna, Yspahan). However La Granja is quite dry since the mechanics are very disjointed with its other mechanics and you feel like you're playing several mini games at once. The game feels very Feld-ish so I can appreciate the design.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Multi use cards are fun, I liked that the barrels did a lot of different powerful things, and the power tiles you got from the static markets were cool and powerful. but it seemed like turn order mattered very little, which made the donkey tile choice really uninteresting, I don't think anyone in my game even considered the one that was 3 hats and only one donkey, and so that seemed kind of like a wasted mechanic. Also the fact that the actions available in the action selection portion of the game were randomly determined really bothered me. It seemed like the dice clumped up a lot which made for a much less interesting choice of actions to take. Still overall a really fun game.

Update: Playing it again knowing how the dice are sort of weird it was easier and felt more reasonable when I thought of them less as a main part of the game that would actively forward my plans and more of a bonus thing that might make things easier. I still don't think turn order matters much or at all, and actually there were times I was happy to go last for market stall knocking out purposes. So really strong game, but one that I think could be slightly stronger with a few tweaks (mostly the donkey/hat tiles still seem superfluous).

RATING: 7
La Granja is an enjoyable Euro filled with tense moments, especially toward the end of the game as the need to optimize resources becomes vital. The competition for market spaces in the center of the board should satisfy those who prefer a bit more direct interaction in a Euro while the cards (with their multiple uses including special abilities) provide a bit of variety. My only complaint is the game feels a bit lighter than it should be thanks to the randomness of the card draws (sometimes great ability combos show up in early draws) and the randomness of the dice rolls during the dice drafting phase (which make some long-term planning difficult). Still, it's a satisfying challenge from a solid Euro.

It's a solid resource management game with cards that can be played in one of four ways. So, you know, there's that whole "wanting to do everything" thing going on.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (September 2015)

I have heard many great thing about La Granja, so I was very excited to try it. My first game was only a two player game and it wasn’t as fun as I thought it would be (so I was disappointed), but I have played the game two other times with 4 players and my appreciation for the game continues to grow. I think it is best with 4 players because the market becomes very important and you see much more action dice, that is, there is much more player interaction this way.

La Granja has (somewhat) easy rules, but they are many so explaining the game isn’t that easy/quick, however La Granja has a great graphic design that helps a lot during the game explanation and during gameplay. Each phase is color coded and the cards and aids maintain this code so the game flows quickly. The player´s  boards are great (in function and design) and the art is also very good.

I love games in which cards serve different purposes and La Granja features this mechanism in spades. Each card can be used in four different (and excluding) ways, so each game will be different. There is some luck with the cards, but I think it can be mitigated by skillful plays, so it doesn’t bothers me. Another source of luck are the dice action, but I feel it can be mitigated as well so La Granja is a game of skill. Every decision counts, and it has many interesting decisions, you have lots of options in each phase (which card to play, where to play it, which dice to pick, how many deliveries to do, how much rest you should get, where to deliver.), I love it. After seeing how many options do you have in each turn, I would have expected the game to be slow, but La Granja moves at a fast pace.

It really seems La Granja is a mixture of Rosenberg´s and Feld´s ideas.

I don’t have anything bad to say about the game, if pressed I would go for the theme, but it is a very minor quibble for me. I dislike farming themes, but as the game is so good I don’t particularly care about the theme. However I can say that the theme and the game mechanisms are in synch, which is always welcomed. The glossary could explain a bit better the cards, but again, this is very minor issue for me.

Bottom line, La Granja is a solid game that has a permanent spot in my game collection. I want to play it again soon. I’m impressed by it.

Very Feldian. Lots of things, tight game, needs forethought and planning. I like it. Some things about it bother me, that could have been better, and that's what makes it not a Feld game. 

1.) You get variable points for certain actions, unlike a Feld game there are no reminders of this on the board or player aids.

2.) The luck mitigation is low, and not always possible.

3.) Several times I was confused by how something should work. Clarity in the rules and components is not equivalent to a Feld game. 

Feld's games have a smoothness and elegance to them. A lot of folks overlook this, cause it's hidden UI, and not in the chrome. But the game gets out of the way and let's you play, this game while good, is not as polished as the standard Feld fare.

Overall, it's a game I'm glad to have, and will get better with more plays and comfort with the ruleset.

2016-08-08 - La Granja is a pretty heavy dice drafting/multi-use card game. There's a lot to keep track of (special abilities that trigger actions when other actions occur), but I wouldn't call it fiddly. The strategies and decisions are interesting. If you like some of the heavier Felds, you should check this one out.

2016-09-01 - I'm upping my rating to a 7.5. I really like this game. I could definitely see it going up even more eventually, but I will wait and see how its longevity is.

Preliminary rating. This seems like an excellent game. My wife already says she prefers it to both Agricola and Fields of Arle, but I am not that sold on it yet. 

I quite enjoy how the game has pretty focused scoring opportunities (2 main ways to earn points) but still has a lot of flexibility in how you actually get to those scoring opportunities. The 2 player game is good, but I did not particularly love the solitaire game. 

This is very good at all player counts (except solitaire). This game definitely deserves the praise it has been receiving!

A very fun mix of several games, one of which happens to be Luna (one of my favorite games). Lots of choices around how to use cards and how to build up your player board. It was a lot of fun to play but I am worried about player interaction being too limited. You can boot people in the Luna portion of the game and you can race people to some bonus points by being the first to make certain deliveries, so there is interaction, but it's too early for me to judge if I'm satisfied with that aspect of the game.

RATING: 7
Positively speaking, La Granja is an homage to the authors’ favorite game designers and games. Negatively speaking, it’s a soulless Frankenstein monster. The clearest citations are Feld and Rosenberg with their works Agricola, Loyang, Castles of Burgundy and Luna (which the designers openly admit). Building up a finca and learning professions (Agricola), harvesting and delivering to customers (Loyang), selecting actions determined by dice (Castles of Burgundy) and establishing stands at a central market (Luna’s temple district) are those elements. If you take away everything from La Granja which is present in a comparable form in any of these four titles, it’s likely that there will be nothing left.

The mechanisms are cleverly combined to pose a challenge sufficiently different from its inspirations to justify its existence. The game experience is somewhere between Agricola’s challenge to accomplish anything and Burgundy’s quest for incremental efficiencies. In the end, its spirit is closer to the latter’s more tactical optimization exercise than Agricola’s constant uphill battle. La Granja is more mechanical and therefore more geared toward gamers than any other of these titles with the possible exception of Luna.

For fans of the titles that inspired La Granja, the game is a nice diversion. Anybody else is probably better served with either of the inspirations.

A bit fiddly and not as smooth-playing as I hoped it would be. There are definitely some thematic things that leave me scratching my head (like why can't I harvest fields into my dens?).

Disappointment! I was supremely interested in the multi-use cards, the races for buildings, the dice-action selection. In the end, the multi-use cards are mostly all the same, except for the helper, of which you can use only 3, and which are rarely the most useful use for the cards, and the overall game is a patchwork of multiple, unrelated mini-games.

I enjoyed the mishmash of euro mechanics and played a few times. The card are ultimately the real creative aspect of this game. You can really get some very cool combinations to improve your results. But I'm just not sure if I've become discouraged by the whole euro game trend. I'm not compelled to play this one. My other games have more interaction. I must say i strictly play this game as a 2 player game. In this configuration the interaction can seem unoriginal and typical of euro game design.

I like almost everything about the several ways you can lay cards around your estate.  And I like the tried-and-true dice claiming mechanism.

2017-12-09 - 6 - A proper working eurogame with existing theme, but almost none interaction. It can be quite pleasant to play, but it's nothing spectacular and suffers from "I don't really care what others do" like many eurogames nowadays. Some mechanisms needlessly overcomplicate the game, like roofs and token from the shops.
The artwork is rather dull, but I've seen much worse.

Fun and interesting game.  I like the multiple uses for the cards, generating income and goods, and the use of the dice in the game.  A game where one needs to play once or twice to get a feel for the gameplay and scoring opportunities.  Artwork and components are very bland; it seemed sort of unfinished to me.  Rated between a 7 and an 8 for now.  Good game but not good enough to pay inflated prices should I decide to add it to my collection.  I could definitely wait until it's in wider release and reasonably priced.

La granja is a resource conversion game. The trick is that only transporting allows you to get points. And when explaining the game I would stress on that.


The 4 uses card and the tokens are on which the tokens are placed works really well.
There is no need for seperate tokens allthough it would add some more theme to it.
It would also slow the game down...

This is compared to feld but I would only use that if you like his games.
I am not fond of his games and if this was a feld than this would be my favourite feld.
I am just saying that if you don't like feld games this shouldn't stop you.

What is easily forgotten is that at any time during your turn you can do four possible actions.

I should have scored two more since In the last turn I had to pick a one and didn't do anything with it.
And than In the mutual round again.
My 3 pig places were full.
However I could have sold a pig for three money and than take the new pig twice.
Since I had only 14 money at the end of the game is scored two points.
But i should have had 20.

Below a run dwn of our game.
We had no idea when we played it for the first time with three what the optimal moves were.
I scored 56, Alain scored 52 and Gust 48

i made a grand total of 7 deliveries in the last turn. The only turn except the second turn that I wasn t start player.
8 from doing the three pig deliveries, and 5+1+1 and  2+1  from my marketstands. In end scoring another 2 from those as well.  I allready had two goods in these stands from my extra deliveries from the fifth round.

Now the game was strange at one point Gust was leader. Alain overtook midway through When we went in the final round. Alain had 43, Gust 39 and I had 34.

Gust ran out of steam having played the big delivery cards in the fourth and fifth round.
Alain had no marketstands amymore from his own to deliver too.
And i played the three deliveries in the fifth round so I could knock of players with my five marketstand in the final round. 
the bonus granted by the markets in the middle of the board was taken by Gust and to a lesser degree by Alain.
I was focussing on my own stands. Luckily I finished the extra delivery bonus in round and since deliveries are the only way to score points that is really important.

+ Glory to Rome style multi-use cards with nice bonuses
+ doesn't feel like another Agricola because it is much easier to do what you want and you don't have to do a little of everything.
+ seems like there is good replay value.

+/- rulebook was very thorough with lots of figures but I felt that the important parts could have been highlighted a little more

- I wish there was a little bit of art on cards as well (I love the cover art btw)
- pushing cards under the player board can be tricky. Need to put something in the corners to lift the board up.
- can cause AP because so many balanced choices to choose from
- not very fun?

In La Granja, players control small farms by the Alpich pond near the village of Esporles on the island of Mallorca. Over time, the players develop their farms and deliver goods to the village. Players are vying to earn the title of "La Granja" for their country estate!

Over the course of 6 game rounds, players will expand their farm by adding fields, farm extensions, market barrows, and helpers. They will earn VPs by delivering goods to the village of Esporles. It is important to observe the actions of other players, manipulate turn order, and adjust your strategy based on the dice and cards.

At one point I had a concern that forgoing characters was the primary method to scoring higher.  I'm no longer of that perception, but I remain convinced that unless you plan to use an early character at least five of six rounds, you are better off using that card in another capacity.  I'm continuing to enjoy exploring the game space in this one and have found it continues to play fairly quickly in most instances.  There was one game with a couple of players who like to take time to analyze options where the game took much longer than I've generally experienced.  After a dozen plays, I feel that I can see the necessary connections to play quickly and smoothly. Some character cards can be great to play in the later rounds to score points (extra roof and the trade good to a die action choice are two that come to mind).

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Solid game with a mishmash of mechanics that work together rather well for the most part.  Nothing too innovative or new, but the aspect of being able to use a card four different ways was fun to explore.  As usual, there isn't nearly enough time or actions to do everything one wants and one must put together a plan and maintain focus throughout.  We learned from the rules and played our first game in just over 2 hours.

Very good Euro game on the heavier side. Kind of a hybrid of mechanics from several other games (card usage from Glory to Rome, market placement like Luna etc.).  Clever resource management and timing will make the difference and games should tend to be fairly close.

Very much by the numbers game with resources that can be turned into other resources that can get you valuable prizes.

If I'm playing a game and I'm not at a convention, I'm typically the one that bought it.  With that in mind, here's the best way to describe my feelings on this one after one play at Geekway:

This game felt like it had pacing problems to me.  The worst of them seemed to be remedied by one helper card (Olive Miller or something like that?  Turn olives into card plays), but there didn't appear to be enough cards of similar engine-building power to get them distributed to players in time to make enough of a difference.  I'd play this again, but only if someone else bought it and encouraged me to do so.  Until then, I've got a plethora of worker placement games and don't need this one.

I don't understand the high ratings on this one given that the genre has a lot of very good competitors.

A very good Euro that has elements of a Feld game, but is not by Feld.  You are trying to build out a farm and gain points on various tracks.  You can use cards in four different areas.  It has an interesting economic engine and clever game play.  

I was not keen on the graphic design and the yellow-green was on the board was not very appealing.  I know they were going for a rustic look, but that is only criticism.  If you like medium to heavy Euro's this is s good one.

La Granja has some interesting mechanisms, particularly the various ways cards can be used. I've several criticisms about it though. It feels sprawling. There are so many moving parts and they don't feel like they connect together. Another is that each turns feels the same... try to maximize points. Rinse, wash, repeat. So, really, no vibe to it other than... get more points. Down time is a problem too. Player turns can take quite long and it really isn't possible for the next player to start their turn early to save time because of possible impact from the current player's turn.

Superb game, I'll play it any time. The mechanic linking the multi-use cards and player boards is ingenious and provides limitless strategies and replayability. There's even a bit of take-that as you fight for a dominant position in the central market. Roof markers, trade commodities, donkey markers, craft buildings, craft markers and the siesta track all challenge players to run the most efficient farm possible, keeping even the most experienced gamer on their toes.

Really bland euro. Multi-use cards seems fun but they are all very generic to the point it matters little what you draw except first turn.

It's true, it does play like a Feld, with a Rosenberg theme. I enjoy the newness that la granja brings to the farming theme, removing the aged worker placement mechanic and replacing it with a variety of other great mechanics from other games. Although la granja has multiple mechanics, it doesn't feel like it was just thrown together, it really balances all of them very well. And i can actually feel the theme in this one! For a euro, i found the farming/ market theme to come through rather nicely. I find its inclusion of donkeys and siestas(aka nap time), really help to pull me into the game. What a well oiled machine.

(based on 1 play) Feld-ish, Rosenberg-ish, but leans toward Feld in a way I am not keen on. Not a bad game per-se, but one that left me utterly cold - I didn't feel like I was doing anything more than interacting with game mechanics. I also think the game could be improved by removing at least one element - possibly the positioning of pieces on the market?

It's almost like the designers' names are pseudonyms for Stefan Feld and Uwe Rosenberg. Given that statement, I'm slightly dissapointed that the result doesn't feel greater than the sum of its parts. It's also a bit on the long side and the text abilities of the cards don't always feel like they are worth the trouble. So: good game, but it won't replace anything from my game collection.

RATING: 7
A big part of a game's enjoyment for me with a euro has to do with the quality of the decisions I'm making.  Are there enough? Do they actually matter?  Are they too complex or too obvious?  This game offers almost constant decisions with meaningful results stemming from them. However, it also maintains this excellent balance of not feeling too overwhelming or complicated.  The game doesn't feel punishing -- everything is helpful in some way so it's certainly more about optimization.  There's some player interaction on the board, but not much in regard to actually paying close attention to what other player's are planning to do.  Turn order can be important and the market scoring can encourage watching others, but largely this is a really fun almost-solitaire puzzle.

I'm not usually a solo gamer, I tend to view boardgaming as a social activity, but I was so eager to try this game that I decided to try the solo rules, and would you know it, I fell in love with it. Afterwards I tried playing the game with someone else, and I found that both ways to play the game were equally enjoyable for me.

I'm head over heels in love with the multi-use card mechanism. I love the other aspects of the game as well, but the cards are my favourite. It's almost an aghony to choose how to play a card as you want to do all sides of it at once, and you are constantly forced to choose away great things, which I think is a sign of a really excellent game. I cannot wait to play it again, whether it's solo or with opponents.

I guess I'm getting jaded, which is perhaps reflected in the score, but I couldn't get too bothered, even though I was losing.  And what was it about building a roof?  That part of the theme almost left me laughing.

Solid 7. This game feels well designed. The mechanisms borrowed from other games fit together well, and while you feel there is too much to do it never gets overwhelming. In fact the phases of the game almost meter out the play, giving you a lot of leeway in overall strategy with small decisions at each step. It comes together in an enjoyable package and yet doesn't feel...necessary. I'm happy to play it, and I'm far above neutral on it, but it hasn't grabbed me. It doesn't feel special.

La Granja is unabashedly a mashup of game mechanisms popularized by Stefan Feld, Uwe Rosenberg, Carl Chudyk and others (the designers acknowledge as much in the manual). That doesn't make the game feel derivative at all though. For me, this is one of the best medium-weight euros of the past several years. The multi-use cards and massive combo-chaining make it a lot of fun (though that same combo-chaining can slow the game down at times). For me, it feels most like a Stefan Feld game, and yet I prefer it to many of his recent designs.

My first play had a troublesome teach, but even with that I found the game fiddly and somewhat overcomplicated for what it what trying to do. (I was telling people I wish it had about 20% fewer rules.) I do like the flow, but am still unclear what some of the point gathering mechanisms are meant to stand for.

I really like the way cards are used in multiple ways.  Definitely allows you to get a small engine going from round to round.  Appears to provide multiple paths to victory, with the special actions on the cards really allowing you to specialize in various ways.  There are a lot of interrelated pieces, but by the end of the first game, you'll have a strong understanding of how things work together.

La Granja takes Innovation's nifty card tucking mechanism and deploys it into...yet another resource conversion game. I'm sure there's a lot to like here for those who love games like Keyflower, Castles of Burgundy, and so on.

After two plays i'm still struggling to Rate this game.. I should love it as it ticks all the boxes with things i like in a game.. But it dosent seem to be hitting the spot for me, and i'm not sure why..

Three games played now, and boom the game clicked with me this time, i'm not sure if it was the combination of cards or that a strategy became apparent or maybe the game is a slow burner for me.. Either way i want to play it some more.. All games have been a two player and it seems to me with more that the Market mechanism may become more interesting/tight and the grapple on the siesta track/donkey tiles would become more tense, both would be a positive i think...

After watching some videos showing gameplay and reading that it's kind of a hybrid of some the ideas present in Rosenberg and Feld games, I was really confident that La Granja would work out really well for my wife & me. And it did! I really enjoy the 'cards used for multiple purposes' pseudo-mechanic (even though Glory to Rome didn't work out for us), and that was my favorite part of this game.

Some people have noted similarities between La Granja and Agricola (thematically) and Glory to Rome.  For what it's worth, my wife & I both enjoy La Granja substantially more than either of those games.

RATING: 7.2
After one play, I am quite impressed by this game. There is a lot going on but the round structure is quite simple.
I can recognise elements from other games:
Central tile placement from Luna;
Multi use cards from Glory to Rome;
Power card effects from Agricola.
The game would benefit from better production (fiddly VP chips etc.) but overall the whole game meshes the elements well and everything works.
I expect my rating to rise with more plays.

3/5/2016: Update, 2nd play.  Enjoyed it more this time, not sure why, but I did.  Fun, solid, and good Euro.

Good enough game, just not sure it is ownership worthy.  Little bit of an annoyance sliding the cards under player board (which needs standoffs).  Game was a little bit too mechanical and dry for my tastes.

One of the most enjoyable Euros I've played in awhile. I was a little intimated by the busy board and overly-informative graphic design, but it came together pretty quickly for me. Feels heavily influenced by Feld's games, which is a positive for me. I can safely say that if you're a fan of Feld, La Granja will probably be right up your alley. I like that the game gives you a ton of freedom to do what you want, although I wonder just how deterministic the scoring is once you've peeled back the layers. As long as you play intelligently, games are seemingly neck and neck no matter what you go for. Still, it flows very smoothly, and it's been awhile since I've played a proper Euro that is this satisfying. Unfortunately it may not hit the table that often since you're looking at a good 90-120 minutes per game.

UPDATE: Surprisingly not good enough to warrant repeated plays. I really applaud this game for what it sets out to do, but unfortunately, it's not something that's flashy enough to draw me back in. I would be happy to play it if asked, but the orderly phases to each round and the deterministic scoring coupled with a pretty dry theme don't really excite me. Still probably my favorite game that employs multi-use cards though. At least, next to Innovation.

La Granja is a game of many well oiled mechanisms that still fails to engage me. The core of the game is to acquire, upgrade and deliver resources to earn victory points. However, there are so many ways to do this (and so many alternative ways if your opponents accidentally should get in your way) that it's more about optimizing every little action rather than building an engine or adapting the strategy to the opponents' actions. In addition, none of the mechanisms is used to its full potential - you don't get to build a powerful engine, you don't get to set up powerful card combinations and so on. La Granja's "mechanism salad" may help you learn which mechanisms you prefer but once you've done it, there are other games that have implemented them better.

This is a game about efficiency and managing your cards. The idea that your card can be played in four ways is very interesting, and a lot of the time the choices aren't obvious. The competition among player is peaceful and meaningful. 

The only downside is that it might get a bit repetitive, delivering different commodities to contracts don't sound exactly interesting, especially when you are doing multiple of it in a game.

RATING: 8
I'm a sucker for really effective player boards, and the player boards for this game are great.  They organize and inform the game incredibly effectively.  Phenomenal.

Personally, in terms of game play, I still prefer Agricola.  I think because Agricola is just a little bit less chaotic...or maybe I'm using "chaotic" as simpler.  The decision matrix for La Granja can be quite involved, and I wouldn't want to play it with someone who felt the need to optimize each turn.  Both games provide a sense of building something, and I think that, again, Agricola somehow manages to capture that better.  La Granja's "farm" is just a little bit to mechanically dense, and so it doesn't have that playful attitude that Agricola captures so well.  

That said, I currently think that La Granja is pretty fantastic.  I find the iconography to actually be VERY quick to pick up.  Yes, the cards are a bit vague, and it takes a while to get the swing of when you can do what.  I also find the craft houses to blend in too much with the market area.  They could have been pictorially segregated better.  But the game play is satisfying.  It isn't so much about creating an engine as it is about momentary combos.  Every player is going to experience a nice combo during the game, and that's where the satisfaction really comes from.  The scoring at the end...I'd consider it something of an after thought, though the game IS going to reward the most points to whomever is best at combinatorial thinking!  Normally, that ain't going to be me!

This game borrows a number of mechanics, but it does it well. Borrowing from Glory to Rome, a card can be placed in four places in your player map to have four different functions. The central board borrows from Stefan Feld's Luna game where when placing into a market allows you to displace lower ranked cubes. Also there is the dice selection mechanic which isn't new. 

It's a farm game, and during your turn you can trade for whatever goods you need, which is a good rule.

Over 6 rounds you are trying to worry about the market, the craft buildings and roof tiles. It does draw comparison's to Agricola since if you have 2 pigs you can breed a thrid pig. 

I've played 1 1/2 games. The games do tend to clock in slightly long, just around 3 hrs for 4 players, so that is one knock against it, but I am fully engaged. There are lots of things to think about and it is tense. Rating may rise with more plays.

RATING: 7.5
It felt very feldian, and I like most of Feld games,so...
I find a bit limiting the long-term strategies, I would say that there are only 2: go for the market barrows (central marketplace) or go for the external one; I blame the special effects of the cards for this. I would have loved some more freshness on these, pushing you in other directions, like: get extra VP for every pig in your farm, get extra VP for every non-built roof. In other words some mechanism that rewards also specialization.
Love:
- Decisions regarding how to use the cards.
- not difficult to grasp.
- dice, draw cards and limiting the external market give enough replay-ability.
Meh:
- Feld has overloaded the boardgame scene with games that reward you for everything you do, non the less I would say his games push you a bit more to specializacion. 
- interaction in the central market has no control. You got cards to sell goods to the 2/3 and 4 spots, delaying the delivery to avoid the 5 of an opponent punishes you too much to the point that you don't care, place it and move on.

Schönes Ackerbau- und Viehzuchtspiel. Der Mechanismus der multifunktionalen Karten gefällt und macht das Spiel sehr denklastig (im positiven Sinne) - wie kann ich diese Karte jetzt am effektivsten nutzen? Der unaufdringliche Würfelmechanismus bringt ein weiteres Zufallselement ins Spiel.

Schöner (und vor allem zweckmäßiger) könnte das Material sein - es ist nicht so einfach, die Karten unter sein Spielfeld zu schieben, ohne dass alles sich darauf verschiebt. Toll wäre es auch, statt der universellen Craftmarker (die fast alles repräsentieren) thematisch gestaltete Marker zu nutzen. Aber das ist sicher nur eine Feinheit.

Enjoyed the one 2 player game. While Agricola and this are both farming euros - they are on opposite ends of the spectrum. 

La Granja is the more permissive one - there are a multitude of options for converting goods to another. The multi-use cards are a nice touch, but the sense of 'Freedom' is La Granja's biggest USP. 

Freedom also translates to a loss of the tightness in Agricola - so it might not be for some. 

Will probably buy this.

A very nice mishmash of established gameplay elements, and cards with multiple uses always work for me. The market hex scheme (from Luna) felt slightly out of place to me, though.

Terminology could have used a bit more tuning, and the cards are very ambiguously worded. This leads to lots of referring to the rulebooks and then rechecking the forums once you don't find the answers in neither the rules nor the card list. Some essential details (for example, considering timing) are also missing from the rules. Still, the rulebook is a lot easier to read than I expected based on the original publisher.

The player boards are a little too small for fitting the cards properly. The setup is also slightly heavy in the luck-of-the-draw department regarding card texts.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]I was very high on it last year and a year later my thoughts and feelings haven't changed, La Granja is an excellent game. La Granja manages to combine a bunch of different game mechanisms found in other games into a cohesive, fun game play experience. First of all I really enjoy multi use cards in games and it is nice to see it executed so well in a heavier Euro game. The dice drafting also works well and forces you to sometimes rethink your plans. Every time I play I enjoy figuring out how I am going to approach scoring points since there are multiple paths you can go down. However; this is not a point salad game, you are rewarded for focusing on a specific path. The variety in card powers really make this game a joy to play since you are constantly uncovering different synergies between all the mechanics of game play.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8/10):[/COLOR]

[i]- An excellent integration of multi-use cards in a mid-weight euro.
- There are a variety of effective strategies you can pursue, but you need to focus because this is definitely not a point salad game.
- For a game with this much strategy it plays quick, about 25 minutes per player. Set up is also quick for this type of game.
- Excellent 2p game, I found the 4p game dragged a bit. 2 - 3 players will be the sweet spot for me.

I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this game. I thought it might feel like a rehash of ideas from different games crammed into this one. Instead La Granja delivers a very tight game experience where individual mechanics are all integrated into the overall game play experience. Some of my favorite games have multi use cards (RftG, Fleet and Glory to Rome) and I was excited to see this executed in a mid-weight euro (for the record I don't really care for Bruges). The decisions you have to make with the cards aren't easy either, usually you want a card for at least two of the four possible uses and optimizing how to use the cards for the right actions will go a long way in determining how well you do in this game. 

La Granja also manages to offer a really tight experience where you really need to focus on your particular strategy for that game. Additionally there isn't a punishment mechanism built into La Granja so you have more freedom right out of the gate as opposed to a game like Agricola (which I love, but can understand how some people find it too punishing). I'm glad I finally decided to buy a copy of La Granja and I look forward to many more plays this year.[/i]

RATING: 7
I was prepared to hate this game but I'm very glad I didn't rest with that opinion. From first look, the various uses of the cards for different benefits is one of the most aggravating mechanics for me in a Euro; it utterly stops the flow of the game in its tracks. And anything that contributes to AP, I abhor. However, every time it happens in this game, it happens at the same time to every player. Whew! On top of that mechanic, are a couple of very Feld-ian flavors: tile "displacement" from Luna, dice-"worker" placement from Bora Bora and Castles of Burgundy, not to mention the hard and fateful "if only..." decisions when it comes to resources. All in all, a good Euro I'm glad I revisited.

RATING: 3
Looked complicated, but really simple. Expected a bit heavier brain burner but there isn't much to think about. Would put this at medium light gateway game. Scores are way too close (first game was 1 pt difference) which proves it doesn't matter what you do. The cards offer variety but you only see three helpers for the whole game. Fields are weak. and we only built one each. 

Too easy to get the resources you need, when you need it. Many upgrade options, or just pay cash. Dice selection for revenue usually always gives you what you want since you get five dice to put on six slots. Very telling that there wasn't one time during our die selection phase where I thought "oh no, she took the die I really wanted!" There was never any tension. Very gentle, very forgiving, solitary experience with little interaction, except for the market square where you push out other workers. Makes zero thematic sense. 

Some parts of the game are really weak and tacked on, like the roofs. After buying the first two, they get way too expensive for their measly pt and tile reward, since money is always tight.  In a two player game, we only managed to buy three roofs between us.  

building barrows clearly the best way to get points.

The victory point chits are really lame. So much wasted time constantly converting them to add to your large pile. Who had the idiotic idea to say "Let's lose the point track and make it extra fiddly!"
 
Only six rounds but most of those rounds are quite repetitve and unexciting. After all the hype on this, I expected much more. Also fairly drab artwork. Should have stayed out of print. 

We enjoyed it for about half its length but i can see there is not much replayability here. We had no desire to play it again. It certainly didn't leave me pleasantly astonished like I was after finishiing my first game of Madeira.

 My wife called it "A slight step above 'mensch argere dich nicht'. Good for kids."

I've only played this game once, but first impression is good even though our session was a bit chaotic since noone knew the rules in full. I like that every card have four alternative functions so you need to choose but the difference between the cards are a bit to small. Yes it's easier to balance a game where every card does more or less the same thing, but is also more boring. I'd like to see cards that are a bit stronger on all sides, so it is more difficult which function to choose. Then there can be "standard" cards which are less powerful on all sides. As it is now the choices you make is which cards you chose to play as Helpers and maybe market stands. the other sides have too little variation so all you need is usually always available. 

Timing on when to be starting player or last player is also very important. Usually you want to be starting player to get the roof you want, but you want to be the last player especially in the last round to be the one to deliver last and get to keep your scoring for the market. 

I made the mistake to believe the rooftops were better later on, but they aren't you want to buy them as soon as possible. The only difference it that the prices go up.

La Granja is a farming game that borrows extensively from other euro-style games.  Like in Agricola, players expand their farm board to automatically produce various crops, as well as pigs if they have a breeding pair.  Players are also dealt cards that grant the players rule-breaker abilities.  That's where the Agricola comparison ends--the cards are actually multi-purpose cards that get tucked under the player's board depending on how they want to use them, a little like Glory to Rome.  Special abilities get tucked on the bottom, crop production gets tucked on the left, income and animal storage get tucked on the right, and wagons for order fulfillment get tucked on the top.  The game is ultimately an order fulfillment game, and players have the choice to complete wagon cards for points and placement on a Luna-like center board for point income, or complete orders on the central board for big income bumps and special powers.  The main meat of the game comes in a dice-drafting phase, in which players choose dice that represent actions that they can perform on the turn.  While this game definitely combines a lot of different mechanics, I actually felt like it tied together very well.  The production aspects combined with the order fulfillment provided a lot of rich opportunities for planning, and the special ability cards really helped define your strategy.  Enjoyed this one all around.

I've always liked the idea of tucking cards, but in reality, it's physically annoying.

I'm unsure about this game. There is a lot to love about it and yet I'm not 100% sold on it. I worry there aren't a TON of strategic paths to go down and it's more just who can build the buildings the fastest or who can control the market. Maybe it will be more tense with 3-4 players, but with 2, I largely got what I wanted and was able to dominate the buildings. Didn't have to worry about the markets.

Agricola without the charm. Castles of Burgundy without the... well, I guess WITH the boredom. Extremely derivative design that has nothing new to offer except new iconography to learn, new resources to play around with, and the one thing this guy added to the genre: multi-use cards. Yeah, stay with me here...

The cards have four different sides and can be slotted into four different areas of your board; right side for farms, bottom for helpers, left side for fields, top for delivery barrows. Kind of cute, except the delivery markers stick too far to the left and right and everybody kept thinking they had some function when they tucked them as fields/farms, so obviously not well designed. 

Iconography is not completely consistent, either. VPs are denoted by little sunbursts in every place in the game EXCEPT when you deliver the barrows, then they are pictures of a market. 

Game just exists to put you through paces of a eurogame. You deliver to markets and unlock new ones. You allocate dice for actions (from a common pool, of course). You make resources and turn then into other resources which you then turn into points. You have nine different types of things you can spend/collect and it's all so wonderful except none of it is wonderful at all. It's a distraction that has distractions baked in to distract you from the fact that this game has nothing to offer.

Yo dawg, I heard you liked distractions...

I've never heard of this game until today at my local board game meetup. It's a mix of previously familiar mechanisms together forming a solid euro game. I had fun playing this game.

RATING: 7.5
First Game with 4p. Like the Mechanisms, everything fits together, but sometimes a little to much Point salad for my taste. I had the Feeling that at no point in this game there was any tension.
 
The Cards are sometimes too off Topic imho. I am not one who Needs a thematical 100% fitting game for being happy with it, but sometimes the effects here were very strange in correspondence with the characters on the cards. But all this has to be figured out in further Plays.
My biggest con are the somewhat little pieces and also the "Card under the board" thing, while it's a great idea, it is very very fiddly. And there should definetely be more low number victory Point chits.

RATING: 8
Only played once, but this game indeed deserves a high rating. I think that the rating will only go up instead of down with more plays.

Nothing really new however: like the authors - honestly - mention in the rulebook: the kicking out of pawns in the market we've seen before in Luna and the different use of cards in Glory to Rome. But this game re-implements these game mechanics in an excellent way!

There are so many different things to love about this game. One of my favorite mechanisms is that of multi-use cards and in La Granja that agonizing balance of how to best put your cards to use is exquisite. But that's not all! In addition, there is a light tile laying/area control component in the town marketplace that adds to the care with which one must make decisions in choosing the usage of their cards. For one of the uses of those cards is to fulfill orders which may reward you with a stall in the marketplace. But which order to attempt to fill - the one that will be quick, but only yields a low value (and temporary) stall in the market, or the one that will take time to complete but provides a high value, stable market stall? There is also a great dice drafting variant used for additional resource/action collection and a great method to randomize setup for long term variation in game play. Though it may seem like this is a confusing hodge-podge of game mechanisms, it turns out that they work seamlessly with one another and provide an amazingly tight and tense gameplay experience.

Some games are so simple they're more of an activity than a game; they have too few strategic decisions.

La Granja is such a convoluted mess of mechanics, resources and points that it feels not simple enough to be a game, but it's a pleasant activity. If you like to push cubes for two hours and then find out who won, La Granja is for you. I'm done after two plays, though.

A less confrontational, mind-frying agricultural experience than Agricola (but it's still a med-heavy game). Perhaps a bit of 'point salad', but there are various strategic choices and paths to vp. Clever multi-use cards and player boards by adding farm cards in various available locations around the outside edge. Player boards feel a little like mp-solitaire, but there is a common market board players are vying for control over.
-AP prone, rules are probably a little too dense, and gameplay a bit too open-ended, for our gateway friends.

RATING: 7
You might look at this and say this is a game about farming. Really, it's a game about games. This game is a remix album that comprises some of the greatest mechanical hits from previous board games. 

The parts that I enjoy the most are determining when to focus on income vs when to focus on actually scoring points, and the process of assessing which way the multi use cards will be the most effective. 

The die-based action selection is very intriguing, although it can result in a dull round from time to time.

In my first play of this game I felt completely overwhelmed. On my second play I was riveted by understanding the mastering how best to use my cards. My third play I started to notice how unexciting the central board mechanisms were. After my fourth play, I felt ok parting ways.

Got it for the theme (love farming games) and for the multiple use of cards. It's good but so far perhaps not as good as I had hoped. Always wish I could play many more cards to really make use of their different uses. But all in all not a bad solo farming game.
--
Several more games in this game has proven to just get better and better. I have only played solo so can say nothing of the multiplayer experience. But as a solo player it is really nice that the games vary so much depending on how the dice come out. In some games you'll be positively rolling in cards, in some games not so much. There are a lot of different possibilities and you just have to look at what's available and try to make the most of it. Very nice solo experience!

just a hodgepodge of miss matched mechanics that make little sense together. It created few interesting situations and sucked the intrigue out of the mechanics that had worked well in other games.

21.11.2017 - Initial impressions after two plays

The first game was a mess. Both game was two player only, in the first both of us just learned the mechanics with no overarching "masterplan". The rules could be written much better, the two different scoring methods for the market barrows and for the craft buildings made the game a bit tricky to learn, but from round 4 or so it was ok. 
The second game was already a much smoother experience: I started to see different patterns in the game, it seems to certaninly have many paths to victory. 
The game is a big sandbox, you have a multitude of options every time, and there are a lot of ways to achieve your goals. 
In opposite to the public opinion I don't think this is a point salad: as discussed in the forums, there are basically two main source for points, everything else contributes only marginally to your final score. 
I would like to highlight two design elements in the game: 
-the heated battle for the best stalls in the market area on the center board: it is ingenious, turn order very much matters, and the tempo and nasty surprises of card plays could turn this fight for position on its head in no time!
-the multi use cards: wonderfully executed, the four uses of each card is fantastic, and it is always an agonizing decision when and what to choose from the available options. The only downside: this game is not for beginners, those who just entered the hobby will be lost quickly in the mirriad of options. 
This is the prime example of pasted on theme. After five minutes you will forget that you are actually building a farm in Esporez, and the game loses the last ounce of thematic flair after the first 30 minutes. 
The graphic design is bland, but hey, you are here for the mechanics, aren't you? :)

If Stefan Feld and Uwe Rosenberg made a game together, I'm pretty sure it would be La Granja. Surprisingly the two styles blend together very well. The multi-use cards and the dice drafting/ action selection mechanics come together elegantly in a way reminscent of some of the best "point-salad" style euros. My only complaint is that the area control section of the board feels like filler actions that don't award enough points. Perhaps that is a good thing though, since it keeps the laid back nature of the game intact.

+ high fun factor with different ways to invest in your farm

+ 4 different ways to use cards: lots of options when paying a card

+ functional (graphical) design, structured game, clear players aid

+ rather quick to explain and play

+ random board setup and different cards make for a different game each time the game gets played.


- with only 6 game rounds and approx 6 to 12 cards to be played in the whole game, the game feels a little short to really enjoy your 'investments'.

- text on cards - bummer!

- except for the 4 different ways to use a card, to me the game slightly lacks 'personality', as the mechanics are borrowed from previous games like Luna. Still this game brings them together nicely.

Fiddly is the first word that comes to mind. It's not bad by any means but suffers from pointless little rules that do absolutely nothing to make the game better.

The helpers are pretty underwhelming and a good 10% are tied to the dice rolls, making them a crap shoot. Either way while their impact is pretty minimal they certainly give a flavour without which La Granja would be an exercise in converting A to B -> deliver not worth the playing time.

As it is, it's OK. I'll play if asked, but NOT with hidden VP - this game needs a scoring track badly, else you'll spend a good chunk of your time swapping chits for no good reason but that the designer thought it was a smart idea.

Oh dear! Almost nailed it, but what a fiddly beast this is. With enough stop start scoring actions to rival The Castles of Burgundy this would be an excellent online computer game, but in the flesh it needs players willing to concentrate through each scoring action and each fiddly this and that to enjoy. Nothing is helped by the completed market spaces crowding the central market - why place the completed space there and not to the side of each market? There are rather strange valuations that experienced players will avoid - the Trade Commodity Craft Building for instance. At least half of the cards don't seem to have any balance at all. There's the potential here to be a really good game, but a few tweaks would have really helped.

All the right mixtures for the Glory to Rome / Agricola / Yspahan lover. Multiple use and multiple position cards, dice resource / action selection, farming for points. I like many individual components here. Plays reasonably fast - under 90 minutes with four players from cracking the box open to putting it away. Very little downtime with experienced players as actions are either simultaneous, or quick, little steps. The problem lies in the Anytime Actions breaking the flow of the game and messing with the turn order. There's plenty of flexibility and plenty of decisions, but it doesn't bog down in over thinking. You get to the end and just hope that everyone collected every last victory point they were entitled to and that's that. A certain back of the mind lingering doubt remains however.

It's a really well-done game with lots to think about and plan for. You always want to do more than you are able, which is often a good sign for me. I really like this one a lot.

So it's good, but is it great? I'm not so sure. It has various pieces Frankensteined together, and all of it works really well. But nothing really puts it over the top for me. I like this one really a lot, and look forward to many more plays, but nothing so far pushes it from 8 to 9 for me.

La Granja is a fun farming game. With how many ways there are to get the different resources, my main concern has been whether there would be enough variability in the game, but so far I've been impressed. It doesn't seem like there is that much variability until you've played it multiple times and realize that your early cards, which 3 craft buildings are available at the beginning of the game, and the dice in the first 2 rounds can make an enormous difference on the feel of the game. After round 2 you can get the resources you need other ways if you've been focusing on doing that, but the dice distribution in the first 2 rounds has a big impact on how strong of a start you get. Because the dice are drafted, when one player gets a weak start, the other players generally get a weak start, so it doesn't unbalance the game, it just gives it a different feel.

RATING: 6
A cardboard chimera built from signature elements found in other games. The design wrangles together several mechanisms – cards with multiple uses, resource refinement, dice drafting and so on – and ties them together in a somewhat coherent package.

The main drawback to La Granja is that it's exactly the sum of its parts and doesn't offer anything distinctly different in its decision space. In fact, it's not even quite as deep as its appearance or description initially suggests. Another gripe is that the use of VP tokens is annoying and prone to error; I see very little reason why an open VP track couldn't have been used in this instance. It's still a commendable title nonetheless and a crowd-pleasing Euro at its best.

It's not a game I'd want to play often and a lot - but when I'm in the mood for a Feld-esque game that has a little more theme to it than Feld games do, this is a good 'un.

took a little while for me to understand the "engine" but I really like the options the cards give you -- figuring out what is strong took me some time, but I picked it up eventually. 

I like how markets open up based on demand allowing players to plan ahead.  I think the symbology on the player mats could've been a little better.

After my first play, my feeling is that this game may become my favorite. I need to play more to see if many strategies can lead to victory or it's there's a definite optimum. I also don't understand yet how to become good at this game. I love the challenge and thinking about strategies when I play this game. Very fun.

Unique cards that can be used in 4 ways. Lots to do, and flows well. The game starts a bit slow but I can see it go even longer if it didn't. Its one of those games where your turns get longer as your setup gets better. This can lead to a lot of downtime while others are going but, when its your turn, I guarantee you are into it.

Van itt minden kérem szépen, Burgund, Luna, Dicsőség Rómának és ebből egy nehéz eurót gyúrtak a szerzők. Egy farmot irányítunk, ahova lapokat játszunk ki, amikkel bővíthetjük a farmunkat, különböző tulajdonságokat nyerhetünk velük, piaci szükségleteket elégíthetünk ki vagy éppen ültetvényeket csinálhatunk. Azaz egy lapnak 4 funkciója lehet (aka Dicsőség Rómának), mi döntünk minden körben alapesetben egyről, hogy mire használjuk. Utána van egy bevételfázisunk, majd különböző bónuszlapok közül is válogathatunk. Majd jön egy termelés fázis, ezután pedig egy véletlenszerű kockadobás (Burgund) után különböző előnyök közül válogathatunk. Majd szállítunk a piacra vagy különböző más helyre árukat, amiért jönnek a győzelmi pontok, illetve a piacon helyeket elfoglalva Luna szerű kitúrásokat tehetünk. Van játék közbeni pontozás és fix hat kör. A játék igazai kőkemény euró, száraz és rengeteg lehetőség és sok út vezet a győzelemhez. Nagyon erősen azt éreztem a játék után, hogy milyen jó játék lehetett volna ebből, ha nem akarnak ennyire komoly játékot csinálni. Elég lenne körönként mondjuk egy lapból választva játszani, kevesebb szállítási hely is szerencsésebb lenne. Tetszettek a kártyák szöveges tulajdonságai, amik mind egyediek, jól kitaláltak. Tetszett a kockás előnyök rész, de nekem összességében valahogy sok volt. Abszolút nem rossz játék a La Granja és sikere is érhető gémer körökben, de valahogy nekem nem adott újat és ha kevesebb lenne nekem jobban tetszene. A Keyflowerre is 6-ost adtam, de annál azért jobban tetszett, de valahogy nem érzem, hogy hetest kellene adnom rá.

A very interesting take on a theme that has been over-done in the last decade. It's very refreshing to find a farming game that isn't worker placement, and doesn't have the "feed-your-workers-or-face-the-consequences" mechanic (which I despise).
While the game is mostly multiplayer solitaire (as most farming games inevitably will be) there are some fun, interactive moments during the dice-picking phase (Revenue) and the mini area-control part of the board (Market Stalls).
The multi-use cards are a nice touch, and scream of an ever evolving play experience.

Solid game but I'm not blown away. The multi use of the cards is clever but I never feel I can get a real engine going before the game ends. You have 3 slots for barrows but you never end up using that many of them. I dunno, maybe I missing something. Don't get me wrong, the game intrigues me, but I'm not sure if there is enough depth to keep me interested. It's also pretty darn themeless. The art direction the use of donkeys and ham and wine help a bit in this area, but not as much as I like. Less themed than Agricola.

Right in my wheelhouse. A worthy top-100 game, although it seemed to have slipped up there without a ton of hype. There's so much going on here. I love that the cards can be used in four different ways, and that three of them really are ongoing changes to your farm. It creates this delicious tension between adding a new order, providing you more supplies, giving you greater capacities, or having special abilities. I like that the goods can be upgraded and traded in, both as private contracts from your board, but also publicly in the middle board. It's always satisfying to complete a contract somewhere, and the tension of what contracts to fulfill nicely tightens the whole package up. Finally, you've got dice that provide action selection, giving you a challenging problem to solve in deciding which action to take. Best of all, die is always unused that gives an action that everyone can perform, so sometimes it can be interesting to leave that die and get the actions in the order you want them, or to use it and leave something else that doesn't really help your opponents.

This is an interesting, thinky game that sort of feels like a mix of Agricola (theme, with stuff you grow/harvest/use; occupations, sort of), Glory to Rome (multi-use cards where you slide the card in different areas of your board to show how you're using it), and Yspahan (dice rolling, allocation to several powers, players choosing dice). On the first play, seems a bit overwrought -- there is a LOT going on! But with repeated play things flow much better.

This is a euro game where each player is running a farmstead, new ground I know!  These games often attract me because of their mechanics more than their theme and this one is no exception, from the get-go I was drawn to this game because of the multi-function card mechanic this game has.

Each player is running a farm where they are producing goods and the main way of getting points is to fulfill orders or fill market stalls with the goods you produce.  The mechanics for this are reasonably simple on their own.  Dice are rolled each turn and players draft those dice to acquire resources, money, advance in turn order, and make deliveries.  Most points at the end of the game win.

The neat mechanic comes in just before the dice rolling and action drafting though when each player plays a card from their hand to one of the four sides of their player board.  Depending on the side they play that card to they will get a different benefit.  Cards placed on the left are fields that grow crops each turn.  Cards placed on the right are "farm extensions" that grant greater hand size, income, or spaces to store pigs.  Cards placed above are essentially orders players fill with their goods.  And cards placed below are "helpers" that grant special abilities (arguably the most interesting of the options).

This mechanic is brilliant and I always enjoy a game that utilizes it well.  Each option you select on your card means the opportunity cost of the other 3 options.  This makes for some really interesting decisions, incredibly variable games, and some real tension as sometimes you are forced to give up one really good option for another slightly better or comparable option.

The components are also wonderful.  The art is stylish and pretty, the pieces of each card line up perfectly with the nice thick and sturdy player boards and almost all of the pertinent information is printed on the components without seeming cluttered.

The only negative I can levy on the game is kind of a backhanded compliment.  The card play is so interesting and enjoyable that it is frustrating I can only play 7 cards across 6 game rounds (1 per turn with an extra play on the first turn).  There are certain ways to get extra card plays so most people will likely play more than those 7 but it still seems anemic considering that is the best part of the game.

I love the mechanics of this game, the multi use cards, engine building, fulfilling contracts, dice drafting, and the center market (not sure what this is called, but similar to Luna). I had really high hopes for this game, but it fell flat. I felt like it should have been easier to play more cards to help build up your engine, but the games ends just as you get the engine going. One thing that I was very frustrated with was the structure of the round, the game just never seemed to flow as you constantly were referring to the player aid for what was next, even in the last round. 

Maybe this game just needs another play.

I like farm themed games. La Granja starts slow, giving not a lot of opportunities to players in order to develop their strategies but then, after a certain point, players realize that the economy is set to go and opportunities start to show more efficiently and the game gets more interesting.

It's a shame that La Granja is not more widely distributed as it's for sure one of those games that a lot of people would appreciate.

Not a fan of the cards in the game, or really any game where all the cards do wildly different things. Also just really hate tucking them into the board. There's just no way to get it done smoothly. The game could also just use a normal scoring track. All that, combined with all the little tokens flying around contribute to an overall fiddly experience.

Another complaint involves the manual and the terminology used in the game, which I feel was implemented inelegantly. I feel that they could've made better use of icons. Why not display icons of the various things in the game that apply to an effect, as opposed to forcing players to remember the difference between a harvest good, a farm good, and a resource? Why not make better use of diagrams in the manual instead of making players read through 5 pages of definitions? Lot of things that could've just been handled differently to make it easier on the end user.

Everything else is fine though. I like the dice drafting and the bit of area control that goes on in the central board. I also think it's clever how the same pieces are used to represent various things based on where they're placed.

There's a lot of game here, but without the rules confusion - the game is quick to learn, and fun to play, but with huge amounts of variety to dip into with each card having 4 potential uses (and with 66 unique workers). This is the kind of euro that I really enjoy, along with Deus, Orleans and Ginkgopolis. A really good game.

RATING: 8
A really solid resource conversion game with Agricola-like development cards with Glory to Rome-like multiple uses and many places to score points, dice usage and tile tracks that are similar to Castles of Burgundy. So yes, there are a mish-mash of mechanisms from other games but they work together fine and are reasonably thematic. It feels and plays like a Feld game but you won't be scoring 200 points in this and so don't have all the marginal point calculations. The lifeblood of the game is the cards ability to let you craft a strategy between fulfilling contracts, extending your farm, increasing your income and getting special abilities that make the game come alive. 

The game takes a little bit to get to grips with the flow of the game but comes together in a pretty easy to play manner and should play quite quickly with a little experience.  The exception is the last round which gets slows as everyone carefully calculates exactly what they can deliver. I can see the game starting to feel a little repetitive over many games as you go through the same steps and your engine grows without much effort. This really depends on whether the cards have enough variety in them. I can't say as I didn't have time to look over them all.

A somewhat novel dice mechanism + the card flexibility of [thing=19857][/thing] + the board scoring from [thing=70512][/thing] + resource trading = a very [person=4958]Feld[/person]ian game. I thought I would like it and I do. Every turn is just filled with decisions that are hard and meaningful but not frustrating. There are multiple strategies to explore and the card variability give it somewhat of an [thing=31260][/thing] level of variability. And it plays in under 2 hours. Great stuff!

Apparently, multi-use cards is an exciting new thing. Haven't I seen that in 800 other games before?

I seem to recall quite enjoying this, even though I'm not 100% sure I did at the time.

The dice drafting didn't seem significant, right up until the point where it was. I honestly don't even recall who won, even though the game was about a fortnight ago. Perhaps that is the most telling thing.

La Granja felt a bit like a mash-up of all of Stefan Feld's games and Agricola. I liked the complexity and some of the ideas, but the game feels too much like a solitaire puzzle to me. And that puzzle often is a guessing game ... if your strategy requires certain actions to be successful and the die rolls don't make that action available, things can get very rough for you. So, while this held my interest to a certain extent, I'm guessing the high luck factor and dry, solitaire puzzle-y feel to the game mean it won't be topping my play list.

Huh.  This is a hard game to rate after one play.  For now, I'll give it an ambivalent 6.5.

But that might be too harsh a rating.  It is an amazingly intricate design, fusing elements from various previous designs into... a well-oiled mega-machine?  A Frankenstein's monster?  ...I'm not sure which.

My nagging issue with the game is that it's too complicated for what it is.  There are gears within gears within gears, and everything is slathered in iconography.  I don't know if I've ever been so bewildered when being taught a game before.  At least with a game that's trying to be a simulation, my brain can lock onto how the mechanics are a representation of something, or some niggly rules can hold off being described until a situation comes up.  With this game, though, the poor teacher has to basically back up a garbage truck overfull of a mishmash of rules and dump it on the players.

So, at first, part of me despised the game.  It's frustrating to sit there for an hour with little idea what you're doing or why you're doing it.  Just moving pieces around for some unknown reason.  It made me respect the parsimonious designs of classic Euro designers like Knizia and Kramer all the more.

But, to the game's credit, it does start to click after you've played two or three rounds.  I was enjoying myself by the end of the game and I began to recognize and appreciate its more competitive aspects.  This will never rank among my favourites, but I think my rating would increase a bit if I got in another play or two before all those rules completely leak out my ears.

Very well balanced game, that nicely puts together several mechanisms from other games. 
Reminiscent of Agricola in that you are dealt a set of  ( in this case 4) cards to begin with from a deck of 66 cards and of course concerning the farming theme. With the difference that you will get more cards throughout the game. Plays smoothly and the rules are 
a) easy to grasp
b) easy to teach
c) and easy to follow due to the perfectly structured player aid

After all of the positivity and comparisons to euro games that I love, I was really surprised by how much I disliked this one.

This game does have the feel of a Feld game, as any review will tell you, but that can both be a good and bad thing. For me this game highlights the bad aspects of Feld games. You have a set of actions that you can do (buy goods, upgrade goods, make deliveries, gain money, etc.) and you just chain those actions together the best that you can. If I need to do action A, first I have to do action B, C, then D, and now I finally have what I need so that I can do action A. It just feels like work, and not in a good way.

The dice element feels out of place. You roll a bunch of dice and then players draft the dice to get bonus actions. I don't have any real insight about it, it just feels out of place and the decisions during this part are obvious. It feels like they just wanted to add one more mechanic to the game for no reason.

The main board where you place your markers after making deliveries (I forget the actual game terms) seems like it can create a real rich-get-richer issue. When you place your maker on a high-numbered spot not only do you get a lot of points, you also knock other players off the board and prevent them from getting some points.

I'm not sure if the person teaching the game got a rule wrong, but it also seemed like the market buildings (along the outer edge of the main board) were not worth pursuing. You essentially have to invest a lot of resources for a small reward, and in the later rounds there is no incentive to do that.

This one just failed to deliver.

La Granja was the only game that I signed up for ahead of time at ConnCon. I'd seen a little bit about this game and was really excited to try it.

And... yeah, I really really liked it. There's a good bit going on in the game and a lot to decide. The rules explanation was a little overwhelming but once you got into the game everything just started making sense.

Every round there's a starting phase where you play a card, get your hand refilled, get any income (usually not much), and produce stuff in your farms. There are a couple of mechanisms that you can use to play additional cards later in the round, but it's a little painful to do so as you're giving up something else. Then you have an opportunity to buy a rooftop... which is just a special bonus, but if you buy more of them you end up getting more points. There are only enough so that each player can have one and no player can buy more than one a round. There's only six rounds and you have space for five of them, so you really want to buy one every round. And while they get more expensive as the game goes on, the bonuses on them don't get better.

Cards can be played in one of four ways. If you play the card to the left of your board, it becomes a field which generates some crop every turn (olives, wheat or grapes). If played to the right of your board the card becomes a way of holding pigs, increasing your hand size and generating income (money is really tight in the game). If played to the bottom of your board it becomes a special ability, whatever is printed on the card. And if played to the top of your board, it becomes a delivery order which you can fill... which requires a bit more explanation (later). So when you get cards, you really have to evaluate what you can do with them, where you want to play them, and if you want to get them out now or save them for later.

Then there's a phase where you roll dice and assign them to one of six possible actions... all of which involve getting farm stuff (olives, wheat, grapes or pigs), getting money, getting free deliveries (which are limited), or a choice between going up on the turn order track and processing goods (which turns the basic goods into food, wine or cured ham). Each player takes a die in turn order and does the associated action. Then they pick another die and do that action. There's one extra die which isn't taken and every player gets to take that action as well.

Then there's a phase where you resolve turn order and make deliveries. You have four delivery tiles and you choose one for the current round. You won't get tiles back until you've played all but one of them. The tiles allow you to make deliveries and/or go up on the turn order track... and if you choose a tile with more deliveries it will have fewer bumps on turn order and vice versa. You get points for being higher up on turn order, and that also determines the order in which deliveries will be made. At the end of the round, turn order tokens are reset to zero, keeping the same order in the stack.

Deliveries are a huge part of the game. You can deliver to your personal wagons, which gives you 2 through 6 points, with harder to fill contracts giving more points. Additionally, it lets you get a wildcard which can be redeemed at any time for either a pig, two harvest goods, two free good processings (which while they can be done at will normally are expensive in a game where money is tight) or the ability to draw or play one card. When you make a delivery to your personal wagon, you get to place a marker on the central market in a spot that has a number equal to the number of points it scored (harder = higher). When you place on that spot you can knock off any opponents on adjacent spots of a lower value, which gains you an extra point for every one you knock off. Additionally you get points at the end of the round for every marker you have on the board. So you want to make hard deliveries to get points from this area and knock off your opponents.

Alternatively, there are six areas on the board where you can make deliveries. Each player can only deliver to each of these areas once. Each one gives the player a special ability that persists through the game. And three spots are randomly locked off at the beginning of the game. The three spots that are open give a bonus point to the player who first completes that spot... and that opens up one of the locked spots, giving that player another point. So there's a race to be the first player to open spots.

The game sounds more complicated than it is. The main challenge of the game is how you manage the cards you're given and evaluating which of the four ways it can be used best suits your purposes, while building up your farm and turning stuff into deliveries for points. There's enough stuff going on so that you can sink your teeth into the game, but not so much that you'll be swamped by the game.

After playing this game, I knew that I had to have it. Unfortunately it's not available domestically until later this year. So it'll probably be a while before I have a chance to play it again.

Pros: 
- Deep strategy, paths to victory, all that
- Lots of variability and strategy in the cards
- Nice dice drafting mechanism
- Attractive art and theme

Cons: 
- Few, if any, original mechanisms
- Some aspects that feel very dry and anti-thematic (selling money in the market. Riiiight...)
- Solitairish, with a tacked on area control module
- Repetitive, simple set collection/order fulfilment to gain advantages and make points

one play only, at 4 player count.  Not so good Euro.  I like the card completing aspect of the game, did not like the siesta track for turn order (it's silly and a really bad homage to Stefan Feld), the roof tiles felt tacked on as an unthematic element to force a draft into the game.  Many of the market spaces don't open up until nearly the end of the game, which was pointless, to me, and I felt you couldn't grow enough crops in your production season to get the results you wanted.  I'd play one more time to see if it gets better, but this was disappointing to me the first time.

La Granja is a Euro design through and through. Resource conversion, dice-rolling, action selection, delivery of goods, spatial map for scoring, multi-purpose card play, turn order track, etc. Pretty much all the familiar elements of a Euro design. This is not to say the game is bad. In fact, the game is quite decent and manages to deliver on all fronts. Folks who enjoy their Euros will love this game. It has a bit for everyone. I found the game pleasant, with lots of decisions but ultimately a bit too chaotic. Everyone is dealing with their own farm/tableau and this is more or less a single player solitaire experience.  The variety in the selection of cards will make this game replayable but the game is not what I would consider elegant. There are a lot of fine details and a huge amount of special power cards that bogs the game down. I also think the spatial map is truly not necessary as the goods are constantly ejected from the game and I do not think it contributes anything to game play, thematically or otherwise. It can be completely removed or repurposed for scoring. For example, I'd much rather they convert the goods for majority scoring.

Overall a decent but not exactly memorable game.

Clever little "Franken"-game, with its mix of mechanics from popular designs. It has dice drafting, multiple use cards, area control, and multiple paths to victory. It's just missing card drafting, which could be easily house ruled into the setup.

But really, the game is fun. Cards are played to your farm as workers with unique abilities, extensions with different income, fields for growing crops, or market stall to sell materials. Goods are also multi-use - a single goods token is used to represent all available goods (crops, wine, pigs, etc) based on its location. The game moves along pretty quick, even with its multiple phases. Lots of fun for fans of Rosenberg, Feld, and/or Chudyk.

I absolutely adore this game. The ability to play each card in 4 different ways is very unique. The die rolls also create scarcity certain resources each round, making turn order very important. It can lend it self to analysis paralysis, so be careful who you play it with.

Played once, 3p.
Dry conversion point salad with tacked on theme and too many mechanisms. The problems start with the cards, because you only get a few during the whole game, yet some cards seem much more powerful than others, i.e. play an extra card for 2 silver.

On the central board you can deliver goods, and claim spots on the market, from which you can be kicked if the neighbouring spot has a higher number. Why is that?

Dice are drafted for bonus actions and there are no ways to influence the results.

La Granja reminds me of Russian Railroads, My Village and Great Western Trail, but only the latter I enjoy.

A good game, but nothing special to me. I'd call it a "typical dry Euro" with a standard farm-y theme. I frequently enjoy this theme, but it didn't do anything special for me in this one. The art is nice and unified, but not especially appealing or unique. Game owner described this as 4 or so games in one and that's accurate. Teaching all the little mini-game-like aspects took almost half as long as the game takes to play, and they're not tied together very strongly. All the players in our game agreed the middle market stall area seemed almost totally random for this theme and was an afterthought. 

I do love the player boards and component quality and design in general. Slotting cards into the left, right, top, or bottom of your board is by far the best part of the game. Unfortunately, it felt like this was an afterthought by the designer and the core of the game didn't depend on these things and they were just nice bonuses to make your engine a little better, not dictate your overall strategy. 

I think Imperial Settlers, Grand Austria Hotel, or Castles of Burgundy would all be better alternatives to this game. None of them do quite as MUCH as Granja, but they all do their parts better. I'd play this again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to make sure I did.

Update 2nd play, 2018: I enjoyed playing this again, but I stand by what I said. It's good, but not great and there's other games that do similar things better. I think that I'd be a little frustrated at the game if I played it 2 or 3 more times in a short period. Once or twice a year is where I'd want this, which is a 6 to me.

RATING: 6
La Granja is a procedural euro with a wonderful, evocative theme and beautiful faded watercolour artwork. I can understand its appeal to people who like procedural euros but, ultimately, I couldn't summon up any enthusiasm for playing. The problem with procedural euros is that they're a rather plodding 'do this to do this to score points' with not much pizzazz. That's okay, but I'm more of an Amerithrash player. 

Scored 6 because I'm happy to play if in the right mood, but would rather play something else.

RATING: 6.5
Felt very Feld to me, and I generally don't like Feld. There are better dice drafting games out there. The most fun part was choosing where you wanted the cards to go and what you wanted them to do and I'd say that was the meat of the game. That, and efficiency. It was OK but I wasn't bowled over. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
After a few plays, my two main criticisms of La Granja are:

1) There isn't much interaction. Most of the game takes place in your head as you plan your future resource conversions and deliveries. The only time you really bump into other players is during the dice-drafting phase, and even there I'd call the interaction more incidental than proactive. If it wasn't for the randomness of the cards and dice, this game would have very little replay value. 

2) The different currencies are too fungible / there's too many different ways to skin the cat. This is one of those games where it's seemingly impossible to fall on your face. Didn't get something you needed during the drafting phase? That's OK, you can always buy it outright. There's pretty much nothing that can stop you from accomplishing your goals; the only thing separating players is how efficiently they went about it. Endgame scores are never that far apart. 

I would call La Granja the spiritual successor to Castles of Burgundy; if you like one you'll probably like the other.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I was hoping for more. Mediocre -- not bad, definitely not great. A mishmash of different games. La Granja lacks identity and real strategy. Like others have said, it's more of a tactical game with elements from different games. I don't really think this game knows what it is. Unfortunately, taking cool mechanisms from other games and making a game with them doesn't make a good game. Unloaded it.

This should have been called "Stefan Feld's Agricola". While the only mechanic that truly comes from a Feld design is the Luna inspired marketplace, the rest of the game still feels like something he would have put together. From the clever "goods and upgrades" system that uses a single type of pawn to represent half a dozen different goods to the point salad feel of the game's other actions, the Feld DNA is undeniable. Same with the multi-use cards. While those are more of a Race for the Galaxy/San Juan development, something about them still feels like a Feld riff.

Regardless of the heritage, it's a great game. Smooth and complex, it provides tons of decision points yet things move along quickly and it feels fairly difficult to ever make an entirely bad decision. There is little down time, since most of the game's actions can be handled simultaneously and often outside of any rigid turn structure. There's a lot of freedom in the game's special actions which can be triggered almost at will. Almost everything you do will generally net you something, so this is certainly nothing like the punishment farm of Agricola, despite the similar theme.

One of the year's best, I think.

I don't fall in love with a game easily after one play, but this is an exception. If you are a euro minded player, this is almost a must have! At first it seems a lot to swallow, but gradually you find out this is a very well constructed, smoothly playing and very intriguing boardgame. A cool mechanic were you can use your cards in four different ways. This guarantees you a lot of tactical decision making and an enourmous amount of replayability. In the mean time you can throw some dies during your way to victory and you have to maintain a certain majority in the market square. Basically a game with a lot of pieces, but the puzzle falls into place just nicely. I think it's time to adjust my Top 10!

This is one of the driest games I've ever played. I like the whole system of multi-purpose cards and dice drafting, there's a lot of short and long-term planning involved. La Granja is a neat puzzle, but the biggest problem I have with the game is that nothing struck me as particularly exciting about it. It's just another euro.

To many things mixed into one game. Needs steamlining.

The multi-use cards are nice, and the best part of the game. 

The market stall thing on the other hand is copied from Luna, and doesn't work well here. It feels like it was added in  the end to increase interaction (in addition to the dice selection), and needlessly cmplicates the game.

The roofs are another bad point. Simple extra actions that are itself too weak, so they needed to be augmented with victoiry points to be worthwile.

RATING: 7
The bastard offspring of Agricola, Castles of Burgundy and Glory To Rome! A less miserable experience of farming than the former can hope to offer. The mechanics of this card-driven affair inspired by GtR are equally dreamy. Only things holding it back is the Burgundyesque flimsiness of tile production and painfully minuscule main game board plus a handful of dreadfully worded careers. They still somehow cram all of the necessary detail on with a more visually satisfying finish than any of the aforementioned publications. Now somebody please blow it up to be enjoyed as it was intended, then I might actually be persuaded to buy a copy!

While this game does a solid job of combining different mechanics, it doesn't add anything particularly new or innovative to make it stand out. It seems to be in the jack-of-all-trades, master-of-none category. If I want resource management, I'll pull out Glass Road or Imperial Settlers. If I want multi-use cards, I'll play Race for the Galaxy or San Juan. If I want farming, there's always Gates of Loyang or even Viticulture. This one is second fiddle in all areas.

Tuck card and dice driven farming simulation. Great mechanic of rest for determining first player order and victory points. Makes sense.  Who is better off? The farmer that is working their butt off just to keep up, or the farmer that can raise the farm and still have time to smell the flowers? Immersed in the rat race myself, I appreciate this notion.  For my wife and I, this game hits all the right notes; We love farming. We enjoy luck of the draw and multi-use cards. Each card face can be selected as a special hired hand, or to plant a crop, to start a wheelbarrow to fill for market, or upgrade a farm building. As grown and raised Ameri-trashers, we loves our dice in the revenue phase. The random dice pool draft mechanic of worker actions is a bonus.  No matter what anyone says, you must endure some fiddling with card placement to your board which is at most only a slight distraction. Now, which of my farm sims, will this game replace?

RATING: 8
An engaging mix of Euro-mechanism including multi-use cards, dice-based action selection, and resource management. It is designed to have turns were you pull off power-moves, lining up actions to cascade and maximize efficiency. It looks like point salad, but the bulk of points come from delivering goods (essentially to private or public contracts). There is very little player interaction and the solo game does not feel much different than playing with 2, 3, or 4 players; the main difference is that the "bot" selects dice/actions is a predicable way and can be more easily manipulated and planned for than human players. Overall, the feel is similar to Castles of Burgundy, though they differ greatly in mechanics.

What an incredible Euro!  In this game you have cards with multiple uses.  With each card that you put in play, you have to choose one of four positions to put the card into your La Granja.  Each position changes the resources you acquire, the abilities you have, or the spaces you will have to place specific resources to send to the market.  The market mechanic in itself is really interested.  Do you go for easy deliveries where you can get some quick benefits, at the cost of making it much more likely to get kicked out of the market?  Besides the great card play, the dice drafting phase is always exciting because you factor in what you want as well as what your opponents want.  It's nice when the available spaces that you want can also deny your opponents of what they need.  I love how its hard to tell who actually won the game until you have revealed your victory points at the end.  Of course, this could be tracked, but it would be hard.  One of my favorite games ever!

This game feels like an homage to all things Uwe Rosenberg... with a sprinkling of mechanics from other games to flavor.  I really liked the multi-use cards and enjoyed using their various benefits to grow my tableau.  The need to thoroughly plan ahead balanced by the dice providing only so many of each action in the action phase made for a lot of interesting decisions too.  I've been trying to get away from Euros with too many moving parts preferring more streamlined designs... but La Granja might be good enough for me to get my own copy anyway.

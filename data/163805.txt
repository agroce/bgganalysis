Some of the concepts from Concordia make their way into this game. Unlike Concordia you should try to score points on practically every turn or you will find yourself on the wrong end of a losing score.

Buy ships, supply them with coal, run them for revenue, buy ships....

This summary of play is a little unfair on Transatlantic.  Play is driven by action cards and there is some hand building, as previously seen in Concordia.  There are also set collection elements.  Nonetheless, the game play doesn't really develop from start to finish and it  feels over-extended at a two-hour playing time.

The ship artwork is delightful and prodction quality is good.

A great game. I was expecting a lot because of the designer and because I like Concordia and love Imperial, but this game turned out to exceed my expectations. The game requires a few plays until it starts to shine as you begin to see all the options available each turn. There are so many small things you need to pay attention when making decisions on what to do and so many available options to select from (many just subtle variations from each other). Timing is very important also. The game ends quicker than you'd imagined. It gets compared to Concordia a lot, but it really is a very different game. For me it fixes Concordias biggest problem, which is the scoring, and also offers deeper and more nuanced gameplay. I love the theme and it comes through surprisingly well through the beautiful art and many of the mechanics (the ship colour scoring is somewhat gamey though, but make for a better game no doubt). All in all, one of the best games I've played and it keeps getting better each play. NOTE: Play with the President-variant, it makes the ships, and as such, the game more thematic and interesting.

Fun factor: 5/5
Strategy vs. luck: 5/5 
Mechanics/gameplay tied to the theme: 4/5
Component/art quality: 5/5 (maybe the prettiest game in my collection)
Replayability: 5/5

Don't compare this to Concordia, Mac Gerdt's masterpiece. You'll be disappointed (most games would suffer from the comparison), and despite some superficial similarities, it's a completely different game. Transatlantic is a game of set collection where you acquire steamships and deploy them to sea regions, where they produce income and points until old age sends them to the scrap heap. Each turns consists of a single action dictated by a card played from your hand, similar to the rondel-like mechanism in Concordia. Each ship scores points based on the colour of its flag, and each colour's "worth" can be manipulated. 

A solid euro game with beautiful art and components that feels too fiddly at times, especially in the end game scoring. Each card represents a unique, historical ship with unique characteristics. The moving and transporting is all very abstract, don't expect much flavour of "sailing". A mix of strategy and tactics with different paths to income and point generation.

First outing.  Frustrating game.  Aim is to get sets of markers.  One is the blue riband which requires placing the fastest boat in North Atlantic.  Quite possible, even likely, that a player cannot get a fastest boat - or can only achieve this by pushing the existing faster boats out of the North Atlantic through much sub optimal play.  We ended up with a stand-off with no player wanting to but a boat as it could lead to a faster boat which we all wanted.  End game had similar issue with five headquarters available, but with two purchases possible per player, one player in for player game likely to end up with none.  Rules on acquisition of headquarters were noticeable by the absence - but we assumed same rule as for boats.  Potentially a reasonable game.  But no enjoyment due to difficulty in getting blue riband tokens.

RATING: 7.5
Initially, these comments will be based on the game using the President card (and not the Director card). The default rules use the Director card, but the designer intended for the President card to be the true experience -- and I agree. The President card is better than the Director card. The President card allows for the varying stats on the ships to be more meaningful, which causes a slight increase in the interaction between the players. The Director card also seems to allow a player in the ostensible lead to push the pace a bit too much towards the end game.

Transatlantic takes a number of aspects from Mac Gerdts's other games (e.g., the card play of Concordia; and the tableau building of Navegador) and combines them together into an interesting package. If you are a fan of Concordia, it is not a guarantee that you'll also enjoy this game. This game is much more complex than Concordia. 

The investment aspects and the hand-management are the dominant elements and a player will need to have his/her head wrapped around both to succeed in the game. The investment strategies are both apparent and subtle. Every player knows which ships are the most globally valuable due to the docks, so there's incentive to buy into the same ships. But there are only limited numbers of those globally valuable ships in the market, so good play not only involves smartly building your tableau but also manipulating the ship market (and the docks) to your advantage. You can also lessen the score of your opponents' ships by pushing them out fast and/or when there's no coal on a ship that is supported by trading posts. Each turn still plays simply due to the Concordia-style card play. In Concordia, you are primarily focused on the end-game scoring multiplier when adding a card to your hand. In Transatlantic, you are primarily focused on the action of the added cards. This causes the card play of Transatlantic to be much more interactive and thoughtful. Additionally, a session exhibits the typical subtle Euro-game arc. You begin the game focusing on generating money, but, towards the end of the game (assuming you were successful in investments and building your hand), money will become less important and point maximization will become the focus. 

I believe the above shows that there's some depth to uncover from the subtleties of this game. The more I think about the game, the more I find myself wanting to try it again. I just wish (a) the rulebook wasn't such a SLOPPY translation, (b) the set up time was a bit shorter, (c) the upkeep during the game was lessened so that playtime was a bit shorter; and (d) the production did a little bit less abstracting of the ship magnate theme. The colors of the ship cards could have also used a bit more differentiation -- the tonal similarity between the selected shades of black, blue and green tend to cause those cards to blend into each other. The icon mistake on the investment cards is kind of hilariously bad. The poor translation of the rule book into English is by far the game's biggest flaw.

These comments and my rating may be revised after a few more plays. I do want to explore whether a transport-focused strategy can keep up with the more natural ship purchase strategy. It may be that this game requires you to stay apace of ship purchases, while efficiently grabbing points from its secondary avenues.

Played Prototype demo'd by Mac Gerdts at LeiriaCon 2017: A well researched game about the development of shipping from c1865-1916. With flavours of mechanisms from Concordia, this is a very solid, well constructed game. Fingers crossed for delivery at Essen 2017.

First Play of production copy: A;though with flavours of Concordia this really stands on its own merits. Very nice game.

A long-awaited Mac Gertz' new title bought at Spiel 17.  Played twice and found it the same mechanics as Concordia. The pipeline-like board design makes it hard to visually grasp what has been built/developed throughout the game. Components' color scheme seems not to be thoughtful enough for those who have some extent of color-blindness (esp. for blue/green/brack ship cards).  The rulebook is kind of hard to read and digest the game's intention because of its lack of a good overview of the entire flow. Playing time is also too long (2 hours for 3 players) for the content.  Maybe my expectation was just too high -- I tried to like it, but couldn't.

This is definitely a Mac Gerdts game. There is a lot of balance and multiplying of scores and clever design elements weaved into the game. I'd heard comparisons to Concordia because of the card-playing to determine actions during the game and that is there. One aspect of Transatlantic that I like better than Concordia is how ships you own will score during the game as they are pushed out of different regions. All scoring in Concordia happens at game end.

Each ship has different traits which can gain you benefits when they enter regions with the highest value in one of those traits. We played the President variant which is, apparently, how the game was designed to be played. This means that you gain contracts for having the biggest or heaviest ship in a region and those contracts earn you other benefits. It didn't feel "advanced" to play with this variant, so I wonder why it wasn't just how the game worked in the first place.

I expect this game will be fairly well received, but I doubt it will take off. Mac's games usually don't... Concordia being the exception.

This game has the classic Mac Gerdts touch. Simple mechanics and quick turns, but a very fun optimization game under the hood. I love his other games Navegador and Concordia and I also found this one very fun. It is a mix of the card play from Concordia and the specialization/scoring upgrades from Navegador and Concordia. The turns play fast and there is a good amount of strategy in there. It is all about maximizing every turn you get and the card play is lots of fun with the ability to automatically play your newly acquired card. Another winner from Gerdts!

I bought this at Essen and had very high hopes for the game as I loved Concordia and its hand management mechanism - unfortunately I found this one way too abstract - the lack of a map immensly increases this feeling. Furthermore, the choices presented to players just don't seem to be meaningful enough for my taste and I do not really see enough potential for variation in future plays. Maybe my first impressions will be proven wrong, but there are so many great games these days that I consider selling this before it actually hits retail.

This is a really good game that feels like it falls just a bit due to it's fiddlyness. The scoring is cool, the interactions are neat. I wish the 'region scoring' effect wasn't effectively left behind as the game progresses, I thought it was very smart and interactive. By the time you hit a certain point in the game though, you're better off without it. I need to play Concordia again to compare as well. There's clearly a lot of similarity. But in the end, I felt like this was just a tad to physically complicated for what it was doing and I sort of just wish there was a board instead of a bunch of sliding cards.

TrAt is a card driven game in a two dimensional way. This time there isn't a map for your tactical decisions. But your choice of buyin ships are the most important thing there. And which colored flag you will buy in your fleet of ocean liners. The player aid and the german rulebook could be better. The Endscore Aid is printed much to small (eagleeye?) and the sentences in the book are not written in straight way, so you must carefully read some of them up to three times. The icongraphy on the company board is not brilliant done.The game drags a bit long for what it delivers. This has very few in common with Concordia.
I hope for a small expansion for example that 4 or 5 of the captain meeples have a special skill or that some ships have two flags or  that one area in every ocean has a heavy sea or extra revenue.

Really just a variant of Concordia. But with all these negatives:
1. No map for player interaction. 
2. You only go through your deck four times or so and then the game is over. 
And it really isn't as good as Concordia (which is a 8 for me). So why play this then?

A pale, very dry imitation of Concordia. The lack of a board and route-making really takes the tension out of the gameplay, and there are some very fiddly aspects (like moving ships around during deployment) that make the game more tedious than it should be.

I'm also not crazy about the end-game scoring, which only rewards the players who time their actions and money exactly to buy the last remaining high-scoring ships at the last minute. I did like the action cards and the combos you can set up with them. Willing to try this again to see if the opaque scoring becomes a little clearer to me with repeated play.

Found this disappointing after really enjoying Navegador and Concordia. I think the lack of any map took away from the theme of travel and the majority of the points come from scrapping your ships. I think you should be trying to get as much use out of an older ship and agonising over the scrapping point but here it's the main driver. Can't see any alternative routes to victory either, very mono-strategic. Shame.

A solid Mac Gerdts game but it doesn't live up to Concordia or Navegador to me. You can definitely see the influence the Concordia style card play and Navegador type scoring had on this one though. However, the game just feels so abstracted by simply playing ships into columns and there seem to be a bunch of fiddly rules and exceptions that could be improved with better graphical choices (i.e. remembering coal costs 50 is not on the invest card and the color choices are so close with no discerning icon for the flags). The decisions also felt easier since you never really felt short resources like you do in Concordia you just played a card that got you the most money or points each turn. It may sound like I'm putting the game down a fair bit I just don't see it living up to those other 2 games and like the decisions in those games more than this one.

I also like the President card and it's effect on how long one chooses to cycles cards as a counterpoint to Concordia, very neat.

Had really high hopes for this, as the pseudo-successor to Concordia, which I think is fantastic. Transatlantic isn't as good. With no board/map, there's no sense of space. With a limited number of spots for houses, they fill up fast, which leaves this odd feeling of trying to get VP where you already have houses, with little reason to focus elsewhere.

Mac Gerdts is an insta-buy! Purchased (and signed by Mac Gerdts himself!!) at Essen for me, and being shipped from Germany via Deutsche Bundespost, thanks Raphael!

After first, three-player game ...

Now, I am huge Mac Gerdts fan, so a little biased, but after our first three-player game we felt that there are a lot of little subtle interactions, and a need to identify key timing of best card plays, that make it quite an elegant game. While playing the first half of our learning game, it did feel at the start ... slightly repetitive in terms of actions to take. 

However, during the second half we found ourselves playing a bit more conservatively and thoughtfully. You could sense that the players were now making more subtle plays, thinking about how things were intertwined, for example: the combinations of flags on player ships, which ships were in dock, the building out of the player board, how to win those blue ribbons, what was the right moment to buy ships, when to duplicate, what A/B bonus action card might be the best to take or play at that moment based on what others were attempting, etc. Really enjoy the VP-driving mechanism where ships become obsolete and scrapped, if they can't be shifted to other regions. 

It became even more elegant to us as we played ... the way the game was going to score at the end as the composition of the dock changed and our own fleets built up ... we're all chomping at the bit to go back and try out more ways to play better.

We liked it .. a lot. I think there are a lot of subtle little interactions going on under the surface that make this an elegant game to explore much more. We enjoyed it thoroughly. 

Another excellent game by Mac Gerdts.

P.S. In terms of how this compares to another favourite of mine, Concordia ... it feels pleasantly familiar, but there's quite a bit different from it's predecessor in a number of interesting and subtle ways. It has been polished very differently, and once play starts, you immediately understand it is not in any way, simply another version of Concordia. The two are sort of like an emerald and a sapphire ... both obviously gemstones, but unique and beautiful for entirely different reasons.

Too dry, too repetitive, too long[/size]

[thing=163805][/thing], from the hand of the brilliant [person=6045][/person], has been in development for some time and anticipation was high.  The card play is straight from Concordia, but there the similarities end.  

In Transatlantic you are in a cycle of ship building, ship sailing, and taking income from your ships at sea thereby fueling another ship-buying spree.  The game is more or less that: buy, sail, take income, buy, sail...etc.  Rinse and repeat.  

The problem is that there is no arc within the game: there is not a great deal of evolution  - the ships just become more costly and your revenues grow.  And the game lasts over two hours, and really overstays its welcome.

A major disappointment.

The ostensible fun of the game is -- just as in Concordia -- chaining actions that synchronize well with the actions of other players. For example, each of your steamships needs coal in order to "transport", so you want to have coal when an opponent causes an area with your ships in it to transport. Think of the production action in Concordia only instead of you just getting goods when an area is produced, you have to have a resource loaded first to trigger it. 

The ideal situation is to load up one area with all your ships and buy some trade houses there too. Then have that region transport. All ships will produce income and you score ships times trade houses for a $ and VP double whammy. 

The part I found annoyingly fiddly is how you constantly readjust each area with new ships. And let's be clear, there's no theme here. The North Atlantic is simply a tile with 4 spots and "North Atlantic" written on the top. There's no spatial relationship to the South Pacific or the Indian Ocean or Philadelphia. 

Depending on the age of the ship, you might introduce it into the list of ships there and bump one out (it depends on the age of the ship). You're constantly looking around at ages of ships to see which ship could possibly fit into which area and, well, I found it kind of annoying and longed for the board in Concordia. YMMV. 

The rules were surprisingly sparse too which caused some confusion. There's no specific explanation that you add a card to your deck. The rule says when you pick up your cards, you immediately play one of the cards on offer in the market. That's it. We correctly deduced that it meant you play it and add it to your discard pile, but why not just add that extra sentence? Paying by the word, Mr. Publisher? 

I don't know, I see the allure of trying to chain actions and bump other people's ships out so as to introduce yours, dominate a region, and score in clumps instead of drips and drabs, I just didn't love it.

While Transatlantic uses the basic card play from Concordia the game plays very differently and unfortunately doesn't reach the heights of its ancestor. I miss the spatial considerations that were quite important in Concordia. Transatlantic has been abstracted so much that it I cannot quite shake the feeling of playing a spreadsheet, has reduced interaction, and adds lots of fiddly little rules and exceptions that make the game last longer without providing any additional benefits in return. It also seems like the strategic space just isn't as varied as it is in Concordia.
It doesn't help that the rules are spotty and the graphic design - not the illustrations, mind you - is lacking in places.

TRANSATLANTIC verspricht Abenteuer auf hoher See, versteift aber leider in spröder, hanseatischer Sachlichkeit. Dabei war der Seeweg des Spiels auf den großen Spieltisch ein langer: zweimal wurde die Veröffentlichung zu Essen verschoben, was meine Hoffnung auf ausgereifte Kunst und damit auch eine vermutlich zu hohe Erwartung nährte. Nun, ausgereift ist TRANSATLANTIC, aber eben ausgereift exceltabellig. Rechenschieberhaft verstaubt Mac Gerdts in TRANSATLANTIC in der Selbstkopie seiner Spielidee. TRANSATLANTIC wiederholt alles, was man aus seinen Spielen kennt. Aber die Wiederholung wirkt architektonisch und aufgebacken und lässt sich als Umdrehung von CONCORDIA, NAVEGADOR und Co erkennen ohne deren Reiz zu erreichen. Selbst das charakteristische Rondell, das hier wieder wie in CONCORDIA als Kartensatz zum Einsatz kommt, vermag der monetären Rechnerei keinen Odem einzuhauchen. TRANSATLANTIC hat keinen Glanz. Kein Hauch von großer, weiter Welt. Kein rauschender Pazifik, kein tosender Atlantik. Das große, weite Meer bleibt eine trockene, blaue Kartenablage. Das funktionierende Spieldesign mag isoliert betrachtet ja ganz okay sein, aber im Kontext der eigenen Werkschau wirkt es überraschend uninspiriert und taschenrechnerkomponiert, so dass alle das Gleiche machen und der Bessere der geldrechnenden Gleichen gewinnt. Da hilft auch nicht die schöne Schachtel und die wirkliche tollen, liebevollen Schiffe in ihrer Quartettspiel-Anmutung und das bemerkenswerte Beiheft zur Historie der Ozeanriesen. Vermutlich wäre TRANSATLANTIC in umgekehrter Reihenfolge im Portfolio von Mac Gerdts ein besseres Spiel, so jedoch bleibt es in der Onedin-Linie seiner Handschrift hinter seinen Vorgängern zurück. Dass der unsinkbaren Titanic auch eine Karte gewidmet wird, ist smart. Dieser Pop und etwas mehr Seemannsgarn beim Nähen des Segeltuchs des nüchternen Kaufmannspiels hätte dem Maschinenraum in TRANSATLANTIC gut getan. Ein Spiel geht in den Wogen der Neuheiten 2017 unter.

The influence of Concordia is strong here as the card play is almost the same but the game is simpler as there are fewer resources (money, coal).  The victory points are accumulated for shipping actions and points for ships based on accomplishing objectives.

Trans Atlantic (Concordia light)
Trans Atlantic is Concordia without interesting map and nice resources. Instead there are boring ocean spaces and paper money. 

That results in the game lacking the interesting resource management puzzle where some people get AP. That makes it a much easier game. The boring oceans also makes it less interesting but easier to play the game. 

It shares many of the mechanisms of Concordia with action cards that you lay out and a card to take them back. New better actions to buy. Production that produce for all on a region. 

A core element in Concordia is making a great engine and milking it. Just as in Concordia it is about making one or at most two places where you maximize production. In Concordia you always interact with other players, but in Trans Atlantic there are two actions that allow you to produce great amount of money with a single ship and no interaction with other players. Getting one ship and an action and milking it as often as you can is here much easier and less interesting. As you only need money there is no real need for anything else. 

The steam ships look good and have: colour, price, production, year, speed, weight and passengers. As the game goes on the ships get better and better. The values of all attributes increase so that you can always spend more money on a better ship. 
There is very little feelings for individual ships with no real character of the ships. Choosing what ship to buy is a quite interesting choice. You want to buy ships you can afford that will give good production but that will also give you lots of points in the end.

Transatlantic was a bit hard to wrap my mind around but pretty fascinating. I can see why it might disappoint fans of Concordia who either don't know or don't care for Mac's other games. It uses the card play of Concordia and the player sheet of Navegador to make another stocks-game-that-doesn't-feel-like-a-stocks-game like Imperial. This is exactly the kind of combination to excite me, but it might be a little dry for others. It's harder to see how the elements fit together than in Concordia.

It took me a while to see the stock elements, but they're there. Players are working with a public valuation of the stock (the docks) and a private valuation (their player boards) to get the most points. The twist is that players don't get to decide when to "sell" their stocks--they're pushed out by players. Just a fascinating game. I can't wait to play again.

I'm new to Mac Gerdts games so I wasn't sure what to expect. I really enjoyed it.
In Transatlantic you buy ships an try to keep them running for as long as you can. The thing is, newer ships will push them out so you need to keep that in mind. The card system is familiar from Concordia and it still works just as well, limiting your decisions per turn in a way that feels natural and easy to track. There's even added motivation to spend lots of cards before picking them back up.
You can tell the designer really cares for their history because every ship is unique, has lots of different stats and there's even a book inside with their stories.

I had high hopes, since Gerts did some pretty cool games in the past, but this one left me even colder than Concordia, which I didn't like much.

Well, to sum it up:

- it's fiddly
- it suffers from a bad overview
- there's only one way to victory
- the cards are not really special or interesting
- it's overly complicated for what it is
- more boring than fun (no highs or lows)

The game works of course, but it's not what I expected or like.

Feels like a mix between Concordia and Navegador, but VERY fiddly.
Like Concordia: Play a card from your hand and do the thing; a tribune-ish card lets you pick up your hand AND acquire a new action card (similar to acquiring Salsa expansion).
Like Navegador: Element of pushing other ships out of active area, collecting chips as a score multiplier.

Would like to try playing with the President "variant", as it gives more value/purpose to all those numbers on the bottom of the ship cards. Otherwise, you could probably just ignore those numbers and it not really affect your game. (ie: only a few cards/one board interacts slightly with them)

The Navegador elements seemed kind of weak compared to Navegador (your own ships being pushed out isn't actually a bad thing; most ships seemed to end up being worth a similar amount of points for everyone, etc). Will update review/rating after more plays.

I was really looking forward to Transatlantic because I adore Concordia.  Unfortunately, Transatlantic was a let down for me.  You hardly ever gain new cards so the whole game felt very much the same (play same cards over and over again).  Add the fact that there is no real board and overall Transatlantic just feels like a much lighter and less interesting Concordia.

Played once,   seems the game has only one path to victory.  and has quite a bit of "Take That". I found in my game, everyone was doing the same thing and vying for the the same spots. The first player had a huge advantage though the game makes no concessions for the last player.    The game is not as dry and themeless as Concordia. It is too long for how unbalance it is. I hate playing Concordia. I hate playing this game even more

RATING: 9
Rating based on five plays thus far.  

UPDATE:  After about 15 plays, I'm updating my rating and bumping this game up to a 9, which places it in my all-time top 20.  I just don't understand the reason for the relatively low average rating (7.3) compared to other recent games that have largely been overrated, many of which have been "one and done" for me.  Most of the other observations remain in effect, so the rest of my comment remains unchanged.

This is probably my favorite of the most recent (2017) crop of Essen releases, although admittedly at this point I haven't had an opportunity to play them all.  I like the theme, the historical information that comes with the game, and the smooth mechanics.  I probably prefer to its progeny, Concordia, for those reasons.  Think most gamers will prefer playing with the President's variant as it brings into play all the statistics on the various ship cards. Think this game is underrated vis a vis Clans of Caledonia, which I think is highly overrated right now.  (Keep in mind my initial impression is that 2017 might be a bit of a down year for Essen releases).

Only downside for me is the fact that three of the five colors chosen for the ships (black, dark blue and dark green) can be difficult to distinguish unless you have really good lighting, and there's nothing printed on the cards to help color-blind folks as was done famously with Ticket to Ride.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Same, same but different. Concordia is recognizable, be it in mechanisms, depth or target group. Again, a deck of cards drives the action and is slowly extended. It's uncoupled from the VP definition though. The VP definition takes place with a separate action which is reminiscent of the definition Gerdts has used in Navegador. The main VP source are the acquired ships that have the second purpose of earning money during the game. A change for the good as the deckbuilding decision in Concordia often was muddled by the dual VP/function consideration with function mostly relegated to second place.

The differentiating characteristic is the lack of a topographical element, i.e. no board. Instead, ships are arranged in queues based on their age. Newer ships push out older ones, introducing a constant need for Innovation; an elegant system. Various approaches are possible: focus on certain types of ships vs. a balanced approach, focus on running ships to buy more ships vs. maximizing VPs from each ship. Nothing can be neglected completely. As long as players perform their actions efficently, results will be similar. Another shared characteristic with Concordia.

For me it's on par with Concordia. I prefer Gerdts' Navegador and Imperial with their situationally shifting focus to Transatlantic's focus on executing one strategy efficiently.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I really liked Concordia. Turns out that a lot of that enjoyment came from the interactivity of the map play. The oceans and ships in Transatlantic don't come anywhere near providing that kind of interactivity. The result is a game that feels a lot more like multiplayer solitaire, but with no upsides to compensate.

Also, reading the manual gave me the impression that this would have some neat 18xx obsolesence/train rush feel. In practice it's just not there. The only thing that the aging mechanism does is cause a lot of fiddly moving of very old and irrelevant boats.

RATING: 6
The core mechanic itself feels very satisfying and addicting and playable with almost no downtime, but everything upon it feels just disposable and not really great fitting. It is an very ok game by playing it the first time, but i can's see any replayability. Big minus: hooorribly bad written and constructed rules with many unclaritys (for such an easy game and by PD, incredible) and just too many noob mistakes in designing and production. It could be a solid game with a 7, so it cannot be more than a 6. Bottom line: a "bad Concordia" nobody will remember and nobody really needs, because there simply already is a better game with that addicting core mechanic.

RATING: 8
Very nice game about the age of steam shipping. A pity that it only focuses on it and not more also on the awesome sail ships. But this is just a personal thing. More sad: Each sea region is the same, there is a clever game mechanism regarding the ship placement in them, but not any difference between them. So it only matters where you place your ship because it trumps the other ships in certain numbers but there is no real harbour difference, shipping difference etc. This is really sad. Still the game design is very well and the game worth it. Just a note what could have made a "9" out of this.

You cannot help but draw comparisons between this and Concordia and of the 2 Concordia is better. The play of cards is identical but instead of a board you are collecting ship cards to make cash and points. The game is a bit of a points salad with the scoring coming from several different places, buying key ships is crucial to doing well (Blue Riband) and creates odd stalls in the flow of the game. It is not a bad game it is just not as good as Concordia.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Transatlantic uses the same card mechanic than in Concordia. But there is no board, less interesting scoring and more "moving cards from here to there". All this and less interaction between players AND STILL almost same length. Result: not as interesting as Concordia although this is a bit different kind of experience. Still... I've to ask from myself: why should I play this instead of Concordia?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A nice design poorly realized.  The English rules are sub-par, the iconography is ambiguous, there are color mismatches, etc.  But the gameplay is deep and solid.  The card mechanics are reminiscent of Concordia (by the same designer) but the game state is a lot more readable & trackable.  The game end is also more predictable and palatable.  Because there is no map, the game feels more abstract than Concordia, but it's not really a problem for me.  The design probably deserves an 8.5, but I'm giving it an 8 given the current state of the product.

It's a nice game, but the Geram rules weren't easy to understand at any time. The English rules helped us in some points because they were clearer The investmenr card, has the variety of three actions, that can be chosen bei the player. Bute there a only symbols for two of them printed on the card and the symbols are neither easy to understand nor giving you information about the prizing of the actions. Furthermore there aren't enough markers ( freight, mail etc.) to complete all playerboards in a four player game, although the rules say: "Even if a column is full, more Blue Ribands or other markers can be acquired. They are
placed beneath the player sheet and count
1 additional VP for their respective fl ag."We had the problem thet the mail and pessenger markers ran out, with four players you would need 16 markers to complete  a colum on all boards, but the game included only 12 mail and 13 passenger markers. So we had to improve with markers from other games. Maybe PD can create a downloadable and printable file with more markers.

The first game had 4h of playing time. The second one with the same four players 2,5 hours. 

We are looking forward to our next game.

First impression after one three player game with director variant.  Mac Gerdt has been designing great game for some time now, and refining his rondel with many variations.  Transatlantic feels like a polished game, beautiful to look at and fun to play.  Strategic, more interactive than your usual euro, with small downtime (unless you have someone AP in group), a good pace, and relatively low rules overhead.  A great addition to Mac Gerdt stable, very excited to play it again, might rate higher if first impression holds wit repeated plays.

Played once. The card-play structure is indeed reminiscent of Concordia, the rest of the game is not. It's interesting but not great. The situation on the oceans changes too fast (with 4 players anyway) to make planning ahead worthwile, so it felt mostly about short-term tactics.

Game is exciting enough but feels very dry. Mechanism, mechanism.
The theme seems to be in the beautiful boat pictures, and history booklet that is enclosed, but not really in the gameplay itself.

Material looks a bit boring and can keep many away from this game. Action cards and board look so basic.

A game that will only appeal boardgame geeks.

Very long game (3 hours with 4 players) that is completely linear andstarts to feel like a slog after the first 75 minutes. You repeat the same series of actions with no long term planning. There are some decisions over which card to play at which time and when to pick up your deck, but no agonizing, critical choices that are hallmarks of the better euros. I advise sticking with Concordia.

Yes, I like this game. Card driven, in that sense a similar feel to it as Concordia. But Transatlantic is much more interactive, while still smooth playing. Ships become obsolete, that is a nice mechanism. At that moment they score points according to the built up multiplier tiles on your own tableau: a part taken from Navegador. All in all a very interesting game.

Bought this one blind for my love for concordia. The game is totally different except for the card play. The game is all about buying boats, making money and scoring them for points. More boats equals more money and more points. I feel the game lacks real interesting choices and different paths to victory. You buy the boats you can afford and put it in the region that works best at that moment. The cards you gain do not drastically change the game. After one game I was done with this one, no reason to keep this when I have concordia.

A nice variant of the Concordia mechanic. Lacks the spatial aspects and most of the interaction in Concordia, which makes this an inferior game. It's ok, and the art is lovely (graphic design could be improved), but the replay value is much lower than in Concordia. Concordia is a keeper, this one isn't, but I'm going to enjoy this until I sell this.

Huh. One play so far, which was not bad but also very frustrating--for a game from a designer known for clear rulesets, clean board design, and straightforward rulebooks, this manages to contain problems with all three. Bad visual design: good luck distinguishing dark red, dark blue, and black ships at a glance. The rulebook and setup sheet are a mess, and contain a number of errors and omissions (the setup sheet fails to mention that the initial ship buy occurs in reverse turn order beginning with the last player; the Region card says you get money from the oldest ship "of another player", but the rulebook just says "the oldest ship", which makes a huge difference i.r.t. the neutral Scotia ship). There are fiddly and hard to remember rules for ship deployment, redeployment and scrapping. Also, this is the first Gerdts game I've played that has one of my least favourite mechanisms--nontrivial out-of-turn-order actions that mean you have to keep careful track of whose turn it is. (When you bump a ship out of the region and it can't be redeployed, the owner gets a free transport action and then scores points--all in the middle of your turn.)

Oh yeah, another thing: the little green/red/white markers seem to correlate with the three ships specs--knots, tonnage, passenger capacity (they have those icons). Thus you would think they work like the privileges in Navegador, which reward acquiring the matching items. Nope! They are totally arbitrary and the only thing they do is boost the value of that colour of ship, regardless of the ship's speed/tonnage/capacity. One gets the impression that vestiges of earlier design iterations remain in the published design even when they are no longer functional.

That said, it's an interesting game, and like any Gerdts game moves quickly once you get the hang of it. (That said, the designer's usual practice of allowing up to 5 players is violated here to keep playing time down--it only plays up to 4.) The card market is more interesting than in Concordia, and the most innovative and welcome part of the game is the accelerated deckbuilding: unlike other deckbuilders where you acquire a card, toss it in the discard pile, wait for it to pop up after you reshuffle....in Transatlantic you get it and IMMEDIATELY take the action. (Furthermore, if players have the Ship Agent card they can immediately copy it!) 

My impression is that you need to focus on snagging Blue Ribands, as it's the only way to fill out your player board decently and unlike the other 4 types of bonus markers you can't buy a Blue Riband. Also, if you buy a ship of the same colour as the leftmost ship remaining (which thus is docked), you are guaranteeing that your ship will be worth more when scrapped/at endgame. -- Ideally you want to purchase ships in pairs for efficient use of the free "deploy" action on half the cards in your deck. (If you can dominate a region you can get cash back through a bonus transport action if you scrap an old ship of yours, creating a nice little chain.)

A lot to think about--I just wish you didn't have to fight through the messy presentation to get to the meat of the game.

Another great Mac Gerdts game! The formatting of the english rules are a bit of a mess, but otherwise the game is good. Mac Gerdts is quite good at making games with a very interesting strategic planing aspect whenever it is the rondel or the Concordia card mechanic that Transatlantic has. But the game is quite different from Concordia, in a good not bad way, although it is not as streamlined with Concordia's elegant rules. 

Once you see how the game works, the strategy is very interesting. What ship colors do you go for? Do you want the fastest ship now, or build up your passenger abilities? Maybe you try to build a bunch of trade houses and rack up the points that way. You want to do everything but you can't do it at once.

RATING: 7.9
Transatlantic is a mix of one thing I love: ships; and one thing I don’t like: a wash, rinse, repeat game. So I have mixed feelings about this game.
The rules could be clearer and the game mechanics work well and very smoothly once you understand how the ship deployment works.
In my second game, I decided to remove one ship from each of the time zones (1 to 9) to give a 3 player game set up for a 4 player game regarding ship numbers and used those ships to seed the Docks area. This worked really well as the docks gave players an idea of which ships to purchase and the reduction in ships meant that the game completed in 100 minutes. With further plays, I think we should bring it in around the 90 minute mark which is perfect for the depth of game.
I would always recommend using the President Card in order to provide more strategy during ships purchase and deployment.
The more I play this game the more I like it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Transatlantic is an economic game with the card driven action selection mechanism know from Concordia. You build ships to first earn money with them. Later you score points, adjusted by shares you got from the different ship types. Gameplay was ok but the actions did not feel impactful enough (ok now I have some coal...). We stopped the game early as the others I played with felt similar.

I liked the adjustment that you get an action card and immediately do the action when picking up your cards. But I disliked the whole “kicking out others” thing, it often felt mean or disrupted my plans. Concordia’s best part in my opinion is that you don’t know everyone’s points until the end and can play without frustration to the last minute. Lastly, I missed the game board, even tough the ship cards looked gorgeous.

2-6 players

To be published in 2017?

Stock holding mechanic

Game description
[q]Players invest in six historical Steam Ship Companies, which transport freight, passengers and mail around the world of the late 19th century. New type of ships are developed which carry more cargo, but also demand more iron to be constructed and coal to be run. 
Players are not only investors of the companies, but also industrialists running their own coal mines, iron works, and railways. They make a lot of money by selling coal and iron to the companies of their choice. Of course they want "their" company to flourish and to pay out dividends. But beware, the control of a company may be taken over by another investor...
The game starts with paddle steamers and ends after fast liners have appeared.[/q]

This was the original idea, before the game was redesigned. Not really interested in another snowball econoeuro.  Will wait for reviews.

I'm a big fan of Gerdts, so I'll assume that additional plays will help this one in my estimation, but this was something of a slog.

Card luck and and a midgame slowdown seem to be negative factors here...

I'm generally a sucker for games that come with a little history book to put everything into context. Transatlantic takes the map out of Concordia, and replaces it with a cute little economic engine, which is fair exchange. Playing with the full 'President' variant (hint: not to be regarded as a variant), there is also an entertaining twist on Top Trumps thrown in too. The biggest compliment is that the game feels smooth, natural and subtle, although the endgame scoring is a severe headache,

[COLOR=#FF0000]IN PROGRESS:

Initial thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]I feel the need to start my comments dispelling the notion that this is somehow a lesser version of Concordia. Transatlantic shares one thing in common with Concordia which is your actions are determined by the cards you play. And even with that the cards in Transatlantic do not have end game VP scoring conditions printed on them. Transatlantic stands on it's own two feet and offers a rich and engaging play experience. There is a lot of strategy to uncover in Transatlantic, you can not grok this game after one play and experienced players will definitely have an edge over new players. In my opinion that is a good thing, if I am playing a heavier game I do not want the strategies to be obvious. 

What really sets Transatlantic apart from other games of a similar weight is how clear and intuitive the rules are, similar to Concordia this is a relatively easy game to teach. The depth lies not in discerning a complex set of rules, but instead on crafting a cohesive strategy based on the timing of playing your cards. I appreciate never having to look at a rulebook to continually reference some obtuse rule or exception to a rule. I am really becoming a huge fan of Mac Gertz and I am really interested in trying out some of his older games. 

There is a fair amount of player interaction based on the timing of the actions you take. The timing of ship purchases is extremely important, wait too long you can really get hosed. There is also a card that will force you to transport your ships in a region and while you earn some money it could really mess with the plans you had for that ship. 

You also have control over which ship will enter the docks and therefore increase the scoring for a certain flag color. When I first played I wasn't even paying attention to that, but you actually have quite a bit more control over the docks than it may appear.   [/i]

Solid game. Combination of the card play from Concordia and the Score tablet from Navegador. There is quite some interaction in this game which makes it interesting. The 'copy' action card is maybe too powerful (just like with Concordia), but it also forces you to time your actions (which is very important in this game).

Solid game(10) ...different enough to be added to ones collection even if you own Concordia ...very well produced and great to read the enclosed history of all the ships used in the game ...rules are brief I had to reread on or two parts to makes sure I understood what was being explained no verbarage in the rules ...

I have played several 2player games and used both variants and we prefer the President variant and the reverse side of the purchase board where only 3 ships come into play with coal automatically ...game gets better and better each play...

Does it challenge Concordia well yes and no ...I like scoring system in this game very much but miss the geographical variety of Concordia ...
SERIOUS NEGATIVE (1) IS THE COLOUR OF FLAGS ...TERRIBBLE CHOICES AND 3 COLOURS CANNNot BE EASILY TOLD APART ...NOT GOOD PRETTY BLOODY BAD ACTUALLY ...come on guys why have you done this ???

In Transatlantic, players buy and operate 19th- and 20th-century passenger liners, earning money and points.  Once bought, ships are assigned to a port, possibly bumping off older ships.  However, if the ship that would get bumped off is younger than the youngest ship at another port, it is moved to that port instead.  While somewhere on the board, ships can be operated for profit, and points if a player has trade posts at that port.  The game functions via a card action system like in Concordia, and you can buy better cards to give you better actions.  Unlike Concordia though, the points are totally divorced from card purchases, are are mostly earned in-game through actions.  I enjoyed this game, but it felt a little dry and uninteresting--I felt like I was just doing things to earn points.  Additionally, I was a little frustrated by the ships getting bumped off mechanic, as it was very hard to predict or control.

It's only an initial rating after one play (and I was tired at the moment), but it felt like I was playing a spreadsheet instead of a game. Especially with the ages of the boats and how they move (which is sort of the heart of the game in combination with the deckbuilding), you have to be a sort of data-analyst to keep track of that.

Not perhaps quite as good as the same designer's excellent Concordia, with which it shares some important features, but a very fine game nonetheless.

This game uses a cards hand-building system similar to Concordia as an action selection system. It works well here, but has a very different feel to Concordia. Essentially players are either buying boats, or activating boats to gain money. Money lets you buy more boats, and so it goes. Slowly as the game progresses, older boats get edged out of the board, at which point they score points for you depending on how many tokens matching the boats color are present on your player board, plus a bonus for matching boats that got discarded from the conveyor belt of buyable boats. Once you've played five cards you can play your reset card to get all your old cards back, and then select a new action card to use from a belt of action cards which gets resolved immediately.

There's some interesting tension in the game as to how often you need to get new coal on your boats so that they can activate for money. There are also interesting points where you can buy a house above a boat spot which means you get some points in addition to money when boats activate, so how often do you buy those, vs saving for boats vs buying tokens for your player board to increase the value of your aged out boats. The process of boats getting pushed out of the slots is a little messy, and the rulebook for the game in english is quite poor, but this wound up being a pretty interesting experience. After my one play I don't know that I have a sense of what a good strategy looks like in the game, but I'm interested to see what I can do with more plays.

I will say that this game didn't punch me in the face with awesomeness like Concordia did. This still might wind up being a great game for me, but Concordia was love at first sight. This is something I'll have to grow into or away from. Another play or two will tell.

In my opinion, this is a more "steamlined" (streamlined) version of Mac Gerdts' most famous title: Concordia. Yes, the hand management and cardplay are mostly similar, but this game has an economic part as well. The bumping of ships and collecting points for scrap adds an interesting dynamic. The reason why I like this game more than Concordia is that it plays smoother and the scoring is more straightforward and out in the open.

First impression after 1 play: The card mechanism from Concordia (with some tweaks) is being combined here with the scoring mechanism from Navegador (also with some tweaks) and blended into a new game with its own look and feel. The fact that the basic mechanisms are not very new, gives the game something familiar, but the whole ship lifecycle management also presents a whole new experience in the MacGerdts line of games.

Bought like new from Facebook trade group.  I like this game quite a bit.  I like the card mechanic like Concordia, though you will likely only add a few cards into your hand throughout the game.  The copy cards are most valuable imo.  The historical aspect of the theme is pretty cool and the ships look nice on the cards.  I think several strategies could lead to victory and look forward to trying them out.

The game is fun and I prefer it over Concordia! Whereas in Concordia you're getting cards mostly for their VP multipliers (and having to remember which multipliers everyone else has hidden away in their decks), here you get the cards for their actions, and player multipliers are much more obvious on their player boards. You also seem to have a bit more control in the value of the different colors here, since you can try to push specific boats into the dock (which in itself is a nice decision point like in the SNCF games: do you take more shares for yourself, or make the shares more valuable?). 

I've since learned that the President card variant is actually the designer's intended basic game. Looking forward to trying that out, as well as the alternate market board (where coal is much scarcer)!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
The ship deck has 10 eras, each with several ships in random order. 6 ships go into the market. Players all start with a beginner sailing ship in a different sea region of the board. They buy one ship each from market, and place them into the same region as the sailing ship of the player to their left, with a coal cube on it.

Everyone starts the game with an identical set of cards. You acquire more later. Some cards also allow you to put ships in your personal display to sea, just before the card's main action. On your turn, play a single card to your discard pile and do its action, for example:
- Buy 1-2 ships from market (and discard the leftmost remaining ship to the Dock), placing one onto the board and the other in your personal display. Ships all show their year of production, and must be placed in a region sliding in from the top, only if it's newer than the current topmost ship (so region ships are always in chronological order). If no legal place remains, the ship may not be placed. If sliding pushes a ship down off the board, it moves to a different region if possible. If no legal place remains, it transports one last time (if it has coal), scores, and is decommissioned (removed from the game). One region awards the player a Blue Riband token if the ship is the fastest in that region.
- Invest, either building a trading house in a region with one of your ships and adding a red/green/white token (passengers/freight/mail), OR buying a coal depot token (added to your board) for 50
- Get coal (base value + 1 per coal token on your board), distribute to make your ships as evenly supplied as possible
- Transport: run various combos of your ships (e.g., some number of them, one per region, all of a color, etc.). Each of your trading houses in that region scores 1 VP.
- Director (or President?): Return all your discards to your hand. In addition, add a card from the display of 5 to your discard and activate it (discard a card from the display, then refresh display).

Whenever a ship is decommissioned, and also at the end of the game (all ships still on the board), it scores VP: a ship is worth 1 VP per like-colored ship in the Dock, plus a value based on how many tokens of that color show on your board (1/2/3/4/5 -> 3/5/7/9/10). At game end, you also score for tokens on your board: the nth row is worth 5n, scoring all complete rows. Each token in the next (n+1) row scores (n+1) VP.

I was skeptical about playing Transatlantic at all given all the bad things I had heard about it, but I think I enjoyed it more than anyone else at the table. This is damning with faint praise.

It's another spin on a few familiar Gerdts mechanisms. Cardplay is reminiscent of Concordia, and collecting tokens in the same colours as ships grants a score multiplier a la Navegador. Play consists primarily of acquiring ships and sending them to one of the oceans, where, Top Trumps style (assuming you use the designer's recommended variant), contracts are awarded if the ship is the best in that ocean in terms of passenger capacity, speed and/or tonnage. Ships provide cash and possibly some victory points when they are activated by transport cards; of course they need coal to operate. There are a few other sources of points but the vast majority come from ship bonuses earned at either the end of the game or when ships are retired.

Perhaps the best feature of the game is that one of the starting cards activates all ships in a region and not just those owned by the current player, offering some scope for incentive management.

I'm not a raving Concordia fan but it's undeniable that the map adds something to that game; Translatlantic is a spreadsheet with nice pictures of ships.

I had more negative things to say and we were all prepared to give it up after one play, but on reflection I think we probably played the first game in the worst possible way. Afterwards we said "investments don't seem to be worth that many points", the player with the most ships won a convincing victory and we wondered at the lack of player differentiation in the scoring tokens (e.g. I had 7-9 i all categories). But would it be different if we played again? Well, probably. If all players raced for ships, investing less would mean fewer scoring tokens and higher ship churn; specialization would be required to maximize ship score. The game would be faster and more of a race. It does seem like three players is probably better than four, too, because the port starts off seeded, there's less downtime and more money early (because of how region bonus cash is distributed).

I'm not too hopeful and I'm never going to like Top Trumps but it deserves another chance -- maybe I won't say no to another game after all.

tl;dr: dry but I like it

Ever since [thing=24181][/thing] any new title from [person=6045][/person] has been on my radar as soon as it was announced. This game was announced over three years ago, but I guess there was some tinkering to be done to get it ready for publication. But it's here now, and that's what counts!
In this game a big part of the puzzle is what ships do you buy, when do you put them on the board, and where. And when do you ship to get more money? Or do you wait for your ship to be kicked off and have an automatic ship?
The game runs on a card mechanism that comes straight from [thing=124361][/thing], but the rest of the game plays very differently. I guess the main reason for that is that the cards you have don't influence the end game scoring.
It is a bit dry, but I quite enjoyed playing this and working hard to get the timing just right.

Transatlantic is pretty interesting. It's a tiny bit of deck building and a while lot of action selection and hand management. I enjoyed my initial play, but I do wonder if the theme is too thin, odd (investing so that when you ship becomes obsolete you get more points for decommissioning it?) and, ironically, dry to make this a real favorite. Would like to try it at least once more to see how it holds up.

I'm a Mac Gerdts fan and I love Concordia, so when I heard there was a new Mac Gerdts game that was similar to Concordia, I was stoked. I jumped into this game off of a grueling game before it, so it wasn't the best introduction and I struggled with the rules explanation a bit. Maybe that colored my impressions?

Before I talk about the game itself, let's talk about the art and graphic design. It's got a pretty box, and the ship cards (although very dark) are pretty, but that's the only part of this game that saw any love from the artist. The "board" is just a series of blue rectangles with an ocean name at top. The cards are simplistic looking (and even have a typo where one of the three goods in the game is depicted with yellow instead of red). I really felt like I was playing a prototype version of the game. (Amusingly the images in the image gallery shows a bunch of versions with pretty maps, which apparently were prototype versions.)

Okay, on to the game... In the game there's a public board where ships come out in a purchase row, and then there are oceans below that where you can place ships. You have a personal board, which essentially just tracks how many upgrades you've done. Those upgrades determine how many points you score for each type of ship, and there's also some bonus scoring for each complete row of upgrades you complete.

You have a hand of cards, and there's a row of cards to purchase. Technically this is a deck builder, but you'll only add a couple of cards to your deck over the course of the game. If you've played Concordia, then the action part of the game is pretty familiar to you. You play a card and do it's action. Eventually you play a card to pick up your cards which also allows some bonus stuff if you have enough cards in your deck. When you do that, you get to pick a card from the card display, trigger it's power, and then it goes into your discard pile.

So what do cards let you do. First, you can purchase a ship, or two possibly. You pay the cost (including the premium beneath the ship which is higher for the newer end of the ship row). Then you scrap the leftmost ship. Finally you place one ship (even if you bought two... other cards will occasionally allow you to place a ship in addition to their main action) in one of the oceans.

Ships can only be placed in an ocean if the year on the ship is higher than the top ship in that Ocean. If the column of ships for that ocean is already completely filled, then the lowest ship in the column is forced out. If that ship has a year that's higher than a ship at the top of another ocean, it can move there, repeating the process. If not, that ship scores points for the owner and goes out of the game. The points you get for that ship depends on how much you've upgraded that color on your personal board and also how many of those ships have been scrapped (discarded from the purchase row (not knocked out of oceans.) Scrapped ships are kept in a separate area and each scrapped ship of a color scores gives an extra scoring point to every ship of that color.

There's a card that allows you to build houses/buy coal. Building houses lets you put your house on an ocean (which can score you points later) but also upgrades your personal board for some color (making those ships more valuable to you). Buying coal gives you coal and upgrades your personal board for black ships.

There's also just a flat out 'get coal' card, which gives you two coal plus more coal for every step you've upgraded coal.

There's also a card that lets you "run" the ships in an ocean. This means every ship in that ocean spends a coal (if it can) and pays out cash to its owner if it does. Payouts vary by each ship and are listed on the card. Additionally, the person who triggers the action also shares the payout of the oldest ship in that ocean (both players get the full value). This can trigger other player's ships of course. There are later cards that let you run your own ships from different regions. If you run a region (with at least one of yoru ships) where you have a house, you get a point for every house you have in that region.

Your last card lets you pick up your deck, and allows you to get a free upgrade if you've played x cards and two free upgrades if you've played x + 2 cards.

There's also a "copy another card" card.

Every ship has a color (blue, red, black, white, green), a purchase cost, a payout amount, a year, a tonnage, a passenger max, and a speed. The color determines a lot of how the ship scores. The purchase cost is the price (which will also include the premium amount depending on where in the purchase row it is). The payout amount is how much it pays when run. The year determines where the ship can be placed. The tonnage is relevant for some cards that pay out on a sliding scale depending on how much tonnage your ship has. There are other cards that score based on a similar thing for passengers. Having larger numbers on your ships for those means you want to get (or copy) cards that reward having high tonnage/passengers. The speed on the card is relevant for one particular ocean section where placing the fastest ship allows you to get a "blue ribbon" which is the only way to upgrade the blue color (and tends to be very contested).

So you buy ships, put them out, run them for money, so that you can buy more ships, rinse, repeat and you're trying to find ways to get extra money (like the special cards available in the card row) and make your ships more valuable before they get pushed off the board to score points.

At the end of the game any ships that didn't get pushed out (or that you were unable to play) score. Then you get points for all the completed rows you upgraded on your personal board (5 for the first row, 10 for the second, 15 for the third, etc.) and partial points for the first uncompleted row you were working on (1 pt per upgrade x the row level). If you completed two rows and then pushed some of the upgrades to the fourth level, only the third level scores partially (the row after the last completed row).

For a first play I was a little underwhelmed. The game itself seems fine, but nothing really special. The Concordia card mechanism wasn't anything new and didn't really stand out. There were some interesting bits, and maybe I'll like it more on subsequent plays, but it didn't really do much for me this time.

It also seemed to suffer from a rich-get-richer problem. One player in our play ended up getting a huge money bump from having high tonnage ships, which meant he could afford to buy more of those ships and then repeat the process. An early cash windfall in this game has the potential to set a player up and make it hard for other players to catch up.

I love Concordia, I truly do.
This is Concordia if Concordia were a so-so game.
The materials, the board, the layout, the colors: nothing helps playing the game. The theme doesnt help remembering the rules.
You have too many little calculations, too much handling, too fiddly things to keep track of.
Did I say colors are horrible? very nice but horribly similar.
After a few turns almost everything becomes rather clear but then the game is repetitive for too long.
Finally, it's Concordia all over again: this means it also lacks originality.
It works, it gives tension and tough decisions but... it's far away from Concordia

In fairness, this was unlikely to be my game. I was not a big fan of concordia nor did I find the artwork on this game particularly appealing. Finally, the theme of building some old ships was just not for me. Mechanically, there are several light deck building games that feel like they do much of what this does better. For my time, I’d rather play something like Lewis and Clark.

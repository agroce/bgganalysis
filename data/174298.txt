RANK: 4441
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
THIS IS THE TRUE SUCCESSOR of the famous NLB from 1976! I give it a 10 rating for to be my timeless favourite!!! - Test it with the Stumptner rule set and you will get another game out of it! So there you will have two choices to play a wonderful game set from Kevin Zucker...

Napoleons Last Battles on steroids.  Better maps, better OOB, better everything.  Having  played all the scenarios I could quite happy go back and play them again.  And the campaign game - the more I play this the more I wonder how Napoleon did as well as he did in 1815.

RATING: 8.9
Extraordinary maps, cards for friction, hidden units if you want fog of war, gameplay is the thing, Day of Battle or Campaign, top historical research: in short: A great, fun and promising game.

Negative point, it came out too late to celebrate 1815.

The grand campaign is something new in the Library system:  a 5-day experience of how a Napoleonic army works, from delaying actions to mass disengagements to set-piece battles.  Has it all.  The best entry in an amazing series of games.

Some wierd design choices made it hard to take this package seriously. Maybe I dont have the skills/experience to rate this game. Maybe it should be judged in comparrison to other games on the subject. I'm writing this from the perspective of someone new to the wargaming hobby that have mostly played gmt games. 

* Rules just struck me as bloaty / non concise / Ill-structured - spawning questions more than usual.
* TEC is printed on printerpaper, wo pictures, terrain types listed in no appearant order. 
* French troop setup printed with black on deep blue paper. Hard to read. 
* Expensive (I understand it might have to be as market is small).

Another great game in a great series. La Souffel is the perfect introduction to the series, being small and competitive.

RATING: 10
Simple mechanics, rules easy to learn, plays clean, allows player to focus on strategy without getting bogged down in rule searching.  Certainly the definitive treatment at this scale.  The relatively bloodless CRT and sticky ZOCs are indeed a bit throwback, but not distracting.  Lots of room to maneuver and almost endlessly replayable.

RATING: 8.5
IMO the great thing about TLNB is the scale, it is different to pretty much every other game out there, so that brings in a completely different feel. You are not fighting just a battle, as you do with a tactical game, and you are not just fighting the campaign, as you do with an operational game, but you are fighting both. 

This means you need to understand where the enemy is, use scouts to discover that and screen your own positions, get troops moving to the right place, manage march order, then deploy into battle from the march, and then co-ordinate all arms to win the battle. 

Then, if you win you need to get your cavalry together for pursuit and shake your troops back into formation to push them forward to take advantage of your victory. 

If you lose you need to gather the survivors, set up a rearguard, and extract as much as you can and try to form up a new defensive line. 

If it is a bloody stalemate you need to decide whether to keep hammering ahead or perhaps a flanking attack, always balancing time against losses and objectives. 

It's just a marvellous encapsulation of Napoleonic warfare at a level you are inexorably drawn into when reading really good books or accounts of the Napoleonic era.

NLG has the added benefit of the most famous battle in the era and a grand campaign.

Just to echo another comment, the great thing about TLNB is the scale. It's my first foray into the world of TNLB and I think the game is amazing. It's operational and tactical which in all my time playing haven't actually come across before. The components are great, the rulebook is well laid out and the ruleset easier to follow.

Slightly updated mechanics from the original 1970's game. The scale allows for some what-if manoeuvre scenarios and multi-day campaigns.

The single-six dice table makes the game results too random, and stacking and zocs create some weird feelings in my simulationist mind...

An outstanding rendition of my all-time favorite game (together with ASL, I know they are quite different :-). Having walked several times these battlefield(s), and even participated in the wonderful / almost glorious 200th anniversary reenactement, I can attest that the map is not only beautiful, but second to none in accuracy and historical feel. Wonderful counters, excellent rules, a simply EXTRAORDINARY game...
I really appreciate the addition of the extra North map with the great (and lovely, if so thick as to be sometimes dark) Fôret de Soignes  and, further North from it, campaign´s ultimate (geographic) target, Brussels. It gives Waterloo a whole new perspective...

Compared to its ancestor Napoleon's Last Battles, this is like buying and wearing a new pair of shoes. The updated rule set brings the game into modern times. A tremendous amount of research resulted in revised maps, expanded maps for more maneuver,  and orders of battle. The cards allow for great re-playability.

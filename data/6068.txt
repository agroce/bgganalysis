RANK: 1685

RATING: 6
Too many cards in your hand - which means too many cards in your opponents hand that you have to try and remember and I'm no good at that. The character cards add a nice bit of variety / tactics though
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I did not care for this one.  The luck of the cards can be really brutal, as the player in front of me was consistently able to purchase 3 cards where I was only able to buy 1.  Also, one other player collecting your type of gem torpedoes the whole round (and there are only three).  Some of the special cards seemed worthless.

Neat game: gather character cards and jewels, wtch the other players carefully.  -  With the ability to saturate the market with jewels you know an opponent is going to sell, or play the king to prevent their sale being worth anything. Only played with 2 so far, which is good but more would be better still. One the wife likes!

Not a bad little card game.   I like the devaluation mechanic.  Sometimes I felt like I was never getting good deals like the other players though.  Still overall I liked it.

I think this is a neat bluff system.  If I had a criticism, it would be that there's quite an art to getting the most from the Queen's Necklace, so most of the time it's overpriced.

Queen's Necklace is an interesting set collection card game with an economic element thrown in for good measure. The card sets and economics can all be messed with by using special power cards. These are the character cards (queen, king, thief, merchant etc.). The economic system is fairly basic but works well. You can raise or lower the value of specific gems based on how many are in play in a round. It all works well together. Some players criticize the character cards as bringing too much chaos to the game, but while they do add chaos to the game it certainly ties in well with the theme and IMO makes the game a little more interesting and not as bland as a straight set collection game. With more experienced players the chaos is kept in check to a greater extent. This is certainly an underrated game IMO and works quite well with a variety of players. It is however not a kids game. I think the artwork encourages people to write this one off as a light game. Quite the contrary however, the game has lots of subtle aspects that will keep a seasoned gamer engaged. And lastly, many seem to think that the theme is a bit too girly and they won't like it. The theme is actually taken from The Count of Monte Cristo. The flavor text on the character cards is all pulled from the book. I think the theme fits the game very nicely.

If you can get past the theme/art design, you'll find a decent game here...although it has a touch of typical "Bruno" chaos.  Not overwhelmingly, though.  An enjoyable game, but make sure you go through when the different cards are played before jumping into things.

[initial rating: 8.5] Played only once, but I really liked this one.  I'd heard some felt the game ended too quickly, but I didn't think so.  I love the devaluation mechanic, as well as the blind bidding for scoring.  I will admit, however, that the amount of chaos involved (In a Fadutti game?  How shocking) will probably cause my rating to drop a bit after a few more plays. [after a few more plays]  And indeed it has:)  Getting hosed on a gems bid or two turns out to be far too crippling, and the game isn't long enough to recover from it (though, again, I like that's it's a relatively short game - its length matches its weight)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
It's only 30 minutes, but I dreaded every minute of it.

Cons:
- Too many unique character cards which caused the game to bog down.
- Too many "Munchkin-like" cards.  Steal a card, steal the necklace, do XYZ to screw ABC player
- All or nothing scoring is very frustrating.  I knew a player had the King, and so I avoided playing ambers.  I played 3 Emerald with a ring and lost to 4 emerald.  I had 2 diamonds to 1 diamond, but then lost because he also applied the king to the diamond.  I literally had zero points going into the third scoring because of the all/nothing effects
- Card draws and how people draft and make the game unplayable for others.  For example players A and B ended up getting lots of high cost cards.  This meant that player C got lots of cheap gems and player D always had access to only cheap character cards, or a single gem.

RATING: 7.5
Every once in a while, there's a game that comes along and it clicks with some people.  This game was first played with my daughter when she was 5.  Why?  because the theme of course!  But to my surprise, she dialed in on the game play and actually learned to play the game by the proper rules.  She even learned to read the names of the cards and to look up how many of each there are (from the player aid cards).  Her strategies are not ideal (yet), but the game actually stands up to a remarkable number of strategic approaches.  And it is for this robust nature of the game play that it is recommended to give it a go.  Turns out that there is really a good game inside the theme and its been a pleasure to watch the daughter learn to play games better because of this one.

Was not interested in this game at all because...well, it's called Queen's Necklace! It even comes with a necklace! But if you can get past the girly theme, it's a pretty good game. It even plays nicely with 2 players (using some variant setup rules). Creates some tough decisions during the market phase. You really have to try and figure out what your opponents are going to play. It would probably get more play if it was a little bit shorter.

Fun little card game from DOW. 1 play with 3 players. Great bits in this one, even though my buddy wouldn't wear the Queen's necklace. This one is quite a brain burner as you're trying to gauge the relative value of the different gems. Can't wait to play again (always a good sign).

After the basics are gotten, this is easy for people to pick up.  Enough special cards to keep things interesting, and the sales are always tension-filled... but fun!  Plus the components are great for such a small game, but I expect nothing less from Days of Wonder.  I might even keep it long term, but a friend of mine really enjoyed the game... so this may become a gift.

There are some interesting mechanics here that you don't see in most games.  What I like is the speed at which the game flies by, it is almost like a filler if played with experienced players.  I also like the challenge of selling enough jewels to have the most, but not so many that you will negate the rarity of the jewels.  Unfortunately, the game can get a little fiddly at times, and it seems like it is prone to card counting which would spoil a lot of the fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Well, this took a few games for me to be able to digest.  I have to say, the bidding phase seems to be the most fun of the game, and it does happens the most frequently.  The actual sale is kind of overly complex; the rules are straightforward but the strategy seems kind of odd and the math is cumbersome.  I haven't quite grasped how everything fits together strategically yet; it seems like there's a lot of guesswork to it, but my winless streak implies that isn't the case.  Bad strategy during any one of the sales can pretty much immediately put you out of contention, which is also annoying.  All in all, a fun endeavour but the rules are somewhat of a barrier to getting new people to play.

Update:  I get the strategy now (buy rings!) but don't like the game any better.

This game includes some fun surprises with character cards that one also finds in its sister game, Citadels. However, careful planning in your set collection (gems) is still key to victory, with timely play of the King and Ring cards. The feminine lean with the game's theme should not detract from male players enjoying this Faiduti classic. It could just as easily be titled 'King's Court,' and probably would have more popularity. The necklace card is really only a minor part of the game.

I thought it was crap, but then again, I don't like many card games.

I'll play it if others reeaaaally want to play it, but that's about the only time I'd ever play.

Bruno Faidutti & Bruno Cathala (2 plays)  Standard great production by Days of Wonder.  The problem is that there is to much information, with 3 or 4 players, to remember.  With 2 players you just want to get the Cardinal and the Confessor to find out what your opponent has.  There is a great deal of chaos, just with 2 players, on when cards come up.  Maybe I take this one to seriously.  Light Filler.

This is a purchase-and-sell type game that's pretty simple and self-explanatory but somewhat random.  One's place at the table affects what cards one can buy, so a little bad luck can leave a person (or two) with unwanted or overly expensive choices.

This game has special powers to learn, but not too many.  Most of them are pretty straight-forward from the text on the card, with the Musketeer being the toughest to remember.  The game has a neat scoring system which keeps it interesting.  So far in most of our games, the necklace hasn't been overly powerful.  The actual necklace to wear was a fun idea, but we find it's not worth the hassle of trying to fasten it.

A set collection game where the sets are gems, and you score thrice during the game.  Whoever has the largest sets gets the points.  The trick is that the sets are laid out in secret, so there is an element of bluffing: do I want to play all my gems now, or save some?  Also includes typical Faidutti screw your neighbor cards.  Had more fun with four than with two.  Not a bad game, but I grew tired of it quickly and ended up trading it away.

This is a silly little game which is best played with two or three players; with four the balance between action and gem cards is lost. You require a good memory and a bit of a poker face to emerge succesfully. The problem I have with this game is that the sales are pretty much a crap shoot. There is almost no way to predict in advance which cards someone will lay down, even if you somehow manage to keep track of what your opponents collect. (Helped or not by an occasional peek.) The sheer number of cards sold off is not exactly helping either. If there's a seasoned card counter amongst the players, the rest don't have a chance; and you need to be card counters in order to [i]have[/i] a chance in the first place. These I think that you think that I think-games are best played in short rounds; with The Queen's Necklace there is just too much happening in between for mere mortals. The game material is great, and the subject fits the game nicely, but in practice it simply doesn't work as well as you would hope.

Yeah I liked this game, but I have Kingdoms and Quilt Show so nah. I let it go. The abundance of mechanics in this were a little too clunky and not streamlined enough with the I build an attack force thing and wear or steal the necklace. I don't know I don't remember but it was a mixed bag surrounding a fun core so... I just kept the fun core as repeated in other games and tossed this package.

We were playing it with only two players.

RATING: 5
Production: Great poofy gem tiles, nice gem cards, and nice illustrations on the cards.  Play: A fun set collecting game with the added pleasure of a Showmanager-esque purchase system, by which good decrease in value the longer they are available.  I will probably enjoy this title more when I am more familiar with the special actions on the character cards.  (2+1+2) (1 play)

I like this game alright, but it totally bombed with my wife.  Let me repeat that thought:

DO NOT ASSUME THAT YOUR WIFE/GIRLFRIEND WILL LIKE THIS GAME!!!  IT MAY GO TERRIBLY!!!

She hated the pasted-on theme, complained about how ungirly the necklace was, and never wanted to play again.  Traded away.

RATING: 5.4
The instructions are not clear and the players aids don't help much either. There's a game here but it is ruined by the crappy instructions. Also, it's had to see the point trackers on the cards because the score is small and the rinds are elevated blocking the numbers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This rating may change but:

The game seems flawed (second 2015 edition). The earrings card, for example, is a huge game changer that is difficult if not impossible to combat. In fact, the way luck can stack the cards in this game (especially in a four player game) can really make for unmanageable "competition."

In most of the games I play, there is a runaway winner that it is pointless to try to catch after the second sale.

Some of the balancing rules, such as fashion/versus commonness of the jewels seems like interesting balancing acts to try to manage in the game, but don't pan out as such in actual play- the limits of your cards and what you can do, and how simple it is to surprise another player with an initial 4 card starting hand (can have earrings, pearls, queens necklace, etc.) means the game can be a fail right out of the gates.

Will try again with house rules to see if it is better: only gems in initial hands?

Pretty disappointing. I think the game rides on its art and presentation, not its actual play.

This game is a pretty cool game that has a little too much fiddling in it.  Namely, you have to reduce the cost of each card after each turn by moving a ring down on each card.  It is a great mechanism, and the game is actually quite good, but this fiddly aspect keeps it from getting a higher rating from me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I've played this a few times now and find it has quite a bit to it. There is a significant luck element but there are also strategies that that you can play depending on the cards you find yourself with. I suspect that a card counter would have a significant advantage.

Liked by youngest daughter, but I can't convince anyone else to play.  Doesn't seem to work great as a 2-player game, and my daughter has a hard time holding onto the large hand of cards that develops between auctions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I'm not a big fan of blind bidding in general but it's ok here. I like the twist that you want to win auction but at the same time want as few jewels as possible of that type to be played to get the biggest rarity bonus.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I like the falling prices mechanic, and in theory that supply/demand should fix any imbalance of the cards.  But games are so heavily dependant on the Rings and the Favorite that the problem then falls on not ever having a chance to buy the cards because of who flips them.  And besides that, the game just falls flat.  Very silent game until time to count the gems.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Set collecting game where cards are purchases from a draft of five available.  Anything not purchases becomes less expensive for following players.  At three times during the game a scoring round occurs where players secretly declare gems and hope to attain a scoring majority.  Lots of Faidutti chaos abound, but this one sits quite well with me.  Lovely components.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Too much of a memory game, and too random with the card draws (with powerful special actions) and simultaneous everyone-pays blind bidding.  I could actually see this getting better after a lot of repeated play, when everyone has a good feel for how many gems to sell, but I don't feel much urge to get over that hump (and no likely opponents).  I might be more willing to try it with open holdings.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Cool actions on many cards and great theming. Some great elements that remind me of Taj Mahal, one of my favorite games. But the game has a lot of boring buying phases that culminate in a high-stakes guessing phase. A faster way to draft cards would help, as would getting rid of the blind bidding.

I really dislike games that have numerous special powers that interfere with long-term planning such as cards that allow you steal from another player, cancel scoring of certain gems (only four in the game), and peak at another player's hand.

Here's Faidutti again with the character cards with special powers! The price mechanism was good, but I constantly felt that I was missing out, and some cards seemed a little imbalanced. Overall, I felt that the luck of the draw played too big a part in the result. Richard got to the third sale with a massive hand of cards, but strangely held a lot back, meaning that amazingly I won two sales and tied the game with Mike (I could have won a third, but that was cancelled, and Mike had the necklace so Rihcard had to give him ¬£50 which tied Mike with me!! So basically Richard could have walked it and totally screwed up the ending.) A lot of text on the cards but it's not unplayable with a crib sheet, but that would detract a lot from the game play, since you keep having to check what the characters can doo anyway (some offset the others). Hohum. **** Played it again and this time, I got shafted. Every round, the cards re-set before my turn, so I only ever got one card, next play got two cards, next player got three, and back to me and everything is full price again. I did win, but mainly through the other two players fighting each other. I'm marking this down to 5.

Played 1 time. I like character powers in Bruno Faidutti games more than most gamers, but even I didn't like this one. A good idea for a game, but nearly impossible to play well because of all the action cards that mess up celever plans. Felt very chaotic to me. Shame since the game has such wonderful graphics.

RATING: 6.5
I would rate this higher if it didn't have so much memory.  You won't play this game very well if you don't remember what players pick up and what they play--and there are a lot of cards.  I like it for the medium-light strategy.  And the mechanics of how the cards get cheaper is nice.  It is short, a filler game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I like the decreasing costs idea.  The set collection aspect works well.  The utter brokenness of some cards is what kills it for me.  If a game hinges on having drawn or access to one particular card, that game is for a crowd which I don't belong to.

I don't get the hype.  A lot of people like this game, but I can not wrap my brain around how to do well.  I guess I must need to play it a few more times -- the times I have I felt like there was very little choice that mattered in the game.  It is fun to see one of our burlier players wearing the Queen's Necklace.  I do like the art, and the gold ring game pieces.  And, as mentioned, an actual necklace!  :)

RATING: 7
A couple of clever ideas, neat theme and great art. However, I think this game doesn't really allow for much choice. When it's your turn you usually can only select between 1 or 2 groups of cards. Addind the fact that there are only 3 (quite chaotic) scoring rounds, the final result is somewhat a die toss.

I don't like how almost all of the action takes place during the three auctions, how the hand sizes get so big. I'm not sure about whether or not I like the balance of trackable information in this game either. Besides a few actions that let you secretly draw a card, only your starting hand is secret. It's also annoying having to constantly place the little rings on top of the cards as new ones are flipped over. The components look great however, and some players might like this tactile experience more than I do. Sold in 2016.

The large, splendidly-illustrated cards and tiles make Queen's Necklace fun to play, even if the game itself is rather average.  The outguessing decisions related to bringing jewels to sale are interesting, but the remainder of the game is unengaging.  I don't feel like I'm making very many decisions during the purchasing portion of the game; the items decay in price so quickly that I'm mostly just buying whatever falls into my lap.  Also, the fiddle factor is way too high with the need to adjust all five of the little metal rings every damn turn.

Seemed okay, but in a three-player game the same person kept getting the good deals, another player got okay deals, and another player always seemed to get almost all expensive, new cards.  It didn't seem properly balanced for three.  Maybe two or four.

RATING: 6
There are some neat elements to this speculation game, but not enough to make it stand out. Players compete selling gems. Each turn players may spend action points for cards, and those that are not bought become cheaper. With careful card-counting, the game could be considered pointless, but certain cards give special abilities that help mitigate this. A somewhat similar game that I would recommend much more would be Die Fugger.

It is basically a majority game, with an interesting "sales" mechanism, and a well done system to determine the value of the goods (gems): a random (initial, so planning is possible) draw + a simple "the less common is the more valuable" (the rarity depends on how many pieces of each gem are proposed by the players).

Not very predictable (action cards that affect the game continuously) and controllable (bluff factor), but enjoyable.

Only played with 2, probably gets quite random with more...

I don't like set collection games in the first place, and this has a lot of randmness to it.. like what cards are there for you to buy at what prices, because some cards are just really better than others (mothers) ;).

So no, wouldn't play this again.

This quick-playing interactive set collection card game has a lot of angles happening in a short period of time.

Players collect sets of jewels for sale in 3 auctions. At the same time they may buy personality cards which enable them to reset the popular values of the jewels, steal jewels (or prevent/reverse theft), get additional cards, or make additional sales, even devalue sales of certain gems.

Only the players offering the most of a type of jewel win an auction- but the gems that are the most common have lower scarcity value, so how much do you need to offer to win the sale and still maximize profit?

A nicely-balanced little game- don't know why I haven't played it more already. I started this at a 7, and won't adjust it yet, but this trademark Cathala/Faidutti game is a keeper.

Meh. I didn't hate this, really, but I wasn't impressed, either. I liked the price development mechanism - at the same time, I thought the balance between jewels and persons wasn't great (I would have preferred more jewels in the game). Maybe this really works better online where it might run faster. 
The rules for the German Days of Wonder version are abysmal, by the way. Plenty of ambiguity, and at least one missing passage as well.

Excellent light-medium card game.  Plays quickly, has very little downtime and is just plain fun.  The components, as you would expect, are up to DofW's normal high standards.  The oversized (tarot-size) cards are a great touch.  (The queen's necklace is pretty cheesy, though.)  However, the artwork, design and theme are as good as any game I have seen.  This is a great game.  Go get it now!

An ill-advised attempt to turn a card game into 'pinkware' and make it appealing to women (the rule about wearing the queen's necklace is particularly absurd given that 80% of gamers are male). The perception that this is a "girls' game" meant that it took me a long time to get it to the table, but when I did it wasn't special. The combination of blind bidding to win a category and many special power cards meant lots of chaos. A shame given the high quality of the Days of Wonder components.

Just no. It's a blind bid where you all pay your bids win or lose. Horrible idea. The little rings are fiddly as shit. Half the rules are for 3 cards that don't really matter. Due to the rarity adjustments, all the gems end up at average value at the end anyway.

If you really want a game with a theme of jewelry, then consider this game. Otherwise, just avoid it.

Got a chance to play it a bit more.  I have been less enamored with it for that reason.  I still think its a really good game, just not as high on it as I once was.  Dropped a little more, but this is where it probably belongs.  Played with my son and daughter not long ago.  Still fun.

I've played this twice, once in 2005 and once in 2012. Had the exact same reaction both times. Pleasant enough game, lovely components. But gameplay boils down to card drafting a la Ticket to Ride, but some of the cards have special powers, and it all leads up to . . . three blind bids that decide everything. I don't dislike blind bidding the way many gamers seem to, but neither do I see the point in dressing it up this much. And I think that to do well you need to count cards, which seems counter to the light fun chaotic affair the game presents itself as. I'm usually annoyed when Serious Gamers over-analyze/suck the fun out of what's supposed to be a lighter game, but in this case I just can't help myself.

RATING: 7
A light fun game that plays fairly quickly (I like that!). My seven year old daughter picked it up fairly well and beat my wife and I on her first game. Some cards are quite powerful but I felt there were enough counters to their powerful effect to prevent the game becoming too chaotic. Components are all gorgeous. Lack of a scoring track seems odd though.

RATING: 4
Am I too harsh? Well the game works well enough but really doesn't do enough to warrant coming back to it. As usual for the designer it is random and chaotic a lethal mix together for any game and this one also doesn't offer enough choices. 

Now there is a LITTLE planning and card counting would help you here, it also plays quick and has a short enough playtime however the game started out a 6 for me and after 15 minutes got boring and degraded to a 4, ultimately forgettable and won't be suggested given there are so many better games 

Probably better suited for faster online play

Initial Rating: 5.0 (January 2017)

I finally played Queen's Necklace. It was better than expected, but still it is not my kind of game.

The rules are easy to teach, you can do it under 9 minutes. Playtime is around 50 minutes.

The theme is ok, I like Dumas¬¥ work, but still, you don‚Äôt feel it through the game.

The game¬¥s art and components are good. Best with 3 players.

The gameplay uses a devaluation mechanism that is kind of cool, however, the game¬¥s decisions are rather simple and, often, obvious. Luck plays a significant role (a minus) but there is still room for some clever play. Memory also plays a significant role, a plus to me. The most interesting decision is deciding how many gems to sell while trying to outguess your opponents, the rest of the game is bland and boring.

The player who score the most points in the first round, becomes the target of all other players and can have a hard time winning the game. I have come to dislike this ‚Äúattack the perceived leader‚Äù mechanism. Another minor minor issue with the game, it is annoying to constantly move the rings .

The card ‚ÄúQueen¬¥s Necklace‚Äù, is very powerful and perhaps too much powerful with 2 players so I‚Äôm worried about the cards balance. It seems some of the cards are much more powerful than others and it is luck if you can buy them at the right time or not. With four players the game is way too random and you cannot plan ahead. It is pure tactics.

Bottom line, Queen's Necklace can be a good family game, but there is too much luck of the draw with the cards and the decisions are way too simple for us. It was a bit boring. I will sell the game soon.

I'd like this to hit the tables a few more times before I rate it.  Thus far I've liked it a lot...this last game though showed me a potential for a rather large flaw.  I want to play through a couple more games to make sure this was a fluke as opposed to the norm.

Fairly fun game in which it helps to remember what cards others have picked up.  The devaluing purchase price mechanism is a nice one.  It is a bit harsh when you lose gems even when you don&#039;t make a sale, but does add to the tension.  I&#039;ll play again, but in no rush.

To play this game competitively you'd need to be pretty good at memorizing what others have purchased. If you aren't, the scoring rounds become a bit of a crap shoot. Take advantage of the cards that let you look at others' hands. The trick is in knowing how to use that information. It can be a bit difficult to decipher at first. The good news is, if you don't take all of that very seriously, it's a pretty enjoyable game anyway.

wow this game is just complete randomfest. 
-starting hand is random , you can get 5 crap jewels/character and another players 5  great jewel/character. this is beyond stupid starting hand rules. 
-its random what cards you can actual "buy" based on what comes out on what cost. 30% of the deck isnt even purchasable on the initial cardflip
-completely random scoring based on rarity but in higher player counts this is all random. 
-game almost plays itself because you pick up the highly discounted cards almost everytime based on the previous person pickup. 

lastly it has the worst scoring mechanism ive seen in a long time. In a 4+ player game its beyond luck what jewels are going to be rare or not. also the multipliers are too powerful and based on luck. for example in one round i had diamond at 3+0 for 6 points and next round my opponent scored 3+3 for 12 points. based on nothing but randomness of what jewels people are deciding to sell that turn. 

worst of all is the instant lose card "queens necklace". if by chance this card hits you you auto lose because its a swing of 10 points. Yes its random that it occurs but it happened to our group 2 straight games and adds randomness to already a random crapfest. you cant have a 1 card 10 point swing card in a game that the winner scores are between 20 and 30.

you could consider this game one of my "guilty pleasures."  I mean what guy wants to admit they like a game that looks girly, is about making jewlry, and is called "Queen's Necklace."

The "silent bidding", the cost of cards, the way points are determined by popularity and rarity, all the mechanics are great creating a product that is greater than the sum of its parts.

This was a surprise gift that I got for my birthday. Only played once but I thought it was pretty good. Reminded me a little of Alhambra. It seemed more "girlie" reading the rules than it actually is. (No way I'm wearing the Queen's necklace, however. :-)  )

Kind of a relaxing game.  When I try to figure out what makes it "relaxing", I guess I mean laid-back, which kind of implies that the choices are pretty simple to make (they usually are - just buy the best/most cards possible) and there isn't too much tension other than the second guessing in the gem sales.  I like the more feminine theme, especially wearing the Queen's Necklace.  I'm not a big fan of having to move the rings down after each player, sort of similar to having to move the cards in Showmanager/Atlantic Star.  I think that this could be a good family game, but among gamers I would prefer Fist of Dragonstones or Citadels, which have a similar feel, but are more exciting.

A clever game by the two Brunos. Although the rules may seem a little overwhelming for what it is, the game actually flows very well. It relies quite heavily on memory as it's very useful to remember which cards have been picked-up by opponents. The appearance of a merchant signals the start of a serious brain burning phase where you try to evaluate the best proposition according to what happened previously. And when the cards are finally overturned, it's often to uncover some nasty surprises. 

Although the cards and components are very nice, after a while it becomes a little tedious to "devaluate" the cards on display using the little rings. 

Best played with 3 players.

This seems interesting but the rules for the counting and scoring of gems are not really clear and the examples don't really go into why things are scored like that. For a game with such a small number of rules the rule book is large (mainly due to explanations of special powers - most of which are obvious) but lacking. Distracts from the game when you don't really know what you are aiming for.

Perhaps this rating is not entirely fair. The game is clearly targeted at young girls, which describes neither my wife nor I. Actually, my wife liked it less than I did. We bought it thinking "great, a 2-player game from Days of Wonder, how can we go wrong?" It just didn't click with for us. The game play is a bit busy, having to move markers on the cards with each turn, although the dynamic of having the cost of the cards change with each turn is interesting. The scoring rules (with popularity and bonus points) are a bit strange, but add another interesting dynamic. We thought that there are way too many special cards to play. We also didn't like the bidding war for the jewels very much, although perhaps with more experience it would be more strategic. In the end, the game just wasn't for us.

A very unique and interesting card game. I especially love the de-valuation phase and will often try and convince others how good one card is so I can then get the card I really want for even less!

Hey, don't laugh!  The court intrigue in this game is fun for group play and it came out long before Dominion: Intrigue.

RATING: 6
While I've always been somewhat put off by the theme of this game, the overall gameplay remains incredibly solid.  The favorites-vs.-rarity mechanic is quite unique and plays extremely well within the game, in addition to inviting some very interesting strategies not found in most other games.  There are a lot of cards which can (and typically do) affect the sales, and that was somewhat off-putting for me since there was virtually nothing I could count on.  However, the strategies start to reveal themselves pretty quickly, which makes it a very easy game to learn, and you always feel like you always have a chance to win.  Overall, this is a very enjoyable card game with a surprisingly deep amount of strategy that depends almost entirely on when certain cards appear, making each game feel unique.  While it may never really make it into my list of "must play" games, I expect I'll always be up for a game.

There is more strategy to this quick-playing game than people admit.  It is not about who gets the Queen's Necklace or who gets however many Kings.  It's about playing your cards to the best of your ability and keeping good track of what people purchase.  There are a lot of mind games possible and this is one of the rare games out there that is really good for three players.

RATING: 5.5
Not terrible, and in fact I quite enjoyed the economic system. Felt that there might have been a tad too many characters for the number of jewel cards, but maybe that's just me. My biggest bone of contention was the blind bidding aspect for the scoring rounds, which gives everything to the winner and nothing to the other players -- but they still loose their jewels. I'm really not a fan of "I think you think I think games", and would say that this definitely falls in that category. Now, if the game had more of an "area majority" slant, with the gem cards owned by the player face-up... I think my rating would be much higher.

Although I like the basic idea of the game I find it badly executed. I've played twice with four players and the game seems very random to me. With four players there do not seem to be enough gem cards in the pile to execute a meaningful strategy (e.g. spending gems simply to change the rarity is pretty much useless since it is too costly). The game also doesn't have an in-built mechanism to keep the number of cards you bid secret, nor does it have a scoring-pad.

Each turn, use your allocated 10 gold to purchase gems or personaities. Later, at end of round, secretly allocate the gems you would like to sell; if you have majority, you score the current worth of gems. If you like Bruno Faduitti games, you'll like this one. As a strategy game, well, it's just okay. Sales can be cancelled, gem values can be lowered, thieves can steal cards, some doublethink perhaps when you decide on how many gems to lay out. It's probably the most palatable of all the Faduitti games.

Agreeable art and quite quick for what it is.  The rings and scoring could be considered fiddly and time-consuming at first, but the game does not suffer from it.  There are far more time-consuming and complex scoring systems , and far more counters to shuffle around in games out there.  Pretty fun game, even with two.

UPDATE:
The confusion of the scoring system and the fact that there's so many good card-based games out there, has phased out this game a bit.

A pretty weak game, relying mostly on scripted card powers and generally uninspiring "economics".  Throw in the unusually powerful "King" card, and the game feels pretty random and boring. I won't call it broken, but it certainly borders on it.

It however does not appeal to boys...especially the part where the keeper of the queen's necklace card must wear the girly necklace! Even guests choosing a game to play pass this one up every time! The collecting of gems...saving them for all 3 sales or selling them right away to try to make the highest profit is a great game mechanic! The purple and red people cards are really well balanced to game play! The bits...like the golden rings marking current card cost are truly great! Super fun card game with excellent replay ability!

There's a lot of mind games and attempting to predict what other players will do, both on an individual turn and in the 3 sales rounds.  You feel smart when you predict how the round will go and either win the jewels you thought you would or thwart the sale or value of someone else's gems.  You can also occasionally crash and burn when someone thinks differently than you do.  I almost always enjoy these types of games. There are quite a few options and possibilities, and even when you know them cold, they come out in different order and combination, making the game stay fresh.

On a continuum of games that I am familiar with and that require predicting player-created chaos: TransAmerica is way on the lighter end of the spectrum, this game would be in a light/middle weight section with Modern Art and Metropolys, and Chicago Express would be on the heavier/middle weight area.

Wow, you put all that effort into choosing and investing wisely in cards, keeping track of who is collecting what, and then the scoring is completely dominated by the luck of whether your competitors decide to play their cards this turn or hold on to them until next scoring turn. Which turns an otherwise somewhat attractive game process into a bit of a lottery and a dis-satisfying whole.

Commodity Speculation

I think might be better with more players, but 2P is perfectly fine.

I really liked using the forger at the end of game to discover my opponent had ZERO amber, which I had early manipulated to be the most fashionable. Knowing this, I only had to put down one to make it the most rare for the most points! Its combinations like that which allow you to manipulate the game to your favor that make it fun.

Light filler. You're collecting gems that you hope are fashionable. I wasn't terribly impressed... I played pretty randomly and didn't pay any attention at all to what other people were collecting and still managed to pull out a victory. It seemed like an okay game to pass the time, but really there are so many better games out there that I probably wouldn't pick this one up again.

Great game with a lame theme.  This game is a fairly fast paced card game with an interesting bidding and market place mechanic.  I suspect if the theme was something other than collecting/selling jewels to the Queen this game may have been much more popular and perhaps even a runaway success.  Don't let the name scare you off, this is a great game in disguise.

I'm hooked!!  Kudos to B&B/DoW for this outstanding release, and the online version is just incredible!  I smack anyone who says there is too much luck involved (yeah, there is some) or it's too chaotic (I thought this when I first played)...all sorts of new strategies unveil everytime I play.  My rating has since dropped because there is too much bluffing & memory needed.

My only complaint, and it's minor, is that it's sometimes easy to forget to move the cost rings.  Also, the necklace doesn't really look all that good on me.

RATING: 6.5
Quick-playing card game with a very clever market system. Involves loads of bluffing & out-guessing your opponents. Lots of different tactics to try so this is likely to improve with repeated plays.

Very nice components including over-size cards, chunky cardboard tiles and an almost completely unnecessary necklace!

Reported to be at its best with 3 players, though still good with 2 or 4.

eric @ DoW - comments on improving 2 player game
"Yes, you could remove 4 amber cards, 2 1-gem cards of Emerald, Ruby and Diamonds, and 1 2-gems cards of of the same. This has the net effect of making the game somewhat tighter and reinforcing the importance of the characters play, more like in a 3-player game. At least that's what I do. I usually also remove the confessors outright in my 2 player games"

Played straight after Alhambra, and found both felt very similar, using the wertung cards for determining when to score, majority getting the points, using money to purchase the means to get certain majorities. How these same elements are implemented differ of course, but I found Queen&#039;s Necklace alittle fiddly, and maybe a little too much chaos for my taste, though it does make for alittle more fun and interaction.

It can be really hard to score in Queen's Necklace, especially to score well, so let non-gamers know they could be in for a tough time. That said, there's a reasonable amount of room for good tactical play. Card reveals can go against you with more players: a great card comes out but it'll be cheap before your turn, so someone'll buy it, but that's a nice mechanic overall. The take-that element has a fair chance of backfiring, so caveat rex!

RATING: 7
Only one two-player game so far. Rates a weak 7, whereas it's probably a strong 7 with 3 or 4 players. The rapidly changing fortunes and no 'partial scoring' of 2nd place makes real planning moot with a feeling of over-riding luck dominating. A 3rd or 4th players seems essential for the wicked ebb and flow of the game, but the luck element/randomness would only increase. A 5th player would be just too much to tolerate.

I like most of Bruno Faidutti's games. Citadels has to be my favorite but this one also exceeds the requirements for a good game; Great player interaction, lot of fun for the time you have to invest, great unique mechanics, solid theme, good looking components, easy to learn hard to master, good level of strategy.
My only complaint is that sometimes a player sits to the left of a dumb buyer who buys cards at a high cost and allows the next player to buy 3 - 4 cards at once and you have little chance to win in a sale round thanks to dumb buyer.

RATING: 8
There is a learning curve on this one (2 to 3 play) as it _very_ important to know the special cards and memorize where certain cards are (kings, alchemist, musketters ...).
There is very little chaos once all the player know the cards.
Very good in my opinion (but several in my group did not like it at all after one play).
My advice : play only with 3 or try the online version (beautifull) before purchasing.

It's not too much for my 4 year-old to play as his own player).  Cards are beautiful.  Compact box.  Not too girlly (sp?), despite the theme.  I suggest it whole-heartedly.

Update (Feb.'09): Knocked down from 7 to 6.5.  Three years later and we never play it.  But that's b/c we've found better things.  It was a cool game though and I'd still suggest it.

Another Faidutti game in a small box with character abilities as a central theme.  That is not bad thing, but it makes the game very similar to his other games.

The queen is commissioning a necklace and you are competing with your fellow players to earn that right. Each turn players get an opportunity yo purchase cards from the tableau. The cards represent gems and characters that will grant you an ability. Each card that is not purchased decreases in value; if the card decreases to zero it is the discarded.

Three times players will go to market with the gems they have purchased. The value of the gems will be determined by their popularity and rarity. ¬†Each player secretly decides how many gems of each type they will take to market. ¬†The player with the most gems of a type earns the points for that gem type; this means players must pay attention to what gems have been purchased and guess who will likely go to market with what, and since the market is not compulsory it can be a gamble.

Draws on a lot of Euro mechanics. Reminds me of Ra, Hoity Toity, Modern Art, Nefertiti etc at different junctures of the game, and this isn't always good, since the game doesn't seem to have its own identity. Talking about identity, this game can't decide if it's a board game or a card game. Card images are nice, but a scoring track (if it's a card game) or pound notes (if it's a board game) would have been great. Think this is a solid 7 if the components were thought out better.

My favorite thing in this game is the declining value of cards.  Is a card important enough to you to pay a lot for it?  If it important enough to an opponent to keep it out of their hand?  Are a lot of cheap cards better than one expensive card?  Then you have to decide what gems to offer for sale.  I love decisions.  Another game my wife told me I needed to get :)  (7)
-----------------------------------------------
I have started playing a variant with my daughters (age 4 and 6) where all of the special cards are taken out, leaving only the jewels and the merchant cards.  We start with no cards in hand and currently offer all of our gems during each scoring interval.  That may change in the near future.  The girls absolutely love it.

A set collection game with alot of chaos and card effects thrown in.

Players try to collect gems that will hopefully score them big time during the 3 scoring rounds. Each turn, they get 10 gold to buy gems/characters revealed. Items that are not bought drop in price.

Interesting scoring twist where a rarer gem in addition to the favourite gem scores points too!

Ultimately, it feels like any strategy is thrown to the wind and players react instead to what's thrown at them.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nicely designed game where you collect gems, make us of special cards to mess with other players and others to increase the value of your collection.  There are 3 sale/scoring rounds where the one who plays the most of each of the gem types scores the points for that gem (runners-up score nothing), based on their fashion and rarity and the bonus cards (ring and banker).  This is a fun and thoughtful game with enough going on to be interesting but enough unknowns to keep everyone on their toes.  The randomness inherent in the game makes it sometimes a bit frustrating and the theme sometimes puts people off, but despite these, I still feel like I'd like to play this more than I actually have.  But not too much though...

RATING: 3
I was prepared to love this game: the lavish art, the jewelry, the interesting theme of working as Jewelers for the French Court! Looking at the character cards, I became very interested in playing. The production is really beautiful in every respect, something I've come to expect from Days of Wonder. It began well enough, trying to collect gemstones and using the occasional influence card to tweak things. On any given turn, a player has 10 ducats with which to buy cards (cards represent gems, characters with special powers, etc.). Anything a player does not/can not purchase is devalued for the next player and available for purchase, along with some new cards to replace the missing ones. This mechanic introduces a lot of fun and tension into the purchasing phase of the game, and I really liked it. Three times in the game, a Merchant card appears and there is a big jewelry sale. Here's where the ickyness comes in, and all the accumulated tension and fun from the purchasing phases is squandered. First off, the instructions for scoring are not written very clearly. It took a bit of work to puzzle out how the rarity tokens work, and how the actual scoring works. I'm still not sure I did it correctly. The scoring and the character cards (to a lesser degree) make the game rather chaotic and tad too fiddly for its own good. What do I mean? Well, by "chaotic" I mean that your strategy doesn't count for that much in this game. You can work towards a goal with respect to scoring (winning), but it becomes almost a complete crap-shoot given how scoring works. There is almost no way to predict what opponents will do, and it becomes, not a game of using psychology to outguess, but rather an exercise in random decision making. Some chaos is good. But here, it's enough (for me anyway) to feel that playing the game is pointless. Queen's Necklace also feels more complex than it should be. The work to reward ratio is off. As I indicate, my comments are based upon a single play, but I doubt I will play this again. It just isn't much fun for me.

Update: After a second play, I've raised my estimation of this game a little. If you pay close attention in a card-counting kind of way, then the game does involve relevant tactical decision-making. But serious card-counting is out of place in this "airy" game which seems to have been designed and explained (in the rules) for little girls. In any case, jumping up and down and screaming "I've got the Queen's Necklace!" provides entertainment for all present.

Better than I expected.  Plays very quick with a lot of chaos though.

Card game with pretty components (especially the price rings on the cards).  Cards are purchased, and cards that have been available for a long time have slowly decreasing costs.  Nice wronkage factor with the King card and changing values of the Favorite card remind me of Modern Art.  

UPDATE: Have played a couple of more times, and I really like this one.  Moving up to an 8.

Another good three-player game.  And since our usual third player is a 7.5 year old, this is one of the most challenging games we can play as a family.  It's also very fun (which seems to be a hallmark of Faidutti's games)!

The bluffing/second-guessing aspects are great (and thematically they play more like speculation than like betrayal which may be a consideration for some family gamers) and we all appreciate the "it ain't over til it's over" quality of the game.

If the title doesn't ring a bell, don't let it mislead you into thinking this is a game for little girls (the name comes from a book by Alexander Dumas, author of The Three Musketeers).

Your goal in this game is to buy and sell gems in the most profitable manner. There are several types of gems, and their relative market value fluctuates, both as a result of supply and demand, and manipulation by the players.

Other types of cards hint at the world of intrigue in Dumas' world, and provide you with alternate methods of advancing your interests. So, primarily a market speculation game, with a dash of intrigue. Luck plays a part, and the ability to predict your opponents' actions can pay big dividends.

All in all, a solid game in a small box that plays quickly and is family friendly.

[DoW 2003 edition] {Novel, France; set collection, drafting, blind-bidding; optimal 3p} A nice family card game. The rules are simple but it takes time to learn the power and value of each function card. QN is very good for 3p and I sometimes play it with 2 players. I don't like 4p game: there are more down time and more luck dependent (because it is likely that a player can only buy good cards that are just opened at his turn).

QN has great cards and tiles. The art work is very pretty. It makes QN look very attractive.

One needs to strive for a balance between collecting gems and function cards. Collecting only gem cards will make a player vulnerable to attacks. Collecting too many function cards will hinder one's power in making jewels. If one plans to collect gem cards, he needs to protect himself from Forgers and Thieves by purchasing 2-3 musketeers and to get the Queen's Necklace. 

I think the Queen's necklace card is a little bit overpowered in 2p game: in most of my games, the one with Queen's necklace will win. Players have to cooperate to thwart the Queen's necklace - that means it's hopeless in 2p game.

The new characters in Faidutti's web page are quite interesting. They provide fresh ways of playing. Players should try it.

Decent game of trying to collect sets and play them to score the best value. Only the player playing the highest set gets to score that gem type, but the more gems are played, the lower the total value, leading to a balancing act which does seem fairly random since it is dependent on hidden actions of other players.

Upgraded with: Pile of  little "gem" markers to use for scoring.

This is a fun little card game that mixes set collection with some blind-bidding based on memory.  It moves quick and is easy to explain.  There's a lot of room for subtle tactics here which gives the game some depth.  I love the way of tracking the cards to lower their values.  It works really well.

Collect cards and then blind bid with them for points. The twist being that the more cards you play, the higher your chances of winning that set, but the lower the value.

It felt super light and without any really interesting choices (beyond the blind bids, but there were really only 3 decisions since the last bid is basically just 'throw down all your cards'. 

Not one I'd really care to play again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
You collecting gems and can sell them 3 time in the game. But only the players who bids the most of a kind will sell them. You don`t know how the other players bid (blind biding) and you don`t want to bid all, because the less gems of a kind, that higher the price.

Many special cards cause the game more interesting, like the king - nobody sell this kind of gem, or the thief - steal one card.

Every round you have 10 money. Every card who wasn`t bought is cheaper (somebody is out of a game). You can buy one card or more cards. But sometimes you want one card.

You must decide you want more gems or more special cards and when use the special cards and when sell the gems.

Although I understand why the auctions in Queen's Necklace should be engaging, in practice they just don't interest me very much.  Player interaction is almost limited to just the three auctions in the giant deck, so this is a pretty solitary experience.  As far as bling goes, the pricing rings are fiddly and the necklace is hard to put on.  I guess I don't wear jewelry very well.

Very nice game.  Fans of the game question the low ranking.  I too think it is ranked pretty low, but on the other hand it seems to be ranked fairly high when you consider that it is a card game with a theme that would throw a lot of people.

Personally I love an original theme and the gameplay is very tight. 

I also don't understand people who find moving the rings to be too fiddly.  I even think it is kind of fun.

Update:  Rating went down from 8 to 7.5. I have played this a lot and just prefer other games now, but everything I wrote above still holds and I think this is a very good 
game.

An interesting mix of mechanics make this an enjoyable card-based game.  Being dealt four cards at the start keeps you from having perfect information and allows for surprises in even the first sale.  Your choices of how many gems to sell and when to use your king, ring, banker and the Queen's Necklace bring an element of chicken to the table.  The mix of character cards adds some variety as well.  The artwork is great and the components are top-notch.  My only complaint is that you aren't given tokens or money to keep track of the score.  For some reason, we usually use the chips from Modern Art.

Purchased at PrezCon 05 Auction.  I had heard several people claim that this was one of Faidutti's (and Cathala's) best games.  I heard it enough times to make getting it for $10 a steal.  Well, I just played my first game (2 players) and I'm almost sorry I paid so little.  The game was very interesting, and the end was a nail biter.  The way the cards devaluate is a very interesting mechanism, and keeps you constantly thinking about what you need and what your opponent needs.  Since most cards are purchased face up, you can see what people get.  In fact, it is unusually important in this game to keep track of what each player has and therefor what they can do.   I'm concerned that it overly favors a card counter.  Thank goodness for the confessor.

While I have cooled on Citadels and come to sort of abhor the muddledness 
of Dragonstones, I am still into this Faidutti collaboration. In the same vein as Citadels and Dragonstones but, it is not just retread. Something about the jewel valuation really appeals to me. I can see how this could be a washout for some. Still I think it is a good mix of strategy and luck. That said I just can't see how this would be the least bit compelling with only two players. The Days of Wonder components and visuals are appealing.

Fairly standard set collection game, with cards that provide special powers spicing things up. I liked the interesting decreasing cost system of the cards, as each turn that a card goes unpurchased it becomes cheaper. So if you wait, you might be able to buy multiple cards next turn. Or, purchase that one great card you really need right now, as it may not be there next turn. Special powers allow you to steal cards, look at a players hand, adjust the relative values of the four gems you're collecting, etc, pretty common for a Faidutti design.

Three times in the game there's a blind bidding phase, where you simultaneously bid for all four gem types. Special event cards can again be played in this phase, to do things like cancel the bidding in a gem you're poor in, double your return in a gem you win, etc.

Why I didn't get this sooner is beyond me (like way back when Wizards stores were liquidating it).  Anyway, this is one of the better Faidutti games where card abilities will change the makeup of the game.  The chaos isn't too bad in this one and there's room for a calculated strategy (I just haven't figured out a good one yet).  Still, a solid game plus I like most Faidutti games.

Very enjoyable game. Players go into a &#039;drafting&#039; process whereby you have 10 points to spend on cards. If you do not draft them, the cards value decreases until they get dropped off so it may allow another player to draft mulitple cards each turn. 
There are variety of cards to draft to keep things interesting. 3 rounds of scoring, which are randomised to increase tension. Leader usually gets bashed if they are leading on the 3rd round via robbing him, making him discard etc to keep things close. 
Nice components too! Best with 3 as there is more control. much more luck with 4

Based on three playings.  The game's not nearly as chaotic as you think.  Sure, there's special characters, etc. that others can play on you, and you can never be sure how a sale can be in your favor or turn against you, but that's the beauty of the game.  When I get beat, I know it's because a) someone outplayed me, and/or b) I made one or more mistakes along the way.  I like this one (at least right now) considerably more than Citadels.

The turn to turn structure I really like. I'm less thrilled about the blind bidding between rounds. The problem is there aren't enough blind bids to balance out throughout the game (only three). It robs the tactics during the actual gameplay of its meaning and importance. It's like taking the time to set up Risk and then only rolling the dice 3 times each to see who wins.

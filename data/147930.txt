RATING: 9
Fantastic two-player game with a deduction element. I like the piece removal, making this similar to Chess, and the deduction element about the Rebel's secret assassins. This sounds and looks like a miniature war game, but it plays elegantly like an abstract. Can't get enough of it so far.

RATING: 7
This new Essen release from a Polish designer is a brilliant theme (would-be assassins hiding amongst citizens waiting to attack the king). I love deduction games like Mr Jack, so this looked right up my street. It's brand new (Nov 2013) so there's a bit of cult-of-the-new here! But the game holds up. It's VERY simple in its ruleset, and part of me wants more meat to the game, but the short duration is full of tense moments, and it makes for a good portable 2 player experience.

Traded away for Domaine. I fear I may later regret this trade, because I liked King and Assassins a lot. I just can't see me ever picking it over Mr Jack.

Super fun 2 player greatness! This is like a thematic chess game. One player has to get their king across the board to the castle using his knights as protectors (and sacrificial blockers!) while the other player is the citizens, 3 of whom are assassins. They are trying to get close enough to the king to wound him and then kill him. This is just flat out fun. The cards tell you how many action points each group has each turn and whether or not the knights can arrest a citizen. Knights can also push citizens out of the way to open up space for the king. Flo and I played twice, back to back, switching sides. First game, I was able to assassinate the king when he was 1 step away from the castle gate when my last assassin jumped down from the roof, killing a guard in his way to the king. 2nd game, I got to the last card for the king needing a 2 movement to get to the castle (the king player also loses if they are not in the castle by the time the card deck runs out). The last card was a 2 movement. I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves 2 player games or abstracts.

I like this game; a kind of card controlled checkers game card with a bluff element.Its is very light and seems to be begging for an expansion or two to introduce character abilities, different objectives. However, this is unlikley since the base game was probably too light to get enough buzz going. All components look great.

One of the games, where one asks; "Why has this not been done long ago?"
So simple - and so rich in story! 
The king needs to get back to his castle ... and among the mob on the streets, there are three hidden assasins. The guards cannot arrest everyone ... just step for step they try to bring the king closer to safty. 
Short - intense - simple, streamlined gameplay - and very good storytelling: This makes a genius game in my book!

Décu de ne pouvoir pas jouer au dernier assassin's creed parce que vous n'avez pas de console dernière génération ? Rattrapez vous avec King & Assassins. C'est un jeu asymétrique à deux. L'un fait le roi adoré qui veut rentrer au château, sous les cris de son bon peuple (qui lui jette des cailloux et se masse devant ses chevaliers en criant "Le roi à la potence, on veut du pain") . L'autre cache ses 3 assassins dans cette même foule...se rapproche ... un peu ... encore un peu ... la lame coulissante dans la manche droite... et ... non, le roi a placé ses chevaliers pour franchir la foule ...il faudra attendre le prochain tour que le roi se rapproche. Dans ce jeu, c'est bien de faire au moins 2 parties et d'échanger les rôles. Il y a une forte tension dans la partie. Un bon jeu à deux.

Bardzo przyjemna asymetryczna gra dla 2 osób. Osobiście kojarzy mi się z serią Assassin's Creed i nawet trochę z Wiedźminem, więc są to pozytywne skojarzenia. Trzeba próbować przewidywać, co zrobi przeciwnik, można podpuszczać przeciwnika, skoro prawie do końca nie ujawnia się tożsamości asasynów. Ma syndrom rozegrania jeszcze jednej partii po przeciwnej stronie barykady. Prosta do wytłumaczenia, ładnie wykonana.

Game inspired by Assassins Creed series, that's for sure. Gameplay is fast, which is good, there's some level of bluffing, but if I'd like to play a good game with assassin, I'd just turn on my console and launch AC.

I really like the idea of the game, but in practice it feels a little bit clunky. Having to hide or disguise your intentions is hard to do in a 2-player move-your-guys-on-the-board game, so I probably need to play more to see how it works out. But my initial impression was very mixed.

Bought it at Essen 2013. It has beautiful artwork with respect to the cards and the set-up displays. Only the board looks a bit boring to me. After playing it twice I have the impression that it is a fast tactical asymmetrical two-player game, which is played within 15 to 20 minutes. There are only a few rules which are explained within less than 5 minutes. The game comes with a handout for each player, which clearly summorizes these rules.

Another Essen release, a distant relative of Stratego, this is a two-player game in which one player steers a king and his guards from one side of the chequered board to his castle on the other side through a crowd, while the other player controls the members of the crowd. Before the game he secretly selects three people in that crowd to be the assassins. Each turn a card is drawn showing how many moves each player can make. Besides just moving both the guards and the people in the crowd can climb up and jump off roofs which is cool. The guards are in some turns allowed to arrest a person (remove him from the game). The assassins can suddenly reveal themselves and attack. If they manage to kill the king before he reaches his castle, he wins. Beautifully thematic and original game that works well, I'm just not sure how much replay value it has. Also the fact that the cards determine when a guard can arrest someone breaks the theme somewhat and the luck of the cards can really disadvantage one side or the other this way. Arresting someone should just be an expensive action to take.

Easily one of the hidden highlights of BGG.Con 2013.  There was some hype on this game coming out of Essen and the research I did on it made it look like a game I'd enjoy.  Then we get to BGG.Con and there's nothing on this game.  No one is selling it and no one is even talking about it.

Luckily someone at BGG had the wherewithall to grab two copies for the Library and we grabbed this thing about 4-5 times throughout the week.

The game is an assymetrical two player game.  One player plays an evil king and his guards who are trying to make it across the city without being killed by 3 hired assassins.  The other player plays the 3 secret assassins and the citizens.  Each turn the king and his men have a limited amount of moves they can do.  You can't hold back the king too much because when the deck runs out, the king loses, so you gotta get his butt moving.  The assassins position the citizens in a way trying to force the king and his minions into a trap.  As an assassin you have to wound the king twice to win.

The game is simple to learn but insanely fun to play.  Get a copy if you can.  I had to buy one from England.  Money well spent!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
King and Assassins is an excellent asymmetrical two player game.  In it players either take on the role of the King and his knights/bodyguards, or the crowd of villagers and the assassins hidden amongst them.  The King player wins if he can arrest, or kill off all the assassins, or get his King across the village square and into the castle before the deck of cards runs out.  The assassin player wins if he can kill the king, or prevent the king from getting to the castle before the deck runs out.

Whether playing the King, or the Assassins the tension is palpable.  Either way you're worried that there won't be enough time to carry out your objective.  The assassin player will try to bluff his opponent, leading protective guards away from the King.  The King player will try to form a human shield of guards that will inevitably weaken due to the assassins killing some of them off.

If you like hidden roles, strategy, bluffing, and a lot of cat-and-mouse action you definitely should play King and Assassins.  By the way, don't believe the hype that the Assassins have a huge advantage over the King.  Anything can happen in this game.

--- Preliminary thoughts ---
Bluffing asymmetrical game, not really strategical.

The idea is original and for sure it will make for several nice games. But once the novelty fades out as you try to edvelop several strategical ideas, I think nothing interesting will remain there to motivate me to play it again.

A fast-paced, easy-to-learn, 2-player game of cat-and-mouse!

A real highlight is that the simple mechanics allow players to focus more on tactics and trickery than looking up rules every minute.

A notable downside is the limited number of maps (only two) that aren't particularly well-balanced.

RATING: 7
Mmmm, asymmetry in a 2 player is always a good thing and fun to explore. I've only played the once so I have no idea as to balance (and no idea how much playtesting has been undertaken to ensure it), but it doesn't matter, it was enjoyable to explore. Flip a card which says how many actions points each has and whether the king's nights are allowed to capture this turn. Then the king and his knights attempt move across the board to one of the escape spots. The care need to be taken here is that there's no easy way for one of the opposing twelve peasants, any 3 of which might be a secret assassin (determined pre-game) to easily get to the king, which generally means moving in a mini-phalanx, pushing the citizens around to make space. The assassins on their turn will gradually reveal one by one as the turns go by at opportune times, knocking off 1 or 2 guards to reduce the amount of protection offered the king. The king's team is on a timer (set number of rounds) so he can't afford to move everyone all the time. With no idea who the assassins are, there's a bunch of tension on what to move whilst keeping protection for the king. For the assassin, it's about setting up multiple potential threats (which will mostly be bluffs), which need to be protected against by the king. You really can't afford to lose one of your 3 assassins to a random capture without him having done some damage, so there's some real tension when you put him within likely capture range as to whether he'll be the one captured this turn. And that could be the game, so there's some luck involved. The rules are simple to learn, the player aids word, the cardboard pieces and art are nice enough. It can be played with quick turns for fun, or at a slower pace for a thinking man's game, and both timeframes would feel right. I enjoyed it. It says to choose your 3 assassins after the peasants have been setup, but I reckon it's more interesting to randomly pick three and see if you can do the job from there!

Picked up this game in a PIFF and it had been on my wishlist for a long while. I must have read about it before and it is kind of hard to come by. It is a very abstract game where you are trying to get the king home, or alternatively trying to assassinate the king depending on your role of the game. It is a 2p only and actually pretty interesting. The assassin has some good moves and can be tricky. Ron was less impressed than I was, but I do look forward to some more plays. I think it will get better with more plays.

A light little filler about manouevering and outguessing your oponent. Provides a great blend of thinking, bluff, theme ans simple rules without going close to the 'thinky game' territory while still being far from a random autopilot.

My only concern is replayability - it feels that with time most strategies will be explored and all plays will feel very like each other. It doesn't seem like there is more than one strategy to take and minor differences in board situation, without enough depth which stick people to abstracts.

If you're however always on the lookout for quick fillers to play with your lover when you both have neither strenght nor time for something more serious (even like the little Agricola) and not a title for ages to come, it is certainly worth recommending.

Asymmetrical abstract game with hidden information in the vein of [thing=1917]Stratego[/thing] or [thing=2290]Ghosts![/thing], in which one player hides three assassins among the citizens of the village, and the other player tries to move the king through without getting stabbed in the back.

It's well-made and seems even properly tested, though the base idea is not very new. A variable game-board would be nice; I kind of can see this one to be played with downloadable print-it-yourself maps.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An interesting game that plays rather quickly and manages to create tension. 

There are some limitations, though. The movements of the king are limited to 1 or 2 per round, which sometimes feels like a crawl. Also, he has to basically get to the gate in the shortest path possible, having only about 5 more moves total in the cards than the minimum needed. This somehow limits the options that you have as the king.

Also, the mechanics are very simple, which means that you will feel that there is not much more than bluff and blind guess to win or lose the game. It's fine, I guess, since the game is more of a light filler with some tactics (mostly bluff related) than anything else.

I wish, though, that arrests were not tied to the action cards. I feel it would have been better if you had a pool of arrests from the start, or if the cards simply added tokens to that pool. As it is, the King basically has to arrest someone whenever the icon appears, whether or not he wanted to, and it feels more random that premeditated. 

Still, I am glad to have this game in my collection. It might just not get as often to the table as wished.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Simple bluffing/deduction game where one player controls a king and his knights -- who must walk through the town square to reach the castle -- and the other controls the townsfolk, three of whom are secretly chosen as disguised assassins. Their win condition is regicide. A card turned up each turn shows how much each side can move and whether or not the guards are allowed to make an arrest.

It's a fantastic concept, but in practice I am left with some lingering feelings of dissatisfaction. The king has very little leeway to delay (he loses if the deck runs out), so it is necessary to push forward to the castle even if it seems strategically inadvisable. Compounding this is the inability to arrest at will -- if the arrest icon doesn't turn up, it may be necessary to leave a suspicious peasant in a position to easily kill a guard, step forward and stab the king. (Almost as annoying for the assassin player is when, in order to not waste an arrest opportunity, the guards seize a random peasant who just happens to be an assassin.)

To be fair, this is a problem with many deduction games (e.g. Mr Jack often comes down to a wild guess at an arrest for a 50% chance of victory), but here I found the lack of control unusually frustrating. 

There is a lot I love about this game but I don't think it's [i]quite[/i] there. Fun to play occasionally but not the hoped-for classic.

The game uses cards that assign AP to each player who uses them to move the characters on the board with the king (and guards) trying to reach the other side and the 3 assassins (and villagers) trying to delay them and kill the king. The game goes along at a terrific pace but it seemed that it came down to luck of the arrest rather than any insight or logic. Perhaps more plays will show greater depth.

A clever little game of moving the king through a crowd where there are three hidden assassins. It appears to be pretty difficult for the assassins to win, especially with the number of arrest cards in play, but this is a clever slim design.

At least after the first few games, it feels awesome. Don't know whether it is going to keep being fun after more games as the replayability doesn't seem too great.

This is a two player game, one is the king and his guards and one is the people of the town. The folks player chooses three people as assassins who can kill the king. The king can arrest them with his guards but he does not know which of them.
The king tries to reach his castle whereas the folks try to hinder and kill him.
Each player has their movement points which are drawn every round (card).
So it's a social deduction game (at least for one player) and you have to manage your action points wisely to get the most out of it.
This rating is based on one play. It was very cool to play this. You never know what your opponent is planning. I was the king and I had a lot of thoughts going through my mind in order to try to deduce the (possible) assassins.
I like how you can slowly exclude some of the possible candidates which could murder you. Overall it was a very thrilling experience. Certainly one of the better two player games I played so far.

Nice little asymetrical two-player game. Easy to explain and fairly quick to play, yet most rounds are close and tense.

Very good 2p game. Feels like a bluffing, thematic chess game.

Very fast and easy gameplay. The game is well balanced, and can be lost on one judgement error, if the other player is in position to exploit it.

Asymmetrical game where one player is moving king through the board, while opponent is trying to assassinate the king. I'm unsure about the balance, playing as assassin looks easier.

Excellent card driven movement system.  Excellent components with thick counters for the stand-up figures.

RATING: N/A
Two player tactical grid movement where the king is escorted by his guards that shove through the citizens to get the king safely into the castle without being assassinated. Fun, light deduction. Fun chase moments, guards dropping like flies, as the lethal and stealthy assassin slips through the crowd. Refreshingly different from the last 100 games I've played. Reminds of Stratego even though I don't think of them as similar.

it looks like a nice themed game but it isn't. plays like a light chess game -  very abstract! Just nothing for me

RATING: N/A
Seemingly simple set of rules but with a lot of decisions. Seems to me to be harder for the King to win, but others have won with him. Every move has to be thought out - it's not chess-level by any means, but as heavily-themed abstracts go, this is a good puzzle.

And I like standees.

An interesting asymmetrical two-player game. Easy rules to learn, lots of bluffing, hard to master with great variety and re-playability. Very good quality and art design of the components, markers, cards, hard game-board.

Interesting asymmetrical two player game. As the king you never know what lurks around any corner. Better you enchain them ALL! :)

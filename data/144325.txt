Just another copy of Munchkin. I thought it was worth owning one.  The game is very much decided by who has the best cards.

RATING: N/A
The Mrs. picked this up mainly because it was a Target exclusive. Haven't played it yet but it should mix well with everything that Munchkin 1 does, making it a nice alternative when those original cards get boring. I hope.

A newer version of Munchkin that focuses on myths and legends rather the 'purely' fictional fantasy. If you are a fan of historical mythology you might enjoy this version of the game more.

You can always mix and match sets too (I would likely mix Conan in with these sets).

It's a fun and imaginative game. Other variants are better designed. We often end up playing my friend's Axe Cop variant

Can replace base Munchkin due to similar card types (Wizard, Thief, Halfling, etc) but is mythology themed (also includes urban myths and movie references). Very fun and a good high visibility intro to Munchkin (only sold at Target)

Un juego que todo el mundo dice que termina quemándose. Yo aún estoy en la fase de querer jugarlo y putear a todo el mundo. Obviamente no sería nunca mi primera opción pero para grupos a los que meterles un eurogame sería duro es una opción que no suele defraudar aunque teniendo claro que no es un juego para todo el mundo. Lo peor que le veo es que mucho azar (ir después del que tiene la posibilidad de ganar te da muchos puntos para la victoria) pero tengo claro que ese no es el objetivo del juego, sino apuñalar a tus "amigos".

Like... it's just Munchkin. Really not much of a difference. If you're itching for another Munchkin set, get literally any other one, because those will have different races and classes. (My score for every Munchkin game and expansion is a 3, but I don't want to clutter up my stats.)

Miti e Leggende riversati nel mondo di Munchkin... o viceversa? Boh, comunque un gran set (168 carte) ricco di citazioni e divertimento. Può essere giocato da solo oppure essere mischiato al Fantasy (riporta lo stesso dorso). È di fatto una nuova versione introduttiva in tema di miti e leggende!

The better of the two Munchkin's I own, imo. I prefer the mythical setting over the regular vanilla setting. It's the Deluxe version that came with the second expansion so there's a lot more replay value in the box from the get go.. still, it's Munchkin.

Get him to the Greek!  All the fun of a Mythical Hero RPG without the role-playing.  Of course, role-playing is the primary point of RPGs.  On the other hand, I do think this game is a fun diversion to quickly kill monsters, gather loot, and build a character, all with fun pokes at RPG and Mythical Hero culture.

My favorite version of Munchkin.  Keeps to the original premise without extra complications to the rules found in other versions.  Plus the cards are more fun and beefy.  Not as crude as some cards from regular Munchkin.  I can play it with my church youth group.

For almost two months, my wife and I played this every night after we got home from work. We got a lot of play out of this. It retains its replayability when playing with new people. After playing with my wife so much, we can predict each other too well. This would be a good gateway game for nerds that are interested in learning about the hobby. I want to get some expansions to keep it interesting, but I think the expansions are overpriced. I am surprised to see this game's rating be so low.

This is a very silly "take that!" kind of card game. Very little skill involved and a lot of luck but can be quite enjoyable with the right group. A problem with this game is that the game can drag on and on because of unlucky card draws and people just being downright mean. Usually all players gang up on the player who is winning and makes there life miserable! Also, I am a big rule-follower and the rulebook states that if there is a rule discrepancy to hash it out amongst the players...my worst fear! A little too silly for me most of the time.

Munchkin is a fun game with amusing cards and effects but involves very little strategy. The game becomes slowly trawling to higher levels with everyone reluctant to play cards before someone is about to win, at which point every card in the game is played to stop them. Then the next person in a position to increase their level usually wins. Massive kingmaker problems.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Seems like the "you have to kill a monster to reach level 10" rule is responsible for most of the game's problems. There's little point in using one-shot combat strength mods before the ending as it is, so there are few strategic/economic choices for most of the game, and then there's the awful bash-the-leader endgame.

If you were allowed to buy level 10, everyone would have to use their tricks earlier, making valuations of encounter difficulty, rewards, the particular opponent's closeness to 10, etc. The decks might have to be rebalanced a little, but the game would strongly benefit from it.

The first modern board game I played. Immediately was hooked and had a lot of fun. Went home and ordered it. Unfortunately it does get stale quick though, largely because it takes way too long to play for such a simple/luck-based game (up to 2 hours or so).
Can definitely be fun if everyone is in the right mood for a light goofy game, and if you find a way to limit the game time by setting a timer or starting on level 3 instead of level 0. 
I'm sure there are a lot of better games out there, but good for some laughs for the first few plays (or to bring out every once in a while). The excessive use of text also drags the game down for new players. Being a little OCD about rules was a challenge for me with this game as arguing over the loose rules is part of the game! Nevertheless, still one you can have fun with.

We found this pretty cheap, and I don't regret the purchase, but it isn't one of our go-to games. It is silly enough and simple enough, but other games take about the same amount of time and offer way more enjoyment. Ultimately, after every game we just look at each other and shrug as if to say "is that it?" We haven't built anything, collected anything, and the victory seems more or less based on luck.

This is a fun game where it is encouraged to stab your friend in the back. The artwork and theme is playful and ridiculous which adds to it. It gets a bad rap for being a bit too luck of the draw, but that's mainly from those who think that they are above this type of game and too smart for it. It can be pretty fun especially if you play with others who are just as willing to stab you in the back.

Munchkin Legends made me upset. Legends is a thinly layered retheaming of the first set. Adding nothing new like the other stand alone Munchkin game, Munchkin Legends is a pass in a big way.

This is basically the same as normal munchkin and it didn't even add new races like centaurs or naga or something mythological like I was expecting. So it hasn't received many plays and to be honest I regret buying it

My 2nd favorite theme after Munchkin Apocalypse. I like all the ancient mythology more than the classic fantasy flavor. If anyone is looking to play Munchkin for the first time, this would be a better option than the original game.

RATING: 6
I have to admit I was a little disappointed to find that this uses the standard fantasy races - Dwarves, Elves and Halflings (HALFLINGS!? REALLY!?). I wish there'd been more myth-based races (Fauns? Centaurs?) Or they could have done something like they did for Conan and instead of races have  Greeks, Romans, Egyptians, Vikings, etc... Otherwise this is a pretty decent addition to the Munchkin series.

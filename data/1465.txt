For years this was about the ONLY game I would play. Before that, I had resisted playing it for years because it looked like a fantasy game to me. I have since found the path of gaming enlightenment and advanced to more complex games, but I still enjoy this one.

RATING: 6
Quite possibly my favorite game of trump; I have played it so much I've worn out 2 decks since I first played in the mid '90s (if that's not a rousing endorsement, I don't know what is). It's a game where I want to sit down and play 3 or 4 games in a row and then set it down for a season. There is some strategy and evolving metagame involved; when to play Wizards/Jesters, how aggressive your group is (and how much you want to be) in both play and bidding. In particular, this is why I'm not fond of the blind bid or simultaneous bid variant; that circular bid provides information in terms of the evolving game style. Very playable at the extremities of 3 and 6, I think it works best in the middle though. Very recommended, and easy to teach if you're interested in trick taking games.

One must absolutely play with the "clickers," and we prefer to play "double-blind." That is, bids are made secretly and only revealed after the completion of play. Very fun!

A good time on trick-taking games in that you bid on tricks won. Towards the end game it gets a bit gamey though since you can guarentee scoring if you're in the lead.

I don't believe this predated the playing card game, Oh Hell, but it does add a nice twist to it.  The 4 wizard and 4 fool cards are enough to change the dynamics and complicate the trick-taking.  A worthy improvement on a classic game.  Oh, and go for the German deck if you can--the artwork is fantastic.

A trick-taking game with a couple of unique features.
Played this once and a terrific time was had by all.

Predicting the number of tricks you'll take and being rewarded/punished according to whether you succeed makes for difficult decision making, especially since all of your plans can go up in smoke when someone plays the Wizard and wins what you thought was a sure thing.

Habe lange kein Stich-Kartenspiel mehr gespielt.
Daher brauchte es etwas Auffrischung und ein paar nette Erklärungen meiner Mitspieler. Die kannten das Spielprinzip aus ihrer Jugend als 'Stiche Vorhersagen' mit einem Rommespielblatt. Dafür ging es gar nicht mal so schlecht mit meiner ersten Partie Wizard bei der richtigen Vorhersage der Stiche. Aber ab 12 Karten auf der Hand wurde aus der Vorhersage dann doch mehr eine Wettervorhersage als eine gut begründete Prognose :-)
Wie man mit 3 Spielern und am Ende 20 Karten auf der Hand noch etwas sinnvolles vorhersagen soll bleibt mir wahrscheinlich immer ein Rätsel.
Das Spiel hat sicherlich seinen Reiz wenn es auch nicht mein Lieblingsspiel werden wird.

A trick taking game with a odd scoring mechanic, this game favors the aggressor.  Overall though, this is just another trick taking game.  Luck of the draw will win more - especially if good draws occur in the earliest rounds.  I much prefer games that add something unique to the card play and not make the attempt at uniqueness in scoring mechanics.

Fantastic trick-taking game that scales well from 3-6. I think it should only be played with the rule that the dealer, when bidding tricks, must not sum up to the total number of tricks available.

melb 12/09 from good games.

Art work is reminiscent of the Brothers Hildebrant. Colourful game.

RATING: 9
A well-deserved classic. The trick mechanics are fun in combination with the win prediction. Due to increasing hand size each round the game stays interesting until the end.

Also, the illustrations on the cards are incredibly cheesy and downright terrible. But it's part of the game's charm and I wouldn't want to miss them. Also, it has no effect on the gameplay.

60 card deck comprising a standard deck plus 4 Wizards (high) and 4 Jesters (low). In the first hand 1 card is dealt to each player, in the second 2, etc.  The object is for each player to bid the number of tricks they think they can take from each hand, then to take exactly that many. You get 20 points for correctly predicting how many tricks you will win plus 10 points for each trick won. You lose 10 points for each trick over or under the amount you  predicted. At least one player will fail on each hand, because the total number of tricks bid by the players may not equal the number of tricks available on that hand.  Excellent twist on Oh Hell.  My trick taking game of choice.

Original standard card deck worn out.  The Amigo picture version arrived as a replacement.  Makes a great game unplayable for many.  Seek out the standard version.

In the category traditional cardgames I record my plays for "slagen raden", a game I used to play oftenin my teenager years. Never knew that the game was commercialised as Wizard. Of course wizard can't be bad but I prefer the game as I used to play it with a traditional deck. The only difference is the use of Zauberer and Narren which are not used in the traditional game. The counting is slighty different but that's no problem. Because of the Z and N you have a little less controll.

Entertaining trick-taking game with a heap of strategy and skill required.  Runs into some problems encountered with most card games; a player can be all but eliminated halfway through the game and still be forced to finish the game.  Also, drags on too long with three players, and gets too random with 6; 4-5 is the optimal number.  Far better than most card games at eliminating the luck factor.  New players with no experience at trick-taking games can expect to be killed, however.

Pro's:

1) You can basically teach this to anyone that has ever played a card game.
2) I enjoy the predictive meta game of people having to announce how many tricks they can take.

Con's:

1) Considering you can pretty much play Wizard with a standard 52 card deck and also then play tonnes of other games with a 52 card deck, well why not just bring a standard 52 card deck. 
2) Cards are kind of flimsy.

Weren’t it for its light fantasy theme, Wizard could be mistaken for a traditional card game, given the way it plays and feels: to strengthen this feeling, its sixty-card deck is split into four suits with thirteen cards each and the addition of eight special cards (four wizards and as many madmen), as though the traditional joker had been split into two different faces.

As far as the game goes though, I deeply enjoy Wizard’s core mechanics, that is the bets about your success expectations for the round you are required to state after the cards have been dealt, since this forces you to play boldly and kind of drives the more aggressive or cautious way you choose to play: this makes Wizard a light and versatile game at the same time, allowing both a generous range of strategic options and a thoughtless, aggressive and daring playing.

Relatively standard trick-taking game.  Long if you play a full game (13 rounds, I think).

RATING: 7
A step up from knockout whist. You have to predict how many tricks you will take and you score accordingly. Best variant is the one where the sum of all players predictions cannot equal the number of cards in each players hand, so someone always has to lose.

Interesting dynamic that can be played with almost any age group equally well.  This is a game you can bring out with non-gamer parents or grandparents.  I would say it is not the best choice to have when you are in a group of actual gamers, there are better, more in depth games for those times.

rage deck or lectio set. from wild guess to precision skill, each round has distinct feel. too many rounds by default rule.

(2 plays) Mediocre trick taking game where you have to bid on the number of tricks you will take. The challenge comes with the turn-wise increasing number of cards on your hand, as your hand size increases from one card in turn one to 10 cards in the last turn.

RATING: 8.5
Trick-taking game with a random trump suit each hand and an increasing hand size (first 1 card, then 2, etc.). The twist is that instead of trying to win the most hands you bid on how many hands you think you will win and get points based off of that.

Wizard is a very fun twist on normal card games, thus very easy to teach to people who have only played normal card games.

I think it's best with 5 or 6 people. 4 is good. 3 is awkward.

Wizard is interesting trick taking game with easy rules and high fun factor. The game tends to take a lot more time that the box says but in a right crowd it's enjoyable.

The blue cards add some interesting twists to the Oh Hell gameplay.  At first I didn't like them because it seemed like they just added more randomness to the game, but after a while the ability to throw them off even when you have the suit led started to grow on me.  The scoring is less cutthroat than Oh Hell too.  Still, I don't see any reason to buy Wizard if you own a standard deck of cards: just play Oh Hell.

We used to play "Diminishing Bridge" with friends/family growing up. Very similar. I prefer the way we played with a standard deck (but that's probably just nastalgia). This is a great trick tacking game. Fun!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Basically a slightly tweaked version of the traditional card game, Oh Hell. Wizards are like an uber-trump and jesters are easy throw-offs. These two do introduce some minor randomness, but it didn't strike me as a huge improvement over the basic game. First, it's much better if the number of tricks bid cannot equal the number of tricks available. Tension is good! Also, here's an alternate scoring system I believe is an improvement over the usual scoring method, in that it that reduces the potency of simply bidding zero as often as possible: (1) Bidding and taking zero tricks is always worth exactly 5 points, no matter the hand size. (2) Bidding and failing to take any number of tricks subtracts ten times the difference between tricks bid and tricks taken. (3) Bidding and exactly taking any number of tricks greater than zero adds ten times the number of tricks plus the number of tricks squared!

RATING: 6
OK, but I can't see that the new cards add much to Oh Hell!  If you are not playing with 8  players, you might as well play Oh Hell!  The bid wheels in the deluxe version look cool, though -- I would like to give those a try

The best of the many Oh Hell knock-offs, IMHO.

Very fun game that feels a lot like Crazy Rook with a few minor variations.  It is defintiely less forgiving than Crazy Rook.  You either take your bid and get points or miss your bid and lose points.  The more you miss your bid the more points you lose, so there is no trying to take multiple tricks to make up the difference.  

Dad thoroughly enjoys this game, and wants to play it back to back.  Not too many games grip me enough to play it back to back.  (1/4/10)

Oh Hell! is a great game. Amazing how 8 extra cards can almost ruin it. Takes a game where any hand is playable/scorable, and turns it into one where you can't win if you don't draw the special cards. 

Update: played again recently and my opinion is unchanged. Decent hands without wizards can not be well bid. I got dealt a 13/12/3 of trump in the 3 deal. How can you make an intelligent bid on that? In regular Oh Hell that is a slam dunk 3, or 2 if you lead and are skittish. Here, you have absolutely no idea. In my game, I bid 2 (what else could I do?) - all 3 wizards were out and I took 0. This happens alot. Its only easy to bid bad hands and hands with wizards. It adds so much luck. 

Plus, the graphic design is awful. I was straining to tell yellow from white, Z (wizards) and N (jesters) look exactly the same in your hand and when played (this is really an abominable graphic design choice), and the dorky fantasy pictures basically mean it takes a game that non-gamers really like and turns it into one that I would never play with most people I know. The whole thing is still a pretty good game, but compeletly unnecessary when Oh Hell exists. The extra 8 cards you get are a shameless cash in.

A simple--for people who've played other trump games--and elegant card game that I found a lot more fun than I expected.  This one gets a lot of use as a 5- or 6-player game when the only other game options present only go up to 4 players.  Playing with the variant that each round must be under- or overbid ("screw the dealer") is a more fun (and exciting) way to spice up the game in a group of players who've played the game before.

RATING: 7.5
The rules seemed a bit unclear at first, and the entire game felt overly complex, but after giving it a fair try, it turned out to be surprisingly fun and easy after all!

The components of the game are hardly more than a bit of paper to keep track of the scoring, and a regular stock of cards, but the artwork of the cards is a very nice addition that gives some flavour to the game.

It may not be everyone's cup of tea and it may not make it to the die-hard gamers' tables very often, but it is definitely a nice game to keep you busy for a while. That said, this is THE game with the worst time-indication I have seen up to date: whereas the box says it plays in about 45 minutes, we spent over 2.5 hours on a three-player game with players who do not stall or pause for thought very much.

An inferior version of Oh Hell

May 2014 - It took me awhile, but I've come around to this game. I initially thought that it was too chaotic and players were subject to the whims of a good or bad hand.  When I hear this common complaint, I often say in that skilled players make better use of their cards and bids making the mediocre hand better.  Well, same here.  I'd still rather play Oh Hell as I like the scoring, but this really deserves a much higher ranking from me so it moves up from a 5 to an 8.

Thrift August 2007.  First play May 2008.

This is an excellent trick taking game.  Reminds me of Spades where you have to bid on the number of tricks you will take before you start playing.

The biggest difference in this game vs. other trick taking games is that the wizard and jester do not have to follow suit.  This adds a nice slice/dice element to the game.

Tried this one out on wife's family that plays a lot of sheep's head.  Everyone seemed to enjoy it.

RATING: 9
Components: Stunning cards by Franz Vohwinkel in the Amigo edition; so pretty they are distracting. The suit colors need to be more distinctive. The only way I can distinguish between the similar-looking Wizard (Z) and the Fool (N) is by calling the Fool a Nincompoop.

Experience: Agonizing decisions as the game shifts from a hand-assessment emphasis in the earlier rounds to tactical response in the later rounds. Unlike most trick-taking games where, after making a contract, each additional trick only counts for some additional points, in Wizard every last trick counts. Everything could be going great until the very last round, when I'm forced to win a hand because the player to my right led with a Fool. I love how the hands become increasingly unwieldy and difficult to predict, yes also increasingly more flexible to allow for reacting to over-/under-tricks.

Long our favorite card game and one that precise bidding and play of cards is tantamount. We play "screw the dealer" where the dealer can not make a bid that will make the total number of bids equal to the number of cards in your hand. This forced imbalance will always make someone not make their bid each round. Not a terrific game for 3, OK for 4, but we played with 5 and it shines then.

Improves with repeated play. The better you know the habits of your opponents, the more interesting each round becomes. 

Luck introduced by the distribution of Wizard and Jester cards is non-trivial, but doesn't make the game less enjoyable and can often be negated by good play.

Prefer playing with sequential bidding where the total number of bids cannot equal the number of cards in that hand. Early hands will leave the dealer with limited options, but that tends to even out over the course of the game (and point leaders become targets anyway).

I want to give this a 0. This is perhaps the worst game I've ever played in the history of I dunno, my life. First it's like you have to pay for this game that you could easily makeshift. It's one of those games that people made up then some company decided to make an official set and pretend like they were being original. Second of all, the game pretends like it has strategy when there really is like 0 strategy to it. I chose a random number half the time and did decently, which says something about this game. Third, this game eliminates you without actually eliminating you. When the point differentials are 300 to 40, you have no chance and may as well be eliminated, but then you're essentially forced to play so that the game doesn't get messed up. Finally, it's just not fun. It lasts for over an hour and you're just doing the same damn thing the entire time. Nothing changes. You just spend an hour plus just nonchalantly throwing cards into the center of a table. This game sucks.

Préparation
Le jeu est composé d'un bloc de score et de 60 cartes illustrée chacune par un joli dessin représentant un personnage :

    13 cartes numérotées de 1 à 13 et ce dans chacune des 4 couleurs
    4 cartes incolores Z (der Zauberer : le sorcier ) la carte la plus forte.
    4 cartes incolores N (der Narr : le fou) la carte la plus faible.

Le jeu se déroule en plusieurs manches. Le distributeur est tiré au sort. A la première manche il distribue 1 carte par joueur et il révèle l'atout, à la seconde manche le nouveau distributeur -le joueur à gauche du précédent distributeur- donnera 2 cartes par joueur, à la troisième manche 3 cartes, etc.

Le jeu se poursuit tant qu'il y des cartes, si bien qu'à 4 joueurs, les 60 cartes du paquet permettent de jouer sur 15 manches (15 cartes par joueur et pas d'atout pour la dernière manche !). Si la carte d'atout est une carte incolore N, où s'il ne reste plus de carte pour dévoiler l'atout, il n'y a pas d'atout. Si la carte d'atout est une carte incolore Z, le distributeur choisit la couleur d'atout sans avoir pris connaissance de son jeu.

Au début de chaque manche, les joueurs, en commençant par celui à gauche du distributeur, vont évaluer leur main et annoncer le nombre de plis qu'ils comptent faire pendant cette manche.

Si le dernier joueur à annoncer son contrat est le joueur en tête du score, il lui est interdit d'annoncer un nombre de plis qui ferait que la somme totale des plis annoncés par tous les joueurs soit égale au nombre de carte en main. Par exemple, si à la manche 8, A annonce 2 plis, B, 3 plis, C, 1 pli et que le dernier joueur D soit en tête, il ne peut annoncer 2 plis car 2+3+1+2=8.

Ces annonces sont notées sur la feuille de score. Commence alors la pose des cartes.


Il y a une règle principale qui régit la pose des cartes à Wizard : le premier joueur détermine la couleur demandée pour le pli, les autre joueurs doivent jouer cette couleur en priorité mais il est possible à tout moment de jouer une carte incolore (N ou Z), à une exception près : si la couleur demandée est celle de l'atout il est interdit de poser un Z. Le joueur qui sera dans l'impossibilité de faire autrement - au dernier pli par exemple - verra sa carte Z compter comme une carte N. Il n'est pas obligatoire de couper ou de surenchérir.

Quelques cas particuliers : si le premier joueur joue une carte Z, il est sûr de remporter le pli, les autres joueurs peuvent se défausser de n'importe qu'elle carte ; si le premier joueur joue un N, c'est le prochain joueur à poser une carte colorée qui déterminera l'atout ; si tous les joueurs jouent une carte N, c'est le premier à l'avoir jouée qui remporte le pli.

Le gagnant du pli est déterminé par :

    le 1er joueur à avoir poser un Z,
    s'il n'y a pas de Z, c'est le joueur à avoir posé l'atout le plus fort,
    sinon c'est le joueur qui à posé la carte la plus haute dans la couleur demandée.

A la fin de la manche, les plis de chacun sont comptabilisés de la manière suivante :

    le contrat est rempli : 20 pts + 10 par pli réalisé. Par exemple j'ai annoncé 0 pli et j'ai fais 0 plis je gagne 20pts, si j'avais annoncé et réalisé 3 plis le score serait de 20+ 3x10 = 50 pts.
    le contrat n'est pas rempli : le joueur prend un malus de -10 pts par pli qu'il n'a pas fait pour atteindre son contrat ou par pli qu'il a fait en trop. Par exemple j'ai annoncé 1 pli et j'en ai remporté 3, j'écope donc d'un malus de -20 pts.

A la fin de la partie, le joueur qui a le plus de points est déclaré vainqueur.

Mon opinion

Wizard est un jeu largement inspiré par le whist (l'ancêtre du bridge), sa simplicité le rend accessible aux personnes jouant occasionnellement et aux plus jeunes. Mais il ne faut pas s'y tromper, ce jeu comporte nombre de subtilités réjouissantes ; la phase d'enchère par exemple est toujours un moment de tension où chaque joueur est en proie à un dilemme cornélien.

Comme chacun se fixe ses propres objectifs en début de manche, le hasard de la donne s'en trouve réduit et il sera difficile de trouver un autre coupable que vous si vous avez perdu des points à cette manche !

Au fur et à mesure qu'une manche se déroule chaque joueur verra sa tension monter d'un cran, surtout si le nombre total de plis annoncés est différent du nombre de cartes distribuées à chacun car il y aura fatalement un ou plusieurs lésés.

C'est aussi un jeu où, quand le contrat est déjà rempli, il faut chercher à perdre les plis suivants, ce qui n'est pas facile et apporte une dimension inhabituelle et conviviale par rapport aux jeux classiques où il faut gagner à tout prix.

Comme chaque joueur reçoit une carte de plus à chaque manche, les gains sont en général de plus en plus importants au cours de la partie et il est tout à fait possible de combler un retard important en une ou deux manches.

Les cartes N sont certainement les plus stratégiques; elles permettent de conserver une carte intéressante ou de passer la main lorsque vous avez déjà rempli votre contrat.

Il est tout à fait possible de jouer à Wizard en utilisant un jeu de 52 cartes (4 couleurs x 13) et en y ajoutant 8 cartes provenant d'un jeu identique dont 4 seront marquées N et les autres Z. Mais j'en suis sûr, les jolies illustrations, le faible coût et le plaisir que procure ce jeu, vous inciteront à l'acquérir au plus vite.

This game is like spades..except no partners...and the trump is random each hand...and wizards (4 of them) are supertrumps.  A typical, trick-taking card game. It gets a bonus half point because it scales well from 4-6 players.

It's been eons since I've played this game.  Played recently and noticed that the game is a bit too chaotic for my taste.  Usually towards the end, players hold onto their Jesters so they can get out of the the lead.  The result is that if you don't have one, you can easily get set by taking a trick because someone leads a Jester to you on the card.  Now your 2 of diamonds takes the hand.  Becomes a bit of a luck fest.  Hard to draw out those jesters early from the player on your right.

Definitely the better choice compared to Skat, although it goes in a similar direction. I prefer this over Skat, because of the better bidding system. Even if you get a crappy hand, you try and can earn some points. You also have to evaluate your hand correctly, no matter how good or bad it is. The wizards and the jokers make for some nice possibilities and free the system up.

Currently my favorite card game. I've played variations of this game dating back to the 60's but Wizard is the best of the lot. The thing that makes it work better are the Wizard and Jester cards... they add just the right amount of randomness and a savvy player can, with skill, use them to bust the plans of their opponents and score well with a poor hand.

For under $10 this is one of the best game values on the market.

Interesting, but kind of long. Probably mostly because people are so damn slow to bid, and then just as slow to play cards. Maybe I'd like this if I played with more confident players.

I dislike progressive hand size games since they reduce the amount of information available, making the tactical part of the trick-taking much less interesting.

On the German edition there is a clear reference to the similar game Rage, and Wizard is basically Rage with the twist of adding jesters and wizard (making it a bit harder to predict your tricks), and more points for guessing right and more deduction for guessing wrong, so if you lose you often lose big time. I prefer Rage, as it seems to me that there is a higher chance to actually predict how many trick's you'll win.

I'm starting to see some of the flaws with this game.  The way the scoring works, you have to bid high to win.  Hitting bids of zero doesn't get you anywhere fast.  The only problem is, you can't just go bidding up willy nilly without the cards for it.  You can only bid what's in your hand.  If you don't get the right cards, you don't win.  Add to that the chaos of not all cards being accounted for MOST of the game.  I dunno.  Not my favorite anymore.

Interesting trick taking game with an almost standard deck of cards. I enjoy the fact that the entire deck is not used every hand, which will minimize the card counting ability of experienced players. That being said, this game still rewards skillful bidding and play.

After another few plays, I'm really against the bidding payout in Wizard. If you're not dealt a wizard or two, you are going to have problems bidding high enough to stay in the game. I find the Oh Hell scoring (10 plus the number of tricks won, 5 plus the total number of tricks in the round for a zero bid, nothing for a missed contract. When you play with the Amigo wizard rules, IMO the game suffers from 'crappy hand syndrome.'

RATING: 8
Great adaptation of the classic "[gameid=1116]" or "Up and Down the River".  A trick taking game that involves bidding, and skilful play of cards.

Differences from Oh Hell:
- addition of Wizards/Jesters: some argue this makes it harder to plan and so undermines strategy
- bids are not simultaneous
- scoring difference
a) you lose 10 points for each trick above/below your bid); this makes the game less forgiving and more challenging, since people who are leading will lose points if they play poorly
b) you don't just get points for getting your bid but also for each trick - this encourages you to go for bids with tricks, since they earns substantially more points than a winning bid of zero; on the other and it unfairly disadvantages people with poor hands
c) in later rounds there are more cards and thus increased chance of catching up
In short: Oh Hell is "safer", and the more skilful player can just play conservatively with low bids to win consistently, Wizard is a bit more unpredictable and this makes it easier for players behind to catch up, it has a bit more randomness about it and is less precise

Some play "screw the dealer", the total number of tricks bid by the players may not equal the number of tricks available on that hand, which means at least one player will fail on each hand.
Similar is the official but optional "Canadian" rule: "If the last player to bid has the highest score recorded on the score pad (not tied for the lead) he/she cannot bid so as to make the bids "even" unless the bid made is "zero". The dealer can bid zero at any time even it makes the bids 'even'.(An "even" bid is when the total tricks bid equals the total tricks available.) "
This rule is used in all Wizard tournaments, and is especially important for the last hand of a game, because it forces the leading player to bid something other than what they might otherwise bid (otherwise the leader is more likely to coast to a win by making the bids "even".)

Suggestion: use bidding stones so that people are not continually asking "How many did you bid?"

13 hands may be a bit too much, perhaps shorten it

A trick-taking game with a special element where each turn you get one more card in your hand. So, start with 1 card on turn one, then 2 on turn two, 3 three, etc. till you have, like, 10 cards at the end. I get what they're going for in that playing a trick-taking game with variable hand sizes requires a variety of approaches, but the inclusion of special cards (wizards, jesters) mean even the best planning is undone by someone else's special card. If there's skill to employ here, I'd be surprised; seems too chaotic.

I'm normally not so fond of trick-taking games, but this one I certainly like. It has a good skill/luck rate and by the end of each round the tension rises on whether you are going to get your predicted amount of tricks or not. It even often becomes contra-intuitive as you could be forced not to attempt winning tricks while you're holding the cards to do so. Especially the rules on the wizards & jesters make for interesting tactical play. And the artwork is simply stunning for a simple card game !

Wizard is based on (in fact, nearly identical to) Oh Hell!, which by the way is possibly the best game ever invented for a standard 52-card deck.

The big change is that Wizard adds eight new cards to the deck, including four super-trump "wizards". I suppose having super-trumps isn't such an awful thing, especially if you're designing a game specifically for children, but here's the kicker: The wizards ignore all rules about following suit. Nothing can stop you from playing a wizard if you have one, and nothing can make you play a wizard if you have any other cards available.

What this does is remove the flow of the game. Oh Hell! is a game of predicting and influencing flow; you try to guess how the various suits will pan out, and if you think someone else has a card that will ruin your plans, you can try to force it out of their hand. But a player with a wizard can reroute the game at will.

Part of me wants to rate Wizard a 1 as a kind of penalty for taking a great game and making it so much worse. But I have to be honest: I've played Wizard (because someone else asked me to), and it's definitely bearable. I rate Oh Hell! an 8 and Wizard a 3.5.

A variation of Oh Hell, which adds 4 Wizards (always high) and 4 Jesters (always low) to the standard deck.  One of the most popular non-gamer group games I play.  The extra cards (which need not follow suit) change the flavor of the game significantly, making it much harder to intentionally flush out cards.  One problem with the game is that it tends to be very hard to catch up once you fall behind.

A very small tweaking of the public domain card game Oh Hell, adding eight special cards that can be played without following suit.  The new cards heighten the drama and ability to bluff, but also heighten the luck of the draw.  On balance, the changes accentuate the strengths of a game that is all about "playing the players."  I recommend skipping the first few hands, which are too small to be interesting.  I also like the "screw the dealer" optional rule that ensures that at least one player will fail his bid each round.

Wizard is an Oh Hell variant where the only difference is that there are some extra cards in the deck that increase the power of luck of the draw AND make card counting harder.

A seemingly straight-forward trick-taking game that is very similar to Oh Hell!. I grew up playing games like this with my family, so I thought I was pretty adept at most of them. Unfortunately, I did abysmally at this one. I'm more than ready for a rematch.

The game uses a standard four-suit deck (newer versions have custom suits) with an added four Jesters (lowest, non-suited card) and four Wizards (highest, non-suited cards). The first round, each player is dealt a single card. Everyone bids whether or not they'll take the one trick available. Each subsequent round, an additional card is dealt, until you reach the point where all cards are dealt.

The scoring is simple but interesting. You get 20 points for making your bid, plus 10 points for each trick taken. If you fail your bid, you lose 10 points for each trick you missed it by, whether over or under. This means that making a large bid can help your score a lot, but also just barely missing a large bid doesn't hurt you too much. Also, bidding zero rewards the same no matter how many tricks there are in a round, which is unusual.

I think what killed me in this game was failing to recognize the power of the Wizards. They always take a trick, and never have to follow suit, which basically makes them like bombs in Tichu. There were many hands in which I either failed to account for them in other people's hands, or failed to use them properly when they were in mine.

Overall, I thought it was a really good game, and I expect my rating will go up with more plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

After one play it seems quite difficult to predict but I'm sure with more plays the tactics will become clearer and it will become easier. My kind of card game.

I'd rather play another card game than this one.
The main problem in my view is that the scoring system is overly weighted to a player's ability to *exactly* predict how many tricks they will take. Only then can you get a positive score for the hand. All other cases are negative. Would be good to have less of a dichotomy.
Wizard cards definitely have a strong influence, and getting them (or not) makes a difference in being able to (incrementally) build up your score.

I enjoy trick taking games quite a bit, and this one adds a bit of chaos to the mix by throwing in ultimate trumps (wizards) which the first person to play can win with, as well as ultimate losers (jesters) which you can almost never win with. The fact that neither Wizards nor Jesters are suited, and can legally break the 'must follow suit' rule, means you can be a bit more strategic with what you play, but winning/losing bids are much more subject to the chaos of what's in other people's hands.

RATING: 6
This is essentially a 52-card deck, with eight additional special cards--4x Wizards and 4x Jokers. Why would anyone spend money on this game, when you can put one together from two standard playing card decks? The game is a trick-taking game, much like Spades, Hearts, or Bridge. Scoring is based on predicting and fulfilling how many tricks you're going to take each round, which starts out at a single-card deal, but progresses one card every deal, until ten deals have been made, where the final deal is dealing out ten cards to each player in a six-player game. If I want to play card games, I will play card games, but it seems criminal to charge people money for what is essentially a slightly larger card deck and a trivial concept. This seems to take the trick-taking concept, and happened to slap several rules to it. Unimaginative and uninspiring.

Update (11/08/10): Who am I kidding, in all likelihood I will never play this again. But, if you held a gun to my head, I'd play.

Absolute best implementation of the [gameid=1116] (et al.) family.

Since we play with a deck bashed together from several "Dragon Back" Bicycle decks, the Wizards glide on ramps of moonlight and execute breathtaking 540 Cabs and Superman Seat Grabs that conjure up hosts of devils with which to have congress; meanwhile, the happy-go-lucky Jester biffs it on his first Bunny Hop and ends up in the ditch, crying [i]a-bloo-bloo-bloo[/i] on account of having lost toes in the spokes.  You'd stop to help him but, you know, he smells like pee.

PS. Always, [i]always[/i] play with the "Drunken Canadian rule" whereby the dealer cannot make a bid that brings the total number of bids = to the number of tricks in the hand.  This way someone is [i]guaranteed[/i] to get served up a platter of finger sandwiches—no, [i]really[/i]—[i]finger[/i] sandwiches.  Most probably made from [i]their own fingers[/i].

Won a copy of this from playing in a tournament at a convention. Have played this for many years prior, though, with family and friends. Lives up to it's slogan as the "Ultimate Game of Trump", as it truly is one of the best in the genre. Essentially a modified version of the classic and appropriately named "Oh Hell!", it succeeds it with the extra cards making a mathematically ideal deck of 60 cards, easily divisible for 2-6 players. The wizards and jesters also simultaneously help make the game both more chaotic and more strategic. Overall, it's great, and one of favorite card games out there.

This is the trick taker of choice for my family. It's fairly swingy, but the amount of chaos is enjoyable with a table of players who aren't taking it too seriously. If I'm with a group that I think would like other trick takers, I will very rarely suggest this. If I'm with a group that aren't big gamers, this will likely be the game I recommend.

Wizard is based on the classic trick-taking card game. The theme of fantasy game is smoothly decorated the game. Comparing with other trick-taking games, the game, Wizard, is dependent on betting and wagering on scoring. Players have to guess how many tricks he or she can win in round. The round betting is the most attractive part of the game. However, this game is not really suitable for beginner's level. Although the game rules and mechanics are easy, players have to speculate, estimate and calculate many factors throughout playing game. Without this difficulties, this game is a wonderful choice for someone who loves trick-taking games.

Wizard is a favorite lunch-time card game at work.  It plays in about an hour and scales decently, although the game definately changes with the number of players; 3-4 offers more control, while with 5-6 things can get chaotic.  We play with blind bids recorded at the start of the hand.

Israelis play Oh Hell (they call it "Whist") like it's going out of style. They don't like this, as they have OH figured out. The 60 card deck makes it easier to add and subtract players and the scoring is more forgiving than Israeli Whist. Good game.

What a surprise game, I have never played trick taking games and, now, I love them. I really like that you can bluff and (try to) manipulate the other players.

Wizard is a light medium game, easy to teach but it has a surprising depth and lots of interesting decisions so I´m hooked. Perhaps the game is a bit long (even more if you don’t have any chance at winning but you have to continue to play the last rounds).

For me, one of the best trick taking games out there.

I have cooled a lot toward the trick taking games genre, I have sold most of the games I had in this category, however, I don’t think I will ever sell Wizard. It was the first trick taking game I played and it has a special place in my heart.

The game decisions aren’t obvious (a huge plus for me) and the clickers this edition has, work very well and are lots of fun.

I bought the Wizard: The Christmas Wizard expansion only to realize it isn’t compatible with my copy of the game :cry:. That edition has better art (in fact it HAS art because this edition is played with a standard card deck).

Bottom line, a good game I want to play from time to time. I’m downgrading Wizard´s rating so it matches my current feelings for the game with BGG´s recommended rating system.

The more I play this game, the more I like it.  Bidding for tricks appears to be easy, but we ocasionally play with the rule that the number of tricks bid can NEVER equal the number of tricks available so there is always going to be at least one bid that will fail.  

A great filler game and an easy game to teach.

Who would've thought adding 8 cards to a deck would create such an interesting game?  Wizard is a basic trick-taking game with betting which changes one thing:  The trump can be trumped.  It's one of the most unpredictable card games I've ever played.  As someone who grew up on card games, I don't know why this one never hit the table.  It's now going to be permanently in reach of my person everywhere I go.  I really like it.

It reminds me of Oh Hell in that you are supposed to call how many tricks you'll take on each hand. The addition of two types of cards; Wizards that always win tricks, and Jesters that always lose tricks make the game a little less fun.

This is trick taking turned sideways a little. Great little scalable game using essentially standard cards with 2 extras. Very easy to explain and takes one sample turn and everyone is ready to play. It's cool how the choice of bids gets harder the further in the round and new people start to get the hang of it.

"Oh Hell!" with two additional cards: the Jester & the Wizard.  A bidding trick taking game in which bidders must take the exact numbers of tricks bid, otherwise you are set.  The game really needs 5 or 6 to have meaningful play.  4 is not recommended, 3 is interminable. 

Skull King has knocked this one down a few pegs from a 7.5 to a 6.  Skull King is the game Wizard aspired to be

A trick-taking game with a twist. Somehow, I can't help thinking what this game would be like, if players would decide the amounts of tricks in secrecy and then show the number to everybody at the same time before each round. But, a good game as it is. Luck and tactics nicely mixed, but hitting leaders is almost impossible and it's really hard to get back up and running once you have fallen behind in points. Sometimes it can be a bit chaotic because of the Wizard cards.

In Euchre you're rewarded for getting 3 tricks (more if you can secure them all). In rook you're trying to secure a certain number of points (anything after is profit). In spades you get a 1/10th of the points after securing your initial bid, and are only penalized for each missing trick you bid on. In Wizard (52 standard card deck + 4 each of the special "Wizard" and "Jester" cards), you're penalized for anything but being absolutely spot on with your bid. This creates such a unique element in terms of how to lead/play during the hand. Great trick taking/bidding game.

A trick-taking game in the vein of Spades except that the trump can change from round to round, and each round can an increasing number of tricks per hand (starting from 1 card until all the cards are dealt out).  It also includes 2 special cards which can take any trick or no trick at all.

Light weight.

Das Stichansage Spiel!
Ein Stichspiel, bei dem man vor der Runde ansagt wieviele Stiche man macht. Wenn man es schafft erhält man Punkte, ansonsten erhält man Minuspunkte...
4 Farben, eine davon Trumpf und 2 Sonderkarten (Zauberer gewinnt immer, Narr verliert immer).
Sehr schönes Spiel. Damals überhaupt nicht gefallen, gefällt es mir heute total gut!

RATING: 4
Played only on BSW. Middle of the road trick taking game. While there are a couple of twists, a couple, like starting right from a one-card hand, are bad. All in all, Wizard compares poorly to Sticheln and especially the related Ninety-Nine. Due the game's structure, this is probably best with 4-5 players.

UPDATE: Played a few more games, and, well, it's pants, as the English say. The ability to play a Wizard whenever you feel like it, even if you would otherwise have to follow suit, blows all of the skill out of the water. It is almost impossible to string together tricks with anything but Wizards. Beyond that it's just a crapshoot. Even card counting is of marginal use.

Oh, and the fact that being dealt hands that let you bid big is stronger than making small bids consistently is the final nail in the coffin. With a better scoring system, this could [i]almost[/i] be worth playing.

A nice variant in the trick-taking card game genre, there is a nice mix of risk analysis, judging the table, juggling power cards and a healthy dose of luck.  A lot of players see the value of the all-powerful wizard card, but after a while, the use of the Jester to save you from winning an unwanted trick (or losing a needed power card) becomes more and more clear.  The requirement for absolute accuracy in your bid (losing points for making too many or not enough) was a great decision and makes for very different tactical situations depending on the need for tricks at the table. It is hard to come back from some early setbacks and the take that aspect of the game may not appeal, but once in a while it is a fun and usually rowdy time.

Like mixing 500 (or "up and down the river"), Xactika, and Five Crowns.  Trump is selected Euchre-style by a random card draw.  I prefer card-games in which there is bidding for trump, as in Pinochle.  TTFN

Played a version with my family called Up and Down the River. Also known as Oh Hell. Fun with or without the added wizards & jesters. I like the scoring method where you get 20 if you make your bid and then get +10 for every trick. Otherwise you get negative 10 per trick you missed your bid by.

Might be the king of trick-taking games for me.  Just don't play with that awful european deck with the fantasy illustrations, Wizards represented by "W's" and Jesters represented by "N's", in two letters that in the font used are the same letter rotated!  The standard deck version if very useable in contrast.  Scales so well from 3 to 6, it's amazing.

In diesem Kartenspiel geht es darum, im Voraus die Anzahl der persönlichen Stiche vorherzusagen und diese dann auch tatsächlich zu erreichen. Ungewöhnlich ist, dass in der ersten Runde bloß mit einer einzigen und anschließend stets einer zusätzlichen Karte gespielt wird. Ausgespielte Farben müssen bedient werden. Wer die Farbe nicht besitzt, darf eine andere Farbe oder einen Trumpf abwerfen. 
Am Ende wird abgerechnet. Die richtige Vorhersage der Anzahl Stiche wird belohnt, dagegen werden Abweichungen von der Ansage mit Minuspunkten bestraft.

RATING: 8
Wizard is the perfect trick-taking game -- superior to both Hearts and Spades, and unbelievably vicious when played with "screw the dealer" in effect.

The concept is simple, as is the core gameplay; Wizard is easy to teach, with the idea of succeeding by taking zero tricks generally being the only thing that takes new players a couple hands to get used to. It usually stays tense right up until the end, because even large leads can erode quickly if you bid a high number of tricks and miss just one of them later on in the game.

In many years of playing Wizard, I've only found two negatives: with three players, it's too long (with four or more, it's great); and as with most card games, skill can't always make up for consistently boring draws, which occasionally results in a game where you do well but can't possibly do well enough to win.

RATING: 7
A really fun trick-taking game. Since bidding accuracy is necessary to gain points, there's less of a chance element (i.e. less benefit to strong hands), and skillful play for control and prediction is rewarded. I also like the jester and wizard cards. And you can also skew bids by burning tricks / burning others' winners with these cards, so more aggressive play is possible (definitely a variety of winning strategies is possible).

Arguments between spouses is a common side-effect though; you've been warned :)

Note that although the game plays 3-6, I'd really just recommend 4-5. 6 is too chaotic (no control), and 3 is overly long and controlled (i.e. less likely to make errors, so hand you are dealt matters much more).

This one has dropped a bit in my ratings now, but only because it's been over-played by my family over a decade. Will still play once in a while, but I feel I've explored what it has to offer. Though with new opponents I did find the game had a bit new life.

Great trick taking game. Simple rules. Fast play.  Plenty of the same 'arg!' factor found in other games like Rage! when you miss your bid.

Unlike Rage you don't get any points for taking tricks when you miss your bid which feels a overly painful and overly rewarding the ones who do.

The number of rounds composing a complete game seems a little large for this kind of game and we rarely play an entire game.

This is thousands of times better than Hearts. I really like the concept of bidding for tricks and being penalized if you're wrong. This creates a lot of angst in trying to capture just the right amount; especially if you later realize that your hand was better than you thought. However I did find that the game lasted a little too long and got repetitive after a while; I would have been happy to play 10-12 hands (instead of 15 for 4 players). Still, this is probably going to hit the table fairly often.

Bizarre game where losing tricks is as important as winning them.  Half the time, someone is trying desperately to win a trick...someone else is trying desperately to lose a trick...and someone else isn't sure what they want one way or the other.  I understand the reasoning behind it, to even out the luck of the deal...but it seemed counter-intuitive.  It would be like in Monopoly, for victory points, having each person guess how much rent they will collect before they next pass Go.  The person closest to the actual number would win points.  Sure it would even out whether or not you have good properties...but it's just so counter-intuitive.  I like it better than euchre though...for whatever that is worth...

DER Klassiker auf unseren Familienfeiern.Wizard spielt irgendwie Jeder gern. Es geht um Karten spielen und Stiche ansagen. Jeder Spieler muss zum Anfang einer Runde genau sagen, wie viele Stiche er bekommen wird. Ein falscher Tipp zieht Minuspunkte nach sich. Ein gutes Spiel, mit grässlichem Artwork in der Standardversion und einer durchaus langen Spieldauer (für ein so simples Kartenspiel).

This is a fun though simple game. Great for many players. We use the so-called "Canadian rules" as printed in the rules--that is, the dealer cannot make the bet even. This rule forces every round to be competitive.

The original Trick-taking game? Dunno, but this is to trick taking what Dominion is to deckbuilders. As close to the essential formula as possible and as bare bones as you'd expect.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
In each round, deal each player the number of cards equal to the round number. Each player estimates how many tricks they will take, and points are awarded or deducted if you guessed correctly. Requires estimation, luck, card counting and an idea of what other people are planning. Not a bad trick taking game.

This is an OK trick-taking game, similar to bid whist but without the partnerships.  This makes the game more flexible, but with exactly four players I'd prefer to play whist.  Nothing really new here, but it's a solid game.

Wizard ist kein spektakuläres Spiel aber im Gegensatz zu anderen Spielen seiner Art wird es nie langweilig. Es landet immer wieder auf dem Tisch und gegen eine Partie habe ich fast nie etwas einzuwenden.

RATING: 5
I found this pretty frustrating as a serious trick-taking game. The limited number of cards in play throughout most of the game and the fact that there are no guaranteed winners (short of the first Wizard card) adds a lot of chaos. I would gladly play again if requested, but in my mind, there are way too many better trick-taking games for this to make the short list.

RATING: 5
Completely by the numbers trick taking game.  Close enough to traditional card games that non-gamers can easily get into it.  The incrementally increasing number of cards per hand is a neat twist, and the only thing that keeps the game from losing its legs.

Gameplay is more erratic than Oh Hell, but because I'm less familiar with Wizard, at this point I'd rather play it than my old childhood fave. It's a slightly different set of mechanics and calculations, perhaps less pure, as Wizards and Jesters alike break cardinal rules of trick taking games. This extra bit of randomization may be off-putting to card game purists, but I'm a fan.

An interesting Oh Hell variant. The wizard and jester cards make it hard to decide exactly how many tricks you can take.

RATING: 7
It's a very basic contract trick-taking game with. Only real differences are 4+4 special cards that can be played instead of following suit. One peculiarity is that you play one trick in round 1, two in round 2, etc. until all cards are dealt to players (for the last round).

Nice "Oh Hell" variant that scales nicely from 4 to 6 players.  Works for 3 but not as well in my opinion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.6
A fairly entertaining game.  Gets a little out of control when played with the full complement of players, but this aspect might make it more attractive to some.  Plays very similar to Rage, though I think I would pick that game over this one in most situations.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
As far as trick-taking games go, Wizard might be one of the most accessible: the set of cards is almost like a standard one (four sets, 1-13 cards on each, four jesters/duds and four wizards/trumps), tricks are taken in a most elementary manner (one card per trick per player, suit is follow but for the jesters and wizards, first wizard played trumps the rest), there are no complicated contracts but single guesses about how many tricks can be achieved and the scoring system is as sleek as it can get (10 points per trick and 20 bonus points if the number of tricks suits the guess, otherwise 10 negative points per trick away from the guess).

There's just one more element in the game, and it is what makes it special: Wizard isn't played with one hand after another and all of them bearing the same cards, but players play first with a hand of one card, then a hand of two cards, then three and so on (the limit depends on the amount of players). This feature ensures that the game moves easily at first and becomes gradually more and more interesting until the last rounds, which are actually very tense and tactical. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Oh Hell is an excellent game in any case. Wizard has given it a sufficient twist to add a little intrigue to the strategy but - crucially - not gone over the top and lost the original game in a mess of new ideas.

One of those games where you do have to wonder how they blagged the publishers into reprinting a deck of playing cards, but who cares? This rarely fails to cause genuine engagement and enjoyment. 

The art, by the way, is utterly hilarious. Regardless of whether you think it's good or bad art, it's just hilarious.

It's been a long time since playing a trick playing game and this was a gem. For some reason, I never played Oh Hell growing up but if this is a derivative of it, I missed out.  I can't wait to play with more than three players.

Some friends had been trying for quite a while to get our game group to play, but we'd always demurred, in my case, because I wasn't too excited by the theme.  We finally gave it a shot, and found this quick, easy, spades-like game to be a lot of fun.

Wizard is a great trick taker that scales well with different numbers of players. It has a great sense of pace as you progress through the rounds. Dropping a Wizard or Jester at opportune or inopportune times can be hilarious.

RATING: 7
I love Oh Hell, but the power of the Z's (uber trumps) and the N's (nulls), both of which can be played anytime, can be quite difficult to predict for. It certainly makes the early hands more of a lottery if you don't have them (not knowing whether someone's going to arbitrarily smack over the top or not, even if you have top card). Great if you have them, as they're the only way to gain control, but they make the game a lighter and less satisfying affair than better Oh Hell variants out there such as Die Sieben Siegel. Still very playable though if you've taken that into account.

simple trick taking game;  Trump randomly decided; One must guess the number of tricks they will take & then
achieve that goal.  Seems reasonably, but Wizard cards throw in too much chaos.

RATING: 5
A typical trick-taking game with trumps, where you have to follow suit. Betting on the exact number of ticks makes it a bit interesting. It features a lot of double-thinking what your opponents will play and try to "break" them. However, it rewards only strong hands; if you start with a pretty weak hand, you're more or less wasted.

This is basically a card game you can play with an ordinary deck of cards instead of the single-purpose deck, and despite the great artwork on the cards, that's my recommendation.  Especially since it's so easy to confuse "Z" (a wizard that always wins) with "N" (a joker that always loses) on the deck we played with.  The rules are nothing special, and essentially waste all that great artwork.

Trick taking games seem to be the most consistentally enjoyable mechanics/themes for me. Not that they'll ever be mind blowing, but a bunch of them in the game box doesn't go astray.

This one is a no-gimmick, straight forward rip off of Oh Hell! Liked the scoring system which increases hand size by one each round, although playing twenty rounds with three players seems a bit much. Recommended for trick taking fans.

After only one play, I think this is an OK game - but this rating has the potential to go up.  The first couple of hands feel a little contrived to create the pattern, but the end game was interesting.  Plus, we all laughed frequently while playing so that should count for something.

(When rating games I focus on the "how likely I am to play this game again" part of the BGG description rating, as opposed to the "quality" part of the rating.)

A straight forward trumping game like spades.  Quite addictive, and good for family conversation.  A favorite of my family...and "cut throat" rules are the best way to play (bidding simultaneously at the beginning of each hand with finger snaps and then requiring the dealer to change her bid if the total # bid equals the total # of tricks available.  Dealer then has option to choose who leads first trick.)

Trick taking game in which you must first declare how many tricks you will take. You lose points if you go over or under your bid. 4 Wizards (always take the trick) and 4 Jesters (always lose the trick) are added to the traditional 52 card deck and are very good to have in hand.

I liked hearts one time but I doubt I would anymore. This felt too much like card game for regular playing cards - though I do prefer playing with these. The game seemed too long - played only 'till round 10 with 4 players. No one got really any of the bids right after round 4 or 5.

My go to card game for 5-6 players. Always looking for good accessible trump games, this one fits the bill. I like that there's enough randomness with the extra high cards to unsettle counting, but not so much (e.g. Rage) that planning is impossible. And you get so much bidding goodness! like 5x as much as any other trump game-- from 1 card hands all the way up--and we all know that delicious pushing your luck analyzing guess of trump bidding is most of the fun of the games.

Don't have the silly illustrated deck version.

For get the 45 minute playing time written on the box. It's closer to double that. A lot of trick taking. I enjoy the predictions, but it's just too long. I prefer Die Sieben Siegel, which is both shorter, more specific with the predictions and has the saboteur role.

RATING: 6
It's like spades without partners and with two special power cards. I'd like it more if it were just spades with the power cards, the lack of partnerships really makes me want to play spades more, though this you can play with any number, and you could easily house rule a spades bidding format.

Nice art but the suit symbols are placed at random.

This has got to be one of my least favorite games. I'm not a fan of trick taking to begin with, but there's actually a round where you play with 1 card, and a trump suit. The art in this version was amusing, but it was pretty annoying that the Null (joker/zero) card was labeled with an "N" and the Wizard card (supertrump) was labeled with a "Z" - which looks exactly like the "N" turned sideways.

Thumbs down.

I am a big of trick-taking card games, especially Rook and Spades.  The addition of the 8 extra cards in this game makes things different enough for me.  I still very much enjoy it.

A solid trick-taking game that can easily accommodate different numbers of people-- probably its best feature.

Quite a nice trick-taking game.  The psychology part of trying to work out who's got what to get their tricks is interesting.  The down-side is the semi-random 'OK, I'll screw someone over' thing that can happen, but it is part of the game and you can deal it out as much as you get it.

Gyerekkoromban nagyon sok Rikiki partit játszottam, ami mindig nagyon jó hangulatban telt családi körben. A Wizard ehhez 4-4 egyedi kártyával tesz hozzá még egy kis érdekességet, de ugyanarról a játékról van szó, illetve ebben csak növekszik a fordulónkénti lapszám. Gyors, mégis kicsit gondolkodós, jó kis kártyajáték.

[2011-09-10]
Úgy érzem 5-en még élvezetesebb, mint 4-en. 6-an még nem sikerült kipróbálni, kíváncsi vagyok úgy hogyan működik.
Emelek egyet a pontszámon, mert az egyik legjobb kártyajátéknak tartom.
Eggyel nőt a paklijaim száma, most már két magyar kiadású Wizardom van.

Good trick-taking game. I've played countless times while growing up. The first couple rounds aren't all that interesting or tactical, but they go by quickly--and there's something to be said for easing players into the game. It can drag a bit at the end, but that's nothing a house rule can't take care of. Oh Hell is arguably a better game than Wizard due to the luck added by wizards and jesters, but Wizard was the game that got me into trick-taking games, still one of my very favourite genres, and I have a soft spot for it as a result.

Pretty standard trick-taking game with a few tweaks: wizards = super-trump; jesters = anti-trump; lose points if don't win exactly the right number of tricks; progressively larger hands, from 1-->15 (in a 4er game).

Of course, the wizard cards are very powerful, but the jesters also give you added flexibility that comes in handy if you&#039;re in danger of being stuck taking an unwanted trick.  I should probably add a bonus point for my wife liking it so much too.

Part of my little card game crave. I was on the hunt for good card games that would fit into little plastic containers. 

Easy to carry around and easy to bring to the table. 
Among these are No Thanks, Love letter, Tichu etc.

Played it with the family ..last weekend was a lot of fun.

2014-11-13 after 2 plays

The combination of trick-taking and skillful betting is very enjoyable in this game. The first few round are a bit too deterministic in my opinion, but those rounds do  serve as a warm up to get into the game. 

My parents loved it. 

Right now it replaced Haggis as the go-to-game to fill up some spare time.

Uitleg op: 
http://boardgamegeek.com/video/10536/wizard/uitleg-review-nl-nox-spellenzolder

Geweldige variant op Boerenbridge of op Rikken.
In dit slagenspel krijg je elke ronde 1 kaart meer. Bij de eerste ronde krijgt elke speler 1 kaart, bij de tweede ronde 2 kaarten enz. De resterende kaarten worden als verdekte stapel weggelegd.

De kaartendeler wisselt per ronde en gaat met de klok mee. De bovenste kaart van de verdekte stapel wordt omgedraaid. De kleur van de kaart geeft de kleur van de “troef” aan. De kaarten van de troefkleur zijn nu hoger dan de andere kleuren. Is de omgedraaide kaart een nar, dan is er geen troefkleur. Is de omgedraaide kaart een tovenaar, dan beslist de deler de troefkleur.

Elke speler, beginnend met de linkerbuurman van de deler, voorspelt hoeveel slagen hij gaat maken. Blijkt de voorspelling achteraf correct, dan krijg je 20 punten plus 10 punten per slag. Heb je het niet goed, dan krijg je 10 minpunten voor elke slag die je van je voorspelling af zit. Wie aan het einde van het spel de meeste punten heeft wint. 

De linkerbuurman van de deler speelt de eerste kaart uit. De andere spelers volgen, totdat elke speler een kaart heeft gespeeld. 
> Een gevraagde kleur kaart moet gevolgd worden!
> Is dit niet mogelijk dan mag een speler troeven of een andere kleur spelen.
> Tovenaarskaarten en narkaarten mogen altijd gespeeld worden, zelfs als een speler de gevraagde kleur kan bekennen! 
> Wanneer een speler met een narkaart (deze is nooit troef) uit komt, dan bepaalt de volgende speler de kleur.

Het spel bevat naast 52 kaarten in 4 kleuren ook 4 tovenaars en 4 narren. Tovenaars winnen gegarandeerd een slag, narren (waarde 0) verliezen een slag. Verder bepaalt de bovenste kaart van de gedekte stapel de troef in de betreffende ronde. 

De slag wordt gewonnen door:
1• De speler die met een tovenaarskaart uitkomt.
    De overige speler mogen daarna zelf bepalen welke kaart ze spelen.
2• De hoogste troefkaart.
3• De hoogste kaart in de gevraagde kleur (waarde 13 is de hoogste, waarde 1 de laagste), indien geen troeven en tovenaarskaarten zijn gespeeld.

[Amigo Spiele 10th Anniversary (2005) edition] {trick-taking, bidding} {basic 6; plus/minus one 6.5; covered bids 6; secret prediction 6; Clairvoyance 6} Oh ehll! is my favorite party game at school when we only have a deck of poker. Thus, Wizard also attracts me as a nice Oh Hell! variant.  It is exciting, fast-paced and has nice player interaction.

Aggressive play is preferred because defensive play won't win; I enjoy games where players have to complete tricks fewer than the total bid. It's a little bit luck driven but it won't hurt the game much because a player can choose the # of winning tricks and the play spans across many hands. However, it's just a joke to play a hand with fewer than 4 cards.

I don't the illustration much. It's too dark and busy for me.

Very addictive trick-taking game.  The more players, the better.  Especially evil when everyone has only one card and two or more people have bid one ...  I actually like the American edition better than the German.  While the artwork on the German version is lovely, it makes the game harder to teach to non-gamers.  Normal-looking playing cards make the game easier to learn.  And, as my current group recently discovered, it's really hard to play the German version in a dimly-lit bar.

Yeah good card game. Basically a fancy-pants whist, but a good one. Only issue is that the extra cards (especially the Wizards) are so powerful that deducing your trick wins at the early stages can be wildly off-track by a higher proportion of Wizards coming in than expected.
Minor niggle but means it is more lucky than most forms of whist.

A good twist on trick taking where you bid on the number of tricks you will win per round, allowing for interesting tactics. Trying to lose a hand can be just as hard as winning one, especially when you're trying to nail your bid. The play length, however, felt too long. I would want to cut out some early and/or late rounds.

[thing=1465][/thing] is a nice trick-taking game, in which the players get more cards at each passing round, and have to bet in how many tricks he/she will win. In the early rounds, luck plays a huge part - if the player open the trick with a color you don't have, you are either screwed or saved, because everyone will have 1, then 2, then 3 cards in hand - also, if the luck to get the trump color (decided at random), you have a high chance to win one or more tricks.

If the player manage to win exactly as many tricks as said, he/she will get 20 points + 10 points per trick won. If the player was off the mark, he/she will lose 10 points for every trick above or bellow the number, [-]but still will get the 10 points per trick won. I don't liked the bonus point for trick won, because, say you bet you will win 5 rounds, and win 7. You will lose 20 points and gain 70, for a total of 50 points. So the hands in which you get high cards, it always pay to bet high[/-] - only that, you know, this isn't true - the owner teached us the game wrong regarding this - the player will only lose points if the bet isn't right, and this is a good thing. So though I still enjoy the way [thing=64080][/thing] deals with the points and penalties, it can't, by now, say that the way it happens in [thing=1465][/thing] is better or worse.

[thing=1465][/thing] has a nice art and with only two special cards (the Wizard and the Fool) is really easy to teach.

However, the game lasted way too long (closer to 90 minutes), and even though it was fun (but more because of the people than the game itself), I recommend that the game starts alreay in the 5th round (every player receiving 5 cards), when the bets are more meaningful.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Every round is a new challenge, as you have to recalculate your bid based not only on what cards you are dealt, but also on total of possible tricks in a round and what everyone else may be plotting. The score sheets that come with the deck are tiny, so I took the advice of buying the bigger score sheets available as after-market.

Played once. Found it irritating. Don't see what the Wizard and Jester cards add to Oh Hell!

I think part of the problem is that it seems like you really need to already know how to play standard trick-taking games reasonably well before you can hope to jump into Oh Hell, which I don't. And in any case this makes the game a poor choice to make into a proprietary version such as this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
When I want to play a fun trick-taking game that anyone can get into quickly (not Tichu), this is my go to.  The mechanic where players simultaneously bid on the number of tricks they are planning to take this turn really makes this game stand out.  In addition to that the Wizards and Jesters add just enough flavor to keep the game engaging but not so much that the average player is confused.  I also love that it works well for 3-6 players, unlike a lot of trick-taking games which restrict to 4 players.  I have enjoyed it for many years and continue to do so today.

Bought a copy after hearing my best friend describe playing it with his family under a different name. I might have a chance of getting this to the table!

Edit: Holy crap, this is fun! When explaining it to a table full of people, the reaction was "Oh, so it's Spades?" which I followed with a "Yes, but..." and proceeded to describe the differences. Played once with three, and the 20 hands seemed like a bit much (though the final no trump hand certainly was interesting). I could definitely see this being awesome for 4-5.

So glad I bought this!

I'm not great fan of trick-taking games, but after 1 play, I think Wizards might even be my favorite of the genre. I really like the structure of the game: its quite straightforward first (only 1 card dealt), but gets more complicated after each round. Also, you get more points each round on average as the game progresses, which is a nice touch.

Trick-taking card game. This is a variant of the game we called "Scratch" where I grew up - I have since discovered it is commonly called Oh Hell. The idea is to predict the exact number of tricks you will take that hand - the dealer being forced to make a bid that will cause at least one player to fail. A remaining card is flipped to determine the trump suit (aces signify no trump) and you have to "follow suit" the standard way. The novelty  is with the specialized Wizard & Jester cards, which allow you to forgo following suit - Wizards are always the highest trump card while Jesters are the lowest cards. Game is played over multiple rounds in which the number of cards dealt is increased or reduced by 1. Scales well for different player numbers. I own an early 90's deck composed of traditional cards with the addition of the W and Je cards (4 each, in a blue non-suited color).

Inferior 'Oh Hell!' variant.  The wizards definitely seem to remove strategy rather than add.  Also, 20 points tricks seems inferior to 10 points tricks (or, giving 0 points for winning a 0 bid) because the other scoring systems reward taking the risk of bidding more.  I do like the fools, though.

There's simply too many rounds to it for how shallow the gampelay and strategy are. There's some fun in making the bids and getting the correct amount of tricks but there's way too much shuffling and dealing and bidding between the rounds.

I don't like the progressive number of cards per hand (it takes the game from chaos to order, but slowly), or the super-trump ability of the Wizard cards.  It skews how one predicts tricks, and I struggle with accuracy because of it.  Also, the values of the tricks themselves is very high, making the "exact bid only" nature of the game less relevant to the final score.  I understand there's a public domain game where tricks score 1 point apiece, and I might prefer the game in that guise.

A solid trick taking game. Similar to Die Sieben Siegel which I prefer and am keeping, so this one has ended up on the sell/trade list.

RATING: 7
Trick-taking trump card game, where wizards always win and jesters alway lose.  Similar to Rage, players must predict exactly how many tricks they will win in hand.  Full games can last a while, but are very enjoyable.

I'd like to have a go-to trick taking game but this one feels like it drags on far too long...especially when one (or more) players have been mathematically eliminated.

I like trick taking games and this one is a good one. The wizards and the jesters add a little variety to standard games. Similar to Oh Hell.

Played several times on BSW (with 3 to 6 players). An interesting twist on what I used to play under the name of "whist", but I don't really like the wizards and the jesters. Being able to play them anytime is nice, however the wizards can make predicting one's number of tricks too chaotic.

Wizard macht echt Spaß und ist strategischer als es Aussieht. Aber so strategisch es ist umso unberechenbarer ist es auch. Das macht das Spiel auch weitestgehend aus. Ich finde es ist ein gutes und lustiges Kartenspiel, das jeder schnell verstehen kann.

RATING: 3
Basic trick taking game, with a small addition: Wizard cards that win the round regardless of the color played or current trump, and Jesters that always lose. 
Not a big fan of the art.

The strategic differences hand to hand are so vast and a bit AP-inducing for some.  It's not a knock, just an observation.

Super fun game.  May rank up w/Tichu for family competitive card games. 

Easy as hell to teach, too

Better game than Oh Hell!, with the jesters adding more control and the wizards adding a bit of uncertainty.  I really like this game and can see it coming out a lot more after getting bored with Tichu.  Still, Tichu > Mu > Frank's Zoo > Wizard for the time being.

In Ukraine (where I'm from) this game is called pocker. And you can play it with ordinary cards. But, marketing is a good thing :)

Simply the best pure trick-taking card game there is. A slight tweak to the deck by introducing Wizards (super-trump) and Jesters (less than trump) creates an entirely new gameplay dynamic. This is truly a fantastic game for any level "card" game player.

A quality trick taking game. That 60 is not the size of a standard card deck is one of history's greatest oversights.

Played it on BSW.  Without the Jester and Wizard cards I know this game as "Screw Your Neighbor" or "Up and Down the River".  Great game to play with a group, however, I don't like the addition of the special cards, nor do I care for the way the scoring is done here.  So I deducted a point and a half from an otherwise fun trick-taking game.

Great trick-taking game based on Oh Hell...bidding with an experienced group is almost as much fun as playing out the tricks themselves.

Trick-taking game; basically Spades with a small twist.

I like Wizard cuz it's easy to play with a group of non-gamers.  Light and fun and it seats up to six players.

RATING: 6
A card game in the [gameid=1116] family, but with fabulous, panoramic illustrations.  For some reason, the Wizards keep me from estimating my bids nearly as well as I do in other such games.  I think that Wizard's escalating scoring system works rather well.

После первой игры.

Филлер - красивейшие карты, в по смыслу: нужно угадать количеств взяток, а потом не особо облажаться, играя по-одной карте (как в переферансе). - иногда брать, иногда нет.

Almost exactly like the game 'Up and Down' played with a regular deck. Just the Wizards and Jesters mixed in and they certainly make the game different, though not better nor worse. A nice good game anyway.

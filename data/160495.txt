An interesting combination of mechanics ans scoring.  I think the random card draw (particularly in the first couple rounds) might be too swingy for the depth I'd like.  I have not played the variable player powers yet, not sure how I would auction them (and I've mostly played with at least one new player anyway).

RATING: 7
1.5 plays / 2 players

LIKE: Good puzzle mechanism and tableau building with the cards. Somewhat smooth gameplay, but ends up a huge decision tree. Theme is mildly integrated to the gameplay. I really like the end-game goal scoring, it's different and competitive.

DISLIKE: Can feel overly complex with the cube management, and a lot to keep track of. Forgetting combos or a scoring area is costly for first time players.

OVERALL: Gives a good brain burn. Can feel like a complex game for complexity's sake with the cube movement on player boards, but not a huge issue. The theme does feel integrated, so a few plays could wear off complexity, thus making the game feel more interactive than a solo puzzle. Good with 2,3 players. (Rating increased.)

JU-E-GA-ZO euro mezcla de acciones y combos, con cartas y tablero. Creo que es uno de los mejores juegos de la editorial y sin embargo ha pasado mucho más desapercibido que otros. Con reglas sencillas y pocos símbolos que lo hacen independiente del idioma, han creado un juegazo de una buena profundidad. Probado sólo a 4. Y también a 2! Y escala muy bien! Incluso a 2 puedes jugar más con el tema de usar carta de número superior o inferior mejor. En serio, JUEGAZO de los mejores Eurogames.

Finally got this to the table, and certainly lives up to its parentage (WYG? games generally).  It will take many more plays to completely explore the depths of this game, but I really enjoyed how fresh the game play felt as compared with the 'standard' formula for heavy games.  

Looking forward to repeated plays, including expanding into the alternate player boards with their asymmetric benefits.

1st play: Very heavy, lots of moving parts. Interesting theme and the card draws create interesting engine building. I like the spatial aspect of the board, but I do feel like it's a lot of effort to place anything on the board. Interesting game, wondering how the second play will go.

2nd play: This game has a lot going on. Lots of actions and chains to consider, a little bit of luck in drawing the right cards, but plenty to consider, and bad luck with the cards won't screw your game. Very complex, so beware AP players, but in my group, an enjoyable experience.

Not a lot to say after a single play, aside from acknowledging the depth of the action space. Every round you have 6 cards in your hand, and you have to weigh not just whether to use a card in the tableau or to trigger an action, but in which order to play them, and whether to burn a card of higher or lower value than those already played to the board. I'm not particularly prone to AP, but even this ground me to a halt. 

Game goes pretty quick with two, even with this consideration.

Το 220πΧ ο αυτοκράτορας Ying Zheng κατέκτησε και τις τελευταίες πόλεις κράτη. Θέλοντας να ενοποιήσει και να δώσει κοινή ταυτότητα στην Κινέζικη αυτοκρατορία, χώρισε την γη σε 5 επαρχίες και προσπάθησε να εφαρμόσει κοινή γλώσσα, νόμισμα και νομοθεσία. Και εμείς καλούμαστε να πραγματοποιήσουμε το όραμα του. :)

Υπάρχουν 6 actions και κάθε παίκτης έχει το προσωπικό του ταμπλό που χωρίζεται σε 5 περιοχές. Εκεί λοιπόν στέλνουμε τους αντιπροσώπους μας, τους μετακινούμε από περιοχή σε περιοχή, τους βάζουμε να στρατολογήσουν εργάτες για το Σινικό τείχος, χτίζουμε το τείχος, χτίζουμε παλάτια, και τέλος μπορούμε να βάλουμε κυβερνήτη σε κάποια επαρχία.

Στόχος μας φυσικά είναι να σκοράρουμε τα περισσότερα VP ικανοποιώντας τις επιθυμίες του αυτοκράτορα, κερδίζοντας majorities στις επαρχίες στο κεντρικό ταμπλό, και από end game κατηγορίες ανάλογα με τα bonus των κομματιών του Σινικού τείχους που επιλέξαμε να χτίσουμε. 

Ο κεντρικός μηχανισμός του παιχνιδιού είναι απλός και αφορά το παίξιμο των 6 καρτών που έχουμε κάθε έτος. Παίζουμε μια στη σειρά μας κάθε φορά, είτε σαν νόμο σε κάποια επαρχία στο ταμπλό μας (δίνοντας μας έτσι πόντους ενοποίησης αλλά και δωράκια όταν ενεργοποιούμε κάποια από τα 6 βασικά actions) είτε εναλλακτικά παίζουμε την κάρτα μας στο discard pile στην αυλή του βασιλιά και επιλέγουμε ποιο action θέλουμε να κάνουμε. 

Να σημειώσω πως οι επαρχίες αντιδρούν στην προσπάθεια ενoποίησης και στην στρατολόγηση εργατών. Αποτέλεσμα είναι να ανεβαίνει ο unrest δείκτης και ανάλογα με το πόσο το πιέσουμε μας απαγορεύει να χτίσουμε παλάτια σε εκείνη την επαρχία ή μας απενεργοποιεί όλα τα abilities-δωράκια μέχρι να καταστείλουμε με κάποιο τρόπο τους αντιδραστικούς. :ninja:

Να πω την αλήθεια σου παίρνει 1-2 γύρους για να καταλάβεις τι ακριβώς γίνεται και πως αλληλεπιδρούν τα actions μεταξύ τους. Αλλά άπαξ και γίνει το κλικ μετά όλα είναι ξεκάθαρα χωρίς υποσημειώσεις και εξαιρέσεις.
Στα αρνητικά να βάλω πως το theme είναι επιφανειακό, όχι ότι περίμενα κάτι διαφορετικό.  

Όταν βλέπω στημένο ένα παιχνίδι της Whats Your Game με το χαρακτηριστικό artwork, γνωρίζω ότι θα παίξω κάτι αξιοπρεπές. Το ZhanGuo δεν απογοητεύει.

As it is more based in mechanics than theme, the functions of the game may not always be intuitive. However, the iconography is well done in helping you remember how things work.  The layout is lovely. An enjoyable, purely euro game. I prefer 3 player over 4 player. I have not yet played 2 player, but I think I would like it.

For good reason one of the top 3 games in Fair Play's Essen'14 scoring.

Strategically deep and tactically challenging. 
Various paths to victory and lots of interaction. What makes this a special for me is also that for a "heavy euro" (it is less heavy than Madeira considering the rules, but just as challenging), the difficulty and interaction ramps up nicely and doesnt kill you in the first round. Also, "mistakes" at the start can be corrected later by adjusting the strategy. Highly recommended!

RATING: 8.5
I've started to really enjoy this type of heavy game, where you have to constantly choose between multiple good actions, and winning depends on careful timing and finding better synergies. Luck of the draw can at certain points in time and given certain combinations of cards be stronger than ideal - but on average it mostly just steers your strategy, and won't matter in the overall game.
I've mostly played this as a 2-player game, and never yet as a 4-player game; I can say that the balance in the game shifts quite a bit dependent on number of players, with fewer players rewarding a longer build up, while more players make moving swiftly on some goals more essential.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A well crafted design.  All actions meaningful and positive.  Interaction such as it is , is through the game mechanisms (as I prefer), not direct.  Cards offer two uses, played on either game board or player's own board.  Playing higher/lower numbered cards to get extra benefits was innovative.  There were a number of other nice design features.  Artwork was first rate - I think Mariano's graphics are the best in the business.  The game could easily have fitted into an Agricola sized box, but then would not have matched the WYG range.  Warning, do not play with anyone who suffers from AP.

Your first plays of ZhanGuo seem like a self-absorbed efficiency puzzle, but once you have a couple of games under your belt it opens up into a game where player interaction is aplenty and may dictate outcomes. The rules are not particularly  complex, but their applications can be somewhat daunting at first. That said, a few games are definitely needed for this game to shine and the flavor to come out. Don't judge it on it's first outing!

The card play, area majority conditions and bonus requirements are unique and innovative. The artwork and production values are excellent. Despite so much going on, the game plays quickly while maintaining you absorbed. The more I play it the more I'm enjoying it's subtleties.

I like What's your game? and this looks like it has some interesting elements. However, some parts seem kind of dry and generic-euroy. I am on the fence on this one.

Update: I received the game in a trade and have played it one 2 player. I enjoyed it a lot actually. The card play makes rounds go quickly and I like the way that actions become more and more powerful throughout the game. There is a nice engine building feel. Some negatives we found were the importance of how your starting hand bonuses combo together and the crazy amount of points obtained through governors. Since governors give you points for end game scoring, an in game reward, and count for so many points at the end they felt a bit overpowered to us.

The rulebook sucks, btw. Jumps from one element to the next without completing one topic first. But you can't help being sucked into the game to try to unify the land and build the wall!

2014. set coll, area ctrl.

Based on DriveThruReview video:
medium to heavy Euro, set coll + area ctrl., overwhelming and AP-prone, points salad or smorgasborg. Simple play a card, tuck it under a column and then take an action. There is a cool hand mgt aspect that sets it apart (maybe flash in the pan); the problem is that you're ham-fisted by the 6 cards you draw with no way to mitigate it aside from solving the best way to play them for the most benefit and least pain (playing a card and only getting a single axns w/o bonuses really stinks and you want to avoid this at all costs). With 4p it's more of a roller coaster (less ctrl.) than with 2-3p.

RATING: 7.7
Perfect for a card-driven board game. Cards you get can be used in different ways and instead of randomness they influence your strategy. Every player has equal resources and equal number of actions. There is limited player interaction, mostly a race for meeting scoring conditions. Still, there are things that you can't predict that can influence your results (e.g. card that other player uses before you).

It's abstract, but it's a good one. Thinky and euroey. Crazy combos. 

There doesn't seem to be a dominant strategy. In 4 games, we have seen a player gun for governors and win. Another stock up on free workers (to build walls and palaces like crazy), and one who stocked on VP cards. They all seem to work situationally. 

Seems to scale well at all player counts.

The concept and the main mechanics skeleton is pretty good, but I cannot help feeling a general sense of chaos in how the rules are arranged. 
The rulebook is complete but in my opinion it fails in stressing the overall view of the player actions (mainly due to a poor choice in rule explanation order probably). 
The point system doesn't allow to easily define a strategy which can focus on chosen aspects of the game, since the mixture of end-game points is too spread. They are too difficult to keep track of during the game, and in some cases just a single component added to the board can drastically change the scoring.
The stacked bonuses of the cards are more difficult to track as the game builds up, since they are spread all around the player board, and I feel it is an uneven price to pay for a column subdivision (by "zones") that is a bit forced.
Last but not least, the overall graphic of the game is quite good, but a lot of terrible choices have been made with the iconography of actions, costs and rewards (a black number meaning "from the same zone", and a red number equally meaning "from DISTINCT zones" OR "from ANOTHER zone"? Really?).
I can understand why someone may love it, After a very detailed study of the rules and of possible choices I think it could become very enjoyable and gratifying. 
But the effort required is probably out of our playing group scope.

Teeters on the edge of being too complex for its own good - with the complexity arising from the range of options available each turn, particularly on the first couple of turns in each round with 4, 5 & 6 cards to play in any order ... brain melt! Rather intimidating on first play, but more experience helps and it was much faster second time round - we positively zipped through the first couple of turns - and rating increased a notch as a result (with a suspicion that more experience might increase that rating further - there's certainly a lot here to explore). 

The first play also demonstrated the value of end game scoring - there's a lot of points to be picked up from palace building in the last couple of turns, once you have a lot of cards out, as well as from Governor majorities, the wall bonuses and that third bonus counter that triples your bonus score.

This game is about moving cubes and scoring points in various ways. The theme is barely there in the game, but the mechanics behind scoring points is done in a clever way (do I play a normal action, or do I want to do something else but get a bonus as well). I do enjoy playing it, although the severe lack of theme dampens it a little.

Once again WMG introduces a heavy brainburning euro – which is normally a genre that is right up my alley, but WMG’s games tend to disappoint me slightly. They are all solid games, but nothing spectacular, and I’m afraid I feel the same way about ZhanGuo, at least after one play.
Now, the game is heavy and there’s a lot to think about, but the rules are fairly simple most of the times, although there are a few areas where I found the rules to be somewhat convoluted. The gameplay is quite simple – you play a card in one of two ways (add it to your own tableau or discard it and take an action, which is boosted by the cards in your tableau).

Usually I'm not a big fan of card tableau building, so that might explain why I wasn’t thrilled about ZhanGuo, but another part of it might be due to the fact that I feel some of the cards are significantly better than others. The hammer is arguably the best action as you need hammers to build palaces and walls which are some of the most important things at all - so if you’re not getting any cards with hammers on them, meaning that you cannot build them in your tableau, you’re going to have a bad time… Because you need to be efficient, and getting extra hammers when taking the strong hammer action is crucial (remember that it’s my experience after just a single play).

I also like the randomization of the setup, meaning that the order and especially where you build palaces/walls change, and it is extremely crucial to think carefully about what to do, when to do it and where to do it. Timing is essential. 
You can make some cool combos with the right cards, and there are a lot to think about! So my rating might be low, but that was partly due to the fact that I didn’t feel there was much I could do… Perhaps it will change with future plays, but I don’t think I will rate this game higher than 7.

I'm giving this game a 10 rating because I enjoy playing it more than 90% of the games I have played - it has very comprehensible rules and yet difficult decisions abound.

Hopefully this has some explanation other than company policy...great game regardless!

First impression was pretty good. It's a heavier card engine building game where players can optimize points from how they use their cards. There seems to be quite a lot of end game scoring and that seems to be where the winner decided. Even though it can run a bit long this one is best with 4.

First play. Very nice point salad game. And a healthy mix of both mid-game and end-game points, although from our first game, it seems like the end-game points is where the winner is decided. This is an engine building game, which feels significantly different from previous WYG games. And for me it doesn't quite reach the lofty heights of the last few from them. But still very good. Maybe great. Need more plays. First play was a bit AP inducing. Not sure whether players will be able to speed it up. There are a lot of downstream ramifications of everything you do, which is general is a good thing. I'm not sure whether the end-game incentives are so strong that players will find it difficult to find niches to drive a local advantage. Hoping that with more plays it can rise to an 8. We'll see.

BGG Secret Santa 2015. Another euro I love! The theme is great, trying to decide how to use your resources is so tense, and the interaction of the multi-use cards with the other players is very engaging. A real winner and so happy we have a copy.

I find this a difficult game to rate because at the core it is an unashamed snowball engine builder, and these games need to be [i]simple[/i] for me to make heads or tails from them. ZhanGuo is simply too many steps too complex, and then my brain shuts down. I don't know why as it happily starts puzzling out all sorts of intricate details in difficult Go-positions... but there we have it. The most definite thing I can say about ZhanGuo is that I am definitely going to avoid big box games issued by What's Your Game? from this point on. Their vision of what constitutes a good game simply does not coincide with my own, and although ZhanGuo isn't as baroque as Madeira and Vinhos, it still is a formidable beast with all the characteristics of little mechanisms tied together just because the authors decided they could. More and more WyG? are turning out to be a publisher of titles which are complex for the sake of complexity, and more and more I am getting put off by such offerings. 

Because I suck so badly at playing these titles, I really cannot use my unpleasant experiences as a yardstick to gauge the game. It seems to be tied together pretty well, that much is obvious. If there is anything I am at this moment not fond of it would have to be the random draw of the action cards. These things have an incredibly important say in how your [i]bonus[/i] actions are going to play out. This is where the game is won or lost, I think: everyone gets 30 actions, but by cleverly arranging what you get at the start of each turn onto your own tableau, in essence creating a string of additional actions to augment a well-defined and simple base action, you can perform [i]much[/i] more. If for some reason the construction of this engine is proceeding less smoothly than that of the opposition, you're pretty much toast. And in a game of this length (the indicated 90 minutes is laughable) I think this pattern is not a particularly welcome thing to have. Of course with less randomness the game would have been rather tough to chew, and probably wouldn't even be around in the shape it currently has.

Another thing I'm not fond of is the end of game-scoring. This is a piece of work which is as opaque as it is intricate. Several commenters have resorted to the dreaded expression [i]point salad[/i], and I'm inclined to agree. This is just a mess, obviously put in place to reward many little routes and side routes and elephant paths. I suppose it comes with the job of wanting to have the game done by the end of 30 main actions, many of which are just setting yourself up for biggies which at some point might actually score. I just find it convoluted as well as confusing.

I think I'm rather lenient with the rate I've given the game.

After a few plays, this really growing on me. I really like the card mechanics, and the imperfect information is exactly what I like in a game. The gameplay is smooth, but with a lot to consider. I love the way the game unfolds as early game decisions have impacts down the road that you couldn't predict. Every game is insanely close, which makes me wonder if there is something funny going on in the underlying mathematics. Time will tell.

[Nov 2016] - 8.25 (4 plays)
Quality medium weight euro all about building a tableau with bonus action chaining in order to accomplish more goals with fewer turns and resources. Takes a little time to get the card mechanisms down and a few more plays to see all the cards and options that are available. Players don't directly interact but you often play cards or take bonuses just to deny others (there aren't any really bad options). You need to really do a bit of everything in order to win.

 This is a rules-heavy Euro with a lot of fiddley end-game scoring.  It has similarities with [thing=162082][/thing], another Essen 14 game, with card play determining actions and card play building a tableau of permanent advantages.  

But Deus does it a lot more elegantly and plays a lot quicker.  I bought this on pre-order as the publisher is a pretty reliable source of good games.  But I am not convinced this has lasting value.  Not with the superior Deus breathing down its neck.

I was hooked on the interesting card play in the game, so I nabbed a copy of this game in a trade. In practice, the different card effects were cool, but the timing of playing them (high/low number) never panned out to be much other than situational.

The game is a thinker, but it just never dug into me to want to play it again.

RATING: 7.5
This is a fairly simple game (that doesn’t take long to teach) yet offers some very nice “build the engine or run the engine” decisions. You have a choice each turn to a) play a card to your tableau which will set you up for bonus actions later or b) take a main action and (potentially) trigger the bonus actions you've already set up for yourself. The thrust is building a tableau of bonus powers while making sure you save enough of your actions to actually use said powers. 

You play 6 cards a round for 5 rounds (30 actions each game). When you take a main action instead of playing a card to your tableau, the number on the played card may trigger a bonus power, so you have that consideration when playing your cards as well. The point of your activity is to claim VP spots on the board before others do. 

On the downside, we’re finding that players who get dealt a hand of cards with similar bonus actions are able to make a much more efficient bonus power engine than those who have a few of each. I mean, if you can take one main action and get 4 bonus actions versus having to take 2 or 3 main actions to get the same effect, well, the game is going to feel a lot easier for you. I’ve been on both sides of getting good hands now and it’s definitely the weak spot of the game. 

My group and I are discussing possible solutions – drafting, deal X+1 at game start and choose, etc. – but we haven’t actually tried anything yet. I’ll update this comment when we do. But in general, I really enjoy playing this game and it hits my euro sweet spot of racing to VPs spots with player interaction provided in the form of who gets there first.

The mechanics are very simple: Either play your card into your tableau in order to boost bonuses, gain influence and potential points later on, or onto the board in order to perform actions and trigger bonuses. Although the mechanics are simple, this is a real brain burner, and maybe unnecessarily complex for my taste. Also, you have to plan for many steps in order to achieve what you want. That is normally ok. But I have rarely played a game where I'm more clueless of the paths to choose from the beginning. 
However, what I really like is the fight over governor majority and the "king's demand points" towards the end of the game.
It's not a simple and genious euro, but definitely something original and exciting.
And one final comment: One of the most fantastic art works I have ever seen. Typically What's Your Game art work, but simply beautiful!

Vicotry point wise everything is connected with everything.
I don't hvave anything against this per se, however, this is one of those games which your really have to play more then just a couple of time to grasp all the interconnection and REALLY start to know what you are doing there.
Problem is: if you don't play it frequently it'S likely that you have to go through the rules all over again before each play. (1 downgrade due to this)

For a game that is at its heart a fairly straight-forward engine building game, the rules for ZhanGuo are unexpectedly (and perhaps unnecessarily?) opaque and convoluted at first. The game does come together after a few turns, however, and provides some interesting choices within a fairly constrained framework. Unfortunately, with the exception of the race for the influence bonus spaces the game is played almost entirely on your own private player board. Those bonus spaces are very important but that doesn't make the game before that any less solitary. A bit of a wasted opportunity in my eyes.

Relativ schlankes Regelwerk ufert in eine komplexere Verzahnung an Möglichkeiten. So auch im angehenden Reich der Mitte, wo Tsching Tschang Tsching Kombi King sein Paravent aufstellt. Im Kern spielt man in jeder der 5 Spielrunden 6 Spielkarten aus - entweder an die eigene, begrenzte Auslage oder als übergeordnete Aktion und verknüpft dann beides effizient zu einer Maschine. ZHANGUO passt nahtlos in die Verlagsreihe, die eine inhaltlich klare, denkfordernde, an Mechanismen orientierte und optisch erkennbare Identität verfolgt, die nicht jedermanns süßes Köpfchen Sache ist.

Fun to build your engine.  Like Signorie, but this one is customizable which makes it more flexible and personal.

Officials, Governers, Palaces, and Wall Pieces all complement each other and contribute to your score providing diverse strategies with the importance of the tasks providing direction.

The journey is fun too.  Card decisions are high quality with enough to choose from no card feels dead.  The competition for the rewards keeps each round's tension tight and provides some nice pacing.

Components: good quality
Complex: easy to learn, probably not easy to master all you can do
Weight: medium
Players: 3 or 4
Length: 1 hour to 1 hour and a half
Mechanics: area control, combo with cards
Decisions: a lot... should I go for some cards in my tableau for later combos, or build something there, what should I build now, are those final scorings interesting...
Opinion: funny medium game with lot of options. You have to help the Emperor with the unification of China, for that you have to build the wall, build palaces and send your governors to the different regions.
The gameplay is easy, you have 6 cards each round, and, in your turn, you play one of them... well to your tableau or to the general one to perform one action. Cards in your tableau help you later with the actions on the general one, as each time you perform and action, depending on the numbers you will have benefits from them.
Many ways of scoring points, and, although the governor VP's seems a lot, you can score in the meantime and with different end goals.
Liked how the end of each round is played, during the round you could get some markers on 3 different colors, and they will be used to claim some rewards in the end, depending if you have the majority, or if the reward is appealing to you you can have it, other way the next player can opt for. This consumes all your markers of that color, and also is relevant for turn order the next round.
With all things you have, the game is easy to learn (just play a card, next one) but all options included in the game make it a nice one to take into account. Obviously you cannot do everything, and this is something I like from games

I really enjoyed everything about this game up until the very end. Man, this game is elegant. So may cool mechanisms here. Play a card to your tableau or the board and if the card number is higher or lower than the previous card played, you may or may not get a bonus and the previous cards you play to your tableau will determine those bonuses. Turn order is also done very well here by forcing the person who won the highest unification prize to go last. Very inventive. But the end game bonus scoring gets a little overwhelming to count wall pieces, then Governors, then emperors demands, etc. It's a bit much with all the hidden scoring and makes me wonder if this is something I need to have in my collection. Plus, I felt like I was playing the game well, but got blown out of the water by the other two players. The reason? I didn't place a single Governor and they did (in spades). Given the very strong end game scoring component to Governors, they could be a bit overpowered. I'd have to play the game again and focus on placing more of them to find out. Regardless, this is something I want to play again for sure.

The basic gameplay is nicely designed. Playing the cards either for an instant action or future income creates interesting decisions round by round and rewards careful planning. The victory point system however, is a mess. There are, in fact, 21 places where you can score points: 6 different building tasks, 6 tiles related to walls building, 5 area majorities, 3 tile majorities plus various ways to score with action cards.  And all of these are open from turn one on. Some may like this as "multiple pathes to victory" but for me, this is simple an example of lazy game design where the authors just drown the game in a mess of scoring categories instead of focusing of fewer but clearer goals. Never again!

This is one of the rare times, where I can't assess a game easily. I liked it, but I'm not sure how much. Is there too much luck involved due to the cards? Is the small and indirect interaction enough? Is it enough to have multiple majority mechanisms in a game where points are everywhere? I've no clue yet, but I'm willing to play it a few more times to find out.

RATING: 9
Heavy rules, but only because there are so many moving pieces and different actions that are available. When it comes down to gameplay, you are really only focused on a few things every round. 

I can't help compare this to Terra Mystica. Multi-step process to get pieces out on the board, end of round bonuses, majority scoring and end game tasks laid out from the start. Now, the heart of this game is made up of tableau management and card play, however. What that forces you to do is think a number of steps ahead. Do you want to collect the most octagons to get the end of the round bonus (this or a future round), do you want to build up your engine in order to make some big moves in subsequent turns, are you trying for specific end game points, do you have to clear unrest, so many thing. 

Iconography was a bit inconsistent in places and it would have been nice for each player to have a cheatsheet (rather than just 1 place on the board) for what each action does (to build a palace, it's 2 workers from the area where you want to build + 1 worker from another area, a governor is 1 cube of each color, etc.). But after a few rounds we got it.

Not looking forward to teaching this again (even though it will definitely be easier) but I'm totally looking forward to playing it again.

This is just weird.  I think a lot of planning can happen when players understand the game well, but that's definitely going to take more plays!  There's an interesting trade-off when deciding which column to play cards in and whether to go for the majorities now or wait until the next round. It's one of those games that doesn't quite reveal itself to you in the first play. Hmmm. (1 play)

RATING: 8
Despite its simple card play mechanics, ZhanGuo is a brain burner.  Limited actions (30) mean you are stretched to achieve tasks, gain area control, and score wall points.  Definite AP potential as your tableau effects snowball late game.

RATING: 8.5
Need to play again to get a better feel of the game. Mixed reactions at the table; first and second turn were kinda messy, nobody knew what to do, the following were way smoother and more "logical". Definitely need further plays.

Upped to 8 after a few more plays. It gets smoother as it gets played.

Upped again, 8.5, after some more. It's good. Great, even. Give it a try (or three :))

RATING: 8.2
Actually it doesnt seem that brain burner. You must only concentrate on bonus actions of cards which you played on your board to use them properly and follow card numbers which is played on the court. Try to complete quests and place a governor if you are able for the end game scoring.

Beautiful design and choices where you may alternate strategies but court actions are illusional. You must only accomplish imperial quests, taking your bonus actions and fulfilling end turn's bonusses.

After 5 games decided it's not the game for me. It's not a bad game but there's other games with similar mechanics I'd rather play with 2 players, and I believe it would be too analysis paralysis with 4 players (especially if 2 are new to the game) so I can't be bothered to risk that.

It is basically a race game with tableau building. The beginning of the game you will probably focus on building your tableau whilst the race is on to get the bonus squares and sets built first. At the final half of the game your tableau is more or less built and then comes the boring bit of adding up the value of each action for each card, at this stage in a 2 player game there is little player interaction as the race is over and most cards will get between 10-15 points depending on which action you use it for.

I love the way you build up your own bonus engine based on which cards you slot into your player board. And all of the different ways to get points work together so well. Palaces get you extra cylinders toward the end of round bonuses and also big one time points, the governors get you one time bonuses while also contributing to area majority scoring, and the wall segments qualify you for end game scoring goals. And all this balances well with the big points you can get from mixing all three of these things, making for a really interesting dynamic.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (June 2015)

I was expecting a heavier game, however, I still liked it a lot because it has a satisfying depth.

The game components and art are quite good. The theme is rather thin, but I don’t really care for it (it is a bit boring for me), however the gameplay is really good.

ZhanGuo is a medium weight game for me. The decisions aren’t obvious, but they aren’t that hard either. I still think it offers lots of interesting decisions (where to play your card, in the game board or in your player board? If you played in the game board how it affects the next player? Which action to do? Can you take the bonus action?, if you played in the player board, in which region? Which color card to play?). You also have to strive to do some tasks because they give a lot of VPs (many ways to victory) and they are randomly chosen at the beginning of the game (increasing the replayability factor). 

ZhanGuo is one of those games in which you want to do much more than you actually can with your limited cards, I love it.

It has many rules, but they are easy. You can explain it under 25 minutes.

There is also a small amount of luck in the game, namely the number you get in your cards. It doesn’t bother me at all because you can mitigate it, also sometimes you want low numbers and sometimes you want high numbers. This luck only affects the bonus you can execute, you can always do your full action with ANY card. I love this.

I have liked every game I have played from What´s your game, they are one of my favorite game companies.

Bottom line, ZhanGuo is a good game that has a permanent spot in my game collection, it has a lot of moving pieces you need to grasp to really have a chance at winning, but it isn’t that hard (Madeira is a lot heavier). I want to play it again soon and it will probably get a higher rating from me with more plays.

Current Rating : 7.0

This would prob be closer to a 9 for me except that I think it's going to be very difficult to get to the table with more than 2p as there's a pretty steep learning curve and people tend to love or hate this game.  Found it unique and engaging (love the bonus action rules of playing a higher or lower value card).  No cons other than difficulty to teach/get to the table.

This is a fine game, quite clever, and nicely designed. However, this is NOT a 2 player game. It is far too easy for one player to run away with it. Due to the area scoring and bonuses.

I think this game would be great with 4, unfortunately, I don't think I'll ever get to play it with 4. 

With 2 players, it just doesn't work.

2017-10-22 - This one probably deserves a better rating than a 7.5, so I won't be surprised if it goes up over time. This is a fun and interesting engine building game.

Check out my solo (automa) rules: https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/158964/automa-solo-variant-rules

Once in a while, I contemplate moving ZhanGuo down in my ranking of board games, but whenever I play it, I am reminded of just how good it is and why I consider it my favorite game of all time. It is like a perfectly cooked medium-rare ribeye steak. So meaty and delicious to the last bite! 

ZhanGuo is awesome! There is a great tension between wanting to use your cards to build up your bonus abilities versus playing them to actually take actions. This game always leaves me wanting to play it more. I love the arc that results as your bonuses gradually increase throughout the game, and I love the battle over the unification markers and the tough choice to use them or hold them over to the next round.

Yet another play leads to more admiration for the design and tough choices of this game! There is something very satisfying about seeing your card bonuses build up and increase the strength of your actions over the course of the game. The B-side player boards are a cool addition as well; though not really necessary, I think I will always use them in future plays.

This game is simple; play a card into your tableau or use it on the board to pick one of six actions.  Yet, each card played sets you up for future combos.  Thinking about those combos can lock an AP prone person into the matrix.  Even without problems with AP, it took me quite awhile to get why and how best to play a card.  I think I was able to scratch the surface and I am confident it will take awhile and several plays before I feel comfortable understanding this game.  Wow this game is fun.

[b]Tableau building:[/b]
You can tuck cards under your board to get bonus follow-on actions when choosing certain actions. The synergies you build into your tableau shape your strategic goals for the game. Having bonuses for many different actions is good because you can be flexible, but no one action is amazing for you. Having lots of bonuses for one action makes doing that action amazing, but it also means you are highly dependent on getting the follow-on actions which isn't guaranteed.

This aspect of the game is the main feature. It's where all the interesting decisions and planning are focused. It's also how you can keep an eye on what your opponents are going to be doing. The cards they tuck are insight into their strategy.

[b]Completing goals:[/b]
There are many goals for you to work towards in the game. There are 6 wall sections you can build into and each one has a different scoring condition for the end of the game. There are 6 tasks that reward points for building walls in certain sections, building palaces in certain districts, and installing governors in certain regions. The first to complete a task is awarded more points than those that come afterwards. 

A lot of the strategic considerations are focused on completing these tasks as early as possible, while building the tableau you want, while setting yourself up for endgame points from the wall sections you plan on building, while taking advantage of opportunities to score points along the way. There is a lot to consider at once, honestly too much to properly understand in a first play.

I've found that there are many ways to get things done in this game. Things always play out differently and I'm always surprised at the different paths that exist.

RATING: 6
What's up with these southern European game designers and their baroque complex euro designs. Zhan Guo is another entry in the growing line of Vinhos, Madeira, Kanban etc. Only occasionally, non-mediterranean designers chime in with this trend, e.g. Bruxelles 1893. I can enjoy some of these titles but my problem with them is that I can't get rid of the nagging doubt that the complexity of the construction often only hides that there's not that much depth under the hood, that creativity is replaced with coping best with the system.

Zhan Guo is no exception to this. The basic simple decision of playing a card to your tableau or to your discard pile is complicated by a lot of different consequences of the various card types and a plethora of subsystems. There's area majority, engine building, definition of end game scoring conditions, fulfillment of 'orders', end of round benefits to compete for.

A strategic plan based on the emperor's demands should be formed in advance and supported by building a focused engine. Hopefully, the cards needed to do so show up. The discard part with the card numbers deciding whether the essential bonus actions kick in, feels improvised. The current voices indicate that the worker bonus might be a bit too strong. I'd be willing to give Zhan Guo more tries but wouldn't be too sad if these plays don't materialize.

Engine building, so many paths to victory, plays so different (but just as great) with each player count. I love not only the big picture of the game, but all the smaller parts too: the majority mechanism, where you can pay your tokens to take the bonus, or keep them for later; how these majorities determine turn order as well; how, if there are no tokens to take, you take a point, which sometimes is better, so time it well; how you can use cards to block your opponents' next move, because you have limited info on what they have.

Good game which I seem to like better the more I play it.  I like the card play mechanic and deciding how and when to use your cards to your best advantage.  There are enough options/strategies to make it interesting.  Player interaction is limited and relatively benign where it does exist.  Luck of the card draw, especially the initial one to start the game, will certainly have an impact on initial strategy and in some cases can have a lasting impact throughout the game.

The theme is simply an asthetic vehicle as this is a prime example of a pasted on theme.

A game with area majority and lots of other little rules, so many that I didn't think I was going to like it when it was explained to me, but during play it all fit together nicely and I enjoyed it. A heavy brain burner with a lot of downtime, and because you're not sure which card you can play until the person before you has played his card you can't really plan your turn, which is a big minus. Still a solid game, if somewhat convoluted, but that seems to be the current trend.

The card mechanic used here is interesting and offers something new to the gameplay which is otherwise mix of well-known mechanics and "feel". Scoring is a bit fiddly, but because you only have 30 turns to do things you should need to focus only on couple of scoring categories. The biggest issue here is the length of the game and the time what you need to spend teaching Zhanguo for the new players. It's not complicated game, but there are quite amount of small things to remember and that's why it takes some time to teach game.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS:

Really enjoyed my first play despite our poor choices half the time!  I tend to enjoy games in which cards form the basis of defining your actions and also potentially allow for additional actions/enhancements and this has it as a central mechanic.  It is a typical What's Your Game game in that there are a ton of pieces, mish-mash of mechanics, and many different ways to score points both in and end game (of which you should likely be fairly focused).

Another of the Essen hotnesses. I was suspicious of this one because I have not been liking recent Your Game releases (Madeira). I feel they have complexity cranked up for the sake of complexity, and people who enjoy solving complex problems just because. Lately I've been leaning towards simple games that have lots of depth that emerge from their small set of rules instead.

ZhanGuo wasn't as barroque as Madeira, and the basic mechanism was very interesting: Take all the cards for the round (a bit like Brass) and either use them to take an action, or to give yourself a permanent bonus whenever you take an action.

The thing that killed the game for me is the fifty different things you're trying to do in order to get points (majorities in this, and that, and the first one to do certain things here, and certain things there, etc, etc).

For this play, I decided to completely ignore the scoring and just focus on doing my actions really efficiently (mostly focusing on governors). I ended up winning the game by a few points, which left me even less satisfied (although it's true that we were all new to the game).

Zhangou is not a well known game but is surprising.  It is played over 5 rounds and you can use cards for future benefits or to take actions.  You only get benefits though if your card number is higher or lower than the previous card played.  You need to collect administrators to get workers that build the Great Wall, Palaces, or put out governors.  When placing cards you get benefits if you turn in different colors.  Palaces can give you one time benefits as well. There is unrest that occurs as you put more cards on the same location.  

There is a lot to this game and it is a bit hard to teach.  But the payoff is very high.  I like this game a lot it is an excellent game.

I just love the fairly simple rules set and the crunchy, thinky, "arrrgghh I wish I'd done that instead" you get from gameplay. What's Your Game are on a roll at the moment and can do little wrong in my eyes.

A lovely game that I want to play loads more albeit strategically, tactically completely differently next time 

UPDATE

Absolutely love this game and am absolutely awful at it. I mean really bad. Does anyone have any strategic tips they could pass on to a no hoper?

Love the gameplay though, so simple in what you can do (play a card either to your region board or to the main action space) yet it ripples out a web of complexity that I really enjoy and so do the other players as they will inevitably wonder past and far beyond me on the scoring track!

I'm looking forward to getting Madiera later on in the year and for the new game Brasil which I hope may have a similar ease of card play.

I sort of feel like I have been baited by theme a little bit? It is really a completely abstract game with a neat card play: Play on your tableau for engine-building or play on the board for more concrete actions and engine-triggering? But after that, it is just area majority scoring and a race scoring depending on the characteristics of your engine or the area you built in. It is not my type of game but you like a no-nonsense engine-building + area control + point salads, definitely try it.

Mechanically sound game that works well, but comes with an overly (and needlessly) complicated/complex system that really causes a divide for the players between the theme and the actual gameplay. Because of that, disappointing.

Very interesting and unique card play is the key feature of this game. There certainly are many ways to score points, but they all make sense and provide multiple paths to victory. Although it's fine with 2, I can see where three of four players ups the tension.

ZhangGuo is like a maze of scoring opportunities.  You negotiate that maze by playing cards for actions or by playing cards to build up your tableau.  The rules are streamlined and elegant, but the game-play is deep and multifaceted.  This is a game of freedom & possibilities, not one of scarcity and restriction.  In fact, the game is more one of logistics than of economics.   I like the game, but it's a hard sell - it's getting a 'meh' reaction from most everyone to whom I've introduced it.

Thank goodness for Radho Runs Through or I would have written this game off. The other coverage I've seen of this game did nothing to make me take notice of it, in fact it was a turn-off to the game. However, Richard Ham has worked his magic again. I love the complexity of this game in terms of the interweaving synergies and long-range planning while the game itself is very easy to learn with simple actions. While not especially thematic the bits and artwork are very nice.

Great game design that I thoroughly enjoyed. Heavy game but picks up easily within a few turns. 

PROS
-Variable score conditions each game (high replay value)
-Card combo engine building
-Buddha area control
-Five province
-Multiple resources to manage (province dependent) 
-Worker unrest. 
-theme is light but done well (Buddha reduces worker unrest)

CONS
-The mini game of playing high or low card to active card engines introduces some luck (the numbers you get are random). Also adds frustration as your long term planning can be harmed if you can't activate your engine. 
-Board layout could be improved. Visually confusing, especially the walls, we completely missed one during he first game! Same with the provinces, should be colour shaded and/ or more ordered.

Even if the rules are not difficult, it could be hard to play because there are so many interrelated ways to collect VP. One can think for a very long time if searching the optimum path. Fortunately in a finite normal time it is virtually impossible to calculate everything (which would make the game more puzzle-like and less interesting for me), and one has to count on broader strategic choices.

What I like a bit less is that some tactical moves are still too important and that the luck of the draw may have some weight. 

What I dislike is the mechanic of the card numbers (one has to compare the number of the played card with the number of the previously played card to see if they get the bonus): fortunately this mechanic has a much lower impact than I was expecting after reading the rules (but it is still the only thing of this game that I actively dislike). 

What I like most is the interaction, to arrive first to get something or the area control fights with the governors and so on. It is really tense and interesting, especially  with 4 players.

RATING: 8
A not-simple point salad game that does Feld proud. You've got your hand of cards, each of which may be partially tucked under your player board (La Isla) to engine-build  or instead played for one of X (Bruges) seemingly-orthogonal-but-actually-related actions (uh, the entire Feld oeuvre), one of which may reap engine-related benefits if taken under the proper circumstances (AquaSphere, Trajan). Throw in some punishment (Amerigo, Notre Dame, Macao), some methods to remediate that punishment (Notre Dame, Bruges), a cascade of end-game bonuses for having accomplished various things (Bora Bora), and a hearty dose of luck of the draw (La Isla, Bruges) and you have a Feld. Only, it's not actually a Feld.

RATING: 7.5
It's a medium to heavy strategic euro with many paths to victory. The interaction level -always indirect interaction- is quite high. The theme is 95% artificial.

The rules are elegant: once explained, you almost have no need to come back to the rulebook. But in many cases, (not all) it is very difficult to see how many points your actions will generate.

The graphic design is simple but beautiful and the components are nice. The games are longer than advertised, but you get to do a lot of things and I have not seen AP while playing it (except, maybe, during the last turns).

IMO, its main issue is that it lacks a differentiating factor (some people could say it's a "souless euro" :p) and I think this is the reason its replayability will resent. Another thing I don't like is that the cards (especially in the first turns) will dictate your global strategy. And once you place your bet on a specific strategy, the luck with the future cards will also constitute a meaningful factor.

The scoring system is way too complicated but there is a lot of stuff done right to compensate for that. There are constantly quite a few timing issues to consider regarding both your own engine and the board actions of others. You don't have enough actions to do all the stuff you'd want, and then there's the juggling for round end influence bonuses as well. Still, player turns are very quick except for near the very end of the game, when turns degenerate into calculating for optimal moves.

RATING: 8
Bellissimo gioco dalla profondità notevole ma molto lineare visto che gira intorno a due semplici operatività, giocare carte nella propria mano sulla (sotto) propria plancia o giocarle sul tabellone. Il gioco necessita di una programmazione a lungo termine dove bisogna portare particolare attenzione ai bonus di fine partita. Gioco profondo e molto ben pensato. Ho il sospetto che con l'aumentare del numero di partite le aperture possano uniformarsi ed inoltre ho la paura che con giocatori molto pensierosi i tempi di attesa possano crescere notevolmente viste le diverse scelte disponibili. Gioco che nasconde una forte interazione benché ogni giocatore giochi principalmente sulla propria plancia. Decisamente promosso.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8 -> 8)[/COLOR]

[i]I am really happy that I continued to play ZhanGuo throughout the year. Not only does my son like it, but my older daughter is now a fan. The game scales well, I've played with two, three and four players. The decisions in this game continue to remain engaging and different from play to play because of the variety of cards and abilities in each deck. I summed up my thoughts on the game play perfectly a year ago; I just want to reiterate that ZhanGuo definitely has stood the test of time and will continue to get played. I've recently played the designers' newest game, Railroad Revolution, which is another solid design but I still prefer ZhanGuo. The card play in ZhanGuo is a stand out mechanism that presents a great puzzle to solve each game. I'd highly recommend taking a break from all the new games coming out and check out ZhanGuo, I can't imagine that you'd be disappointed.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- I like the setting for the game even if the theme doesn't shine through. Everything is function first, but the game looks great on the table especially at the end.
- Ease of game play, for a game with a lot of different things going on the rules are extremely clear and the game plays out smoothly. You can tell this game has been play tested a lot.
- Card play with a twist, cards can be built in your tableau to trigger abilities when activated for certain tasks or be used to activate those tasks. However; you need to play a higher/lower number than the current card if you want to trigger those bonuses for the action you're taking.
- Plays great with 2 and once you know the rules this game plays fast considering how heavy it is (I'd consider it a medium to medium heavy weight game).

ZhanGuo really surprised me, I only bought it because it was on sale and was pleasantly surprised at how much fun it was. On top of that my son really enjoyed it and is already seeking a rematch. I've been avoiding adding too many of this weight of games into my collection since they see much less play, but ZhanGuo plays so fast and the rules are so clean that I think it'll see a fair number of plays this year. This makes me more interested in trying out some of the other What's Your Game games.[/i]

Far too convoluted a rule set and scoring system for what really wants to be a simple game. Considering the massive luck of the draw in the cards and how well they work together for you, and considering that a key element of the game relies on you being able to play cards whose value is higher/lower than the one another player just did, the randomness level is too high to do anything more than just play quickly and see what happens. 

I would rather have that in a 45 minute game instead of one twice that length.

Very solid game. It felt like 'more of the same' though, although the way the cards are used as bonus and action triggers is interesting. There are almost too many ways of scoring points, making it hard to get a feel for who is winning.

Well, I had a lot to say about this game when we first got it. Paulo and I always playtest new games for two players before we start taking it to others. I was underwhelmed. And with subsequent plays, my initial problem with the game still stand. However, the game isn't as bad as I first thought. My main critique of the game is that the cards (and therefore, my actions) have too much utility or versatility with no direction or goal in mind. I imagine that the attraction for a game like this is that you start with nothing and end up with an amazing victory point scoring engine, but that doesn't really kick in until the fourth round or so. The game isn't very thematic or exciting really and there's very little given over to luck or randomness. I wouldn't know how to fix a game like this either. All I know is that I wasn't having fun; I wanted to accomplish my tiny objectives and see how many points I got at game's end, but there was no moment of excitement or tension. Zhang Guo is the epitome of the Euro that everyone hates: "stay in your lane." Your moves won't impact others and their moves won't impact your strategy. There is no interaction between players and no reason to pay attention to their actions. The game isn't the worst I've played but it's not one that I'd show to new gamers to get them to enter the wondrous world of games.

Since this was a EuropeMasters game 2015 one gets fed up of it after the tournament (and all practising before), and as usual with EuropeMasters games I quit playing this afterwards. But that doesn't mean its a bad game. I like the dual use of the cards and the hi/low number function for gaining bonuses, you really need to plan how to play your cards to get the bonuses each time. The dual use of cards is to me very similar to Deus, which also was an EuropeMasters game that year. 

I have played the game a few times after EM and still like it, but I still feel done with it.

ZhanGuo is a game that’s essentially about cardplay. Each turn, you have a hand of six cards, and you must decide to either tuck them under your player board in order to get bonuses later, or play them to do one of six actions, which include gathering resources (which oddly come in the form of “officials” and “workers” in this game), and building walls, palaces, and governors using those resources. The player board is split into six regions, which represent the six regions of the game board, and the position of the resources on the player board determines where the piece is placed on the game board. There are a lot of ways to score points at the end of the game, including bonuses for building walls/palaces/governors in certain regions, area majority for governors, and multipliers for a variety of things in the wall spots. I didn’t dislike this game, but the various mechanics didn’t come together very well for me. I found it a little difficult to articulate a coherent strategy.

I need to play this again as the first time I was just trying to wrap my head around what the fuck I was doing. It was hard to understand the rules, but piecing it all together to make a coherent strategy was another thing. I had a hell of a time explaining the rules the first time as I tried to do it in action order instead of an understandable order. Trying to explain walls before workers didn't make much sense.

A lot of balls to juggle in this one, but seemed enjoyable enough on the first play.

Loved my first play. I love games with multiple use cards, so I was inclined to like this, but I was surprised by how much I did.  I preferred it to WYG darling Madeira (although the two have little in common). In the game you draw a new hand of 6 cards on each of 5 rounds. On your turn you play one card, either to your personal board or for one of six actions. These actions let you recruit managers, move them around regions, use your managers to recruit workers and install governors, or use workers to build palaces or part of the great wall.  These objects will score you points in various ways (both immediate and end game scoring). It is a bit point salady, but nowhere near Feld level, primarily because the pieces interconnect in a more interesting way than I find most Feld games to do.  It is just a bit on the heavy side of medium, which is my ideal weight (think Shipyard, Agricola, Le Havre).

Well, they certainly know how to make a good strategic game at WYG?, that's for sure! Only 1 play with 2 players, from whom I didn't expected too much, as it has majorities in it upto a certain level, but it plays in fact excellent with 2.

Typical game where you have to optimize your moves to a maximum and you won't be able to do all the stuff you want. I like this kind of games :-)

RATING: 8
Cool, intricate game that feels like it's almost bursting/falling apart at the seams, but wonderfully manages to hold itself together. It's a resource-management cube-pushing point salad, with just enough player interaction to keep the competition interesting. There's a little too much going on, but you can pick sub-goals to prevent the worst of AP, and the little moves fit into the big picture just right.

At the core of the game are cards. You can place them in front of you for a small bonus, or throw them away for an action. When you perform an action, you might trigger a subset of the cards you played in front of you, and get bonus actions. Since gaining points requires a lot of small steps (getting cubes, then moving them, then converting them to hammers, then moving those hammers, ...), ideally you'll have placed plenty of cards with relevant bonus actions, so that performing an action leads to a lot of those little steps being completed.

Actual points come from area majority, racing to complete goals, end-game scoring for cubes/cards, points for cards during the game and bonus actions. Placing cards will give bonus stuff during the game, but also give unrest cubes that you need to remove... there's a lot riding on every little decision, timing matters, and the cards your opponents play matter too.

If you like games where you have to plan out mini-actions, work on an engine that will eventually lead to many points, and where you want to be faster than your opponents, ZhanGuo is very much recommended.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
In this game, you play 5 rounds and each round you get a hand of 6 cards. On your turn, you either tuck one of the cards, which might enhance future actions if the number on the card you play meets the criteria, or you play the card to the board, and do a thing. You compete with other players for board positions for being firsties for achievements. 

The game is fairly complicated, and your strategy needs to line up between the cards you happened to draw each round and the available achievement tiles and wall bonus tiles. The significant decision point in the game is when to stop tucking and when to start acting.

Players can unwittingly block you because of the number printed on the card they last played. Some actions require a card lower than the previous played card, and some want one higher, in order to get to use the bonus effects you spent so much time constructing. This blindly blocking other player's plays seems underdeveloped as does the "corruption" marker mechanic, which can sometimes cause minor trouble for you when you want to add new cards to your board, but otherwise doesn't come into play much. 

For a game this complicated, I wish it had a little more flexibility, as when I play it I don't feel I have many meaningful choices to make. I just do my best to get the achievements done as fast as I can, and I hope other players don't happen to get in my way.

(+) Smooth and elegant gameplay, little to no downtime.

(+) Rather quick to explain and play, yet very interesting mechanics and meaningful decisions offered to players. Easy to teach, hard to master.

(+) Little luck dependence.

(+) Some potential for engine building.

(-) This game is very mechanical and not thematic at all. There is some background story of unifying China, but it doesn't shine through in the mechanics at all.

(-) Why are the octacon blocks limited? I feel this creates some silly situations during the game. Sure, one player can hoard them denying all other players those blocks, but this factors out an important mechanic of the game.

(-) The back of the cards should have made it more clear which 'kind' of card your opponents are still holding.

(-) Near the end of the game, the game becomes too much of a point salad: it takes a lot of counting (and guessing what others after you will do) in order to figure out where best to spend your final actions on, only to score marginally different points.

(-) I don't very much like the 'winner takes it all' principle in the area majority scorings of the gouvernors in the different regions at the end of the game. There is potential for too significant point swings here in my opinion

[u]Tips:[/u]
(*) It probably is good practice to start off with unification actions (shoving cards under your tableau) in order to score unification bonusses at the end of the first round and to start up your engine.
(*) Look at the Emeror's requests in order to get a good lead for a suitable strategy to follow
(*) Area majority scorings for emperors are important point generators, just like constructing palaces at a time when you allready have a lot of unification cards under your tableau. Good wall-actions can also score you about 20 points. If you combine these mechanisms with the emperors requests, you are likely to perform very well.

What a terrible mess this game is, too many things crammed into a design does not make it shine. Madeira was borderline enjoyable, but this one does not even register on the 'fun' scale, and don't get me started on the gimmicky 'play card higher/lower' to trigger cards in my tableau!

... I think I'm done with WYG, their definition of a good game simply does not match my criteria. Just give me old school classics ala Knizia or Kramer anyday over this non-sense.

The sum is clearly more than its parts. A card-engine-builder at heart, this one carries the theme very well. Although there's quite a bit of interaction, this is one of the most positive heavy games I know. You can almost always execute you plans, there's always something good to do. This is a 'fun' brain burner.

01/09: Played it for the first time and I had fun, it's a beautiful looking game and a great puzzle, however I found the core mechanisms somewhat counter-intuitive and the vast array of options can be a bit overwhelming at first. 

Played a second game after I realized that we had played a major rule the wrong way, much cleaner the second time around. I'll keep it.

Had my fun, no need to own it anymore. Sold

This is a great point-salad style euro-game. Unlike many other point-salad style games, ZhanGuo has a fairly well-integrated and interesting theme that pushes it a notch or two above its rivals. Mechanically it is mainly an action-selection game with a bit of engine-building thrown in for good measure.

Though the game can look a bit intimidating at first, once you start playing a round or two it quickly reveals itself as lighter fare than some other titles from game publisher What's Your Game (for example Vinhos, Asgard and Madeira. It is probably closer to Vasco Da Gama in terms of complexity). Having said that, the decision space during your turn is still sizeable and AP prone players can slow things down quite a bit.

Didn't enjoy this at all I'm sorry to say, because I usually like this publisher. Didn't get my head around the theme, and so felt that for almost the entire game I was randomly doing stuff and was neither able to internalise the rules, nor make sense of what was happening, nor yet imagine what a coherent strategy might look like. I was utterly shocked therefore to find out that I won the game. I'm sure there's probably a reasonable game in there somewhere but I didn't find it and am  unlikely to give this one a second chance. Too much point salad, and the sheer irritation of having to move those cubes around! So irritating I hardly took any cubes - I don't know if that's what won the game for me. I note that it's highly rated, so it's doubtless a good game - so my view is simply a matter of taste

RATING: 6
Played twice. I'll start by stating that ZhanGuo is a solid medium-heavy design. The central card mechanism which allows a chain reaction to be triggered when a particular action is taken is simple, yet very effective. There is a minor niggle concerning the luck involved in the activation numbers of cards, but that can be mitigated by having backup plans available if the numbers suddenly change to something unfavourable.

What dampens my enthusiasm is that the chain of actions to get points is a bit convoluted for my tastes – I first have to recruit officials, whom I need to move around to get workers. I [i]then[/i] need to spread these workers around before I get to build palaces or walls. Granted, players have to take advantage of the bonus chain reactions to speed this process up, but I often felt that the game was forcing me to jump through one too many hoops to accomplish something.

Secondly, there were complaints from my table that the game was too abstract. I'm fine if the designer is upfront about the theme not mattering, but the designers clearly made an effort in this case to incorporate some theme. However, the theme is not applied consistently enough and ends up not shining through the gameplay.

That said, I still do admire however everything falls into place in the overall design and found myself musing about it for some time. This just seems to be a mismatch between the designers' intent and the actual gameplay – complexity for the sake of being complex, and abstraction when there is a great underlying theme involved.

It does have some danger of brain-grinding micro-optimization, and it took us around 3 out of 5 rounds to really get into the game. Once you have wound your brain around the confusing fact that indeed nothing on the card (except for the number) matters when you go to the palace, it seems like a pretty nice game, though. Not sure I would buy it, but I will happily give it another try if I see it somewhere.

This game is on the heavy and involved side, and for that, I really do enjoy it. There are numerous elements that are interrelated, and so each action somehow impacts the next. The most unique aspect of this one is how you play a card and if that card is higher (or lower, depending upon the action), you are able to use the advantage of the bonus of the cards that you have played in your tableau. I love the chaining of how the cards that you have previously played give you those bonuses, and I also like the race element with the king's objectives to build tension and provide clear goals for you to achieve.

RATING: 8
This is a card-driven action-selection game based on the unification of China.  Each player is taking on different tasks to unify writing, currency, and laws in China while fulfilling goals of the emperor all to get sweet, sweet points.

I played this very close to my first play of the Staufer Dynasty and they have one thing in common.  They are both incredibly simple games in terms of what you do on your turn but with cascading effects that make each of those simple decisions incredibly deep and complex.

Like Staufer Dynasty each player has only two option on their turn.  Either play a card to your tableau or play a card to the central area for an effect.  Playing a card to your tableau grants you a bonus whenever one of the 6 actions is taken.  You have 5 areas that can each hold 3 of these advisers for a total of 15 possible bonuses.  However the more advisers you put in an area, the angrier the populace will get and unrest will rise.  If it gets too high you won't be able to benefit form the advisers in that area.

If you play a card to the central area you take one of the 6 different actions.  Each action itself provides a different bonus, most of them score points or set you up to score points in different areas.  However, there is a pretty neat mechanism in place here where you only get the bonuses of your advisers if you play a card, which are numbered from 1-120, that is higher or lower than the previously played card depending on the action being taken.  This not only requires you to set up your actions so they are most efficient but also pay attention to your opponents so that they can't hinder you (or so you can hinder them!)

Past the really clever card play this is a typical optimization game.  There are several ways to get points.  There are bonuses for goals the emperor puts forth, sections of the Great Wall to be built, where you install governors, etc.  There are so many actions per turn players will most likely do a little bit of everything and it becomes kind of a race to be first in different areas since being first scores more points.

The components are fine.  The governors are little people, the wall sections look like walls, and the temples like temples.  Everything else is pretty much just colored disks but nothing feels or looks cheap.  Because of the number of actions this is a reasonably long game and with so many different areas to score it is also not the most accessible although I think once players understand that there shouldn't be too much referencing the book or confusion because the basic mechanics are actually super simple.

I really enjoy the game, it is a deep and engaging experience and I love the incorporation of inter-player play, racing for specific accomplishments, and large decision trees.

I found this game both interesting and a bit disappointing.  It's a lot of fun, and it has interesting decisions throughout the game. On the other hand, it's kind of overwrought and heavy, and it might just be too long to get out on a regular basis.  I'd much rather play one of my favorite Feld or Rosenberg games if I'm going to break out something long and heavy.  Unfortunately, 'good' is probably not good enough to keep at this game weight.

It's kind of an engine builder, and I think I may just prefer engine builders that are shorter.  Most of the long games I really like probably wouldn't be considered engine builders.  This kind of falls in line with Russian Railroads for me.

The below probably reflects my mental state as much as the game.

A Euro for Eurogamers
Beautiful art and components. Should be well recieved by the audience it is aimed at. But... if it wasn't so earnest I would have thought this was a parody of eurogames. 
Build an engine, move cubes, balance short, long term, specialization and generalization goals as well as the multitude of bonuses that had to be shoehorned into the spreadsheet for balance. The mechanisms do nothing to make the game more interesting.
I already have a couple euros on my shelf and this does nothing to usurp those.

RATING: 7.5
[company=4303][/company] has done it again. It seems they can do no wrong!... oh wait, [thing=123219]they can*[/thing]
Anyhow... This game is quite meaty indeed. It doesn't look that way from looking at the components or the board though. The board especially is not very busy at all, with just a few obvious wall sections and very muted icons.
The way in which you can use cards in 2 different ways isn't new but works great and does offer some nice painful choices. The mechanism of gaining bonuses when performing actions with cards also makes your timing a thing to factor in.
This is one of those games where you can do only a fraction of what you want to do, so there's plenty of interesting choices to be made on multiple levels. The possibilities are quite big. This might introduce some very bad AP in some groups, something you should be aware of if your group is prone to that.
I must say that I quite enjoyed the puzzle this game offers and I look forward to exploring it more. I don't think it's the best of the series so far, but it is certainly worthy of being part of this product line.

BGG scale: 7/10

* There's nothing wrong with OddVille, but in stead of a good to great heavy euro, it's an OK family strategy game.

It's been a while since I've labeled a game as a brain-burner, but ZhanGuo qualifies. And oddly enough, it's a brain-burner despite very, very simple mechanics. Each turn, you either play a card to your personal tableau or discard a card and select one of six possible actions. Sounds easy, right? Hardly. You get 30 actions during the game (via the card play), but each must be very efficient (by setting up your tableau well to execute your plan) and conform with your strategy (which you really need to have in place right from the start of the game).  In addition to that, timing of when you take actions (and the corresponding bonus actions from symbols in your tableau) can be critical. The game has tons to think about even if you simply play it tactically, doing what you can when you can, but a winning strategy involves playing the game from the outside in, so to speak ... you need to have your eye on the many end-game bonuses available early on and work relentlessly toward achieving the ones you want or risk accomplishing almost nothing. The game is incredibly deep and at times even elegant, but also bone dry and perhaps overly complex. Will need several more plays to see where my rating finally shakes out.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Not bad, but this is of the "it's hard to do anything" variety of euro games. You've got to plan ahead and really work to accomplish anything, and early errors can have a real impact. I tend to prefer games that are a little more clear and the strategy is easier to comprehend, but this is a well-designed game.

RATING: 9.5
I had a rough time wrapping my head around what I was even shooting for in the first few rounds. But once I started seeing how to get things on the board, and had some clear goals to shoot for, I had a tremendous time puzzling things out. There was just enough player interaction to create some tension, and I think it would grow with experienced players. The end-game was very satisfying. There are a ton of points to be tallied up. Our score discs were doing some serious leapfrogging. And as long as players are competent, they're going to have a moment or two where their discs jump crazy numbers. Win or lose, it's fun. I liked it. I'm very happy we got it played and I'd play it again anytime.'

::UPDATE::

This has climbed to be one of my favorite games. I can't wait to keep exploring. The only niggle I can see with it at this point is variety. I'd like to see some additional scoring tiles brought out by an expansion, or mini expansion. I know one exists already and I'm tracking it down.

I highly recommend this for people who want (1) a heavy, brain-burning game, and (2) a tableau-builder that pushes the limits of planning and efficiency crunching.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.75
My brain! I really don't like the term "point salad" but this is a heavy point salad - this is like the California Cobb of games or something.

You are often forced to make a judgment call about the value of a given card in your hand, not only in terms of its numerical value (which can activate bonuses after your "main action") but also its long-term viability as a permanent fixture in your little tableau-China-land-thing.  

I'll admit there were some parts of this game I neglected, such as the cube/worker management, which looked to be an important part of switching one's engine into 'snowball mode.'

hanguo (John Gwo) is a game that will hit you over the head when you first sit down to the table.  There's a lot going on and it's hard to parse at first.  Once you learn the game it's actually not that bad, but it'll take you a play to get there.

The game revolves around the cards.  There are three decks, which are split according to the card numbers, 1 - 40, 41 - 80, 81 - 120.  In addition to having a number the cards have potential bonuses, in the form of "When you take x action, get y." Every round you get 2 cards from each deck, so you'll get to play 6 cards in a round.

On your turn, you either play a card to your personal board, which means that later on you potentially get the "Do x, get y" bonus, or you play a card to the palace which means you chose to do one of 6 possible actions (the aforementioned x's).  

Two of the actions are getting workers and officials, which you need to do the other four actions... moving officials, building walls, building palaces, and building governors.  

Walls give you endgame points if you meet the appropriate conditions.  Palaces give you points for cards on your personal board.  And governors are used in area majority contests.  Additionally, there will be random goals in each game, along the lines of "Have a governor in regions 1, 4 and 5" or "Build palaces in region 2 and 3".  Whoever finishes the goals first gets the most points for doing that goal.  And if you complete multiple goals in the same area there's a multiplier effect.  So accomplishing two green goals doubles the score of your green goals, and accomplishing three (the most there are) triples them.

Oh, and those cards you played to your personal board, that potentially give you bonuses... they only do so if the card you use to play the action is the right number.  Some actions want the card to be a higher number and some want the card to be a lower number.

Additionally, when you play cards to your personal board you get some tokens of the card color, and there's a majority contest with those, as whoever has the most can spend all the tokens of one color that they have to get a bonus.  Those bonuses get better each round.  But if they choose not to, then the player with next most tokens can choose to spend their tokens to get the bonus.

So yeah, there's a lot to think about, and at first glance you just don't even know.  But by the end of the first game I was really started to see how things fit together and getting excited about the game.  There's some meat to sink your teeth into with this one.

Requires a fair bit of thinking between moves. However, that can mostly be done whilst the other players are making their moves. A longish game that does not feel especially long.

This game hits some kind of sweet spot for me. It has a lot of things to keep in mind, but at heart it isn't that complex. Thanks to getting only six cards at a time, you can't plan every detail and because you have to use all your cards you have to kind of go with the flow. This does not result in any considerable luck factor though, beucase of the two ways you can use the cards. The game ends at the right time, you get to do everything you want, but only if you're efficient. Just a really great heavy euro flow experience altogether.

This comment comes after my first game and a lousy explanation.
ZhanGuo is too complicated. It tries to create interesting decisions not with an interesting situation but with an excess of details and intricacies. It's like a pizza with too many tastes all togheter. It's a complicated point salad where it is too difficult to read the current situation: you can't have a good idea of who is in the lead and how good you are faring.
On the other hand, there are a couple of nice mechanics, especially the construction of an "engine" built on "bonus actions", that is particularly noteworthy. After a lenghty explanation it flows quite well, the duration is long but not excessive.
Art is nice in the personal board, not so much in the cards with useless illustrations.
Components are of just OK quality but the use of red both for a player and for one of the dignitaries that everyone uses could have been avoided. The little personal boards seem a bit to thin since they have to be build everytime like a jigsaw puzzle and they risk to  be ruined at the borders.

A historical reenactment of the efforts of Ying Zheng, the first Emperor of China, to unify its warring states. We are his personal emissaries trying to gain highest favor by advancing his agenda to instill a common written language, set of laws, and currency. Player boards of your regions are used to build the great wall for protection from the north barbarians, to build infrastructure, lavish palaces, install governors, and assemble his Terracota army. Many paths to score. Random compounded end game scoring goals. The trick of the game is to trigger bonuses with play of your officials and judicial, well-timed play of your six multi-use cards and hand management ala worker card placement. Watch out for unrest and creating revolt. A little dry and too heavy and mathy for my crew.

Me gusta mucho como funcionan todas las mecánicas, el uso de las cartas (debe ser superior o inferior a la anterior para combar) cumplir los 3 tipos de objetivos para multiplicar los puntos, buscar la mayoría en los territorios para rascar 9 puntos más...

Simplemente genial y no tan tan duro como me lo esperaba.

This is a very good game. When I played it at Essen I was very tired, and I didn't fully understand how deep the mechanics are. Very vry good. A must have.

Medium/Heavy Abstract game where you are trying to unify China; although the theme isn't relevant. Generally you can build sections of the wall of China, Palace or install governor, recruit workers.

Its a tableau builder game.  You have 2 options; put a card in tableau or into the court.  Putting it in tableau will give you initial unification bonus; however the real reason you do it is because the card itself will give you a potential bonus. 

When playing to the court (main board) it pays off a specific reward but also all your tableau bonuses also pay off.

Players will be trying to mitigate unrest, recruit workers and construct items already mentioned.

Played 3 times and I really like it. But the replayability seems quite low once you've done all iterations of all the potential bonuses but I certainly like it.

The game can be quite dry and abstract.  The abstract nature put off a lot of players I've played with in London and elsewhere; hence traded away due to its abstractness.

Lots going on in this game.  Many different strategies and ways to score.  Tight resources, but not too tight.

pretty meaty, nice components, awfull lot of choices to be made, downtime can be a issue and I also didn't like the "race for the 3 colors". Can easily become a 8 or 8.5 after further plays.
after 2nd play: very mechanical, score of 7.5 intact

RATING: N/A
This was given to us by friends, and it's great.  The gameplay functions a little better with some revised house rules, but it's a fun little Lego-based dungeon crawl.  I haven't commented on any of the other Heroica sets, because we always play will all four at once.

Very light Lego RPG. I thought this was going to be better than it was. Moving one pip each turn gets annoying. Also the extra weapons seem pointless. I guess playing with more in depth house rules would make it better.

RATING: 5
So much potential but failed by it's very basic rules - more a roll-and-move than an RPG. I really wanted this to be something more - I bought most of the sets and are still trying to work out some better rules, but with my limited RPG experience this requires quite a bit of research. It really should have had an actual rulebook (like the Ideas and Architecture manuals), not a silly little leaflet written in five languages.

The poor out-of-the-box experience was a fundamental problem with the entire Lego Games series and a cause of it's demise - you got a bunch of great components but was supposed to make up/refine the rules yourself. It seems like Lego grossly underestimated the effort needed to come up with a good set of rules and playtest/balance them, and essentially delivered half a product. 

I'm willing to give this a 5 for the concept, figures and nice microscale build, but pretty much 0 for the rules (non-existent rather than just broken). Hopefully this returns in an improved form someday.

very hard game to rate. 

objectively the rules are too simple, the maps too simple, there's no reward for pushing the game forward and not waiting for others to do the work for you...

but a) it's lego and b) it's a game for kids. it's VERY easy to tweak to add some depth, the overlord variant does some as well, and it's simply fun enough to play with my son. as a chutes&ladders alternative it's great...

RATING: 6.5
This fantasy series of games from Lego are a fantastic introduction into the dungeon crawling genre for younger players. All the elements of more complex dungeon romps are there, but streamlined to their foundation to make gameplay fast and easy. Building the game adds another element of fun, and I would recommend these games to anyone wishing to bring their children into the hobby. [b]Fortaan[/b] is the biggest of the sets in this collection and a must-have for fans of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
This is a definite game for children, which isn't a bad thing but the rules are SUPER simple and really not extremely exciting. 

Basically, roll a sword the enemy is captured, roll a skull and you take a hit, first one to the end wins.

The game feels like it should be a cooperative game, or even a player vs dungeon master. Don't let simple rules get you down though, it is Lego after all and that should mean if you don't like it (or maybe even if you do) get creative and make your own game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Only a 6 if you incorporate house rules.  Make battles more interesting (roll 2 six sided dice, one for hero, one for monster - high roller wins).  If you have bought a weapon, then you get to add +1 or something to your roll.  Be creative.  Also, give monsters more hit points based on their "rank" in rule book.  Great for kids.

A great game for the right audience. My two children (seven and four years old) loved the first session, and we played the three maps published with the game end-to-end. My seven year old then promptly went on to design his own dungeon, and we played our way through that!

Sadly, a couple of the other LEGO games that we had previously bought (Minotaurus and Ramses pyramid) fell a bit flat, either through lack of interest or unclear rules, but this one appears to be a winner. And the best part is: it's LEGO, so it's infinitely expandable.

RATING: 6
Is really fun the first time around, despite its very simplistic game engine. I find the novelty wears off quick however and I find myself either wanting to play a deeper board game or just simply play with legos, rather than a compromise of both activities which this game reduced to. This may be a great way to introduce your child to board games however, especially if they are into lego. I wouldn't dismiss this game entirely.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Lego Heroica is a good way to bring young children near to the fantasy-themed games and, more likely, to the ever-satisfying dungeon crawls: as for most Lego Games, they offer a simple but enjoyable basic gamesystem that can be easily changed, expanded and customized to appeal even grown-ups.

Being the biggest game in the series so far, Castle Fortaan’s main merit is exactly in its size, since it can be easily arranged into many different setups, which makes for many replays, even more if it’s combined with one or more of the other sets: as for the other Heroica games, it needs a heavy rewriting of all the rules as well for it to be somehow enjoyed by veteran gamers.

This set’s own hero, the paladin, is a good all-round character: not one of my favourites though.

So glad I bought all the Lego Heroica sets while they were still available. My son is finally old enough to play by the rules instead of just playing with the pieces. Even though it's roll and move, it's great fun. And the best part is that you can link all the sets together and play a campaign, carrying loot you've collected from set to set. It's the one kids game I own where you can dungeon crawl and fight monsters. And he LOVES that. Why aren't their more kids games like this?

Kids love it because it's Legos. Often times I end up combining all the sets I have and run a custom game (I through some D&D elements in to spruce it up). These games don't get played too often as they are rather lengthy to set up and the games go by rather quickly.

The games can be played online at their website if you want a tutorial and/or get a feel for the games. 

If you're into Lego's and have a few setting around, I'd recommend adding your stuff to make the game more enjoyable (if you like building).

(2011-10-15) Wow.  Just Way Cool!  My son, 11, is all over this.  The combination of visual and tactile appeal to somebody into Legos combined with a decent set of dungeon crawl rules makes this a good bet for mixed kids and kid-at-heart adults (like me).  We bought all four boxed sets.  My son and I immediately added a few house rules to make the monsters more interesting to fight.

Overall we are happy with Heroica. It delivered a lot of things we like, if not all the things we hoped it would. It is not a replacement for our favorite dungeon crawl games. It is not an expandable system for character vs. monster fighting. It is not an RPG for kids. But, it is a fun little game with LEGO bits that will keeps dads and kids engaged.

RATING: 8
Hard one to rate: as a game, in and of itself, it's just roll-and-move.  But as a customisable system, where the kids can make up their own *rules*, it shines. My rating here reflects what I (as a parent) think it's worth (as an experience) to kids, in terms of encouraging their own creativity.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Players play a hero, either a barbarian, a wizard, a paladin, or a druid, invading the dungeon of Fortaan, and trying to recover the Helmet of Protection.  This is the large box set, one of the four in the Lego Heroica series. Players on their turn roll a dice to earn 1-4 movement points to move their piece across the board.  If they end up adjacent to a monster piece, they roll the die again to fight it.  Combat results in either the monster being defeated, or the hero taking damage (or both).  Heroes have a melee or ranged ability that is triggered by one of the die results.  If the hero loses all his life, he must roll on future turns to regenerate back to his four starting life.  The game ends when the goblin boss is defeated - to the victor go the spoils.  Super cute Lego game, where you spend 20 minutes building the board, and about 5 minutes playing the game.  This set has three scenarios, three different monsters (goblin warriors, generals and king), as well as several items to collect.  This is obviously aimed at the under 10 age group, and with that as the target this is a hit and would probably be rated a 6 or 7.  It's definitely the best of the four Heroica sets, in terms of quality and quantity.  For gamers, it's a luck based roll and move game, and you probably should be looking at something like Catacombs for a fast playing dungeon bash, with some strategy and tactics.

(Summary for all the Lego Heroica sets)

Good solid basic intro to D&D concepts for kids; a tad simplistic for adults, but has the bonus that it's made of Lego, so you can make custom expansions or modify the existing components to create new dungeons to explore. Worth having and has certainly been a good gateway drug to get my son into other, more advanced, dungeon-crawler games.

Fun, but could be more expansive. (Yes, we realize that it has multiple expansions.) I like that the dungeon can changed creatively, but the combat is too simplistic (and random) -- roll the die and win or lose, let's see what fate says this time. 

Little strategy involved and no leveling up. Also, it's too easy to win. We find ourselves just delaying the win and going to get treasure chests.

Would like some cooperative rules, or rules for fighting other characters steal items. There are lots of things that could make this game a little more interesting.

My 5-year-old was obsessed with Heroica for awhile. I enjoyed playing with him when he went through that phase. Now that he's out of it, we don't play anymore. This is the biggest and arguably the best of the sets. I enjoyed it most when playing with all 5 sets put together into a large map.

RATING: 7
This is a very light dungeon-crawl... with rules for "overlord" vs players or "every man for himself". It's going to need some tweaking to make it really sing, but the basic idea is very, very cool. My boys (6 & 9) are in love with it.

The kids absolutely love this game. While it's very simplistic, and definitely is not worth the price simply based on how many LEGO bricks are included.
The figures are cool, and probably the biggest selling point of the whole package.

My kids adore it not only because it's LEGO, but because the game is pretty fun. It's easy to play and modular, and since the rules are so basic, it's very easy to start making up your own stuff and adding in your own bits from your LEGO collection.

I'm not really sure why this was discontinued, as it's a fantastic implementation of using LEGO bricks to build your own fantasy adventure games. Likely the sales numbers just weren't there. I do regret not getting more of these LEGO games now that I've had a chance to try Heroica.

A very fun game for the kids, but unless you're a serious LEGO collector, it won't be worth the inflated price tag now that it's OOP.

LEGO Heroica is a great little game.  A kind of kiddo-dungeon crawl.

This module is the biggest and is just a goblin theme but with 3 different setups provided.  The actual mechanics of collecting keys to unlock doors while smashing Goblins on your way to kill the Goblin King.  The simple largeness of the game is the only real setback...lots of turns just slogging along.  Can be linked to other modules.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Introductory dungeon crawl. On the plus side, modular components can be easily changed and/or combined with other Heroica games. The games are best when played in series, and the characters have an opportunity to gain items. On the down side, the game becomes redundant after a few plays. I invested in the series to teach the young gamers in my life the joy of dungeon exploring games.

This rating is from my son's perspective (6 yr old). He loves this game, and asks me to play it all the time. It's a great intro into rpg type games. It is mostly luck based, but the components are awesome. When we finish our games my son will often just spend an extra half an hour just playing with the goblins and heroes. Overall it is a great game for my 6 year old. If you have kids age 5-10 they will most likely enjoy it.

RATING: 6
The Lego Heroica games are nice in that they are modular and intended to be interconnected and expanded.  The base rules are overly simple and intended for young children but with a few custom rules (or a complete overhaul), the boards and system can be turned into a very fun game.

Putting it together was probably the most fun. After a couple of plays, it just becomes the same.  The only real variety is with the different characters you can play.  Probably best if you design your own layouts and winning conditions.

Disclaimer: I did play a mix of Heroica sets, so what I am saying refers to none of them in particular. 

The game is actually rather dull - roll the die, move, if you get close to a monster, you roll the die again. Repeat until reaching the final opponent. There is some fun in the fact that this is Lego, of course, and that you can do your own setup. But from a design perspective, this is definitely uninspired.

I'm surprised by the comparably good rating for a children's game. You walk around, roll the die. Many times it doesn't even matter what you roll as you will be able to jump ahead of the players in front of you anyway to the next empty spot. Potentially, you could buy better equipment but why should you. Collecting the money to buy them is a waste of time as the winner will be the one who rushes straigth to the baddie and kills him with a lucky roll. The only fun is the nonsensical situation of being at Europe's biggest gamer convention and playing this! Even for a simple game like this Lego managed to provide a rule set with huge holes in it. Give me Looping Louie any time instead.

We admittedly bought this for the fantasy LEGOs. That said, the game is roll-n-movey, but has some neat ideas behind it. With some house-rules it could be a decent light RPG. And besides that, it's full of props and Small-sized figures for a LEGO D&D game.

I give all Lego Heroica ratings the same assuming you are playing with the full set. Each game individually doesn't do much, but together it's a) super fun to build the map and b) offers a variety of ways to achieve the goal, a variety of goals, and a variety of ways to stop each other. It's a pity Lego shut down their game line before they could complete the map. I was looking forward to the last three installments.

After three plays with my children (7yr & 10yr):

This game is really fun for them! They are not bothered by the simple mechanism of roll and move and are absorbed by the little choices they can make and the items they can pick up. They are really excited. The game captures their attention fully for half an hour or so.
I my self would rate this game 5, But for my children this is a 10!

RATING: 7.5
Very enjoyable. My rating is towards the high end of my scale for a kids game. My son and I will be playing this for some time, and most likely be getting some expansions and combining with other stuff.

I think Lego has finally hit their sweet spot as far as the customizability aspect of their games - the modular dungeon is well-implemented, and I even feel for once that the rules are actually rules, not (as elsewhere) sort-of an idea for a game, using the "build your own game" angle as an excuse.

Honestly, what makes Heroica work (in part) is that it [i]seems[/i] like you're making a lot of decisions, but for the most part they don't matter. For example, in out first game my son and I took different paths, and I ended up with five gold before he had any. I worried that this would lead to a runaway victory and dampen his enthusiasm for the game. But, money really isn't as important as it seems - once you have enough to buy a weapon, the game is nearly over, and there's a good chance there won't be enough turns left in the game that you'll even get to activate it. But in a game where I'm playing against a seven-year-old, I consider this a good thing! (and whaddya know, he won.)

RATING: 6
Really torn on rating this one!  Using the included rules, and just playing the game in the box, I think I'd give it about a four- the game is too small, and too random.  Many of the rules don't make a lot of sense for such a short game.  HOWEVER, if you add additional sets, or build your own additional rooms with your own Legos, and tweak the rules, you get an awesome game.  And all of this is encouraged by the rules themselves- Lego games aren't just the game in the box, they're about applying your own creativity.  Then I'd give it an eight or so- there is so much potential, you just need to tap it.

Правила совершенно тупы: кинь кубик - походи на сколько выпало или меньше, ещё кинь кубик - на "меч" убей монстра, на "череп" - монстр ранил тебя. Короче, правила - чисто для галочки. Компоненты хороши, но как и всё леговское - их мало для такой цены (учитывая предложения конкурентов).
Таким образом: игра чисто для детей. Можно ещё взрослым для детей сочинять истории про похождения рыцарей в замке/подземелье и одновременно давать детям немного влиять на происходящее (например, с помощью битв на кубике).

[Children's game] Pure distilled awesome wrapped in coolness and delivered in fun-filled fifteen minute bites.

The base set of the LEGO Heroica series. Even when combined with all four expansions, the table space needed is still only about the equivalent of one regular-sized gameboard.

When I first heard of this, I thought that standard minifigs would be more fun and expandable, but actually the microfigs are a lot better as game pieces. Also, it is quite amazing how much thematic detail they have managed to cram into the microfig scale terrain.

Very cleverly designed series: All expansions deliver new types of microfigs and gameplay elements, so all packs are interesting and useful.

Sure, the ruleset is very loose but if you really need to play this with adults only, it is very easy to refine the rules to a reasonable level.

Easy to pack away without total disassembly: I managed to neatly pack all five sets in the boxes of Waldurk and Nathuz. I only had to remove the tiles that connect the large base tiles.

304 pieces, including:
- heroes: barbarian, wizard, druid, knight
- monsters: 6 goblin warriors, 4 goblin guardians, goblin king
- potions: life, luck, speed, strength
- quest item: helmet of protection
- 2 treasure chests
- 5 doors (3 wooden, 1 portcullis, 1 open) and 4 keys
- 12 spare bits not included in the count

A Lego dungeon crawler is a great idea, but like many Lego games the rules lack depth. Adding a few house rules would really beef this one up  - the modular nature of the boards and the intercompatibility of the series are a great feature and could lead to a really epic RPG.

This is a fine family dungeon crawl game, but I couldn't see playing it much with adults.  It's highly random but doesn't have a lot of deep flavor to compensate for that.  It's very easy and fast, there isn't much game here, and there is no reading required; all of these make it useful to play with young kids (anyone old enough to roll and move by counting PIPs).

The main long-term benefit is probably in encouraging kids to make up their own game or changing the rules, since that's a normal "Lego" thing.

The game with the included rules is just a slight improvement over roll and move games. The rating 4 is for that.

But it can serve as a base for an improved game with house rules that will make it a bit more like a real dungeon crawler.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Kids love fixing it up but who's the target audience? The pieces are too small for 5 year olds and below...things will either go missing or keep falling apart. For example, your equipment rack is so tiny. Add gold, health points, bad guys you kill and you'll run out of room in no time. The game is too simple for adults. 

The game itself is a 'rush to the finish' luck driven die-driven dungeon crawl. The multifunction die has pips for movement and symbols to special attack and combat.

The goal is usually to be the first to reach the end point and kill the big baddie there.

Begs for variants to make it more than a simple 'kill the bad guy'. For example, the game Could be first to 10 VPs worth of stuff and assign VPs to enemies, for acquiring weapons etc.

good to get your kids into gaming. out of the box it gets a 5. Its the watered down simple little brother of a good RPG. Make your house rules and you may get a 10 out of this. It is just BEGGING for house rules... That said, view and share some at http://www.your-own-rules.bplaced.net

RATING: 7
I would rate this a 5 but it's rated how my 8 y.o. would: Not much of a game in the box as practically everything is dependent upon a die roll, including how far you move. I played three times with my 8 y.o., and started the first game enthusiastically playing up our actions. By the third game, I was faking it pretty well, but inside I was thinking that this was exactly repeating the previous two plays. We thought of many house rules, and perhaps if she wishes to keep playing we will implement them, but I'd be more than happy if she decided to just play with it as a toy. On the bright side, during our last game, she asked when we could play Castle Ravenloft again.

Lego does Heroquest You can play this co-op or competitively, without the need of a DM. It's pretty simple, so you can easily play this with 5-year olds. But I think I'd rather wait a few years and play Heroquest with them instead.

[Children's Game] Great introductory dungeon crawl for my 6-year old. Basically just roll and move, it does its job well. We played it co-op so as to keep it from being frustrating. 

Not really for adults - go get D&D Ravenloft instead for a similar but more sophisticated experience.

The Heroica games are great for children around 6-7. They are fully making up their own rules and games. The build whatever they like, rolls the die, goes around the board killing goblins and collecting treasures. I can almost see them all grown up doing the same thing :)

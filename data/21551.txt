RATING: 8
Pros: Provides an extremely interesting historical look into the way battles were fought in the game's time frame. All battles must be thought over tactically and strategically for overall victory and the end payoff is satisfying.

Cons: The counter-density/bookkeeping is a little much and while the rules aren't overly complex (for a wargame), the amount of exceptions presents a sometimes tedious game situation.

RATING: 9
One of my favorite games. Unbeatable in terms of scope, accuracy, and tactical  approach. SPQR is a game that requires some time to get into it (the simplified set of rules published by GMT may help). At first there will be a lot of going back and forth between mapboards, rules, and player aid cards, but this is inevitable in order to memorize the and thus learn how to deploy, every unit on the map. This is a game in which, like chess, sacrificing units, may turn out as victorious strategy. Definitely a must to have: a game for serious wargamer....

Rating based on solo play.

Seems to be a rather good, if somewhat fiddly, representation of ancient combat. The interaction between different unit types feel about right, and I think TQ is a good way to abstract different unit capabilities without overcomplicating combat resolution. My only question mark is over rallying and recovering cohesion hits, which seems a bit too easy. The command rules feel slightly gamey, but get the job done and can reflect different levels of command quality.

Having played a few battles, the maneuver dynamics on the battlefield are actually a bit more visible than I expected - looking at photos usually gives a bigger impression of chaos than is really the case, although things do start to break down towards the end of a battle after many units have routed and been rallied.

Overall, a very good game, with the added advantage of having a huge amount of scenarios available.

yes, the bookkeeping is bad - there is a litter of counters all over the field in almost all GBH games.  but SPQR is where the system really shines.  I just wish that there was an edition with 1" counters.  even if if would take 6" of table.

This is the second Berg design I've tried after Men of Iron, and while it is a much better game than the former, I'm not sure it's really the sort of game I'm after.

There are a lot of really great things going on here. I really like the way Command and Control are represented, it makes for an interesting puzzle. I love the way TQ scales, meaning the not only do higher quality troops take cohesion hits less often, but they need more hits to rout. a TQ 8 or 9 troop is really scary, while a TQ 5 troops isn't much to write home about. I like the rally system - but it rarely works unless you have a decent OC.

I'm still trying to get a handle on Roman Cavalry - it seems incredibly shit. I'm also trying to get a handle on the size rating of units and its effect on combat. I'm not sure I like it at the moment, and int he game of heraclea last night I never got the sense that the Romans had anything other than attrition of command and of cohesion to deal with enemy cavalry.

And the fiddliness is ridiculous. It's much, much worse than ASL, and that's saying something. When a line of 40 legionaries crosses a river, that's forty counters that need to be applied. If the legions are double-stacked (ie haven't done manipular line extension yet), it's a real pain. Also it means you run out of bloody 1-hit counters. The constant tiny, irritating exceptions and edge cases are really annoying, and the rulebook is appallingly written. It took us forever to find out what happened when an enemy unit moved adjacent to a leader, and there were constant rulebook references in play.

I find that at about the second hour I am just tired of all the counters. I stop caring if I've got my hits right, and if I'm applying the extra hit for moving troops twice. The idea of putting moved counters on everything makes me want to stop playing, and the idea of crossing the river with another line of troops is so exhausting that even if I need to do it strategically, I won't do it.

I'm also not at all sure how to use the Roman commanders. There are no real strategic notes provided with the game, so I do't know if my tribunes and prefects are meant to pass on the first turn or what. Velites seem to be the worst of both LI and SK worlds, they can't orderly withdraw from any threat and can't really deal with any threat either.

I don't think I like Richard Berg games. The designers' notes are an interesting read historiographically, but most of the time amounts to "there was disagreement and a gap in the literature, so I made it up". That's fine, it's what historians do, and I recognise that he's very well-read on the subject and can probably interpolate with the best historians. I appreciate the research that goes into them, but it's his "games as education" approach that I really loathe.

I have no time for this at all. You don't learn history from games - stop pretending you do. You learn an interpretation of an interpretation of some sources, and the whole project is filtered through the layers of abstraction that translation from greek or latin and the demands of the boardgaming medium make on the designer. Berg is better than most int his regard because he has a sense of the difficulties of historiography, but he still claims that there is a point to his project, which indicates a lack of self-critique.

If you then decide that the scenario shouldn't be balanced because the history wasn't, you're not making any historical sense. You don't understand the past by understanding "what ifs", especially when those "what ifs" aren't connected to historical outcomes. Rome didn't win at Cannae, but it beat Hannibal. Imperfectly re-creating Cannae to see if the Romans could have won makes no difference to the outcome. You will learn nothing useful from the experience and not have fun either. So my biggest beef with his whole attitude is that he is so concerned that the game be a didactic experience that he's forgotten to make it balanced, and claims the lack of balance as a virtue. This claim makes no sense because he should realise that the game can't teach anything worthwhile to the average punter - and probably only has a slim chance of teaching anything worthwhile to the average professional military theorist.

I can't say this clearly enough - the average wargamer learns nothing worthwhile or even really applicable from playing wargames. Wargames say nothing about the politics or culture of the past, and those are the drivers of historical change, not who won or lost battles. Wargames do not challenge notions of the past, they do not critique histories already written. They simply reconfirm already held notions about the past and about war while mechanically re-creating them. Wargames are NOT works of history, they are war porn. Richard Berg's games, with their high-minded claim to be "worthy" war "simulations", are some of the worst offenders.

Enjoying the game. Though GBoH games are so fiddly with all of the markers going on and off of the units. Tweezers are a must.

RATING: 10
The best tactical wargame about ancient Rome to my limited knowledge.

Takes into account two main variables, troop weapons systems and troop quality, to recreate combat in a very convincing and cool way.

Leaders are required to give orders, with some being a lot better than others, even being able to get more than one round of orders in their turn or to trump into a lesser leader's command. 

The command rules have been criticized in depth on csw, with interesting points being made.

Be that as it may, this game still captures the essence of the epicness and historicity of these ancient battles to a non-historian, and I must give it the highest rating ;-)

Absolutely superb game, but not without a couple of pimples. The rules could definitely be organized better, and for a hundred bucks I would expect better quality in the charts/tables; a color illustrated terrain effects chart is the most obvious shortcoming. However, production quality of the maps and counters is first-rate. I like the scenario selection and the way it traces development of the Roman system of warfare. Game turns can be long, but they're always engrossing to fans of the period. There's a tremendous amount of gaming packed in this box.

Comment after two plays of the learning scenario.  Once you get used to the rules, the game moves along at a good pace.

The game produces a good narrative during the battles with routed units retreating away, leaders splitting their time getting their good units to the front while trying to rally the broken units, and engaged units fighting melee battles all over the front line.

There is a lot of counter density, but overall the game is quite enjoyable.  I cannot wait to try one of the larger scenarios.

RATING: 7.5
Complaints: The rulebook is poorly written and simply doesn't hold all of the answers that it should. I've played several scenarios and am fairly sure I'm still getting some of the rules wrong but I can't find clarifications to correct it. I'm pretty sure said clarifications simply aren't there. Oh, and it sucks that the Deluxe box only comes with a handful of scenarios. Although, there are plenty of expansions to this game which offer many, many additional scenarios. This game is the definition of Fiddly.

With all that said, this game is a joy to play. I really, really love how each unit's size value affects the line charges. It really evokes this feeling that some units are quite dense and heavy while others are much lighter formations. It just adds a wonderful depth at very little complexity cost. Charging elephants are awesome fun!

I've only played it via Simple Great Battles of History, so I can only comment on the components, rather than the rules. They're very nice, and it's awesome that someone has gone into such detail on the late Republican Roman army. I also like the historical notes and lengthy, opinionated pontificating in the rule and scenario books - great stuff. The game (played with SGBoH, but I'm sure it would be even more so with full SPQR) really increased my understanding of Roman military history - through actually doing, rather than just reading about it (and yes, I realise the game merely presents one possible model of how it actually worked). And short of actually rampaging around, hacking peoples' limbs off with a Gladius, much as I'd like to, this game is as close as I'll ever get to the real thing.

RATING: 8.5
The game is a extravaganza of colour, flavour and style, but in the end, it is playable.

The rules, although they seem somewhat disorganized, are straight forward. And for the most part fairly "natural".

Counters are beautiful, but a little cluttered, especially leader counters are to be studied, to know which number represents which ability.  

Game flows rather slowly, but really shows the flow of ancient warfare (or as I guess it would be).

Full GBoH rules seem a lot better match then the SGBoH rules, which are not that much simpler and don't save that much time. They do however save a lot tracking-counters (and the game is very tracking-counter heavy)

Previously owend this in the mid 1990's. Didn't really get it at that time. I have recently managed to reacquire a copy via the November 2010 EU Math Trade. Hopefully I will get on with it a little better this time around.

Finally got around to giving this a go. Have only just finished punching the counters and reading up the rules. Have tinkered about trying to learn the system for a while but, tonight I finally played out a complete solo game of the basic trial game. Now I have got a little play under my belt I will move on to the historical battles soon I hope. Really loving this system now. It was/is a challenge but definitely a rewarding challenge getting to know the system. On the look out for more of this type of thing now!

Have since bought the delux version as well as a number of the expansions. Thought that it is a must have system for me so worth the investment. Have merged this entry with the older edition for records.

Played the basic introductory game with one Roman Allied Legion against a small Carthaginian force led by Hannibal. Romans pretty much beaten up but not before both Carthaginian Phalanxes had routed and were eliminated. Only needed to get 24 points against Carthage and managed 28 points due to Phalanxes being worth double TQ points for elimination. Romans had technically lost nothing but had numerous routed units making their way back to the retreat edge. Carthage braking first is the only thing that saved them!

I wanted to have some good Ancient game. But SPQR(and GBoH) does not make it for me. Simple rules are too simple and full rules are bad for me either. I do not like activation system which seems odd to me with so many preemptions, continuations, etc. In full game units are covered with so many markers (cohesion hits, low count of missiles, etc...)

So this was probably biggest disappoitment for me.

RATING: 7.5
Very detailed, maybe too much so for the little information that is available historically? 

I played mostly Roman vs Barbarians using the Simple GBOH rules. At first, most battles look like static lines crashing into each other, however a couple of turns in the real game shines through, which is mostly about command and control of ancient armies. 

It's good and has very good designer notes, but I wish there were more smaller (half-map) scenarios.

Nice CDG: has to be played in five players for fulling appreciating the narrative. 
Great chances for almost all players to set back even when everything seems lost.
Learned in one hour, and played a full game at "swisswargames convention" held in Lugano, November the 12th 2017. had lot of fun.
tried to play with less players, but it loses lot of its potential

Got it for 35 Euros at Essen- what a steal!  Dove in headfirst and tried the Bagradas Plaines scenario.  Need some rules help, obviously, and even more tactical help, but getting the flow of the game.  Very exciting, but very messy battle.  Really want to play more of this now I'm getting the hang of it, but probably against an opponent.  Got to play against James and we finished one whole turn.  Exciting!  Really has a great 'feel', and I could see my flank dissolving, and the elephant line was imposing, but I still had my main lines uncommitted and solid as his commanders were in a bit of disarray.  Need to play this more!  

Have since played Tincitus River from a C3i article, and it was fast and furious.  Liking this even more!

An astonishing game, the amount of work the designers have put into this has to be greatly admired.

A truly excellent command and battle system.

IMHO deserves to be ranked among the top 1/2 dozen wargames.

A game I would highly recommend for ancients fans.

But not for those with limited time.

RATING: 8
I want to rate this a solid 10 because I love it. Historical accuracy, and great value for money (lots of scenarios). This game rewards knowing your units and how to fight with them effectively. This is not a dicefest.

However the rules are horrendous. Inconsistent language, cluttered rules, no index, errors, lots of errata, even in its 3rd edition. Grab the index here on BGG, and search the rules forum for info.

Another thing that bugs me is the counter clutter. Stacking limit are low, but there are a lot of status markers which leads to stacks of counters. Ancient combat means lots of melee, so lots of stacks together. I need to get some tweezers ...

If you really want to understand how these armies fought, look no further. I play with GBoH rules because (IMHO) the Simple rules gut the interesting parts of playing this game and it is not that much more simple than playing with the full rules. If you have this game and the latest version of Alexander, you have a lifetime of ancient battle fun.

I have played the 2nd edition a couple of years ago. The refreshing look of the maps and the 3rd edition rules are great. The best in this package is that all modules are included. (before Barbarians)
Still a wonderful game, not light but it gets intuitive after a couple of turns.

I have to admit that I'm rather disappointed at the errata for the game.  There are a lot.  Numerous printing errors and if you want corrected counters you have to buy C3i #21.  There _is_ a ton of game in the box, though.  

Battles can get tedious, with pre-shock TQ checks, referencing the charts to find what column to roll on, collapse checks.  Lots of "wristage."  This is a slow, process-heavy game that works best when the two sides run at each other.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Rating is with SGBoH rules. 

Beautiful counters. Goofy, pompous campaign notes, with almost "comical" overuse of quotations.

Unit differentiation is portrayed nicely. Evokes a strong feeling of the clash of arms, and the vulnerability of flanks (which is absent from C&C: Ancients).

Game emphasizes troop quality, timing, and decisive contact. Don't expect to see many swings of fortune.

I`m GBoH fanboy, so buying this one was a matter of time. Well, Deluxe version certainly has a lot to offer. I like it less than Alexander because of my Greek bias and feeling that SPQR battles are bigger. Bigger in my book not always mean better, you see... (and I don`t have my companions anymore... and Alexander to roll for momentum on flank! Come on! :D)

Fun game but full of speculations and historical mistakes ( have a look at Cannae and laugh... ). Despite its pretentions, the systeme completely fails to simulate the momentum of ancient armies.

One of GMT's masterpiece. This is a huge game, heavily supported (at least one scenario in each C3i magazine) that deserves more than just a look.

There's an incredible amount of gaming in this package, including a lot of famous and interesting battles.

SPQR is the definitive Ancient Tactical Battle wargame covering the Roman Republic era from the Rise of Rome (Barbarian module) until the end of the Second Punic War.  Players must learn both what troops are good for as well as bad at AND how to use/reuse his given leaders.  Especially important regarding use of leaders is when to/not to use the trump option during each leader's activation.  This mechanic is utilized by RHB in many of his games and his widely misunderstood by many of his detractors.

The GBoH system (of which SPQR is merely one part) stands as the mark by which all other tactical ancient battle games/systems are measured.

I requested this game (Xmas list) because I love the art style, but had no idea how it would play and it turned out to be surprisingly good. Pattern matching and set collecting is simple for kids and the limited actions available make it easy to pick up and remember.

The gameplay reminded me of a cross between Takenoko's objective cards and Labyrinth's gameplay but neither felt that satisfying. The art work was striking but too polarising in our opinion with neither Lea nor myself really engaging with it. Sold it on after one play. It's OK as a game but a little fiddly and long for what it ought to be. Simply not as charming as Takenoko or as immediate and simple as Labyrinth. Can't recommend it. The artwork is hugely distracting, with its washed out pastel colours and oddly sexualised imagery (stay with me here) distracting players: from vacant staring 'friend' animals that look like a six-year-old girl's stuffed toys, to sperm-like player tokens stalked by a dreaming 'nightmare' that is clearly a teenage girl's head, it feel like you're trapped inside a prepubescent girl's hormone-induced night terror. Neither scary nor arty really, just oddly yucky. That box art doesn't help matters either. It needed a whole other art direction.

Great art doesn't make a great game.  The objectives are unbalanced, the player-interaction is inane (you spend one action to flip a tile, they spend once action to flip it back), and the components fail to accomplish the objectives of games components.

Good moving puzzle game - does have an easy win mechanic that is a bit luck based (wildcard points). Love the whimsical art, unique gameplay, and amount of strategic thinking required to score well.

It's a mediocre but pretty game. Played it at Gen Con. Wouldn't seek it out. The dual player token card claiming is a fine abstract mechanic, but it doesn't do a lot for me. Action points in an abstract is also an odd choice.

Amazing game! Love playing this and will never turn down a game. The mechanics are simple- rotate a tile, get a card from the line, refresh the card line, play a card, move a character pawn- but the strategy in this game is so deep! The game end trigger is when someone places their 7th card; finish the round and tally up your score.

[b]Sold 12/10/2017[/b] - A neat game with gorgeous art, and a thinky puzzle, but rarely got it to the table.  This was one that we deliberated on a lot before deciding to sell.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Very reminiscent of [thing=37696][/thing] but a lot simpler and a lot quicker. The doorways of the tiles should possibly have been a little bigger and more obvious.

We jumped straight in adding the nightmare variant and it is both a help and a hindrance which is good, and i am looking forward to adding the 'advanced' cards and the tile flipping ability.

Really nice whimsical art in this one however the colour palette is fairly insipid and washed out and that makes it difficult to discern background of the tiles at a glance which leads to AP as you really have to study the board to work out where the tile you are looking for actually is.

when the game arrived it immediately became one that hits the table most frequently. very playable. it did take quite a bit longer when we played with 3 players instead of 2

I'm afraid the designer/artists failed to consider colour blind individuals with this game. I got through it, but only with the assistance of the other players. I got by with the main cards as the patterns were distinct enough. Just. Though I did get confused with the backgrounds at times. But I kept moving other player's tokens.

A cute puzzly concept with good artwork (if you like Adventure Time, especially) but the gameplay is simplistic and the color palette becomes a hindrance as there are a lot of distracting visual elements on the cards and they wash out a bit. If you want cool art, play Dixit or Mysterium, if you want a puzzly game, play Cacao or Carcassone.

I've had the chance to playtest this one a few times, now, and I have to say it lives up to its promises: super easy to learn, challenging to master, FUN to play.

I always enjoy games with tough decisions, and this one has plenty. There's real satisfaction in making clever moves and picks that allow you to link your cards and sets and maximize your points. Though VERY different games, it FEELS a lot like Arboretum to me. (And I love that game).

Add to that the AWESOME artwork, and I'll be anxiously waiting by my mailbox for this one to be delivered.

Played 1 game of this with 4 players. It was OK, but it felt like the objective cards may not be that balanced and more than a little luck in the friend draw. Not much interaction, but fairly quick. Somehow it wasn't quite satisfying enough to feel worth the effort required to plan effective turns but this may well improve with familiarity.

RATING: 5
Beautifully drawn cards and an interesting concept, but the rules are written terribly - could've done with a lot of paraphrasing and without creating so much confusion. Card designs again look lovely but the information on them isn't immediately intuitive. With a bit of tweaking of the rules wording + card format, would rate higher. I do like the fact there's an advanced rule set, but didn't get around to it.

A decent game marred by eyesore graphic design.  The use of colors is truly bizarre and makes it very difficult to play the game.  The cardboard standees are too big and constantly block your vision of the locations and the pathways.  Not one I am ever likely to play again because of the poor graphic design.

I snap purchased this based on the art as with everyone else I know that owns this game. I figured even if it had horrible game play, I still loved the art.

***I give it an 7 for art style and easy mechanics, but it's so easy that it could get boring after multiple plays. Also, it would've been nice for the terrain and the characters to be on the same side of the player card so I didn't have to keep flipping over.

This game is entertaining and a light quick easy to play. I find it a little too simple for most situations and I don't think I will be able to get my usual play group to play much. However, the simplicity of the base rules makes me think I can pull this game out with new people and easily start a game. This will be a good filler game for me I think. Also, I think it will be a great game for younger players. The age listed is 13+ but my 8 year old niece was able to understand the base game and really enjoyed it.

A really well-designed abstract game with very appealing artwork. Has some similarities to Five Tribes, especially with the AP and contemplative aspects, but I do like this one a lot better. The only reason I don't rate Dreamwell higher is because I tend to dislike abstract games, and I don't think it's exciting enough to make me want to play it all the time. The game works, but I don't know that I would consider it to be that fun to play.

Art style of this game is not to my taste, the colours are very similar and characters seem like they should be in a children's book.

That said, there is an interesting game in there with some tactics and planing needed, although not a lot of player interaction on the basic level, so it did just feel like we were playing by ourselves.

I played the non-advanced version of the game and enjoyed it quite a bit. It gave me the same feel as Takenoko (even though rules wise aren't similar), though with more thinkiness. I can see it being a solid one as a two player game, maybe a lunch time game.

Ir is however AP prone if you want to ensure you make the best move.

Very pretty game with decent complexity for a simple game.

You have to figure out how to score your cards, and balance the efficiency of scoring with the strength of the VIP / set collection values of the cards.

This is currently my favorite game to play within 30 minutes (with 2p).

RATING: 6
[b]basic game[/b] [b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6 [/bgcolor][/b] — A very tactical, slightly strategic abstract logistics game, but it's a nice, quick, family-friendly challenge. Of course, Tara's art is what drew me to the game, and it's everywhere, so that's good!

[b]advanced game[/b] TBD — All it adds is flipping the tiles and the few advanced friend cards, but this should add some interesting new tactics when playing. Note, though, that flipping a tile switches its background and character to known values, so this gives the players more control on their turn, but ought to cause more tumult between your turns. I suspect these aspects will balance one another, but I definitely plan to play this way from now on.

[b]nightmare variant[/b] TBD — This adds a feature that just sounds vindictive, and not conducive to my family's or friends' play styles, so I have low expectations for this, which is too bad, because I'm fond of the illustration of nightmare figure.

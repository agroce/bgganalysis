A nice quick card game that would suit more than 2, less than 5 players.  A very different theme (quite cool, by the way!) which might appeal to a wider audience.  Very fast game - our first 2 games lasted about 10 minutes!  Not Reiner's best work but fine to play.

it's not going to set the world alight, but it does what it does pretty well.  this is a great game for those moments where you don't know how long it's going to be before the others show up and you don't want to get in a really involved game.  you know, even when something like for sale would be too much to start playing because of timing.

Mean little card game.  Played with two and enjoyed it.  Want to play with more to see if this settles in at a 7 or a 6.  9/09-played with three.  Still very quick and I still like it but not sure if it should be a 7 or 6.

Jan 2014 - Played with 3 again but liked it a ton more now.  Quick but not without real decisions.  I can see this becoming a top filler for our group. Up to an 8 now.

We have Trendy and play 2-player.  I didn't like this game much at first but it has grown on me.  It only takes a couple minutes to learn this game, and it plays quickly.  The fashion theme is different and leads to some funny table talk.  We played once with four players, which also worked nicely.

I don't love it, but I do like the game.  And it's fast. What's not to like?  I like it. But no one I play with seems to like this light, fast game as much as I do--not true love, but true like. Who knows if I will ever get to play it again? The theme works. 2010 Update: I'm determined to bring this out again!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Not bad, but not anything extraordinary either.  Yet another of the Knizia "numbers on a card with funky scoring" games, this one at least has a few laughs and hilarious upsets going for it.  Short, harmless, and ultimately shallow.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Production: Passable art on "Trendy" edition; functional, but nothing more.  Play: There really isn't much to this game, strategy-wise; if a design is going to break through, it's better to be on the band wagon than off.  But the game is quick and relaxing, and points are easy to come by.  (1+1+2) (1 play)

RATING: 8
Excellent filler, I've rated it as a filler game.  (For the record, it's not as good as For Sale, but better than Money, two similar weight card games we use for filler around here).  Takes 3 minutes to learn, a hand plays in 10 minutes.  On top of that, it's fun and it has a drop of strategy.

Not sure why I picked this off the prize table at the gathering.  There wasn't much left, admittedly.  I guess there is some fun to be had by asking "who is trendy" in your most pretentious fake german accent (or real one for those of you who speak german).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Ultra simple Reiner Knizia card game themed on fashion design.  On a turn, players simply play a card in one of five suits.  If the "out" number is reached, that designer is launched, earning points, and trashing the other designers on the table.  Amazingly simple, but it works because you have to ally with somebody to get a designer launched.  The trick is doing it so you come out ahead.  Very clever.  This is seeing a lot of table time.

RATING: 2
* Played 15+ times. Doesn't really work very well with 2 players. I heard this game made for addictive filler: the filler I get, the 'addictive' I don't. Ultra-light, and way too much bandwagon jumping (resulting in every getting nearly the same points.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Depending on who you play with, it can be fun.  With kids who are easily miffed, the adults must play forgivingly.  Adults will not find so much of a challenge.  A weak offering from the master gamesmith Knizia.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Perhaps I had better bought the Trendy instead of Crazy Derby version, as I like that theme better. As for the game itself, I like it better if played by only 2 or 3 players (7/10) instead of 4 or 5, as then you don't have any control at all (5/10).

Very easy to learn, plays quickly (10  minutes), & takes very little space to play (draw pile & small discard area is all that is needed) so is good for playing on a plane or train. We have the Trendy version. Gets a bit raucus for some reason...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Enjoyable light card game simulating the fashion industry.  You attempt to either follow the trend and collect points when the designer breaks out or attempt to start a new trend hoping others will follow.  There's also some cards that can throw a designer out of fashion.   Good for family or non-gamers.  Is also solid filler for gamers.

I had to get the Crazy Derby version by Ravensburger, and finally found it for cheap.

It has become a lunchtime favorite at work.  It plays simply, but is quite fun.  We usually only play one time through the deck for simplicity.  However, the game is best played for 3 cycles through the deck.  This spreads the odds and requires some consideration regarding who you work with.  A very simple, straightforward game of collaboration.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A light card game, with a silly theme, that is actually kind of amusing.  The artwork and production is just okay.  Plays very quickly, and makes for a fine enough filler.

[Crazy Derby] A surprisingly pleasant family card game, one that is fast, simple and light, but still interesting enough to keep people engaged. Might be a little too low-cal for gamers, though.

When you accept this game for what it is, an extremely light, quick filler, I think it really satisfies.  If players approach it wanting meaty decisions or an analytical exercise, I can see how disappointment would loom.  But the simplicity is impressively unique.  Like in other Knizia designs like Loco!/Flinke Plinke, one can't help but wonder how something so simple can work so well.  I guess the most evident flaw is the graphic design, which heavily dates the game.

Okay, I'll admit it can be kind of fun if you get into the theme but there really isn't much to this mindless card game. You either have the cards to score or stop others from scoring - or you get left behind as the others rack up points. The best thing I can say is that it requires very few brain cells and is over quickly. I think my first impression/comment was pretty much on the mark - this is Modern Art for morons :-)

In some way this is like Mamma Mia in that you need to watch varying volumes of colour, and decide which card to play accordingly. Now I like following such simplistic matters most times rather than detail, and Trendy's novel card distribution can be easily monitored as you determine which 5 fashion labels potentially score (not unlike Modern Art without the auctions, except only the most count). In Trendy, when you score nearly everyone else scores; so there is the battle of oneupmanship or join the stragglers, or try a solo effort. Out cards cancelling fashions in play provide tension and group groans. A constant delight.

As much as I love games by Knizia, many of his card games just don't make the cut. Trendy is one of those games where gameplay is pretty dull and the lack of control is somewhat annoying. This gets beter with only two players, but why play such an average game with two when there are so many alternatives?

Not a trick-taking game, not a rummy game, not a stops game....  Once again, using very simple rules material, Dr. Knizia presents a fresh and entertaining idea.  The fact that this has gone over so well with so many different groups boosts my rating.

[Spiel Spass 'Trendy' 2000 edition] {Fashion; hand management; optimal 3-5p} Trendy is a very simple card game. I really admire Knizia for his ingenuity in designing good games with simple rules. Trendy is fun and interactive. Similar to most other Knizia's card games, Trendy has a few function cards that create surprises and provide tactics. Depending on style of players, it can be played cooperatively or nastily; esp. the low-value cards can be used to discard all other high value cards.  This card game is only mildly luck dependent if players pay attention to what other players are doing.  It's exciting to see which designer can breakthrough in a competition :)

The illustration of the cards is effective but dry.

[New edition] I like the animal theme more, which is cuter.

３人からできて（多いほうが楽しいけど）、時間もかからず、
インストも簡単でそれなりに盛り上がる。
とてもとても便利なゲーム。
絶版で手に入りにくい模様。

Trendy was really fun.  Great filler and generated some good laughs.  Would probably get samey pretty quickly but great to bust out on an infrequent basis.

This game was horrible.  It basically had no redeeming characteristics to it at all.  It was a totally luck fest card play mechanic and take that kind of game.  Decisions were all basically made for you based on previous plays, not much in the way of strategy or tactics at all.

RATING: 6
Simple game that isolates and explores one of Knizia's recurring themes: mechanics that force players to adjust their play based on how the group-think is trending at the moment. Solid if not spectacular.

I had a great 10 minutes playing this even though I got crushed. I'm sure I could teach others and get more fun out of this. My rating could easily fall over time, but at this time, I just want to play again!

Having learned Horse Fair first, I just assumed that I would like the original and elegant Trendy more.  Not so.  This is a case where the sequel beats the original by giving a point kicker to the person who completes each set.  Trendy is simply passé without it.

I like to think of this as a mini-Modern Art. You have a hand of cards whose value you can only convert if you can convince the other players to contribute to that value. Whoever best controls the appraisal process of the table stands the best chance of winning--unless someone hammers them with their "Out" cards. I know I am giving this game too much credit, but if you're looking for a quick game with much moaning and groaning and a dash of psychology, give this a try.

This is another simple Knizia design - he is usually hit or miss with these light fillers - this is one of those near misses.

Surprisingly,  the theme actually fits and the artwork has a retro feel that works very well here.  It is an extremely basic game in which you choose to follow suit or buck the trend and lead another.  Of course there are risks / rewards that come with each decision - and there are a few special cards to spice up the game play a bit.

There are no wow moments - but as a multi-player affair it can be a quick,  enjoyable experience.

Another fun, fast, simple game by Reiner. Definite family fair, with enough going on to keep everyone involved. I wouldn't want to play it all night, but not all games are meant for that.

Not a lot to this game, but it is good when you want something simple and not intimidating. The theme is definitely different.

"Crazy Derby" version
Animal racing instead of clothing trends.

Simple card game with some good screwage.  Do you want to join the IN group, or blow them out of the water on the fashion runway?  Likely to get a lot more plays.

A simple Knizia game of set collection. The twist is that the set collection comes from a collective and cooperative effort. Winners of the most current complete set gets to keep the cards for scoring while any remaining half-completed sets are discarded. Play goes on round and round until all cards are exhausted. A classic Knizia numbers game.

A short end-of-day distraction that is worthy of occasional replay, but nothing epic or thought-provoking. Still, being a fan of Knizia, I do like it.

Lightest game I've played to date.  Easy to learn, fun, would work with a broad range of ages, probably as young as 5 or 6 rather easily.  Might have to help a little with the math, but the concept is easy.

Replayings of this game reveal more strategy involved than first meets the eye.  It's not a deep game, by any stretch of the imagination, but there are some choices to be made each turn, much like you would have with a trick-taking game.  I also like that the tactics change just slightly when playing with different player numbers.  Heck, it's just a simple, thoughtful little game that isn't terribly taxing.

2 plays: 3 players
4 plays: 4 players
5 plays: 5 players

Fun filler game that even works well with two, although it's better with more. The only turnoff is when you have, say, five players and everyone floats a 5, thus netting no one a gain. More screwage, please!

A simple number game with fun built in. A great game to introduce non-gamers to TGOO. A good game for the ladies, me thinks.

Crazy Derby is a good little card game - animals are racing to the finish and the cardplay of all the players together will determine the winner.  If its a close finish, you don't know which animal is going to win each round.  I like the fact that the "LOSER" cards affect only the animals and not specific players.  Good for children.

Very good when played with 4 or 5, less so with 3. A solid, light filler.

RATING: 5
Some groupthink games - where players pool their efforts to score a jointly-shared commodity - do actually work: Chicago Express, Modern  Art, etc.  Others fall flat because players are much too quick to jump on the conformist VP bandwagon.  Trendy is a perfect example of the latter.

For families, though, the Crazy Race version isn't bad.

Fun, light fare with very quick play. As long as you play a long series of hands, and accept that any crazy card game like this will be full of luck and asymmetrical "take that!" play from the players, it's good, clean fun. I'd definitely play it again.

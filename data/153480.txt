From time to time, Zoch comes with a good trick taking game. Scharfe schoten is a very good example of it. You have to consider a lot of things in making your choices.

RATING: 7.9
I have always been a fan of declaration whist but I do feel that the game too often comes down to the last player to declare a bid to leave the combined bid total to be one higher or one lower than the number of tricks available and the discards you make are not always very interesting.  This takes everything good about the game and packages it in a way that will appeal to modern board gamers.  You bid simultaniously on what you will get the most and least cards of and there is a lot you can do to control the outcome.  You also know the suits of your opponents cards .  Lots of fun want to play it more.  Not as interesting or exciting as Tichu but a smaller barrier to entry.

My favorite trick-taker of 2014 and probably in my top 5 climbing/trick-takers of all time (Tichu, Clubs, Sticheln, Scharfe Schoten, ? ).  

It's a neat game where each round players bid on the suits they'll take the most and least of in that round.  The suits are ordered and at the end of each trick, the player with the highest card in the highest suit played wins the trick (normal trick-taking rules).  After 3 plays, I'm still not sure how to play it.

Initial Rating: 8 with upward mobility.

RATING: 6
There's one absolutely marvelous feature in the game and that's the cards which have two sided cards (other side has the normal number and color information and the other side shows color). This gives information for other player in a way which I like a lot.

What I did not enjoy as much is the rather complex trump system where figuring out which trump is higher than others is too difficult. Scoring felt also too much heavily oriented towards getting both of your predictions right. I would have also tried to come up with different way of making the predictions than the counters they offer in the game since they were fiddly and tough to hide from other players.

All in all I'm willing to play more and had a good time during my first play.

RATING: 8
A trick taking game with a twist. The colored back sides of the cards together with the spice rack provide ample possibilities to devise tactics (and get screwed by your fellow gamers). 

Needs a couple of plays to discover the depth of calculating your odss and to correctly evaluate the risks you are taking.

RATING: 6
The major selling point of Scharfe Schoten is that the colour of the cards is marked on the back so you always know which colours your opponents hold. The rest is not quite your standard trick-taking with predictions of which colours you'll get the most and fewest cards of thrown in. Not bad, but ultimately not that memorable in the great trick-taking world, either.

Very strange trick taking game. Very hard to tell hand strength and I usually don't have a problem gauging that so it turns into a bit of a luck fest.

A clever take on the trick taking game, having to predict the most or the least of a suit and randomized trump cards adds quite a fun twist to the game.

I quite liked this game, as there is more control than in tt games where taking more tricks is better.  In addition, other players affect which cards you can get, but you have some control over how you choose to play your hand.

Quite difficult to master, I didn't do particularly well in my one play. I enjoyed it - but it doesn't seem to fill a void in my collection, so I might not be able to keep it. Good design, though. If you like trick taking games, give this one a shot.

Besides the weird theme and artwork, it is a decent trick-taking game. I like that the cards show their color on the back: there is no way to renege, be it intentional or not.

RATING: 4
It's a trick taking game where people had tons of cool ideas and decided to put them all in the same game which ended up being too much. Cool features:

All cards can trump other suites, there is a chain of suits. Some card numbers are super trumps, but they change all the time which makes it confusing and hard to remember.

The trick planning is just annoying and boring.

I've played a ton of trick-taking and card games, and this one is very quirky and weird.  I don't know if I just stink at it or it's just got be all confused as what my best path should be.

Another German trick taking game with some odd twists.  In this one you must follow suit if you can, but then each of the four colors are of different trump power and then there are also four individual cards that are super trumps.  You seek to predict which color you will take the most cards and in which color you will take the least.  If you are correct in both without tying, you also get a bonus of the differential between the two.  One also takes a card from the middle whenever one wins a trick.  I like it!

Quite a bit to think about in this trick taking game.  

Before each round, you have to state which color you will win the most cards in and which color you will win the least cards in.  Normally, you'd just be considering what's in your hand.  However, in this game, you can tell which colors your opponents have because of the back of the cards match the color on the front.  So, you'll take into consideration the colors they possess.  There are also cards you take when you win a trick so you have to consider the colors available there.  On top of that, the strength of each color changes each round so certain colors will trump other colors in a trick.  Then, there are super trumps so even if red is stronger than green this turn, there is one red card that can beat almost any green.   For example, if a 4 green is super trump, it will beat all reds except for the red super trump.  It can really twist your mind at times.

Each hand you'll be taking a lot of the same things into consideration.  You have to follow suit, if possible, but there will be a lot of hands where you have some flexibility on what you can play.  Then you have to decide if you want to actively try to win the trick, poison the pot for the person you think will win the trick, or save certain cards for a later hand.  Lots of small, tough decisions.

In this game, it feels like a lot of time you won't want to win the trick so the card play isn't automatically.  You have to stop and think how playing each card could play out.  Looking forward to many more plays!

Like most TTWATs, hard to evaluate initially. More than any other trick-prediction game, I still feel like I'm guessing wildly based on feel rather than analysis, even though distribution is a major input. Has the potential to be very good.

A rather clever idea ruined by the fact that if you get a hand that won't win any tricks, there is very little you can do to affect other players' scores and you are likely to lose the game.

Awesome game! So unique for a trick taking game. You know the suits everyone has by the backs of the cards. I loved playing this game and trying to figure it out. Really clever and I want a copy soon. I suspect the more I play it the higher the rating. Really fun game. I love trick-taking games anyway.

Yet another tricktaker with a twist - or in this case, several twists. The most interesting is that the suit of each card is marked on its back, so everyone knows when you're void in a suit.

 this is a really fun little trick taker. i have to get a copy for myself. i try out a fair number of new trick takers and they usually seem kind of meh - but this one is quite interesting. it is a little like Sticheln in that you have a "pain suit" (it's not called that, but the concept is the same).

RATING: 7
Trick-taking game with a hierarchy of suits and coloured card backs that allow players to see which suits other players have. The point is to correctly predict the suits with the greatest and least number of cards you will collect by the end of the hand. It's difficult to discern good strategy.

Ended the day with this odd little trick-taking game. It's pretty cool, although also very weird! It should be a lot of fun for fans of trick-taking games. I enjoyed it, although I am terrible at predicting these things!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Trick-taking game: 4 suits 1-12, must follow suit if possible, playing 1 hand/player. The twists:
- card backs show color and must be held so everyone can see them!
- each round, randomly assign 4 numbers (1-12) to the 4 colors. These cards are arranged in descending order and indicate the suit priority. Also, the color-number combinations specify super-trumps (the 4 highest cards in the game!)
- in 4er game, deal 10 cards per player; the remaining are grouped by color and placed in the center; when you win a trick, must also take one of these cards (all cards taken are grouped in personal display)
- at start of each hand, players simultaneously select the colors they think they will take the most/least cards (comparing only at their own cards taken)
- at end of each hand, if you correctly predicted your most/least suits, each is worth 5 pts; if tied for most/least, only 3 pts; if earned pts for both suits, also score the difference (most - least) in pts

Decks are 4x12 (not counting non-playing trump or number cards). You deal 10/player, assign a number to each color (spice) as super trump and to set spice strength, then players secretly pick a spice to take the least and most of. Each trick, if you can't follow suit, you can trump by playing a stronger spice (or duck with a weaker spice). A super trump can be played following suit or if you're void. Each deal scores 5 for a perfect prediction, 3 for most or least with another spice tying; if you get 5+5 you also get the difference between the spices, which is maybe unbalanced.

RATING: 5
Eh. This worked, but I never felt like I have many options for much control. In fact, in several hands with three players (which theoretically should give more control than a four-player game), I picked the same most and least goals as another player (same person) several times in a row, allowing the third player to run away with the game. All three of us were very, very experienced trick-taking card game players, and the strong consensus was that there's not much you can do with a middling or weak hand.

RATING: 8
First play impression: Excellent! Predicting which colors you'll take can be pretty difficult, and the prediction feels a lot different from similar trick-taking games. You have to consider which colors will trump other colors, which cards are supertrumps, which colors your opponents have, and which cards are in the spice cupboard.

As a trick-taking fan, this one seems really promising. Will rate after more plays.

I like trick-taking games, but I'm not as much of a fan of those where only part of the deck is dealt out. This is one of those, and since you have to predict which suits will be your weakest and strongest, it makes it even worse.

Similar to but more complex than Carcassonne.  More of a gamers game because of the strategic depth, Depends upon you seeing the possibilities for clever play.  Definitely fits in the super filler category.

Gee, it's really hard to say.  I can see a lot of similarity to Carcassonne, but with more complex scoring.  I like the ability to smite civilizations, and so on, so it feels like a god game.  More a "Hmmm, interesting" then a "Hell, yeah!"

Decent tile-laying game that feels like a stock simulation.  Kind of chaotic in the random draws, but the player-timed scoring and hidden end are excellent.

RATING: 8
A fun tile-laying-plus game.  Definitely some player interaction since you can alter the landscape, even after tiles are put down.  I like how players don't have individual colors and are free to raise, and destroy, civilizations.  (A little bit of a G-d complex?  Nah.)  A fun game that I strongly recommend.  I bought it blind after hearing Z-Man wax poetic about it.  I'm very glad that I did - it's a great game!

This game is not Carcassonne. Don't expect it to be.

I'm not liking this as much as I think I should.  So far, a couple of players end up with all the cubes from the big civs, and the others are running low on cubes and can't break into the monopoly.  Frustration abounds.  I think patience is key in this one.  Don't spend your scoring tokens until you can make a really nice move with them.

RATING: 6
Comparisons to Carcassonne strike me as lazy.  This is a much more fluid game with a lot more to think about, much more screwage, and greater potential for clever moves producing dramatic results.  

A few things bother me.  Temple scoring, where a player can gain three or four points just by drawing the right tile, can make the difference in a close game.  The game ending mechanism of the epoch tiles can cause the game to end before it really develops.  The more I play, the more that appealing fluidity feels like chaos as carefully built up positions are obliterated between turns.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Weird stock-markety tile laying game. A couple of the screws feel a bit loose, though... the Epoch tiles randomness in particular, and with a more even distribution of them it plays quite nicely. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.65
Rating after 4 two-player games over 5 days.  Plenty to like here as a two player game.  While it feels chaotic as a two player there really is substantial strategy and control.  Complaints about trying to keep Civs alive or "overpowing" Civs that absorb all others are not grasping the fine points of tile placement and the balance act that must be struck between destructive and constructive play.  Ultimately a balance in followers between players becomes ideal for constructive play.  Once the balance is broken, destructive play must be the rule.  The scoring tokens are key but using your final scoring token and allowing your opponent to choose the timing of the end game can be a big mistake.  2-player games range from 45-60 minutes and are highly recommended.

RATING: 5
Abstract tile laying game that is similar to Tigris and Euphrates, but has much more randomness with the complete destruction of civilizations.  With T&E, you have the ability to keep tiles defensive and have greater control of when conflicts occur.  

It fills more of a "casual" tile laying game compared to T&E, but the amount of "take that" mechanic in the game is a bit high for the seriousness of the game.  

Also, drawing the epoch tiles can be very "swing-y" and having a non-trivial portion of scoring based on when a random tile is drawn is not an ideal game for me.

Also, card draw dictates whether or not you get a temple to score on, which then can be streaky.  Yes, you can possibly not draw the color(s) you want in T&E, but it is less swingy in this game and is much more predictable.  With T&E, you can hold 6 cards, which can mitigate risk a bit, but being able to only hold 1 tile from one round makes it significantly more random.

This game is a lot of fun; a cross between Carcassonne and Tigris & Euphrates.  It is less of a brain burner than T&E and less chaotic than Carc, which turns out to be a nice combination.

not sure what to say about this one.  two hosed tries, one where followers weren't granted on civ creation and both had scoring chips score for all players.  the first game was a disaster, the second i think played ok despite the flubbed rule, or at least provided a sense of how it might play.  there wasn't a particular spark for me, but i remain curious enough to try it with 2 players to see if the back-and-forth nature will be more inspired.

Nice clear board.  I was put off initilly by the triangular tiles - my loss.  Replacing tiles (or playing over the earlier ones, which is easier) add a nice twist.  Must remember to take a cube when not founding a civilisation - or play with people that remind mne :-)  Another winner from Zev.

Two games in and I have really enjoyed both playings.  There is a lot going on for such a simple game.

It allows scoring in several different methods, the most innovative in allowing you to score points when you want to, not when something happens during the game.  

The game has a nice feel to it, the rules are streamlined and the game itself is beautiful.   The civilization aspect of the game is well thoughtout and each of the three resources, wheat, luxury and swords are balanced well.

This certainly has a chance to become an alltime favourite for me.  I look forward to seeing how wars and migration evolve as my group becomes more experienced with the game.

It's a curious game, one that suggests it is lots of things, including some you really want it to be, as it all feels so similar, and sounds so good. A lot of it is. But like the board, just when you think it is starting to look real good, it turns out to be a subtly different beast when you look again.

Whatever you do, make sure the rules are clear before you start play. Keep a turn overview available, and make it obvious what actions come at which cost. This game is very simple, but a muddled explanation will keep things unclear for far too long, and you'll be grabbing the rulebook over and over again just to check "you got that right". 

Whoever pulls out the game will quickly compare it to [gameid=822], but apart from tile-placement, I'm not too sure why. Unless people simply add up the familiarity of the draw-and-fit mechanism (here it always fits) to their perception of what kind of gameplay (or gamers) it is aiming for. When the first 2 continents get joined, echoes [gameid=42] will ring in your ears, but that is hardly the only game where a tile that joins 2 areas triggers a conflict resolution and it does very different things in this game. It uses a share/investment mechanism, private scoring rounds, has a randomized scoring and game end trigger, you take out shares in a civilization, rather than control it ([gameid=827]?)... everything has been done before, yet not quite the rich way it has been brought together here.

It is a game I would like to love. There is a lot condensed into a quick playing, but meatier game, and on the surface it seems to have all the hallmarks of one that will play very differently in each sitting, requiring a different game plan each time. Alas, I suspect it is also the sort of game where the 2 or 3 people in real contention will marvel at the options on offer, but the poor sod who is struggling too often faces a catch-22: points tend to gravitate towards a controlling continent, and to stop the leader(s) from running away with it, the controlling terrain needs to be split, but the only way to do that is by sacrificing their own chances to win by foregoing invaluable cube pick-ups that increases future scoring.

When one player has 3 or more cubes in one civilization that is no problem, as they won't be able to stop being picked upon. But with 5 cubes in play, chances are that there are two people in solid control of an ever increasing slice with 2 cubes each, as they equally benefit from co-operation. Whereas the other two don't share this parity, making the person with one cube less likely to do the legwork necessary to regain a scoring balance, resulting in the player in the worst position with the task to make the worst-scoring moves. I don't like that in a game, not even when I'm winning.

When people don't co-operate to slice a controlling terrain up, it's do easy for the controllers to undo what was done in the turns that follow. Tile replacement should always come at a cost, but here it only does it when it triggers 

It can be quite confusing to figure out what your goal is, but the moment it twigs that this game is all about bells, and less about the whistles, you can start to follow a genuine strategy. Pyramid score and Temple scores are nice, but pyramids score too low over the course of a game to concentrate on them, and you can't plan for a temple pick-up, so its best to ignore them and just deal with them when they become part of your hand tiles. No multipliers for temples anyway. Bells on the other hand..

On top, the fairly unrestricted tile placement and replacement rules make the board a very fluid environment. So fluid that meaningful forward planning is no real option. Maybe [i]all[/i] replacements should come at a cost, or changes made should be harder to be done.

The natural flow seems so stimulate the emergence of an ueber-Pangea: one substantially bigger continent that has more and more landmass with points gravitating towards it, mainly shared between two players, and that can only be broken by co-operation between at least 2 other people. It then in all likelihood still needs a follow-up move by a 3rd player to stop it from being undone right away. With these super continents in existence, whoever is lucky enough to get a disproportionate amount of the temples from their draws will be come very hard to beat (getting temples into completed, but valuable terrain is too cheap an option). The pyramids, which might give a better incentive to muck about with the layout for all players, if only they were worth something that mattered, and you had a reasonable chance of hanging on to for at least one more scoring round, are either too low-scoring, or too rare. The 3 bell-rounds again favour the strong, to a point.

Despite all that, I still enjoy playing it, but simply accept that every now and then I'll be the sod whose fate it is to  spend a game watching other people enjoy themselves. Right now it is "just" fast and pretty entertaining, There are some nifty things to be done in your turn, it keeps showing flashes of being something special, and then it bogs down again. I've got a nagging feeling that a few small tweaks could have fixed this into a real classic.

Surprisingly good game, and thus a great bargain for the price.  It is definitely more than a little like Carcassone plus attitude; very replayable and much more depth to it than I first suspected.  It is an excellent game.  The only thing I don't like as much (but don't really mind) are the Epoch tiles, which are kind of like Ra tiles in Ra---they come up randomly and yield points.  And can end the game premuaturely, though it's not likely that the game will end too prematurely.Perhaps something can be done to add Epoch tiles gradually to the stock piles, but it's likely not worth the trouble; the game is just fine.

Very good little game.

Why people don't talk about this game anymore is beyond me.

Also, I don't get the critique regarding the game potentially ending too soon due to epoch tiles. That's actually one interesting aspect of the game! If 4 epoch tiles have already been drawn, and everybody still have their scoring chips you'll probably see a "scoring rush". On the other hand, if epoch tiles aren't drawn immediately, there's more careful planning involved (although in this game it's quite difficult), etc.
This has also an effect on how the continents are built.

The rulebook is quite bad. It's clear enough, but once your start playing, you see that there are too many details that have been left out.

Interesting tile laying game where all the gods are trying to score points for civilizations they have influence in. The theme is a bit far fetched but the gameplay is pretty original. It can be chaotic with inexperienced players but when you've played the game more often you'll notice some patterns and realize timing is everything in this game. You have to time your scoring rounds and your temple scores perfectly to make the most of them. Besides that you have to cope with the random Epoch scoring rounds and keep an eye on the game ending conditions. All in all a low complexity game that offers interesting decisions and great opportunities for messing with you opponents. Great fun!

The game has a few okay elements and mechanics.  It has some similarities to Carcassonne and Acquire.

A stock-holding/speculation and tactical tile placement game that I find dull and tedious.  It involves too much "take that" for my liking because that's the way to wipe out your opponent's stock (cubes) and increase the value of your stock cubes.  Although it's largely a game of opportunity and timing, players need to work together to keep everyone in check.  It's not terrible, but I'm not find of this type of game that has high confrontation, little buildup and so much "take that"/opportunistic gameplay.

1 play (2p) - this is a very nasty 2p game.  We kept replacing tiles, so the board didn't grow very large.  I suspect it is a much better game with more players, where you have incentive to cooperate.  With 2, it's a desperate scramble to get points and then end the game.

Initial rating (6.5) based on one play (4 player) at BGG.CON 06.  Interesting game, but may end up being too chaotic for my taste.

You can actually plan a couple of moves ahead and not have the entire board be different by the time your turn rolls around again!

Wow, who decided to inflict this on the poor unsuspecting gaming population ? Seldom do I give a game a 1 but this game involves my most hated mechanism: dynamic and changing map/tiles. There is nothing worse than playing on a map, trying to plan something out when the landscape can change at any moment and someone else can just screw you over like quicksand cos they can. As a result any planning, skill or board control goes out the window. The small tiles, pieces are irritating and the game itself is a boring, painful APer's paradise exercise in Tetris style futility - with the threat of the rug being pulled from under your feet at any moment. There is little or no game here and the whole experience feels arbitrary.

I really enjoyed Gheos a lot. There are some tough choices to make as far as whether to leave the civilizations in which you're most heavily invested vulnerable to war or migration and try to get more points elsewhere, or to try to bolster them with more cups and swords. The press-your-luck aspect of choosing whether or not to score on any given round can lead to regret for missed opportunities, especially if a lot of Epoch tiles are drawn in a row and the game suddenly ends with your having foregone several scoring opportunities. The luck of the draw is just enough to make Gheos a family game rather than a war game, and the short learning and playing time strengthen that position. The fact that it's a tile game makes it fertile ground for future expansions, and I hope there are some. A couple of minor niggles -- the backs of the tiles were left plain white, and they could have been given some artwork. Stacks of white triangles all over the table didn't get in the way, but neither did they inspire. Even better, an opaque bag would greatly speed up set-up time, and I will almost certainly add one to my box. Altogether, I think Gheos is a strong SdJ contender, and I look forward to playing it more.

RATING: 3
A lot of problems with this one from my perspective. The theme is paper-thin. The triangular tiles are unusual, but the very restrictive layout format (all three corners are always water, all three edges are always land) makes for very little variation amongst tiles, and you're just hoping to pick one with points on it. The ability to place on any other tile at any time makes the game fluid to the point that it fails to cohere.

The civilization-building thematic elements are an interesting idea, but ultimately the theme is too weak and too shallow to engage, and the gameplay is weaker than Carcassonne or Taluva, while Gheos is arguably more complex than either.

I think it was an interesting concept, but the execution just isn't quite there, and there are too many good, similar competing games.

Another minor point, Gheos just isn't that visually interesting, which is a problem for a game of this sort. The original Carcassonne didn't do a lot for me, and it's visual blandness wasn't helping. Carcassonne: Hunters & Gatherers was much more pleasing game in this respect, and I liked it a lot more (it helped that it was a much better game as well, of course). Compared to two other recent tile-laying games that I liked, Bison and Taluva, Gheos is fairly bland.

Not a bad game.  A tile-laying mechanic that uses triangles instead of squares.  I also like the use of the cubes.  Causing "wars" between neighboring continents can result in some interesting conundrums, and this game forces you to consider your actions now vs. 3 or 4 plays from now.  Overall, a well done game.

There is a lot not to like about this. In the first instance it feels incredibly similar to Carcasonne, and frankly if you wanted to play Carcasonne then you would. In the second instance it is difficult to get a grasp of. The logic takes a lot to grasp, and having grasped it, its still not particularly satisfying. Fiddly, combative and intricate, this just isn't my cup of tea. A clever idea that just didn't work.

RATING: 6
A moderately enjoyable exercise in controlled chaos. My first game seemed very aggressive with rarely more than two civs on the board at any one time. Scoring was anemic as a result of the aggression, and the shifting landscape in combination with the scoring epochs made for a bit too much randomness for my taste. Having more than one cube in a color made that color a target. Having three was the kiss of death for the civ. I have a feeling that played by more experienced players, there might be a bit more here. I’m very willing to explore it, but it’s not at the top of my list.

7 plays (6x4p, different people, 1x3p) - continues to grow.  My rating could rise. It appeals to me in some of the same ways "Ur" does, although the mechanisms are quite different. Both have an abstract look a civilizations.  Both are tile laying.  Both are maybe medium weight.  Both don't take very long to play, usually. Gheos in part the shared scoring feel of competitive teamwork, which Ur doesn't have. Ur has very little luck, however (just set-up and turn order of first play). Here, the luck factor (tile draw, Epoch timing) seems appropriate for a fast playing stock scoring game with possibilities for aggression. I've seen it bring out the fangs in sweat-pea types as well as the doe-eyed.  The mechanisms of Gheos work together in novel ways with a lot of collectively manipulative possibilities that I'm just beginning to figure out. Some people I've played it have commented that they're not visual thinkers, but I think I may be (not saying that it means I win, but I like thinking the game's way).  Good with 3 or 4p.  Note to self, remember: when starting new civ, count the wheat in that continent, you earn that many people cubes.  It's an important rule that folks overlook!

Waring and migrating add an element that does not necessarily exist in most other tile laying games.  I like the option of replacing tiles after they've been placed.  This game is one that can easily become angry and over confrontational.

The intrinsic chaos in the game's design undermines any sense of fulfillment one might derive from strategic planning. Too much of the game depends on "screwing your neighbor" and, in this respect, Gheos feels like an Ameritrash game and suffers from the typical problem that games of this type tend to suffer from: namely, the person who gets "picked on" the least - not necessarily the person who plans the best - tends to win. I won the only game of this I've played but I really didn't enjoy the game very much and I don't plan on playing it again.

Like Dungeon Twister, I love to hate this game because there's something about it I just don't grok.  I know the rules, I know the goals and yet time and again RnR crushes my followers.  It isn't much like Carcassone except that there are tiles but I think of it as a mean version of Carc.

This is a tile laying game very much in the flavor of Carcassonne. Tiles have stuff on them that affects scoring, but instead of putting your own markers on them to mark ownership, you acquire followers in them. Each %u201Cfeature%u201D is a continent, and ownership shares are the followers. With T&E-style war and separation, there are some interesting decisions and flow throughout the game. I think this has the potential to play pretty quickly, which makes for a good light-to-medium game, even though some players said it didn%u2019t %u201Cfeel%u201D light. One reason is that scoring happens in two different ways. One when one of the eight scoring tiles is drawn (everyone scores), and one when a player plays one of their 3 scoring tokens (just that player scores), but how you get points in each method is completely different.

Carcassonne meets T&E, Less brain burn than T&E and more game-ish than Carc.  If you like T&T and you like Carcassonne you will like this game.  Playable and winnable by a 7yr old.

RATING: 5
Gheos is tough game to learn, and is complexity-wise certainly equal to Conquistador (El Caballero). It will definitely take a few games to grasp all details. A major stumbling block appears to be the rather busy graphical design and lots of 'A counts for B, C counts for D' graphics which are quite confusing. Once you have those nailed down, you can begin to explore the game. And then some annoying issues appear. For example, the ability to simply replace any tile whatsoever saps a lot of fun out of the game; the level of 'take that' can reach annoying proportions. At the same time, it's the only way to hold back your fellow players. In other words: if you dislike games like Babel and Hellas, you might want to think a bit before buying Gheos.

In the end I sold this game off, though. I really wanted to like Gheos, but every time I played it, I got this uneasy feeling that Gheos tries to be too much for its own good. Over time, my impressions of it being a good game waned and disappeared. The noticable amount of friction between me and the mechanics (the design and the take-that nature of the tile replacement) saw this game tumbling from 7 to 6, and when I realised I didn't want to play anymore because of the busy design, 5. I let it go to find a place where it would be looked after better.

Components: Nice-looking tiles. It definitely needs a draw bag.

Experience: Vicious vicious vicious. At first, everyone just founds and invests in their own civilization, but once all the civilizations are on the board, things get violent, with civilizations being forced to migrate at every play of the tile; invasions kicking civilizations from the continent, and huge swings in the worth of each civilization. It's very interesting to try to gauge the best moment to use my scoring tokens. This game is bizarre.

After two solo plays, I am quite enamoured with Gheos and I would like to play very soon. First play was justa bit of a wobbly read through the rules and an attempt to grok the strategy, but in the second play I could see numerous balancing factors come into play. I like the multiple dipping in the scoring method, my only problem is to find out how to pace the use of the scoring tokens. Pleased with my purchase overall.

-After a first game where I got creamed, I am still wanting to play again. Three first time players plus me completed the game in under an hour, so this can also be a work lunchtime game.

-Played a couple times since, and won and lost one each. Love the game. We are using an eight-pile seeding method, where we divide up the deck into eight piles and put an epoch tile into each, then draw stack by stack. Works great. We had two new players today and they got the rules just fine. I think it helps if you explain it as an investment banker game rather than a God game... though the original theme is undeniably cooler.

-Lost with 82 points to a player with 85. Played with a forbidden 5th player and the game played fine. Gheos is a really solid game with the placing aided by spreading out the Epoch cards. I think the ratio should be around 6 regular cards to 1 Epoch card when dealing in 8 Epoch cards. The ending is unexpected but not anticlimactic, it's intense, and no culture is sacred. If you invest too much in one culture (and you don't profit-take with your scoring token) you lose, plain and simple. Still an awesome game.

Tile laying game with Triangular tiles.  Easy to trash the leader.  With four players hard to set up play on board.  Board can change drastically between turns.

Play the best move for most points at any time.  Save scoring tiles for 10+ point plays.

Luck factor high of drawing wheat tiles early, cup tiles in middle game, and different merge / migrate tiles in the late game.

Players represent gods, building up a land, founding civilizations, and attracting followers.  On a turn, players play a triangular tile, forming up continents.  New civilizations can be formed on these continents, or players can take a follower (essentially a share in a civilization) for future scoring opportunities.  Scoring triggers based on certain tiles being drawn, other tiles being played, or when a player decides to hand in one of their "I score now" chips.  Lots going on in terms of scoring, but also rather restricted as you're playing from a hand of two tiles.  Still, fun, quick, and attractive to look at.

It is the elegent little civ-like little tile game, yes. The straightforward sequence of play keeps it moving along quicky, and the various ways that food, temples, wealth, and other resouces work are pure genius! But in my trial play we sure seemed to quickly merge and un-merge the same areas again and again, which is a lot of fuss for just doing and un-doing each other moves repeatedly.

This is a fun tile laying game.  I like having a hand of tiles to choose from rather than just taking one tile and laying it.  Choice is good.  In Gheos not only do you lay adjacent to tiles but you also have the option to lay on top of other tiles which replace them if you don't like the current land mass.  This can sometimes cause civilizations to migrate and go to war.  You also wonder how long the game is going to last much like drawing Ra tiles in the auction game Ra.  There are various ways to score in the game: tiles that take the game closer to the finale cause scoring of temples, tiles that when laid will give you VP based on one of three different circular icons,  three scoring markings that you can optionally play on your turn, and end of game scoring.  It's a pretty easy game to learn and best of all, it's fun.

Very nice little game where you collect followers of numerous different civilisations and score differing amount of points dependent upon the resources of the landmass the civilisation is on. 

Forcing opponent’s civilisations to migrate or go to war adds a nice interactive element to this game although it is very difficult to get back into the game if you have several civilisations wipe out in quick succession.

Gheos is a very enjoyable tile-placement game that is good to break up rounds of Carcassonne.  It gets really cutthroat by the end. Every move becomes one to deprive your opponent from their growing continents.  Although I sometimes lost track of the scoring rituals, there is enough going on in this game to make you feel engaged and tactical. But it is a mean game and players might just have to expect that lack of control in this game. That typically wouldn't be my style, but I like Gheos for what it does. Even though it has most of the problems of a unironed Euro, all of those things are manageable and part of the game. You just gotta keep your head in the game. Sadly, this game is best with 3. It's a little chaotic with 4 and not interesting enough with 2.

Very chaotic, which is not really a good thing. I do like the "most swords wins", "migrate to most wheat" and "points for cups" - they make sense to me - but I'd like the game to be a bit more stable so players could take pride in the might of their civilisation.

RATING: 6
A rather unexpected surprise here.  This game offers a lot of decisions in a rather short time.  I agree that there are better tile draws than others, but unlike some BGGers I think it all comes down to what you make of what you possess.  The luck factor is there, but by being able to stake claim in any civilization, the stock management, plus the ability to constantly recreate land masses reduces that a lot.  Yes, it's a little chaotic in that long term strategies won't stand, but for me the constant shift in board position and influence offers a fresh experience.  Timing is essential, I think people who complain about the randomness haven't taken into account that sometimes just getting some much needed points, be it one or two, is better than twiddling thumbs until some uber scoring opportunity will arise (which more often than not won't).  Gheos keeps players on their toes by choosing  tactical play over any semblance of long term strategy.  Don't get me wrong their are strategies, as there are many opportunities for some great plays.

Only ever played this with 2 players. Not sure if my rate will change up or down with more as the board would get a lot more chaotic with more players. A solid mixture of luck (tile draw), strategy (placement chosen from 3 tiles), and point maximizing yourself (growing colonies) or hurting your opponent (causing wars and migrations).

Just when I thought I had seen it all in a Carcassonnesque(tm) tile laying game, Gheos comes along and smacks me.  It's aggressive, and interesting since you invest in the growth of some civilizations, or do your best to crush them.  Either way, you do not have your own pieces.  You just play and do what you can trigger scoring in your favor before the game comes to an unexpected end.  Great game.

I like how you can change the configuration of continents and islands, but I thought it was perhaps too easy to replace a tile. You pay a small price only if you cause a war or migration. It works well for two players, but expect some chaos and possible kingmaking with more players. However, the biggest flaw is that the tiles that trigger the end are just shuffled with the rest, sometimes resulting in a very short and unsatisfying game. It should be like in "Gods" (which has the same theme), where the endgame tile is shuffled into a few at the bottom of the stack. Also, I think that the player's timing of the scoring tiles may actually add more randomness than the apparently intended control. With a little more development, the game might have deserved a rating of 9 or more. Anyway, it is quite enjoyable when it does not end prematurely.

dang it!  I broke my own rule about giving games fractional ratings, but I couldn't decide between 7 and 8.  i'm afraid 8 is a little over-inflated due to the newness.  played 2 back to back games with  same 4 players.  really like it.  i can see the comparison to T&E but not carcassonne.  i think it's lighter than t&e and not as deep, but need to play more to see. 

update: played again after a while and enjoyed it a lot (though I still suck!) though I think I'm going to have to settle on 7 because the way the epoch tiles can get be turned over in clumps, and too early in the game.  Also this game seemed to have a rich get richer problem.  The people trailing never could get enough cubes because they were busy causing war or migration.  then again, maybe I just suck!

You take the role as one of the gods that creates the world, how awesome is that is that!
You build the land start new civilisations and gain worshipper, and then you re-module the land and kill the civilisations that is worshipping the other players.
    
There is some strategy to this game and the mechanics works good.
Can seem a little abstract.

Fun game, not too heavy at all. Once you get all the different scoring opportunities straight it is pretty quick. Tricky too. Focus too much on one civilization and you will probably lose. Spread yourself too thin, and you'll probably lose too! I think the sweet spot in a 4 player game is to be invested in 2-3 civilizations. Sometimes you'll want to focus heavily on two, sometimes, you'll want to dilute a bit and throw in a 3rd. Any more than that and you start losing the benefit of the score multiplier effect of haing 2-3 followers in one civ. Wars and migrations add an interesting element of unpredictability that can screw up a score scoring machine. Also, I like the scoring chip system where you decide when to take some extra points. Use them up too early and you won't get much in terms of points. Wait too long though and you may get caught with unused chips when the last Epoch marker is drawn. Too bad so sad.

RATING: 6.5
I had very high expectations, but was disappointed, sadly. I really like the theme, the art, the idea, but there´s too much luck and if players work as a team, it kills the game completely.

It works much better as a 2 player game, but the luck of the draw is still important. A 2 player is very aggressive, as you can't let your opponent get ahead much, if you want to have a chance. It's back and forth all the time and it's all about the timing of your scoring tiles.

Played this once.  The theme was good, the rules were pretty simple, but the fact that you can replace tiles that are already on the board makes this game chaotic and annoying.  You can get rid of a player's big civilization too easily this way.  Perhaps this just means that you have to play much more defensively... I probably should play this again with different numbers of players to form a better opinion, but there are so many better games to spend my time on!

This game is tense, but in a much more subtle manner than I anticipated: it very much shows its lineage as an economic inspired game. I'm under the impression that when this game is played as an economic game rather than (or in addition to) a Carcassone-esque type tile-placement game is when this shines. More plays will tell.

[Initial Impression: 5]
This tile-laying game is themed around gods creating land masses and the rise and fall of new civilations upon those lands. It has features that carry a high potential to be really interesting - unfortunately, the way that they combine makes for a game that often seems a repetitive bout of tit-for-tat. 1)Not only can you place a tile on your turn, but you can remove and replace an existing tile - this often causes "wars" and "migrations" that alter the shape or existence of civilizations. 2)No one player controls a single civilization, so everyone can have a shared stake in multiple places on the board. 3)There are multiple ways to score (temples, pyramids, and cups), which means there is quite a lot to keep track of in what is an otherwise straight-forward rules set. It can often be better to replace a tile, pay the cost, and destroy or neutralize a civilization that will score big points for your opponent than to add to a civilization that you mostly control. In practice, and particularly in two-player games, once one player replaces a tile that hurts one civilization, the other player replaces the same tile, and so on until someone comes up with a clever way to break the circle (or has no tiles to do so). This tends to keep the board small and feeling undeveloped.  Also, players often destroy civilizations if another player has even a slight majority control of that civilization, meaning that there is a constant turn-over of civilizations, again leading to an undeveloped feeling.  It might be possible to overcome these drawbacks with certain play styles, or perhaps better, either a restriction on the number of tile replacements each player is allowed per game or a restriction on replacing tiles that were just placed in the current round. Overall, I want to like this game more, but it makes me seasick from all the back-and-forth movement.

A great and mean tile laying civilization building game loosely based on my favorite theme, mythology. It is a solid game with an in-depth strategy where timing and planning are everything. Some quick math skills would be good too. 

This game has the most well written rules. Simple to follow with pictures and thorough explanations.

Another abstract civilization building game. The tiles you draw are VERY similar giving the gameplay a montonous feel, and you score for pyramids when an epoch tile is drawn even though there are very few pyramids and they may not appear until late. It's hard to dislodge a powerful civilization, especially with fewer players, giving 'shares' in that colour a disproportionate value. Another game that doesn't quite do it for me.

A strange little stock game with very volatile commodities.  You can gather a lot of cubes, but the corresponding civilization might be gone tomorrow.  Not good with two as there is little opportunity for multiple competing civilizations to arise. I think I'd like it better if I had a better idea of when it's worth it to spend a cube to make things happen.  They seem like valuable commodities, but since they can disappear at any moment, I should probably be more willing to spend them... (3 plays)

RATING: 7
First played April 2nd, 2008. Taught in 10min, played in 45min(depending on tiles) for 4 players. This has good luck/strategy ratio. Triangle land tiles are mixed together with scoring tiles. Each have water in the corners and land in different configurations. One or two tiles surrounded by water are islands, 3 or more are continents. Tiles have pyramids(each follower gets 1VP for each during epoch), temples(VPs for each type of symbol on continent you placed tile), wheat(rewards 1 follower for each when placing a settlement), swords(when merging continents decides which settlement stays), cups(each follower gets 1VP for each on continent during scoring) symbols on them. Players draw from the stacks and place around the start tile. On your turn you place a tile. It can be connected to a tile or replace a tile on the board. If you choose replace and it causes a merge of settlements you give up one of your followers for the action and remove the settlement type. Dividing continents allows new settlements to be placed. After tile placment, you may place a settlement or take one follower and optionally score(limit 3 during game). Game ends when all epochs are drawn or everyone uses their scoring chips, then a final scoring round begins. Recommed purchase and consideration in play rotation.

RATING: 7
A fun game that I have played with 2 & 3 players.  If somebody gets way behind on VPs it is hard to catch up.  The games play quick (about 1/2 hour) so if you have a bad game you will be able to start a new game shortly.  The lead can change quickly by clever replacement of tiles, however.

Gheos is basically evil Carcassonne.  While I like the design, I think the game should be a bit longer.  Things seemed to end when everything started to get interesting.  In addition, the tile draw and hand size somehow felt even more luck based than Carc.  I like the migration and wars mechanic, but the short game length and luck of draw sour it quite a bit for me.  It's just OK in all regards.

RATING: 6.9
Highest initial rating ever for me.  I'd read up on it a lot, and it amazingly played about like I expected it to.  It can be nasty, but as long as you don't invest in one "stock" too heavily, then it can be very difficult to take heavy losses.

Has tile laying and countryside building of Carcassonne.
Civilization fighting of T&E.
Stock investing of Acquire
& Push-your-luck game ending of Ra

6 Plays later it's still a 9.  It's less evil with more players, and there's lots of chaos that stops long term planning, and there's potential for AP, *BUT* it's still lotsa fun and I want to play again!

Jan 08: Dropped a little just because it's hard to teach to others.  I feel that there may be a few too many rules.  Why were temples included again?

Aug08: Gah.  Dropped again.  Just can't bring myself to get it to the table.  Not a good game with that in light.

An interesting game that relies on some familiar mechanics but which nevertheless manages to be original. I particularly like the triangular tiles and the limited number of follower cubes. Despite the simple rules, playing Gheos requires some thought as a clever move can improve your score considerably. My main criticism is that the element of chance can be too significant, with the temples being particularly gratuitous. The result is a game focussed on taking advantage of opportunities as they arise, with only a small element of long-term planning.

Given that this is a draw a tile, play a tile type euro, it will naturally get comparisons to Carcassone.  However, our group plays that game like some form of group solitare -- not so Gheos.  There is real player interaction here, and a nice taste of "take that."  

One thing that Gheos has in spades is the "cool move" effect, where through the clever placement of a tile, you have a cascading effect that can greatly improve a player's circumstance.  Additionally, the scoring is very strategic and vital to good play of the game.  

It plays quickly and cleanly.  A fine design from Mr. Wiersma.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (December 2012)

I dreaded to play Gheos as a friend said to me that is was similar to Carcassonne, a game I (irrationally) detest. After a little arguing I conceded and we played this and I’m glad we did. 

First of all, the theme rocks, we are GODS, who would not like that :D, second, it has the “tile placement” mechanism but I don’t feel the game is similar to Carcassonne. In fact, this game has a surprising tactical depth (simple rules) that I found refreshing (and I want to buy the game), it has lots of tough decisions, lots of “take that” and it plays very fast. Best with 3 players, with 4 I feel luck can run the show. The components are adequate and the art is gorgeous. 

Still not everything is good, I’m concerned about the luck of the draw in the Epoch tiles, but as the game plays so fast, I’m not VERY concerned.

Bottom line, I like it and I would play it again. For me, this game has nothing in common with Carcassonne (except the main mechanic “Tile Placement” :P) and I feel Gheos is the superior game in every regard.

Current Rating: 7.0

It’s been a long time since I last played Gheos. I did recently and I still enjoy the game. However now I’m much more harsher with my ratings so Gheos is a 6.0 for me now. Still a good game that I plan to keep in my collection to play it from time to time, but perhaps I will get rid of it.

Just a little too much chaos and luck in this game for me.  I will give the game another try, but its one where I am glad that I resisted the initial hype and held off buying.  It seems you have to be darn lucky to get a tile to even begin to start/build a position and all that can be wiped out as soon as the next player takes their turn.  After my first play, I got the same feeling I had after my first couple playings of Gloria Mundi, and that's not a good thing for me.

An abstract tile laying game where players create continents and tribes to populate the world. There is a bit of nastiness to the tile-replacement which could potentially lead to AP late in the game, since players are allowed to remove any tile that has already been played.

I do not like abstract games. However, even I will play this one. Perhaps this is because it has many ways to score. Or perhaps the bright little tiles. Also, fortunately for me, the group I played it with did not suffer from analysis paralysis. However, I will warn you that the first game will probably be strictly a learning game, as the game is very fiddly. You place or replace triangular tiles. The icons on the tiles give you bonuses. At first it reminded me of carcasonne, but there is a LOT of conflict, so it turned out to be very different.

Being a god? Shape the Earth? Control the rise and fall of civilizations while trying to gather worshippers for your cult? Sing me up! While its mechanisms veer towards the abstract, they are thematic enough to capture said feeling.

Gheos is a game of pure tactics: you have a very clear goal from the beginning, what isn't so clear is how to obtain it. Every player can change the landscape with dramatic effects, so you must adapt your strategy almost each turn to the chaos which surrounds you. To add a bit more chaos to the mix, civilizations can be "controlled" by any the player, not only by the one who founded it.

The components are also very good and, though a bit luck driven, has the perfect length for a game of its weight.

I like this game.  Still not sure whether the "broken 2-player" claims are valid; it seems like, when things get to the point where one civilization has eaten all the others, and one player has 4 or 5 of that civ's followers, the other player can split that continent with wheat on one side and swords on the other, start a new civ on the swords side, and rejoin the continent on their next turn, wiping out the previously dominant civ.

Update: still only a couple of 4-player games, but I think it might be best with 3, as there's less down time.  And it's easier to get everyone else at the table muttering about what a bastard you are.  You can make some horribly mean moves in this game!

Update: it's bad-ass with 2.

Update: raising this from an 8 to a 10.  And it's not just because I usually win, really!

[2007.Jan.10] This game is surprisingly similar in some ways to Tigris & Euphrates; it could even be considered a sort of 'T&E lite'. The Z-Man Games edition is well produced and overall a quality game.

[2007.Mar.19] Although playable with 2-4 players, this game is best played with 3-players. With 2-players the game appears to be too dry and mechanical, heavily influenced by the "luck of the (tile) draw". With 4-players, the game is too chaotic as the surface of the tile built board changes drastically from turn-to-turn. {7}

I like some ideas in the game, especially the theme. I think the elements are there but simply badly implemented. The theme makes me think about the populous video game. But the game does not make me feal that I am god in anyway. Personally, I would have loved seeing follower on the map expanding their territories and fighting each other.

RATING: 7
A triangular tiles-playing game of starting, expanding & contracting civilizations on continents.  There are three venues to scoring:  temples, cups and pyramids.  The end game trigger(s) is all about "timing", so choosing when to trigger your three personal scoring (cups) opportunities, BEFORE the final Epoch tile, is important.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game certainly has many more interesting decisions to make than Carcassonne but does have a problem at times with ending too quickly.  I found both war and migrating to be very interesting and a bit novel in a tile laying game where continents can become united quickly or turned into small, useless islands which wipe out civilizations.  Its definitely an aggressive game and not one where people who like to build their own country and consider it theirs would likely enjoy.

This is a fast paced strategy game that encourages conflict. Since you aren't building features per say, and you can take any color resource cube you wish when you build, added to the fact that you can build over almost any existing tile, makes this game different from any I have seen before. This is NOTHING LIKE CARCASSONNE!

Update: Another play and even more ways this game can play out. Tile luck is minimal as you have to gamble if what you've done will last another turn or whether to score now! Another interesting element is that you always have a stock of two tiles in front of you, so you can always hold onto a tile for the right moment. This is definately a quality game, but stay away if you don't enjoy conflict.

On another side bar, David Fair told me he had made 3o some odd points in one go, and I thought that was outrageous...until I scored 42 in one shot!

Fun, fast,....oh yeah, and fun.

RATING: 6.5
An interesting game, will take another play (or a few) to decide how much I like it. Includes elements of other games like Carcassonne, Tigris and Euphrates, and Acquire, but comes together in a unique game. Downside was the luck of the tiles and at times sense of lack of control. (The end of game condition variability can worsen this, but I've not seen a problem with that yet). I'll try it again...

[Played once]
Abstract tile-laying game.
Your opportunities seem to be too heavily based on what you draw (Carcassonne at least allows clever play to partially compensate luck).
It enables "take that" a bit too much.
The utterly random implementation of the "Epoch" scoring is simply bad.
Visually unsinspiring (the tiles look too similar, so the resulting landscape is unappealing).

RATING: 7
Rating based on one play, so could go up.  It's a fun little thinker that I enjoyed.  Generally there are a few good options to choose from on your turn.  If you're unlucky enough to have two "Epoch" tiles in your hand when it only benefits your opponents, then you have no options, you were just unlucky.  Besides that you usually have some choices to make.  We played with 4 players and the final scoring was: 103, 101, 99, and 98... so VERY close.  I want to try again now that I know the rules, and the outcomes of some of the moves you can make.

RATING: 4
Some interesting ideas, but it seems a little too random and chaotic for me.

My second play was totally miserable for everyone involved.  All but one of the epoch tiles got drawn early, before anyone had even drawn a pyramid to play.  I had several turns where I couldn't do anything constructive and I was forced to place tiles that just let the next player start nice civs.  Not fun at all.  My rating went down.

2 plays, 3 players.

I originally saw this game played at a friends house when he hosted a game day and thought it looked interesting.

Bought 2007-01-09 @ Milsims, $40. Rating based on 1 play to date, with 2 players. This is NOT a type of game that I am good at - Fraser is always going to beat me 2p. Should play very differently with more than 2, however. The 'formed continents' concept reminds me somewhat of Sunda to Sahul.

Update - have now played several times, including with 4. This is a very fluid & dynamic game - the challenge is very much in seizing the moment and picking when to score. It's very dry, but becomes less so after a couple of plays.

I like it just fine. There's nothing specifically bad about it. It's a bit too confrontational of a game to play with my wife, and it has more factors to consider than other similar games, leading to slower play. But I like the way you can make civilizations rise and fall. I do wish there were fewer things to remember in the game, though (for instance, temples could probably not be included and the game would still work fine).

Overall feel is pretty random; you don't know what tiles your opponent have in their hands, you don't know when scoring will be triggered, and any tile on the board can be replaced and have drastic effect on the layout. I found that there were too many civilizations, making it difficult to "invest" in the right one, and overall not enough control over the eventual outcome. A nice light game for the family, but no more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Chaos? Not that much as they say. You can  predict what is going to happen with the civilization, and try to score when its downfall is iminent. Of course the other 3 players can, when you are in the lead, screw the game before it's your turn again. It plays a lot like T&E, and the tension caused by the Epochs is interesting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Pretty decent. Nothing like Carcassonne at all. T&E is a good comp. Another good example of cutting down the impact of luck by keeping the species of tile to a minimum. Quick and clean, maybe a little chaotic for a civ game - it's pretty easy to mess things up - but then again it doesn't take three hours, which is a reasonable trade-off.

We had a problem playing this with two players. It seemed like your most advantageous move was frequently to totally destroy your opponent's civilizations. This meant that out of all the civilizations on the board at one time, likely none would be left at a later time. So what was the advantage of trying to make your civilization succeed? What difference did the early turns make?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A decent game - offering extremely balanced choices in deciding between developing continents with wheat, cups or swords. Great fun to ruin your opponents plans, and maddening when they do the same to you. Unfortunately, I am not really a fan of how the game ends - either by running out of scoring cards, or by drawing 6 epoch cards. Both seem anti-climactic.

If there's one game I've gotten rid of that I might actually regret in the near future, it's this one.  Every time I thought about its chances of getting played, it would take one step closer to the "sell" pile.  But oddly, whenever I actually did give it a chance, I quite liked it.  It's deliciously tense and full of screwage, with lots of "ah ha" and "gotcha" moments.  Ultimately, though, I didn't think it had the staying power against the wave that is "The Cult of the New."  I may be proven wrong...

This game is quite fun and offers a variety of strategies in amost any situation... I was expecting a Carcassone-ish play but it's hardly like Carcassone at all except fot the fact that you lay down tiles.  The shared civilizations is a bit tricky to wrap your head around at first but once you get into a game it becomes second nature.  The excellent rules covered any questions that came up regarding gameplay.  Interesting how the merging and splitting of continents causes mighty societies to rise and fall.  This one will see a lot of play from my group.

Very appealing in terms of gameplay, graphics, and theme.  Two concerns:  a player whose favored civilizations are constantly being weakened or wiped out by disruptive (as opposed to competitive) players may never have the cubes to properly retaliate, and the game can end far too abruptly due to the Epoch tiles.  If the first player technically wins because he pulls X of those things in a row after his very first turn, the fact that everyone knows it's BS doesn't change the fact that it's BS.  Oh yeah, and I'm liable to get in trouble for yelling at people who say Gheos is like Carcassonne, because it SO isn't.

I'll try and stay mostly positive the next time I rate a game an 8.

RATING: 7
I really like this one with any number of players. It gets more strategic with 2 or 3, but it's also fun to have 4 people doing their best to outmaneuver each other on an ever changing landscape. The game can be a little problematic if the scoring tiles come out too clustered or too quickly but that only happens very rarely and the game is quick enough to overcome this issue.

Little game that taxes your brain and has the potential of being nasty, no, it begs for you to be as nasty as you can. War, I say!

Updated:  Sadly, though the nastiness is enticing, with the back-to-back vengeful and spiteful moves, the game aesthetically is lacking and is a bit fiddly when it concerns substitution of tiles and what happens when continents are split etc.  There's a lot to keep track of for a game that should be simple.

This game has a decidedly Acquire feel to it. You are trying to take advantage of the splitting and merging of island groups. Depending on the symbols on the tiles, you score points or gain followers. Followers can then be used to merge or split islands later. Being able to split an island, start a new civ and get several followers out of the deal is a good strategy.

Well, I did the graphic design for this game so I am just a weeee bit biased, but I think the game itself is great.  René did a beautiful job of balancing several mechanics to form a unified whole.  I love that most of the "action" in the game is the result of civilizations' pre-programmed behaviour responding to tile-placement by the godlike players... it's an agonizing experience when a civ (that you have many followers of) migrates cheerfully to its own doom, but it's also very satisfying to lay the tile that forces someone else into the same situation.  Many many tactical approaches to getting ahead/dragging others down available, and more tricks become apparent to me all the time.  Great game.  I'd love it even if I hadn't been involved in the production.

This game is a tile laying game but is also a Civ building game.  The good part is that every player (2-4) is trying to build up the same civilizations on the map (up to 6).  The game end conditions are variable (depends on scoring tiles that are drawn).  The winning player is usually the one that makes best use of his 3 scoring markers (separate from the normal game scoring periods).  Its also pretty fast paced (2 players can finish in about 30 minutes) and not really subject to analysis paralysis.

RATING: 7
Only the one 2 player game thus far, and it will clearly benefit from more plays. It took well over half the game to figure out what on earth I was trying to do, and my opponent didn't quite get there at all. It seems like a clever little game of optimising the best time to "cash in" your scoring chips, as these appear to undoubtedly hold the key to victory. The epoch tiles serve more as an end game mechanic than anything else. - Secret Santa 2007

RATING: 5
Well-designed game of triangular tile-laying plus a form of stock ownership. It uses mechanics I don't happen to enjoy. Probably best played super-cutthroat.

The fact that you choose when to score yourself 3 times per game is great. The fact that you score per "share" of each civilization you own (rather than based on majorities like most stock games) is great. I like that any tile can legally be played almost anywhere. I like that you have to pay a penalty to cause a war or migration. I like that it can play quickly (35-60 minutes) but see below.

If you play seriously, there is going to be some risk of AP and brain burn. You have about 30 choices of which tile to place where in which position, and then you have to consider the 30 options you are leaving for your opponent. I don't think you can look out farther than that, except with some vague plans about which civs you hope to grow and which you hope to kill.

I think the rules weight is 2.0, and the depth is probably 2.5.

You need to keep track of a few of the icons in order to be able to plan properly. Make sure to play over tiles and fight a lot (migration and war), since this makes the game more fun. After several plays, I like it a lot, just make sure you can properly explain it.

I thought it was really cool how you could sculpt the landscape to cause civilizations to grow, shrink, and conflict with one another.  It's essentially a stock game, but I was able to conjure up some great visual imagery with it.  Having to give up a follower cube to drastically alter the landscape can be an agonizing decision at times.

Not very good with two.

2 plays.  Excellent game.  Reminds me of 3rd-person Carcassonne, with more self-determination.  Not as much chance to be screwed by 1 terrible draw as you can always change the landscape.  Can't run away with the game either - can always be toppled.

Rather chaotic game, and the strategy is a bit hard to grasp, but still a lot of fun. Takes a while to learn, but high on tactics and low on long-term strategy, which is why I like it. The high amount of randomness makes some games more satisfying than others. Can be a bit of a brain burner.

This is a game I really really wanted to like.  I love the overall concept, the style, and some of the mrchanics in the game play.  Unfortunately it just doesn't quite come together.  The game just has to much chaos with both the easy wild swings in the civilizations, and in the way the epoch tiles come out.  Also the various way of scoring VPs all feel very divorced from each other, and unbalanced.  In the end the game just feels disjointed and unfulfilling to play IMO.  I think the most frustrating part is that it seems so very close to being a really good game. I think if someone were to do some serious tweaking to the rules and set up of the game you could really come up with something.

RATING: 9
Hellishly fun and addictive, but short.

One way we found to expand and make the game more confrontational was that replaced tiles would be thrown back into the pot to be drawn again.  This causes much more fighting over resource-temples.

RATING: 7
Not a bad game but the luck plays a key role in the game. Since the scoring is determined by the epoch tiles that are drawned randomly after the placement on the board, it tend to favorise the player who drew the tile. The land tiles are also drawned randomly making the luck factor even greater. Still it's a dynamic game where there is a high dose of ''take that''. I bought this game because I was tired of playing Carcassonne with my girlfriend. But the ''take that'' factor is to great to even think playing this game with my girlfriend. The materiel is almost without reproche except fot the tiles that would have looked better if there were graphics on the back instead being white.

Pas un mauvais jeu mais le facteur chance joue un rôle important. Comme les décomptes sont déterminés par la pige aléatoire des tuiles d'époque, ceci a tendance à favoriser celui qui pige la tuile. La pige des tuiles de terre est aussi un facteur aléatoire augmentant l'aspect chance. Ghéos reste un jeux dynamique ou les ''prend ça'' sont fréquents. J'avais acheté ce jeu afin de jouer avec ma conjointe, mais le facteur ''prend ça'' est trop élevé pour que je puisse penser y jouer avec ma conjointe. Le matériel serait sans reproche si ce n'est que l'endos des tuiles aurait pu avoir un motif au lieu d'être blanc.

Pros:
* Wild, swingy moves (like Babel). I'm listing this as a pro, but not everyone likes that.
* Feels like you're actually doing something when you place a tile.
* Fairly simple rules and gameplay.
* Vicious take-that play without feeling picked on (I'll again liken this to Babel).
* Highly interactive. There's even some room for bluffing and, if you allow it, negotiation.
* Enough luck to keep things interesting, but not so much to feel frustrating.

Cons:
* The board can get knocked around a bit when you replace a surrounded tile. Hive has this same issue.
* Despite the simple rules, there are enough details and special cases to require careful reading.
* A fair bit of counting.
* If you like long term planning, don't even consider this game.
* If you like to be left alone to build in peace, go back to your Feld games.

Neutral:
* As is often the case with mathy games, this would not be fun with AP prone players.
* Would have preferred a scoring track instead of VP tokens. There are lots of moves that make less than 5 points so you collect 1-VP tokens and then find yourself trading them back in fairly often. Will likely use a cribbage board in the future.
* I've only played twice, but in both games we drew two Epochs in a row. If this bothers you, there are plenty of ways to house-rule around it.
* The state of the game can change dramatically between turns.

Played our first game of this tonight. We missed a very important rule (taking followers == wheat when starting a new civilization) but I still loved the game. A few more plays to get the rules down and get a feel for the various options and I could see this one easily going to 8 or better. Very vicious, but like Babel you never really feel like you've been set back too far even when someone completely decimates your civilization. Loved it.

Had a chance a couple weeks ago to play by the correct rules with a gamer friend. It had already been a week or two since I'd played by one and only game of this, but the rules were simple enough that I was able to explain them (correctly) almost without reference. With the correct rules, this great game was even better. Towards the end of our game, the scores were something like 80+ (me) to 50 (him) and it looked like there was nothing he could do about it, except I had used my last scoring token and he was down to his last. We quickly verified in the rules that when the game ends, you do one more scoring round for everyone. Having ceded to him the advantage of being able to control when the game ends, I also pointed out I'd left myself particularly vulnerable on my last move. He took advantage of my mistake and then tossed in his last scoring token for 20 points. We then did the final scoring for an additional 20 for him and only a few points for me. I think he ended up winning by 2 and we both loved the game.

A hybrid born as a step-child of Carcassonne and Tigris. After playing it once I felt a bit confused, but it has the potential. Not a game for every occasion, but if you are ready for some brain-burning, this can be a good choice! In this regard it resembles more to Tigris.

Gheos is an excellent game in its class. It is a fairly lightweight game that plays in under an hour. Somehow it always gets compared to other games, usually Carcassonne, although it's really not like Carcassonne at all. My son described it as "Tigris and Euphrates Lite" but if I had to choose, I'd say it's most like El Caballero. But Gheos is its own game, different from any other. The rules are simple and elegant, and the rulebook is well written and illustrated. Gheos is fun, and we look forward to more plays.

After a couple of 2-player games, I'd say it's playable with two but definitely better with 3!

Still interested in playing some more.

Supposedly a mix of Tigris and Euphrates (which I like) and Carcassonne (which I sort of like). Seems like a win-win situation, but it really has to shine on some new, third axis for me to seriously consider buying the game.

--Feb2007-- Quite a fascinating experience.  I'd expected something that felt more like a standard area-majority game than it turned out to be.  As it is, there's a good deal more volatility to the scoring than I had anticipated, so the randomness of the end-game draw is a significant factor in the final tally.  For the moment, though, it's good fun.  I'll be interested to see whether I'm still itching to play in 2009.

I finally got to play a game before it was "cool!" I playtested this back when Rene first designed it. It was about as good then as it will be now - as the final version is almost identical to the one I tested.

This game is said to be a sort of cross between Carcassonne and Tigris & Euphrates. That's definitly a valid comparison, but if you're making the comparison then you should compare the game more to T&E than to carc... this is not a simple, light game! The only similarity to Carc is that you're placing tiles to create the board, and sometimes you put dudes on the tiles. the similarity to T&E is mostly the war mechanism, which resembles External conflict from T&E. So really, Gheos is it's own game. If anything, it's more like a stock market game, as players gain interest in the different civilizations, and those civs are worth more or less over the course of the game. When you think your situation is 'good enough,' you cash in a scoring chip and take the points.

Gheos is very clever, and very original, even if some of the mechanics (Tile laying, stock, etc) have been seen before. I mean, there aren't a lot of mechanics that [i]haven't[/i] been seen before.

Gheos --

Played three-player once.

After reading the rules, I expected this to be a brain-burner, and to be rather nasty.  In fact that was largely why I avoided playing it for so long.

In our first play, nastiness was never an issue, and I expect that to generally be the case.  Gheos is about recognizing and seizing opportunities.  The method for doing so usually (almost always!) involves hurting your opponents, but it is because of precisely this that the game did not feel nasty -- when almost [i][b]every[/b][/i] tile played involves helping yourself at your opponents' expense, then almost [i][b]none[/b][/i] of the attacks feel personal. 

Rich is particularly good at this sort of game, and he hit me hard several times (with wars which cost me followers, and with migrations which reduced the value of my remaining followers).  But rather than feel put-out, I was engaged by how it was done, and how I could do something similar on my turn -- not out of vengeance, but simply because that's how the largest point spreads are achieved.

The ability to replace any tile (except pyramid tiles) with another is the heart of the game.  Of course this also makes the game overwhelmingly calculational.  I've repeatedly seen the game described as "chaotic".  I think that's too strong a word, but it [i]is[/i] difficult to plan ahead when the landscape may change dramatically by your next turn.  Also, the temples seemed too powerful considering the randomness of their acquisition.

We got two rules wrong:
•In addition to ending when the nth Epoch tile is drawn (which we [i][b]did[/b][/i] know), the game also ends when all players have played all their Chalice tokens (which we didn't know).
•A tile containing a pyramid can never be replaced.

These are rather important rules, and furthermore, they seem appropriate.  

And regarding my impression that it would be a brain-burner, it can indeed be too much, but since it is far more tactical than strategic, I found myself willing (even interested) to play again.  Since this is Rich's type of game, I'm happy that this is a game I can enjoy while he trounces me.  Though, I do think I'd prefer playing with more than two players.  With only two, I'd not only feel outclassed, I'd feel too targeted.  Best to divide the attacks among more players.

2008: 10. Very, very awesome game.  Every time I play I'm surprised at how balanced everything is, from 2 up to 4 players.  Takes a bit for new players to "get", but once they have it figured out, they almost immediate start playing like pros.  Lots of group dynamics going on here.  Great production values, colourful art and one of the best manuals I've seen, ever.  Top notch!

UPDATE 2014-02: 9. Have not played in a long time now, new purchases have taken up my attention, but still hold this game in high regard. Need to bring it out more.

UPDATE 2017: 8. Played again recently, and it still holds up pretty well.  There might be more modern competition though, in Cocoa (which I've played) or Isle of Skye (which I haven't), but I still like this one.

RATING: 6
A tile-laying game that tries to mirror the ebb and flow of continents and civilisations. Each turn, a player places a tile (which could trigger scoring), chooses to start a new civ or take a follower from a current civ (of which there are 5). A tile is then drawn to refresh their hand.

The interesting play comes in reshaping continents to trigger wars (think conflict in T&E) that wipe out another civ. There are also placements to trigger scoring of farmers and 'cups'. The scoring is done in a variety of ways and each one different to the other (confusion anyone?). Oh right, players also have three scoring tokens they can choose to use at the right time.

Ultimately, it's a decent midrange game that offers players some interesting decisions: do you try to build up your followers for more points or take them when you can. I'm not a fan of the graphics or the scoring system but it's not a bad game.

I really did not care for Gheos. The chaos-meter is way to high on this one for me, and that's in a 2 player game! More players makes it worse. As with many other tile laying games, you draw a tile and then place it - although in Gheos you have the option to cleverly remove some other tile and replace it with your draw. This effectively removes any attempts at planning on the part of your opponent - indeed, on the part of anyone, really. Gheos is almost a purely tactical game, and one wherein player fortunes can shift drastically from turn to turn. I just didn't find it fun or satisfying to play. The rules are more involved than Carcassonne, for instance, but do not deliver commensurate gameplay rewards.

RATING: 4
This is a rather chaotic game drenched heavily in luck. This is yet another game where most players are trying to manage the best they can with what tiles they draw.  If you draw tiles that enable you to score you will win the game, if you get other tiles you will futz around making life difficult for the leaders to do anything worthwhile until you get lucky enough to do something worthwhile.

Overall a very cleanly designed system but a frustrating experience.  There are a number of really clever moves that one can make, and it is rather cool to see how you can manipulate the playing area and how the continents change.  But, I felt that playing was entirely dependent on what tiles I drew.  More irritating is that turn order plays a key role in scoring, every turn matters and some players will not get the same number of turns as others.  Clever play just doesn't seem to make up for getting tthe tiles you need.

The epoch scoring is also irritating in that other players can continue to score points off of them while others have no chance to get in on it, if they never had the opportunity to be apart of a civ that connects.

I will certainly never play this again with four players, I might give it another shot with three to reduce the chaos and to increase the chance of drawing tiles that will eventually be useful, but with less players this could turn even more lobsided.

The first time I read about this game I was very intrigued, and I'm glad my gut-feeling paid off.

While some may have made comparisons to Carcassonne, Gheos isn't like it at all, besides laying down tiles next to each other.

It may look like very simple game at first glance, but it turns out to be much heftier strategy-wise, since one cannot just stick with one nation, and there is always the chance of another player upsetting the balance by reshaping the world.

A very good game!

Awesome little tile-laying game.  Neither difficult to learn nor (once you get the feel of it) long to play.  Combines simple tile-laying mechanics with good strategy elements, and a theme of omnipotence that does not feel 'pasted on'.  Some excellent features that add variety, interest and fun -  like three-fold scoring triggers (by tile placement, playing limited counters and random card-draws), unknown game-end timing, and the ability to achieve dramatic effects on other players by collapsing continents, instigating wars, and stuff like that!  What more could you want in a little box?

RATING: 7
A solid tile-laying, area-influence game. Plays in about 45 minutes but there's a lot going on, with some good decisions to make throughout.

Players are gods creating the world, which consists of land and sea areas (islands, continents), populating it with civilizations, gaining followers, building temples, etc; get points based on the importance of each civ. Most points wins.

Start the game with 2 tiles in hand, and Start Tile on the table in play. Turn sequence:
1. Play a tile. Can add it to board, or replace previous tile (except one with a pyramid on it). If the tile you place has a temple on it (keyed to 1 of the 3 icons on the tiles) that is part of a civ, get 1VP per matching icon on the continent that the civ controls. Replacing a tile can cause 2 civs to come into contact (War) or divide a civ's continent, forcing it to move to one of the new areas (Migrate); in either case, you must discard one of your followers. Wars are resolved by the # of sword icons in each civ; ties decided by player. Losing civ is removed from board, and all players lose those colored followers. In Migration, the civ preferentially goes to the continent with more grain-icons (and prefers continents to islands).
2. Either start a new civ (if 1 of the 5 in the game is still off board, AND there's an unoccupied continent) or take a follower (if there's one available in the pool that matches a civ already in play). If you start a new civ, you get a number of followers equal to # grain-icons on the continent.
3. Optional: turn in 1 of your 3 scoring markers to score all your followers. Each follower is equal to 1VP per cup-icon on the continent their civilization controls.
4. Draw a tile to add to your hand. If you draw an Epoch card, Epoch Scoring occurs: all players score for their followers. Each follower is worth as many VP as there are pyramids in that civ's continent. Draw a replacement tile (repeat till you have 2 non-Epoch tiles in hand).
Game ends when all players have used all their (3) scoring tokens, or the 6th, 7th or 8th Epoch tile is scored (for 2, 3 or 4 players).

I admire what this game is trying to do; basically be a more tactical and strategic Carcassone, but I personally do not like how the game realizes this goal.  The board in its entirety is rather ho-hum to look at and is somewhat headache inducing because all the tiles look very similar and are packed into a small space.  I like the idea of directly messing with someone's plans by replacing any tile you wish, but your meddling is just as easily undone via replacing the same tile again.  Another "problem" I experienced is what I refer to as the Pangea effect, in which a very large continent eventually develops with a civilization that lets one or two players start running away with the game.  I don't think this game is broken or terrible in its mechanics, I personally just don't really care for it much.  I'd much rather play Carcassone.

like placing tiles to make the world

allows you to be very aggressive in wiping out civ's with war or starvation

liked how you don't have 'your' civ but get followers in any and how they were spent if you did aggressive actions

chooseing when to score most points but other scoring happens randomly

quick under 1 hour

tl;dr: average but slightly too aggressive tile layer

I've had this game since I got a copy at Spiel 2006, but I hadn't played it in 8 years. I recently tried it again.

This game came out at a time where [thing=822][/thing] clones where still a hot topic. The difference here, apart from the obvious triangle shape of course, is that tiles can be replaced.
The main source of points is creating civilizations, getting followers for them, boosting their value and using your 3 scoring tiles at the right moments. Where it gets a bit aggressive is with the replacing of tiles.
In most cases multiple players will have a shared interest in civilizations. If one player sees one or more other players rake in points for those, he will try and stop that. By replacing tiles, civilizations can be sent to an area where no points are, they might be sent to an island (they are removed from the board and players collections) or they might come in conflict with a more powerful civilization (and also be removed). This can be pretty tough for the players on the receiving end.
In the end I think this is a pretty solid design, but it's just a bit too aggressive for my part. I understand this allows for very strategic moves for players who are behind, but it can also be used by players who are ahead to stop others from catching up.
I would have preferred the game to have an other mechanism for allowing redistribution of civilization followers during the game.

A nice little tile laying game, that is somehow just a little more complicated to learn than it feels like it needs to be. Underneath that though, is an interesting game that has some promise and allows various methods of play.

This wasn't bad, but it bogs down a bit. Even with just two tiles to place, the ability to replace existing tiles on the map presents a staggering number of options for players - too many for a smoothly flowing game.

THig game is a lot of fun, has a good level of player interaction and gives that "Hey I played a civ game" feeling in 30-45 minutes. Plays best with 4 players, 2 player games are just too close and three players usually sees a real competition between two players and the third one as an odd-man out, although with more experienced players this becomes less of an issue as alliances form and dissolve rapidly.

TRADED AWAY --- I was very excited about Gheos in October of 2006 when it was released. I’d read the rules and it sounded like a wonderful mix of the tile-laying from Carcassonne with the civilization building from Tigris & Euphrates with the timing mechanic from Ra. It was a match made in heaven since those are all games I love. I was so willing to give Gheos a chance that I actually played it 14 times before eventually trading it away. In practice the game just doesn’t seem to work. The rules seemed great, but the game itself didn’t live up to my hopes. The problems with the game are difficult to describe, but basically it’s too chaotic and too difficult to come back from a deficit. The first problem is that it’s too chaotic because players can either play a new tile to expand the landscape or play a new tile to replace an existing tile. While you have to pay sometimes when replacing, there are many times when you can replace without paying, and the cost isn’t very large anyway, so the land masses are constantly shifting and rarely growing. This makes the lifespan of the civilization much shorter than in Tigris & Euphrates. The second problem is that it’s very difficult to catch up once you fall behind because the leader can simply take followers in the same civilizations and match the person they’re beating stride for stride to make sure the gap can’t be closed. The limited number of followers available in each civilization is a neat idea, but in practice it means the players, especially in a two-player game, won’t be able to differentiate themselves significantly if one player is trying to prevent that from happening. Finally, I have to say that the artwork is very distracting with all of the grain, sword, cup, temple, and pyramid symbols strewn across the landscape making it very difficult to read the map at a glance.

This is a neat little tile laying stock market game.  Tiles have some combination of icons which allow starting a civilization (wheat), scoring (cups) or determining who wins a war in a merge (swords), or where civilizations migrate (also wheat).  Their are also temples that score icons, and pyramids that score at epochs.  The war/migration tile replacement mechanism is really what elevates the game and makes it a brain burner.  It might be a little luck dependent as tile draw can give a nice play.

"Carcassonne with teeth" it was described to me as.  I agree - and I liked it.  I love the decision making process.  Do I extend a civilisation I'm doing well in?  Protect another?  Attack an opponents?  Start a new one?  

The many possibilities yet shortish play time make this a winner.

I purchased this hoping for an alternative to Carcassonne for some variety in my tile-laying games. Being as anal as I am, the tile replacement is not something I enjoy. It feels clumsy to pull tiles out from the middle of an arrangement. I still prefer Carcassonne when I want a tile game.

I played this for the first time twice with my wife the other night. I won the first game and she the second. Since I was the one who hade read the rules I might have had a head start in the first game. In the second game she just raced ahead of me by playing scoring markers at just the right moments.
We will play this game again I am sure. The rules  are simple in itselves - the thing that you have to check over and over again is how scoring is carried out in different situations, but in the end of our second game we did not need to check the rules very often. I think we have to play this more to fully appreiciate it, since there must be lots of hidden (for a newbie) strategies to find out.
Overall - Excellent game mechanics, but perhaps not really "funny" to make it great in all aspects. 

after more plays - rating upped from 7 to 8.

It is quite hard to rate this game. On the one hand, you have a ruleset that seems impossible to remember, quite a lot of randomness and a chaotic endgame. On the other, you have an exciting midgame, lots of options for tile laying and a clever "stock system".
Really, half way through a game I loved this game, but by the end it disappointed the hell out of me. The endgame makes you feel like you have been out of control the entire time. And that is a real shame.

It's like Carcassonne, with confrontation (good), but also a resultant chaos (bad).  Plus, one of the endgame conditions is completely random, which makes it possible for some games to end before they even get interesting.  I'd like to play it a couple of more times before I make a final judgment on the game, but so far, it's just not very interesting.

This is a game I wanted to love. So far I don't. Part of the problem is I haven't internalized all the rules and possibilities well enough to just roll with it. I end up spending a lot of time referring back to the rules for one thing or another. It also gets a little fiddly with putting tiles on top of other tiles. If I could get a few good plays in in a short time, the rating might go up.

One game, maybe two, and i fell in love with this overlooked masterpiece. I need to find it somehow.
One of the first game I saw where players can form a sort of temporary alliance and they must know when to abandon it. Wonderful!

[Edit]
For years, Gheos was a game i deemed incredibly good and fun and i really wished to find at a good price to buy it. I was sure it was one of my favourite games ever.
After a long time i had the occasion of playing it again, three times, all of them in 2 players. My opinion has unfortunately changed and i dunno what could happen if i played it again.
Ghoes is too chaotic, out of control, fragmented, without the possibility to build and follow a strategy. Few choices, too luck, runaway leader... dunno... i am still very confused because it seems such a good game but playing it it feels so different. I would have killed to find a copy at a decent price, i neeed it for my collection. but now, i would buy it only at a very low price.

I am profoundly sad about it, like meeting a persone after a long time and understanding he's not the nice person you remembered.

The players are gods at the dawn of time, creating earth's landscape and inhabiting it with people. The game is fairly simple, but offers quite a lot of tactical possibilities. 

Play involves placing and replacing triangular tiles to form islands, coastlines and continents. Each civilization is represented by a color and once a civilization is "born" a player can gain worshipers in that civilization, which in turn may score points for that player in various ways.

This game is planned for release at Essen 2006 by Z-man Games. I designed this game for the "Doomed Civilization" contest held on the bgdf.com website, back in 2003, which it won.

A quick disclaimer first: we had a rule explained incorrectly to us for about half of the game (the 2nd action in which you can either start a new civilizaion or claim a follower of an existing one; we were told that you can do the latter part only if you had expanded that particular civilization's area).

I should like this more than Carcassonne, which I've found to be getting tedious the more I played; and the way how one civilization can absorb another was reminiscent of the corporation merger in Acquire.  However, the game seem somewhat chaotic and almost uncontrollable in comparison, especially if you tend to draw the tiles with 3 islands on them.  I do enjoy the mechanics, and the unique scoring lends itself to interesting and unexpecting plays, but as some people have stated, the method for ending the game (as well as to trigger the pyramid scoring) was too random and often disruptive.  Will require more exposure to get a better feel for it.

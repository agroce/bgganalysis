RATING: 7
Caught a demo recently of this one.  Sort of along the lines of WizKids last boardgame, Tsuro, but has a bit more depth to it.  Lots of pre-planning and setting up to do with your moves like Chess.  Looks to be a keeper.  I think my rating will go up to an 8 after another play or 2.

A Zen-like abstract game somewhat reminiscent of moving the Rooks in Chess.  I think Chess, Go and Abalone players would love it.  It's a real thinker and although I haven't worked out any really good strategies myself yet, it can't be long before someone writes a whole article on just that.  I'd say that keeping pieces together in the middle of the board and making a line of 4 (which can't be pushed) seems to be a possibility - but it'll only take you so far!

Lovely pieces - it's definitely a "coffee-table game" as well as a player.

I'm sure this will come out a lot over the years and my 7 year old son has already got a yen for it.

Simple abstract stratregy.  Unfortunately its too simple.  My first game ended in stalemate.  If playing against a good player this appears always to end in Stalemate where neither player can knock the other playerss last piece off the board.

I built a theme variant on this one out of clay, a slab of wood and some paint. Plays like chess lite, with the same problems you would encounter in it.

RATING: 7
I quite like this game.  First off, the rules are very simple.  You can teach someone (even a non-gamer) to play in about 7-10 minutes.  Second, it's something that appeals to non-gamers.  It's not flashy or complicated looking (but still stylish), it's a very quick game to play (generally).  Third, I can actually get the girlfriend to play (which is always a plus!).

- Not my cup of tea. It has a surprisingly tacky board.

RATING: 5
I like abstracts, so I am biased toward them.  I like the push mechanism used as the central capture method in this game.  The game does suffer towards the end in that it can degrade to a chase situation.  At that point conceding the win is the right thing to do.  You won't even have to use a sharp blade - you can simply say ' enough'.

Good 2 player abstract. This is another game where I just can't wrap my head around the strategy. When should I move my tallest piece? When should I try to block? Despite the fact that I have lost the game all 5 times I have played it, I do think it's worth a look for fans of abstracts like chess or checkers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Lots of fun. A definite must own. Purchase this when you see it. The publisher has a history of limited runs. Simple and intricate. Very easy to learn. (As good as Tsuro) I found the presentation and pieces a little more budget than what I expect from Wizkids - I'd give it a ten if the piecesd were of a higher quality. The board is of very high quality why not make bits to match? However, fun to play and a great 2 player game to add to my collection. This is a great game for fans of chess, tsuro, deflexion, go etc...

RATING: 4
I don't like abstracts.  This game is no exception.  I'm sure that I missed something important about putting opposition pieces in "checkmate" because after 20 minutes of dancing around the board with the 2 and 3 tall buildings, I was ready to push my own pieces off of the board.

Really enjoyable abstract.  Some users' comments don't seem to fit this game; it seems they either didn't do their diligence in reading the instructions or really aren't the target audience for Oshi.  It's not the shortest or fastest game out there, nor is it the longest or most complicated or involved.  It's just an all around good abstract, and as a plus you can use its board to play Shogi, if you're like me and have a little box of wooden Shogi pieces lying around.

Quick and enjoyable. Kind of like a halfway point between checkers and chess in terms of strategy. The gameplay is simple enough to explain in about a minute and yet it allows for a certain amount of planning ahead to try and trap your opponent rather than just getting lucky.

This game is alright. I will definitely play it again, it's just very light. I believe I played two games in less than a half hour. Being too timid to start can leave you screwed but taking the offensive can leave you in a bind when you need back up for your maneuvers. It's like a light version of chess where strategy is concerned.

A nice idea for an abstract, but it takes a real special hook to make something feel like it's worth more than a game of checkers. Oshi has that back and forth feel of Abalone that I eventually tired of and here it feels even more plodding. Nice pieces but a boring runaround of a game that is immediately forgettable.

This was an ok little abstract strategy game that could have made a great coffee-table centerpiece if WizKids hadn't gotten cheap on their production values.  

They decided to go with a wood board, but instead of the nice board with beveled edges that they show on the box, the board that comes with the game is square edged and often of poor quality.  The one I've actually played on was warped, and I've heard of other problems.

I had thought about getting this as a gift for some friends, like I did with Tsuro the year before, but after actually seeing a copy I decided to give it a pass.

Nice abstract that plays like Abalone combined with simplified Chess. The actual board is not that good as the board displayed underneath the box. The corners are not rounded, the color is not uniform, the board is not polished and the wood grain is very rough. Don't expect quality on par with Pin products.

Oshi played more dynamically than I expected. The stalemate rule helps prevent the game from getting too stagnated but I still think it's a danger.

However, with all the amazing abstracts that have come out over the last ten years (the Blokus family, the GIPF Project, Hive), Oshi is not a tier one abstract.

Fairly easy to play, but may take some time to master.  There are three different types of pieces, which can move 1, 2 or 3 spaces (depends on the size/height of the piece).  Each of these may move/push up to 1, 2 or 3 pieces, again depending on the size/height.  The first person to push off the board 7 points worth of pieces from his/her adversary wins.  And you guessed it, each piece is worth 1, 2 or 3 points, based on it's size/height.

1-2-3 tower can move 1-2-3 places; can push 1-2-3 pieces. You can't end up in the same position you were in when you started your previous turn.

2 plays.  A light abstract game that has simple rules but the depth of strategy is questionable.

Great little abstract game, with some simple rules but just about the right level of depth.  The endgame seems to drag some, but maybe this is just my perception.  If it doesn't, would have to move up to an 8.

UPDATE: I'm not super crazy about the endgame on this one; the pieces aren't quite mobile enough to bring about a swift ending.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's an abstract, Chess-like game. The pieces are 1, 2 or 3 (n) levels high. They move orthogonally up to n spaces, and may push up to n pieces as they move. Each is worth n points. There's a defined starting setup, then you alternate turns. The first person to push 7 points of the opponent's pieces off the edge wins!

I think fans of abstract strategy would like this. It was too much like Chess for us, though!

This abstract didn't quite "click" with me.  Felt a little too chess-like for my tastes.

A decent little abstract game reminiscent of Abalone.  I would call it a light or filler abstract game.

Simil scacchi in cui bisogna spingere fuori gioco i pezzi avversari unendo le forze dei propri.

I've a home-made version of this game [rules, a shogi-ban and hotel-units from "Advance to Boardwalk"] which I played over shabbat. This isn't the best game nor is it the worst. It IS a pure abstract strategy game which is good but pushing pieces off the edge is just not the best game premise.

This is a really great game if you want an alternative to chess on a night!

ωραιο abstract game για 2 παικτες.Ισως εχει καποια μειονεκτηματα δεδομενου οτι οι 3πλοι πυργοι ειναι πολυ δυνατοι αλλα υπαρχουν πολλες μανουβρες να επιχειρησεις.
Πιθανοτατα με τελειο παιχνιδι και απο τους 2 να καταληγει ισοπαλια.Γενικα μαρεσε και σιγουρα θα του εκανα αρκετα plays μεχρι να βρω τη στρατηγικη και τα κοπλα που ταιριαζουν.Επισης το παιχνιδι ειναι ακρως επιθετικο αμα μεινεις στην αμυνα χανεις.

οποτε συνοψιζοντας πολυ ωραιο ταμπλο ειδικα η αφη του ξυλου ειναι καταπληκτικη αλλα τα κομπονεντσ ειναι απο απλο παλστικο.Επισης πολυ ωραια αισθηση παιχνιδιου (η κλασσικη abstract) που ομως δεν τελειωνει πολυ γρηγορα σαν να θελες το κατι παρπανω.Φυσικα ειναι πολυ καλυτερο απο αλλα του ειδους του και ας εχει χαμηλοτερη βαθμολογια(π.χ quarto,othello κλπ)Τελος το παιχνιδι δεν φαινεται τοσο δυσκολο και μπορεις με λιγη σοβαρη σκεψη να βελτιωσεις το παιχνιδι σου.

αρχικα ενα 7αρι αν ξαναβρεθει ωστε να ξαναπαιχτει μπορει να αλλαξει η βαθμολογια και τα σχολιο να γινει edit

Good game, easy to set up, and was fast to teach to a young child. She really liked it and asks to play this quite a bit.

Decent little game, and very fast to play once you get the hang of it. No support by WizKids though. 

Doesn’t get played. Would rather it find a home where it will get played.

I enjoy chess-style games and all things Japanese, thus, this game is a perfect mixture of the two.  The components are top-notch and I was pleasantly surprised to see a wooden board in the release.

A chess like game, but far quicker and not as complicated. If you like that sort of thing, I heartily recommend it.  Not a massive score as I feel it wouldn't stand up to repeat plays all that well, but definitely something to crack out every now and again.  A lot like chess actually.

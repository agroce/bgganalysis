TABLETOP MINIATURE WARGAME (Out of Print)

Some of the best mini, sculpts on the market. Rules are range from complex to confusing at times. Still quite an intriguing system ... pity it lost momentum.

Armies owned: Limbo of Acheron, Dwarves of Mid-Nor

I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

Confrontation is the first heavy miniature game I've ever tried. It just so happens that some friends of mine are really big fans of this game and, since Battlelore (Second Edition) is one of my favorite games, I figured I could try this one out. I must say, I really wasn't impressed.

I have to admit that the miniatures look really cool and that I didn't try to customize my army yet, which I imagine is where most of the fun in Confrontation lies, but my first impression was basically that of an overcomplicated dice game. There's so many fiddly rules to remember and so many exceptions to them, but at the end of the day the game-flow is just A TON of dice rolls. You roll for initiative, then to recover magic, for the spells, to hit the target, to see how much damage your attack did... and so on and so forth. This doesn't just make the game an insane luck fest, because you can hardly - as far as I saw - manipulate the dice rolling, but it also makes the game feel like a very slow battle, which completely lacks excitement. Second, it seems that there's really some balance issues happening here and it's something that even my friends recognized.

Confrontation made me realize even more, why I like Battlelore so much. Sure both games involve a lot of luck, but I feel like in Battlelore I can help my luck by placing my units in a certain way or using other units' abilities to increase my odds... and even when the attack fails, I often get something anyway, like mana I can spend for spells or I can force the enemy unit to retreat. In Confrontation all you do is hope to roll as many sixes as you possibly can... and, if you don't, "it sucks to be you". But then again, the real reason why I didn't enjoy Confrontation is the lack of excitement in my turns. In Battlelore I don't have to measure for movement, I don't have to check the rulebook every minute, I don't have to roll a die if I want to breathe that turn. Someone might not like this simplification, but I find that it allows you to do the one thing that is actually fun about these games: fight. All the missing book-keeping in Battlelore is turned into exciting moves. That's why I think Richard Borg's design is the better game here.

RATING: 8
The best miniature wargame in the market. Complex to a level of simplicity, flavorful and filled with interesting short stories..

Not as widely accepted as WH and WH40K, but the miniatures are quite a few cuts above them or any other game. Beautiful even when unpainted. Once painted, they are second to none...not to mention if they are painted by masters!

Game play is very good with an element of chit-pull. Each battle is different from the rest. Excellent game system.

C3 is my all time favorite miniatures game.  The models are beautiful the game mechanics are unique with a multitude of options and strategies.  If you like mianiture games this is THE BEST!!!

RATING: N/A
Rules are a bit "hurriedly written" and there's too much luck (as in WHFB), some miniatures are a true masterpiece, others are ugly and grotesque. The costs are too high and it doesn't work as a battle game (but it is nice enough for a skirmish). It seems that Rackham is taking the same road that GW took long ago.

Great game, amazing sculpts, the rules get better with every edition.  Can take a while to really get the hang of the rules, but once you have them, it's no problem.  The only real problem is that it is too addicting! I want to collect every army. :)   Current armies:  Alchemists of DirzDevourers of Vile-TisLions of AlahanTonight I am starting with the Dogs of War supplement.

Un revulsivo contra el mal del Warhammer. Barato en las miniaturas, creo que por 60 euros tenias una buena banda para jugar. Y con una calidad de modelado bastante mejor que las de Games WorkShop. Comento esto porque es lo primero que miré/ramos todos aquellos que veniamos quemados del Warhammer. 
Basado en un mundo de Fantasia con un montón de razas distintas, Y con un excelente trasfondo, el juego representa pequeñas escaramuzas entre dos bandas con distintas misiones.. El sistéma usa los centimetros y viene todo represenatdo por cartas que hacen desde milagros, hechizos, invocaciones... 
Merece la pena acercarse a él. Además le guardo un enorme cariño . Su ampliación Perros de Guerra (Dogs of war) representaba la banda a traves de la experiencia pudiendo mejorar en habilidades,  atributos, incluso de nuevos guerreros a la banda... una pasada

RATING: N/A
The system is very focussed on small scale combat. Models become wounded and suffer penalties for wounds. Each model also chooses between how much they attack and how much they defend. I find this level of depth very satisfying. I can't judge how good the game is yet unforetunately as I have only played single unit vs. single unit, which is, of course, hugely unbalanced. I need to try army vs. army. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I actually like both the skirmish rules and the miniatures.  Though I admit the quality of the miniatures far outweighs the quality of the rules.  However, I like the skirmish rules more than say, Mordheim.  In particular, the target system for damage can make for some thrilling combats.  I think it takes some time to learn the nuances of the game, and it doesn't help that the rules are a bit spotty.  The french magazine Ravage has lots of wonderful articles for Confrontation... including rules for a Skaven warband, but of course, they're in french. :(

Nice enough tabletop.
I play it occasionally, using my Griffons.

Nice little anecdote: My Griffon Paladin once managed to stand his ground against the Dragon, not receiving any injury when the beast attack. He didn't injure the Dragon either, but this was the last fight of the last turn and had the Paladin fallen (a likely outcome) I would've lost the game.

RATING: 7
If that 40K is football for geeks (which it is- four hours of talking and about 10 minutes spent actually playing), then Confrontation is more of a fencing match, much more refined and requiring more finesse.  It's a really great product all around, the minis are the best in the business, practically everything you need to play is in the pack (no buying Codexes and all that nonsense), and most figures are good for all three Rackham games (Hybrid and Rag'narok as well).  The gameplay is dramatic and engaging and the rules, after a short learning curve, are sensible and simple.  Oh, BTW, I hate miniature games in general.

I think combat resolution leaves the defender passive. No "saves" to roll, all rolls are done by the attacker (roll to hit followed by a roll to penetrate). Leaves the defender to just watch idly. Felt one sided in that way. Hard to follow as a non-metric user.

I wouldn't class this as a board game.  The most impressive part of this game is the miniatures.  Rackham makes the best looking minis on the market.  That combined with the fact that the rules for the game are combined with the minis makes this a great one.

RATING: 8.9
Really love the game - the mechanics once you have them down allow even the lowliest troop to be a hero on a great roll, and the figures are truely beautiful...even the undead. All the armies have their own individual play style because of the special abilities and the "bidding" style of hit rolls is very challenging. Check it out - it actually does not cost much to give it a shot to see if you like it (the cost of a few blister packs VS the cost of an "beginner" box set in other games)

RATING: 6
Difficult to judge, gameplay is choppy, sometimes lightning fast and exciting, sometimes it bogs down to a halt whilst figuring out different morale and magical checks. Figures are benchmark for the hobby, sometimes the choppiness is worth it just to put those beautiful figures on the table (provided you paint them right!)

As a game, Confrontation suffers from byzantine rules, but on the other hand is not nearly as expensive as Warhammer. The miniature quality however, set standards not yet reached by anyone in the industry. Even now they fetch huge prices on ebay. The rating reflects the miniatures more than the game itself.

This is one of the few wargame rulesets that does nothing for me, as I found it rather boring.  I also didn't care for the overly stylized minis; is there a single figure in this line that doesn't look like it's on crack?  The detail and production qualities are top notch though, and do respect it for that.  There are much better skirmish games on the market if you're willing to look.

Confrontation is a very good miniature game. It is fun. It is detailed. It has the best miniatures ever released. Unfortunately... it is not balanced. Some armies are better than others, expecially when they are maximizing their specific powers. Also, and this is an even more important problem with the game, numbers in this game mean everything. One should be able to have a small, but powerful, army, and be able to deal with a more numerous but less elite army fairly, but in Conf more often than not whoever is in numerical superiority is at big advantage. If you don't play competitively Conf is a great game, but this is a problem that still stands with current rules.

Although C3 is a evolution of C2 and has a best system, STR and RES are extremely important and unbalanced respect others characteristics. Playing races with low STR or RES is a bit frustrating; so playing big guys is compulsory. C3.5 Expansion has interesting changes, except artillery and magic which are mostly unbalancing. With C3.5 playing mages is almost compulsory too. C2 is a more random and lightly worst system but is very much fun. Most of miniatures are astonishing

A very good miniature skirmish game, with clever mechanics that infuse a sense of realism and simulation without swamping the game in bureaucracy (the two-dice damage rolls in particular). 

The dark fantasy background is very well characterized too, and ties in well with the outstanding artwork (and figures). I even went to the extent of painting one miniature for this one!

Glad to have the possibility of playing this, as it fills a gap in my collection, even if only with the starter rules.

It's true the miniatures are fantastic though the metal could be of slightly better quality. Prices are high by individual model prices but gamewise it all comes down to about the same as any GW product...though that's not necessarily a good thing... since it uses less miniatures. The rules are not so clear but after a couple of re-reads and test games they reveal level of subtle meat to the skirmish rules without a WHOLE lot of detail.

This comment is for the miniatures only - I haven&#039;t played the game itself. Minis vary from great to stunningly beautiful. The casting is well done (not much retouching needed). The only drawback is the price per model, which is comparable to Citadel/GW metals, i.e. rather expensive.

This is the BEST miniatures skirmish game period.  Steep learning curve due to being different than any other system.  But extremeley solid, and reasonably quick once the rules are understood.  Amazingly balanced considering the breadth of the line!

Note, I haven't played the 3rd edition ruleset yet, and am a little wary of it since it looks like they may have taking most of the unique stuff out of the game.

I have now--the 3rd editions rules suck the life from a great great game.  If you truly want to enjoy the system, get the older miniatures--every mini comes with the full rules to play.  For magic rules, you need to also buy a magic-using mini.  Actually very affordable considering they didn't make you buy a separate rulebook.

A nice skirmish tabletop game with gorgeous miniatures (I believe still the best I've seen).
Unfortunately, the 3rd edition had too many card-errata for previously published miniatures, and later units became quite unbalanced for gameplay.

The combat system breaks new barriers....maybe thats why most are a bit confused during the 1st few sessions. Once you get the hang of the rules then you'll see finesse and classiness in style and gameplay. Even the background materials are great reads. Quality of miniatures? Industry shakers!!

The game is most remarkable by the astoundingly beautiful miniatures produced by Rackham for it.

I miss confrontation. Shame that the makers had to screw up a good game so completely.

The miniatures are amazing, an easy 10.  Unfortunately the rules are awful... some of the worst wargame rules I've ever read.  Take the miniatures and use them in Warhammer or Warmachine.  You'll have lots more fun.

To my surprise this game and this minis caught my attention and open my mind to the wargames. I supose the reason is because they use a reduce number of minis rather than a large army groups... a good strike for Rackham!!

Probably my favorite of the 'dedicated' miniatures games.
I wanted to like war machine/hordes, but this was more fun.
Go Figure.

My entry into the world of miniatures gaming. I love this system. Would like to try a Rag'narok game at some point (large battle rather than skirmish), but for now, playing Confrontation scenarios is great fun.

Confrontation has some fresh views to skirmishing. And I LOVE those models. Models are best that I have seen. I started to collect this games almost purely because of these models. Game itself feels little slow for a skirmish game, but it is probably because I'm still new to the game. 2 player games can be played in a tolerable time, but when there are more players, gameplay bogs down.

Good miniature skirmish game. Dogs of War campaigns get twisted as some parties grows too strong while others stay virtually the same.
Game is near dead since the company (rakham) decided to produce plastic (bad) prepainted figs instead of their crisp pewter figs.
As a result stores are selling-out the metal figs with up to 50% discount.
So even if not buying for Confrontation, you can purchase beautiful figs for RPG or generic fantasy rules.

An inferior skirmish game. The rules are hard to understand and very slow to resolve.

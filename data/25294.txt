Total brain-burner.  It's a puzzle game and, though I generally like puzzles, this one just doesn't quite do it for me.  Still, it's a good game with a good concept and good gameplay.  One reason I didn't rate the game play weight heavier or give the game a lower rating is that the game length is about right, it's not too long.

You could say it scales well up to 6 players, but there's absolutely no player interaction and (generally) very little waiting on other players.  More people does not mean more time.  This one actually [i]is[/i] multiplayer solitaire.

Even though it wouldn't be my first choice, I would play it again because it's a good puzzle game that doesn't take that long.

This really is multi-player solitaire, a fun puzzle to play simultaneously with others (like a bingo, but good). An occasional play would be fun.

(Now I have Take It Easy, I don't need this too, so removed from my wish list.)

RATING: 8.5
Pipe-fitters' Bingo, but the sort in which you mostly have yourself to blame if the last numbers called [i]really[/i] mess up your best laid plans. Also a game in which you can be chuffed to bits with your own cleverness when a tile fits particularly well.

So, [gameid=128] has grown up, and is still a pleasingly tasty dish of simply matching coloured pipe tiles, camouflaging a clever game of numbers and probability. But somehow the handful of extra ingredients have stirred up a pure taste explosion. Although I'm pretty sure there will be people who'll consider the increased BOARD size, additional bonus points, scrapyard board, and new means to keep a pipe "alive" unnecessary clutter, I'm in the exact opposite camp. I'm amazed how snugly these additions integrate with the original game. Maybe they wanted to be a natural part of it all along.

I certainly prefer Take it to the Limit over its earlier incarnation. The new challenges uncover a whole new layer of agonizing decision making, increase their depth, and what was a sweet filler has just become a spicy main course, using near identical ingredients. A master-chef-stroke has made this one of the better competitive puzzles out there. Even folk who usually shun the more abstract games will often find this too intriguing to dismiss. It has become a bit longer to play, but you won't notice, and still immediately suggest a rematch or two. Highly addictive.

It's easy to presume that since everyone gets the same tiles to play, that there is no real luck involved, but that's only a half-truth. Everyone will have to commit at some point, and the moanful groans and small cries of joy that accompany every one of the last few tiles will give you an immediate indication whose luck has just run out, and who is still in the running for the top prize. But keeping your options open as long as possible is pure skill, and dealing with a tile that really doesn't fit is almost more fun than just plonking the one in that fits perfectly. To block a pipe that you worked hard for, and that looked so promising, is like sacrificing one of your own kids: heartbreaking. You'll quickly realize that taking great care in placing the sun and moon tiles is the key to a high-scoring board. We prefer the option where tiles may be placed anywhere on the board over the one where tiles need to be joined to what's already there.

Additional players will add a bit of downtime, as each player will face tricky tiles that take some placement consideration at different points in the game. But since each one knows exactly how nice it is to have that wee bit more time when you get one of those tiles, it is also easy to be patient when someone's frown gets deeper the longer they stare at their board.    

I would give it a 9 if it came with a little Bingo gnome to sort out the tiles before the game can start, so they are easier to spot when the drawing player calls them out. But that is really the only bit that vaguely irritates me. But how many games can you name that are equally entertaining when played solo?

I like this as a solo puzzle.  Fun!

Aug 2014 - Finally played it again after years.  Still really dig it.  I like puzzles and this one scratches a nice itch.  Doesn't take all that long, either (and plays six out of the box).  It's the cussing game as every pull someone is swearing.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Good puzzle game that is mostly solitaire.  More of an "end of the night" game since it doesn't require a lot of brain power.  However, it does run a bit on the long side (especially with the setup/sorting of the tiles).

RATING: 5
I like Take it Easy, and I thought I'd like this even more ... but I don't :( Nexus Board seems to big - making the game drag, especially tallying up at the end. Orchid board is nice, but doesn't seem to add much over the original. I think I'd rather play the original version (if I had it)     update - traded this away and got Take it Easy, so can't see me playing this again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A good game because there really are a ton of risk/reward decisions to be made.  A little frustrating because things almost always go wrong, but then again I'd take frustrating over a game that elicited no reaction any day. If it's frustrating, they must have done something right...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Since the essence of TiE's appeal is its simplicity and this is a more complex version, I wasn't expecting to like it much.  It was therefore a pleasant surprise to play and enjoy it - not as much as the original, admittedly, but this is still worthwhile playing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Further play has improved my opinion of Take it to the Limit. This is a much more interesting, more tactical version of Take it Easy. Take it Easy was a wonderful, accessible, light-ish game; Take it to the Limit is a much more textured, subtle, and interesting borderline gamer's-game. It's still fundamentally a risk-taking game, but there are so many more subtleties to the risk-taking, and so many more flavors of risk, that it makes for a far more engaging game for the experienced gamer (I wouldn't spring it on a casual or first-time gamer though; Take it Easy is the much more effective gateway game).

I like both the Nexus and the Orchid board; they're both very clever. The Orchid is definitely more playable, quicker, and the better choice for first-timers (even those who have played the original Take it Easy). If you're going to play with casual gamers, the Orchid is the way to go. The Nexus board is meatier and a real challenge.

Almost worth getting a second copy so you can play with 7-12. 12 might be too many, but 7-8 would be cool.

I love Take It Easy, but Take it to the Limit just seems to add complexity where it wasn't needed.  The Nexus board is just too large and feels more random due to the extra size.  The orchid board is interesting as a variation to original TiE - but I'm not sure it's really adding that much.  Don't get me wrong this is certainly good, but I'd maybe 85% of the time pick original Take It Easy over it if I wanted to play a game.

I like this game a lot.  It is great because if you have several copies, an unlimited number of people can play.  It is great for big groups.... it is fun to hear people agonizing over the decisions they are being forced to make. :)  I prefer the more basic rules-it is already plenty to think about.  We usually play with the basic rules plus the bonus tiles but without the moons and suns.  We haven't tried playing with the side board yet but I hope to soon.

Is math fun?  If so, you'd like this more than I.  There are other fun parts, such as the anticipation that you'll get the tile you need, and the bitching when you get one you don't.  A game I'll play but won't own, because, to me, math isn't fun.

More interesting than the original. Use the Orchid board for a game that is about as quick as the original and a bit more complex. Use the Nexus board for a rich, somewhat lengthy game with abundant scoring possibilities to fret over. In the latter case, don't neglect the mis-named Scrapyard, which should get its fair share of attention to avoid the penalty.

Good (light) puzzle type game. Completely multi-player solitare but given the short playing time that is no problem. Creates a good amount of angst and tension for such an abstract game.

Very colourful and well produced - the riot of colour suits the game well, unlike on Kamisado (by the same makers)

An expanded, ramped up version of Take It Easy.  Players play the same tiles in Bingo caller fashion onto their own individual player mats.  The base game - the Nexus board - is a huge (compared to Take It Easy) playing area and includes a Scrap board for junking tiles.  There are several additional differences, including Bonus tiles, sun/moon tile suits, and looking after the Scrap board to avoid a penalty there.  The tile set has also been expanded, adding 10, 11 and 12 tiles now.  The flip side of the Nexus board is the Orchid board, which is much friendlier.  If you love Take It Easy, run for this game as it's bigger, more fiendish, and much better.  Great stuff - the only problem is that it's so hard to find in Australia.

I really enjoy playing the online solitaire game, Take it Easy, and was excited to learn an updated version was coming out.  You can still play the game with the original rules (more tiles in the new game however), but the nice thing about Take it to the Limit is the ability to choose among several new variants.  However you choose, play is addictive including some nice end game tension as you place your remaining tiles.

Let me say, I finished with 250+ points, the others finished with 400+ points. I really like Take It Easy, one of my all-time favourites, but I struggled badly with this version. Way over-egged, too much for me to handle. I'm back to the original. But the others really enjoyed it and it went down very well. Not for me though.

RATING: 7
The game's beauty appeals to me, and I enjoy the puzzle aspect of the game.  I like it that everyone plays with the same tiles, with the best strategic placement winning.  A sophisticated bingo.

There are two boards.  With the Nexus Board I prefer this as a solitaire game because it is so much faster.  When played against others there is a lot of down time.  In game prep each player (starting with the 2nd player) sorts their 64 tiles into 4 piles, then each time a tile is called, the tile has to be found in one of these piles before the player can begin deciding how to play it.

With the Orchard Board, you play with half the tiles which makes the game's down time, with two or more players, much less while they are searching-for-the-right-tile.

The game came so damaged inside (ink had rubbed off the boards) that I wrote and complained.  Much to their credit I received new boards quickly.  However, these boards are warped, and they are just too thin--this game is not cheap at $60.  The boards are reversible for a different game.  The tiles are of good heavy cardboard and punch out easily & a really sturdy box.  

I have mixed feeling about this game: attractive, fiddly with 2 or more players, good game design &  solitaire play, a mix of good & poor quality components, good customer service, educational game for learning multiplication.  I increased my rating on this game from a 6 to a 7 after playing the Orchard Board.

I have never played Take It Easy and was told that it was the simpler, family-friendly version of that game. Regarding "Take it to the limit", its a very good game, which reminds me somehow of "poker solitaire". There is a good tension between deciding which tile to keep and which to throw to the side board... Trying to score the "hubs" is an interesting challenge, and managing which lines you'll keep and which one you'll scrap is full of tough decisions. The only drawback is the setup time and the space needed on the table.

RATING: 9
What a super new game - Take It Easy with lots of extra ideas. The Scrapyard, a place to put unwanted tiles but at the risk of incurring 60 penalty points, is inspired. I also like the bonus scores available on some tiles provided that 2 or 3 lines are completed through them. The 64 tiles (as opposed to only 27 in Take It Easy) were a bit daunting at first but we soon became used to them. Lots of angst as one has to decide which rows to abandon. I would heartily recommend this game to lovers of Take It Easy and I can see it being played a lot.

Much better than Take it Easy.  The scrapyard and sun/moons add interesting elements of decision making, and mean that every tile play has meaning right through the end of the game.

Easy to teach and play, although a little more involved than its earlier sibling "Take it Easy".  Just try to complete as many rows of the same number as possible to score the highest total.  Includes 2 game boards in one - with slightly different goal in each.

I favour the more elegant simplicity of its smaller forerunner (a 10 for me) but this provides a good change of pace.  Both boards are interesting.  The large board makes for a longer game - especially while you try to save your bonuses.  Worth getting for jaded TIE fans

A tough solitaire puzzle with lots of complex scoring and lots of pieces that don't fit together. The random piece draw adds frustration. There's no player interaction whatsoever. Sorting out your dozens of unique pieces at the beginning is lame and time consuming. There are some interesting choices to be made in the course of the game, but the luck of the draw may mean all your plans will be for nothing. It just doesn't seem to be worth the effort.

I enjoy the game, but feel it can wear out its welcome.  Take It Easy fit a nice niche - everyone gets together, plays a short game and scores it.  This is about 2 1/4 times as long, and I'm not convinced that this game warrants such time.

Great tile-laying puzzle. The Bingo principle is taken to a new dimension which makes it a feasible principle for gamers. The rules can be explained in two minutes and everybody is involved all the time in this multiplayer solitaire. Even with many players there is no downtime and AP shouldn't become a problem. Too bad that my girlfriend didn't like it. It was horrible for her to destroy her coloured lines as she likes to build things. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Woah, this game is brutal!  I guess I'm not very good at regular Take It Easy, but the Nexus board really did me in.  Being much larger, it is even more painful when your best laid plans begin to unravel.  Having the scrapyard board is a great idea, and increases your options.  The bonuses are difficult (at least for me) to accomplish and I just simply stopped paying attention to the suns and moons.  For advanced Take It Easy players, I think this presents a whole new set of challenges.  For others, it could be a little intimidating.  I can see how the increased time length of the game could be a drawback for some, but it's still enjoyable, even if it hurts you to mess up that perfect row of 12's...

Definitely much more difficult and taxing than basic Take It Easy with a bigger board and a junk board where you must score 60 points to avoid losing 60 points.  So, you can throw away tiles to some degree, but it can still come back to bite you!  The bonus tiles are a nice mix to add in as well as completing all 3 pipelines will earn you 80 or 40 bonus points (or half of that bonus if you complete two of the three pipelines).  I haven't tried the orchid board yet.

So many second, expanded editions of games fail to meet my expectations (the only exception is Ubongo:  das Duell).  

This game is good, it gives you more options.  The 40 and 80 point bonus tiles get a little fiddly when it comes time to score,  but overall they force tougher decisions.  It does not get as much play as Take It Easy because it seems we are perennially playing with noobs who can't handle the big board.

I don't think this is better or worse than Take it Easy. It's simply a more complicated, longer, and more intricate elaboration. I do find it more interesting than the original but that's probably because it's new and somewhat different. Unlike the original, however, I find that playing one  round satisfies me sufficiently. Indeed, if I play more than one round I start trying to fit the tile pieces onto the board as I try to fall asleep. I do intend to play single round games more frequently and I like the expnaded layout and scoring options.

RATING: 8.5
Multiplayer solitaire game that is actually extremely fun! I never played Take it Easy, just went straight to this one and have not been disappointed at all.

A great game for all ages, and no one can complain about the luck one bit because everyone plays the exact same tiles in the exact same order, it is your choice of what to do with that tile.

Another great 'gateway' game to suck people into boardgaming. Not well known but should be!

Interesting game of connections.  As your board fills up, you end up sacrificing more and more plans.  A bit dry and set up can be a pain (sorting your tiles).

Interesting game where all players place the same randomly drawn tiles on their individual displays.
Definitely some luck, but strategy is still important.
It looks and sounds like a Bingo session, but way more fun!

Straight forward multi-player solitaire tile laying game. No pretense about the solitaire in the basic rules (although there are optional rules which add some interaction). Works well with pairs of players on each board. Simultaneous play for the most part so the pace is kept up.

Not nearly as good, clean, or quick as the original (Take it Easy)

Awesome game with a lot of potential for players ranging from 1 to 12+ (1-6 with a single copy).  Not quite Factory Fun, but still a great game with incredible potential.

Haven't played this yet, but my friend M Delano indicates this is head and shoulders better than the original. (I guess bc more strategy to mitigate bad draws) I'm sure I'll like it. Just need to get it to the table.

I haven't played 'take it easy'.  After our one game, a fellow player noted that he didn't see the need for this game to have been developed, since all the extra stuff doesn't add anything to the "take it easy" design.  Not even having played 'take it easy', I'm tempted to agree.  It seems like this would work fine as a simpler game without the extra fluff.  But on the other hand, it worked fine the way it was (we played the simpler variant with the Orchids) and I enjoyed the struggle against randomness and hoping for the right tiles to pop up.  

However, I understand that the harder version that we didn't play may add considerable to the challenge.  So my rating is tentative, pending playing that version.

The more I play this, the more I think that I'd prefer to stick to basic Take It Easy.  It seems a lot more luck dependent, and also a lot longer, which just means it's not as much fun.  I gave my copy to my sister, who seems to like it a lot more.

The gamer's version of one of the best non-gamers' games around.  Heaven and Hell in the same game.
A rare example of an increased rating from me - this has gone up following more plays.   Magic.

Neat game, but the very definition of multiplayer solitaire. I wonder if a variant where 2 tiles are drawn, and everyone VOTES on which to use would be neat...

Take it to the limit -- Played four- through eight-player.  The game could have been dry, but the speed of play prevents this.  Like Bingo, the number of players is only limited by the number of player boards.  Set-up is necessarily slow, making a computer version attractive, but the quick play more than makes up for the initial drag.  Surprisingly fun.

We own two copies, plus a couple extra player sets, so we can play up to 14 people.

I would describe it as a "puzzly-Bingo-Cable Car/Ta Yu" game. Each tun, players simultaneously place the same hex tile anywhere on their board. With each successive tile they are attempting to create unbroken paths of the same colors/numbers to score points. Easy...until you fill about 2/3rds of your board; you have to decide which paths to forego in the hopes of completing the others. A "puzzly" family game that plays up to 6 (or more) with little to no downtime.

A friend was selling some used games after I had picked what I wanted, I let my sister at his list.  She picked this game out and after playing it a few times with her realized I missed out on a gem.  

This is a great game for families or friends to play together - not highly strategic in it's design but very captivating - One of those games where after you use a specific tile in a place you really didn't want to, you immediately draw what would have been the perfect tile for that spot.

I am now on the lookout for a copy for myself !

If you really like the base game, this really adds some sweet twists for a larger board and using even more pieces to give you even more choices. It adds some twists with bonus tiles and a side board that counts for all-or-nothing as well as the Orchid board, that has some interesting optional choices about which pieces to count.

RATING: 6
A good game to play in a group. It really is multiplayer solitaire -- you're just competing to make the best use of the same set of tiles, drawn in the same random order, as every other player. This game steps up the difficulty from Take It Easy by having a bigger board, with more tiles to play, as well as a Scrapyard -- a smaller board where you must generate at least 60 points to avoid a -60 VP penalty (but you don't ever score any positive VP from the Scrapyard). Unfortunately, I think this version also slows the game down -- both from game play and from the somewhat painful scoring (bigger board = more to add up; and more ways to score now, too, from the suns and moons and silver/gold shields).

Reasonably fun if you have to game with a large group, but I'd rather play an actual game (versus this kind of group puzzle).

Wow, as if the original doesn't have enough turn angst already, now it's taken to a whole new level.  I expected just a larger board and more tiles, but there are some clever ideas here, such as the bonus tiles and the scrap yard.

[Burley Games 06 edition] {Party; puzzle, multiplayer-solitaire, tile-laying, simultaneous-action} Take it to the Limit can be named an advanced "Bingo!". It's a fun and challenging puzzle game. Replayability is good but it be better if more kinds of boards are provided. It's good for party and especially college students even though it is a multiplayer solitaire game. Though it's an abstract puzzle game, it is not brain-teasing and is quite fast-paced. Scoring is a little bit convoluted for some players but still manageable.

The bits are nicely made. The boards are sturdy and colors of the tiles are sharp enough. A plastic insert is provided to hold the bits nicely. However, the tray cannot hold all tiles for a color due to the different thickness of each color of tile!

[Take it easy!] I haven't played Take it easy! but I think Take it to the Limit is a more challenging edition without adding much down time.

A very welcome upgrade to Take It Easy. Takes a little longer, but well worth the time investment. If you liked Take It Easy, you should like this. If you thought the original was too simplistic, this might be more appealing.

Only played Orchid board. I expected a bingo-like game, but found a much more interesting activity of competing to best solve an emerging puzzle. My wife (a non-gamer) liked it, so it occupies a special place in my collection.

Cool multiplayer solitaire game. Like bingo with a lot more control. Like the basic version (Take it Easy!) better.

Like its simpler cousin, Take it Easy, Take it to the Limit is more of a puzzle than a game, which typically is a turn-off for me. But I enjoy both of these titles, and like the fact that the number of players is limited only to the number of copies of the game you have, and even the more complex Take it to the Limit is pretty accessible to inexperienced game players. Not sure which of these two titles I like better. The new wrinkles in the Take it to the Limit are cool, but the shorter play time of Take it Easy is a plus. In any event, I own both of these games and they're different enough that I plan to keep both in the collection.

RATING: 7
I suppose if you were only going to buy one version of Take It Easy, this might be it, but the larger boards could be off-putting to casual players.  The original is so incredibly versatile that Take It to the Limit might be a choice just for established spatial gamers.

RATING: 7.75
Loads of fun in the ultimate multi-player solitaire.  Has a bit of a Bingo feel to it, and we've actually played it with large groups of people and as many as three sets.  It's fun to chant out the numbers you are hoping for as the caller is selecting the tile.  Doesn't seem to influence the tile draw, but I keep doing it anyway.  A great way to finish a long day of gaming when you can't think anymore.

This edition has a few changes vs. [gameid=128] - more tiles for a longer game with the nexus board, additional scoring opportunities with sunbeams and moon rays, and more tile flexibility with the scrap yard (when playing with the nexus board) or with the orchid spaces (when playing with the orchid board).  A great addition to a classic game.

One of my favourites at Essen2006. The double sided board and several game variants are addictive, challenging and fascinating. Especially the idea of using a ScrapYard for unwanted tiles creates new tactical approaches. Great fun!

(addressed to chap who thinks the luck element is too high) Luck? Luck? Have you even opened the box and read the rules? The only luck in this game, good or bad, affects ALL the players simultaneously - got a crap score? That's your own fault, matey.

Great game, more interesting than TIE, and the Lotus game is really not much more complex (though the sun/moon sorting is annoying).  Still, definitely less friendly for kids and casual folks, but...that's the point, I think.

Unfortunately packaged in an oversized box, and with oversized boards.  Standard square Kosmos/FFG box would've been fine.

RATING: 7.1
I jumped on the bandwagon with this one after one play.  It's abstract strategy bingo number crunching at its best.  The only luck is the number that's called for the tile used.  After that, you make your own bed and lie in it.  Two games in one and mind melting fun, it plays best with lots of players but loses nothing with fewer players.  This one is a bit more involved with a few more options than Take it Easy which makes it more interesting for me.  If you don't have either version, I'd recommend this one over the early edition (Take it Easy) though it costs a few bucks more.

Solitaire, absolutely no interaction, these kind of games I would play on a computer, not as a social board game.

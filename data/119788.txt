This one is dudes-on-a-map in general. The board is a constructed affair of hexagon tiles. You start with your three homeland spots and there are unrevealed contentious tiles in the middle between the players. What's the trick here? Build-a-bag-of-cubes. It's like deck building, but it's building a bag of colored cubes. There's 6 colors in the game and each represents a type of technology (if you will): red is fight, green is move, orange is advance technology, etc. And you have these gauges on your player board which require certain cube colors. On your turn, you have 3 cubes to place. If you fill a gauge, you get to take an action or two. So it's all about gaining more cubes, dropping them in your bag, and starting to build a ratio that works for you. There are additional cards to acquire that have their own gauges - so there's variety there. 

Combat is simple: it's one of the actions you can take. You generate a point of attack and that kills an opponent's guy (or a neutral 'ghost' piece). If you kill more than one from an opponent, you start to rack up victory points.

The game ends when one or more of the end game conditions are achieved by any players. Then you add up points and that's that.

Really, it's very good. It supports up to 6 players, but played great with 3 - and I'd never play it with more than 4 due to the time between turns. It delivers what you'd expect and does it in a very smart way. I heard it compared to Eclipse in that it brought smooth mechanics to a theme-game. Very good comparison I'd say and great point. I'd like to see more of this in the future.

Simple to figure out, hard to master.  Strategy wise and incredibly deep game.  

I have been playing without the fog of war so far.  May have to try it with the fog of war though.  Lately it seems very much the same, but could be I am just bitter because my group has bested me every time we play this game.

Ok but nothing in the game play pushes this in front of similar games.

RATING: 8
Things I like: asymmetric races, luck + luck mitigation, different paths to victory, and allowing for depth after getting through the initial learning curve.

Takes a turn or two to figure out how things work and how to chain actions together, but after that, even first time players should be able to start planning for engine building or future turns.

At clearance price, I feel that this has good value and a lot of replayability.

Downsides to the game are complex endgame scoring (like seven wonders), many moving parts, and the game can be swingy due to luck of the draw with area tiles or starting science cards.  Race powers are also not balanced, which is noticeable after a few plays.

Race balancing allows for a soft handicap when teaching new players (and a challenge to try and make them actually useful) although it's tough to overcome bad area tiles (if one player has two swamp/mountain/forest tiles and other players have regular tiles).

It's weird that I ended up liking Hyperborea a lot more than I thought I would. From the reviews and advertisements, it frankly seemed a bit dull. I bought it on sale and was pleasantly surprised.

This is a nice, cozy little euro game that has elements of area control and "bag-building", which is essentially deckbuilding with far simpler outcomes. What really makes the game shine is the additional actions you can invent for your clan and the asymmetrical player powers. They increase replayability and heavily increase the fun of trying to make specific strategies work. 

Here are some notable things about the game:

• The tiles are a bit drab, though they look a lot better in person than pictures online.
• The minis are cool and the player boards are nice and thick. Overall, the component quality is very satisfactory.
• This game is pretty and bursting with color.
• Deckbuilders usually require you to plan a few turns ahead but this game is much more forgiving while simultaneously allowing you to plan your entire finished bag from the start.
• There are multiple ways to win even though the game is a VP-score game. They could've improved the game to a rating 8 easily right here if they hadn't pulled the same bullshit "hurrdurr whomever has the most wins!" since this game is pretty strategic. It could've had a tiered scoring system like Roll Player so you not only know how well you did, but how you fared compared to previous scores AND what the rulebook considers good.
• The end conditions are a bit annoying, I admit. With some of them being all-pay-bid auctions in the game. No one likes that shit. Stop doing it.

Overall, there's just not a lot negative to say about the game. If you have your eyes set on a particular faction and don't get it, you probably WILL be sad for the rest of the game as they play so differently.

Update 2017: Played the game more and have grown to like it better than previously. It might eventually become an 8. However, some glaring flaws have surfaced regarding the faction abilities:
• One of each of the 2 faction abilities per player is unilaterally better, provably, with math. Every single faction has the equivalent of one less ability, effectiveness-wise.
• Purple has no actually good abilities and both of them tend to prevent you from scoring or doing much of anything.
• Yellow's VP sacrifice ability is absolutely broken. Yellow cannot lose a game with this. You will always replace or even plus the VP you sacrifice and it's UNLIMITED as long as you have VP. This led to insanely long turns with endless chains of actions leading to Yellow winning with DOUBLE the VP of the second place player every time. Even restricting it to once per turn does nothing to stop it. It would need to be house-ruled to be once per bag reset.

Overall, if they could come out with some rules changes to the faction abilities to fix them (like letting Purple's replacement ability work on players and not stop you from scoring ghosts; or making orange's gray sacrifice less terrible) then the game would have significantly more replay value. It actually eats into the nice replay value this game has as an addictive 4X-engine builder.

RATING: 7
An innovative combo of tried-and-true mechanics, with a few original ones tossed in for good measure. A brain-burner, to be sure; but AP isn't much of a problem since you know most of your options for next turn at the end of your current one! And now, the negatives:

-the theme is close to being there, but not quite: it's a cube-pusher, and only a civ-building game in the most fertile of imaginations. Speaking of fertile:

-the art is generally good (especially on the cards), and some of the miniature races look great. The Green Archers, though, when viewed on the game-board, look like American marines storming ashore at Normandy. And the Old Blue Dudes? Well, quite unintentionally on the part of the artist (I hope!), the Old Blue Dudes miniatures look like they've stumbled on the long, lost vault of Viagra. Look at one of them to see what I mean: it's difficult not to notice their...uh, enthusiasm.

-this is the worst game I have ever seen for the colour-blind. It is impossible to be played as produced. Sure, the tech-markers have symbols on them; but those symbols are pretty faint.

Having said all those negatives, Hyperborea is a good game, but only if you don't have the faintest hint of colour-blindness; and even if you can distinguish colours perfectly, you're still going to be struggling at times to figure out what the heck that cube is which you just drew!

I have heard Hyperborea described as Eclipse lite and I can see the similarities.  As in Eclipse there is a concentric arrangement of hex tiles, with the highest value one in the centre.  Eclipse has ancients, Hyperborea has ghosts.  Both games have technologies that make your race more effective.  Hyperborea also develops the deckbuilder/territorial conflict hybrid we first saw in A Few Acres of Snow. Though it throws out the deck and instead has cubes pulled from a bag.  Various combinations of cubes allow you to do different things.  

On early acquaintance, the conflict element feels quite constrained, with players encouraged to view it more as a set collection sub-system (vps aren't scored for killing a second figure from one race until figures of every other race have been killed) than a means to world domination.  I think this gets to the heart of my disappointment with Hyperborea.  Despite Ameritrashy appearances, it is an optimization game that tells a pretty poor story and then just fizzles out when certain vp conditions are met.   

Production quality is good.  My only quibbles are about hard to distinguish reds and mauves and a poorly designed box insert.  The artwork is pleasing.  The rules are messily organised.

RATING: 5.5
Wow, this felt like a ruthless bag builder - ruthless in that if you miscounted your cubes in your bag or mistimed something, you got wrecked. Not being able to trigger the actions when you want or to save up incomplete actions (per the revised rules) made this very difficult in my mind.

This is a modern eurotrash boardgamegalaxy. In essence it is a miniature area control game with variable player powers and random board setup. It uses a deck building mechanic with dice instead of cards. Don't expect a highly thematic game though. On the other hand, the game has many paths to follow and technologies to research. It plays in a reasonable amount of time and has great components and artwork.

Hyperborea hit the market promising a great euro-trash hybrid experience (or at least that was the expectation of many, based on the marketing)... did it deliver?

Yes and no, I'd say.

The game has the components (and box cover...) of a Dudes-on-a-map game, but at its heart has a very euroish engine: deckbuilding (even in the "bagbuilding" iteration) is hardly an ameritrash mechanic. And I imagine this has definitely not helped the game in its early days among gamers...

I am more of a cube pusher, and I did my research before buying, so I knew what to expect. Did it deliver for me? Almost...

I am quite fascinated by the idea behind the game, I found the rules promising, and gameplay very appealing (all the possible combos make my brain excited)... So I enjoy the game a lot, but I feel something is missing: the "finale" in my first game felt a little anti-clymatic... The game lets you build an very cool engine and, in a way, it sparks a story arc. But it suddenly ends before that story arc reaches its end.

This is merely a feeling, and hopefully it will change after a few more plays (because I definitely want to play it again), but was definitely there.

By the way, components are great: thick cardboard, great plastic sculpts, fancy artwork. I didn't really get what naysayers say about lacking components (the I noticed the game as a MSRP of 59€ in Europe, but an astonishing price point of 99$ in the US, and I quite understood...).

Hybrid dudes on a map game with strong euro leanings. Lots of different strategies available but seems a bit characterless. Just lacking that special something. Comparable to Kemet and Cyclades but not as good as either. Mechanics are interesting with the cube bag but make for a slow moving game. Would benefit from repeated plays but not going to get them from my group.

Initial Impression: I enjoy games that use the deck building mechanism, provided that's not the only mechanism in the game. This game uses the mechanism, along with a few others, to provide a 4x civ-building experience. The game itself is fun and there are many decisions presented to the players each turn. One aspect that I find particularly interesting is the concept of resetting, where the players' bags are reseeded and all workers become available again. Timing this phase becomes very important, similar in a fashion, to The Manhattan Project, and adds yet another decision point to the game. One question the game left me wondering was what the cubes represented. Maybe the rulebook explains this? Overall, it's a fun game that I would play again.

Ahhhh Hyperborea, the game that brought us bag building. Yes, Orleans does this mechanic better. But this is quite fun as well. Needing to fill up a row with cubes before performing the action really ramps up the tension. Combat is incredibly straightforward, I am in the same hex as you and activate my combat line, you die. There is a nice exploration feel as well as hexes get turned over and you see what kind of cool effect each one has or which ruins they will have. This game was severely underrated, IMO. I need to get the expansion at some point.

After the first game, you can knock out a game in 1.5 to 2.5 hours with 4 players.  Avoids kingmaking to a large extent by locking down your troops in ruins and cities, especially when combined with terrain effects and the randomness of the cube draw.  The point-salad also makes it difficult to be sure who is winning.  I really appreciate that, unless you draw the right cubes and have troops that are free to move (i.e. have not been committed to cities or ruins), players cannot just freely bash the perceived leader.

To keep it simple, we basically play without Diplomacy, and we have a slight preference to play without any faction-specific tiles or abilities.



"There is the option, that I would seriously recommend to players worried about balance, to play without faction powers, and maybe (to preserve the differentiation between factions) with each player picking one extra technology out of three random from decks I, II or III - the deck matching the color of the player pieces, of course."

Alternative diplomacy fix:

For what it is worth, I have played with the the following adjustment for Diplomacy:

"Each adjacent opponent draws 1 cube; Diplomacy owner draws 1 cube more than the total number of cubes drawn by all opponents up to a maximum of 3."

A few things that can be over-looked:
1) Each player starts with a 7th cube of their chosen color.
2) You can only activate one set of technologies on a given basic tech section (once a cube is placed on one, the other is locked out).
3) Movement from two different terrain tiles (out of mountain, into forest) would cost 3 movement points.

NOTE: you CANNOT reactivate technologies by destroying and replacing a cube.
(Wait, you can, just not with Alchemy: 
as specified at pag 13 of the rulebook: "in the case a player removes a cube to gain a different cube, this new cube is positioned in place of the removed cube".
So when you activate alchemy you are simply changing the color of one cube, you are not generating a cube inside your bag.
This change of color do not triggers that technology again so basically if you are activating alchemy changing blue for blue you are simply drawing one cube from your bag (and you are allowed to do it).

If you are removing a cube instead with technology effects (like corruption or technical improvements) or ruins you are allowed to remove a cube from one technology and reactivate it with one of your available cubes.)

Alchemy is the exception in that it swaps a cube into the same position, but it does not reactivate the technology.

A 4X or civ-type game - one of many but for a couple of key differences. Most importantly is the cube placing mechanic (not to be confused with worker placement) which produce effects depending on what combination of colours is employed. While moving your units and expanding your empire is the object, everything requires the generation of effects (movement, combat, building, researching advanced technologies, and so on). You start with one cube of each of six colours in your bag from which you draw three each turn to work with. There are ways to get more cubes and you can decide which colours you want to predominate. Each player has access to a number of "basic technologies" but can obtain "advanced technologies" which can deliver some powerful effects when activated by applying the right number and colour of cubes. Advanced techs also come with grey cubes (waste) which are generally unusable and plug up your bag, but there are ways around that as well.

It is all about accumulating VPs via direct effects, controlling territory, killing opponent's units, accumulating more cubes, and points for advanced techs. Managing your "cube economy" is the focus as the means to outpoint your rivals. The closest comparison in terms of "feel" I can come up with is "Mage Knight: The Boardgame" but MK uses cards and a form of deck-building while Hyperborea uses coloured cubes so you are "cube-building" rather than deck building. In each game you start your turn by plucking a number of cubes from your bag (three initially). From there it is a bit of a puzzle how best to use the specific cubes you've been dealt in the most effective way.

This type of approach to managing your resources can be intriguing or frustrating depending on your taste in such things. I enjoyed the first play of this game but recognize that there is a learning curve to be negotiated in order to unlock the full experience. So far it appears to be well developed and engaging, but we certainly noticed some confusion resulting from the colour registration - particularly telling red from purple and blue from green (cubes and cards). We played with the full complement of six players and there was some downtime as we groped our way through our first play (we completed the "short" game in about three hours). The flow of play will certainly improve with familiarity, but it may be that four players is the sweet spot here.

So far I am very impressed and am looking forward to future playings.

In Hyperborea, you're drawing cubes from a bag, and taking actions based on those colors of cubes.  You'll spawn new guys, move your guys on the map, attack opponents, upgrade your abilities, find relics that do various things, etc, scoring points along the way.  You draw a certain number of cubes each turn, and when your bag is out of cubes, you perform a "reset", meaning the cubes go back in your bag and your characters on the map become available again (they lock into place when you use them for certain things).

The gimmick of the cube bag is really clever, as you get to customize your bag toward the abilities you intend to use more often.  There's also a great balance, as more cubes in your bag score you more points at the game end, but more cubes also mean a longer time between your resets, and you'll need those resets in order to take desirable actions again.

The game built around the gimmick felt decent but not that exciting, and I often felt like I was just going through the motion once I got my bag of cubes the way I had wanted it.  So, overall, the game felt really unique in it's core mechanism, but not all that fresh as a whole.

Essen SPIEL 2014

THE new concept at Essen 14: bag building. Well executed in this one. While it's no perfect game, it is very much fun to play.

__

Update: after repeated play, it shows that each and every gameplay are always very similar, thus getting uninteresting. Sold.

*5* (Initial plays)
Not impressed. It seems like a great idea and fun to play, but in reality kinda boring. The bag builder was more random and difficult than anticipated. I had several turns where I couldn't do the actions I wanted. The player interaction was depressing. Overall, something I don't need to play anymore, would much rather play Orleans for a bag builder.

I love this game. A refreshing mix of hand (really cube) management with "dudes on a map". You get a "race" at the start of the game which is really of the warrior, archer, wizard variety-each with a unique special power. You also have a bag of cubes where your turn is to pull 3 and see what actions you can do with the cubes (move, recruit, attack, advance, etc...). There are some really cool management aspects to it, because you can choose when to add more cubes to your bag (advance actions can grant this ability) so trying to avoid a dreaded one/two cube turn, or forcing a certain color out presents some fun timing decisions. And knowing the colors in your bag lets you plan out a series of turns, just the timing of when the actions pop is random, which is fun when your dudes are trying to race for stuff on the map with other players. Besides that, there is a fun rule to prevent beating up on one person and special power cards and an overall race to certain end game conditions. The game play is extremely snappy and the game plays a lot quicker than you think it should. Great, great game.

The bag building is definitely interesting and really makes you think about what cubes you have, but also what cubes others have. We played the medium length game and even though I was pinned in from moving easily I still wound up losing on the tiebreaker so it is clear multiple strategies can work. My problem is primarily the length as the more rounds you go the more thought is involved every round. I'd really only like to play the short game.

Very novel game. I really enjoy drawing the cubes and trying to make the best of them and managing garbage cubes. This lives in a very good level of complexity for me with decisions to make, but not needing to decipher tons of odd symbols or reference charts. I need to play this more.

Likes: The exploration; the unique starting powers of the six civilizations; the technology development system, which opens new worker placement possibilities; the cube-drawing mechanism, which calls on your memory skills and forces you to manage your pulls

Dislikes: The long setup and tear-down; the huge amount of cardboard; too many exceptions to rules that are too easy to forget; tricky iconography can sometimes be interpreted multiple ways; long game is too long

Bottom line: A solid game that will be a hit for those who like heavily themed memory games (e.g. me)

Bag building to me removes one of the biggest gripes of deck building: incessant shuffling. (You there, surreptitious card fondler. Yes, you. Out.) Shuffling is done by a simple jiggle, done. Another positive aspect is that there are only six (well, actually seven) colours of cubes to draw from the bag, and that combinations of colours actually make up the actions. So your 'deck' tends to vary from turn to turn. Unfortunately that is also a disadvantage as planning in this game gets a stake of coloured wood through its heart. You can make certain combinations more likely, but it is chaotic physics which eventually decides what appears when. This puts Hyperborea firmly in Quantum-country. The artwork is different; there are no dice; and the subject is different... but it is still dudes on a map moving things around based on semi-randomly generated events; stressing tactics rather than strategies; and using a slightly gimmicky but admittedly novel driving mechanism. This is apparently sufficient cause to release a new game...

A game which, I should add, costs a maddening €55 and doesn't even look the part. The colourful box art doesn't really make it into the game, unless you count the horrible thin minis which were probably included to seduce gamers to part with their hard-earned cash. Seriously, replace the damn things with octogons and make the basegame a lot cheaper; then release minis for those with a minis fondling fetish, or those who need minis for 'thematic immersion'. (Dude/ss, you're moving markers around on coloured card board.)

I'm not going to cling too much to my first impressions save what I wrote above. Suffice to say that I did not yet purchase the game because it was way too expensive for what it offered. I hope I get a retry in the future, though. That said... although I avoid deck building like the plague, I have picked up enough noise about one of its pitfalls—deck thinning—to recognise immediately that the discussion about removing cubes from partially completed techs or not, is precisely a discussion about thinning. It is very worrying that 'stress testing' by the authors led to adjustments precisely in this area. Irrespective of these changes being warranted or not, when a central mechanism is adjusted after the game has gone to press, my Bad-Feeling-O-Meter™ starts to wobble in a dangerously worrying fashion. And [url=https://thurotdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/6-imbalanced-obv.jpg]this[/url] is just stupid.

I am not yet really sure about my rating after only one game and only having read parts of the rules myself. I have a feeling my rating might actually go up after more games.

I found the complexity of the game too overwhelming in the first game and I am unsure if for me it is worth the effort of investing more time to explore it. But it might actually be! :) The game might actually become really interesting when being more familiar with its mechanism and its cards.

I like it a lot that the game offers an incentive to try to fight somewhat equally against all opponents and not concentrate on some or one of them. See my 8th general preference about gaming in my profile. But because the incentive only partly mitigates the problem, this general preference is also a main reason Hyperborea probably won't rise among my very most favorite games.

I like the [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2015/variable-player-powers]Variable Player Powers mechanic[/url] of the game. (See my 11th general preference about gaming.)

A euro civilization game. You win the game by scoring points by collecting gems, killing ghosts, killing other players, developing advanced technologies, developing one's civilization in general (= collecting coloured cubes), reaching certain objectives and controlling territories.
Each turn a player draws 3 cubes which are allocated to one or more base and/or advanced technologies. This triggers a set of actions.
Replayability is guaranteed by the set of hexagonal map tiles (1 central used out of 6, 6 borderland tiles out of 30), the double sided homeland tiles, the set of 72 ruin tokens (number used depends on the tiles drawn and the number of homelands), the 64 advanced technology cards and the 2 faction tiles of which only 1 can be used.

Lots of symbology to pick up. Good quality components from the miniatures, cards, cubes, bags, and cardboard tiles.

4x gameplay but quick to play once the bag mechanism is understood. Tech tree doesn't really exist and the card offer is random (read: tactical).

Pasted on generic fantasy theme and very little room for negotiation or politics. No trading.

Rewards planning though the bag contents are relatively straightforward so the game doesn't seem that deep once the rules complexity is understood.

Some reservations on start player imbalanced powers and swingy tech offer.

[2016-08-26 - First Impression]
First things first: I liked Hyperborea more than I thought I would. It has a nice puzzly feel to it and the fighting isn't (yet) as prevalent as I thought it would be. The fighting aspect might be more of a turn-off with more games, but I'm not sure I'll ever reach this point of experience. Why is that? Well, there are a few things that really keep this game from hitting the table more. 
One is the rules. There are a lot of them and the rule book really isn't that great at teaching them. It felt unorganized and made learning the game a real chore even if it's explained to you by someone else. Then there a some parts of the rules that aren't as clear as they should be so that I always have the feeling we're playing something wrong.
Another thing is that this game is really complex. There are a lot of things to consider and not doing so will result in wasted turns. In order to prevent this from happening, you have to really think about what you're doing and guess what, this leads to a lot of AP. So, in order to get better, you should play it more often but that doesn't happen with my group because the learning games just take too long.
All in all, I would like to revisit this game a few more times to get a clearer picture of the game play, but I'm not sure if this will happen.
To sum this first impression up: If I would have to rate it right now, I would give it a 6. But this rating might swing either way.

As quoted from BGG rating system: 4 - Not so good, it doesn't get me but could be talked into it on occasion.

Game as advertised (at least visually) shows me a bunch of fantasy races characters with mountain world, weapons, action.

Game is nothing like this. It is a celebration of just a cube bag mechanic, it's functional ability to balance itself, to create a harmonic engine with only itself (not reality or fantasy tale in this instance) and produce a game that does not punish poor performance (at least obviously) rather allow poor performance to feel it has a chance.

Very cool action system, that seems promising. Just not in this game shell. The action system is fine on it's own, promising even. Still one of the best games of it's type (4X). Its pretty fun, it looks great, but in the end, poorly designed.

Terribly unbalanced design, but at least its long. Arbitrary king maker design, but the broken game mechanics should still allow for someone to run away with the game if they lean on them correctly.

We probably discussed the flaws of the game for four hours. There doesn't seem much balance in the factions. Blue and Yellow, they both just get free turns, which yields extra free turns. Orange and Green are super awful, with little to no extra power.  The orange color is actively bad (other then being usable for spy techs), it's just worse then worthless. Our best solution was to place it on one of the orange actions and never take it off, never completing the action.

The 'Deck building' Aspect of this game is a joke. You actually ideally would remove cubes from your bag, so you can get your 'Free' city actions to reset faster. The best solution is to leave cubes on some of the substandard actions (of which there are many) so you don't have to redraw them. 

The spy techs are also broken, they make all other techs, actually actively bad. The best fix we could come up for was to remove them from the game.

The game actually has built in mechanics to benefit a runaway leader. You can't just attack them for points, since you have to kill everyone first. If they drop below their starting pieces, they just get them back, so you can't invade their homeland. If a player is playing all their cubes every turn, they get additional actions from the cities and ruins they can control.

It seems impossible to beat a competent blue player. They build techs easier, and they draw more cubes, which means they can cycle through their bag faster, meaning they get additional free actions from cities. This was readily apparent from the first play, but subsequent plays showed the blue player achieving 2 end game conditions before any other player was close to one.

The yellow player can follow a similar path, and might actually be slightly faster, but they will generate one less point each time they cycle, but gain a cube.

All other factions are substandard, the Green and Orange both being just exceptionally bad.

I guess you could play without the faction bonuses and spies, and generic starting locations to try to make the game better.

The bag-building system of adding cubes to your bag so as to increase your chances of drawing certain action cubes has a mild appeal but it felt like they ran out of ideas after that. The game is mostly players optimizing their own action cube situation and then there's some bland interaction on the board (you move adjacent and attack).

Holey crap this game is F.U.N. Don't use the "Race War" variant with unique player abilities, it's NOT balanced. If you overlook that one thing, man it's on! Excellent euro style play but with enough theme to still immerse yourself in the world. At least for me, anyway. I think most players should focus on two strengths that complement each other, using the races as mental archetypes and thematic guides. Will you be merchant rangers, secretly damaging your opponents' position with poisoned arrows from afar while making backroom deals to rule from the shadows? Will you find glory in technological marvels and the efficiency they bring? Or perhaps you're priestess of a tribe of warrior zealots who live to fight and spread like fire across new lands. It's up to you! There's a lot of palette to paint with!

A bag-building game somehow like Orleans. Nice artwork and the conpenents are in good quantity,but these haven't make  the game outstanding.I prefer Orleans much more.Both this and Orleans are lack of intereactions,but this one is boring because of the explorations in the early period of the game.What's good is the combo,but a little too much when someone haven't consider well how to make his play.What's more,the factions are not very balanced,perhaps there will be some expensions in the future.
Overall,if you already have Orleans,do not buy tihs one unless you like the art or the background  stories.

I really enjoyed this quirky game. 
Different coloured cubes in different combinations allow you to take different actions. You build up what cubes are available in your bag thus pushing your 'deck' towards the strategy you wish to achieve.

It didn't really feel very much like a civilasation building game but it was very very quick , approx 20 mins per player, and to be honest that felt about right. 
There are plenty of ways to score victory points, add cubes to your bag and gain additional actions you can perform all in all really really enjoyed this one and I am looking forward to many more games.

As a side note, the factions are not the most balanced, green seems quite underpowered and yellow very very overpowered (indeed we double and triple checked the rules book for clarification as it was simply much better than the rest of the factions). We are even considering a house rule for this

RATING: 4.5
Very preliminary rating, and I have mixed feelings about rating it this early.  On the one hand, I give it high marks for ambition and creativity. On the other, I agree with a lot of the negative comments I've read, including:

Generally felt under-developed and the forums have been alive with many serious rules issues.
Over-produced/expensive for what it delivers.
Downtime, although I can see this getting much better with familiarity.
Balance questions.  Blue seems to have a serious advantage for example.
Certain techs appear extremely powerful --reusing actions for example, and there doesn't seem to be any self-balancing mechanism for cost of tech.
The 'reset' mechanism is kind of arbitrary in that you may get one-third  your normal turn (possible to mitigate).
Uses a lot of map/action ideas from Eclipse (is that bad?).
Art is dark and symbols are not intuitive.

That said, I would play it again simply for the novelty of the mechanics.  Building actions is appealing for a civ game, even if it doesn't grab me for how well it's implemented. I did find the overall experience lacking, but I felt like it could inspire a better implementation of this idea down the road.   I could easily recommend this game as something to try because of the new action mechanic.

Update: played again without race powers.  Game had better balance.  Overall, it didn't really come together and still feels under-developed.

This is a fantasy-themed 4X game with deckbuilding elements. It sounds really crazy when you say that, but the game works really well.

There are a few things that could stand to be clearer in the rulebook, and the language is occasionally a bit on the clunky end - but the game itself is worth working through the hiccups.

The real surprise of Essen 2014.
A brilliant and original game with an interesting story and some innovative mechanics. Simple but deeply strategic, this is one of my favourite games.

I suggest to try several games because the different races offer a wide range of options and different strategies.

May the power of cubes be with you !

I like the mechanics and the resource management aspect of this game. There is an element of area control, although it isn't the main focus of the game. No dice involved, and you have the option of starting with the "fog of war" over the board (which I recommend). 
I think there is a high replay ability factor here, due to the sheer number of tiles you randomly draw from to create the game board. Each faction has 2 different faction abilities, you choose one at setup, this allows you to play 12 times without playing the same faction+ability combo again. 
These abilities, contrary to what i've heard before, are fairly well balanced. Never did i feel that my ability put me at either a massive advantage or disadvantage compared to others, they did however shape my game play tactics.
Also the different tech cards you can buy allow you to further customize your ability and game play. 

Overall, not particularly inspired, but still a solid euro game.

I would hesitate to play this with people who take a looong time to decide their actions on their turn.

Love the programming of your actions, really good idea (drawing 3 cubes, set them in the actions you are planning and play with the timing of the "reset"). However, feel that the game lacks something. Have the feeling that cards and tokens are too powerful, if you get the good combo of cards (with influence of some luck) you will be far ahead in scoring

I'm sure I must have played a dozen games just like this. Big box full of plastic minis with a lush piece of fantasy art on the cover. Twenty minutes for a rules explanation where I take on board just enough to get by on. I finish up several hours later with no sense that I've made any sort of clever decisions. My main objective is to try not to spoil the experience for the other players. I certainly didn't hate this game (or the dozen or so other games like it), I like spending time with my group, but as a game on its own merit I can't rate it highly. Only fair to note we played with 5 all new players (I suspect it is best with 3 or 4) and got some minor rules wrong. Oct 2014

RATING: 7.5
Interesting game of combos, optimization of one's moves among many opportunities. Strategical options require to keep into close consideration the amount and quality of the cubes that are being drawn and put into your bag. Further plays will tell if this is a winner, as for now, with 6 players there was some significant downtime between plays.

RATING: 7
The consensus about some player powers being unbalanced really holds me back here. I've loved playing it (fast turns, interesting choices, some area control, some of Dominion's "just pick a thing and do it as much as you can, the game will be over soon" strategy exploration) but I do worry it would fall apart if I looked too closely. Those ruin tiles are very random, for one thing.

Making attack powers necessary to use any of the board (because cities and ruins always begin with neutral units defending them) is a stroke of genius, particularly for a 2p game. An opponent building up military is no longer telegraphing that they're coming for you-- you still need to figure out whether it's worth it to them, and what you want to defend.

Would make it a 10 if it weren't a bit longer than the box states (I would say it's 30-35 minutes per player) and if the rules were a bit clearer.  Love the cube draw/allocation mechanic and the variability in strategy and race strengths.  The components/bits/figures/cards are great quality and beautiful.   Expect to take longer than you think to play through, especially your first times playing and if you play with people would really like to consider each turn's actions carefully.

RATING: 7
Gain and draw colored cubes from your bag to fill various rows in your player board and activate actions. I like it that this "bag building" serves a sort of "dudes on a map" game (unlike the dry spreadsheet gameplay of "Orléans"). Actions allow you to place and move troops, attack ghosts and other players, help gain more cubes, or acquire cards that grant additional actions. You can also use benefits from cities and ruins, but these just require a troop.

The game is overall quite enjoyable, although it takes too long and feels underdeveloped. The area control part of the scoring seems forced, as you seldom have more than one miniature in the same hexagon. I haven't played it or analyzed it enough to be sure about the unbalance in special powers that others have mentioned, but it can also be caused by the random map setup.

The production is very nice, with great artwork and different miniatures for each faction, but the game was ridiculously overpriced when it was released - so much that the publisher significantly reduced the price later.

RATING: 6.5
Hm, where to start? First off, it's an interesting game and I like how it works in general, specially the conflicts. However, the actions felt pretty boring and even though there are plenty of them, most do the same, just in a different mix. The cubes out of the bag add a good amount of luck to the game that can be frustrating and which is done better in "Orleans", since you have more control over your bag and actions.

Then comes the huge amount of downtime that hurts this game A LOT. If this was done in 90 mins. it would be great, but it's far from that. Also, I'm not sure about the balance of the factions, but it would take more plays to get to a conclusion (and you can still just ignore them, though).

To sum it up... interesting game, but with flaws, some small, some bigger. Even though I miss the interaction in "Orleans", I still prefer that one, as it runs much faster and more smooth.

Strange hybrid game mostly with euro mechanics. The game has a very uniqe theme which is enough to try it alone. I don't know if the faction's special powers are well balanced or not but the game was very tight in the end. Managing the colored cubes are the key factor of winning it, but be aware because it is one of the biggest brain burners i have ever played. Im prety sure that repeted gameplay would open up more strategies, but the rules are too complicated to buy it to my own collections.

Pros / Cons:
-Very good deep strategy with managing the colored cubes.
-Solid uniqe theme. Just because it im interested to play the game a few more.

-Too complicated rules to buy it for my own collection.
-Very expensive for what it is.

Great bits, neat mechanics, fun game.

Not convinced that the different factions are entirely balanced.  There appeared to be some faction special abilities that were just unfair.  Maybe we don't have all the experience that the developers did, but I felt like some more play-testing would have smoothed out some of the imbalances a bit better.

There appears to be some errata bouncing around with ways to correctly balance some abilities . . .

Jeu de block que j'ai bien aimé.  Je pensais qu'il y avait plus d'asymétrie dans le jeu mais c'est un des premiers que j'ai acheté. Joué environ 3 fois le flow est un peu sacadé mais ça passe bien.  Le pire c'est quand tes en rupture trop loin de ton coin là c'est assez dure de reprendre du poil de la bête.

J'aurais aimé un peu plus de pouvoirs que les deux sur la carte de la faction mais on en ramasse dans les cartes de technologie.  Je ne suis pas trop fan de compter mes petits cubes tout le temps et c'est pas des skittles donc n'essayer pas d'avoir toute l'arc-en-ciel dans votre poche car il sera difficile de bien garder le focus et de broyer du noir.

Bag-building, technology acquisition, creating combos, and stringing together surprisingly long turns all worked better than expected. To balance that, the territorial part of the game seemed to contain lots of potential for arbitrary screwage and kingmaking.

4 games: I like it a lot. Really a lot. There were however critical mutterings in the club today from my opponents, so the question is how easy it will be to get it to the table in the future.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (December 2015)

I wasn’t expecting much from Hyperborea. I have heard it was a bad game and I also have seen it severely discounted over the last couple of months, however I was pleasantly surprised by it and now it is a keeper in my game collection.

It is a big box full of great components. The miniatures are very well done and each player has different models. The art is great, from the box to the tiles. Overall, great production values.

Hyperborea is a bag building game, the first of its kind I played and I LOVED this mechanism. It is better than deck building (due to the constant shuffling) and way better than dice building (because there is no luck, in these games you can always roll bad even though you made sound strategic decisions). Now I want to try more bag building games (Orleans is next).

I like the fantasy theme but it isn’t a thematic game. The playtime feels too short (too much to do before game ending), so I recommend you play at least the medium game. I hope to play the long game soon.

Hyperborea has very interesting and non-obvious decisions (what cube do I buy, what technology do I buy, what actions do I do, where to move/expand, who to attack, do I bring more soldiers to the table?). I feel there is a lot to explore here.

The game supports up to 6 players but I’m not sure this is the way to play it. For now, I feel it is best with 4 players, with more, the downtime can be excessive.

I’m not sure if the races are balanced, but I prefer to play it this way. With more plays I will analyze this point.

The name of the game is kind of weird, it makes me think of Conan the Barbarian, also the  prefix “Hyper” seems weird used as a game name in this way (it doesn´t make sense to me).

Bottom line, I really liked the game. I have it on my list of games to play more and its rating can go even higher inmy personal ratings. A keeper in my game collection. It is my kind of "dudes on a map" game.

I continue to love Hyperborea, however I read the rulebook and I was appalled to see how bad we played it the first couple of times. Then I learned that the designers released a FAQ that literally says things like “Page 10: RESET: paragraph 4 is eliminated” and that seems unbelievable to me (we played it correctly because the game explainer read the FAQ before our first play). A FAQ should clarify the rules, not add new rules or remove old rules! (The FAQ changes many core rules). The rulebook is never a strong suit of these designers. With Al Rashid, they also did an abysmal work in that department (but the game is solid). I heavily dislike when core rules are changed after the game is released, it seems playtesting was poorly done (but Hyperborea is a good game and a keeper for me).

Changing the subject, I now have played with different player´s powers and it seems some of them are very unbalanced. Even among the same race, one of the powers is clearly better than the other. That saddens me a bit.

Lots of fun, and stunning to look at. Combat is a little boring and the board is smaller than one would expect; also, much of the game happens on the player-board and off the map. However, once you stop trying to make this into a 4x game and play it for what it is, it works great.

One flaw is female representation - that there is only one female faction and it's power is "Birth".  This kept the game on my wishlist for ages, but I eventually got a second hand copy in trade, because the game is indeed very good.

RATING: 6
The fad bag building meets dudes-on-a-map in Hyperborea. The mechanism is known from the rightfully more popular Orleans. Each turn, a number of cubes is drawn from the bag and placed on the player board to trigger some actions. These actions either revolve around offensive actions of placing dudes, moving them, attacking or constructive actions of adding cubes to the bag and purchasing powerful action cards. Contrary to Orleans, the bag is only refilled once all cubes are drawn.

This dichotomy demonstrates Hyperborea's claim to unite Euro planning with thematic conflict. I'm not convinced that this approach makes sense and Hyperborea is another proof. The mechanisms offer plenty potential for differentiation. Focus on bag-building, focus on the board. Develop unique combinations of abilities by acquiring cards. In the end, the best constructive approaches will be undone on the board if they neglect military might. Kingmaking is a potential problem.

My main problem with Hyperborea is underdevelopment. Some positions on the board can be entered for free with the dudes granting powerful special bonuses. When refilling the bag, these positions become available again. Unsurprisingly, thinning the bag content to refresh as often as possible is a main strategy. Surprisingly, the authors didn't see the potential for abuse and had to modify a core refreshment rule. Incomplete sets of cubes now have to be removed as well. Not detecting such obvious blunders in development constitutes a major warning sign. The resulting unsatisfying bag-building exercise, the odd position claiming and the nonsensical game end execution reduce my interest in further plays.

New in Shrink.  Relatively unique bag-building mechanic.  A few balance issues (blue is much stronger overall), but this game has kept my gaming group quite entertained during multiple sessions.  Modular board and other factors that add a lot of replayability.  While it takes a while to play (3 hrs or so), I'm always left with a sad feeling when it ends, as it always feels like there was so much more I wanted to do and that I wanted to keep playing -- that "one more turn" feeling from computer games like Civ.

I would give it a 10 if the asymmetry as described in the rulebook for the various factions worked and were balanced.  they are not... so we have used alternate abilities but it has never panned out perfectly.  To be honest I prefer the version wherein all players have the same ability.

Regardless, it is such a fun fascinating game that you forget the silly bag building aspect and realize it is an economic game with 30% attacking and 30% area control.  Has a flavor all its own.

Very cool game where your resources quickly get out of hand and all your carefully laid plans are destroyed. Most often by yourself ex. by striving for efficient 3-cube turns and thus fill your bag with shite you don't need.
A bummer this hasn't been all that well received.

Also, a short game is really short. I'd suggest going for 2 objectives at least.

Engine-building, bag-building, exploration,  area control game with asymmetric sides. Games are quick-ish (three, two-player games in four hours). Turns are also usually quick, though some can take longer due to AP. Lots of advanced technology cards, five factions and variable map setup ensure tons of replayability. Like most euros, there's a lot of multiplayer solitaire but the area control means there is some interaction.  There's a lot to like here and not much to dislike, one of my favorites.

Rating for the long game/faction war. Would not recommend the short game. In the long game the balancing of the cards is better and the ending does not feel abrupt.

Reduced rating by 2 points because of the horrible color choice. I (and many people i played the game with) had a hard time to distinguish some colors. For anyone interested in buying the game i would recommend to check the components before.

Hard to know how to classify this one - 4X or civ builder? Works as a little bit of both, and despite the number of bits is fairly streamlined and easy to teach. Seems good with any number though downtime will be an issue with more players. The bag-building aspect leads to interesting choices for your long term strategy.

Set in a mythical land of the same name, Hyperborea is a light civilization game for 2 to 6 players that takes 20-25 minutes per player. The game begins at the time when the magic barrier protecting access to the mythical continent of Hyperborea suddenly falls.

Each player takes the role of the leader of a small kingdom situated just outside the now open to be conquered and explored land. Her kingdom has limited knowledge of housing, trade, movement, warfare, research, and growth, but new and exciting powers are hidden in Hyperborea. During the game, this kingdom will grow in numbers and raise armies, extend its territory, explore and conquer, learn new technologies, etc...

The game's main mechanism, which can be described as "bag-building", involves you building a pool of "civilicubes". Each cube represents specializations for your kingdom: war, trade, movement, building, knowledge, growth. Grey cubes represent corruption and waste, and players will acquire them by developing new technologies. (Power corrupts by its own definition, and the more complex a society becomes, the more waste it generates.) Each turn, players draw three random cubes from their bags, then use them to activate knowledge (technologies) they own.

This game is so long and boring. It feels like if while walking in the street, you have to solve a puzzle each time you make a step.

So it suffer from the do something to do something to do something. If you have somebody who spend too much time thinking, it adds huge downtime to the game.

There are also imbalance issues of some special powers with can be avoided by not using them (Which is what we did). Broken tech cards could also be reshuffled or removed from the deck.

But the most annoying thing is that on one turn, when all you cities are not used, you are going to have a lot of actions 3 - 5 actions in average which make it a very interesting turn to play as you can make various combinations. Then for the next 2-4 turns, you are going to make in average 1.5 action, which makes the game drag forever and give no sense of progress. So it feels like: Fun-Boring-Boring-Boring, then Fun-Boring-Boring-Boring.

A quick fix could be to draw 5 cubes at a time instead of 3 and start with 9 cubes (6 color + 3 color)  instead of 7. It would average out the pace of the game, would allow more action per turns and make you refill your pouch more often.

I really enjoy the first 95% of this game.  The final 5%, I'm not totally sure about.  It can have the potential of analysis paralysis ending once someone triggers the end.  Maybe it was the simple/basic game version.  I need to play this more than once to get a better idea if I want this or not.

RATING: 8
After 10 plays I continue to enjoy this game.  We've been exploring the "Race" game lately and the score differential between last and first has been considerable as people are learning how to counter the special abilities of each race.  Six player games are cut-throat and feels like a knife fight in a phone booth as there is very little space to maneuver after the first round or two.  Also wish they would have included a couple more end game conditions to give a bit more variety to the game (perhaps one could be having the majority on a certain number of tiles or having captured one or each opponent's pawns). 

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Bag building game involving accumulation of 6 different colors of cubes which are used to carry out various actions, usually in combination with other cubes.  This is quite the interesting game with quite a few different ways to score and what appears at first glance at least to have quite a few different methods to obtain victory.  I'd recommend at least the medium game to get a good feel the game and would recommend the full game if possible.  This has strong potential to be a pretty mean game of taking out opposing dudes but this doesn't feel overly horrendous as you always go back to three dudes on the map (although you do have to start at your capital city which can be a pain).  Game is relatively simple to play although there are a fair bit of options to pursue.  

I do wish they would have included a nice player aid for the different symbols but that can easily be printed up and remedied at least.  I do wish I didn't have to wait another 2 months before acquiring my copy of the game!

+ Nice drawings, clear iconography, very decent miniatures, thick cardboard. Nice. 
- Turns are a bit long: we need to decide where to play on our board by studying a few combinations of where our three cubes can go, and then do the action. This added layer of combination matching (which placement of the cubes matches our priority?) is both a bit long and is more of a small basic combinatorial problem than something I am looking for in a game (executing what I want directly and naturally without some more puzzly, non-game mechanical device).
- Not much theme or flavor, compared to Kemet, Inis or Clockwork Wars.

I like this one a bunch. It's a little bit of Dudes on a Map, a little bit of Civ, a little bit of "deck" building. The bag-building thing is interesting, and a lot tougher to do well than it appears. There are also a bunch of ways to approach the game without it feeling like everything you do gets you points. What's more, the game is super easy to learn and plays briskly. Definitely one I want more of.

RATING: 8
Has become a group favorite, and for good reason.  Combines eurogame, area of control, war/conflict, engine building, and exploration.  Probably my favorite part is that the engine building allows you to make, with the different technologies, totally different types of engines.  That is what makes it an awesome game.

The other aspects it pulls off reasonably well.  The scoring is a bit of a point salad and this isn't oozing with theme.  And there are several niggling rules that are hard to keep track of, but after 2-3 plays that got better.  This is definitely a game you don't want to play once, then a year goes by before you play it again...you would forget everything that way.

This wouldn't be the most rules-elegant game out there at all, but it accomplishes a lot--it's the fact that it blends so many things you can do together so well that is impressive.

We all really enjoy playing it and look forward to trying out new strategies every time.  That's what proves that this is a great game.

Initial Impressions (short game with no special abilities): This game sits in a weird place. On one hand the set up time for all the "chrome", the long downtime between turns, the supposedly imbalanced abilities, the direct conflict, and one end condition that seems really really difficult to do make this game too Ameritrash to be a Euro. On the other, the very watered down and set collection aspect of the combat, that you can generate a pretty bland VP engine, and the cube building aspect makes it too Euro to be anywhere near the Ameritrash the cover of the box shows it to be. However, I think this game still may have a niche in my collection in the same vein as Thunderstone: a game that attempts to combine two previously mutually exclusive things a deckbuilder with a 4x (a deck builder and a dungeon crawler for Thunderstone), and in doing so creates a mangled chimera that is certainly flawed but until it is surpassed holds a place in this hobby. As a 4x, this game has pretty good exploitation (as Joel Eddy who while seems to not like this game as much anymore put it, it's like they took all the combos of a normal deckbuilder and laid them out on the board), varying amounts of expansion and extermination depending on how you want to play, and pretty weak exploration (everyone only needs to move two spaces or less to reveal the entire board). The 4x aspect also causes some interesting decisions about your bag building since you can only exploit the resources on the board every time you reset your bag. Leaving unfinished technology rows to diminish the size of your bag, could potentially help you get an early jump start EDIT: apparently the designer did not intend for you to be able to abuse this). 

Compared to other hybrid games with a map, I think I like it more than Cyclades and Kemet, and Evo is kind of too different to compare directly (you're not really area controlling per se in Evo but have much more evolution during the course of the game and it's a much lighter game). The problem with Cyclades is it's an auction game with a map combat element, where I want it to be a map combat game driven by an auction. Kemet is a map combat game driven by Euro mechanisms, but the teleporting off the map afterwards really weakens the feel of area control. Hyperborea it feels like you can play either with focus either on the map or the cube building, and so trumps Cyclades because you can have the greater focus on the map that I want, whereas compared to Kemet there is more area control and trying to hold down tiles rather than guerilla warfare.

Compared to Trains, I think the board is more important than the original Trains but roughly similar to Rising Sun. The bonuses on the city resources on the board is substantial, there is obviously the direct combat, the center tile seems to be generally quite powerful, and even some of the parasitic nature of Trains is retained, as there are some techs that benefit adjacent neighbors. Even if you just go for a straight VP engine ideally you want to expand as far as you can without giving your opponents easy VPs by kiling off your units. This is in contrast with Trains where if your starting location ends up being too far from others to be parasitic, you have little reason to build more than a small cluster. I also really like that your rainbow color of cubes in the beginning incentivize you to do a little of everything which also helps in that regard, but doesn't try to force it on you as say something like Agricola does. As in Trains I fear if VP engine building is actually stronger than spatial play, but I think this game has much less likelihood of this being true, especially with the large amount of bonus points for area majority at game end. I'm hoping though that the different tiles significantly alter the game enough that each map feels fresh, which based on the racial different starting pieces seems pretty promising.

You get a lot of components in the box but most of the stuff, for example the minis are just ok quality. I would have been disappointed if I had bought it when the MSRP was $100, but think you get much more stuff than similar priced games now that it has been marked down.

Should you get this over Orleans? Well I haven't played Orleans yet but if your interests align with the general populace of BGG probably not. Regardless of what type of gamer you are, the risk involved means this definitely should be a try before you buy. If you are a Euro-hybrid gamer similar to me who really likes games that pushes the envelope of what you've seen before though, this might be for you.

RATING: 4
The bag-building element and taking actions with the cubes was interesting. The map part wasn't, and it felt quite disconnected. Only drawing 3 cubes per turn led to many slow turns and lots of downtime. Also, trying to keep cubes in multiples of 3 to avoid drawing fewer cubes in a turn wasn't particularly interesting (but had to be done).
I'd take Orleans over this, which seems to focus on the interesting aspects, allows for some real building up (automation, knights), and avoid the map part.

This is an interesting blend of mechanics and theme.  The cubes-in-a-bag or bag building aspect is puzzling to me.  I'm not sure if the luck of the draw makes that much difference.  The game seems like mainly an exercise in ignoring what doesn't matter and focusing on resetting as often as possible and allocating your cubes so you can use all of them no matter the order in which they come out.  This ends up being a memory exercise, as you can't look in the bag to see what cubes you have put in there or are left (IIRC).

Limitations include down-time which is too much for me if you play with new players, AP-prone players or more than three.  It also has a steep learning curve.  So, it will get played much less often than otherwise it might.

RATING: 8
Heavy game with lots of nice components.
Gameplay wise, the surprise is less than anticipated as it's just changed from cards to cubes. Another downside is downtime between players.
Solid 7 but unlikely much higher even with repeated plays and better understanding of the game. The question is, whether you should invest this sum (which can almost bring you 2 games) into a single game?
Edited on 18/1/2015:
Played 2 more games on 17/1/2015, rating up to 8 (from 7).
I think the initial rating is partly due to the unfamiliarity of the rules, and partly due to my expectations were not met. After first reading the rules, together with such nice components, I expect this game to be one with 1) strong theme and 2) high 4x component. What I get is actually an EURO ABSTRACT GAME with a rather paste on theme.
The individual starting powers are nice but not very thematic, and was not enough the create the individual differences between factions esp after each player has got 1 or 2 advance technologies. The combat is very euro, as 1) no dice rolling/ luck component involved; 2) stacking doesn't give you advantage in attack/ defense; and 3) the winning reward is quite small most of the time.
All being said, this game is still a very enjoyable ABSTRACT game, and the interaction between players is much more than another highly appreciated abstract published in 2013, Terra Mystica. The cube building is also very enjoyable once the combo is set. Thus rating up to 8.
p.s. The rule book is badly written, someone please rewrite it :)

Hyperborea may look like an American card drafting game when looking at the box cover, however it couldn't be anything but. It's an area control, dice builder game with technology development. If you try it after playing Scythe it'll jump in your face how much it feels like its older brother. I don't know if this was the template that was borrowed/copied for Scythe but it feels like it was, evidently with some new mechanics. On the plus side, it has good production and a decent theme with clean mechanics. On the negative side, your turn can be "ruined" by a bad draw of cubes. I'd play this over Scythe any day, but I'd rather play other games.

RATING: 6
It's fun, but I feel like the game needed additional play testing.  It can get really depressing later in the game when you have many more cubes than you have legal placement spots. This can result in multiple consecutive turns where you have nothing to do and are biding your time until you empty your bag and can reset.  

Also, I feel the player powers were unbalanced.  The yellow player power where you can spend victory point gems for additional actions seemed extremely overpowered.

There are six player races, but only one has a female avatar. :-P

No player aids or icon reference cards, but the game desperately needs them.

Also, note that the game is unplayable if you're colorblind. 

On the plus side, you can find this game very cheap.  I think we got ours for $25, and you get a decent game with beautiful components and miniatures for the price.

There is too much new stuff in here to properly judge Hyperborea after a single play, but I can definitely state that I liked it enough to look forward to further exploration. Although all of us struggled a bit with the various possibilities initially, this was overcome after one or two turns, and the game had a nice flow afterwards. Proper evaluation of the various sources of victory points will take a while longer and is probably the steepest part of the learning curve.

The only complaint I have for now is that some of the colours came out a bit too dark and muddy on both cubes and cards. Distinguishing red/brown and blue/green can be a challenge without very bright light.

-Something feels 'off' with how shields work.  They only stick around for a turn and you need specific colors to trigger them (at least with your basic abilities).  You can foresee an attack coming, but if you still need a certain color to trigger your shield - oh, well.  Makes shields feel very situational so why waste cubes on that action?  Doesn't allow for any defensive play.

Played twice, 4-pl. There are a couple of possible issues with the game. Our second game felt more multi-solitairish than the first, and this is accentuated by the pacing of the game. You will have turns where you know that all you will do is reset, and you wait for the other players to take their elaborate turns.

Also, there will probably be some discussion about balance, what with all the special abilities, the random map and so forth.

I rate the game an 8 for now and will be happy to play again.

This game has all of the elements that I love in a game.  Variable player powers.  Tech trees.  Variable setup.  The problem is that the game doesn't feel very compelling.  You spend 3 - 4 turns teching up the blue track, only to get... a single blue cube for your bag.  This is a game of small, subtle maneuvers, resulting in a very slow feeling game.  I find myself craving more escalation.

I'd rather play Blood Rage, Scythe, or Cry Havoc.

The creators of this game thoughtfully put the letters B, O, R and E in the title--in the right order even!--in what I like to think was a personal invitation for me to make the obvious joke. For you Eurogamers who have no sense of humor (but I repeat myself!), the game is a bore. Possibly it is a hyper bore. Okay, that's too much of a groaner even for me. But it's true. Seriously.

In what kind of game other than a Euro could exploring, fighting and killing ghosts have all of the fun sucked out? Place your cubes, move your dudes, collect your cubes, die a little inside. And so on.

I'm enjoying the bag-building fad, but this one did not work for me. The whole dudes on a map component is not up my alley, but the real frustration came from the cubes themselves. The restrictions about drawing and placing are so binding I just felt I couldn't do anything without ruining future turns. It sucked all the potential fun out. I much prefer the openness of Orleans, for example, in which a mistake will cost you time but you can always change direction.

Very very cool interesting game... the bag building mechanic is great and the way to activate things with the cubes from the bag, the cities on the board and the different faction powers (and with 2 to choose from) makes this one very very cool...

The techs that can be bought and used during the game are pretty interesting and the combos you can build with them are impressive!

Also, the amount of tiles to form the map is enormous... the replay-ability of this game is off the charts!

I played Hyperborea with two. It worked okay, but looks to be better with more. I rather liked the 'bag seeding' and cube placement for actions which was fun. Should also say the components were very nice and the possibility of the different races having some form of unique ability also seems promising. I'd definitely play this one again.

Pros:

Great mix of cube building, exploration, area control and worker placement.

Cons:

Theme feels weak, early decisions you make regarding which cubes to purchase are very important and have a big effect on whether you'll win or not. Even though there are multiple paths to victory, it seems like combat is the most important and most effective.

This game is totally under the radar. The bag-building euro element combined with the area control reminds me a lot of Mage Knight which I love, but much more streamlined gameplay and easier ruleset. Every decision on when and where to place the cube is a brain crunching exercise, knowing that a "reset" would force you to take back all the cubes even when the action is not yet completed. The management of cubes to try to have always 3 cubes for efficiency is another great brain exercise, and how to work with the bad grey cubes makes it all even harder. A bit of take that in the technologies and the bonus markers, makes this for me a and the misses a great game!

Good game, but nothing I feel the need to own.  Felt the same way about Lords of Xidit.  Here you are controlling actions by cube building and pulling cubes out of a bag.  In Lords of Xidit you are programming actions.  Both are fun and good, but I have enough dudes on the map trying to control territory games.

Excellent game that feels like a combination of a 4x game, a Euro, and a deck-builder...though in this case it is a bag builder. The game is very straight forward and easy, but there is a lot of room for depth. I love moving around, uncovering different areas on the board, and growing your tableau of available actions. The only area where this game really stumbles is with its balance. I feel like the yellow faction is way stronger than the rest, while the orange one always seems to struggle in games I've played. Otherwise this is just a fantastic game, and the only bag-builder to date that I've enjoyed.

Just watched some decent coverage on this game by the guys of Boardgame Corner and I am ecstatic to learn that this game is not as combative as I feared. Yes, there is some attacking and knocking opponents out of cities/ruins but it is handled very quickly and without a lot of messy combat mechanics. Other than that the production is drop-dead gorgeous and the bag-building mechanism is just so unique and cool.

A purebreed Euro cube-fest gunning for the trasher market by including dozens of miniatures, chits and claiming to incorporate civilization building and conquest themes.

The reality is that its your average Euro based around the idea of a pool of colored cubes that control your actions per turn as you try to chain the actions to harvest VPs in different ways.

The Theme is non-existant save for having an excuse to include some nice minis, and the game is devoid of any of the agency, confrontations and excitement that is advertized in its "civilization/conquest" gameplay pitch.

Make no mistake, this belongs only on the shelf of the diehard Euro fan.

Also: beware the downtime of doom.

Don't let the artwork confuse you, this game doesn't have any connection with the fantasy theme shown on its components. It's just another one-trick-pony of an optimisation game, the trick being here is "bag-building" which is quite a novel mechanism but doesn't save the game as a whole after hours of just going through the motions of earning cubes, putting them in the bag and drawing them. Even the short version of the game feels far too long for that.

Hyperborea actually reminded me of a complicated version of Tikal, where instead of receiving a set number of action points at the beginning of your turn, your AP's first have to be earned via a "bag-building" mechanism.

The theme is a complete lie, it's an abstract game that combines several mechanisms (deck building, set collection, area control) to create a point salad medium to heavy euro game. A 4x game? Seriously? Come on! :shake:

The box art by Miguel Coimbra is wondrous, the best I've seen lately, and the art of the technolgy cards is also very good. The minis and the rest of the art is equally good. A 10 out of 10 in this department. The bad news is that its price is consequently high, you pay for what you get.

The rules are not easy, there are many possible secenarios. I understand there have been some confusions that have been clarified via FAQ, and even some important rules change after being published. But the game is very open, there are many things to do, many paths to victory (point salad game!) to the point of being analysis paralysis prone. Still, players can start planning their next turn as soon as they finish their current one; not a lot of things will change.

The technologies seem quite unbalanced. There are some ones that are not useless, but they are way too expensive, while there are others that are great (very cheap and/or very useful and/or allow to use the grey cubes). The race powers also seem somewhat unbalanced.

Replayability should not be an issue: the terrain tiles and the available tech cards will change, and most of the race powers are not powerful enough to force you into a preset path.

Overall, it's a nice point salad game with some balance issues that can be exploited. I think it could have benefitted from some additional design work and polishing before being published. The visual aspect though couldn't be better.

[b]Hyperborea[/b] was sold via auction 8/8/15.

[i]This game held a lot of promise, mostly because I love the idea of deck building but hate shuffling cards continuously so the idea of substituting cubes for cards sounded awesome. Unfortunately the game failed to deliver for both my kids and I. 

First turns in this game can be quite slow and prone to AP as you try and plan ahead future turns to make sure you maximize your possible actions without having to reset before getting to pull off the move you want to make. This leads to my next problem, the turns that move quickly for you are usually quite anti-climactic since you didn't get the cards you needed. 

I also found the overall aesthetics of the game to be all over the place, the minis were okay, I really liked the card art, but the tiles were ugly and the graphic design was terrible the symbols they use are counter intuitive. 

I still think the bag building concept is pretty cool, but unfortunately Hyperborea doesn't deliver. In the end the theme is wasted and the game ends up being disjointed collection of mechanisms and concepts that don't gel together to offer a smooth game play experience.[/i]

Interesting. Felt a little solitary and unbalanced, but could have been bad luck with the setup of the tiles. The complexity and option you have with the race, cards and combination/order of actions makes it very difficult to anticipate what is coming, which makes proper planning even more difficult. Wait factor is high too sometimes. But a great game that needs to be played more!

I got this for Paulo because he loves "tech trees" and medieval/questing themes. Hyperborea is your prototypical 4X civilization game with hexes, units, and resources with a Euro mechanic at the center, managing turns and game play. I'm generally not a fan of these games because turns can be so tedious and can draw the game out longer than it needs to be. However, Hypberborea's bag mechanic cuts all of the AP out by focusing on "points": movement, attack, drawing more cubes, etc. It's a game of area control and resource management, with a little bit of card drafting and deck-building as well. I was especially happy to find out there are multiple strategies to the end-game. Yes, you can get points by destroying your friend's armies but you can also win by cultivating your own civilization and "deck." Hyperborea is fun, although it's more of a Euro than a 4X game. That's good news for people like me who love Euros; bad news for people who love Chaos in the Old World and StarCraft.

RATING: 9
Great game.  You have to balance different types of "power" and stick to a strategy to be successful, and there are enough rules that it's not lightweight and something that you're not going to appreciate fully in the first game.  But once we got into it this is one my favorite games.

The game isn't really difficult to pick up - place tiles down in different combinations to get benefits - move, attack, get a new warrior, etc.  Capture cities and ruins to get some additional benefits.  "Fund" research to gain more cubes.

There's enough randomness that your best laid plans can fail (you pick up to three cubes at random at the end of your turn), but you can play things right to manage that at least a little.  My 11 year-old picked it up after a single game and handles the explanations for new players when they join us.

Highly recommended on all counts.  Just beware it's not a short game - 90 minutes is probably about right for an experienced set of players playing.

Played a few times, never with characters. This is a game that suits me, it's more about the first 3 X:es than fighting. And fighting in it's simplicity is excellent. First time I tried this game the guy who explained it said the characters were too unbalanced so we skipped those. I haven't tried with characters yet, but since there are great unbalance between the cards too why take the characters away? 

We invented a house rule for the first play that we have stuck to since, and it works well: As there are only two objective tiles for each objective only the first two to fulfill the objectives gets a tile and thus the two points at the end of the game. Everyone else can still count fulfilling the objectives towards end game condition, but without getting the two points. This creates need for strategic choices to fulfill the objectives in the best order. 

Both mechanics and components are of great quality, but the color choices are poor. It's very hard to distinguish between the very dark red and reddish purple, both with the cubes and on the player boards/cards. I am going to use pink cubes instead of the purple and do something I rarely do (because that ruins the original mint condition of the game): make custom pink stickers to put on cards, tokens and boards to match the cubes.

Based on one play: A nice mix of a Euro and Ameritrash. You battle on a small board while getting runes and fighting for control of spaces, however that is only half the game. You also collect cubes which let you perform actions and buy other actions. You draw 3 cubes each turn (you can buy modifiers) and have to determine how to use them to perform actions. Very nice mechanic and plays very smoothly as you draw your next cubes at the end of your turn and can think of your next turn.

RATING: 7
Hyperborea is a light “dudes-on-a-map” type game in which the actions you can take are governed by a pouch-building mechanic. Each turn, you pull three tokens from your pouch, which you can assign to various actions (two or three tokens per action), such as producing a new figure, moving a figure, attacking with a figure, advancing on tracks that will eventually add tokens to your pouch, gaining crystals (points), or acquiring special rule-breaker cards. Each player starts with a special ability that allows them to perform one of these six actions a little better. Players expand from their initial space on the board, first attacking neutral pieces guarding key spots on the board, and eventually attacking other players. These key spots include ruins, which grant a one-time use token, and cities, which can be used once per round for a minor benefit. At the end of the game, points are earned according to number of figures defeated (neutrals are worth more than opponent’s pieces), number of game board tiles controlled, number of tokens in your pouch, crystals, and point values printed on rule-breaker cards. While this is a multi-player combat game, combat is very streamlined (you attack, you win) and it’s not worth it to go after opponents until there are no neutral targets. Games based on producing and moving guys around a map attacking each other isn’t really my style, but this one was okay.

This is only the rating after 1 play of a short game with 2 players. Obviously probably not ideal playing conditions, but it was still enjoyable. I feel a lot of similarities to Orleans and the actions are set up similarly as well. I do find that 6 colors might be a bit much to keep track of and you literally can't do anything until it's your turn.

I worry about downtime with more than 3 players. Even 4 might be the upper threshold with this unless you're goofing around when it's not your turn.

The rulebook was just okay and I had a hard time figuring out exactly what it meant in spots. Namely actually removing cubes after an action is resolved (you don't until reset). AND THE RED AND PURPLE LOOK VERY SIMILAR until you put them side by side. A few times I thought I had drawn a purple, taken my turn only to realize it was actually red. I really think they should have made that color bright red instead of a weird purply/red color.

This is an interesting bag building game where you are trying to balance action cube acquisition with getting enough new action spaces to use those cubes. The board consists of hexes with special abilities on them, which you are fighting other players for control over. This game straddles the line between euro and ameritrash and does so quite elegantly. The game attempts to minimize downtime by having you draw cubes for your following turn at the end of your current turn, which helps but doesn't eliminate some of the AP that can happen when someone's lined up a series of big moves. The game ends when a certain number of objectives are completed.

Although the printed player count is 2-6, this game really only works well with 3 or 4 players. With 2 it's too much direct conflict, and with 5 or 6 the downtime between turns is unmanageable.

Sept 2017: Dropped from 5 to 4. We played at 6 (I'm assuming with an expansion). Way too much downtime. And way too Euro; the cube-drawing mechanic distracts from the game.

Sep 2014: I'm not a fan of civ games, nor am I a fan of deckbuilding games. This game made me realize why -- most civ games, like many Euro games, are a mix of mechanics. In civ games, it's the 4X model. I just find that in most civ games, the implementation of each 'X' isn't that compelling.

For a civ game, though, it's very, very streamlined.

Played six times in the fortnight since Essen!  Easy to achieve with a short, light game but a real accolade for a 90+ minute game.

Clearly a 4X game that rewards good resource management (the cubes in the bag), with a pretty low luck factor and simple rules.

Only two negatives so far - some cube colours are hard to tell apart in poor light (especially red & purple), and an experienced player can crush new players quite easily.  Other than that, fantastic.

With 4 or 5 games of Hyperborea under my belt now, I'm enjoying the game but with a few concerns. Firstly, although the box says it goes to 6 players I think the downtime would be crippling at that number. It's bad enough with 5. Secondly I'm not 100% convinced that the game is balanced, both on the variable power levels of the techs and principally on the racial advantages.

Feels like with another few months of polishing in playtesting this could have been AAA.

RATING: 5
While the elementary mechanisms are quite different, Hyperborea feels a lot like Eclipse in a Fantasy Setting. You have the exploration, conquering of tiles which are occupied by "ancients", buy technology from a common supply to individualize your faction, and eventually attack other players.

The cube mechanism for the action selection is to my knowledge unique and poses nice puzzles to the players. As in Eclipse there is some luck in which tiles you discover. The combat is very streamlined, tactical and rather on a skirmish level. I prefer this over Eclipse's approach.

The rulebook has some unclear rules, so you have to check the official FAQ (which are not extensive). However, there is also a rules erratum about putting back your cubes at reset. The rules as written allow for broken strategies (especially the yellow player can become nearly unstoppable). I do not know how such things slipped playtesting. As in Lewis&Clark (see discussion about hanging back strategies) a rule that was meant to protect inexperienced players from severe punishing gives experienced players the possibility to brake the game. My rating for the game is with playing with the corrected rules (otherwise it would be broken).

I am not a big fan of those "civilization with dudes on a map" or 4X games, so I am only luke warm on Hyperborea.

A clever game that is fairly clean, not too long, with what appears to be a good level of direct interaction between players.

My only complaint is that the cubes left in your own bag should be visible whenever you are not actively drawing from the bag -- it's easy but annoying to track, and critical to do so.  But that's easily house ruled!

26-01-2015. Rated after 1 play. Very confusing game to me. It's kind of like an area control game with combo/engine building element in the form of a bag with different colored cubes. You're buying cards that give you additional abilities to use the cubes for. You get points for many things, like buying cubes, controlling areas..

It's interesting, but I totally didn't understand it.

RATING: 7
Interesting cube-bag building game.  Downtime seemed a big problem - even though players draw 3 cubes at the end of their turn and can plan their next turn, because there are so many ways to draw more cubes during your turn and because as the number of cubes decreases in your bag you can try to plan out what colors you will draw next turn (or if you should use tech to add more cubes to your bag), AP was an issue for us, especially me. I really don't like the aspect that you can have a wasted turn when you only draw 1 last cube from your bag - it meant I spent an excessive amount of time counting and planning out 2-3 turns in advance to avoid this potential but this aspect didn't feel fun, just work.  The actual gameplay on the board - moving figures on hexes, occupying cities/ruins for extra actions, extremely simple battles - felt very uninspired and cookie-cutter.  Although quite different, the game reminded me a bit of Macao, where you're deciding what color cubes to collect and planning for the future.  So all in all, I'd be happy to play this one again, but I'm not going to seek it out and would much prefer Macao.  

Also, good lighting is a must. I'm not color-blind at all, but for me, the red and purple cubes and their spots on cards were sometimes near-impossible for me to tell apart and I needed other players to tell me the color.  Really bad design choice there.

A little rough around the edges, but nevertheless a great game.

I bought this when I heard of the bag building mechanic, which sounded interesting to me. The game did not disappoint and I can see it hitting the table often.  

As others point out, there seems to a few nit-picky balance issues with some race abilities and card effects, but nothing that breaks the game or cannot be fixed with a few house rules.

The theme, map, and miniatures might suggest otherwise, but this is pretty much a pure euro.

Only played the introductory game a couple of times so this mark could change. It's pretty fast-moving once you get up to speed and the 'bag-building' mechanic appeals. Plastic fantasy guys less so. It does feel like a collection of mechanics rather than a coherent theme to me, but it's fun all the same. **** EDIT more games were fun but in part due to it's size, set-up and take-down, it didn't end up a keeper.

Fantasy civ-lite, best with 3-4 players, 90 minutes.

Update: played this at BGGcon 2015. Okay, there is some good stuff here but I have to complain about the color of the components. I'm the only nominal colorblind in our group, but I suspect my dad has some (blue/purple) colorblindness. Anyway, even the "normal" guys were having some issues with the colors of the cubes, and even where the cube colors didn't match the colors printed on the cards very well.

All that aside, I think the game plays pretty well, and I'd even like to try it again, but it felt overly long. I think we were closer to 2.5 hours in duration, and that included trying to force the end sooner just so we could finish. I guess that makes it sound bad, heh. Anyway, I'm giving it a 7 for now and would like to revisit it, but at this point don't need to own it.

Gift from my Secret Santa 2014! Two games in and I really like it. First game was with 6, which I think is a bit too many for this interesting mesh of bag building and area control. Second game, with 3, felt like the sweet spot, but we'll see with repeated plays. 

Sidenote: the factions may or may not be balanced. I love the green, red, and purple factions; but the orange left me cold. A friend played yellow quite well, and red looks decent enough. Maybe I just don't get how to play orange.

Another great game of 2014. This reminds me a bit of Nexus Ops, with building armies to conquer a relatively small hexagonal grid.

RATING: 6.5
1 play, 6er

An interesting pouch-building game, like Orleans, but somewhat inferior for several reasons -- mechanisms that serve only to slow the game down by making player turns take longer:
- supports up to 6, which is very VERY slow!
- cubes are not allocated until your turn = slow
- you can draw additional cubes on your turn = slow
- the artifact display can change from turn to turn = slow
- the board can change, with new terrain being revealed and units moving around = slow

Still, I think this would be a fun game with 4. 

Rating: 7.5

--------
2nd play, 2er

Still a pretty good game, but the way the game slows down is really pretty annoying; it makes Orleans seem just that much better!

Dropping my rating to 6.5

--------
3rd play, 3er

I'm liking this game less every time I play it! We had one newbie, but still: the wait is PAINFUL!! Cube drawing is so SO annoying. It seems as if this ought to be a fun game, but I really just want Orleans!

6/10

--------
4th play, 4er

With 2 newbies, but faster players than any others we'd played with before. The game is certainly better with faster play, but still not great. Maybe worth a +0.5, though.

6.5?

RATING: 8
Buyer beware, this game is probably a bit overproduced and overpriced for what it is.  From the description, box size, price tag, and amount of stuff in this package I really did expect a sprawling and epic game.  It is not that but it is still a really good game.

It's really hard to shoehorn this into a genre.  It is all at once a little bit action selection, area control, worker placement, and civilization game.  Let me just give a quick rundown on how it is played.  Each player has a board with several actions on it, you can also gain "advanced technologies" with additional actions on them as well.  Each action requires 2-3 cubes of different colors to activate.  Each turn each player draws 3 cubes at random from a bag.  These are assigned to these actions to activate them.  They do a variety of different things including moving, attacking, gaining new units, gaining victory points, and gaining more of the aforementioned advanced technologies.

Most of those actions are carried out on a board made up of tiles where you can explore new spaces, enter cities or ruins for bonus actions, and kill ghosts or the other players to vie for control of valuable tiles.

Like I said, not the sprawling game I was expecting.  The iconography in the game is pretty self explanatory and all the actions are boiled down to their simplest function.  Battles, for example, are simply if you earn an attack point and are on the same tile as an opponent, they die.  If they have a fortification token, you need 2 attack points.  The end.  The game does also have some nice and subtle rules.  The one I really like is that you don't get points for killing opponents' units unless you have already killed a full set of each of your opponents' units.  This is a nice, unobtrusive way to discourage ganging up on a single player.

Despite this game's misleading form-factor I actually really enjoyed it.  The mechanics of pulling cubes out of a bag and assigning them to technologies are a little abstracted but what the glint and gloss of the game does achieve is coating those mechanics with enough theme that it feels like so much more.  There are a lot of options and a lot of thinkiness and you can still find yourself immersed in it.

Having played it now with a 3 and a 5 player count there can tend to be a down time problem.  A player takes all the actions they can/want to before passing the turn so with more players you are waiting a lot longer between your turns and doing nothing.  With 3 I didn't notice this issue at all.  I would guess 4 would be the max that I would play this game with and even that would have some rounds dragging a bit.

Imperfect, but I enjoy it, and it's one of the few 6 player games in my collection. I won't say it's best with 6, but it's good to have options.

This was one of the first bag builders, and I think it does a good job of giving you enough control over your strategy by allowing you to control what goes into your bag and when. If you put a bunch of blue and orange cubes in your bag, you're not going to do much moving and killing.

The rule-book leaves open questions it shouldn't, and the optional asymmetrical powers don't really add much good to game. They can be a fine way to mix things up, but they don't seem particularly balanced. I've used them a few times now and never felt like I enjoyed the game more than just playing vanilla.

Do not buy this if you're looking for a war game or lots of combat. This is definite euro through and through.

Having played 6 or 7 times in two weeks, I can tell from my and my friends' reactions that this one will hit the table frequently in the years to come. Mechanics are simple but engaging, with many levels of solid strategy. Easy to teach and learn. Components are simply beautiful, with excellent quality throughout. Plays well with 2, played up to 5 and scales well. One of the few games I've ever played that actually took about as long as the box said it would (25 minutes per player). Simply wonderful.

There is a lot of game in this box: different modes, different lengths, different setups. I only played short invasion (3- and 4-player) so it's hard to make a complete comment about this game. It's one of those games that you can call hybrid: they look like they are about fighting and exploring and they mostly are about balancing blocks and cards. I had fun playing, the design offers nice mechanics, but for me gaming magic does not really happen. The fact that you can have a turn in which you can do nothing hurts the fun for me. I also would not try playing 6-player, downtime would be too much.

The game has some interesting elements .... I looks like an Ameritrash game but in reality it is a resource alloction game.  You use resources pulled from your bag.  Only problem that I see is that the individual powers of the races seem to be way out of sync with other elements.  I played the blue and concentrated on getting techs and moving down the track to get more cubes and won the game in 4 bag resets.  By using my power I was getting twice the number of cubes on the board as my opponenets almost right after the first reset.  A useful tech that came out early allowed me to buy cheaply two techs per turn which ended the game pretty fast

tl;dr: good, but how good?

Bag building was one of the hot mechanisms at Essen last year. This is one of the games that have it. It's like deckbuilding: it's a mechanic that can be very effective and enjoyable if used well. Judging from this first play this game does a pretty good job at using this mechanism.
You draw cubes to perform actions. Some actions give you more cubes, others let you get cards to help you be more effective or they let you do stuff on the board. What did surprise me a bit was that you can completely ignore the board if you like. And the while other players did use the board, it still felt a bit underdeveloped. But that might be just a wrong impression from the first play.
All in all I must say that I quite enjoyed this game, but I'm not quite sure how good it actually is. It's not bad, that's for certain.

I'm entirely unconvinced by the balancing of the special powers and oddly this seemed to end just as the engine building was getting going - and this was playing the medium length game too.

None of those are my biggest concerns though. The game is so overwhelmingly heads-down solitaire maximising of actions that adding other players just adds to the downtime not the interaction.

My rating counts for a short faction wars game and might go up, but more likely it's bound to go down to a 3 with further plays. 

For the good of the game, the game features a very nice idea. The action selection/deck building-mechanism is novel and very clever. Unfortunately, it also favors luck of the draw, which in this case has a much higher impact than other deckbuilders, where one suboptimal draw can be compensated whereas here it means that quite likely also your next draw sucks.

The rulebook is one of the worst I've endured in years. When explaining the game please start with the core and make your way from there to the outer rim. Don't - by any means - start at the outer rim, go to the game's core (briefly) only to jump back to the outer rim and so forth.  

Next major flaw are the faction powers. Without judging yellow and purple powers, Blue totally breaks the game. Drawing additional cubes means more actions meaning earlier resets meaning more options in regards to the actions. A vicious circle or - as for the blue player - a heavenly circle. Made worse if it's the blue player who gets to obtain the advanced technologies for additional draws. Unbalanced meets runaway leader problem, what a couple.A short game further enhances this effect, but I doubt it would be getting much better in a normal game. (Blue wasn't that far off from having 12 victory points) Perhaps the long game would make a difference.

As much as I like the design, the idea and the merger of Euro and Ameritrash, I just don't like this game.

Not a fan. I felt duped; that awesome cover artwork is a total deception. This is another dry cube pusher (the difference being that you pull them out of a bag first, in the lamest bit of "deck-building" I've ever seen).

Someone in our game compared it to Eclipse, which I think is correct. Both games lure you in with the promise of a thematic, exciting experience, when the reality is anything but that.

I will give it points for artwork and component quality, and it plays quickly.

I actually thoroughly enjoyed my plays of this, and would gladly play it.

Does the bag building really well, and is always different and interesting.

I do feel that the tokens you get from ruins are unbalanced and can really swing a game sometimes, but c'est la vie.

First Impression:

An area control light civ game, with an innovative pool building mechanism.

I loved the theme of the game, and the components are of great quality. The factions are also very diverse and interesting, and when combined with the modular map the result is great replayability. The tiles are very well designed and balanced, and the arrangement is very important for gameplay reasons. I liked the action restriction part of the main mechanic, as it forces players to specialise through time and research (or pool management), creating a great sense of accomplishment while at the same time preventing the overuse of certain actions. The battles are also simple yet very effective, and the need to kill all enemies evenly as well as the neutral ghosts combined with the action restriction practically eliminates king making -  a great accomplishment for an area control game.

The low points. I liked the idea of technologies, but found them widely unbalanced. The permanent effect technologies seem to me way more powerfull than standard ones. Maybe specialisation or the long game will have an effect but otherwise some are quite powerless. I also felt like moving very slowly in my turn, as 3 cubes are quite a few and without the civ and exploration bonuses the progress is quite slow. I also didn't like the memory aspect of the pool building as it becomes needlesly difficult as time goes by. I'd love the same system with all cubes available from turn one and the bag eliminated. Some action sets also felt quite gamey and I didn't really see the thematic need for them.

Overall hyperborea is a game that does a lot of things great, and some things OK. I usually don't like civ games with an area control aspect, but this one worked like a charm. I found myself thinking about the system and possible strategies after the session, which is a very good sign. The rating might go widely up or down, depending on whether or not the main mechanism will tire me, or reveal its brilliance to me, after repeated plays.

I didn't really know that much about this game, other than it was a "bag-builder" game and that someone had called it a civ-lite game. But that had been enough to grab my interest and I've been wanting to try it.

The game revolves around cubes that you randomly draw out of your bag, three per turn. You have a player board with six different areas that you can play to. Each area is keyed to a particular action type and requires a particular color cube (and possibly others). There are two actions possible in each area, one is more flexible about which colors are required to trigger it, while the other is a better version of that action but requires more specific colors. You can only perform one or the other for this "reset". When you fill all the colored spaces in an area you get to take the actions associated with that space. You keep taking turns drawing cubes from the bag until it's empty, at which point you put all your cubes back into the bag and "reset" your warriors on the board.

The actions relate to getting warriors, moving them about the board, attacking other things, getting victory points, getting advances in color techs (which eventually get you more cubes) getting tech buildings (which require cubes but provide special abilities). Getting tech buildings also gives you a gray "trash" cube which generally can't be used to do anything (except when it can).

The warriors can be used to gather bonus tokens from the ruins on the board, trigger cities which do cool abilities, attack the ghosts that guard ruins and cities, attack other players, and take control of tiles (by building a majority on the tile). The majorities are scored at game end (1 for starting tiles of your civilization, 2 for other tiles and 4 for the centermost tile). After a warrior activates a city or ruin, they can't do anything else until you trigger a reset.

At game end you get points for controlled tiles, enemy warriors you've killed (although there's a mechanism that prevents you from beating up on one player too much) ghosts you've killed (which oddly rewards you for killing exactly three ghosts best, more or less isn't as efficient), cubes you've gathered during the game (except trash cubes), tech buildings (either zero, one or two points depending on the type) and of course any VP's you got along the way. There's also bonuses if you trigger any of the end of game conditions (getting 12 VP's, deploying all your warriors, building 5 tech buildings). If two of those three conditions are met, the game will end, and every other player gets another turn.

I had a lot of fun with the game. There's a lot to think about, and it can be puzzly at times. Often you're forced to compromise based on what cubes you've pulled out of your bag. Making do the best you can with what you get is a mechanism I usually enjoy.

There's a bit of randomness in the game in a few different ways. Like the random distribution of terrain tiles, some of which have movement cost penalties (although the more challenging tiles usually give better rewards). And the layout of buildings in the tech area (although you can flush a category before buying which offsets this). Each player color has a special power and I'm not sure that they're all equally valuable. Taking the Green player color and getting a movement bonus power wasn't nearly as cool when it was revealed that the majority of terrain tiles didn't have a movement penalty. The one bit of randomness that was most annoying to me was the random distribution of the tokens you draw.

At one point I was forced to discard a bonus token for no reward as I had two in hand both of which let me draw cubes from my bag, which was empty at the time. You can only keep one token at a time, so I had to spend the other for nothing. That was a particularly bitter pill to swallow when I watched other players draw tokens that just flat out gave them points.

But as annoying as random luck can be, I think it's a minor complaint about the game. Overall the game was a lot of fun and was an enjoyable challenge. After the game, I was already looking forward to playing again.

Mecánica deckbuilding pero con cubitos. Un euro disimulado con figuritas. Tablero de losetas hexagonales con un set up que recuerda al Runewars. Sacas 3 cubitos de la bolsa que te dan distintivas acciones. Bastante dinámico y duración controlada. Lo mejor que tiene es que cuando terminas turno sacas los 3 cubitos de la siguiente ronda y ya piensas tu futuro turno lo que disminuye el downtime y el AP.

I get why people are so divided about this game.

It's no adventure or battle game, but it takes civilization building and puts it on a board.

I love that.

I like the bag-building and the special abilities.

For all of the talk about the balance of the game, it's easy enough to play with the characters you want, or you can let new players play with characters that are easier.

This game is among my favorites, but I love Euros. So be warned.

Full disclosure: I received a review copy of this game from the company.

Really enjoy the uniqueness of it.  A hand management game without a hand of cards.  Very pretty, over the top production, fun engine building and some direct competition.  Love that it still has some vague Amerithrash vibes to it through it's look and area control aspects.

For me this has the combo-generation and efficiency engine that a deck-builder, without all the inane card shuffling and solitaire feel.

Okay game, enjoyable most of the time and the new concept of cubebag-building feels fresh and functional. With 6 players the downtime grows way too much even with very non-AP players. The rules were also very weak out of the box and some basic, important rules were only to be found in the FAQ.
The game falls into the category that even if it's good, it's too late to the party. Nowadays I have too many games in the same weight/duration class that I enjoy more, thus this game stands little chance of receiving more plays despite the novelty of cubebag-building.

Good civ game, shorter than most, and different enough to be worth a look in a genre that is beginning to get very, very crowded.  I'm not nuts about the generic fantasy universe, but the techs, variable factions, and interesting cube system all meld together into a very interesting whole.  Having a satisfying tech system in a game this quick is very unique.

The predecessor to Orleans with bag building but I would say slightly more limiting and definitely more thematic. Here you kill opponent pieces for points and there is an element of area control--in Orleans you're just doing stuff for VPs mostly. The one thing that was less fun was the three cube draw-up limit, which can be mitigated in Orleans and makes the game more fun. It also makes Hyperborea more of a challenge, so it's a trade off. Overall, two very different games and I like both.

RATING: 4
A deck builder where instead of cards you have colored cubes, which are used in different combinations to perform actions. Thus if you want to pursue a particular strategy, you buy the appropriate color cubes to add to the bag that you're drawing from each turn, e.g. combat actions tend to require red cubes. Beyond that there's a modular hex board that players explore and fight each other on. Other than the cube bag for determining your actions it's pretty run-of-the-mill, and I suspect that despite the theme and plastic figures, Ameritrashers will find this too soulless and lacking in chrome; yet for a Euro/deck builder it's a bit shallow... I'd play it a few more times, but it didn't really capture my imagination.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Not what I was expecting. It's a blend of Euro and Ameritrash.......... and it works. The components and art are good. The rulebook is horrible and there are a lot of rules you will need to look up and NOT FIND in there which is frustrating. Moves along pretty fast after a couple of turns. I wouldn't play with more than 4 players as I think down time would be too long.

RATING: 9
This game was a blast!

We were surprised by the varieties of viable strategies to chose acoording to the particular setup you are playing with: if you pick many hexagons with cities and ruins, you almost play another game compared to a setup where you find you cities and maybe some mountain terrain. Same thing goes for the advances technologies: those can be combined togheter and can really change your whole approach to the match. Luck is a factor for sure, expecially with fighting and drawing gray cubes in bad moments, but a good player that manages to keep track of the cubes in his reserve can easy turn the odds in his favour. This whole mechanic of building your pool is quite entertaining, because if picking new cubes is nice because those are worth victory points, by filling your bag you screw up the chances of picking up cubes of the other colours, and you also find yourself waiting much more for resets. Its a game of strategy and balance. For sure there are MANY things to track and this can annoy the most casual gamers, but its instead really sweet for anyone who loves evolution games.

RATING: 5
- no combos
- tech cards not as fun as I wished for. Just more of the same.
- randomness of city powers
- randomness od terrains. Forests are much better defense than swamps.
- low interaction. One of the player asked: did I execute my turn right? Everyone else said: We don't know, we're not watching your moves.

The game is just a bag builder with miniatures to prevent you from running away from the table. As the adventure game it sucks - there are much better titles. As the euro-game it's bland. King's Pouch was MUCH better in that departament.

DOA (dead on arrival) game.

This is probably the second weirdest game in my collection, behind Terra Mystica. It looks like a wargame, but in reality it is more like a deck-building card game that uses little wooden cubes instead of cards. No, that doesn't make any sense...but I told you this game was crazy.

I'm not entirely convinced that the asymmetric faction powers are balanced, but otherwise the game plays like a dream. Short fast turns are the norm and end-game triggers are easy to manipulate, which makes for some difficult tactical decision making, whether you're winning or losing.

RATING: 8
This game gives a new twist to the traditional drafting mechanism. Instead of drafting cards you draft cubes and then you utilize them on an expanding set of technologies in order to execute actions. Really cool game, plays quite smoothly and requires quite a bit of thought. Due to the modular map and the technology deck there is a lot of replayability here. The English rule book could have been a bit clearer but for experienced players a couple of games should be enough to iron out any quirks. The color some cubes (primarily red and purple) can be somewhat confusing. Other than that a stellar new game! Recommended.

It could've been one of my fave game but it has a huge flaw. I don't need 3-4 hours game but this is too fast for advanced strategies. It also have 3 settings for duration but quite useless since once you get to what would end the game for mid duration, the game is already decided even for long duration. It turns a game full of nice mechanics into an introduction to 4X game....
Map its also too small since it gets revealed in a couple of turns.

Expansion doesn't solve its flaw...

If you are looking for a fast easy 4X this might be a good choice if you don t mind the lack of depth.

The bagbuilding part of this game is slow and AP-prone, and the area control part is... well area control. What really saves the game from me hating it is that one rule where you have to kill one of each of your opponents pawn before you can just kill anyone for points. But it's still just a meh game for me.

Going out on a limb with a relatively high rating, but I think it's deserved with the updated errata.  Innovative take on deck building where instead you "cube build" to plan for what you want to do.  This is primarily in the Euro category despite the capability for conflict which gives it a bit of Weuro appeal.

What I Love-
I love the big turns, multiple actions, and vast variability this game provides.... I haven't been this excited since my first plays of dominion!!!!

What I Dislike-
Unnecessary fog of War that dissipates after two turns of exploring. Big turns can mean big waits at higher game counts. I recommend 3-player or less. Beginning of game is a rush for the ruins, then becomes tug of war for area control. Fortifying is meh...

It's hard to give a rating to such a complex game after just one play. It's a tad too complicated in the rules for my tastes but after several turns it starts to flow well. I would say that 5 players is too much and i am quite sure 3 would be the best. I'd like to better explore all of the possible interactions of the many many available strategies there are.
Components are superb.
Rating is going to raise when i'll have the chance to play it again.

I'm not entirely sure what to think of Hyperborea yet. It's got a lot of great elements to it: a hexagonal tile map, dudes to put on said map, cards that give you additional abilities, asymmetric player powers, and the bag-building mechanism that feels superior to deck-building in almost every way. I enjoy the tiny bit of aggression the game has along with the general feeling of progression and the waste that comes along with it. I quite enjoy the card and player artwork, I think that was done very nicely.

However, the game feels a bit bland and the artwork on the map tiles feels muddy and plain. You can [i]occasionally[/i] have a turn where you draw cubes that don't let you do anything, but this can be mostly mitigated by making sure you have the right cubes in your bag.

Overall I'm left with the feeling that I need to play this again in order to fully flesh out my opinion on it, but I do want to play it again, so that's a start.

This game feels like a fantasy 4X deck builder with dice. Up to six mythical realms compete for gems on a modular hex terrain by blowing each other away, destroying ghosts and earning rewards from objective cards.  The meat of the game is the cube building system.  Adding specific cubes increases your odds of pulling the cubes you need to unlock specific actions. Once unlocked and expended, the cubes go back to the bag to be pulled in future rounds. Keep garbage cubes to a minimum as they are wasted pulls. Combat is a simple action with lots of indiscriminate killing of other player dudes as realms jockey for area control.

Way too much downtime during my 4P game. Some interesting stuff here (variable powers, worker cubes as the pool( and it's a game I wanted to like but too many mechanics I don't like (deckbuilding, 4x, heavy downtime during other player turns) combined for an unenjoyable game.

Another entry onto the light civilization dancefloor - now featuring a cast of thousands - but this one trips all over itself and never gets up. I'd call it hyper-boring, but that's too cheesy even for me.

This game was designed for... who, exactly? No "thematic" gamer would select this over other options, and Euro-civvers have scores of quality alternatives.

Please don't support the designers by purchasing a copy, borrowing a copy, giving them the time of day, or glancing in their general direction.  Some sins can never be forgiven.

* Theme & mechanics disconnect: Check
* Horrendous downtime : Check

I can only see this as a 2-3 player game.
With 6 players this would be torture.
First play with 5 players took over 3 hours and a half.
Of that time, I feel like I've played half and hours and waited for 3 hours. Your actions are dictated by the cubes you draw. The good thing is that you can ponder on what to do while other players are doing their thing. The engine building doesn't come through for me, the technologies are bland and I just don't see why I'd bother with this frankenstein-ish abomination.

Fantastic game, one of the best game I have played in 2014. Yes there are some balance issue and random starting tile placement, but if you are a good player, even with a disadvantage in race and/or starting tile, you will still beat less experienced player 9 out of 10 times. The race special ability is not a very big part of the game but there are more strategy in which cards you take and combo together.I think 1 good expansion that fix some balance issue can make this one of the best light strategy civilization game. Very much enjoy it!

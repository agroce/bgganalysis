Bingo Carcassonne. Pretty much what you would expect, but pretty good. Nothing to complain about.

Erinnert stark an Carcassonne, selbst die Spielfiguren sehen aus wie Carcassonne-Meeples. 
Das Legen unterscheidet sich insoweit, als die benachbarten Plättchen nicht "passen" müssen. Einsetzen und Werten der Figuren ähnelt Carcassonne sehr stark, allerdings kann man statt eine Figur einzusetzen auch eine schon im Spiel befindliche versetzen. 
Im Solospiel ergibt sich so kein wirklich großer Unterschied zu Carcassonne. 
Das Spiel zu zweit vermittelt dann aber doch ein anderes Spielgefühl. Beide Spieler haben identische Kartensätze, aber nur der Vorgabespieler mischt sein Karten und zieht sie von seinem verdeckten Stapel. Der zweite Spieler nutzt seine Karte mit der selben Nummer. Jeder Spieler hat seine eigene Auslage, die er ausbaut und wo er seine Figuren setzt. Von 24 Karten, die jeder hat, kommen 16 ins Spiel und bilden letztlich jeweils eine 4x4-Auslage. Obwohl also letztlich beide Spieler die selben 16 Karten in ihrer Auslage haben, kommt es natürlich darauf an, wie diese ausgelegt und wohin die Figuren gesetzt worden sind.

Carcassonne-ra hajaz, de jobban tetszik annál. Talán nem annyira letisztult, pl. az embermozgatás a szabályban nem teljesen világos (lehet hogy a magyar rossz csak, az eredetit nem néztem, de a magyar szöveg ellentmond a mellette lévő képnek!). Kicsit erősnek tűnik az erdő, sokkal könnyebben ad pontot, mint a többi. Szabály 2 perc alatt elmondható, 10 perc alatt lemegy egy parti.
---
Mivel úgyis pasziánsz az egész, nekem majdnem egyenértékű a szóló a kétszemélyessel. 100 perc alatt 16 szóló játék lement:)
---
Szerintem túl egyértelmű a sorrend. A víz a körülményesebb, csak kiegészítő pontokat szerezhetünk vele, és a homokkal is. Az erdővel és a kilátóval sokkal könnyebben sokkal több pont szerezhető.

2 játék - 2 játékos: Kicsit csalódás a játék, pedig jó alapokkal rendelkezik. Társasjátékkal ismerkedőknek ajánlható. Nagyon korlátozottak a lehetőségek.

Ingenious little filler which can be played 2 player or solo. Most of my plays have been solo, in which capacity it becomes a fantastically addictive puzzle to solve and beat your high score. As a 2 player game it's the very definition of multiplayer solitaire, but it's still fun to compare your finished landscapes and choices.

RATING: 4
A slightly pointless exercise. Essentially a solo game and not a particularly good one. It's mildly interesting to get to the end and see how your opponent played the same cards slightly differently, but really, it's just dull. No real game and zero interaction. Also a typically oversized box.

Update having played solo: same opinion, perhaps slightly better solo with some fun in trying to get at least 49 but once that was achieved, nothing left to play for.

Limes is based on Cities level 2, as noone played with level 3 for fear of spontaneous brain combustion. The author revamped movement (no more drawing meeples off of the map), and made every scoring method different (in Cities level 2, two methods are identical). The result is a better Cities level 2, and as such I can recommend it to whoever likes that. Unfortunately the rules of Limes cannot be backported to Cities as the tile distribution has changed, and new graphic features have been added, so if you want to play Limes you have to purchase a copy. It's not expensive, but still. (Then again, Limes can only be played with 2 unless you purchase two boxes, then you can play upto 4 like in the original.)

[b]Update[/b] Yellow farmland seems very weak. The fraction of double areas has dropped compared to Cities, thus making VPs for normal large areas less attractive. Shame, really, that these scoring methods appear not to be as balanced as could be. Degraded by 1 point.

Interesting two player puzzle game whereby you draw identical tiles to place and build your tableau. There are four terrain types upon which you can place workers and each scored differently at game end (turn 16).

Only one play so we didn't really get to interrogate the scoring mechanics very much but they seem a little unbalanced. There are far fewer points available for farmers and fisherman than there are for watchman and woodcutters.

It is more a puzzle than a game as nothing your opponent does affects your score in any way you simple tot up points at the end and see who has the most.

Delightful little tile laying and worker placement game.

Plays in maybe 5 minutes.  Setup and teardown are a matter of seconds each.  Take it out of the box and it is ultra portable.

I far prefer it solo as depending on the other player there could be a lot of down time... even though that makes it a high score game.

English rules are available as an attractive and well translated PDF.

Have to remember to try the advanced scoring one of these days!

RATING: 8
While a brief description (lay a tile, place a meeple on your tile) sounds VERY much like Carcassonne, this is a different feeling game. Every tile has four zones that feature a mix of up to four territories - fields, forests, water, and towers. One player shuffles their deck of tiles and drafts one every turn. The other player finds the drafted tile and both players add the same tile to their personal tableau, which will end up as a 4x4 square at the end of the game. Players have 7 meeples which they can optionally play on one of the territories on the tile just played OR they can move a meeple previously placed to an adjacent territory. At game's end, you will score for every territory that has a meeple somewhere on it and each territory scores a bit differently. 

Shaping your tableau and moving meeples to optimize your scoring for larger territories as they evolve is quite the fun puzzle, especially for those of us who like puzzley sorts of games.

Pretty simple but good game. I'd describe it as "Karuba meets Carcassone".
You have a stack of tiles. One player shuffles his stack, then draws. Both players play the drawn tile (they're numbered so the others can play their copy of the same tile). Then either place a meeple or move one.
That's basically it.

At the end you get a lovely little 4*4 grid. If the last few tiles didn't end up being so messy, you'd get a pretty nice looking picture :3

Simple but interesting game. Possibly more a solo game than a two player as what the other player does has almost zero effect on you past deciding the starting card. The mechanics are easy to learn and the game plays quickly. pretty much a filler length but with enough going on to get you thinking and planning. Deciding where the last 3 or 4 card go is harder than you might imagine.

We played three games of this in a row the first evening we got it and its an instant hit with my wife.  

Grabbed at UK Games Expo 2014 from Meeples Corner.

Reviewing solo play here: I don't think I expected to like it that much but here we are - this is a fun, brain-burny experience in 10 minutes with zero setup - after shuffling 24 cards and taking the meeples out you are already playing the game. Getting good scores isn't that hard, getting great ones can be - still, I feel an additional category after "excellent" would be nice so to give more goals to achieve (BGG helps with that - I now know 60 is a goal for some people and more could be possible in a best-case scenario so I still have an incentive to try).

It's also worth noting there are some additional rules and print and play tiles on the game's official website, including rules for a different, more complex scoring.

[u]02-Jul-2015[/u]:  Oh my, has this just taken over my gaming time by storm!  I've only had the game for six weeks or so, and I've already got almost thirty plays.  Granted, the game does play super quick (10 minutes or so) and has no setup time.  It's a small deck of cards and some meeples; that's it.  It's theme is there if you really want it to be, but to be honest it's almost a straight up abstract...and there is definitely nothing wrong with that.

The player draws one card at a time and adds it to his 4x4 tableau.  Then, you may either place a meeple or move a meeple already in the tableau.  Once the tableau is complete, you score VPs based upon the placement of your meeples.  It's simple.  It looks great.  And it's a ton of puzzly fun.

And I haven't even tried out the "pro" rules yet, which look like they amp up the gamer factor to the game.  Can't wait!

I even made the effort to set up a PBF geeklist ([geeklist=191896][/geeklist]) for us solo gamers to play the game together.  Be sure to join in if/when you have the game.  That's the great part...you can play when you please.

Solo play initial thoughts: after 4 games back to back, I have to say that I enjoy this immensely. I like the thinky-thinky bits of where to place the tiles (I kept having to refer to the rule book to remind me how to score that darned woodcutter!) and I like that feeling of "YES!" when the tile I need pops up. I do have a bit of AP initially, especially when I have to decide whether or not to commit a meeple, and sometimes I just give up and place a tile randomly because I'm tired of pondering. It's like things don't become clear until I complete the grid and I'm ready to score, so I don't have a strategy at all, but I'm hoping more plays will fix this.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]Thankfully both of my critiques of Cities have been addressed in Limes, the re-implementation of the former game. In Limes all four of the landscape types score differently [i](in Cities the four types of tiles only scored in two ways)[/i]. Also the horrible artwork of Cities has been replaced and with much better artwork even if it is a bit generic. Also the rule book is much clearer in Limes, making it a breeze to learn. 

With Limes the publisher went with cards instead of  tiles, but it doesn't bother me since the cards have a nice linen finish and are easy to shuffle. Limes is a great compliment to Kingdomino, while they may appear to be very similar they actually play very differently. Hopefully Limes will see a US release at some point since it is currently very difficult to find a copy.[/i]

Little puzzle game. Inspired by Carcassonne and then copied by other games like Kingdomino and Honshu and probably more. Nice quick filler for two.

A fun time killer, two player game. It is very transportable and presents an entertaining tile-laying puzzle.

For me personally this - pure abstract - game misses a soul, it misses fun. Can be good as a solo-game I think.

Karuba + Carcassonne. Bingo style simultaneous tile laying and puzzle solving. Place meeples on various tile features which have accompanying scoring rules. Highly portable.
-Multiplayer solitaire, AP prone (especially w/some of the variant rules). Doesn't really seem all that fun, compare to Dingo's Dream, Karuba, Augustus. Limited availability.

Everyone calls it Carcassonne crossed with Take it Easy, but that’s because it is. I’d rather play either of those any day though.

Incredibly enjoyable and addictive little solo game. If I had owned a copy myself I would have played many, many, many more games of this. Super easy and fast to set up and take down, easy to play, extremely portable. And very enjoyable to play. A little bit like Carcassonne - but different and plays well solo right out of the box.

We like this interesting Carcassonne-esque tile laying game. Simple rules, just play your tile against an adjacent feature, then place or move a meeple if you wish to control a given territory that you score for VPs. Its a fun and quick 2P game as you map out your 16 tile grid. The tiles, actually cards, comprise your own map. One critique is there is not much player interaction, mostly simultaneous solitaire, but my wife likes that more than attack games. Worth checking out, I could only find it from German and UK sellers, but I'd say it's worth the effort to acquire.

Tile laying game. A bit boring.
Fast game, so that is ok. But the decisions made are not really that interesting. The aspect of making better use of the same materials than your opponents is fascinating in theory, in practice it does not matter so much.

A nice little solo game. There are better games for two players. Rating it as a solo game.

Rating 5 or 6. Since there is no interaction, there is no real competition. Might be a good solo game and great for friendly couples. I'll play it sporadically. My gaming group is in two mind about it, some love it, some think it is lame. Now that the expansion "Start Cards" is released, I give it a 6.

RATING: 8.5
Purely abstract game similar in looks to Carcassonne. Easy to learn, easy to play yet engaging enough to keep me interested. There are lots of tough choices during taking those cards and trying to think where to place them.

The one thing I absolutely love on this as a 2p game is that it's pure skill competition. You have exactly the same deck as your opponent and the only difference is how you think out your moves. Pure competition, no chance involved. Love that.

Also this game has a very high replay value, since you have 24 cards, the order matters, and you use only 16 out of those each game... Almost limitless possibilities.

As a solo game this is a good brain exercise. If you write down the order of the cards, you can even beat your own score and try to better yourself.

And if you think this game has nothing to offer, there are tons of variants including pro scoring methods on the official website which gives tons of new decisions and things to calculate with in your play. Nicely done.

Good variants listed on Martyn F's website. Might need to try pro and one last card versions. (I think I'm playing the rules correctly now.)

Best solo score is 61.

RATING: 9
A frequent filler at my table.  It's an improvement over Cities mildly in play (better scoring and movement rules), but majorly in looks!  I own two sets so we can play three- and four-player, which works best with the promo Start Cards Set A.

This is very light, but it's not easy to score 50+ points. It's surprising each time I play how many choices there actually are, and you can always realize where you did poorly at the end of a play. Plays in about 5 minutes too, which is a big plus.

Simple but semi thought involved tile laying game.  

Starting with 1 startcard (set A), my wife and I like to use the same 15 cards each  but mix them up before we play.  So we each have the same deck of cards, but rarely do we draw the same card at the same time.

A classic couples' game, i.e. it's easy enough for a non-gamer spouse to play, you build your own board, and it's about gentle non-direct competition. I found it 'meh' and too tame.

Not citrus farmers? It's a tile placing card game city builder of Romans providing for the village while keeping a watchful eye for Barbarians. It plays like a Bingo-Carcassonne hybrid. The lead player draws a random tile and the other player(s) pull the same matching tile to place on their own 4x4 grid. As the city tiles are placed with lakes, forest, farmland, and towers, meeples can be added or moved between areas for scoring combos. Increase the puzzle building challenge by using advanced scoring variations. I like thee concept of adding infinite copies of the game to play more people. Conceivably, game length for two people would take as long as a game with 2,000 people. That is pretty cool. It is much like multi-player solitaire. I worry that only 24 tiles with everyone placing the same would get samey? But, I like that everyone is competing on a perfectly level playing field to create the optimum scoring combination using identical tiles and resources. And, with simultaneous play, everyone is engaged through every one of the 16 tile draws.

This nice, little game gives me the same relaxing feeling of Carcassonne. Never played it solo, I think this is a very nice 2-player game for the evenings when you want to play something, but you are not in the mood for something too complicated.

Bingo, tile-laying, spatial awareness. This hits quite a few of my sweet spots and does it in such a fun way. There's not really much more I could ask for in a game which plays so quickly. This one really punches above its weight.

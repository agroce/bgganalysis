This is basically the game Speed (that was played with a regular deck of cards). If that kind of game is your type of thing then you'll probably like this game and it scales from 2-4 players. I was fine to play it a time or two, but it's not really what I'm looking for in a game.

Thoughts: Great speed game! I've played hundreds of games and for some reason the only way I can beat my wife is by stacking. Ironically she won't let me teach new players the rules for stacking unless they've played more than a dozen games. That's okay though because I have a great marriage by letting her win this one.

I own 2 copies.  I likely paid $1 for my garage sale copy.
I believe I received my good copy as a Christmas gift.  It has been used somewhat.  We now own Perpetual Commotion, which alters the rules slightly and allows for more players.  I grew up playing Double Solitaire using standard playing cards, with 2 or more players.  That's still my favourite version of this family of games.  I do well at it.  Double Solitaire can stall out quite often though.

RATING: 6
It continually shocks me that Crokinole, a game I played at my Granparent's as a kid, is rated 37 overall.  I would be no more suprised than if I discovered that, by popular opinion, Monopoly or Risk was considered about as good as board games got.  It's a good game, but not so good that it deserves a significant number of people thinking it's a better game than Settlers (which, presumably, they do, given the games' proximity on the list).  

What shocks me even more is that Dutch Blitz, this other excellent game from my childhood, is relegated to the thousands.  While perhaps not as good as Crokinole, my family would tend to go back and forth between the two, viewing them in a more-or-less equal light.  It's fast, easy to learn, and a delight to play.  While strategy doesn't play a role to speak of, it isn't clear that strategy is a large component of Crokinole either.  Admittedly, the game is mostly about speed of hand and how perceptive one is, but this shouldn't really be a problem, since these are as reasonable to make a game about as anything else.  All in all, I think it's a great game, and seriously under-rated.

Dutch Blitz edition.  A commercial variation of the extremely fast paced "Nertz" or "Pounce" (also known as [gameid=14001]) which can be played with a regular deck.  Beware: [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/123872]women[/url] are especially good at high speed games like this!

Best with 4 or more, decent with 3, less good with 2

Note: as posted [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/article/19336685#19336685]here[/url] it is legal to move cards (even a stack) from one post pile to another.

This game is crazy fun, I love it, and it has the added benefit of being immediately understood by almost anyone, at least anyone who's played traditional Solitaire/Klondike/Patience.

The one big problem with this game is that it doesn't play more than 4, and that the 3 player game, in my experience, introduces an unacceptable risk of stalemate.

Additionally, even in the 4 player version, if there are players at the table who play poorly, or miss obvious moves, or bury important cards in their dutch piles, then it can drag on occasionally, even though I don't believe you will hit a true stalemate.

I loathe this game. There isn't much control over what you can do, and it's another one of those games that can be ruined by someone's hoarding piles toward themselves. It just isn't fun for me, although I see that others may love the fast pace and frantic movements.

If you're playing with players who are much better than you at this game, you may dislike it and feel overwhelmed by their blazing speed.  It's like Speed and Skip-Bo at the same time.

This game plays like a game of Flinch, but in high gear, with a bit of contact.

The basic game is, like Flinch, to get rid of the pile of 10 Cards you start with (the Blitz deck), but playing onto common build piles (Dutch piles), starting with a 1 and ending with a 10, by color/suit.

Furthermore, unlike Flinch there are no turns- everyone plays as fast as possible until someone goes out.

Finally, the points scored per hand are the total number of cards played into Dutch piles, less 2x #remaining Blitz cards.

Because of the speed of it all, that doesn't add the same amount of strategy that, say Gin Rummy adds to Gin, but it adds some interest to the staid old game of Flinch.

I liked the changes- my wife, not as much.

This is another game where my plays here do not represent the hours spent playing a game with playing cards called Nertz, which I always explained to new players as duelling solitaire. Dutch Blitz is either the game Nertz is based on or a game based on whatever other game Nertz was based on. We'd play in teams or individually and it was always awesome. I was happy to find a way to invigorate Nertz and give it new life. Unfortunately, neither my boyfriend nor my most frequent gaming partner like it that much.

Dutch Blitz takes games like Skip-Bo and jumps them up to a new level.  What I like more about Dutch Blitz than the aforementioned Skip-Bo is the real-time play and taking out the element of solitaire.  You are still able to play cards on yourself, but a huge part of winning the game is getting your cards into the community stacks.  It's not great, but it's a lot of fun, for sure.

An excellent game of speed and card-stacking, found under other names (with slight rules differences) like Nerts and Ligretto. The design has a classic Dutch look to it, with bright colors to differentiate the suits, and this pack can accommodate up to four players. An expansion pack exists with additional decks to increase the number to eight. If you want more, though, you'll have to switch to a different version (Ligretto can handle up to 12, Nerts as many as you have different card backs), which is a pity. The main drawback to this version is that it can be tricky to differentiate between boy cards and girl cards when playing at speed, which is necessary for stacking properly (cards in front of you should be stacked boy-girl-boy-girl).

Only played this a few times one night and while it was fun against the only other person who was good at it (she apparently played it obsessively in her youth) due to my highly competitive nature, I really don't think this is a game that will stand the test of time for me. Maybe, but probably not. I could see enjoying it with my kids though.

In Dutch Blitz, each player has her own deck of forty cards, with cards 1-10 in four colors; red and blue cards show a Pennsylvania Dutch boy, while yellow and green cards show a Pennsylvania Dutch girl. Each deck has a different symbol on the back to aid with card sorting between rounds.

I love this speedy card game as a break in between deeper and more complex games.  Racing other people in getting cards out in sequence and beating someone to the punch is always a good time and then being able to yell "BLITZ" first takes the cake.  Sure it gets chaotic but its just a good ole time.  Easily played with 3-8 players; I really like playing with partners.  Played this game a ton growing up and just enjoyed the satisfaction of beating my older brothers and sister...:-)

Felt like solitaire with a twist. The game stalled frequently because neither of us could put out cards.  We played 2-player, so maybe it’s better with more people, but it felt very dependent upon luck of the draw whether the game could even more forward or not.

Fast, fun game that can get pretty cantankerous as the race goes on. This has potential to be a 7 or even a 10 with the right crowd and setting. 

I would like to see the expansion change to a new color palette, though. As it is, even expansion decks have to be marked by many people to tell them apart.

Full contact dexterity card game. This one is fun when all players have similar dexterity levels (i.e. not a game to share with young ones or grandparents). Players simultaneously play their cards ("woodpiles") in a common play area as fast as possible. The first one out yells "Dutch Blitz!" and gameplay ends for that round. Each card left in other players woodpiles count as -2 points and each card played that round in the play area counts as +1 point. First to 75 wins! This game is fun, fast, and easy! When we play, we make everybody remove their rings so nobody gets hurt (as much) when two players' hands collide while trying to play the same common pile. Like I said, a "full contact" card game... you have been warned :)

Incredibly light. Almost an activity more than a game as there is very little decision space. The allure is in the speed, stress, and the "gotcha" moments as you compete to place cards.

01/12/2013: This is a great family game.  Portable.  Fast.  Easy to play.  This is one of the few games that we are competitive about.  Each player has their own color coded (backs only) deck of cards.  You can play cards in your own area or in the common area in the middle of the table, but you only score points for the ones in the common area.  All card fronts are one of four colors and numbered 1 to 10.  In the common area you build cards up from 1 to 10 in the same color.  In your own area you build cards down from 10 to 1 but alternating male and female (there are pictures of a girl or boy on them).  A round ends when one play depletes their initial stack of 10 cards.  Add up the number of cards you played in the middle (regardless of the number printed on them) and subtract twice(!) the number remaining in your original stack of 10.

It may sound a little wacky written down in the paragraph above, but this is a fun, fast game.  You are not only racing to get your stack of 10 cards as low as possible, but at the same time trying to play cards in the common area beating the other players to put out that yellow 5 or whatever.

We really enjoy this game as it's not too thinky but still challenging.  This is a solid game night choice for our family.

There is a LOT going on in this game -- and very quickly. You're building solitaire hands, but pay attention to the boy/girl symbols, which must alternate. You're building stacks in the common area -- but you have to keep track of your hand, the other players' hands, and your reserve stacks to play from. The end-of-game condition is depleting the blitz pile, but point allocation depends on what's played to the center. Did I mention there's a lot going on? And that it's fast?

Dutch blitz is a fast paced card game, best played with 4. The rules are quite easy and the mechanics of having three piles to manipulate as well as a central tableau to play into takes some getting used to. However, after one round most people understand how it works but it takes a good bit of mental gymnastics to keep an eye on the ever changing central tableau and play off cards into it first.

The one downside to the game is that there is no way to play the game carefully enough to avoid wear and tear to the cards. Speed is of essence and I expect that Dutch Blitz cards will wear out the fastest for a given number of games. Sleeving is unlikely to help as sleeving will make handling the cards unwieldy.

Such a great game. It has elements of some of my favourite card games, and I suspect that it could be played with just multiple, standard, 52 playing card decks. The printed rules are *awful*, in that I can’t recall coming across a ruleset that is worse than this one. It’s such a simple game and yet it describes elements of the game in a manner that is so unnecessarily complicated, and fails to cover parts of the game like; what do you do when you get to the end of your Wood Pile and you only have one or two cards left?
Admittedly not having what’s supposed to happen defined didn’t stop us from playing it, but it would be nice to know what’s supposed to happen. As it was, we just discussed options and agreed upon the version we thought would maximise gameplay - that being that you add the leftover cards to the top of your woodpile and start dealing out new groups of threes as the extra cards at the top now mean new cards in the woodpile will come up.

Players each have their own deck of 40 cards (cards numbered 1-10 in four colors) and simultaneously play as fast as they can to a common center area while at the same time managing their own card piles, very much like double solitaire with a standard deck of cards. An excellent light diversion. The special expansion deck is needed allow 5-8 people to play.

It's kind of like you are playing a giant game of solitaire where you are trying to play your cards faster than everyone else. It requires an interesting level of awareness because you need to be looking at your cards while simultaneously looking at the communal stacks of cards to see when you can play your card. Maybe you have the red 7 and there is a red stack at 5, so you are waiting for someone else to play the red 6. Then you need to play your red 7 before someone else does.

It's a good speed-based filler if that's what you're into. That's not really my style of game, so I'd be fine if I never played it again.

Fast family fun game. Played it growing up, and I'd still play it, but now it's just kind of okay.

I've always loved this game, but it's hit or miss if i'll be in the mood. I like to relax when playing a game most of the time and this does not work for me. But every so often I like my card games to give me an adrenaline rush.

This is pure reflex and luck. I don't mind it now and again, but there are better fillers for me.

I like the art a little more for Dutch Blitz than Ligretto. Lauren still kicks my butt at it though.

Not so hot on pure speed games. This is tame Spoons.

Fast and fun game I most closely associate with being a 4-player Spit.

We drink and play Nertz.  A favorite of my wife.  You can play with multiple decks of regular playing cards. If you like speed games you should play this.

This gets a rating of 4 for me not because it is not a good filler, but just that it is not a filler for me. The game is a dexterity/speed pattern recognition game with lots of people trying to deplete a pile of cards in their tableau. I can potentially get better at this but I feel this is not something I love. The pattern recognition aspect is just not my cup of tea.

Played this at a women's retreat 2016.  It was a little bit confusing to learn but was fun once I caught on.  I'd like to play again before deciding whether to buy it or not.

Love it, exciting, energetic, lots of yelling and screaming at our table. Shuffling gets tedious.

Never expected to like this game. And then the entire night has gone the way of the Buggy, Bucket, Pump and Plow. Great for fun and quick cursing.

I found this to be more fun and entertaining than I had guessed.  It required keen observation, some creative yet simple strategizing, and hand speed.  I'm looking forward to playing it again.

Lots of fun, especially with 4-6 players. Two-player games can be a little slow and often you have to start over, as people run out of plays. But every time someone asks, "You want to play Dutch Blitz?" I never say no. Note that cards take a lot of abuse, so you'll need sleeves or just plan on buying another set.

Classic fast paced game, must stand to play.

RATING: 5
I am truly awful at this game, but I remain optimistic that - one day - I won't come in last. Rating is a soft 5, since I could be talked into playing again - just not for an extended period of time.

Dutch Blitz is an imperfect design, but the simultaneous play (when the game doesn't lock up) keeps things spastic, dangerous, and lighthearted.

Fun to play, but I'm apparently slower than everybody else in my family. Would prefer something else, but won't refuse to enjoy the fun that can go with it.

My wife and daughter are good at this game and love it. It drives me crazy. It gets all my competative juices flowing and I can't win, leaving me angry and defeated.

a card-trasher.  kinda fun concept though a real-time game like this mostly leads to fingernail slashes.

simple, hectic, can be taught in 5 minutes. Pretty shallow, but can burn through a few rounds before some deeper games.

I rediscovered this game-from-my-youth at a little game con in Goshen IN recently.  Surprisingly fun.  

I didn't realize as a kid how cheap and crappy the cards are.

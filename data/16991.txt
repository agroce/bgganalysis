Only played 3 times so far, but is very cool. Certainly Chess-esque with a dash of Ricochet Robot thrown in. Definitely a slower paced games with lots of careful planning, but the turns don't seem too long because you're happy to have the extra time to think. I'm sure after a few more plays certain moves will become standard, like the "Obelisk Gambit" opening. With limited types of pieces long term replay is a bit of a question for me, but I think I'll enjoy it for a long while yet. 

ps. it has a laser (added .5 to the rating)

RATING: 5.5
Lasers bouncing off mirrors - a fine and fun gimmick. It's surprisingly simple in rules - all the pieces move pretty much the same - yet complex in the unfolding strategy. It is a decent abstract too - although that means a ton of analysis paralysis. I'm fairly certain there are good opening moves and known counter moves as you gain experience with the game - but this is offset by a variety of set ups. So all in all, not bad, but not a game I'll suggest to play.

Fast paced fun for 2-3 matches. Then you get bored and put the game back into the bookshelf for the next 12 months. Not a bad game at all but just a little short lived.

Khet tries to use a neat technological trick (a laser) to make a cool game. Sure it is fun for short time but quite soon you realize how shallow the game actually is. I'd describe it best as a kind of programming challenge, that is route the laser beam using a variety of programming blocks (mirrors). 

I reckon Khet is better suited for elementary school kids who love lasers and can actually learn logical thinking from the game.

Egyptian Chess with OMGWTFLASERS?! There's a Khet 2.0 out, and I'm considering purchasing that. I love the idea of lasers of destroying pieces off the board! It's also customizable with a tower you can add as well as another piece that allows lasers to go through AND bends the laser at the same time! Pretty neat concept. I beat all my friends, so I've yet to find anyone locally to play. Hope that changes soon!

RATING: 5
Cool idea for a game but it has a couple of strikes against it. One, I don't really like abstracts. And two, the lasers don't always make it around the board due to the mirrors occasionally not being aligned properly. I've had laser beams leave the playing field occasionally.

I don't always like "Sudden death" abstracts, but, like Hive, this one is quick enough that you can set up and play again when you make a mistake. The laser "gimmick" is quite clever-- obviously you'd have to play a lot to figure out how deep the strategy is.

perhaps part chess and part ricochet robots?  the line aspect reminds me of the latter.  i'd like it to be smaller in general, but it's not a big complaint for me.  especially since i'm probably going to set it up as an installation in my office.  i need to play it again while i'm still invested in it, and finally get around to the alternate starting layout because the basic one seems a bit too telegraphed.  update: too late now, already sold.

I figured a game with lasers would just end up a gimmick, but I was surprised to find that there is actually a nice abstract game at the heart of this offering.  Sure the laser is gimmicky, but its kinda cool and it gets people's attention.  Dim the lights a tad and add in a little fog machine to help highlight the laser beam and you're sure to find yourself drawn into the game.  Play time is a good length - long enough to show development of strategy, but still short enough to permit repeated plays to test different approaches.

Fun, high tech, chess-like game.  Kids really like it.  Basic game can sometimes seem a little slow to develop, but game lends itself to mixing things up a bit with variants (knight-like moves for pyramids, allowing obelisks to capture pieces, developing a few one-time use special move cards, etc.).  Hey, it has lasers, it's worth a little effort to keep it interesting.

[i]Posted: 3/31/08, Rated: 7[/i]

There's no doubt about it: playing a board game with freakin' [i]lasers[/i] is cool!  The idea is just so übergeeky that you have to love it.  If you can't have aliens, orcs, or sharks, then pieces with mirrors which can deflect and redirect the beams are the next-best things.

The pieces themselves are not complicated.  Learning how to "see" where the laser is going to travel shouldn't be difficult, either, yet my sons have trouble with this aspect of the game.  The default layout is very enjoyable, and in my experience is the best of the suggested ones.  The ancient Egyptian "theme" is implemented about as well as it could be for an anachronistic game with lasers.

The real shortcoming of [i]Khet[/i] is that while lasers are cool, the abstract game itself is only mediocre.  Playing the game without lasers -- which admittedly doesn't make sense, although I suppose you could "draw" the path with your finger from piece to piece -- would be less fulfilling than any of the games in the [family=10]Project GIPF family[/family].  After several plays with overenthusiastic children, I'm starting to suspect either my lasers or my pieces aren't as well-aligned as they used to be.  Multi-bounce shots aren't as precise.

In all fairness, [i]Khet[/i] probably deserves a rating of "6," but I'm going to give it a courtesy bump up to a "7" because my sons love playing the "laser battle game."  And lasers [i]are[/i] wicked cool, after all.

Absolutley fantastic. It has so much strategy while still being amazingly simple to learn or teach. And come on, let's face it IT HAS LASERS!

Khet is probably my favorite two-player filler, It's a fast playing and combines both strategy and tactics. The production values are fantastic and the game looks very good when set up. The different set ups (and the ability to design your own) give the game near-infinate replay-ability. I think this game could be one for the ages.

It was easier for me to "get it" spatially speaking than Chess but it still felt very difficult for me to plan moves and carry them out.

Fun but kitschy, for all but the real g33ks out there the laser factor wears off all-too-quickly.  Having attacks come from two points reflected around the game board makes for some interesting strategy, but although the pieces take no movement influence directly from chess itself, the game boils down to nothing more than a chess variant.

(streamlined) Chess with frickin' lasers!!

The lasers aren't just a gimmick, although the game could be played without them.  The game is built around lining up your riquochet shots and avoiding your opponents.

And it's got Lasers!!  (Firing sound effects must be added manually)


UPDATE: I was sad to see them change the color scheme for this on the remake.  The alienated me as an early adopter of the game.

My rating is based on one play and my desire to play the game, not the quality of the game. I just don't "see" the paths and didn't enjoy trying.  It looks like it is a fairly decent game built around the gimmick and one I would enjoy *if* I could see the laser's path in my head.

I'm not big on pure abstracts, and this is very chess-like, having to implement a long-term plan while still responding tactically to the opponents' moves. But this one has lasers! You can't go wrong with lasers. And I won my first game on my second move.

I'm not big fan of abstracts, and I equate chess to "my-guys-vs-your-guys and the 1st to make a mistake loses".

Its chess with lasers and mirrors. Being a novice at chess that translates to a novice at this but it still is fun. The trouble I have is when the lasers are not perfectly aligned or the mirrors aren't balanced correctly and the beam starts to divert and isn't centered. However, ANYONE who thinks he is too cool for games wouldn't think twice about playing this. IT just looks too cool to pass up.

This game is worth owning for its unique design alone. I know it's based on an old video game called Laser Chess but porting reality to video games is easier than porting video games to reality. One negative point: when a higher number of pieces are involved in the laser deflection, the beam tends to lose its target. This inconvenience is offset by the batteries being included in the packaging :)

[b]Khet[/b] is an abstract game where you try to illuminate your opponent's pharaoh with a laser by bouncing the beam off of your pieces and your opponent's pieces.

It could be a lot of fun... if it worked.

After four or five deflections, the beam leaves the board.  It's pretty frustrating when you are trying to figure out what the beam is highlighting to finally notice that your cup of coffee sitting beside the board is now aglow.

[b]Update:[/b]  I emailed the manufacturer and they sent me a complete replacement set of mirrored pieces.  Apparently, there were some production problems with the alignment of the mirrors on the pieces.  But they sent the pieces all jumbled up together in a large bubble envelope without any additional protection, so some of the mirrors got scratched.

But even with the scratched mirrors, the laser alignment has been improved.  I still have a couple bad mirrors that deflect the laser very poorly, but now I can usually get 6 or 7 deflections.  An vast improvement.  The game is now playable and really is fun.  

The biggest drawback though is the actual size of the game.  It takes a lot of shelf space.  That, coupled with the fact that it is only a good game, not a great game, makes me want to trade this off in the near future.

UPDATE: Kick the rating up to an 8 if you play with the Eye of Horus beamsplitter. That piece really makes the game, making it much more dynamic and interesting. It should have been in the base set.
---
Now that I've played a few times, I've bumped up my rating; the pace of the game is slow, and positions take a while to laboriously build up, but that's not inherently a problem and there is definitely a clever game in there. And the gimmick (the laser) is of course wonderful. Not sure if its ultimately a good buy or not more most gamers - you get good value for the money in terms of quality and quantity of bits, but it still isn't cheap - but if you're drawn to unusual games, and don't mind abstracts, check it out. Does it have anything, gamewise, on the GIPF-series games? Probably not, but it is also more accessible, and it's got a laser. You can get people to play - once, anyway - just by breaking it out.

Yet another abstract that I don't really enjoy.  However, the idea of an abstract game that incorporates lasers and mirrors is to be applauded, and really makes for a brain-burny exercise!

Very nice abstract game with the gameworlds coolest gimmick. Takes a play to wrap your head around the zillion possibilities. Absolute brain melter. I do think there is a superior strategy, which I think holds it back a tad. Need to try the beam-splitter expansion to see if it fixes it.

RATING: 10
Possibly the best abstract strategy game ever invented.  Even without the laser, this game would be a 10.  Also check out Black Box, it has a similar laser and mirror strategy.  Rather than using the laser to destroy enemy pieces, you use the laser to deduce an object's location (except you have to imagine the laser beam and how it would reflect or absorb).

RATING: 7
This game is a mirrors-and-lasers version of chess, and I love the concept (note that I did not call it a gimmick!!).  It's pretty simple to learn and introduce to people who don't play "strategy" board games but are familiar with 2-player abstract games.  However, like chess, it suffers from analysis paralysis, and a timer might come in handy.  The box for this game is (necessarily) huge though--if it weren't for that, I would probably bring this game to gaming meetings as a starter game while waiting for a full game of people to show up/finish up.

RATING: 3
Rating may rise half a point on further plays (3 so far), faint possibility of rising a whole point.  The laser is a sales gimmick that adds no game mechanic quality.  Ultimately the game is one of ply analysis with some strong pattern recognition elements in trimming the decision tree.  Not bad for a game of this type, but not great either.

The laser gimmick is pretty cool. The movement rules for the pieces helps to create a pretty cool little abstract...but I don't think its in the class with the Gipf games in terms of elegance. My son, however, is totally captivated by the lasers. OK, I am too.

Great game.
The lasers can go off-target if reflected too many times, but otherwise it's a nice thinking game that can be over pretty fast if you don't pay attention.
Neat idea, nicely executed.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I'm not a big fan of abstracts and I found some of the geometry in the game mindboggling, but this is a fun game nonetheless.  Unlike most abstracts it has a nice sense of drama when you fire the laser and kill something.  It's a really cool idea, executed very nicely.  Some variations might make this one rate a little higher but as it stands- not bad at all.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

(2007-12-24) Interesting strategy game that has no luck elements.  My son enjoys it.  I find it more engaging that other luckless games.

(2007-12-28) My son and I tried this with the beam splitter pieces this evening.  I think he liked seeing the different paths it followed more than actually playing the game, which is a little beyond him right now.  I thought they detracted from the base game.

RATING: 7
Similar to chess in that it rewards repeated play and the ability to visualize the board several moves ahead.  However, it is much easier to pick up and learn than chess, since all pieces have the same basic possible moves with just different physical properties.

And it has lasers!

Eh. I think the rule that you fire your laser is kind of silly. Seems better to force each player to keep track of what's going on.

RATING: 3
Cool idea, but after a single game at the Spellenspektakel 2007-convention I realised this game simply is not for me. Part of the reason is that you don't see the path of the laser unless you blow smoke in the game arena: now it's just a tiny red dot on a game piece or the black border. There is no ominous buzzing sound or weird fluorescence. That also means that memorising the path the laser is going to take is hard: you are continuously drawing the path in your mind over and over again. Make one mistake here and you lose. There is a certain satisfaction in seeing the pharaoh of your opponent getting hit as planned, but with so many pieces on the board I was mostly concerned with working out ways to avoid my own pieces getting hit until I lost. This is of course a beginner's stupid mistake, but at the same time I was left with a 'Is that it?'-feeling which I interpreted as 'I'm not interested in this game any more'. It has a clear chess-like nature to it (as in 'kill of a number of pieces so the rest can begin to walk freely'), but given the rather steep price of 65 euros and Go around the corner which scratches the same itch without the gadgetry... Regrettably, but no.

An abstract with a gimmick so enticing you can get almost anyone to try it at least once.  

It can be hard to glean what you opponent is trying to accomplish, and since it usually takes several moves to set up traps, it's all to easy to get tunnel vision, focusing on your own machinations while disregarding mounting threats.  Thus, game over often feels  unexpected, at least for the loser.  That's not a bad thing at all, but for newbies, allowing a mulligan or two couldn't hurt.  This game definitely requires your undivided attention.  And deserves it too!

Lasers! Mirrors! Actual engaging gameplay! Freakin' cool, even if I don't pull it out much. (More because the box is large enough that it's stuffed up on a shelf where I forget about it than because I don't want to play.) Much like chess, games can take a while if you don't have some sort of time cap, though early games tend to end abruptly. ("Whoops, didn't see that one.")

Pretty enjoyable chess type of game, with lasers of all things. The science geeks are going to enjoy using lasers and mirrors, but the main negatives for me is the annoyance of resetting the game using the original styro inserts (requires a specific map setup) and that games against players of similar skill get a bit samey. Might rate higher though if I got to play it more often.

Not a bad game, but with a less flashy presentation would be unremarkable. There is a slight first player advantage in my experience. Also be aware than many of the mirrors are tilted back a little so after a few reflections the cumulative deviation can send the beam over the wall. We were playing on the floor and a stray beam almost hit our cat in the face.

The laser gimmick is problematic: the construction is not precise enough to keep the beam centered after five or so deflections. Also, with the suggested first setup, a passive, defensive strategy seems impenetrable absent a blunder. Some of the other setups may make for a more open game.

An abstract game, sort of resembling Chess.  Players take turns moving a piece, which can physically move 1 space, or if it's mirrored, rotate 90 degrees in place.  After a move, the player fires their laser from their side of the board, and watch to see where the beam hits.  If it finishes on a piece, that piece is removed.  The object is to hit the opponent's pharaoh piece with the laser.  Fun game that isn't too deep.  Some of the pieces have an extra ability (stack, exchange places, etc).  Seems to be rather too easy to get your opponent reacting to your threats, but it's early days.

This is a fascinating game and yes, like everybody else, I give it bonus points for having frickin' lasers.  A game doesn't take more than five or ten minutes to play and there are crazy reversals of fortune where you can have an aha! moment and spot a winning move bounced off of eight different pieces.

For a little while I tried to make moves that would force my opponent to take out his own pieces with his own laser but they're too easy to avoid.  Sticking to using my own laser offensively worked best for me.

The gadget is really cool, but I find it too hard to read-ahead, mostly due to the fact that you have to follow two different paths, one starting from each laser.

Khet is one of the earliest games I bought new from a store when I was just rediscovering board games.  It's quite brilliant - simple rules, chess-like advances, and the lasers work in a way that is much more than simply novel.  And a huge 'Wow!' factor to boot with the pretty design!  The best part about Khet is the struggle to balance offensive and defensive plays.  Most abstracts require such thinking but when I need to think of one that balances it well, Khet gets the marks.  It's too bad that this game doesn't get a better rank here.  It truly is a solid abstract.

I'm not a huge fan of abstracts but this one holds more interest for me because it has lasers!! It probably has a fair amount of depth but I'd rather play with people who, like me, are a bit more gung ho and just play to enjoy it rather than sit and analyse every move.

RATING: 6.75
An interesting little abstract, this one features on the gimmick of neon lasers and counters with mirrors as the relay method to attack and checkmate the opponent's Pharaoh.

A little faster and less deep than older abstracts, or GIPF games, the gimmick is still eye-catching, and fun to play with.

After a 1st game head-to-head I will give this a 6.75 for a decent game, but likely not one with enough staying power for me to wish to add it to my collection.

Nice confrontational abstract, so way overproduced. If it wasn't for the (real) laser, few would pay attention to it. It's more strategical than tactical, they way of thinking is different from chess/shogi, and plays quite slow.

My college dissertation was about optics, so I couldn't help but to buy it. Wow, this game is HUGE.

UPDATE: Sold. Wasn't hitting the table much, and its box was huge.

RATING: 7
Awesome concept, bits are pretty well calibrated (necessary for a game with lasers).  It is easy to play, so it was not long before it felt played out.  I often wish there were pieces with farther movement to make it more dynamic.

Chess on steroids.  And it has lasers!  Who wouldn't like a game with lasers?  My son and I truly enjoy this one.  There is lots of strategy.  Shooting the laser at the end of each move keeps the game fun and engaging.  I'm not crazy about chess because it is so deep and DRY, but khet is remarkably fun.

Who could resist a game that involves shooting a laser? Well, put that idea aside, this game is by no means as exciting as that. This is a slow, analytical abstract, if you like Chess and want something lighter then you'll probably like this. The rest of us will probably notice the mediocre build quality and the fact that the lasers don't necessarily line up on the mirrors after a few bounces. In short, a gimmick game, a novelty for a few plays, but not a purchase.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
 A solid game that feels a lot like chess. While it isn't that mechanically similar it captures much of the calculation aspect as well as the harsh punishment of a single mistake. I will need to play it more to get a better feel for the game, but overall it seemed solid.

This game is awesome!  The board and bits are quite large and make you feel like you're playing something really grand.

Still wish I had a smoke machine so I could see the laser bounce around everywhere...

The cool factor is, well, cool as suspected, but I’m not sure the game lived up to my expectations, and that is likely my own fault for not getting to play it for like 7 years after I knew about it.

Abstract are definitely not my favorite genre of games. With that being said, Deflexion is fun and a brain burner at the same time. While I won't want to play this all the time it will be fun to occasionally break this out and give it a go. If you like abstracts this should be right up your alley.  My only concern about the game is the battery life and durability of the lasers. Without them the game is useless.

The game takes a bit getting used to, but it's a helluva game once you figure it out.  The laser's only good for 5-6 bounces though, so on the rare occasion that it's supposed to deflect off more mirrors than that (a recent game I played it was supposed to bounce some 14 times!) you might have to trace what should be the laser's path with your finger, and have you and your opponent agree on that path.

After many plays dropped from a 10 to an 8. Still a very good game that I enjoy, but it does seem to get a little redundant after many games. It lacks the variety of Chess, Shogi, etc. Still, a fun brain burning abstract that doesn't take too long to play and that's fairly rare.

While I'm not usually a fan of abstracts, this has two lasers!  It's a very neat game - reminds me of Black Box, but more enjoyable.  I have a much harder time anticipating my opponent's moves than I do with other abstracts, but I still win just more than half the time.

This is a great game, it's just not for me.  Like chess, you need to be able to look several moves ahead to play well.  I had fun playing it a couple of times more or less randomly, but if I played it a lot I would want to be competetive, and I don't see that happening.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (July 2011)

It’s been years since I last played Khet, however I remember the game was very impressive. On 2011, I was still a newbie in many boardgaming issues and I have never seen a game with lasers, so that factor alone increased the game value in my eyes. The game components are very well done.

Khet is a two player abstract game. The rules are easy to explain and it plays quickly. I LOVE that you have to play in your mind before you press the button and if you miscalculate you can kill your own pieces :devil:. The game has a lot of depth, an experienced player will win most games (but that’s a plus for me).

My desire to play Khet is normal, I gifted my copy of the game, but I will perhaps buy it again in the future. The game still has a lot of appeal.

Got the game and the batteries that came with it corroded the connectors on one side of the board.  :(.  Contacted the store I got it from, we'll see if we can get a replacement.

Whooohooo!  Got a replacement.  Took the batteries out after playing.  I have some rechargeable double-A batteries.  I think I'll maybe start using those.  Otherwise I might just get a case.  A little bit of a pain to setup and break down, but hey, it's a game with lasers.

Pretty fun, although I have yet to determine how it really plays.  It feels like a balance of aggressive and defensive move.  I like it so far.

A simplified laser-chess game. The components were huge and well made (except for some reason, the battery holders were a bit too tight). Its certainly very easy to teach and play, but I am a little concerned about the AP involved. I would also have liked a bit more documentation with the game. Some ideas for taking care of the pieces, keeping the laser aligned, etc...

And I was extremely disappointed to find that you couldn't actually see the laser at work (although in retrospect, that was pretty silly of me). Still, it would've been nice...

This is a brain burning abstract similar to chess.  The goal is to capture the other person's pharaoh while capturing their other pieces in the process.

Deflexion is a nice abstract 2P game. One of my friends who likes chess really digs it. He said this was his favourite game that he has played from my collection.
He really likes the gameplay.

I like my abstracts and with someone fast playing like he it is a great game. If the game is played too slow it is not at all for me.

I rate this a seven. I can only think of a couple of players I want to play this one with. When I do I think I will allways enjoy it.

RATING: 5
Somewhat interesting abstract that feels different because you have to try to keep track of the two laser beams.  Unfortunately, the laser is not, as implied on the packaging, visible as it bounces from mirror to mirror.  The pure chrome value of that alone would have raised the game a point or two with me.  Darn those laws of physics!  Board is 30% to 40% too large for a game like this, and it's definitely pushed me away from buying it as I don't want to have a store a game this big unless I like it very much.

This is so much more than just a box full of lights and mirrors.  There is a real game here, much more than I ever expected.  By the way I was hanging on for dear life from the first move you can tell it was heavily influenced by chess. A great game.  How did Polarity win all those science awards and not Khet.

This would be a good game just as an abstract battle.  But they added lasers.  So it became a great game.  I understand why it has to be clunky, but I do wish it was more mobile.

RATING: 10
One of my favorite games ever. I will need to get Khet 2.0 as I imagine the first few moves in that version won't fall in the habit of being very similar, but I still enjoy this game above all others. It's partially due to the fact that I found it unopened at a friends house and he just let me have it after it was collecting dust for years. It was the surprise game find of my life! Wish there were more games like this.

Edit: I must also say that I strongly disagree with many of the negative ratings I've seen this game get on here. Some of them complain that the lasers aren't always straight. I've played four different copies of this game and I've never had this problem. I also would be the first to say that this isn't everyone's cup of tea; however, to say this game lacks depth or isn't strategic indicates great ignorance (or just plain lack of intelligence and counter-intuitive thinking ability) to the actual game itself. There is an app you can get for IOS devices. Just try playing it on the harder difficulties, and you will see that you are not thinking about the game correctly when the computer promptly kicks you right in the butt.

Not sure what the fuss is about this game. The laser does not even show up very well.  What you are left with is a rather dry 2-player only experience that can end abruptly on one false move.  The game is all tactics with no long term strategy. Chess it isn't.

Rating of 8 based on 5 plays.  So far, this game has not only held but increased my interest.  The laser is not just neat but central to the game.  The pieces, rather than having direct influence, have an influence related to where they reflect (or alternately, block, once) the laser, a refreshing change from other abstracts.

This is possibly my favorite modern abstract. (Although I also really like Cannon) I've played at least 20 games, and it hasn't turned dull.

If you are the sort of person who likes Chess variants, I think you'll like it.  It seems to have all the depth of play of Chess.

I think the overall rating for this game suffers on BoardGameGeek for a somewhat unfair reason.  People see the lasers, and look forward to a fun day of blasting things with laser beams, and instead they find a Chess-like game that requires some very interesting spatial reasoning and a lot of patience.  If you don't like abstract strategy, you won't like this game.

Aside from the amusing and fun mechanism for eliminating pieces (who doesn't love angled mirrors and reflected light?) this game is destined to become one of my favorite 2-player abstracts--if it supported more than two players it would supplant my beloved Ricochet Robot.  I am very much looking forward to experiencing a game that lasts long enough for both beams to come into play--so far all the games I've played have ended rather abrubtly via foolish mistakes (most of them not mine, thankfully) while only one "path" has been contested.  Finding somebody other than my wife to play this with is a top priority....  My previous comment regarding the dead Chinese batteries that came with the game was noticed by the good folks at Deflexion, LLC, who offered free replacements--considering the already stellar quality of gameplay and components, I couldn't bring myself to take them up on that very kind offer.

Love the idea of the game and the strategy involved. The mirrors aren't at the perfect angle and so if the laser bounces more than 3 times it's usually off by quite a bit, sometimes not even hitting a piece anymore, and I wish it was green lasers so you could see the beam. Needless to say I'll be modifying mine.

Freakin' cool. Very simple rules. Chess-based, but with a variety of opening setups. All pieces have basically the same movement, so less studying. And while I always enjoy the game, I don't really take it as seriously as other abstracts - I just react.

We've been trying out the 'Dynasty' setup lately. Like it. 'Classic' would still be best for starting out, but Dynasty is crazy.

This is a heavily strategic game that is very similar to chess in that it mandates single moves and requires slow, thoughtful spatial analysis to play well.  If you like the deep strategic thought of chess, but hate that you have to memorize 500 years' worth of chess research to be able to play chess well, Khet just might be for you (as most people don't know the strategies in Khet).  

I enjoyed Khet greatly, though found that, like chess, it took more than an hour to play a single game.  Also, like chess, I'm a bit concerned that those who research strategic possibilities will perform far better than those who don't.

Very unique presentation to what is essentially an abstract 2-player chessesque game.  What I didn't like about it was the size of the game (makes transport and storage difficult) and the time it takes to set up the game.  After playing this game 10 times, I still had to look at the instruction manual for the location of each piece to get the setup correct.  This got tedious for us. It's a solid game, I'm just not sure how many times it'll come to the table now that the novelty has worn off.

Took it down to a 7.5 because I'm starting to question the replayability... there are only a few legit ways to open. However, I retain my high rating of this game because it has frikkin lasers, ok? It looks great, it's interesting for new and non-gamers, and as filler for a 2-player game night, it's pretty robust.

Interesting.  I owe this game a few more plays, but it seems after a few games that you really have to concentrate on everything both of you are doing because a small maneuver could change quite a lot.  Last game I made a move that ultimately helped my opponent secure the win completely unbeknownst to me.  I guess, being a game where you have to constantly re-assess every single piece after every move, I would just rather play Chess than this.

This is a good abstract strategy game. You have to constantly be aware of where the lasers will be going and where they might be redirected. The rules are simple and the difficulty is in figuring out the strategy. A good game that uses the lasers not just as a gimmick, but really integrates them.

First impression (2 player): It's an abstract strategy game with a gimmick. Full information abstracts are something I don't like too much as they are too demanding. I simply cannot "just play" them. See also my entry for Yinsh if you want to know more about this subject.

The lazer thing ensures I can almost always snare someone into playing. I suspect this may be more limited than I think it is, but for now, this is in high rotation, and it's a fabulous tool for teaching strategy. There's a nice tradeoff between offensive and defensive moves, and it's sweet when you can use the opponent's lazer against them.

RATING: 6
Exceptionally big and sturdy board and bits (original Deflexion; Haven't tried the Khet version). Very nice to handle. The laser gimmick is neat, and lures you into making your own sound effects :P

Anyhow, the gameplay is too chess-like. It's surprising that the BGG forums aren't full of analysis on opening moves and board positions yet. 

And I just can't see the possible moves.

Abstract game with a big gimmick - a real working laser, which is frankly disappointing. Needs to be played in a dark smoke filled room to see the laser, which is otherwise underwhelming. Another reason to play in the dark is to hide the board which is a huge slab of ugly plastic. The laser adds a unique element of game play, which isn't really anything to shout about.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Apart from the obvious gimmick of having a game using lasers (which of course aren't necessary to understand or play the game, but just to highlight the moves and to have the game always being played at home and nowhere else), Khet is a rather unique abstract where players try to annihilate the opponent's main piece by firing a beam from "their right corner of the board" in forward direction and then guiding it with the other pieces, which have built-in mirrors.

There aren't many pieces for each player so that Khet always stays manageable, and the development of different setups is encouraged. Nevertheless, the fact that the laser is only able to fire beams in one direction, so that a piece is always needed in the right column of the board, considerably restricts the still huge choices for different strategies. The action unfolds VERY slowly. This might be an advantage (easier to grasp) or a disadvantage (not as deep as it could be) depending on the player's taste.

Note: this review was written for the first edition of the game, then named Deflexion. Later editions of Khet increment a lot the firing range of the lasers.

It's kind of gimmicky, but there's no denying that the addition of lasers makes the game much cooler than mere checkers. Requires sound effects (provided by the players) for a more immersive experience.

Basically chess with mirrors and lasers. Gave it as a birthday present.

Clever idea. Once you're past the novelty value, it's a standard abstract game of setting up multiple threats that builds more pressure than a single defensive move can eventually cover. You have a standard "move or twist" turn which doesn't generate too much surprise. The game is elevated by the pair of pieces you have that allow you to switch places with something. Suddenly the game gets turned upside down a bit - it's nice surprise factor. As your attack and defense start on different sides of the board, your initial aim is to engineer the most dangerous attack first - which is your best defense as your opponent will be forced to be blocking off your moves. There's a nice satisfaction in finding the move that turns defense into offense, but it felt a bit long with block after block, trying to obtain that final checkmate situation. It's interesting and engaging enough to play occasionally maybe, but not enough to study and replay for me.

RATING: 8
I enjoy this one, as do my sons. I have not had the laser aiming problems that other players have described, but I can certainly see how that would be frustrating. The game can turn on a dime if you're not good at predicting opponent strategies. When I was initially learning it, I accidentally killed my own pharaoh (equivalent to chess's king) twice, and I'm not dumb.
Have not played with the beam-splitter piece.

My son got it for his b-day, and it's pretty fun.  I wish I still smoked, because then you could see the lasers bounce around the board.  Maybe a dry ice machine or something?  :)

Yes, it has lasers.  The most important impact the lasers have is that it gives the game a built-in "no takebacks" rule.  Most of the time the game will end with a blunder, which isn't very satisfying, and makes for long games between brainiacs.

LASERS !!  Now then... how good a game will it be?

Having now played it nearly 20 times I feel confident I can give at least some initial comments. I really like this game. There is a lot of strategic depth possible. I find myself going back after playing a game and looking at different opening strategies and evaluating their value. That's a sign of a good game if you're more than willing to just sit there hashing out different opening strategies. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes abstract games.

It's a real-life version of various Flash games of laser beams and mirrors, with tactical chess-like movement, trying to zap the enemy king.  I liked it more than I expected, but it seemed like a risk of deadlock if both players defend their kings too passively with the double-mirror thingies.  But certainly worth playing for the novelty value in any case.

--Nov2005-- Very cool!  Almost too cool - hard to keep the kids away from it.  I'm not at all sure that the game (and rating) has staying power, but for the moment the geeky fun of watching the laser fire is enough to bring it to the table.  The fact that the 10 year old is completely smitten with it is good, too.
--Jun2006-- Perhaps not as much staying power as one might have hoped.  On the other hand, as a periodic amusement, it's still good.

Love the idea, but wish it were possible to see a laser :(  That would make it much more fun. The game is kind of like chess, but simpler... though somehow some people TOTALLY don't understand the concept and get owned. Some people don't know why the laser doesn't reflect at an angle exactly perpendicular to the mirror face, rather than at the 90 degree angle it does travel... those people ALWAYS lose ;)

It seems like it's going to be either a one-trick pony, or too "chess-y".  It is neither.  Thoroughly enjoyable, and it bears three of the hallmarks I use to identify games that are instant classics:  1 - Simple to learn, 2 - Simple to teach, 3 - Finishes quickly.  A very innovative if unorthodox game and much more rewarding than it seems like it will be.  I was very happy to have tried this.

I bought Deflection and then Khet.  I've been very happy with this game.  Everyone I've shown it to has loved it.  The name laser chess isn't very apt since the pieces all move the same ways, but the idea of using a laser with chess-like strategies is pretty close.  This one is definitely more than a flash in the pan with a cool gimmick (but it does have a cool gimmick).

I'm something of a sucker for two-player strategic games like this.  Adding in the laser just made this one too tempting to pass up.  I ordered a copy of the original Deflexion as soon as I could.  I don't get to play this nearly enough, primarily secondary to the number of games I own but also due to opportunity.  I'm not particularly good, but I believe this would be improved with more play.  As mentioned elsewhere, as this point I would want to play with the beam splitters any time I play.  Also, while I have an extra set of Obelisks (thank guys!), I've not actually played with the newer rules from Khet that would use them.  [01/08/2011]

Interesting concept (note, I didn't say Gimmick). Doesn't seem all that hard to produce what with the flood of cheap 'laser' pointers available on the market.

Happy to see this work. They need to get a better graphic designer though. The current one looks clunky and garish.

UPDATE: Interesting if somewhat chintzily produced abstract. Players are trying to move their pieces (with built in mirrors) in order to eliminate other pieces and eventually the enemy's Sphinx.

The buildup is painfully slow (as all pieces only move 1 space or rotate) and experienced players will have a huge advantage. Often see players taking ages to analyse the laser's path and potential moves. Newbies will make movess that end up killing their own pieces. What fun!

Terrific game. The laser technology is NOT a tacked-on gimmick; the light that bounces around the board offers a new dynamic to an abstract strategy game. Don't be surprised to find yourself tracking the potential "flight path" of the beam with your index finger (Let's see. . it goes here, then here, then here. . ). With only three games of this under my belt, I am literally astounded at the available depth of its potential strategy and tactics. It engages your brain the way a chess game might, though instead of envisioning the movement of pieces in straight lines angling in one direction across a board, you have a light beam moving in a LOT of straight lines angling in all directions (except diagonally). Not to mention the fact that the pieces move (and they do move diagonally) and turn in place, as well. Too soon for a review; don't know enough about basic strategy and tactics to comment, but I'll be at this with enthusiasm for quite a while.

I imagine a world where this game could be built with engineering precision.  With such precision, we could also see new advances such as beam enhancers, color changers, and a much bigger board, with more pieces.  It would cost $2,000 and would probably not be much more fFun than it is right now.

An interesting abstract strategy games that requires a lot of imagination. Not only you have to think about the pieces moving, but also always pay attention to the way the laser is going to go. And you have to plan your strategy really some moves ahead, because when you get into some tight spot, one move won't solve it. The downside is to really get into the game, you have to play often and get used to the mechanics. And it's get lengthy, almost like playing chess. Still an interesting abstract.

On the Deflexion version:
The package design is perfectly amateur, the board and pieces are as clunky as a thick soled shoe, but the game is damned clever. after four plays, i am very intrigued and i hope it remains fascinating with more familiarity. I'm surprised that an independent custom production with a small manufacturing run can be as affordable as this.

The newer production is more efficient, possibly more elegant, same gameplay.

RATING: 6
['Deflexion' 2005 edition] {Abstract, Physics; laser, king-killing} A nice variant to chess-like abstract game. The gimmick of laser is really attractive. An excellent game for college students but experienced gamers may find it not challenging enough. 

Require spatial logical mind. Not the greatest of all in abstract game but it deserves a try.

The bits are excellent! I am wondering the durability of the laser beams. I am also concerned if the new expansion can be compatible to my old copy.

[Khet edition] The new edition is more attractive. The color tune is shaper and there are hieroglyphs on the box edge. New rules, in good sense (sadly, I can't have double obelisks). The board setup changes a little as well - there are four new restricted spaces (2 for each player).

Birthday present Apr 06

This is larger than I thought. Very nice quality. Set up at the beginning of each game needs the instructions until we can remember, not easy for us lol. DS 7yrs thinks this is the best game I got for my birthday, he plays with it on his own fiddling around with the beams. My brain has not quite got it yet but I did manage to win a game.....somehow!?! Dh enjoyed but probably would enjoy more with better players then us. Looking forward to more games.

I played this once and several years ago, from what I remember I had a lot of fun, a very unique game.  I am putting this at a 7 for now but it could easily go up or down.  I need to play a game in more recent times to find out.  Will update again shortly.

Why oh why did they change the color scheme!? Now I can't justify getting the Eye of Horus beam-splitter... This is what I get for being an early-adopter. The game is reminiscent of a video-game I once owned called Laser Chess. I like it solely for this reason.

Great fun. Plays in 10 minutes (at least for now) and gives a very satisfying sense of challenge and involvement for the short playing time. Never a problem getting folks to play. I'm looking at employing dry ice alongside for greater visualization of the playing field.

A nice game, but the aligment problems that occurs when the beam bounces off from six - seven mirrors or more is a real turn-off.

An abstract, Chess-like game made way more fun thanks to the addition of lasers and mirrors! Gameplay is straightforward (though expect to shoot yourself the first few games), the pieces are chunky and nice, and the only downside is the need for batteries and a not-insignificant setup time. If you like light abstracts, get this one.

Coolness, lasers, nor tower expansions can save this game from repetitive, derivative, chess-like gameplay.  Quickly becomes an exercise in tedium, once the idiosyncrasies of the game are discovered.  There's only two points where the lasers shoot from... no matter what spatial arrangements skills you have, this makes the game a one-by-one piece killing affair, and a slow methodically paced one at that.

Culled - First wave; Gifted to Macinda

Why we culled it: Honestly, I hate games that require batteries. Khet is a cool game in theory, and I've enjoyed a few games of it at friends' houses. Laser-mirror-chess is just a neat idea. But it rarely comes out, takes up an unfair amount of space, and managing the batteries in the game just seems like a counterproductive hassle for tabletop gaming. I know that can't avoid coming across as some sort of purist/elitist/traditionalist crap - and it probably is, to some extent. But there we have it.

RATING: 7
I was absolutely and completely atrocious at this game, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.  It's really just a fairly simple chess-like abstract strategy game at it's heart, but the laser makes it a good deal more interesting of course.  It's a two-player game played on a grid where each player has a few different pieces that they move around in different ways, and they're trying to position their mirrored pieces so that the laser bounces to hit their opponent's king.  I can't visualize what the results of my moves will be for the life of me, but it's still fun and could definitely be enjoyed by people who like abstract games.

A really interesting game that is almost like a combination of billiards and chess… you make bank shots every round from a laser on the board off of pieces that you control.  A nice combination of offense and defense pervades the game.

I can slowly feel my mind warping as I look at the board… but it is a good kind of warping :D  Highly recommended due to its unique gameplay and simplicity of rules.  It is also relatively short, which is nice for a game of its type.

Khet is an abstract game along the lines of Chess, where the object is to move pieces around a board to kill the enemy king.  Only each side controls a laser beam and pieces have mirrors.

This is an elegant game, and whether you'll like it or not depends on whether you appreciate abstracts or not.  The laser does add a (very) slight "cool" factor.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
[thing=16991][/thing] is a pretty unique game: because it uses lasers and its refraction in mirrors in order to create its gameplay. The idea is use pieces composed by angled mirrors to lead the beam of laser in order to hit the Pharaoh of the opponent, while, at the same time, preventing this fate to happen with yours. 

Pieces that are hit by the laser in any part that isn't the mirror (expect the Anubis pieces, that don't have mirrors and are only removed if hit on the sides, not in the front, and the Sphinx pieces), are removed, even if the beam comes from the owner of the piece. Normally the pieces have one mirror in a 45º angle, and are opaque on the other side, where they can be hit and eliminated.

The winner will be the person that hits the Pharaoh of the other person with laser.

[thing=16991][/thing] is exactly the type of game that slaps me in face: one of my weakness are games that require spatial awareness, such as Ubongo, and with [thing=16991][/thing] wasn't different, as I suffered dearly trying to cope with the positioning of the pieces close to a minimally efficient way. Usually, since I didn't want to take too long to make a move, I would lost track to where my beam would go, and, worst, what were the options my opponent would have, which windows I should close, and leaving opportunities for they to explore. My first games were ridiculous, almost shameful, but I did got a little better, at least to the point of actually giving some challenge to my adversaries.

And this happened because [thing=16991][/thing] is a game with simple rules: the movement of pieces isn't complicated, and the laser, always refracted in a 45º, allows, with some attention, to calculate where it will go.

[thing=16991][/thing] is definitely a good game to teach and exercise the spatial muscles, demanding forward planning, preparation and responses to the opponent's moves. There is no luck in the game, but, luckly, the learning curve isn't too steep, thus, after a few plays, the overall quality will became more balanced - and this is easier to achieve since games last around 20-30 minutes.

The manual comes with several types of possible set ups for the board, which is good, as I notice that, after a chunk of plays with the same formation, some optimal moves start to arise, making at least the start of the match more repetitive, though the second half is player driven, and even same starts can lead to different conclusions.

[thing=16991][/thing] isn't, normally, the type of game that, in a personal level, pleases me, due to my lack of fine-tuned spatial intelligence and since is 2 players only, yet it is so unique that I'm compelled to know it deeper. I recommend that you at least try it for the novelty.

Fun game! My parents got me this from an uber-geek catalog of some sort for Christmas 2007. I had definitely looked at this before, laser and mirrors, fun! The game itself is much larger than I thought it would be, and the pieces are nice, sturdy and chunky. The first game was fun ... my dad tried to pull a fast one on me, and then didn't notice that I was doing the exact same thing to him on the other side of the board. Ha ha, I win!

A neat abstract game, that gets better with more plays. It's very difficult to tell if you're winning, so you have to check on your pharoah all the time, which is interesting and tense, but can lead to an anticlimatic win when someone wins due to inattention. The rules are very simple (simpler than chess), but it's very strategic.

RATING: 7
Like chess, an abstract game. But, extremely simple rules. Move a piece 1 space orthogonally or diagonally OR rotate a piece 90-degrees. Press the laser button to see if a piece is killed (ie. illuminated by the laser on a non-mirror side of the piece). If so, remove that piece (yours or your opponent's, doesn't matter, if it's hit it dies). First one to shoot the opponent's Pharaoh piece wins. That's it! 

Both players having a laser gives you two beam paths to manipulate and line up shots. A real brain burner.

The beam of light:
(1) saves you from having to trace the path if you don't want to;
(2) settles any dispute over where the beam would otherwise be.
Otherwise, it's not a particularly interesting game. That said, the beam splitter might make it more interesting.

Khet (aka Deflexion) is a chess-like board game that has two built in lasers and movable Egyptian-themed game pieces that have embedded mirrors which can be positioned to bounce the laser light around the board and hit opponent pieces.
\13\\13\
To play, players alternate moving their pieces around the board. Some pieces have mirrors and some do not. Bounding the board is a raised frame into which are built two low-power lasers, one for each player. The game pieces include a "pharaoh", obelisks, and pyramids with mirrors. After each move, a player must press the button on his/her laser. The beam bounces from mirror to mirror around the playing field. The challenge is to protect one's own pharaoh while maneuvering to "light up" the opposing player's pharaoh.

A science fair project with rules, but I can't blame the designers for following their geeky dream.  Everyone knows that lasers are conspicuous attention-getters, and my attention can be manipulated just as easily as everyone else's.

It's still unrelentingly abstract, so that's that.  It'll never score lower than a six, but it'll never score higher either.

I started this at 6, but have upped it to 8. Although I have a losing record, I really enjoy this a fun and great looking abstract game! The game is quite strategic, and you must balance your offense and defense or you're likely to make mistakes that will cost you the game. Can't wait to play some more. It should be noted though that the European version's laser is quite weak, and a few of my Pyramid pieces are not properly aligned, so the laser bounces wildly, but I've found gameplay satisfying regardless.

Another couple of plays and I found that it has standard openings, and is easily solved.

I was really excited to play this.  I mean come on, LASERS!!  

In practice the lasers are too dim and they get off track too easily, sometimes shooting across the room.  It's a neat idea though.  If they work out the kinks I think it'll be an above-average abstract.

RATING: 7
2007-06-16:  I am amazed by how different this is from Laser Battle.  Movement is very slow, deliberate, and calculated in Khet, since you either rotate a piece 90° or move it 1 space, and then MUST fire your laser - very possibly killing your own unit or pharaoh.  This gives it an intense feel, like chess crossed with 8-ball:  "DOH!  I was so fixated on this move over here that I didn't notice I was giving you a clean shot on my pharaoh!" or "DOH!  I lost the game by shooting my own pharaoh!"  All in all, I like it, and feel that it provides a very different experience from Laser Battle.  The various starting configurations increase the replay value over traditional chesses (except Sittuyin, in which setup is part of the game), especially since they encourage experienced players to invent their own starting setups.

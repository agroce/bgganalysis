This game is full of nice plastic bits.  I wish I still had my old copy to scavenge the pieces for use in my own homemade games.  The game itself?  The character powers are unbalanced, it has a clever system of planet movement (the planets orbit the Sun, and move every turn), combat is similar to Axis & Allies although slower.

Compelling theme, reasonably attractive components, fair rules. I enjoy the early rounds of play but I also think it should conclude sooner than it typically does. Needs a time-limit or other mechanic to encourage aggressive play.

Interesting game based on a classic tv show. Much like other combat games, but the rotating solar system makes it different then others. Usually fun and challenging.

RATING: 6
This game has a very satisfying plethora of bits to play with, complete with white and red discs to use as counters for one and five of a troop type if you end up with too many figures to keep in a single sector. That's a real possibility if you turtle, believe me.

Unfortunately, the game board is prone to wear along the two seams a third of the way in from the left and right hand ends, and the cards are printed in such a way that after a few shuffles, the images start flaking off.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
The planetary movement mechanic is the only thing that really makes this risk-type game stand out. Unfortunately, it is also the mechanic that encourages "cocooning" among players. Everybody takes over a planet, then spends a dozen turns just building up their defenses. Factories are the engine of production and successful players build lots of them. 

I would experiment with a house rule that encourages aggression. Maybe rule that each planet can only have one factory. Or that you can only have one factory for each 5 territories that you hold. This game needs a good house rule, because the board and pieces are great. 

Another idea: alternate the movement direction of the different planets. That could be cool.

RATING: 6
Nice bits, planet movement system is good but Advanced game powers aren't balanced, and my playgroup never wants to play :( Otherwise it would get a higher rating.

RATING: 7
I wanted to like this more than I actually did the few times we played.  The rotation of planets is a womderful idea and there are lots of other nice touches which make this much like 'Axis & Allies in outer space' (you will know if you like that sort of thing).  For me, it was spolied by the overwhelming special power allocated to Buck Rodgers - the other special powers are interesting too but pale into insignificance when it come to combat value. The Alan Moon variant is worth trying.

RATING: 8
Played the crap out of this when I was younger.  The hero special powers are way unbalanced, but that didn't matter when I was growing up, but may change how I play it now with a group of friends.  Good war game that is a heck of a lot more fun than Risk (which I do enjoy).

RATING: 6
March 2016: OK, so I bought some replacement fighters and killer satellites, and some 15mm figures to replace the troopers for the 6th faction, as they were down to 7/20 from 28 years of ownership.

We played a game using the 2.0 rules.  It's fun, but you can feel the age of it.  I doubt I'll play it more than once every couple of years.

Now if only I'd kept my copy of BattleTech The Succession Wars :(  That was a great light wargame.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I liked the mechanism for movement between planets and asteroids. Otherwise the game is pretty similar to Allies & Axis. It is quite possible to be eliminated early in the game. Battles can take a while and the factories hardly produce anything, particularly if you try to relocate a newly-built factory to another planet. Ardala's special ability is totally overpowered. If fewer than six playing, make sure to remove her leader card.

I was lucky enough to pick up a brand new unopened copy of this recently at my local games shop (March 2004)at a bargain price. Forget the "Buck Rogers" name - this is simply a very good low/medium-complexity space strategy game with oodles of great pieces. Best played without using character's special abilities though,which lead to dire unbalancing imo. I'd describe this as a cross between Risk and Axis and Allies. Can be a long game, but great fun and looks wonderful fully set up. Well worth picking up for your collection. Rating based on only 4 playings - could go up with more.

I remember playting this at GenCon when it was brand new. God that makes me feel old. A friend just re-introduced to me to it and it is decent. Essentailly, the designer tinkered with "Axis & Allies" and threw it in a space setting. Unit types are nearly identical to A&A, economics were simplified, and the dynamic geography of "moving the planets" each turn prevents the typical tactical situations found in attrition games. You assemble a battle group and send it on its way. Less player grudges evolve this way, too. It also ends after 8 turns, which is a plus compared to the endless games of Risk and A&A.

The orbiting planets and non-linear movement make this game shine.  The rotating turn order and direction really causes some tense moments. Fleets and Killer Sat's are very important...good times.

Interesting movement mechanic.Spatial position is referenced by a separate map inset that is moving in real time to simulate planetary movement. This allows either fast or slow interplanetary movement depending on orbital position. Great for surprise invasions, especially if someone is caught sleeping and not paying attention to orbital position.
Huge game board!

Amazing piece of Ameritrash history here. This game pretends to be a GameMaster series game, and yet it plays in half the time by removing a lot of unnecessary complexities. It's comparable, almost deceptive simplicity, however, does not make this any less a brilliant strategic endeavor than Axis & Allies; lo, I will play Buck Rogers before A&A for its faster and more flexible play any day.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This is a fun cross between Axis & Allies and Risk, with a space theme. It's a really good game, for it's age and is pretty simple to learn, once you get started playing. I really like the random setup of players and the way the planets and asteroids rotate around each other. It's a really nice mechanic.

Players are trying to build up their forces and spread out throughout the universe to settle new territories. There are 2 different types of troops and 3 types of space ships, along with killer satellites and production facilities, to produce more of everything.

As the game goes on and forces start to build up, there will be conflict among the players. Space battles and ground troops start duking it out across the universe, to try and claim the territories and those precious production facilities from their opponents.

The components are top notch and look great. Tons of varying types of mini figures, a huge game board, that looks great, plus your usual assortment of game cards and counters. There's even a bunch of styrofoam dividers, for each player to keep their game pieces sorted in.

This turned out to be a great game, that I'm glad I finally got into my collection. I'd definitely recommend this one for a mid-weight game. It even supports up to 6 players, though the game length and down time will of course lengthen a bit. There's even a basic and advanced version to play, with lots of optional rules, that you can add if you like. Check it out. It's a lot of fun. Especially when you make a peace treaty with one of the players, in hopes to take out another player, with a lot of forces and territories and then you turn around and bomb his planet. LOL!!! So much for that peace treaty. :devil:

This is a great game with a silly theme. It has been called Axis in Allies in space. I like the random setup, diplomacy aspects and the optional rules (particulariy slingshotting your ships around celestial bodies to get extra movement).

This was far and beyond one of the best hobby boardgames of the 80s, and influenced "Ameritrash" games like Twilight Imperium. People who never saw the show might not care about it, but it's fun to relive that campy world. And for its time, it was remarkably well designed. Strange that they chose pastels for all the ship pieces.

Interesting for a mainstream board game of its time, Buck Rogers comes with an easy casual rulebook and an "advanced" rulebook that will satisfy the hobbyist.

Finicky at times, but actually a decent little wargame - orbiting planets lends a very unique feel - the battle zones have variable relative distances to one another. A bit of a chore to set up and runs a little long, but better than most of the other TSR and MB wargame-lite offerings.

This is a typical galactic conquest game. It shares the same issues most games in this genre suffer from ... takes forever to play, long downtime, turtling and player elimination. I'll never forget the game when my old nemesis went to the far reaches of the asteroid belt to wipe out my last remaining outpost to eradicate me completely from the game. Argh!

Got this as a kid. Forgot I had it until my father pulled it out of storage.

Another soft spot from my youth.

It was so hard to find players in the early 90ties Greece pre-internet as a 12 year old boy, that I must have played this game more than 50-60 times solo. And loved every minute of it.

Nowadays a lot of design decisions would not be considered up to snuff, as average game quality has gone through the roof. You know what, I don't care. I'll play this any time of the week. I just love it.

A good space-simulation game. I like the rotation of the planets, but the downside is that the games often end in killer satellites bogging down the game and players being isolated to each of their own planets. Played it about 10 times with different players, and this is always the result. the one who can sneak enough asteroids wins... which is kind of a drag.

This appears kiddish and indeed is great for kids. But it also has a great movement mechanic in having the planets (and therefore target destinations and home bases) orbiting constantly.

In the Risk family, with many bells and whistles, and some amazing bits.  Also of note is the cool solar system-orbit interplanetary movement, which allows for devastating sneak attacks. 
 Once people take over entire planets and fortify, the game can bog down as it can be very costly to take out a killer satellite.  
 This is a rare case where I prefer the basic game to the advanced, which to me adds many elements of questionable value.

Beatiful components, horribly flawed game. The character&#039;s powers are totally unbalanced, and the game structure encourages players to build up massive fleets of fighters.

Love this game! Bought this in 1988 as soon as it was released and has remained my favorite game of all time. Based on a reboot of the Buck Rogers property in 1988 which included about 9 novels a handful of comic books and a failed role-playing game developed by TSR as well. I read about 6 of the novels,  loved them as well. A lot of people here compare to Risk, other than conquering territorys it's a completely different game. There are some similarities to Axis & Allies in game play but, make no mistake this is no team game. I can't play this game with out thinking of the T.V. show The Expanse. A lot of similar ideas The Expanse has, the Buck Rogers series had as well.  Mars and Earth on the Brink of war, Belters struggling for independence. The idea of terraforming planets. Would not be surprised at all if one of the Authors played this game back in the day!

RATING: 5
Buck Rogers meets Axis & Allies.  A very cool looking game with some great ideas (especially the novelty of the moving solar system track that brings planets closer to and farther from each other at the most inopportune times).  

But it wasn't balanced as well as it could have been, especially regarding the leaders' special powers in the Advanced Rules, and so many matches seemed to turn into an arms race where you just pile up more and more and more Fighters, Gennies, and whatever else until you finally hope you have enough to win the inevitable war of attrition when you finally go after someone's planet or they go after yours.  It definitely had its moments, but the rules needed a bit of an overhaul.

Hence I think I'm gonna give the 2.0 rules set here on the 'Geek a try and see how it goes.  Afterward I may revise my rating again.

Wow. Just the game board topology alone would make this an interesting game; it takes into account the relative motion of the planets but without maths. It plays at the level of complexity of the Gaemmaster series games [the original A&A or CotE, Shogun/Samurai Swords] which I like as well.

A lost gem, in my opinion. Build up your space forces to scoop up and fight for territory on and around the planets of the "inner" solar system. Similer to Risk I suppose, although the combat system is more in common with Axis and Allies, with movement followed by attacking and then factory production to replace your losses. In a great twist, the plants rotate around the sun each turn, with Mars always seeming out of the way. The game includes a Basic version, but also throws in an extra rulebook that contains both an advanced game that fills in the blanks, plus even more "optional" rules. It's great to make a mix-and-match version, although part of me has a hard time deciding on which rule set is "official." Getting your forces from one planet to another isn't as fussy and hard as A&A, but it still takes a bit too long unless you have a convoy of transports, and the time limit is needed, otherwise every game would end up the same, with each planet's main controller just sitting put and bulking up forces. Worth a look!

Haven't even played the full advanced rules completely yet and it is already incredibly fun. The orbit map is very well done.  Having to plan out where you can make it as planets orbit is great, its even better when you get to point out to someone that isn't paying attention they aren't going to be able to get where they want. Makes for some great tense games.

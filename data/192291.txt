GAME: Sushi Go Party!
RANK: 146
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I should rank this higher, as this is one of my "go to" games to introduce new players into the hobby. The lower value is essentially due to the effect of "hate drafting" that can occur in the game. That of course can be mitigated with different layouts, which is great, but I find one or two skilled players will run the table with inexperienced players.

Basically Sushi Go, but better. Almost all of the cards (I'm looking at you, Spoon) work REALLY well, and most menus, if put together with some thought, blend well together - its difficult to put together a complete disaster menu, because of how it's all so well thought out.

The board is also lovely and well made.

[I]tl;dr Sushi Go Party is a great remix of the original, offering more replayability with more card powers, variable recipes. This is a great card-drafting game that is perfect to introduce to non-gamers who may not be comfortable with something more complicated.[/I]

Sushi Go Party! is a remix of the original Sushi Go, which is fun, fast-paced card-drafting game. Basically, each player starts the game with a hand, which they must pick one card from, and then pass the hand to the player on their left. Picked cards go face-up in front of you to form your draft, which will be scored at the end of the round for points. You keep passing hands until every card is on the table. 

To top it off, the game is illustrated with adorable Japanese art -- cute faces on sushi rolls and tempura is the best! Sushi Go Party expands the original game by adding several new types of food, which you will shuffle in depending on which 'menu' you pick before the game-- different menus feature different foods and are easier/more difficult to score. 

I like the Party! edition because the game comes with 8 different menus you can try, including the original Sushi Go. With enough practice, you could probably get pretty good at crafting your own menus to go in the game. Because there are different cards to include in different menus, you can tune the game to be cutthroat or forgiving, cooperative or competitive, high-scoring or low-scoring. It's exactly the sort of 'expansion' that Sushi Go! needed because the core mechanic stays exactly the same, but you have more options with all the new foods. 

With continued plays, this game has become my go-to for introducing new people to the hobby. It's simple to explain, a great entry point to something like 7 Wonders, and the cute artwork never fails to draw people in. The flexible player count (8 players, how many games can you say that for??) means that this is an all-around gem in my collection that I will never get rid of.

RATING: 6
A fun, light social game. The variability makes the rules a bit more difficult to grasp but everyone seems to enjoy themselves after getting the hang of it. I like that there's a lot of choice as to what to play - this increases the replayability of the game. 

The biggest con for me is probably the insert - the card are a VERY tight fit when placed straight and I had to place them diagonally in order to get all the cards to fit. The way the insert and box is structured also makes it very difficult to see which card is which, and you cannot place the menu tiles vertically (or it will be squashed by the board above). 

Edit: after a few more plays, this didn't hit the spot for most of my non-gamer friends. Will adjust my rating as such.

(+) Plays fast regardless of player count (simultaneous actions), variable setup with menu tiles, simple scoring, easy to pick up for new players, adorable artwork

(-) 7 Wonders does everything this does better (other than being more approachable for new players), low player interaction for a group game, kind of long to set up for something so light, tin box

The game fits its title properly. It's a perfect game to play in parties and gatherings.
You can create your own menu and that determines the dynamic and feeling that the game will have. From light experiences like "My first meal" to fierce competitions using tofus, eels, fruits, etc.
The best part is that the game's thematic and dynamics are so simple that everyone can play and enojoy it, even kids.

1st play - First play and the game is definitely an improvement over original Sushi Go.  It's similar to the basic game, but with variety and added replayability.  Drafting isn't my favorite mechanic, but this one makes it very pure and very painless.  The art is excellent and family friendly.

This is even BETTER than the original Sushi Go! The variety that allows every game to be different is really an improvement. The scoretrack is great by giving a visual scoring and the cards in the center help to tell everyone what cards are in play. No reason to own both, no reason to start with the regular. Just get Sushi Go Party from the start. Great for families and also a great medium/light gateway game.

:arrowE: [u]Synopsis[/u]:
I generally prefer heavier games, but Sushi Go Party! is drafting in its most perfected distillation. To quote [person=50716][/person],

[q="lee elektrik"]It's Seven Wonders, only without all the annoying shit.[/q]
Pick a card, pass your hand. Rinse. Repeat. Play three hands. Game over.

:arrowE: [u]What I like most[/u]:
The scoring rubric for the original Sushi Go! was already tight and well-balanced, but adding so many new types of cards has not eroded that balance in the slightest. Each game is filled with excellent interactions and a mini-meta is developed between the players every time. Whether playing with big-points cards or very tight, stabby scoring, every game is close! Each game is quick, but the crunch of trying to cram as much successful scoring into each hand is excellent. Add to that the options of brute-forcing points without desserts (what I normally do) or scoring massive end-game points with desserts, all while competing with collaborative cards like Miso, Edamame, Chopsticks, and Spoon... ah, so much goodness. Such a tight design. It's sheer beauty in simplicity.

:arrowE: [u]What I like least[/u]:
The hate drafting can, at times, reach an outlandish pitch and wreck a single hand. It's tough to be on the receiving end of it three hands in a row.

Lots of options for setup. Better deck size compared to the original. That said, this game seems really erratic at times score wise.  Push your luck Could use with a house rule to add 1 card to hand size and choose 1 discard one on last pass each round. Card quality isn't great. This is a good light family weight drafting game but if you have played heavier drafting games and not with your family, this one is left in the dust.

Everything of the original with additional variety.  I have seen that a few of the new offerings (i.e. Soy Sauce and Edamame) are a little quirky for non-gamers to wrap their brain around.  But, I've put together a pretty basic deck that goes beyond the non-party variety that plays quick and pretty much everyone likes.

This is a great game! It's a good filler for in between those longer games. The best part is that kids can join in on the fun. My 5 year old loves it and the mechanics are easy for her to understand. She does need help with tallying up the points at the end of the round though.

The game's tin is pretty bad.  The lid comes off easily in a backpack.  The pawns fall out of their slot in the insert when the box is upright.  Also, I hate trying to sleeve bridge-sized cards.

That said, I just found out that my sleeved cards (I'm using Mayday's 2-cent bridge sleeves) indeed fit back in the insert.  The game is a lot easier to store when using the insert as-designed.

I love the board!  The tiles in the center are really helpful reference, and the score track is a lot more convenient than keeping score with paper.

A fantastic way to blow out the base game with a lot more variation to the drafting, thanks to a fat pile of new cards; the scoreboard is super useful and you can now customize each game with different course tiles. Sushi Go gets an increased lease on life, although I wish the original could have been incorporated better. Irasshaimase!

Overall, I like the production quality and the ability to mix different cards/abilities together. But, this is still sushi go... a game that I find to have shallow decisions and a huge luck factor. Certainly, there is a market for this type of game. And for those looking for a gateway game and/or something to play with kids... this may be a very strong title. But personally, it's not for me.

Initial Impression: What a great, simple game. The artwork received a solid thumbs up from the kids. The short playtime and theme made my wife happy. The interaction was what sold this game for me. The gameplay is so simple. Pick a card from your hand, place it facedown on the table. Reveal the cards simultaneously. Pass the cards to the player beside you. Scoring is super simple as well, which allows everyone to concentrate on which sets and cards to focus on. Although the game can be played with many people, I think I would prefer the four player count. It allows you to constantly watch what everyone is choosing while at the same time adds just enough chaos into the mix. The kids are looking forward to more sessions of this game.

This game is a big hit with large groups!  Its light and easy but has some fun choices.  I have brought this into non-gaming groups, and it's always been a hit.  The art is so adorable and it adds so much character to the game.  If the game wasn't as colorful, I guarantee you it wouldn't be nearly as fun (for me and my groups, at least).  I image trying to play a dark-themed version of this and just hating it.  But the playful, colorful art is perfect for the game.  Sushi Go Party is great because it adds so much variety to it as well!

Very fun and light group game that requires a bit of strategy. Expanded version of original Sushi Go! that utilizes different card types. Personally I love this version and would choose it over the smaller base version for extra cards and the included game board. Difficulty is low and makes for a quick, fun group game for a variety of ages! Recommended Players: 4-6.

Another game that is great with a wide spectrum of people. We end up pulling Codenames out more than this. I would also rather play Mysterium than this, but I expect Sushi Go is a game we will end up playing more than Mysterium if only for its ease of travel and various game "menus." 

Edit: April 2017: It'll get played sporadically if we want something simple, but there are better games if we want a lower complexity game (e.g., Junk Art) or short play time (e.g., Mr. Jack)

No question, Party Version is the way to go!

Great game to introduce people to the concept of drafting.
A lot of my mtg friends are a fan. Allows the fun of drafting without spending 5 hours building decks and playing games as well. A lot less of a time commitment.

Although this game is versatile, allowing many players, I would choose the sets carefully, based on number of players. I have often found certain sets allow for high level of strategy, bluffing and reading people at low numbers, but became a guessing game and dull in high numbers. If you had a good set, record the number of players and the cards so you can bring it up next time.

My biggest regret with this game was not sleeving the cards, they are getting pretty worn.

I have only played Sushi Go a handful of times with my family, but it was a fun fast game. The addition of the game board, and various menu options give it much more flexibility than the base game.
The main down side is that it takes a bit longer to set up, and take down each game. Even so, I consider this a minor issue. It is a small price to pay for more ways to play in one small package.

The closest way I have to describe it is Sushi Go Mario Party. Loved the original and this adds more cards and variety. High replay value.

12/6/16 Update: I had to go back and update my score because these cards are pretty cheap. They started to smear and get cruddy after only 3 plays. For a card drafting game that is absolutely unacceptable! The tin box and insert is cool but it doesn't fit everything correctly and worst of all you can not sleeve your cards because they won't fit in the insert afterwards.

Fantastic party game that everyone in my family loves! My wife is not a gamer in any sense, and even she enjoys playing this one. It is simple, fun, and quick and it also has a great theme. We really do love playing this with just about any group of people. Highly, highly recommended!

The only thing keeping this gem from being a 10 is the insert. I won't repeat what a simple google search will do for you (go look up the community response if you want), but I will say I agree with the criticisms. Terrible insert, otherwise fantastic experience!

This stand alone allows for more players, and gives a large variety of setup options for the popular sushi go. While sushi go is a great game, this adds everything it was missing, without bloating it or changing the core mechanics. There are now various entrees, apps, and deserts to pick from for different scoring options, but the game is still played with exactly the same drafting mechanic.

It also adds a nifty score tracker, which also slots in tiles that show which foods you are playing with each game.

Ant: As someone who learned to draft with Magic: the Gathering, this isn't challenging or tricky enough to really hold me. Cute, and entry level gold, but not exciting for me.

Lustiges Spiel - für Gelegenheitsspieler absolut geeignet (Regeln in 10 min erklärt). Der Card Drafting Mechanismus funktioniert gut und durch die verschiedenen Startkarten-Sets gibt es auch ein wenig Abwechslung. Insgesamt ein unterhaltsamer Spielspaß, allerdings nicht mit allzu viel Spieltiefe. Das Thema ist zwar auf den Karten allgegenwärtig, allerdings ist das Spiel selbst ziemlich abstrakt. Aber: es funktioniert und hat uns bislang Spaß gemacht.

RATING: 6
Played once with 3 players. Very light filler which basically is no more than cut-and-dry drafting and set collection played over three rounds. It's the cutesy art that saves it because gameplay wise there's not much appeal. Lack of replayability is mitigated by selecting certain combination of cards at startup, but don't expect it to be fun for consecutive plays.

Too light for my usual crowd I'm affraid.

A light and simple card drafting filler where each card is simply another way to score points. I really enjoyed my play more than I thought and would happily play this again as it's quick fun and leads to some nice table talk at the end of the round when looking for who has the most and least of certain cards. I'd like to try this again with a different variety of cards just to see how different it actually plays.

If you don't already have Sushi Go!, this is definitely the version to get, as it includes a bunch of new cards and can have up to 8 players, vs 5 in the original. It also includes a board and player tokens, which is useful for keeping score. My only real gripe with this game, is for the packaging. The insert, while nice, only fits the cards themselves, not the tiles, so I'm left to try and cram the rest of the items into the box.

I can't think of a better first game to introduce to a non-gamer. As opposed to other gateway games, Sushi Go has one simple mechanism that shines because of the lack of complexity.

Much more enjoyable and varied than Sushi Go. Some cards feel a bit underwhelming (Green Tea Icecream) and others a bit too overwhelming (Tea), and  few that are very swingy and not to my liking (Spoon, especially), but with the sheer number of cards, I can always come up with a menu to my liking.

That's it? After all the excitement, I expected something more. This is basically a drafting game, where there's nothing else. You draft, and then score. Do it 3 times, and the game's over. And there's not enough drafting to allow for interesting interplay, like 7 Wonders. Nor are they any other decisions, like Seasons. Draft. Score. Done. Well, that's not quite true, there are some "ha ha" cards that in practice are quite confusing to execute, but allow players to do things like make requests of other players, which must be fulfilled if possible. Overall very bland. I think they forgot to put the "Party!" in.

Love the new variety, new cards, and new combinations. Sushi Go was one of the most successful gateway games we had, so it is great to have more variety with the bigger set, and the 2-player "menu" even works pretty well.

A not entirely unpleasant simplification of 7 Wonders which I've always felt to be somewhat overburdened for what you could achieve given a card draft almost beyond your control. This title strikes a much better balance, albeit at the cost of some of the variability of the game's spiritual successor. Of course there will plenty of comments which Stay True To A Fault to 7 Wonders... Different strokes, I suppose.

I've now played the original Sushi Go quite a bit, and it's a fun diversion, but admittedly can get a little old, especially with lower player counts. So when our friend picked this up on sale and asked me to teach it, I jumped at the chance to see what was new.

And this is what you'd probably expect - more new cards, leading to more options and more possible strategies. You'll just need to follow the guide on the mat which shows you what the maximum is on card types to include. Fair warning: Wasabi is dealt with separately from Nigiri, which I didn't expect so we messed that up in our first game.

So this is a good new option, but players who already have the original will probably just want to sell/trade/give away their old copy before picking it up.

Hmm what to say, seemingly fixes everything - though I didn't have a problem at all -  you could dislike about the original: you have a board so no bits of paper for adding up scores, very increased variety, higher player count, a set up in the rules that works for two, and works quite well indeed. 

This is my go to drafting game. And perhaps the only one I need. 

Though saying all that I had no issue with original, and now it is obsolete as you get all of it in in this tin (gah! Tin!), which sort of makes me sad, but not that sad as this is awesome.

Only issue I have is that I don't like the insert as I am not going to store the board onto of the cards and the tin is a bit annoying.

I give this game an 8, like Sushi Go, but I hate Spoon.  This card makes you play the game differently, namely slower and more convoluted.  Other than that one card, this is a home run.  It's got everything the great original has, with more options and more everything.  Just don't play with Spoon.

This is exactly what I was looking for as an expansion to Sushi Go. A bit unfortunate it had to come as its own separate game, but regardless being able to pick and choose which cards to play with game by game is a great feature and will extend the life of this game by miles. Will need to see how playing with more than 4 feels.

The added deck building choices are a welcome addition to the game (including the hard to find Soy Sauce). The scoreboard / reference board are a fine addition to the game, though they are ugly and are the cause for the tin box being about 3 times larger than the original, which kinda sucks.

If you rarely play Sushi Go!, stick with the more portable original, it is packed with all the fun you need.

If you play the fishy nuts out of the game, get Sushi Go! party as you will want the variety for little extra cost to buy.

I love that Sushi Go gets more variety with this, but it comes at a (slight) cost of increasing setup and teardown time. Seems like the cards in this are not as high quality as the cards in regular Sushi Go. Still, the scoreboard is cool, the increased player count is great, and overall this is a better package. I may still hang on to Sushi Go for introducing it to new gamers, though.

A really great & simple game. I bought this as a gateway game to introduce new gamers into modern games. I own 7 Wonders, which is a decent game but believe that it fails as a gateway game, as well as a more complex "gamers game" to some degree. I think Sushi Go fills the basic hand drafting niche better. Easy to explain and quick to play, with a cute factor that gets people interested.

I'm a little conflicted on how much I like this. Part of the fun of the original was the emergent interaction that showed itself after the players understood the cards. So far, every play of this version has seen players mostly focused on themselves rather than each other as they learn the new cards. I could see this becoming really fun, though, if it gets more interactive again when the players know all the cards and yet not repetitive because a new set can always be tried.

Art is adorable. Gameplay is simple but varied due to quantity of cards available. Simple rules and easy to teach and learn. 

Only complaints are not much table talk; everyone picks a card and plays it simultaneously and only speaks to ask if anyone else played a Miso Soup card at the same time they did, though that could just be my group! Seems quiet for a game with "party!" in the title. Encourages players to carry on unrelated conversations while playing, which could be a plus. Card quality could use some improvement, but it was only a $20 game so oh well. 

Best part of Sushi Go Party! is playing with up to 8 players simultaneously and easily. Fitting a big group like that is amazing!

I love the multitude of new cards which means every play will be different. So far I have tried one of the 'set menus' and found the set up to be a good introduction to some of the new mechanics and I have also randomly shuffled new cards together, which was an fun mish-mash of mechanics :D

I am not sure what I think of the new pudding mechanic (i.e. only a set number shuffled in a certain points) as this allows you to card count and determine exactly how much pudding will give you an edge.

I love the new style artwork and everything is so happy, however getting everything back into the tin after is a bit tight. You cannot sleeve the cards as they will no longer fit and the divider cards have to be laid on their side (thus not doing the function there were designed for) otherwise the board will not fit back into the tin, bit of a shame, but I suppose I could remove the insert and baggie everything

I actually prefer the basic game, as whilst this gives you many more options, it takes time to setup. This is better as a game you just grab then deal out as you explain the rules (Rating 7.335, Jan 17) UPDATE: Played with 7-8 people, and its not that fun.  Again, too fiddly with the setup, and the box insert it terrible.  Chuck it out and put your cards in baggies.  Definitely a fan of just the base game without these frills (Rating 6.652 Feb 18).

I like Sushi Go and this gives the game more longevity by adding a variety of choices. A minor downside is the increased setup and takedown of the game because you have to separate and shuffle the different cards each time you play.

My biggest gripe comes with the White Goblin Games box. This box is terrible, worse then the standard tin box. It's big, filled with mostly air and because it lacks an insert the components will shuffle around if you move it. I got this game as a gift but I would have hunted down an international copy if I knew the box would have been this terrible.

Like Sushi Go? Here's another serving! Party bumps up the player count to 8, includes lots of creative new cards that you can mix and match to form different "menus", increasing replayability. Also included is a scoring track, so you don't need to write those down. The only downside is this makes it less portable.

I mean, I loved Sushi Go at first too. It remains to be seen whether I'll burn out on this just as fast.

THAT SAID, playing with 6+ people is much more fun than I would have guessed from the bad experience of playing original Sushi Go with 5. When each hand barely goes around the table once, you have to play the other players and pay close attention to draft order-- fun stuff that's a little present in the tactical 2-3 player game but different in a crowd.

Update [July 2017]: Yeah, I don't really care about the new card effects, but playing in a big group is neat.

This is to Sushi Go what G54 is to Coup. Takes away some of the speed and easy access for a lot more depth and replayability. This is the kind of change I've been wanting in these games after having played them for a few years.

I love Sushi go, and this is more of the same, which I love, a nice new version, more dishes, and a scoretrack! oow yeah.

But... the White goblins version is pretty much crap, the board doesn't has inlaid tiles, but cards that glide away. The pawns are wooden instead of the nice soja bottle saus shaped ones from the US version. The box doesn't fit the cards when laid flat on their flanks, and also doesn't feature an insert... for a game with sets of cards like a  deckbuilder.. I expected a Legendary like insert..

so overal though I love the revamp and the new additions, I really expected a version more like the US tin boxes but WGG didn't bother for EU.

Not unlike 7 Wonders, Sushi Go allows players to construct themselves wonderful Japanese meals, earning victory points for each combination of cards.

Each player starts with a hand of cards, takes one card from the hand on his turn and passes the hand over to the next player.  All players flip the selected cards over simultaneously before the next turn.  Repeat until cards are exhausted, deal two more hands, winner is determined at the end of the game.

Unlike Sushi Go, Sushi Go Party contains a number of different types of card (like Dominion) so that each game can be unique.  Each card type scores slightly differently or has different effects keeping the game fresh.  There's also a board, up to eight playing tokens and is easy on the wallet.  Well worth a purchase.

I do feel like this game is a bit overated. I love the cute artwork. I did not love the quality of my cards! Some of them are different size, so when I stack the cards together, there's one or two cards sticking out and its giving me ocd! Got it as a present so didn't end up returning it for another one. People compare this to 7 wonders a lot. It is similar but different. I would own both of it. Sushi Go is much lighter and easier to teach people and is great for parties, where as 7 wonders you would need the right group of people.

So far, I have been pleasantly surprised by how well this game compares to 7 Wonders. Certainly not as big or complex as its older brother, but Sushi Go manages to pack a lot of depth into a very quick time frame. I love drafting games. And this one is impressive for it's filler-length quality while maintaining much of the fun of more complex and deeper drafting experiences. 

Those comments for Sushi Go above also apply to Sushi Go Party. In fact, all of Sushi Go is contained in this game. But there is so much more. So many new cards and ways to play, it will take several games just to try them all. I can't see ever going back to the original. Sure, not all the cards are as balanced as the first iteration (Miso Soup and Fruit are especially egregious), but you can always skip the ones you don't like or just accept a more casual experience. Ultimately, more of a good game can only be a good thing.

Probably the most 'bang for the buck' of any game I own outside of Love Letter, and much more of a 'game'. Went like blockbusters with every group I ever played it with - family, friends, non-gamers. If you're looking for that 'general purpose' filler, this is my no.1 recommendation.
(Score is based on what I wanted out of the game and what I got from it - which is even slightly more than I hoped for).

Simple: if you haven't bought Sushi Go yet, buy this one instead.
Cool game, with the same recipe as Sushi Go but with a bigger menu. The instructions suggest some menus that goes from the other version to more aggresive play. I like the metalic box, the only thing I didn't like was the concept art in box includes a rabbit roll that was excluded of the game and at the end it was released by error, I think.

------

Sencillamente: si aún no has comprado Sushi Go, compra este en su lugar.
Excelente juego, con la misma receta de Sushi Go pero con un menú más grande. Las instrucciones sugieren algunos menús que van del disponible en la versión anterior a jugadas más agresivas. Me gustó la caja metálica, el único detalle en contra que le veo es que el diseño de la caja incluye un rollo con forma de conejo, el cual no viene incluido en el juego y yo creo, que por error, lo dejaron en el diseño.

I played this with adults and kids ages 8 and everyone picked up the game and had lots of fun. Even the kids. It is a unique concept of passing hands and everyone has an equal chance of getting good cards. This version is leaps and bounds better then just regular sushi go because of the number of cards, game board, and mix and match tiles. It allows for different plays and increases replayability unlike the original.

The game is very cute and new cards adds more variability to the game. Score board is great because you don't need a separate pad to track scores.

Main downside is because you are reshuffling ALL cards between rounds, does cause the game to take a little bit longer than regular Sushi Go. However it isn't too bad.

December 2016 update: I'm copy-pasting my comments on the original below (since I've given it away now), and bumping my score up. [b]Sushi Go! Party[/b] is just fantastic. Yes, I love that you get to pick and choose the menu; yes, I love that this gives you more replayability and an enormous number of possible configurations; yes, I love that there's a scoring track now; and, yes, I love that it refreshes a modern classic. But actually, one of my favorite aspects of this updated version is that the deck construction now means you'll have a random sample of the deck you've built in any given round - making it trickier to try and game out how many cards are left as the rounds proceed. This is one of my go-to gateways, one of my favorite fillers, and something I'll gladly pull off the shelf if I'm just looking for a quick burst of fun.

7/19/15 update: bumping this up. Over time, [b]Sushi Go![/b] has really cemented itself in my collection. I'm actually going to say that I like this more than [b]7 Wonders[/b]. It gives me 90% of the 7W satisfaction with 5% of the teaching difficulty (people seriously get overwhelmed with all of that 7W iconography) and none of the scoring annoyance - yeah, yeah, I know there are apps, but that's a solution to a problem that never should have existed in the first place. 7W may have more depth, but I've learned, over time, that I don't actually care all that much about depth in my drafting game. I'll take 15 minutes of crazy kawaii any day.

Cool little game. Adorable artwork, easy to learn, quick to play, lots of fun. Good gateway to 7 Wonders if you have civilians in the group.

RATING: 7
Fun game, kinda filler-ish but seems to take a bit longer than we always think it will - set-up and packing away is likely a part of this, as it's quite a pain.

Like: It's generally clear what's going on, how everyone is doing, and how best to maximise scoring in any given hand of cards. Blocking other people's scoring is done more often than in 7 Wonders, which makes the game feel better as a result. Card drafting as a mechanic is fairly interesting. 

Dislike: Every game plays out fairly similarly, although varies based on cards selected in each game. Because the same cards are used each round, there's no feeling of escalation or progression through the game. Some players take way too long to make simple card selection decisions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Better than Sushi Go!, which I guess means "9". It's an excellent drafting game, occupying a slot between the base Sushi Go! and Fairy Tale in terms of complexity. It adds enough flavor that it feels new, without adding a lot of new rules or tedium. The scoring board and additional space for two players is also much appreciated.

The only downside to this thing is that the box has officially unseated Alea Iacta Est in my mind as the absolute worst insert ever perpetrated upon the gaming public.

RATING: 7
This is a cute fast game.  It uses card drafting where you start with a hand, keep one card, and pass the rest to your neighbor.  You keep passing the hands around until they're all taken.  When you take a card, you play it in front of you.  The cards are mostly all types of sushi that give you points in different ways (fixed, for a set of two, for different kinds, etc etc).  There is a certain amount of strategizing on what cards to keep, based on what you think the other players will be keeping.  There are many possible types of cards and only a subset is used for a game, increasing replayability since the game goes differently depending on the cards in the deck.  Not a lot of thinking but enough to make it engaging.  The theme of yummy sushi keeps it light.  Good filler game.

A simple game, in Sushi Go Party! players choose a card from their hand and pass the remainder to the next player and so on, trying to collect different card combinations for points.  The player with the most points after three rounds wins.  This is a family level game that does not have a huge amount of strategy, but does require the player to remember which cards are still floating in the hands and either block other players by taking needed cards, or choose cards that progress combinations and increase points.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (December 2017)

I had already played Sushi Go, so I was pretty sure what to expect and I was right. Sushi Go Party is a good drafting game, but it is way too light for me. I prefer it over 7 wonders though as they both have the same game considerations, but Sushi Go is very unassuming and a lot faster to play and explain.
 
Sushi Go Party! can be explained under 7 minutes and played under 30 minutes.

The art of the cards is pretty good.

I dislike the theme, but you don’t feel it through the game.

I´m not sure how many cards adds this edition of Sushi Go, but it has a lot more cards than the previous edition of the game (so the replay factor increased a lot). It also comes with a board to keep score and some preset sets to play, good additions.

Gameplay is very simple, but it is also fun. In each round you have to choose a card and play it and then you pass the other cards around. That’s it! Choosing the best card for you isn't very complex and luck often play a role in the game as well, but as it is a very short game, I don’t mind the luck factor.

Sushi Go Party is pretty cheap to buy.

On the bad side, if you sleeve the cards you cannot keep them in the tin (or the sleeves get wrinkled corners), and that’s too bad because the tin is big enough to hold all the sleeved cards, so the publisher could have allowed for the sleeved cards easily.

Bottom line, Sushi Go Party! is an excellent family game, but it is way too light for me. It can be also a great game to introduce to new gamers. I think it is one of the best drafting games out there. I already sold my copy of the game, but I would gladly play again if requested.

1 play: I have never played the original. I played with the recommended setup for 1st timers and it was fun. Played with my fiance and her non-gaming roommate. They both liked the gameplay, ease of playing, and especially the theme: CUTE. SUSHI. FACES!!! This will be easy to get to the table compared to my dust collecting copy of Dead of Winter. Looking forward to the other cards such as the more aggressive setup.

EDIT: I have played it over 8 times, and personally as a hobby gamer, I'm kinda over it. I don't mind playing it if someone suggest it. HOWEVER, this is an Essential game for me because it appeals to non-gamers. Even as a filler game, its good, but the niche for sushi go party is that it is an essential game because of its broad appeal. I would still have it as an 8 because it offers so many combinations of set up that I will never get bored while playing.

RATING: 7
I played Sushi Go! for the first time earlier this year and I quickly realized that THIS was the game I should have played with the non-gamer in-laws, NOT 7 Wonders, which had their heads reeling with the various ways in which cards are used and scored. If you keep a few games on hand that you can play with virtually anybody, this should be one of them. Is it cute? Check. Easy rules? Check. Enough uncertainty and risk-taking to keep everyone engaged? Check.

I held out on picking up the game until this version came out and I'm glad I did. The party box has a lot more variety and allows for different mixes of cards for different play styles, a la Dominion. There is more shuffling and effort to set up a game because of it, but it is totally worth it for the increased replayability. I score this a point higher than vanilla Sushi Go! because of it.

Great gateway card drafting game.  A top 10 filler for me and a great game in its own right.  With different set options, you can determine what type of game you will be playing: cut-throat, high risk/reward, or friendly drafting game.  Select your sets of cards based on the people at the table.

I would play multiple games of Sushi Go! Party back to back.

Although I have never played the original Sushi Go! I had tried games like Fairy Tale. This game is far superior.

Upped rating from an 8 to a 9 as I think everyone should own a copy of this game. Drafting games are the most fun with 5+ in my opinion and this plays very well with 7-8 which is rare outside of deduction games. I would personally say best with 5-8, but regardless a great game in any collection.

This is a good game, but unlike what seems to be the general consensus, this does not replace Sushi Go for me. Taking a light game like this and introducing Dominion-like setup is not the greatest idea, and setup/putaway is really annoying.

Sushi Go goes to the next level with tons of new scoring opportunities.  Replay value out the wazoo.  Plays up to 8 I believe.  I enjoyed Sushi Go alot and this just adds more to that formula.  

A few notable cons keep this from rating higher ultimately...for one, the tin just doesn't work.  The manual has bent corners because of how everything fits in there.  The bookkeeping for the different sushi's is a bit of an obstacle, as you really need to keep everything organized now that it's more modular.

Takes deckbuilder style card rotation system to create variation to drafting. Due to variety the balance issues of basic Sushi Go! are eliminated, although the setup is quite time taking. Plenty of replayability and a smart and compact score board. Props for cuteness. The tin box sucks. I can't understand using tin instead of regular cardboard.

RATING: 7.5
While undeniably light, this game is the purest iteration of what drafting games can be: you have to look at what you're giving the next player, and what others are picking up to know what is likely to make its way to you. There are no frills added to it, making it effortless to understand what you need to give and what you need to keep.

Fast, cute and fun drafting game. There is a great variety in this box and most of the cards really feel different. However, I really feel big tin boxes shouldn't exist anymore. They get bent they don't fit really well and in this game you can't store it sideways. Comparing this to the original I kinda like the portability of the original one. Setup and takedown of this takes a bit longer and you need to shuffle between rounds but in terms of replayability and variety this one beats the original.

Definitely a hit in our house. I appreciate the 2-player recommended "menu" since I often find myself playing games with either my husband OR my 11-year-old. Bonus that the game plays very well with 3 for when we all manage to play together. Husband likes non-confrontational games, so we can pick food items to accommodate that. Son likes to force me to get that third tofu whenever possible. :) Quick, fun, and a great intro to card drafting that even the in-laws have enjoyed with us. Only con for me is the miserable insert.

Certainly makes for a lot more interesting combinations to explore.  However, initial set up and pack away almost takes as long as it does to play a single game (worse than dominion as the card sets have to be selected, then thoroughly shuffled together and then all separated and then packed away at the end).  Shuffling after every round also adds a bit to the game play length.

We've mostly played this 2 or 3 player.  With 2 players the game is a bit different since it's pretty easy to remember what is in the other hand once you've seen both.  That doesn't really make it worse though there are a couple cards that are more difficult to complete sets of with 2 players.  The tin absolutely does store all of the cards correctly but we find it takes too long to put away that way so what we do instead is keep a running menu and store that deck in the tin.  Each time we take it out to play a game we swap out 1 or 2 sets of cards for something else.  This really speeds up setup and take down time.  After playing this version I couldn't imagine playing just the original Sushi Go game instead.  I suppose it costs about twice as much once discounted but must offer at least 5 times the value in variety and longevity.  It's also accessible for our 8 year old and non-gamers while still being fun and entertaining for more seasoned gamers.  We absolutely don't care for sushi and have always avoided the game in the past on theme alone.  However, having no real knowledge of sushi doesn't seem to have affected our families enjoyment of the game whatsoever.

All the benefits of the normal version with a very useful score board which avoids using a paper/pencil and also provides a visual reminder of how everyone's doing. The reminder cards in the middle of the board are a good way to fill the space but I didn't use it as all the info you need is on the cards. Being able to pick from a menu is also a good idea to vary the game but slows down the game setup (plus extra shuffling) and slows packing away.

I like the new cards, but set up time is increased, which means it doesn't get played. I'd rather just have regular Sushi Go in my bag, ready to go. The original is a smaller box too, which takes up less space than the Party edition. The party edition is a great idea though for those who are playing at home and prep ahead of time. My fillers are generally travel games, so they need to be fast and small.

Ein weiteres Draftspiel, aber der sehr einfachen Sorte.
Jeder Spieler erhält x Karten und darf eine behalten… etc.pp…
Es gibt Karten die bringen direkte Punkte, es gibt Karten die geben erst Punkte wenn man 2 davon hat oder für andere braucht man schon 3 gleiche Karten. Karten die abgeworfen werden müssen wenn jemand anderes sie auch gespielt hat und Karten die Punkte für eine andere Kartenart geben... die Auswahl ist dabei sehr groß und bei jedem Spiel eine andere.
Es spielt sich sehr flott und hat mich an "Die holde Isolde" denken lassen, da man auch hier draftet und bei jedem Gegner sehen kann, was dieser sammelt und es ihm ggf. wegnehmen kann.
Das Spiel war ganz nett, aber da gibt es viele bessere Spiele, die eine vergleichsweise Mechanik bei vergleichsweiser kurzer Spieldauer bieten.

RATING: 8
Sushi Go! was a game I was so hyped on it single handedly convinced a friend to get it. This was pretty much because I never buy board games for myself so we never actually played it, but having played it over TTS with randoms I can confirm it was actually pretty damn good. So I could just imagine what it would be like to play with friends I know and actually enjoy gaming with. Then I played it, and it was about as great as I expected, so I knew I had to get it.

I am one to wait for games to get down to that magical price and convince me to get it, so I waited with Sushi Go! So long that Sushi Go Party! was both announced and released, and then Sushi Go Party! got to that magical price. SGP is basically SG but with a lot more cards (yay), a board (yay), and a really helpful insert (yay). There are a LOT more cards and it's essentially Dominion-style where you can just swap cards in and out of your plays depending on what you want to play with. So it's basically just Sushi Go! but better, because it has more stuff, and if you really want to, you can play with the base set anyway. Can't wait to get it and play it, and I know it will be great.

Solid, compact, streamlined drafting game.  Adds a little more time to the original game because you select the different cards that will be in each game.  But I'm assuming you get this after you have played the base game for a while and you want more variety, and this gives you that.

I have liked all the cards I played with, some more than others.  But it adds more interesting choices and strategies.  I don't think I will ever get tired of this game.

Very cute art of course helps.  We always end up very hungry for sushi by the end of this.

Adds a lot more variety with the different options of what cards to add, at the expense of increasing setup time. Some of the new cards feel more interesting while only adding a slight amount of complexity compared to the original game, but others feel a little bit wonky. If you didn't like the original the new cards I don't think adds enough depth to change your mind, but if you were looking for more variety definitely check it out.

Originally I had been holding out for the party version, but we found the original on sale. Now glad that we got the original.

Great expansion of the original game.  The original game play elements are there and the flexibility of what cards you want to include help give variety that should keep game play fresh in future playings.   It also helps adapt the deck so you're playing with rules that play best with the group you've got at the table.  The score track was a nice idea, but it actually proved to be a bit cumbersome.  You're better off just using a pad and paper to keep things moving along.

After playing this a few more times, this is a replacement for Sushi Go.  While it isn't as travel friendly as the original Sushi Go and the set up can take some time, the diveristy in this game is insane.

Besides a few pre-made setups, you can customize your game on how you want to play.  You can have a game with numerous ways to get points or a game with many obstacles to deal with it.

Best of all, it does play just as well as 2 players as well as up to 8.  

While it isn't nearly as strategic as games like 7 Wonders or Fairy Tale, especially since the decision making in this game is very light, the push-your-luck elements with collecting sets of cards to score points (or losing points for going too far) is something I haven't found with many other pure drafting games.

The setup is a bit more annoying than the original because you have to shuffle between rounds, remember to add in dessert cards as you go, and separate out cards when you're done... but the added variety makes up for it. The art is as delightfully cute as ever, and the scoreboard and sake player tokens are a great addition. This definitely has the potential to go up in score as I try out more of the new cards.

I like the implementation of the board, and that it shows what cards are available on the menu each game, as well as a scoring track conveyor belt along the outside. The new cards are cool, i like a few of them, but i prefer the original game. Sushi go party, much like Coup G54, mucks up simple elegance of the original. It's variability makes things too complicated and takes away from the base game that has cards that everyone already know. If i was teaching a new person, i would definitely prefer the original. And while i really like the thematic conveyor belt score track, it's really small, no more than two pieces can be on the same space; and that's pushing it.

I've rated this game very highly, not because I enjoy it so much, but because of how easy it is to bring out. The box and the cards are immediately eye-catching. the theme is cute and universal. I can open this game for two people all the way up to eight people, and the game is still fun.

FUN: a 5 minute rules explanation makes this a good gateway to drafting games. The nice theme and art seal the deal.

UNIQUE: the most accessible drafting game I know.

NEGATIVES: although this version of Sushi Go offers a lot of new options, it’s still not as deep as 7 Wonders or Fairy Tale.

The new cards are fun and there is more variety here, but I´m satisfied with my original game in a smaller box suitable for a light filler. If you don´t own the first game this is the obvious verison to buy.

A light game that is too long for its good. None of the choices is exciting. Scoring is a chore since it heavily depends on the cards of others.

Good solid game,  but I have 7 wonders so the drafting mechanic isn't new to me.   Introduced this and codenames to my non-gamer friends.   This one was a little flat in comparison, mostly since the interactions are a bit more muted.   To me it is less of a party game and more akin to a gateway game.

Okay, so you pick the best card and pass to the left.  Then you do that some more times until you tally points.  More interesting than rolling dice to reach a high score.  The spoon is a fun card.  Not a bad way to pass the time, anyway.

It is very, very cute.  I like the illustrations a lot.

Put simply this new version of Sushi Go makes the original completely redundant. It certainly doesn't reinvent the wheel, but what it does do is repackage the classic game along with a massive selection of new cards. Turning what could be seen as a pretty basic card game into a massively repayable one by allowing players to tailor the menu to suit their gaming desires.

Everything that was good about Sushi Go, but with much more variety. Would be near-perfect, if they'd used better quality components. The cards are falling apart after just a few plays. I would gladly have paid twice the money for better quality cards.

IMHO this is THE first step, must play before trying out 7 wonders- especially with non-gamers. Started out with regular sushi go, gave it away and then picked up Party. Not really a party game but the game is cool coz you can expand scoring options. Once this is “mastered” bust out 7 Wonders. Or play this...

Hmmm, so it adds some categories....but then it creates a framework to not use all of them all the time so it forces a "replayability" factor?  EH...I see what they are doing but I prefer the original.  I don't hate it but I don't see the change in setup changing my play choice

This blows regular Sushi Go! out of the water. Now you can customize your deck before playing, play more people, and there's finally a board to keep track of both the players' scores as well as the scoring conditions for the dishes chosen for the deck.

I would say the only reason to still hold onto the base game is for the sake of portability.

If I had to say a single thing I didn't like about the game, it would be that I really don't like that big lumpy tin it comes with.

This is, quite probably, my favourite party game. I choose my words carefully as that title was (previously) very hard earned by One Night Ultimate Werewolf. It's quick(ish), simple and amazingly fun. The variety of items to mix and match with keep the game fresh and there's dozens of different strategies to take - none better than the others. There's a good amount of luck involved, but attentive players will usually win out against those only focused on what's in their own hand. I absolutely love it.

Hearing the reviews about how much an improvement this game is over the original Sushi Go!, and it is not an overstatement. The game has so much versatility and replay-ability, that the game pretty much speaks for itself.

The card drafting is very straight forward and works well, the cards are designed well and are very clear. Works for all ages, and should be recognisable to everyone.

Very good introductory card drafting game.  The theme is light and easier to draw in newer gamers.  The Party version replaced our normal version due to the higher player counts and variability.  Not my favorite card drafting game as I prefer games a little heavier in that mechanism, but a good game to introduce the play style and to get non gamers involved.

This completely replaces "Sushi Go!".  The great card drafting from the original game is still intact, but this time the variable menus really increase the challenge and replayability of the original.  This can be played as either a filler or a full game all by itself, which is a rare combination. The only con that I can think of is that not all strategies are as viable for victory as others, which restricts the versatility of certain strategic options.

[b]Sushi Go Party![/b]

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8/10 -> 8)[/COLOR]

[i]My feelings on Sushi Go Party have cooled a bit, but I still think it is the perfect gateway drafting game. In fact it's perfect for younger kids making the transition from children's games to more advanced games. We've recently been playing a lot with my 7 yo daughter and she loves it, she finds the artwork appealing and really likes the drafting element. With very little help she manages to do quite well on her own. For me, Sushi Go has ended up becoming a family game to play with my kids, but isn't a game that's been played at my local meet up. There are other quick games I'd rather play; it's possible the variable set up hinders the game because of increased set up and rules explanation time, there are other games that are easier to take out and play when looking for something quick to play. 

I still enjoy playing and would definitely recommend it to families, especially if you have younger kids who want to play "your" games [i](as my daughter phrases it)[/i].

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8/10):[/COLOR]

[i]- Perfect family game, easier to teach than 7 Wonders so if you're looking for a gateway drafting game this is it!
- This is a very easy card drafting game to set up and play, probably 20-30 minutes max.
- More whimsical art that will appeal to most people [i](unless you have no soul)[/i]
- You set the menu [i](with a lot of choices)[/i] - the game board has slots in which you put tiles for the cards you will be playing with that game.
- There is a board which means you no longer have to keep score with a paper and pencil. I know this may not seem like a big deal, but it makes it much easier to keep track of everyone's points.

A close runner up to Qwinto this month. I've played once with 4 and once with 2 and it was fun at both player counts. I really appreciate how this builds on the original Sushi Go by adding a lot more variability to the game. The biggest problem I had with Sushi Go was the repetitive nature of the game once you played a few times. There are a lot of fun, new cards added to the mix. I especially appreciate the new specials cards change up how points are scored and cards are distributed. There is also the option to introduce a lot more player interaction in to the game depending on the cards you play with, there are a lot of cards that work off of what other people have played. These effects can be either good or bad for you or the other players depending on the card. 

I'd recommend this even if you didn't love Sushi Go, there are so many cards to choose from that there will likely be set ups you will really enjoy playing if you like card drafting games. [/i]

I gave Sushi Go a 9 and this gets the same score as well, at least based on first impressions. Played the party sampler version with 6 year old son and wife. Loved how different yet similar it feels. I initially felt a bit uneasy shuffling all the cards back together again after each round but can see how it increases the ambiguity and prevents card-counting given the smaller deck size. Would love to try with other card combinations!

Sushi Go Party is just a BRILLIANT, simple, and thematic  card-drafting game.  If you like Sushi Go, then this is a no-brainer expansion.  (If you haven't bought Sushi Go, you don't need it; go straight for Sushi Go Party!)

Having a board with a scoring track is super helpful, and having all of the different card-types that you can mix and match into the game is just wonderful.  It's the top card-drafting game in the genre, in my opinion.

Recently added to the top of my pile of filler games, this is drafting in its most pure form.

A charming "pick and pass" drafting game that has a lot of variety and is a great game to use in family/casual situations.

They are a bit flimsy and some cards are a tad longer than others making shuffling difficult.

Like the original Sushi Go!, Sushi Go Party! is a 7 Wonders-style card drafting game in which players are trying to collect different kinds of sets of cards for various point totals, played over three rounds.  What this "Party" reimplentation adds is hot-swappable card sets--you can replace entire sets of cards with entirely new sets of cards that have different scoring rules.  While some of the new cards are a little wonky (the Spoon, for example), I really like the variety this kind of things adds, and the rules about what can be swapped for what preclude bad combinations from coming out.  The game also can accommodate up to 7 players, which is a big plus, and includes a scoring board for those who don't have a pen and paper handy.  While the setup time is now a little bit extended, I think this is a great filler that can now take a lot of players.

Love the regular version.

The party version gets another full point (to a 9), for it's variable gameplay, score board. Loses a half point for low quality cards.

Still, it's a must-buy for me, and I would consider this an excellent light game to play with hobby gamers, or a fantastic intro game for casual or non-gamers.

Great fun, this game would be a 10 would top notch components.

Very fun game, has everything Sushi Go has plus more! More ways to play, more cards to choose from, means more strategies! And you can play regular Sushi Go with this set so there's really no reason to buy the original Sushi Go set. I won't pull out regular Sushi Go again now that we own this deluxe version.

I enjoyed this game like Sushi Go and liked its replayability with different cards to give it a semi-Dominion feel.  The board had a nice track.

This version had flimsier cards and an odd container and insert.  I'd like better components sim to original Sushi Go.  Additionally, the extra rules turns the Sushi Go game from a lighter party/gateway game into a deeper game, so no longer a "party" game with casuals.

Very good party game, especially nice that it plays up to 8 players.  Basic rules and game play are easy to learn.  Strategies about which cards to try to collect will take more time to learn.  It's also nice that there are so many extra food types with cards that the game seems to be replayable with enough variety.

RATING: N/A
The engaging aspect of this design is mainly the gradual reveal of the dealt cards as each player picks one and the hand passed around: it raises the uncertain questions as to which of the 8 contracts on the menu do I have a chance of fulfilling and will it provide enough victory points. 

It starts off with a little speculation (and a little tactic if you get to see you hand again more than once), but it then becomes an increasing memory and computational exercise as the unplayed hands become known. It is fun with coincidental plays, especially if they cancel each other out and there is that tension of do I play this card or will s/he play that card?

This edition provides variable contracts (either target quantities with riskier numbers paying out more or conditional such as only you playing or majorities) with fiddly set up and break down which won't be an issue for those who can't get enough of their sushi. For me I'm not so sure whether it is for my taste, with Ion building appealing to me more as that deck is more educational.

Sushi Go is an immensely accessible light drafting game: this is not a party game, but it does now play up to 8. The new cards work well with the larger numbers, although the administration is noticeably heavier and set up much more fiddly. That aside, I’m content to have upgraded. Tin came pre-dented thanks to Amazon, so that saved me having to ding it myself.

RATING: 6
I got sushi go to replace 7 wonders. I had gotten tired of 7 wonders after many plays, and although I like drafting as a mechanism, 7 wonders never really clicked for me. I thought a shorter, cuter version of a similar system would be a compelling filler game. It was for a little while. When Sushi go party came out, I was interested again. I thought Sushi Go could use some more variety, as it had sort of fallen out of favor over time. I got this, but when I played it, the additional setup steps and the extra breakdown time, and the very odd rule about the way the deserts shuffle in slowly, and how the used cards get shuffled back into the mix each round... well it just felt like a bogged down mess.

At some point I should learn that if a game isn't working for me, I don't need to pick up a similar but simpler game to justify getting rid of the first. It leads me down paths like this pretty much every time.

It's basically just Sushi Go with more variety and more setup/teardown time.

What I like in this version:
It has a score tracker so I don't need to track it with my phone. It can handle more players (up to 8 instead of up to 5). Each round is a bit more predictable and slightly more strategic, since you basically use the whole deck each round. I really like the gambles and tradeoffs on some of the new cards, like tofu.

What I don't like in this version: 
It takes significantly longer to get it set up, since you have to choose which 8 sets of cards you want to use and shuffle them all together, with additional rules on how many dessert cards to add to the deck each round. You have to reshuffle the deck after each round too. I don't like some of the new cards, like temaki, but it's easy to just not use them so it's not a big deal.

Have only a few plays of this after getting it at Gencon 2016, but am in love with the different cards and options they provide. Really excited to try it more, but I think this will completely replace the base Sushi Go game in my opinion. 

UPDATE: After reaching 20 plays, this is a very solid 9. Great drafting game which is one of my favorite mechanics. I love how the different combinations make you want to play out your strategy slightly different for every game. It is a very solid improvement over Sushi Go and I almost always am up for playing this. My one major complaint remains the Fruit desert card is not costed appropriately compared to the power of other cards, and so it seems optimal play is to just always grab as many fruit cards as you can. For this reason I tend to try to play without Fruit and wish another desert had been included, or that Fruit was just scored differently.

A fun set collecting party game. Played it with a full roster of eight and it was okay. It felt like there weren't enough options for messing with other players so it really was down to picking the best card for yourself. A lower player count might remedy this.
There are a lot of cards as opposed to the original which give the players a great deal of variety between games.

My first play of this game was very underwhelming.  I had heard so many great things about this game and I didn't find it interesting enough.  After having played a few more times, I've become less critical.

I still don't find it particularly interesting, but it's still pretty fun for a large group.  Of course I'm not generally a fan of light games - they just don't engage me very much.

Sushi Go Party is a really nice game, and a good improvement on the base Sushi Go. The increased variety of meals is great and the game scales very well. While I think it's best around 4-5 players, it scales and plays well at 8.
The beauty of the game is that it does have a strategy involved in the game, but it's incredibly easy for even new (or non-) boardgamers to get involved and enjoy. It plays quickly, but is a lot of fun for a "filler" type game. It's a perfect game to squeeze in between longer/complex games, or even to have in the final "1 last game" position.
Living in a German speaking country now, I'm glad we have the English version though - the graphics for the German version of the game are atrocious!

Never played regular Sushi Go, but just got this and have played 4 or 5 times with the normal Sushi Go card set. Very fun game, and my 9-12 year old kids also had a blast and were able to pick it up quickly. Seems like I usually come in last, but it is still fun. Haven't tried other variations in card types yet, but I'm sure those will provide some nice variety and additional playability. I love the artwork and the theme fits nicely with the game play.

As far as the components, the game board, pawns, and menu tiles seem like nice additions to the base game, BUT... I am pretty disappointed in the card quality. They are pretty flimsy and easy to bend, so I hope they hold up over time. Frankly I wouldn't mind giving up the aforementioned new components for better quality cards. Hope they eventually fix that in the next edition.

I'm torn on the party version, since there aren't enough cards in each deck to play 3 full rounds without shuffling like there are in the base game. Drafting games like this are dependent on being able to judge what's coming, and since you don't know which cards may be in play during any specific round, it ruins that strategy. Still an enjoyable light game to play with non-gamers.

Typical set collection game with card drafting mechanics. Lacks the tension needed for these type of games to work, mostly because the scoring is dull with many cards being too similar and/or giving more or less the same amount of points. The scoring is almost no incremental (i.e. every round nets you the same amount of points) and public, so after the first round (you play three) players who are behind have to make crazy risky plays to get back on board. At least it plays fast for what it is.

RATING: N/A
A sushi building card game. Each card has a sushi ingredient on it illustrated in a cute and playful style, with each type of card worth a different value. Certain cards can be combined to create a high value combo. They player with the most amount of points at the end of the game wins. 

Each player is given a hand of cards and plays only one card each turn. Players then switch hands with each other and play one card from this new hand, taking turns until there are no cards left. At the end of the round points are added up and a new round starts—three rounds total. Cards are shuffled and re-dealt in between rounds so that each time players have a new set of cards to choose from, requiring players to adapt their strategy every round. 

The challenge comes from choosing which card to pick. At the beginning of the round, there are many high value cards in your hand, but you can only choose one at a time. Will you play it safe or will you press your luck and hope the card you need will appear in your hand again? Towards the end of the round there are only a few cards left, so you have to try and make the best out of what's left over. 

Switching hands with other players is unique. You get to see which cards other players might pick and can try to remember what cards are in the other hands to make combinations for higher points. Being able to see all the cards, you can predict other players' strategies and try to sabotage each other if you can. 

The selection of cards used in the game are based on different 'menus' of ingredients. The rule book offers many recommended menus, each slightly changing the gameplay. These combinations, as well as the many different types of cards included in the game can increase the challenge and add to the game's replayability. 

The deluxe version comes in a tin and has a game board / pawns for counting points. 

Played with 2 and 3 players, as well as against myself to learn. The game can even play 6–8 players, but have not tried.

It is very similar to Sushi Go, except it has few more varieties. Not a huge change. It is still Sushi Go in core so it is still a fun game especially with non-gamers or kids.

Some good variation on the base game here. It loses some of its neat portability, but might make up for it with some good player interaction combos. Most cards are more of the same as in the base game and a couple (like spoons) fall rather flat with the wrong player number.

It's a great filler game while waiting for people to arrive for some real gaming. Very easy to teach and pick up. 15 minutes maximum playing time. Not very deep, but it's not trying to be. A wide range of player numbers makes it a very flexible filler. It certainly does what it sets out to achieve. Even though I don't rank it particularly highly it's still got a place in my collection for all its positive points.

2017: Started at 8, downgraded to 7. Easy to teach, plays 8 in a short period of time, takes a few minutes to explain and everybody understands it after one round. Has been (almost) a hit wherever I've brought it out and pleases across a wide range of demographics. And it has cute anthropomorphic sushi!

That said, with some recent sessions, the game's fallen flat.  It's cute but there's not a heck of a lot to chew on, game-wise. Know your audience before bringing this out.

I do tend to like drafting as a secondary or additional mechanic in a game (Sagrada, Kingdomino), but Sushi Go is pretty darn fun for what it is. The ability to have multiple different set ups makes the game feel different every time you play, which is exactly what you want in such a simple game. The artwork is super cute, and the rules couldn’t possibly be easier to explain. This game is a great 20 minutes filler for a larger group.

I love that this is a great party game that can be played with anybody, but it can become a quite deep game if the players are really focusing on optimising their choices and screwing the opponents strategies.

The Party! version is strictly better than the original. It features plenty of different card sets that let you vary player interaction, complexity, amount of points, etc. depending on the number of players and what interests the group. I'm looking forward to trying out the slew of different "menus" the rulebook suggests. It's a quick and easy (not to mention adorable) game.

A 7 Wonders és a Dominion szerelemgyereke a Sushi Go Party! És tényleg bébiről van szó, ugyanis édesapja egyszerű részeit örökölte, azaz a draftolást és a kártyák egyszerű pontozását, édesanyjától pedig a különböző paklik használatát játékonként. Egy adott játékban 8 féle pakli vesz részt. Ez keverjük és osztjuk szét a játékosoknak, akik fordulóként egyet választanak, majd továbbadják a maradékot. A forduló végén pontozunk, majd három forduló után végső győztest hirdetünk. A kártyák közül egy fajta, ami csak a három forduló végén pontozódik, a többi fordulónként. Vannak köztük teljesen egyszerűek, de interaktívak is. Egyszerű játék, amit akár 8-an is játszhatunk. Ami egyedül nem tetszett az a kártyák nem standard mérete és gyenge minősége. Tetszett, ezért akár nőhet is a pontszám később.

I have played this game a few times now, and have to say that as much as I loved Sushi Go, I love this one even more!  So much so, in fact that I cannot picture myself going back to playing regular Sushi Go anymore.  Sushi Go Party just offers so much in the way of variety to ensure that every game is different and you can employ different strategies.  In the last game I played we used the Miso Soup, and it was so much stress (in a good way) to play that card that it really made it clear how superior this game is to the original.  Love it.

[Gamewright 16 edition] {Food; card-drafting, set-collection, simultaneous-action; optimal 4-5} It is highly recommended by my game friends.

This game is cute, fun and addictive, an awesome family game. It can be played interactively or multi-solitude.  Typically, I would tell my friend that each card should be able to give you 3 points.

It is easy to teach but it would need time to explain the function of certain cards.  It is welcome by my friends and children.

The card tray is stupid - I don't know how to use this effectively. First, it doesn't support sleeves well.  Second, the indicate card, if standing up-right, blocks the card board and we cannot close the lid.  I would rather throw it away.

Fun, easy to learn light card game for 2-8 players.  All players get a hand of cards, choose one, then pass on the rest for an interesting mechanic similar to 7 WONDERS where you know what cards are coming around.  The PARTY edition is vastly superior to the standards, with a nice board and wide variety of goals.  (Including recommendations for setup depending on type of game you want to play (cutthroat, big scoring, family, etc)  Recommended.

It's impossible not to like Sushi Go Party! Its cute illustrations make you want to pick up and play it, and even when you're getting beaten, you can only smile at all the dinky little sushi faces. It's a great light entry into tabletop gaming, and is usually the first game pulled out when there are newbies. That said, it has great modular difficulty scaling, and the menu tiles mean people can refer to the specific card rules at any given time.

Sushi Go Party's greatest asset is its choose-one-card-pass-your-hand-on mechanic. It's such an ingenious device, that not only encourages strategic thinking and memorisation, but fits in perfectly with the game's theme – something a lot of games struggle to do.

My only quibbles are with the game's packaging. The tin the game comes in, while pretty and sturdy, is just an odd shape and difficult to store alongside most other board games. The plastic tray insert doesn't have enough slots for all the components, and it can end up a bit of a jumble. What were you thinking, Gamewright?

Don't let these gripes deter you, though. Sushi Go Party! is another great game night opener, or a rainy day filler, and I haven't met a group of people that haven't loved playing it. There is enough modularity to keep you coming back and in my opinion this should be a staple in anyone's tabletop arsenal.

tl;dr: see my [thing=133473][/thing] thoughts

Yes, this is 7 Wonders style drafting without the depth. Draft, score cards based on the type. Each type is scored in it's own distinctive way. Perfectly entertaining, but don't expect a lot of depth.

I was told this version has more types of cards. I didn't play the original enough to notice a difference. I don't think there is any reason to own both (if any)

Sushi Go Party did a few awkward things that make me feel like it is below the level of its predecessor, despite coming with the same card types:

1) It changes some of the setup rules, like shuffling desserts in interval requiring reshuffling of the deck.
2) It adds obnoxious cards like the menu which requires a deck reshuffle.
3) It had player number requirements for specific point values that are paid out.
4) It adds a board, meeples, and pieces, which while nice for scoring, seems somewhat unnecessary and adds bulk to the box.
5) Most of the other cards it adds aren't that unique, mostly doing similar things but in slightly different ways.

In the end I think I would have liked maybe only 1/2 the new card types they gave out, and they should have come as a small expansion with just cards not a replacement to the old game.  For me one of the plus sides to Sushi Go was its incredible simplicity and shuffle and go like quick setup, this game adds just enough overhead over the original to take that greatness away while not really adding much with all of the new cards.

Again, I am not saying this game is bad, not at all, it is a good game.  But seriously, the original Sushi Go has everything you need at an even cheaper price point and smaller box.  Don't bother with this, buy the original.

It's like regular Sushi Go, but more! I can take it or leave it. I've never thought to myself, "I like Sushi Go, but what it really needs is more, more, more!" Instead, I play Sushi Go as a light, fun drafting game when I'm in the mood to be sociable. In those situations, the fact that there aren't too many complications is an asset. So the party edition actually seems to work against its namesake. With other gamers, I suppose the added variety is a boon, but then again with other gamers, I'm typically playing something else anyway.

Only complain about it is cardstock and the box insert is not very friendly for storage.

High on my list of games to own eventually, Sushi Go Party! is actually a fun time. There is variety in the game and plenty of different ways to try and figure out ways to score points and to build up your collection of cards that you've drafted. I think that it's a lower threshold to enter to a drafting game than 7 Wonders which is why I like it better as it's easier to find people to play this game.

What a superb value!

Rather than simply cash in on Sushi Go!'s popularity, Gamewright have expanded on the base game and created quite a bit of replayability in the process. The system of randomizing each game's cards - and especially the way the board presents the information- is really slick.

That said, a big portion of Sushi Go's draw was its simplicity, ease of understanding, and low setup time.

Party probably makes sense for diehard Sushi Go vets who want more replayability, but it kills part of what makes me choose Sushi Go over heavier games like 7 Wonders.

This is a great game with lots of customized replayability, but it is a bit too simple for advanced players.  But besides the simplicity, it's a great way to introduce board gaming to newcomers and youngsters.  

Few things that I hate about this game are that some cards are used far more often than others, the slightly lower than the average card quality, and the way the storage is designed.  I would have not complained about this, if only the storage would fit sleeved cards, but since that's not the case, it is a bit tricky to properly take care of the cards. Without these problems, I would have given a score of 9.5.

But seriously though, this game is one of those very few games that almost anyone from age 8 to 100 or a total beginner to a highly advanced player can all enjoy to a certain degree, and that's not a small feat.

A clear improvement over Sushi Go. The easiest setup is simpler. The hardest setup is deeper. Easy to teach (though scoring can be a bit tricky for totally new players) and the theme reinforces the mechanics. The skill of guessing what other players are going for is easy to understand but hard to master.

Sushi Go Party takes the original game and slots in variety. If you want, you can exactly recreate the base game. However, now there are different types of cards that you can switch in and out. So instead of playing with pudding from the base game, you might replace that with Fruit, which scores in a completely different way. Or you might replace dumplings with one of the new appetizers, etc. You can select the food that is in play or randomize them.

And that's quite brilliant. Because different cards interact different ways. Some cards let your duplicate existing cards, some like having different types of cards, some like having long sets of the same color, etc. And so every game becomes a different thing where you have to think about the value of your hand given the set of what's in play.

In the original game you'd often know immediately the best card to keep as soon as you picked up your hand. Those values are no longer set and fixed but depend on what else is or isn't in play.

This does a lot to make the game fresh and interesting.

Light card drafting game. Fast-paced gameplay allows a lot more social interaction around the table than, say, 7 Wonders. To be clear, the game mechanics themselves are not interactive, but the experience is. The strategy comes from how the relative values of the cards evolve depending on how popular they are around the table, so almost as fun as a party game but with a thin layer of strategy, bluffing, blocking and misdirection to make it a gamers' party game (?)

Like its smaller cousin, but with more variety to keep things fresh.  The extra cards manage that elusive goal -- they reinvigorate the game and add extra options without making the rules any more complex for newbies.  And, because of the changing dynamic of the table and the great complexity, this now has the staying power to be filler for some time to come.  So simple to teach, and yet it has teeth -- this'll be a light game that stays in our collection, a real rarity.  There is one problem -- the cards quite quickly start to show wear, especially the nigiri which are present in all games.  As a result, the cards can become marked.  This is the rare game where it makes sense to sleeve, even for sleeve-averse players like me.

Came for the adorable artwork, stayed for the gameplay. I like the variability that Sushi Go Party! offers over Sushi Go!, although when we haven't played in a while we tend to use the menu items from the original game anyway. I like that the rulebook gives some set menu recommendations based on what kind of game you are looking to play. Sometimes it can feel like a lot to explain all the scoring combos with people who haven't played before, but the cards are pretty helpful in that they have reminders on them.

Pleasantly surprised by this title; I have this feeling it may hit the table a lot.  Recommended.

RATING: 8
If you haven't played Sushi Go, it's basically a streamlined 7 Wonders with ridiculously cute artwork. Sushi Go Party includes the base game and adds a ton of new variant cards to swap in and out of the deck.

Overall, this is a great edition. The art on the new cards is equally fantastic. The tile-based "menu" for showing which cards are included in the current game works great. And of course, the significantly increased variety is welcome and adds a lot of longevity to the game.

There are a few drawbacks though. First, there are some packaging annoyances: there's no good place to put the tiles in the box and the rules don't really fit because of the box's rounded corners.

More significantly for my group, Sushi Go Party takes a lot longer to get up and running. Picking the menu, building the deck, and going over the cards takes 5-10 minutes. That doesn't sound too long, but considering the game itself only takes about 15 minutes and is never the main event, it feels pretty substantial. This means that the shuffle-and-deal convenience of the original will probably still win out on a lot of our game nights.

Update: Turns out we almost exclusively play this now over the original. The variety is worth the extra setup/teardown. :-)

Art work is simply gorgeous. Tin is nice too except is wrong size! Select a card and pass the rest on, repeat until no cards left. Score what you have selected and repeat through twice more. Simple.  This party edition just adds loads of variety to the original base game so it has to be worth a higher rating than it.  I love it more with each play.

Pure fun -- the pick'n'pass mechanic has a feel of communality missing from, say, Dominion, and the rules are simple enough for literate 5-year-olds to understand. Serves as a nice little appetizer for 7 Wonders, if you're going that route, though the Party edition (vs baseline Sushi Go) gives decent replayability on its own. Enough randomness, enough colour, enough tactical depth to merit a spot at any family table; I do wonder if it would hold the attention of of a more gmae-savvy group for very long.

On the other hand, for $15 you'll unquestionably get your money's worth.

We also like having the additional menu choices with creative and interesting set collection goals, group play situations, and combos.

It has everything the original has and then basically four or five times more. A Classic.

Has a 7 Wonders sort of pass to your left one round, pass to your right next round, card drafting mechanic. Collect sets of cards, score points between rounds. Play 3 rounds and done. Maybe 30 minutes, max? 

Sushi Go PARTY is also vastly superior to other editions or the base since it has more cards and potential game combinations (you pick out different cards to be on the "menu" for each game). Comes in a nice tin box with dividers for organizing the cards.

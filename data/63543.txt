Horus Heresy is a really neat game. It's a long, heavy two player game. But I think it's worth it. 

The tactical card play, the initiative time track, and the card orders system are all really engaging. The units aren't quite as interesting as I wish they would be and the graphic design is darker and more oppressing than I would like, but it is an excellent and rich two player strategy game.

What an absolutely fantastic 2 player experience! So much so that i wish it was 4 player with orks and tyranids!! but It so perfectly simulates the civil war between the imperium and the traitor chaos marines.

Your choices are always interesting, there is tons of strategic depth, and the production values are through roof! With a 3D board and beautiful epic scale miniature the game is something to behold when fully setup.

The first beginners scenario took us 3 hours on first play and it was down to the wire and reading the other more advanced scenarios, six in total has me extremely excited about future plays, and I don't normally like scenario based games.

The orders system which cost resources that end up giving your opponent the next initiative sooner or slower depending on how involved the order you play is was a unique and fantastic mechanic.

I also absolutely love these card based battles where the size of your force determines the number of cards to draw and the round or "initiative" of battle tells you how many cards you can play at a time during. Because the combat cards have three ways to play them, for attack value, shield value, and/or special thematic abilities choices are always tense and interesting, the difference between a minor victory a major one or even a surprise defeated or forced rout all depends on how well and when you play them!

There maybe a bit more randomness at times with the defense lasers, orbital bombardment, thunder hawk bombs, and a few event cards that are super powerful and can end up swinging games, but both sides have access to these and such is the ways of war at times.

Great wargame for everyone, but this one especially appeals (+1 pnt) if you are a warhammer 40k fan as it oozes theme and little dynamic storytellings, especially is Horus assaults the palace!

RATING: 7.5
Didn't care much after the first scenario, but playing it again really made the game a lot more enjoyable.  There's a lot of subtle strategy in the game, and a lot of depth that isn't apparent right away.  Controlling the tempo as well as creating very favorable attacks is the key.  Planning a bit ahead (on the strategic map) doesn't hurt either.

Seems hard on the Chaos player, but that may just be a skewed feeling from my first couple games.

Played only once and it took us 8 hours with lots of rules checking and trying to figure out what to do. Unfortunately it had to go away before I was able to get more plays. But it's very good and a very serious strategy game. Not a lot of fun, but a lot of trying to plan ahead and completely ruin your opponent. Some very clever mechanics, like playing cards down into areas in advance.

Setup takes a long time given the static nature of unit placement and tiny plastic bits.  Game has interesting back story behind it but I am not a 40K player.  Play doesn't feel very epic and can start to feel stale toward end.  I don't see much replay value here.  Would play someone else's copy if they really wanted, but I wouldn't offer it up or buy it.

"Better than Beans".  Some Scottish guy reviewed this (or maybe it was Space Hulk) and the review had those immortal words in it.  "Its better than beans, its better than, better than... I canna think of anything better than beans."

A new purchase, as I look for solid two-player games for my collection.  I like the 40k backstory, and this looks like a really good game about such an important battle.  44 page rulebook = going to take some time to get to the table, as I normally concentrate more on learning games for more than two players unless it's for my wife and I.

Some positive feedback is encouraging me to make the effort to get this to the table.  Time to drill through the rules again and do another learning game.

This game's combat system of using the cards could be made into a much simpler dice mechanic using unit modifiers for quantity.... 

Also... the rulebook is extremely convoluted and wordy for no apparent reason... There are far too many useless rules and useless rule mentions in this rulebook...almost impossible to sit down and play without a clunky first  or second game... Very Hard to learn... must be played by expert gamers... Not for the Faint of Heart or the reading impaired...


All that said... the components are really nice.... and the the game in theory should be awesome... however, it has many major "fiddly" mechanics...

Great game, great bits.. love the mechanics in this one for combat.  I think it's going to take a few more games to really get the strategies.  My only complaint is the horribly small plastic inserts, and fitting in all the troops into those spaces, what were they thinking?  They could have included sub-boards at least.

It looks quite cool, but nothing in the rules made me believe it's worth $100. There are a few clever things in there, but most of it is standard lite war game stuff. Picked it up in a deal, hoping to see if it can exceed my low expectations. It certainly looks pretty.

An exceptionally large game that only supports two players, despite the number of people who could easily sit around the board.

The game is a recreation of the final battles of the Horus Heresy from the Warhammer 40k (or should we say 30k?) universe.  It does a good job of combining high-level strategy with small-scale unit tactics.  The asymmetrical objectives make for varied gameplay, and the components are generally well-made.

Fans of Warhammer will probably enjoy playing the game a few times, but it feels like it has limited replay value simply due to the relatively few scenarios.

Wow.  Awesome battle game without dice.  Like Starcraft, but this one is made for two players.  I can't understand the "bloat" criticisms I read.  There really isn't anything superfluous here.  And there's even less to learn than in War of the Ring - also a near perfect game.  I figured out most of the rules during a solo run.  Had to look some stuff up during my first "real" game.  Second real game - only referencing book rarely, and it was usually FAQ type of questions.

Highly recommend.

Thematically dense and pretty complicated, this is a really enjoyable wargame.

It's a nice compromise to enjoy that sort of thing without getting sucked down the rabbit hole of the Warhammer 40K miniatures hobby.

One of the best looking boardgames I own. My score is based after only a couple of plays so is perhaps not fair but the overwhelming impression is that whilst this is a good game, it isn't a very fun one. I need to play it more to nail down my exact criticisms with it but I haven't got rid of it because there is a good game somewhere, hidden beneath the stress of playing it.

I don't know how i feel about this game. On one hand, it's very good and i really enjoy playing it, on the other it's tedious.

Awesome game if you're a fan of the Warhammer 40K story. Decent game even if you're not (like me). Gameplay is asymmetric, sort of a mix between War of the Ring (one player is maneuvering units around and trying to attack a fortified defender) and Hannibal: Rome vs Carthage (hand management). 

I'm sure I would like it more if I liked the Warhammer 40K theme.

The manner in which the cards and initiative system tie together is very clever and well done. Combat is a little odd with the attacker/defender vs active/passive, but it works out alright.

I'm just not sure how much replayability you're going to get out of it with a static map.

The board is far too small and the ridiculous plastic pieces do not hold the figures properly at all. The game in the most balanced scenario is overbalanced to the Traitor player, making an Imperial win unlikely. Too many of the figures look too much alike. Not a good game and certainly not worth the $60 - $100 price tag.

RATING: 7
Horus Heresy is a fantastic game - and hits much of the same niche as "War of the Ring" for me, in that it's an atmospheric and deep two player wargame, with pretty pieces.

I'm sure there are cleverer Card driven wargame mechanics out there, but this one is pretty good, allowing for individual units to have special abilities without overwhelming everything in single-case rules.

Having grown up with GW and the fluff helps this one a bit in my case - although I do not enjoy their main line of games, the smaller games and background are pretty fun.

It's a solid, thematic two player wargame in 2-3 hours, with a theme that myself and my regular opponent both know intimately. Basically, it's perfect for me at the moment.

Space Marines, Titans, Cultists, Heroes, special abilities, different missions.  Theme galore.  Lots to like in this one.  It uses an initiative track to determine who's turn it is.  Kind of in a Thebes fashion.  The combat is unique and a very nice add.  Hard to describe but the designer has done a good job with it.  The rules take some getting used to and am looking forward to trying it again.  Rating could go up..doubt it will go down.

I think this game has been unfairly beat on. It's awesome! Comparable to War of the Ring in many respects and imo FFGs most innovative house design.

This is a game that really nails its narrative. I was in to 40k in the early 00s and late 90s, playing this game reminded me why the dark 40k universe is great. I'm not a GW fanboi though. Horus Heresy delvers an epic sweeping planetary invasion, with orbital strikes, assualts, drop pods, treachery, heros etc and in beautiful production. Takes about 2-3 hours.  The only real frustration i have with the game is that the cards can be a straight jacket until your experienced at play. Its quite difficult to move units from one region to another, meaning many units will do nothing in a typical game, equally lots of the special abilities on the battle cards only apply if the right kinds of units are present, meaning lots of interesting stuff like demons being summoned, can be rare. The other downer for me is the box size, too big for whats in side. I can see why peoples that payed £70 might be a little disappointed, the game here probably has less to offer than other games at that price mark, but in the second hand market i would recommend this game.

Sold this, and don't regret it.

Horus Heresy was a long, clunky and ultimately quite boring wargame for 2 players.

Don't get me wrong, there's some interesting stuff going on at times. Turn order is determined by who's falling behind the furthest in terms of "initiative" spend; the resource used to pay for order cards. 

Order cards are played from your hand either direct to the board for immediate effect, or to the strategic map for delayed effect. Playing cards to the strategic map can reduce the cost of some cards, and often gives you large bonuses for doing so.

So far so good, right? Well here's where it starts to get bogged down.

Units require different orders to attack and move. You cannot move units into a square containing enemy troops, you must play an attack order. Attack orders generally only target immediately adjacent zones.

Whenever an order is played on a unit, it is exhausted until a "refresh phase" is reached on the initiative track. This prevents it from receiving further orders. This means that it's often difficult to move units around the board if you ever plan on attacking with them.

When playing a move order, there are two limits to consider: the limit the order allows you to move (usually within a region) and the movement range of the individual units. But wait, there's more; jet ships can carry up to three units, and they move 5 spaces! For all other units, moving across a ravine counts as two spaces. Primarchs move three spaces, like space marines.

Primarchs - yes there are Primarchs! But sadly they have clunky rules as well. While they can fit inside a drop pod and take up zero space, oddly they aren't officially allowed inside a jet ship. The ruling on their special abilities is similarly weird and often unthematic; Angron (Beserker Primarch of the World Eaters) is somehow allowed to carefully and considerately select his cards before combat (rather than being rewarded for beserker charging in), and the strict wording on Magnus' (Sorcerer Primarch of the Thousand Sons) special ability means that he stops being magical indoors. Wait, what?

Combat outcomes are determined via combat cards; you draw 0.5 cards (rounded up) per unit of troop strength in a fight. The combat cards can be used for direct damage output or for effect. The number of combat cards that can be played at a time is limited by the length of the combat; a longer fight will allow you to play increasing numbers of combat cards.

Every so often, an "Event Phase" will occur. An Event Card is drawn and resolved - sometimes the effect strictly favours one player, other times it favours the player who drew it. There's one Event Card that should be banned; "The Sky Fortress Rises." It allows the Loyalists to grab the Emperor, all his Custodes (who, at combat strength 4 are the equivalent of Titans), Sanguinius and his Blood Angel marines (the best offensive force in the game) and teleport them FOR FREE AND WITHOUT EXHAUSTING THEM into Horus' warship. This kills Horus 99.9% of the time; it takes an additional 2 turns for Horus to send for help.

If this card is in the game, the Horus player has the option of (a) guarding his fort with all his best troops (fail strategy), or (b) praying that he can win before that card is drawn. Given that the Loyalists win by default at the end of the game... it doesn't look good for the Traitor player.

So if you've read this far, you've got an idea of how stupidly clunky this game is. I don't think I ever played it correctly - there was always some obscure rule somewhere in the manual that, on reflection, we were violating. And then we discovered "The Sky Fortress Rises."

Sold. Not looking back.

A brilliant, beautiful battle game that is lovingly crafted and sharpened to a point. staggeringly good stuff that I heartily recommend to any Games Workshop fan, or fan of these types of games.

The initiative track is a work of genius. It makes every move agonizing and compelling. The miniatures are nice (though not amazing) and the board looks great. The board could have been a little bigger as it sometimes is very difficult to jam all the units into one fortified area.

Overall i am delighted with this purchase.

A tentative 8 rating. I had a lot of fun with this, as it's apparent that FFG has learned some lessons from the design of Twilight Imperium 3 and Runebound, and put a lot of things I like about those games into this. I say tentative, as history has shown me to be a huge fan of the new and shiny, only to have the shine wear off after a few plays. We'll see about this one.

Really disliked this game where combat is the only real mechanic and seems to very much be a case of I attack with more troops therefore I draw more cards and therefore I win. The cards are very simplistic and the shields/damage ratings are so similar that it doesn't really matter in combat save who has the most cards to play.

In retrospect, this game is very much a niche product, so it's not too surprising to see it turn up as part of FFG's annual Thanksgiving mega-sale. That's a shame, because it's a fantastic game. Several of our plays have been absolute nail-biters. It'll be interesting to see how the different scenarios change things up, and I look forward to further exploring the Order decks and refining my use of Combat cards.

The fact that it's only a two-player game isn't really an issue for me: the way I see it, I only need to find one other player, which makes it a more practical purchase for me than Twilight Imperium, Runewars or most of the other coffin box games. Plus, I have several friends who are knowledgeable about the 40K universe, so I hope to be able to play reasonably often.

My only complaints are physical: the figures are pretty cheesy, and I wish there were specific daemon sculpts for each of the Chaos gods (Plaguebearers for Nurgle, etc.) instead of the generic ones. And cramming three Space Marines into a building space is a pain.

Another Fantasy Flight cardy war game that almost mostly works.  The cards don't feel like they work the way they're supposed to, either in combat or in strategy.  Perhaps this is my personal bias after playing Hannibal, or perhaps I have not explored the game fully enough.  Time will tell.  The game is also ridiculously over-boxed!  This should've been an FFG square box release.  Most of the contents are air.

Horus Heresy is a complex, wonderful riff on Epic Warhammer that pits asymmetric players against each other with the climactic backdrop of the fight for Holy Terra.

For those looking for a taste of Warhammer action, this is a great way to get your feet wet without buying a whole army.  For those finding themselves without the time for real Warhammer this can be a great game.

As a game striped of its art though, this is a tough nut for uncommitted players thanks to labyrinthine rules and a comprehensive yet still confusing rulebook.

RATING: 4
My one play of this game was not very encouraging.  I wanted to like this game.  I've heard all sorts of good reviews, but the actual play of the game came down to this:

The outcome of the game was determined by a random event card.

It worked like this, through a combination of good luck and some rules mistakes on our part, my opponent started the game essentially controlling all the space ports.  Through a great deal of careful planning I was able to kick him off one of them just in time to avoid the sudden death victory condition of controlling all the space ports by a certain point in the game.

I had a small but solid force left sitting on that port, whereas his forces on that section of the map were down to just a few minor infantry units.  He still had a good chance to take back the port, but it was going to take the same kind of careful buildup and planning that I had used to grab it in the first place.

Then we got a bombardment event from the event deck that ended up doing 6 hits, eliminating all but one of my units.  That allowed him to play an action doing one point of damage to my last remaining unit, eliminating it as well.  Then a simple movement took the port and won the game.

If the bombardment had been a carefully hoarded action that my opponent chose to use at just the right time, then it would have been OK.  I'd have been defeated by good strategy.  To be defeated instead by a single random card flip was infuriating, and exactly the kind of thing that I hate in games.  

So, for now this game gets a big fail from me, and I don't know that I'll ever take the time to give it a second chance.

I've also gone from thinking about buying it to giving it a pass.

RATING: 9
[b][i]Horus Heresy[/i][/b] is a heavily themed 2-player war game that delivers a truly epic confrontation in 2 to 3 hours.  I'm completely unfamiliar with the source material, but I don't feel this ignorance impacts my enjoyment of the game (with the exception of occasionally needing to check which faction was which color). The game mechanics of bombardment and drop ships dramatically evoke the planet invasion aspect of the theme, and the ship in geostationary orbit on the board's side is fantastic.

The game's mechanics are smooth, which is impressive considering the game's complexity. The initiative track--where actions are paid for with time--is clever and fun. The card-based combat is surprisingly tactical, quick, and tense; also, through variable unit special abilities, combat rewards combined arms in a satisfying manner. The miniature strategy board adds another layer of planning and nicely rewards preparations with action-packed turns. 

There's [i]a lot[/i] going on in this game. Decks of order cards providing a spectrum of commands to be issued; seven different generals with disparate special abilities; multiple paths to victory; air lifts; and more things besides. This complexity is not a negative in my eyes, but it does imply that several games are required in order to properly understand the implications of the 18 different kinds of units, for example. Reading this list of options might be daunting, but I will add that the game is designed such that most of these aspects make sense and blend into the background.

Gets better the more you play it.  The game can take a while, like 3-4 hours long, and it's only 2 players.  The card-based combat can feel a bit "gamey" at times when you look through your discard pile and consider the probability of drawing the next card you might really need for combat.  And you might end up drawing many of the cards at the wrong place and wrong time.  But for the most part, every game I've played, I've never felt as if I've lost due to luck.  After every game, I've always deduced why I lost, and how I could play better next time.  If that's not the sign of a good strategic game, I don't know what is.

The usual FFG issues loom; play time, and board warp.

I took the plunge and ordered this, as the reviews and comments make it look like something the Lady and I would like, along with a very good play time since two young kids make things really busy around here.

But man, does this game look great when set up.

I've given it a few tries solo, and it's a pretty good game, and likely better with 2, as the bluffing makes conflict much more exciting.
I'm not a fan of the fixed set-up, but that's probably the biggest issue I have with it, aside from set-up time.

I'm hanging onto it to play with my son once he's a little older. He loves the GW IP, and we'll have a good time with this soon I'm sure.

Wow, what a grinding game! Due to the difficulty of maneuvering troops, the board is actually much larger than it initially appears, and the body counts are high. I also really appreciate how the combat cards' special abilities allow units to be differentiated by more than just combat strength without adding additional rules complexity to the game.

I'm looking forward to playing this again.

I have never worked so hard to try to like a game more then I did Horus Heresy.  It's so beautiful to behold.  It has some things that I really like:  I think the combat is interesting, I like the leaders, I love the theme, but I finally decided the game is just can't get out of its own way.  The game is needlessly gamey, and endlessly clunkly.  Movement mechanics and random card draws make it almost impossible to do what you would like.  The Emperor player just waits, buries the Chaos players cards on the map, pushes the turn marker along. If Chaos manages to get out of his own way, get some cards that actually work together and get into the palace,  The Emperor just zips away in the sky fortress.  There is a good game in here somewhere but it's trapped under it's own weight, clunklyness, and overly complex rules.

In my opinion this game delivers in Warhammer universe the same experience as War of the Rings does in the Lord of the Rings universe.

Both have the same scale and are just filled with the theme. They both have also some nice and unique mechanics. Horus Heresy takes a little less time to play than War of the Ring which is a good thing for me, but on the other hand there is a little less battle than you might expect. So, I understand why some people can list that as problem.

I have never started collecting Warhammer armies but I have always been very interested in the storyline and the universe. For me this is the best way of playing in that universe.

RATING: 7.5
Holy shit this is awesome! Varied strategic and tactical options, a lot of decisions every round, highly abstract yet deep combat mechanics, and the initiative track mechanic is great as well.

Do not expect a huge lot of movement, or a combat system that is similar to the WH40k one. If you do that, you will be disappointed. The game is great on its own merits, and plays in the WH40k world, but is not just a bigger version of the tabletop game.

The order mechanic restricts your options only slightly because you can always draw back recyclable orders. Still, you need more initiative points to do that, and this potentially gives your adversary an advantage. It's always a fine balancing act between what you'd actually want to do and what the circumstances let you do easily.

The downside is, as I'm sure you'll read everywhere, that the whole package is pretty complex and requires lots of doublethink and what-ifs, while restricting your options at any given time through the command cards (and thus forcing you to think more about how you get to do what you want, too). Not really a very bad thing IMHO, but something to keep in mind.

Nice components, like the combat system.  First game was a lot longer then expected.

I had to keep referring to the rulebook to determine if I could play a card or not; an image and/or color of units could have been added to the cards.  Needs a player aid showing the various unit names as well as the name of each (color) faction (Khorne, etc.)

Hero's Space Marine color not obvious (I had trouble distinguishing between blue and purple).

Timing is everything here, and game requires at least a second play.  (Rating will probably go up 1)

Horus Heresy borrows heavily on other card driven wargames, wich is pretty cool i think.

The fixed game length is neat, resulting in the imperial player stalling as best as he can, while the chaos player tries to rush things as good as possible.

The artwork & minitures are as great as ever when Games Workshop & Fantasy Flight have a joint venture.

The battle cardmechanic also works very well, much better than in Starcraft. It gives a tactical element to what usually is determined on lucky die rolls. Wich conveys the feeling of having more control over the outcome, wich is neat.

To know if it's ballanced i would have to play it some more.
All in all a very shiny, enjoyable wargame.

Horus Heresy is a deep game with an impressive blend of mechanics: a card-driven action selection engine, tactical miniature movement, hidden orders, the crucial role of the initiative track, and a fluid diceless combat system. These design choices make for an extremely satisfying and memorable gaming experience. While this game contains a steep learning curve, it is worth the investment of time to learn to play. The rulebook is among the best I have read, making the game that much more accessible. This title is sure to please WH40K devotees, but you don't have to be a fan to appreciate the depth of the game. A truly remarkable achievement in the middleweight section of the wargame spectrum.

This is an awesome, EPIC, 2-player game & is worth every penny of it's purchase.  I love the diceless combat--attacks/damage/damage prevention resolved with Combat Cards--& the addition of Hero Combat Cards when a Hero is present in a battle adds to the drama of the combat.  This is a great way to dive into the world of Warhammer 40K without having to buy tons of minitures (along with the task of painting them) & still feel the madness of total, constant, neverending warfare of the 40K Universe.  The game only touches on one event in the History of the 40K Universe but does it extremely well in this solid, well-balanced game.  This is, by far, one of my favorite boardgames & I will be playing it a lot--dragging it out whenever anyone asks to play.

I like it less than the original GW design.  The time pressure on the Traitor player is so intense that the game feels more like a commando raid than a planetary invasion.  The card-based combat system all too often boils down to "he with more toys wins" and proves too much work for the payoff.  This is a game which craves being told how clever it is and tries too hard at times, like an overeager puppy.

First game was a poorly taught demo game at GenCon.  My opponent took the fight up to the Vengeful Spirit in round 2 or 3 and I won as Horus.

Got to try again with a friend two times very close together. I was the traitor both times. I really screwed up the first game, lost badly,  and wanted to try again. I won the second game.

Great tactical and kind of stressful game. Even thinking about some bold move that would give your opponent a bunch of room on the initiative track feels stressful and risky. Very unique in that way. Love the WH30K/HH feel to the game and love all the minis.

A quality game from Fantasy Flight. Once again they excel at what they do best, heavy chrome-filled slug fests. I enjoyed my time with this title.

As a result the game kind of drags a bit towards the end.

Creating a giant, toy-filled box for a two-player-only game is kind of a bold move, and apparently Horus Heresy fell a bit flat when compared to the other coffin-box games by FFG. After a single game, I think I’ve got a hint why the first impression might have been negative for a lot of players, and I also think they are wrong.

Let me try to explain: the game itself is a siege on Terra, the center of the human Imperium in the this-one-goes-to-eleven Warhammer 40K universe. The attacking player tries to take control of the four landing zones or kill the Emperor, the defender can either hold out long enough for reinforcements to arrive or kill the leader of the attackers. All this is done with a nifty mix of strategic and tactical play that seems somewhat overwhelming at first, but quickly gels into a smoothly playing engine.

However, there are also some event cards, determined by the scenario, that have a huge impact on what happens, and it is absolutely essential to know them beforehand, especially for the ones that are programmed to happen last in the introductory scenario. I was hit by them without prior knowledge, which turned the game on its head and made for disappointing and somewhat cheesy ending to what had been a very enjoyable and dramatic battle.

Accordingly, my rating is less for the first game I actually played, but rather for how I expect the game to be when you are better acquainted with it, either be repeated plays or by giving the specific scenario conditions, including events, a close read before your first game.

RATING: 7
After one play it get the standard 7. I like it, the production is great and well the story is classic 40k. I worry about this diceless combat trend we are seeing from FFG. For me I like rolling the bones for combat. The card system in this game is interesting but ultimately its a very simple sub-game and I am not sure it adds enough, I never felt there were many interesting decision around playing the cards and would rather then just toss some dice.


After 2 I feel better about the combat system, but still think it doesn't do anything that tossing a few dice would not do faster and with more excitement. 

Time to try a non-intro scenario.

I will be the first to admit I was attracted to this game by it's components.  But then, I found out a very deep and tense gaming experience.  Early on, it felt like replayability could be an issue, but we persisted.  Every time we play the game, we end up finding new strategies.  No game end up the same way.  When you get confortable on how to manipulate the initiative track, the game become a lot more interesting.  That particular mecanic is kind of unique and require some experience to take advantage, as it makes a huge difference in the game.  Do not judge the game after 1 or 2 plays, it's worth a couple more try.  A game I would play anytime, wich is a 10 for me and is still my highest ranked game.

There is a lot going on in this game: much theme, much chrome and much complexity.  The first game will be a learning game.  Either be prepared to play it a number of times or don't bother.  Initial rating after one game is 7.5 - keen to play again with the same opponent shortly in order to consolidate the rules, and be able to focus more on gameplay /tactics /strategy. 

Variable player order is something I really enjoy.  Combined with dudes on a map, preloaded to avoid the tedious build up.

Innovative and fun. Two plays- one where we misunderstood the initiative mechanic and the Imperial just 3 pipped his way to victory, and another where he didn't appreciate how close he was to a narrow spaceport defeat...

Lots of toys, tough decisions and loads of chrome and feel.

i think the original GW effort was a bit better.  wish that the heroes and space marines had a bit more differentiation and I enjoyed the old way they handled the various IG strengths and the warbands/demons on the Chaos side.

Borrows from RuneWars a bit.  Some of the units in the first couple of scenarios are just there for display and likely will not see any combat.  Some of the later scenarios allow for more strategic placements at the outset.

Baffled at how some of the components work.  3D stuff looks initially, but was probably a poor choice given that most of them are way too small.

Wow, FFG, way to turn a mediocre game into something outstanding.  Secretly a CDG, as the order cards control the ebb and flow.  Combat, also card driven, on the other hand, will find you without the cards you need most, but that is a good thing.  Every move, every choice is pure trade off- play this card, but move too far down the initiative?  Block an attack, but lack a counter attack?  Put it in strategic and risk not having it?  Each game I have played is a nail biter.  If I had to complain, the plastic board inserts are thin, and are not flat on top, as well as being too small for all the pieces to fit inside.

RATING: 7
A solid tower defense game, that combines mechanics from several other games into a conflict rich system. Does a great job of capturing the theme. My only complaints: 1) the plastic fortress pieces are neither big enough nor flat enough to accommodate units on top of them--everything stands crookedly or falls off - especially the hero chits. 2) It is a REALLY long game. That, plus limiting it to only two players means it won't get to see the table very often - even War of the Ring has a three/four player variant.

RATING: 7
Solo play only.  

So far it has very interesting mechanics, a solid theme, and some very good bluffing elements.  As the game relies heavily on the bluffing aspects, it does not make for a good solo experience.

The rules are more cumbersome than Forbidden Stars, but there are some areas where this shines a little more for a more balanced two player experience.

Rating for now is a 7, which may change when I play as it was intended to be played.

Horus Heresy is a beast of a game. A truly epic battle that offers a genuinely deep 2 player experience due to its excellent order and battle system. There are loads of unit abilities and other little intricacies that really count in each and every fight. Thus, it definitely takes some time to learn how to utilize all of that stuff to the fullest. Indeed, the learning curve could prove to be quite steep for some players, but for people acquainted with other big FFG strategy games it should be like a walk in the park. The game looks amazing, although the figures sometimes lack space when placed in fortifications. The visuals are outstanding nonetheless, so just add the epic flavour of the whole Horus Heresy setting and you get the idea. All in all, this game only gets better with each play and the TONS of options it offers really come to shine only after a few plays. Therefore, don't be disheartened if it seems sooo overwhelming! Just give it a try and you will see the immense diversity of strategic options this game offers.

EDIT:

Updated the rating after ten more plays. This game is simply brilliant and I can't get enough of it!

EDIT:

Two years later and I still love it! This is one of the best games (if not the best two-player game) of all time!!!

Visually awesome game. Covers the Chaos attack on Earth in the Warhammer 40K universe. It captures this bloody sci-fi battle well. The hordes of attractive miniatures and the 3D mapboard, while stunning to look at, can be quite confusing and fiddly, with units difficult to tell apart and unable to fit easily within certain spaces. The identification aspect can be solved easily with some player aids. The fiddliness is worth putting up with as the games is very enjoyable and appears well balanced after one play.

Pretty good game.  Presentation (components, board, and artwork) are great (it is Fantasy Flight of course).  Even though I'm not that familiar with this universe, VERY thematic.  Plenty of room for tactics and strategy.  I like the Action point allowance/Initiative track, the hidden orders, and the card battle system.  Not sure if luck plays too much of a role in this game??? Although I'm sure it helped me win my first game, which was quite EPIC!!!  Only thing that prevents me from picking this game up is the huge box.

Fantasy flight games questionable rules. They should learn to streamline their rulesets more.

When overcomplicating things, they should examine how many questions they get from new time players. This one was far from their worst, but still at some point I stopped checking rules to get the flow going.

The overall game is simple enough and fun. I'd not rate it as a favorite, but I had a good time playing it. The components are as always the highest of FFG quality, but they need to fit into the 3D structures they made for this game.

If you're a fan of the 40k-universe, definately get this. Otherwise you won't be missing anythin you couldn't get in another more streamlined game. 1989 - Dawn of Freedom is very similar, and is to me a better game.

The initiative track is innovative and would be a great addition to other game designs.

Components : pretty nice visual effect.  No worries about pieces breaking.

Gameplay : moves pretty quick once you figure out the flow.  Both players should stay pretty engaged the entire time.

Rules : no issues playing out of the box, but there seems to be a number of instances where a condition will occur that is just not really mentioned in the rules.  This is not a gamestopper, but be preapred to negotiate and interpret with your opponent!

After 1 game, and I'm not sure I'll play it again. It looks awesome and is a typical FFG product with quality plastic and 3D landscape. But the gameplay seems a bit tedious. First of all, it is quite repetitive although I acknowledge the smartness of the initiative track. But especially combats seem to copy themselves after a few encounters. And I have my doubts of the replayability given the fixed map.

All in all, I would always prefer other 2-player wargames over this, but still... it looks awesome.

Updated commentary (see below if you really want to see what I originally thought).

I have indeed improved my rating of this game by a good margin. I love it! I wasn't sure for a long time, but I purchased this game as I was just beginning to get into hobby boardgaming. Now that I am more familiar with a lot of mechanics in general, this game flowed extremely well the last time I played. It is actually a lot less fiddly than I originally thought, and the last game I played was very exciting (it boiled down to one battle...the winner of that battle won the game. It was really tight all the way through). 

Original opinion:
I may improve my rating with more plays. However, the times I have tried to play this game it really just seems to get bogged down. Setup takes a good deal of time, and the rules aren't particularly intuitive. I suppose that to me this game lacks a feeling of flow. I am still holding out hope that something will click and I will find that flow, but for now, it just seems clunky.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I love the setting. I love the depth of the game. I love the theme and how great it depicts the novel. I'm not sure about the card combat system, but the game is very elegant over all. I like it a lot, but its playing and setup time makes it hard for it to hit the table oftenly. I say it's availbale for trading, but most of the times I do not know if I'd really let go of it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a really good implementation of Fantasy Flight game mechanics into a 2 player environment. It has pieces of Twilight Imperium, Chaos in the Old World and Rex all streamlined nicely for 2 players. The game setup time is a bit long for the payoff, but there are a lot of interesting choices to make and just the right amount of randomness (meaning, not too much randomness) as the game is pleasingly diceless.
I don't care much for the story, as I'm not invested in the whole Warhammer thing. The components are pretty cool looking through, and I like how the strength of the units is immediately discernible by the base of the mini.

Probably a great card driven wargame, but in the beginning it is daunting to set up, and difficult to get all the rules down.  I still want to play a few games with more knowledgeable people, until I get it down pat.

Gonna start this one out at an 8. Combat system is excellent. Order and initiative track are very fun to play with. The theme flows out of the game while playing and you feel as though you are sucked right into what is happening.

The mostly static board setup and scenario play keep this one from being a long term keeper. It was fun for the times I did play it, though.

The length of the game makes this a 6 at the moment for me.  I enjoy the game, but will play it if in the right mood.  The order/initiative trade off is quite interesting.  As well as the timing of the refresh orders and learning how to pace the attack.  Perhaps with additional plays these will start to seem too constraining and scripted, but not just yet.  

The rules are not that complex or complicated at all.  Some of the fortifications are too small for the stacking limit of units in them especially once the hero and laser is added.  But this clutter didn't detract from the playing at all.  Combat is battle cards and pretty straight forward.  With small decks - will get familiar with the cards pretty quickly which will speed up the game as key patterns are learnt.

Where to start describing this beast of a game. I normally write short rules overviews, but that's not REALLY possible here.

HH is a two player game in which one side defends against attack (Imp), while the other player (Horus) attacks. There are multiple ways to win. Kill the Emperor or Horus, for horus to have all 4 space ports or for the Emperor to survive long enough till all his troops return. 

In HH, you play cards face down to indicate orders. There is a map, which allows you to programm cards for reduced costs or you play cards directly for higher costs. Everything you do is a trade-off on the initiative track. The more initative you spend, the more actions your opponent can do before it syour turn again as the player with the least amount of initative spent gets to perform actions.

I like Horus Heresy. It's big, epic and spawling. I do feel it's incredibly thematic. I sadly feel the game is not really for me. I feel that to get the biggest kick from it, you have to love the 40k verse. If you like long 2p games and Warhammer, HH is a mustbuy. For me, I think I'd rather play a 2p fantasy wargame.. like War of the Ring of Battle of Five Armies than this one.

--Jun2010-- Interesting but imperfectly compelling battle game.  In my opinion the best part is the battle mechanics;  the card selection and play dynamics are really quite cool.  The worst part, for me, is the 40K background: the game presumes that _of course_ you know which colour the Tzeentch forces are, or how one might visually differentiate 6mm tall Cultists from a Warband.  

The damage chits are second worst.  They're really fiddly, and not anywhere near as functional as they should be.  If a piece gets damaged, surely I just want to add (or remove) some characteristic from that mini.  Wanting to swap a 1-value damage chit for a 2-value one is not the best usability decision.

The sizes of things, too, is understandable but bizarre.  The fliers are relatively small, but can transport Titans four times their size.  The smallest minis are so tiny as to be almost indistinguishable from one another, but - because of their entirely useful bases - only barely fit at full capacity in the spaces reserved for them.  The leaders are lovely large-ish cardboard standups - but other than reducing the pricepoint - there's no reason that the game wouldn't be at least as playable if all the units were cardboard standups.  As the game passed, I found myself variably wishing that the minis were larger (necessarily requiring a spectacularly huge board, which might not work) or that the minis were smaller (which would make them much harder to work with, but leave the board a bit less like an irregular pile of off-kilter plastic.

But that's perhaps too much ranting about the physical item.  Is the game interesting?  Sure.  But I'd've been just as happy playing a version with a flat mapboard and cardboard chits that could have been published 30 years ago.

I held off trying this game for a while because why do I need sooooo much stuff for a 2-player game whose theme I'm ambivalent about?

It provides the quintessential FFG experience for 2 players. Several elements are reminiscent of Starcraft, like the order stack, the combat cards (bonus if matching unit), and the ton of unintuitive unit and hero abilities -- e.g. the Space Marines -- to memorize (which I don't like as much). Worth the price of admission to check out the initiative track (first implementation of the time track mechanism for 2 players that I know of), and nifty strategy-map implementation to reward long-term planning.

Great siege mentality with the besieger and besieged switching roles depending on who's ahead.

Combat cards aren't perfect, since they can slow the game down (especially with people who care too much, or people who card-count), and there's no way to plan attacks astutely short of card-counting (since you don't maintain a hand), plus it gets fiddly with large battles, but it's cool to resolve battles in a non-traditional way.

Ive played this game a few times now since it first came out, and I must say I really enjoy it. 

Very good 2 player head to head action. The fact that the game is different everytime you start is another good thing (traitors) which I really like.

And it can be played solo with out to much effort or loss of effect/feeling of the game.

A GW classic remade with vastly improved looks. For it's 100 euro price tag there is way too little content in the huge box. Everything could (again) fit in a considerably smaller box. The figures are ok, although the imperial titan scultp fails miserably in portraying it's subject. Some of the other figures look way too much like each other, worst are chaos cultists & warbands. This makes no sense and feels like cutting corners to save some money (in the wrong place). As I said you'd expect higher quality for 100 euros. Still it is a fairly nice looking game, so nothing that's actually a deal breaker (especially if you got it as a gift like me).
The plastic 3d terrain pieces looks pretty good, but actually make positioning the units harder so I personally will not be using them.

The rules seem complex after the first read and there are many small details to remember. Ultimately it is more on the simple side for a wargame. I actually have no qualms about the game system and there seems to be enough interesting options how to pursue a victory. As an old follower of the 40k universe I feel the game captures it's theme fairly succesfully.

The one solo play I had of this didn't quite cut it for me. The story wasn't capturing me notwithstanding all the chrome. Should give it another go but I'm somehow reluctant to do so...
...did it, opposed, and wow: the story of a great, epic confrontation came to life, embellished by a number of clever, distinctive mechanics. Outstanding game, not suitable for soloing, given the dominance of card playing mechanics (no dice at all in this one) that has been a trademark of FFG in those years.

Initial impressions rating. Interesting and unique skirmish. I like the combat system, but so far in newbie plays we've failed to take advantage of the lush board and options presented us, and instead end up focusing our efforts on one region of the map and time running out before we really get to use everything the gmae has to offer. I imagine with experience I'll discover better gameplans for both sides that lead to a more fleshed-out and interesting war

[hr]Man, I barely even remember how to play this game, but pretty sure the combat system in Forbidden Stars is better. Actually, Forbidden Stars represents a few other good ideas from Horus Heresy, like orders and bombardment.

This game was innovative, but annoying and complex enough to learn and play that it really, really dampens my desire to actually play it. Rating lowered.

This game is near perfect. A Jewel of Strategy games.

That is all to say, 

but for the ones who want more information:

amazing Strategic Decisionmaking System (card PLacement).
amazing Combat system (Card drawing).
Long-term decisionmaking and recoursing ones and opponents action. (Thinking about ones gameplan like a chess-player)
Important army composition.
Long learning curve (small slope)

I like how u want to do dozens of actions but are restricted to just 1 or 2 sometimes. It feels so hard to decide, but that is what war is about. 
A Must-Have for fans of 2-Player Games. (make sure u are not too dumb for this game :-)

Asymmetrical wargame where one player takes the forces of the Imperium of Man, the other the forces of Chaos under the treacherous Warmaster Horus. Though it shares the name with an early Games Workshop wargame, it was redeveloped to the point that it is almost completely unrecognizable.

I was so excited about this game -- the first Fantasy Flight experience in a while that I had allowed myself to be optimistic about. I read the rulebook and, on paper, it's intriguing. There are multiple win-conditions: the deaths of Horus or the Emperor are instant wins. The Chaos player can also win by controlling all four spaceports; the Imperium (in most scenarios) wins by default if too many turns elapse. Combat involves no dice, but "iterations" of card play using multipurpose cards (damage, shields, two kinds of special effect). Turn order and actions are based on command cards and an initiative track: expensive actions (like "build a Titan") cost more "time" than a simple movement order. The "strategic map" plays into these by allowing to execute orders at a lower cost by delaying them until later turns and choosing their geographical area ahead of time, creating many agonizing decisions around timing.

I even thought that FFG's penchant for excessive overproduction had been dampened by sanity: sure, it's a huge box with a kilo of plastic in it, but the single bombardment deck serves as a source of randomness for about five different kinds of effect. It would be more in keeping with FFG traditions to include three decks and two custom dice.

But I was [i]led astray[/i]. Perhaps the worst thing is that I can still see how everything I thought I would enjoy could really work -- it's just buried under all the random crap.

If the units can survive the random events, the random orbital bombardments, the random defense lasers and the random traitors, they might finally get into combat, the most disappointing aspect of all. The fact that combat cards are often unusable (because of unit requirements and so on) reduces choices, and that these cards are drawn randomly at the start of each battle inhibits composing forces specifically to take advantage of particular cards. It's halfway to a deep, fascinating system, but only halfway. I would kill for A Few Acres of Snow's sieges.

The introductory scenarios are problematic because the Imperium needs only to delay: there is generally little incentive to manoeuvre out of fortified positions, which give huge combat advantages. The result is a longer game of tedious delaying tactics that inhibits use of the strategic map. (Speaking of which: why are your own cards on the strategic map to be face down!?)

There are good points: the rules are repetitive but generally clear; the time track guarantees a fairly quick game; the production is extremely lavish; and all those swingy cards could, in the right mindset, tell an exciting story. If you're looking for a light wargame and like the theme, you could do a lot worse.

It's just not for me. I thought it would be about deep strategy; it turned out to be beer-and-pretzels.

Prima ancora che la fosca oscurità del 41° millennio divenisse realtà vi era un tempo di miti e leggende, dove esseri quasi divini si affrontarono in una battaglia epica, che portò il fratello contro il proprio fratello.

Permettiate che vi riportiamo al 31° millennio, quando un’età dell’oro fu distrutta dal tradimento, e degenerò nella più grande battaglia di tutti i tempi.

Benvenuti in Horus Heresy, un gioco da tavolo epico per due giocatori ambientato nel fosco futuro dell’universo di Warhammer 40,000, la principale ambientazione della Games Workshop.

Uno dei giocatori assumerà il ruolo del Dio Imperatore di Sacra Terra e resisterà come l’ultimo bastione di speranza per il futuro del Genere Umano. L’altro giocatore assumerà le vesti del Signore della Guerra Horus, un tempo il più amato e fidato dei suoi discendenti, ora senza più speranza di redenzione e sanità mentale, trasformato e reso irriconoscibile dal tocco insidioso del Caos.

Entrambi i giocatori comanderanno le loro vaste legioni in battaglie sanguinarie sulla superficie sconvolta della Terra, luogo di origine del Genere Umano. Riuscirà Horus nella sua missione profana di schiacciare l’Imperium, annegando la galassia nel flusso del Caos e della distruzione, o riuscirà il determinato Sacro Imperatore dell’Umanità a rompere il sanguinoso assedio, passando all’attacco contro le crudeli macchinazioni dei Poteri Perniciosi del Warp?

This is fundamentally a two-player card-driven war game.  If the production and aesthetics were changed, this wouldn't feel that out of place from GMT rather than from Fantasy Flight.  There's a need to defend in some places, attack in others, and it can rapidly change from one to the other within a turn.  There's also an interesting desire to set up a sequence of punishing actions in one place, but it is relatively difficult to pull off, as your opponent can do a lot of interruption to make that impossible.

Unlike FFG's usual effort, the components here are not that great.  The order cards should probably be large, and the combat cards small, but they are the other way around.  The  plastic fortification pieces on the board look nice, but they are way too small to support all the pieces they are supposed to, and they make it awkward to place breach tokens between zones.

There are some mechanisms that are just plain more trouble than they're worth, such as the turn order initiative track and the strategic order board.  I like the combat system in this game quite a bit, but it feels like there's a huge amount of extra stuff to get through in order to do the fun stuff.

All in all, it is a real mishmash, and not a game I'd ever see pulling out from among many other better two-player wargames.  Unless the theme grabs you, opt for something else.

This is a great 2-player game. If you are into the 40K story this is defenetly a must play game. 

This is heavy in theme and the combat mechanism is a true gem as it escalates the combat as it progresses through several iterations. 

The only thing that prevents me from giving it a ten is that the areas of the board are just a bit too small and the figures and cardboard markers that battle for the space end up making it difficult to quickly access the information you need.

Horus Heresy is a board game that pits two players against each other to recreate the most famous battle of Warhammer 40,000’s rich history, in which the Warmaster Horus’s betrayal of the Emperor comes to its climax. Taking the side of either traitor or loyalist, players control a fearsome array of units, including the Emperor and Horus themselves. Brother fights brother, and the universe hangs in the balance!
\13\\13\
Horus Heresy includes six scenarios that differ in both difficulty and style. The first scenario, titled Brother Against Brother, is recommended for all new players as it provides predetermined starting locations for both player's forces. It is a well balanced version of the Battle for Terra, and also presents a roughly historical recreation of the conflict's events.
\13\\13\
Taking the side of traitor or loyalist, two players control either fearless Space Marine legions or deviant Chaos Space Marines, mighty Titans, Imperial Armies both loyal and traitorous, and a fearsome array of other units, including the Emperor and Horus themselves.
\13\\13\
An innovative order and initiative system forces each side to carefully consider the commands they issue to their troops. A dramatic, card-driven combat system incorporates escalating damage, gives players the opportunity to allocate resources between attack and defense, and brings to bear the unique special powers of each unit type, from fortification-destroying Titans to the perverse daemons of Chaos.

OK, here's the scoop...I loved the original GW version of Horus Heresy from way back in '93 and I couldn't wait for this one to come out.  Just got it today and BOY AM I DISAPPOINTED!!!  The production value for this big box game from FF is nothing short of ABSOLUTE RIP OFF!!!  $99 for this piece of crap?!?  I can't believe I'm writing this about a FF game, but anyone who pays full price for this game is getting less of a game if it were packaged in one of their half-big box games (ala Android or Arkham Horror)!!!  The actual quantity and quality of pieces is far, far less than one would expect from a FF big box game.  Tide of Iron is vastly superior in detail and size compared to these tiny, low detail playing pieces AND COSTS LESS BRAND NEW.  The buildings are ultra-thin vacuum formed with painted on details.  If one of these buildings doesn't RIP in the next play session, I will be very surprised.  The majority of the cards are the small European style cards (which I ALWAYS HATE!) and don't even total up to the number of cards you would get in an Arkham Horror small box expansion.  Granted there are some larger cards, but they are few.  The ONLY redeeming quality of the game is that it has 40K flavor (I know, it's really 30K) and plays pretty smoothly.  Strategy is important, but it mostly boils down to having the right cards to make the right plays. One other point that makes this slightly better is that there are different scenarios you can play, not just the all-out brawl that was in the original version.  I haven't played them all, but I am hoping that they might help redeem my utter disappointment in waiting and spending the money on something that could have been packaged in a half-big box and cost even half as much.  OK, let the flaming on me begin!

Scratches my 40K itch.  The game's central mechanic - Initiative as a timer, a turn indicator, a victory condition, and a resource - works beautifully, and each side feels the pressure as the Traitor player works his way in to the heart of Terra.  My lone quibbles: physical scale, production value, and movement.  The board should be bigger, the fortresses should be bigger.  For a game this pricey, the heroes should be minis and the plastic used for the board should be of better quality.  Beyond that, I wish I had a wee bit more freedom to move pieces on the board.  But this is an enjoyable game, and worth the time to play.

[b]AT LAST - A GAME-BOX I CAN BE BURIED IN![/b]

Upon more exposure to Horus Heresy, my rating may become more traitorous; I very much doubt that it will move closer to his Imperial Majesty.

Firstly, let me calm your fears: I am not a GW fanboy or even a huge fan of the 40K universe. You can trust my distilled thoughts to be merely the musings of a dedicated gamer, who happened to be attracted to this particular 40K game. Much like when I was drawn to the original Space Hulk, I loved that game [i]despite[/i] its Rogue Trader heritage. HH may prove to be kinda of in the same league.

I feel that this is the way the 40K mythology should be handled. A serious, well considered design, inspired by the canonical events depicted in countless GW Black Library books - but not a slavish re-enactment - bundled with a shitload of plastic.

[b]THE EMPORER:[/b]

1. Brilliant theme.
2. Climatic struggle experience. [i]"The Imperium was bathed in flames as the bitter civil war enveloped the stars, but it was on Holy Terra that the fate of the Galaxy would be decided."[/i] Doesn't that grab you? We're not growing cabbages here all evening, my friend. When I bring this game to your house, we're going to decide the fate of the fucking Galaxy this very night!
3. Opening the coffin-sized box, and spying all the oodles of plastic titans, tanks, and space marines, brings to mind the good old days of Ameritrash legends such as Axis & Allies and Fortress America.
4. A mountain of plastic soldiers and Imperial tanks.
5. No dice. The combat system uses an escalating card-driven structure. I happen to like it, even though I'm a massive dice-whore, and am not entirely keen on the current trend of diceless combat. After drawing most of the cards, streaks like you'd suffer through bad dice results are eliminated - the results are more predictable with a small deck of cards, than a tossed die. The mechanisms involved force you to make interesting decisions in each iteration of combat: should I discard cards to "shield" against this hit or special power, or save them to lob an inferno of firepower back on my active phase.
6. Deep background to the game, rather than a paragraph of fluff.
7. You get to command 100-foot high Titans (read Mechs, Amp suits, Robots, Mecha-Godzila). The game also has massive laser defense batteries for vaporising incoming dropships. Say that three times fast.
8. This wargame actually rewards strategic play; a rarity in designer games. By laying down orders for future turns, you could be saving yourself those precious initiative points, and gaining a strategic special bonus to boot. There is a helluva lot happening on that strategic map, with players jockeying for topmost order position. Possibly it's my favourite aspect of HH.
9. The unit bases are a well thought out device, relaying damage, affiliation and or faction, and rank at a moment's glance. Good stuff.
10. Cool board. Not too big, but big enough. And, it has holes cut through it for you to insert some natty industrial complexes, fortresses, or the Imperial palace.
11. Great graphic design throughout. I particularly like the Traitor's mega-ship, cruising in a geostationary orbit at the side of the main board.
12. Different scenarios can be played. I believe the starter mission could keep you busy for months, and the others are slight variations on this - mainly allowing for experienced player latitude in placing initial units.
13. Smart event deck that feels like a diet Twilight Struggle, with its early, mid, and late war periods (act I,II, and III).
14. Fantastic initiative track, that governs what happens, phase-wise, and when. Reminds me loosely of Thebes. Clever designers sometimes "borrow" the cooler game mechanisms from neat Euro-trash games, and bolt them onto Ameritrash uber-games. Smashing. Not saying that happened here, BTW, just coincidence. Maybe. Anyhow, you end up with a unique-feeling meld, sometimes.
15. Variable paths to victory. This is important to me, as I believe it gives the game longevity, and increases my desire to heave the weighty box out of the closet once again.
16. Heroic action has a massive impact on play, permitting titanic conflicts to play out in an action movie like way. Whatever you do, make sure you know what your heroes can do, and especially what the enemy is capable of. Ignoring Thorgrim's traitor-making power could be very costly for you - it was for me, attacking him with 6 units of tanks and a couple of Imperial Armies. After he'd done converting them to his traitorous cause, my assault was over before it even started!
17. Gameplay post-mortems and session reports sound like the pitches to a new James Cameron mega-movie. This is a good thing.
18. I can count on one gauntleted hand, the amount of games where I want to spend time reading the backstory (maybe even buying a book on the subject). This is one such case. I enjoy Runebound a good deal, but I wouldn't spend any time whatsoever reading about the dull land that that game's set in. While we're on the subject of Runebound, why, oh sweet Jesus, do they keep setting new games in that colourless kingdom? I'm yapping on about Dungeonquest, for those that care.
19. Orbital bombardments. And the Traitor has two flavours of death-from-above: pinpoint and reckless. [i]"The skies of Earth were black with dust and ash thrown up by the barrage. The land was split with gigantic fissures and the tectonic plates groaned with stress."[/i]
20. Doesn't take as long to play as you might expect. Our first game, after a lousy rules explanation by me, took 90-odd minutes (with only 1 rule played wrong: the Traitor can use his Drop Pods placed on the strategy map on the 1st turn. Doh!).

[b]THE WARMASTER HORUS:[/b]

1. Missing plastic components. Well, there was from my box, and after buying a £70 game, I was pretty pissed, I can tell you.
2. No dice. Whether this point goes against the grain, depends on your current leaning.
3. Takes a couple of read-throughs of the rules to fully download all the finer points into your brain. A good friend of mine told me that the rules were shit - I disagree. They are well written, I'd say, with good examples, and also a new piece of phrasing I haven't seen regularly elsewhere: "To be clear, do XYZ" So, after explaining the rules and an example, they make an extra effort to reiterate their meaning. Well done, FFG. Having said that, more examples would have been nice in about 3-4 places. After reading some sections 3-odd times, I still didn't quite get some of the sharper points. I should know, writing rules to a game is HARD work, and should never be done fully by the designer. These are generally a very good example of how to do it for a complicated game.
4. Takes at least an hour or so to baggie up all the game-bits, punch all the functional multicoloured counters, and conjoin the unit miniatures to their respective bases.
5. Steeeeeep price point. My theory is that after paying GW a cut for their intellectual property, you need to raise the game's price to make a tidy profit. The difficult design/marketing decision is thus: make HH a space opera game unshackled to any other folk's property and sell some copies, but make more profit per unit; or, sell the game branded to GW IP and sell huge numbers, but have to pay the ferryman. It's a tough call. A great friend of mine believes that you should always push your own IP, but I'm unconvinced. I know that it's usually more interesting to create a game based on the world created by another - then you can put all your efforts into the game, and not focus on the gameworld. Plus, if clever men only ever made things based on their own universes, we wouldn't have Cameron's Aliens movie, or this game, for that matter.
6. Only 2 players.
7. Making decisions on which command cards to play and where, can stall the game if you're prone to analysing every option.
8. You will have difficulty in placing all the figures you need to within the Imperial palace confines - I put this down to the trickiness of getting everything "just right" within the bounds of producing such a complicated multi-piece game. Nigh nearly impossible, I suspect.
9. Some folks won't like the smaller decks of cards. I can't complain about them here, but I did not like them in Arkham Horror.
10. Where's Ka'bandha, greater daemon (Balrog) of Khorne? Missing from this game but not forgotten.
11. Initally daunting. What with the complex-sounding rules and buckets of bits to set up.
12. Less combat than you'd expect. Well, much less than I expected. I think I was imagining Axis & Allies in space. Not saying that's it's a negative - just mentioning it as a thought. There's so much thinking and maneuvring to be done. Feigns and such to do, you know. What you do end up doing with your time is a good deal of fun, however.
13. I would have loved a small section of the board depicting the Space Marine factions and their symbols. To those players who have no idea whatsoever who the White Scars or Blood Angels are, this would have been a godsend.
14. Massive box. And I mean MASSIVE. I guess it's a merchandising decision, because if a bricks & mortar store put this on the shelf, there isn't any space for any other bloody thing! The box is bigger than the contents would suggest.
15. Fiddly. And I don't just mean balancing the models in the Imperial palace - I mean the rules. There's a job-lot of things to remember to do. This game's high maintenance, without a doubt in my mind.

Nice board, nice minis, but gameplay was a bit so-so.  Lots of sitting around unable to move because you don't have the right card.  Several of the cards could use some clarification.  Combat is fun though.

After watching the review of the game on DowntimeTown, I have to say that this is kind of game that I would like to own just for the sake of owning it. Artwork and the board looked awesome! And to own a game that depicts the events that sphaped the whole 40k universe.. I'm speechless.

This is all the Warhammer 40k I think I will ever need or want (Or not. See: Forbidden Stars). It's a pretty substantial meal. Que up some Bolt Thrower and have fun.

Last of the mighty "coffin boxes" holding out in my game-cupboard. A grim & grizzled beast that seemingly leaves a rusty bloodstain on every shelf. The last of a dying breed (only TI3 remains on the Chinese production lines...). It is a wargame, but an odd kind of wargame put out at the culmination of Fantasy Flight no-dice cantankerousness. A bitter, clunky, attritional, stubbornly obtuse wargame full of absurd production choices. The miniatures are tiny, and yet still too big to fit in some of the mapboard spaces, especially the ridiculous (and glorious) "3D" vaccu-form inserts. An odd game on an obscure subject that might manage to piss off both 40k miniature wargamers and people looking for a bit of "Ameritrash". Overpriced and underrated.

This has many little problems, but they don't keep it from being an extraordinarily smooth and well conceived game with a wealth of option that other games may yearn for, but will never reach. Good!

Lots of sizzle with very little steak.

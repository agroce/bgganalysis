So far I played only Inventions. Well, gameplay itself is identical, but cards are different, as expected. However I rate this one lower, because some cards are not 100% clear, ambiguous. For example Neanderthals theory vs modern Neanderthals theory - no clue what they refer to. What is more, the set contains cards from other themes as well (like Events or Inventions), so when you see a "Sphinx" card, you don't know whether they mean when it was built or excavated (discovered). 
Another ambiguous example would be an idea of an "atom" - it turns out that they refer to ancient philosophy instead of actual observance. 
Finally, too many cards deal with discovering America - when was Brazil discovered, then Mexico, Peru, Newfoundland, potatoes, cocoa etc. - or more or less the same.
In other words, some cards require more text on them in order to be precise, and some are obsolete, because they refer to the same timeframes too often. I will remove some cards for my plays.

Excellent! party game of choice :) simple idea that works well. I wish for a more strategic game though, with more choices, e.g. special cards that let you draft out certain discoveries, or give you 2 placement chances, e.t.c.

Like any other title in the Timeline series, «Discoveries» and the events it includes (although mostly from the last five hundred years and especially the last two centuries) are a fast and moderately fun way to show your friends your ignorance on several subjects: I’m unsure whether it still can be considered a game or an idle pastime, anyhow it’s fun to see your friends struggle with even the most basic historical events or dates and miserably fail.

That is one of the rare moments in today’s barbaric age when you can openly take pride in your (usually scorned) Humanities background and crush your opponents, see them driven before you and hear their womanly lamentations.

Covers -6000 to 1996.  The deck is mostly concentrated around 1450-1950, with a surprising dearth of 18th century events which splits them into two distinct groups.  Less than 13% before 1480, and very little after 1950.  Deck midpoint is 1821.  

The cards are slightly larger than other sets, and have a different textbox frame.  Also the only set that doesn't have a uniform color in the year box.  Five different colors are used, though 80% are the same yellow/orange color.

It's basically a trivia game. But you don't have to know the exact date - a rough estimate can sometimes be enough.

Definately the hard timeline.  And honestly, it's hard for stupid reasons.  Do we really need a card for every evolutionary skeleton of man (neanderthal and cro-magnon I get, but the other 8?  Why?)

If you are buying the sets, make sure this one is last, unless you want to make the game brutal (this version requires a love of history & a college/A.P. education).  That said I still enjoy it.

Good game to play sporadically with my non-gaming family members and friends.  Proved to be a hit for Christmas 2015 and 2016.  

We play with 6 sets mixed in together (Discoveries, Diversity/General Interest, Historical Events, Inventions, Music & Cinema and British History) and even then you start getting the same cards again fairly quickly.  However, none of us have particularly good memories so it doesn't matter too much!  If you're playing with people who have good memories then I'd recommend mixing at least 2-3 sets together.

Players take turns to add one of their invention cards to the timeline - a row of inventions, along with their associated date, in the centre of the board. The played card is then flipped to reveal its date, and if correct its added to the timeline.  If incorrect, it's discarded from the game and replaced with another card from the deck. Object is the first to play all their cards correctly into the timeline.  Brilliantly executed, yet very simple game. Quite subtle too, as you try to get the coarse guesses out there early, while the timeline is more forgiving.  As it lengthens, the gaps get narrower and the game becomes much more difficult.  Designed with expansions in mind, which are a must, but they buck the trend of most expansions and will only improve the game by diluting the card mix to prevent memorization.  

This was my second set, and instantly mixing them into the original "Inventions" set vastly improved them game.  The level of difficulty quickly ramped up, and freshened up a slightly stale game.

Timeline is a clever little party game that works well with almost any group. Be sure to reduce the number of cards each player starts with the more players you have involved though so it doesn't overstay its welcome.

One of the things that Wits and Wagers did so well was having trivia where you didn't need to know the exact answer, just be closest without going over. Similarly, the Timeline games simply ask you know if something occurred within a range of times. This is the way that trivia really needs to work to be fun. Simply "do you know it or not" is too binary to work well with various knowledge levels. There are minor replayability issues as players learn all the cards, but there are many versions of Timeline to keep this from becoming a real problem. 

Definitely worth playing and owning a version or two.

Trivia games are not games, they are [url=http://www.human-memory.net/types_declarative.html]non-interactive skill[/url]  contests, played on an uneven field, which are fun for equally matched players/teams, but usually devolve into which team gets lobbed more softball questions in their weakest category, à la Trival Pursuit.

Timeline is a solid filler game that's quick to learn and fun to play. There are some balance issues (some cards are harder to place than others). There is also some danger in limiting replay value by memorizing the dates of events, using multiple Timeline sets helps alleviate this... and besides, learning the dates is a good thing... it's educational!

The Discoveries edition is a solid addition to the series. There are plenty of noteworthy events that will help increase the spread of the game's events - though don't be surprised if it causes running jokes about how everything was discovered by Europeans.

A nice party game, extremely simple to teach and fun for everyone. It sidesteps the usual problem of trivia games, which that they are often too easy or too difficult. Since you place your card in the timeline, you can use your intuition or vague memories. 

One big flaw is the very low replayability. There are only a hundred or so cards in a set, and you quickly go through them and learn them. I have no doubt the game would really shine with a much bigger pool of cards, especially of different themes. But each box is pretty costly, and overpriced already, so getting 2-3 of them just as a starter is not very enticing.

Initial Rating: 8.0 (October 2012)

I love Timeline. It has a short time play and it has been a success whenever I bring it to the table. It can play well with 3-8 players. This expansion gives new life to the series as it prevents you to get too familiar with so many cards. 

On the bad side I counted 5 repeated cards that came in Discoveries AND in Historical Events. I’m not sure if this is because I have the French Edition of Historical events and the English edition of Discoveries.  Also as I always count the cards after play, now I have to count 219 cards which is a little cumbersome.

I will continue to buy expansions as soon as they show up :D.

RATING: 5
Fun, little non-gamer time killer. Great if you have the right group of newcomers. However, doesn't have a strong shelf life.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Put the cards depicting various items you have into the right spots on the developing time line based on their discovery: if it's right, it stays and grows the line; if it's wrong, you get another card. Winner is the one who clears them all out. That's all the instruction you need -- but you will be getting taught by the game as to a bunch of dates you did not know. It's fun, educational, quick and easy to learn. The only downside is that you'll eventually know the cards and have to mix in other sets.

BIG PLUS: inexpensive, fun & educational - with strong involvement by all players!
BIG MINUS: size of the cards

Discovery probably not as good as historical events. e.g. knowing insulin is discovered around 1907 is not as important as know what it is. To that end, knowing WWII starts in 1939 probably more helpful than when insulin was discovered.

Timeline: Discoveries is a card game played using 109 cards. Each card depicts an discovery on both sides, with the year in which that discovery occurred on only one side. Players take turns placing a card from their hand in a row on the table. After placing the card, the player reveals the date on it. If the card was placed correctly with the date in chronological order with all other cards on the table, the card stays in place; otherwise the card is removed from play and the player takes another card from the deck.

A more appropriate name for the game would be Timeline: When Europe Got Round to Finding Out About Stuff.  A very Eurocentric game which suffers from the curse of all Timeline versions (ambiguity over a minority of cards - we have a house rule that says if the date is not clear ... do they mean built or excavation ... it can be returned to the pack and replaced).  However, even with these negatives it remains a great game and easy to mix with other expansions.  Highly recommended but if you were to get one pack I would recommend Inventions first.

Simple game with an event on one side an a date on the other.  You are dealt five cards and players take turns trying to put them in the correct location in the timeline.  It gets harder later in the game as you add to the timeline.  If you make a mistake you take another card.  

Fast, simple filler game that teaches you some dates in history.

This is a very light game of trying to place key dates within the chronology of an ever growing timeline. 

It is a game but is heavily knowledge based and over-familiarity can reduce the fun to be had and competitive nature of the game.

Production wise the games in the series are just gorgeous to look at and many a collector will buy them for that reason alone. 

This is something very differnet for a person's collection and is also perfect for families and school's as an educational resource.

The series is also great for dinner parties as conversation starters.

Timeline is a great game for those moments where you just want to play a quick game, without having to learn rules. The mechanic is brilliantly simple - stick events on to the timeline. If you're right, great. If not, less great. What I quite like is that when you flip the card to reveal the answer, it gives you the date and the name of the person they're crediting with the invention/event - so geeks like me get their extra reading sorted. It's also quite fun to try and talk through your answers, and some of them really will surprise you. The biggest flaw of the game is replayability. It's not huge; once you've played a few times and learnt the dates, you get better and better. It does take a while for this to happen though. This is why there are so many variations of the game (Sports, Inventions, Discoveries, Star Wars... etc.). Add two points to the rating if you're a history buff.

Simple yet elegant trivia game. Select a card from your hand and place it relative to a timeline of discoveries. Correct placement adds to the timeline, incorrect it is discarded and you need to draw a new card. 
First one to play all their cards wins. 
As the game progresses the timeline gets more dense and you must be more exact in placing in your year estimate. The subtle strategy is to play the cards you are less certain about when the timeline is more forgiving. To keep the game fresh it will need expansions to have fresh cards in the deck.

Good with 2-6.  Anymore than that and the timeline gets so granular that only a "wiz" can win and the rest of the people will just clutter things.

This is a good filler game to play for 10-15 minutes while everyone settles at the table for a bigger game.

The only problem I've seen is that people who've played before may have an advantage because they'll remember approximate (or exact) dates.  I haven't run into this yet...but it's coming.

The fun of this game comes from interacting with the other players and basically realizing you don't remember anything from history class.  Don't play it with someone just out of high school, they cheat.

--Feb2013-- It's cute.  And rather than complaining, I find myself appreciating the discipline that specifies the discoverer as well as the discovery.  (I might quibble a tiny bit about the discovery of North America:  as a Canadian, the [i]L'Anse aux Meadows[/i] site seems pretty definitive, yet the card wanted Columbus.)

Basically the same as Anno Domini, with the same limited topic in a set. This one has only one third of the cards though, albeit prettier cards. To make a decent game of it you need to mix the other topics of Timeline into the one game - which makes it a pricey game - or buy the 220 card mixed version.

Can be a fun game with the right group of players. Very simple to explain and get up and running - you're placing cards based upon their chronological order, trying to get rid of your hand. As the timeline grows it becomes increasingly harder to find the right gap for cards you have remaining. I enjoy it with family, but my rating is based upon my feeling of its general reception with gamers and how I feel about playing with them. Certainly the topic specific deck drags the rating down on this one as a stand alone game.

[Asmodee 13 edition] {Education; shedding; optimal 3-4p} This is a fun game for children to learn about science discovery.  Good to play with a computer ready to explain the terms to children.  Replayability can be limited though.

The choice of the cards is appropriate but they can include more discoveries from Egyptian, Asian or middle-east countries.

The cards can be larger for the children to see, especially, the children need not take cards into their hands.

All of the Timeline series have the same premise:
Play the cards to the table so that the card you're playing fits in chronological order. If you can do that then the card remains in play. If not then it's discarded and you draw a new card.
The game makes an excellent learning tool for children.
The downside to this particular set is that several of the discovery's dates are open to debate and often it is unclear if the dates are for discoveries or for when they were built. It's not so bad when playing just this set, but when mixed with others it ramps up the challenge.

Update: Actually, the science set might be too difficult. Whereas the other sets seem to be playable with 'everyday knowledge' this one seems to require some very specific knowledge.

I wish the cards had more facts about the event (or whatever) than just the date, but if you take it a step further on your own this can be a rewarding casual family game.

A quick, simple, and very good filler trivia game. We played with both Timeline: Discoveries and Timeline: Historical Events (keeping them separate), and everyone liked Historical Events a little better. I imagine they'll all get mixed together eventually.

Culled - First wave; Gifted to Steve

Why we culled it: Timeline is awesome, regardless of the topical focus of a given set. It encourages historical trivia without directly punishing you for a less-than-eidetic memory. Players have a hand of cards listing a significant event. They cannot see the date of that event, which is printed on the reverse. A timeline forms on the table, in which players must insert a card from their hand into the appropriate place on the timeline. It begins very easy, but the guesswork becomes more and more difficult as the dates fill in and players have smaller windows to target. It is a lot of fun. It does, however, play a bit unfairly between people with extensive historical trivia and those who do not, particularly in the later game (knowing the exact year of an event means you should hold those cards for when precision becomes necessary). In the end, we really enjoy it, but rarely find a place for it in our rotation, so we decided to find it a better home.

The goal of Timeline is to place a set of cards depicting import discoveries (discovery of Peru by Europeans, antibiotics, et al) in chronological order.  There are enough cards that memorizing the entire deck will be a challenge, though many cards can be deduced by just a little bit of logic (Europeans sailed from the east so Brazil would have been discovered before Peru).

It is a fun and fast filler game that essentially replaces something like Trivial Pursuit, but as a warmup.  Every game has had at least one loud "Nooooo, really ?" and a good laugh.

Most cards are "discovered by Europeans", which can be extremely frustrating to those who know their history. What's worse is that it's not consistent about which Europeans; sometimes it includes the Vikings and sometimes it excludes them.

Great travel game.  Takes up little space, plays fast, rewards trivial knowledge and a good liberal arts education (but I repeat myself) in about equal measures.  Gets better when combined with other Timeline sets.

This is more of a trivia game, and thus players will be wildly unbalanced with respect to each other. I know a lot of things, but I still get some dates wrong, so it's fun for a while.

The game has the same mechanism as Inventions, and adds a little life to the game after you get a little too familiar with the cards in that game.  But it plays exactly the same, so here are my comments for that one:

"Play one of your invention cards into what you think is its proper place in a growing timeline and then flip it over to see if you were right.  Were you?  Then leave it there.  If you weren't, you discard it and draw another card.  Play until at least one player runs out of cards.  It doesn't sound like much, and folks with a good history background have an advantage, while its replayability will be affected by how good your memory is over time, but it's actually a neat little game with a nice narrative and some tactics to use over the course of the game.  You might even learn something as you play!  I do recommend drawing off of the bottom of the stack, though, so you don't get to see what your next card is going to be."

Played this mixed with Inventions and Historical Events.  I really liked having the different versions mixed together and felt it helped to even the playing field for everyone.  

I didn't love this set in particular, though.  A lot of the cards that came into play seemed to focus on things that happened around the time of the European explorers (discovery of different foods, animals, countries), so they were fairly easy to place.

Time-line is a quick trivia game focused entirely around dates.  Players will discard cards from their hand onto the right place on the timeline until you have no cards left.  As the timeline grows longer, the game gets harder.

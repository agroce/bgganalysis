RATING: 8
I read about this in the old Games & Puzzles magazine and just had to have it - I just couldn't believe that a game could be so good and I played dozens of times in my younger years. I never get it to the table these days because it's too long and other 18xx games would get selected ahead of it but I still look upon it with great fondness and it was probably my first "serious" game (along with the likes of Election X, and Hare & Tortoise.

I have some fond memories of 1829.  And of course, it was tremendously innovative. However, the stockmarket was static, the order companies came out was fixed, and the survey parties were just silly.  Totally eclipsed by 1830 and all that followed.

A fantastic design of railway building and share dealing way ahead of its time. There was really nothing to compare to 1829 in the mid 70's in terms of originality and innovative game play. I have the original edition from 1974 and have very fond memories of playing this both F2F and postally during the 70's and 80's. So why not a 10 rating then? On a Hall of Fame basis this game would certainly be a 10. But the reality is that I am unlikely to be playing this in preference to some of the later titles in the series unless the right circumstances arose or one of those nostalgic moments suddenly came over me, so a 6 is about right. 

Although it does not have the reputation as such and compared to many of the 18xx games that followed, 1829 is really quite brutal particularly the survey parties, the way bases totally shut out other company's routes and the promote anywhere on the board rules. Not unsurprisingly every subsequent game in the 18xx series dumped these for rules that were more forgiving and less gamey, although personally I am comfortable with the latter two. The survey parties are unique to 1829 (a variant in 1825) and for me are what makes this game different to the rest. My issue with them is how they are handled. The rules allow SPs to move to and occupy other SP hexes thereby denying them a track build. This can be fairly devastating and potentially terminal to a player's chances as it is perfectly possible to stop a company operating at all. The LSWR springs to mind here. I don't find this acceptable in a game that lasts a bare minimum of 6 hours but could stretch as long as 9. 

The alternative I used when playing was that an SP could only move to an empty hex (with the sole exception that a company's SP could always move to its own railhead whatever the circumstance). This served to dampen the aggressiveness of the SP moves. 

1829 also had other quirky and not well developed ideas such as the GWR and LSWR that were unable to run a route until their 3rd operating round. The subsequent 1825 series irons out most of the problems, so more likely I'd put the 1825 series 1 & 2 boards together if I wanted the 1829 experience. Best with 4 or 5 players.

RATING: 8
The granddaddy of the 18XX genre.  A fairly friendly stock market and the use of surveying parties are the main deviations from the more common 1830.  The only real downside to this game is the amount of time required to play.

Initial impression:

I liked it less than I imagined, but it might not be good for three players only.  Would take a lot of playing to "figure out" better.

Are the shares supposed to be so uninteresting after a certain point?  It's very track-building focused, but for three players, the number of shares=certificate limit, so no one wants to sell once everyone has shares enough (aside, perhaps, for the ports.

Definitely the start of a genre, but it shows it's age now, 18xx system has been developed and I'd much rather play one of the newer titles (or 1830) with more dynamic stock market and shorter game length

Very good, but outrageously long. Ruling out that consideration, still an excellent "core" game with 1830. Given the length considerations, however, 1853 is better.

Actually quite good. I think we removed the rule about having to scope out the land before laying track.

You're rewarded for building a solid company in this game, the stock game is rather simple and is just about timing. Also the train rust run is rather slow and low pressure until the very end game. You can also catch up if you make an error early on, which isn't the case in some other 18xx titles.

The only downside is that its the least interactive 18xx i've played to date. It is suitable for beginners imo, possibly the easiest to learn that i've played.

Some 18xx-ers really enjoy 1829.  I do not.  I have not played with a 1829 enthusiast crowd, so I may be 'missing' something, but there definitely appears to be best companies, and turn order for that selection appears more important than it should be.

I have no recorded plays for this game, but I believe I played one game at MIT SGS in the early 1980s.  In that game, I believe I didn't own a company and thought it was an amazingly silly game.

I've recorded a play in approximately the time frame in which I played it.

Stock market needs work.  Board aspects are pretty cool.  Lacks game balance as the private companies are a rip off but certain players must end up with them (and lose).  The later spin-offs 1830 and 1856 showed the true promise of the basic game design.

RATING: 7
Both a rating of 7 and a 3 apply to this game. I really like(d) it, but am unlikely ever to get a group together again in order to spend six to eight hours on a single game when you can play four or five modern games in the same period. It's definitely a classic, and that's not nostalgia talking.

Yes it shows its age, but this game deserves a 10 in that in created, quite brilliantly, a whole sub-genre.

I played this a number of times in the late 70's when it was the only version created. Yes, the rules had some loopholes and required agreement among the players on interpretation in advance of a session. We usually played at or near the 9 player maximum - quite a different experience if you ever get a chance to try it. You run a company at the whim of the other shareholders until you can get your hands on a majority , or at least plurality of a company's shares. With a relatively few rules changes (drop surveyors if you want), it is a good game - and clear why it spawned so many successor versions and loyal followers.

Game play is similar to other 18xx games, but due to the survey party rules, it takes about 25% longer.  Satisfying for fans of business games, light on supply/demand strategy.

RATING: 6
A rather plodding first installment of the long running 18xx series. Shares are issued in a rigid sequence, so until you become the director of a company you don't get much to do, and the game takes a long time to get going. This incarnation of the system has a vulnerability to negative play, such as using your survey party or track to completely block another company, something the designer (presumably) didn't intend. This game created a genre, but 1825 is identical, with the above issues fixed, in half the playing time.

There's nothing about an 18xx game that provides me any form of enjoyment, and so the prospect of spending another three hours(at minimum) per session at least half a dozen more times just to progress past the conscious incompetence stage is unappealing. The strategies and tactics of this genre will forever remain opaque to me.

The Original 18xx game. They all started here. Had a beginers, intermediate and advanced game. The beginers game was just really laying tiles, with no stock you just were your own company. 

It's a shame later games did not have similar rules as it made getting into the full game a lot easier. 1856 does have an introduction level but it does not actually work, this one did.

Components are not very good, but newer games are not that much better anyway.

I have played 1829 as a full business game once.  We played a variant, where we used 1830-style stock chart and 1830-style track promotions.  We did not use survey parties, and we allowed trains to run to an opponent's station marker.  Basically 1830 on the 1829 board.  FANTASTIC!!!!  

However, I would like to play this as originally written.  It would be interesting from a historical perspective to see the grandfather of all 18xx games played.

Compared to its offspring (i.e. other 18xx games) this has many differences, some of them quirky some quite charming. My feeling is that it could have benefited from more development, but maybe that is only from the hindsight of having experienced other 18xx's.

What I like:
- care-free portfolio optimization due to stock prices being not affected by trading and no director liability
- construction of track by building unit

What I liked less:
- building units can move arbitrarily far in the six hex directions
- fixed ordering of companies (shares are stacked and company must be sold out before next one can be started
- seemed like too much money in the back and too little train pressure to keep the pace up
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
One of the original train/ business games that still stands the test of time. Elements of tile laying strategy and stock and shares manipulation makes for a really engaging game. Probably a little on the long side (4+ hours) for the casual gamer.

The mother of all 18xx games. Francis Tresham's masterpiece. Still, after all these years, a true '10'. What a design! Even if there are better 18xx games out there, without this game design, they wouldn't exist. And shame, shame, shame to all of you 18xx designers, who do not mention the true autor of 'your' game on the box cover: the great Francis Tresham!

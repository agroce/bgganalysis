For a month or so this was the most played game in my house.  My kids were overboard into Star Wars, so I made it a point of really immersing them into Star Trek.  They seem to prefer Voyager of all the series, and they can't stand the original series.   Even so, this game completely consumes their imagination;  11, 9, and even 4 yo, they will play this literally for hours.  It's very kewel the way they'll play for awhile, and then go do something more active and come right back to it.  They think nothing of playing these massive multi-ship battles at Squadron scale, and I've yet to seem them even argue while playing.  

I'm rambling, but I'm trying to give a sense for just how popular this game is in my house.  Gee, maybe I should try it!  lol

Even so, I think Battlestations has displaced this game -- the role-playing element really engages them and keeps them talking about Battlestations even when not playing it.

We played the scenario that has the Doomsday Machine (aka Planet Killer).  After a furious battle that saw one of our best ships gutted like a public school budget we....
flushed that space turd!  

This game brings back good memories of SFBattles.  It still takes us a long time to play, but I am confidant that it will hit the table every now and then.

RATING: 7
A much more enjoyable way to engage in starship combat than [thing=1589]Star Fleet Battles[/thing].  This takes the best of SFB, improves the flow of the game, and strips out the excess complexity.  On-the-fly decisions make it more like Star Trek, "All power to the forward shields" / "I'm givin' it all I got, Captain!"  I played loads of SFB, and I can't see how anyone could think it is more enjoyable than this.

Update: Great game, but I got tired of the frustration of not playing opponents.  ADB is anti-VASSAL, so I am anti-ADB.  If I spend $100 on their games, I shouldn't have to pay a fee to play it online, so I traded my entire F.C. collection.

Update: I can make my own Vassal modules, so suck it, ADB.  Re-acquired.

I never played SFB so I can't comment on FedCom vs SFB. I've heard horror stories on the length and complexity of SFB, and if FedCom was developed to reduce complexity, they've done an outsanding job here. 

I feel the game captures tactical starship combat well in a 2d environment. After a few plays of the game, the cumbersome compents become rather easy to understand. 

The laminated Ship Record sheets provide a Battletech feel to the game and makes resolution of damage quick and easy.

The only drawback to the game is the immense amount of "booster" packs and expansions. Sure the segmented boosters/expansions enable someone to purchase what they need, but a larger box option should exsist.

Federation Commander is an excellent way of playing games in the Star Fleet Universe.  It's fast, easy, and the components look great.  It's much simpler than Star Fleet Battles.

It also plays very smoothly.  Very well done.

Another plus is the amount of extra material available for the system.  Through the various Booster Packs and expansion modules, plus Captain's Logs and Communiques, there's tons of new stuff for the game system, which will make it interesting and non-repetitive for a LONG time.

Nice streamlining of Star Fleet Battles, but I now realize that it does change the game to not have to micromanage your power during energy allocation. It's one of those simple changes that reverberates. It's close enough that a SFB player will feel comfortable (quickly) with the rules, but different enough to be worth exploring. Much less poker and bluffing, and more of an emphasis on maneuver. (Whether that's good or bad is up to you).

I bought this game based soley on the comments of other members, and I must say, so far it is worth the money.

RATING: 7
This game requires a lot more rules study than the average game. Compared to Star Fleet Battles, it's much simpler, but still the most detailed Star Trek tactical ship game since that game. If you win it's because you're better and probably not because you're lucky (though luck is a factor). Ship miniatures (if you use them, you don't have to there are counters) are decent looking but mini breakage from carrying is endemic. It's worth playing, if only for historical reasons. Star Trek for wargamers.

I had a chance to learn this game with a seasoned pro who was extremely gracious, and did a wonderful job of teaching. Unfortunately, the complexity of the game was more than I'm willing to live with in my current gaming environment (family,friends). I don't really have any hard-core gamers that I can get together with regularly. If there were local gamers who were into this game, that I enjoyed gaming with, I would certainly play but alas... it looks like this game will more than likely get traded away.

Really cool system, not as complex as it seems (fat rulebook).  Just read the first few sections, then play a couple of turns out.  When its time to use a new weapon system the first time, read the relevant section.

Game is very procedural, and the rulebook is excellent.  No other game is quite like it, and its a great topic.

Now only if they had a Next Generation license, that would be awesome.  I'd love to see the new ships rated versus the old.

RATING: 8
Impossible.  They made SFB _fun_.  Gone are the days of enormous, overstuffed binders of rules hauled around by enormous, overstuffed men- FedCom is sleek, sexy, and actually quite exciting to play.  The rules still have that "written by an engineer" look and feel but after a few turns the game flows well and the rules are straightforward, logical, and easy to grasp.  The difficulty is not so much imbedded in the system, but that there are lot of options with the payoff being that the level of simulation that SFB is still here without all the fidgety, full-frontal nerdity that once put it in the ASL bracket of probably great but terminally inaccessible games.  There's a couple of dodgy things here and there (never quite satisfied with the drone rules), but by and large it's just nitpicking a great game.  The look on Euro-snobs' faces when they see all the deceptively complex-looking charts and ship profiles is absolutely PRICELESS.

RATING: 9
This game is an excelent entry point to Trek Space Combat, or the SFB universe. the Rules are simple and laid out reasonably well ((there were some tweeks I would have made, but this is personal preference. Speciacally on telling us how to mark of damage before we know how to fire a phaser I found irksome)).

I played through three duels in an afternoon, and watched another person run three limited engaugements ((2-3 ships on a side)) in one  afternoon. 

It's fast, it's quick, It plays like the classic Trek shows combat. Play this, and play it now.

Federation Commander is a slimmed-down version of Star Fleet Battles, so as a result, it has much of the same gameplay but with much of the chrome scrubbed off. Personally, I prefer the meatier Star Fleet Battles. I think a lot of the fun of SFB is lost with this scaled-down version.

RATING: 10
Starship combat on the table-top doesn't get better than this, especially if you are a Star Trek fan.  Don't get me wrong, X-Wing is great, but you can't beat the feel of taking large capitol ships with complex weapons, defenses and multi-facing shield systems up against each other in tactical battle.  FC is a spectacular refinement of the original and more cumbersome Star Fleet Battles system. This is the perfect game balance with enough rules complexity to offer a very strategic and exciting turn-by-turn battle experience with many tactical options but is not too complex requiring pages and pages of charts, tables and rules referencing.

This rich TOS Star Trek universe, with so many ships, races, and scenarios to play, gives limitless possibilities.  Add minis to the mix and it looks like a fantastic starship battle on your table top.

My Goldilocks game: Star Fleet Battles was too hard, other space combat games are too soft, but this is just right. I wanted to like Star Fleet Battles, but I found the system bogged down too much to have any fun with it. Federation Commander streamlined the problems I had with SFB while keeping enough to give me what I wanted.

The game is highly modular: you only need a handful of the rules to get started, and you can add additional rules when you're ready.

Federation Commander comes to the table purporting to be an updated, simplified version of SFB. Well, color me impressed. I really enjoyed this. Usually, in SFB, you spent most of your time checking your ship's data sheet, and looking up rules. Not here. Here, you pretty much just go for it. It's definitely a more seat-of you-pants kind of feeling, almost like you're really a starship captain, making split second decisions in combat. You actually get to spend more time playing the game, which is always a huge plus. The full color charts for weapons firing and damage allocation are splendid - the damage allocation has been made very simple, with a minimum of dice rolling. The SSDs are also color coded, which makes finding appropriate boxes to mark off much easier and they're laminated, which means that you can use dry erase markers. This also removes the necessity of xeroxing the SSDs, which is good, because the color coding wouldn't copy properly. Another new improvement to the SSDs is that they're dual-sided. There are two sets of stats for each ship. The one side is "Fleet scale", which can be used when you want a shorter more cutthroat game. The other side is "Squadron scale" which essentially doubles the number of boxes for each system on the ship, which can make for a longer game without changing ship types. This flexibility is a huge plus.  Overall, I'd have to say that my impression of this new offering is very positive. Although I likely won't purchase this - mainly because my wife won't play - I won't turn down a chance to play it. Anyone who played SFB and is still trying to recover from the confusion, I highly recommend this re-working of a classic.

RATING: 8
Suspend a little scientific belief and get on your inner Trekkie and this is a highly enjoyable ship to ship/squadron v squadron space combat romp. Rule set is nicely streamlined and accessible and the combat presents a multitude of decisions and tactical options - the drone rules may need some tinkering with.

Some will dislike the book-keeping aspect (dry-marker pens and laminated ship cards) but it is really no more onerous than some of the cube shuffling inherent to many euro games.

The sets, boosters and mini pack options are somewhat bewildering at first.

RATING: 3
This game succeeds in its goal of being a more accessible SFB.  I can say that with assurance as I flunked out of the Academy trying to learn SFB.  But in the time this game took to be made, another game came out to fill the accessible star ship combat niche.  Battlestations absolutely spanks this game's butt.  In power management, boarding actions, character development, scenario play, campaign play, locational damage, repair; basically Battlestations does everything Star Treky better.  Except have Klingons.

Update 6-3: Got to play this with a diehard Trek fan.  And they pointed out how incredibly un-Star Trek this game is.  There is nothing slow and methodical about Kirk's space fights.  Opened my eyes that this game is, in fact, crappy slow and dull.

RATING: 6
Federation Commander has all the right elements to make it the premier space game: asymmetrical fleets, impulse movement, shields that add another tactical consideration, and a fairly fast play sequence. It dethrones Silent Death as my favorite space game. 
 
They suceeded in streamlining the old convoluted SFB into a relativley straightforward game, keeping the strategic decisions and losing the trivial obscurities from the rules. Overall gamers seem to have overlooked what a great, fun game this is and focused on their personal expectations or technical gripes about the product. The fact is that this release is the best news in ages for anyone who has ever overloaded a photon torpedo.

This game is a revamped version of [gameid=1589].  It is faster to play, and has an easier ruleset.  I prefer to play this game day to day more than [gameid=1589] because it is faster to play, and I don't have to study the rulebook like an exam before I play.  I prefer this to [gameid=1589], but I rate them the same since I have so many good memories of [gameid=1589]. 

This is my favorite "Wargame" right now.  It will be a "10" once it hits 10 years old.

This is a great game.  If you liked [gameid=1589] when you were younger, try this game.  If you like Star Trek, try this game.  If you like wargames, and would like to add a sci-fi element to a wargame, try this game.

This was the original "base game," so all my plays of [b]Federation Commander[/b] games will be recorded here as the "base game."

A much simplified cousin to the redoubtable Star Fleet Battles, Federation Commander keeps all the flavour and intensity, whilst ditching many of the 'fiddly' rules and concentrating on the essentials of energy management.  The spend it as required approach adds a whole new dimension to this franchise which rewards both careful planning and crisis management.  Using enough power to maintain high speed to allow you to dictate the battle, whilst holding sufficient back to delver the crunch blow when your careful maneuvering finally bears fruit, is a delicate balancing act at the best of times.  The beautifully produced ship laminates provide the budding ships captain with everything they need to plot weapon fire, track energy usage and mark damage.  Production values are definatly higher than SFB and use of Fleet and Squadron scales allow players to conduct single ship duels or fleet battles in the same amount of time.  This package only deals with the Klingons and Kzinti's but various expansions cover all the rest of the Federation's allies and enemies as seen in the games elder brother.

This is a blast.  Let's face it, the best part of the Star Trek series was when two ships met and started blasting away.  Those sequences were always over too soon for my taste.

My gaming buddies don't seem interested.  Apparently they're still detoxing from their years playing [gameid=1589].  Sigh.  0-1

The amazing thing is how easy it is to learn the rules. Yet, the game brims with tactical options (although the simple rules may lead to some gamey-ness). The sense of excitment in manoeuvring your ship and firing your weapons is unbelievable with no downtime or mucking around with complex tables and calculations.

The other praiseworthy point is the sheer magnitude of the world and its ships and how easily available they all are to players. (Plus the game is always in print!) Kudos to the company.

Fun game, wasnt as complicated as I would have thought (but I played without a few options to get a feel for the game).

If I were to be honest the production quality is very poor, old school type components a rulebook that looks like my desktop laser printer had just finished printing it out and poorly printed hex maps (dont line-up nice). Now I know perhaps it wasnt like this before they sent it to the printers but the cost isnt jusitifed for what you get component-wise (besides the game being fun and worth your time).

This SSD's are very nice and im jealous that I didnt get a component out like these sooner.
In summary, The game is worth your money- buy it, but dont be surprised if you feel a little let down by the components.

May rating would be a 7, if I had to have bought the game myself.

Good starship combat game with transporters, boarding parties and "on the fly" power allocation.  Probably most fun with ships no larger than cruiser size.  I like the Fleet Scale/Squadron Scale aspect of the game.

Obviously, by proof of the myriad articles and manuals this game's big brother "Star Fleet Battles" has spawned, "Federation Commander" has tactical nuances and choices for the experienced player.  Unfortunately this game doesn't hold my interest enough for me to want to learn them.

There's a lot of maneuvering and little shooting.  I can't help but view the basic tactics of the game as "close distance, roll dice and pray for better results than your opponent", but I'm glad this is out there.

Decided to distill my thoughts:

Simply put it is not worth the money in comparison to other gaming options.  Here's some simple math:

180 dollars for only 64 ships over 5 or 6 races.  That is what you can expect to play for Klingon Border, Klingon Attack, Romulan Border, and Romulan Attack.  It's too much money for what you can expect to pay for the full game.  This repeats ADB's tendency to make expansions rather than full games.  So in considering the value of the game, we have to consider the future costs associated with it and to me that price is way too high for the relative small number of ships per race.


Check out other board game offerings just in Klingon Borders price range.  Look at Memoir '44.  Look at Twilight Imperium.  Look at War of the Ring.  With all these other games, you get many, many, in some cases hundreds of plastic playing pieces not paper chits as in Klingon Border. With those other games, you get better quality and more numerous color components, play aids, and rules, whereas Klingon Border comes with an untrimmed Black and White rulebook.  In fact, you just simply get more with Memoir, TI, and WOTR than with Klingon Border.


Lastly, let's consider what you are getting in terms of gaming concepts.  Much of the intellectual material here is 20-25 years old.  The game is largely repackaged Star Fleet Battles materials.  Same ships, same weapons, same damage charts, same basic concepts in general.  While the system has been streamlined, the innovations are no great leap forward and these "new" gaming mechanics could have been applied to SFB years and years ago if ADB had not been focused on making expansions and had focused on gameplay issues.  

The long and short of it:

The game has below average components and number of components in comparison to other games at its price point.  And while it may play differently than SFB and be enjoyable, I don't think it is worth its money considering the history of the franchise and the hidden costs of the expansions which will be 180 bucks total.  ADB claims euro game quality materials and gameplay but it did not deliver that, yet you are expected to pay a euro game price.

In any guise, Star Fleet Battles remains one of the all-time classic wargames. I prefer this version over the original -- the rules are slimmed down but you don't miss a lot, and I like some things better (particularly the movement system, and they pay-as-you-go energy allocation). My only regret is that this game does not play substantially faster than the original -- you are still blocking out 3-odd hours for a battle (maybe a bit less if you go with the more fragile Fleet Scale ships). I like it plenty but don't bet to play wargames all that much any more.

Had to pick this up.  It seems that after 20 years of not playing SFB, I've been lured back into the fold with Federation Commander and its accursed modules!  Once a recovering SFB addict, always a recovering SFB addict...  But, this stuff is so nice and the new system so playable, it's a great buy.  Lots of replayability and fast moving once you get the system down.

**Finally got this on the table with some non-SFB players and they enjoyed it - as did I.  The flow is much faster and easy to follow.  The speed up/slow down during a turn functionality threw some of the players into confusion, but that was most likely due to my explantion of the functionality.  It's a great feature, though, and keeps the game fluid.

**More plays at Gen Con '08 - this time using miniatures and a felt starfield mat.  Wow...really adds a lot to an already great game.

A great, lighter version, of Star Fleet Battles akin to the ASL starter kits.  The game is streamlined and quickened, while sacrificing little from it's bigger brother.

Positive First:
-well written rulebook.
-excellent laminated SSD's.
-nice counters.
-eliminated a lot of low-benefit chrome from SFB.

Negatives:
-the sectioned map was a bad idea.  A GMT deluxe map would have looked much better.
-The 8 firing 'windows' with ships moving up to 32 spaces a turn doesn't work IMHO.  There is too much movement between firing chances, resulting in ships flying past each other without shooting.  tactically challenging I guess, but too 'gamey' for my taste.  Note that this works in Attack Vector because A)the ships aren't moving so fast and B)the ships have inertia and acceleration/deceleration limits.
-too much flexibility to cancel moves, speed up, adjust speed to the enemy.  Again, tactics are interesting, but it feels more like a fighter than a ship.
-the 1/4 movement ships are unbalanced.
-the game costs too much for the number of ships and scenarios you get.

So, it probably works as a game that faintly resembles starship combat, but I'm not really interested...

On the fence with this one. It streamlined SFB significantly. A game can be set up and played in two hours if you know what you're doing.

The thing is... it's not as fun. The core of SFB was the pre-planned energy allocation. It took a while but SFB really felt like you were captaining a ship. This game doesn't.

The manual for this one though is terrible. It's poorly laid out, poor quality (looks like a photocopy), doesn't flow near as logically, harder to look stuff up.. and randomly has unrelated infodumps interdispersed in it.

Faster playing derivative of STAR FLEET BATTLES.  Good for friends that aren't up for the full SFB experience or you just don't want to put the time/brainpower into a full SFB session.

Beautiful ship cards.  Excellent map board.

Starfleet battle for the dummies! No, it's a joke! The game is a simplified version of Starfleet battle. The simplifications hadn't impaired the interest of the game and to the contrary is now comprehensible and manageable by all space geeks. The game is also faster than before.

I played Starfleet Battles very briefly back in the day. Although the pre-recording of 32 impulses was a neat mechanic, forcing one to anticipate where the enemy would be at certain times, I was not pleased with the damage allocation of the combat system. Everything was random in terms of what system was hit. This, to me, was not realistic, given that the 23rd Century supposedly had sophisticated computer technology. Drones and the inclusion of other non-canon items quickly turned me off of the game.

Flash forward 25 years: Federation Commander has slicker components--the laminated status sheets are great, and the simultaneous 8 Impulse turns seem to have streamlined the game. However, the totally random damage allocation method still exists, although it has been reformatted. A single D6 allocates every 10 pts of damage. Drones still exist, and are still annoying. There are three types of phasers, when the TV series clearly had only one type. Phaser hits are automatic, but damage is a matter of range. In the cases of disruptors and photon torpedos, how much power was allocated into them determines damage, and there is some probability they will miss. We played a lopsided scenario where a pair of Klingon D7's, and two smaller ships took on a convoy of freighters, a Federation light cruiser, and a War Destroyer. It took over 90 minutes just to get past the 1st turn! However, the devastation of point-blank weapons fire became clearly evident. Over all, it took over three hours, just to play over two turns, but that was all that was needed for the Klingons to barely win. The game drips with theme, and tense life-or-death decisions abound. Federation Commander seems to have made the game more playable. However, it still takes awhile to get several turns in. But if ship-to-ship combat is what you want in the Star Trek universe, then Federation Commander is a winner.

Played introductory game with me lad who adores this game.

The game play consists of getting close enough to each other to do some damage and then firing at each other and this is where the luck of the dice comes in from low damage to high damage based on a die roll. Oh, what fun - NOT!

And you keep doing this until one of you is wiped out.

Kind of like what I imagine root canal work without anesthetic would be - extremely painful.

A really good update of the SFB system.  I have had this game since the ziplock bag 1st edition in '79, but of late had found i was playing SFB less (partly because of SFC-Orion pirates being available on PC.  But this update to the system has brought the playing time down to a reasonable play in an hour or 2, or longer for fleet actions.  It flows more freely and has removed some of the clutter of SFB leaving a streamlined, atmospheric game that is really SFB as it always should have been.  An excllent game.

Disclosure: I "work" as an uncompensated "ambassador" to BGG for FC. I don't review the games (except for the First Missions booklet, which I reviewed prior to my "role"). Mainly, I just relate on the FC boards what's discussed on BGG and pass off questions that I can't answer.

FC is a well-designed, fairly intricate tactical starship combat game set in the "Star Fleet Universe" (think TOS fleshed out, with a heavier dose of war than of exploration). I've never played Star Fleet Battles, but by all reports, this is a simpler, streamlined rule set. The rules are quite clear (and well indexed--a big plus) but will require a fairly substantive time investment to grasp, and expect to lose some of the finer details without regular practice. It's a bit pricey at $60 MSRP considering what you get--cardboard starfield hex panels, about 250 counters, laminated starship diagrams (SSDs in SFB-speak, but usually called "ship cards" in FC), and the rulebook. Components wise, think "good wargame," not "top-of-the-line Euro." The 1" counters are big by wargame standards and nicely illustrated. Gameplay is good and fluid, but I think even with some experience, even a two-ship duel at "fleet scale" (where ships can take less damage) will take a bit longer than the alleged hour; of course, you don't have to play till one or the other side is destroyed, either. Entertaining, and certainly a lot of support (including online and PBEM games and a very responsive designer and marketing staff). If you're interested in the idea of FC, check out the free PDF from the publisher (reviewed by me under Federation Commander: Klingon Border). And of course there are a ton of pewter minis you can buy for this (strictly optional). This is one of a few games I regret not having more time and more partners for.

This is one of the best starship games I have ever had the fortune of playing.  The rules run smooth and are easy to find in the book.  (Unlike SFB which can take quite awhile for a turn and you may take 15min to and hour to look up a rule)  The hex board is my only real complaint about the game, but if I understand right ADB had some trouble with the first company who was supposed to do the maps so this is their 2nd or 3rd choice.  But the best thing I can say about this game is I came over to this board (after finding out about it reading other boards about FC) and posted about the game.  I almost never post and only lurk, but I felt I must share this excellent game with everyone.

The Good: Great theme. Very detailed. Get to manage power/weapons/speed/shields, etc of a starship ! Has a few scenarios, but more can be found on the web. Can play more than 2 players. Neat extra is that a "Planet Eater" mega-ship comes with it, so there is a scenario to do battle against it.

The Bad: Rulebook is huge; BIG learning curve. Plays kind of long. I estimate an initial SHORT scenario will run maybe 3 hours. However, hopefully this time will come way down after the first play. Has so many expansions it is taking on a collectable aspect. You can play just fine with the initial set - however you will be limited to pretty much just Klingon/Federation.

This is the new faster play space combat game from the makers of Star Fleet Battles.  As such, it succeeds admirably.  It is not, however, a vast reimagining or a ground up redesign as some of the advertisements say, in my opinion.

Nonetheless, it takes what many consider to be one of the most solid rules for space combat gaming and removes much of the clutter and rules jockeying.  This eliminates a vast amount of fluff but still retains much of the tactical depth of Star Fleet Battles.  Certain aspects of the new rules require SFB players to learn a new tactical set as there are up to four hexes of movement between firing opportunities.  This should be little or no problem for those used to gaming with Starmada, Silent Death, Full Thrust, B5W, etc. as those rules sets allow a much greater amount of movement between firings and no one seems to complain about that.

One of the many good things about this game is the lack of performing ALL movement before firing and not having an initiative system, which can make games devolve into desperately hoping you win initiative this turn so you can shoot first.

Many comments, both positive and negative, have been made about this game.  Many of the complaints are valid but I think that the effort is good, the components solid, and the game is fun to play.  A matter of taste but the game play is the thing for me.

If you are a fan of SFB or used to be or if you enjoy space combat in a Trek universe, you will enjoy this game.  The price tag is steep, perhaps too steep for some, but I found it fairly reasonable given the market size for these types of games.

Although it plays quicker than SFB, it still takes some time to play a game out if you are power gamers always looking to make the best moves.  We played a 2 vs. 2 ship battle for our first game and it still took over two hours, although that was with looking up the rules and discussing the game as we went.  Your mileage may very based on your play style.

Pros:
  Ship cards - impressive looking
  Mounted map - I like the sturdier map
  Simple rules - can learn fairly quickly
  Based on SFB - a great game to start from to some
  Megahex counters - nice graphics
  Quicker play than SFB
  An official Fed Com grease pencil - I am kidding

Cons:
  Mounted map - warps and the panels can separate; using the big hex side means a map that is too small until you buy more panels
  Rulebook quality - laser printed and untrimmed, could have been better
  Based on SFB - A game some people dislike or quit playing for various reasons
  Ships - not a lot of ships to start with

RATING: 8.2
This is a playable and approachable version of Star Fleet Battles.  There is an introductory rule set, which can be mastered by an eight to ten year old.  The game has two scales and components come in two sizes.  Personally, I like the smaller scale, and I use the paper Star Fleet Battles map which is lighter.  

The game plays quickly using one to two ships per side.  The movement is cinematic and quick.  The combat phase takes a little longer, but damage management system feels real and compelling.  You could feel the pain the first salvo wipes out your shields and the second ripped through your ship.

This is one of my two favorite space combat games, the other is Firestorm Armada.  With a single or small number of ships, Federation Commander the way to go.  However, Three to five ships per side is the maximum practical limit of ships per side, where Firestorm Armada can handle two dozen.

This game can be modified for enjoyable solo play.  Fight space monsters or attack Star bases.  There are a number of ways to play solo. 

Amarillo Design Bureau provides more support for its game systems than almost any other game company.  There are bunch of free ship cards for this game.

This game is worth the money.

RATING: 8
This is an excellent game and at its core it isn't too complex. Any additional complexity comes when you start doing all the stuff might only do once or twice in a scenario: Marine Combat, Emergency Evacuation, Suicide Shuttles, etc.

Has a nice original Star Trek flavor, despite the limitations of ADB's license. To their credit the Starfleet Universe is pretty expansive and fleshed out.

I'd pick this up before Romulan Border if you are interested in the game simply because RB adds Plasma Torpedoes and Cloaking on top of all the other rules which might be too much for first time players.

Successful design in streamlining the key aspects of SFB in a more playable, faster playing and (imo) more enjoyable game.  

Dogfightting/tactical games at this scale need to move fast, else they lose something (sometimes a lot) in game play.

Key example:  SPI's Air War where each turn takes alot of real time to play but each turn represents something like 2.5 seconds.

Federation Commander corrects this problem that was endemic of SFB and it's 32 impulses per turn (which in practice was often painfully slow and tedious).  

The original SFB incremental impulse movement/action system is best for duel type situations and starts to crack under it's own weight with any scenario:  above squadron level actions, involving a good number of fighters/PFs and ships that can launch many, many seeking weapons.

I got and played Starfleet Battles long ago, but the harsh reality of real life stopped me from diving in, learning all the rules, and really getting into it.

I'm not sure about this one. On one hand, the one time I go to play it (at a game meetup with lots of other games going on around me) I didn't really feel like I was enjoying it. On the other hand, I keep looking at the manual to stay current with the rules so I can play it again. I feel I'll enjoy it when I finally get around to playing it in a more quiet location.

As for the game itself, the rules are well written and the components are fine for a hex and counter game (not GMT quality - grey borders on the maps). Plus, Star Trek! Pew pew pew! Klingon bastards! You killed my son!

This game is a great simulator for Star Trek battle scenarios. The rules are a bit complicated to understand at first, but after you play through a few turns, they become more intuitive. The rules are not too fiddly, and with the player aid turns go smoothly. The way it's designed, it seems like it would be easy to expand on and add new ships and scenarios to.

After a few more plays, it seems like the best strategy is to fly towards each other and just unleash a huge volley of fire and hope you do more damage. Maybe this could be mitigated by scenarios that don't focus on combat, but this was the major problem that we found. Also, it takes a few hours to play a game, and much of that is just maneuvering, so it's not all that interesting.

Sigh... such an improvement over SFB. Short rules, quick gameplay. Too bad there are so few ships in the box. Also, the gameboard is not very good. I bought a Megamat from Chessex to solve this problem. 1" counters are good. Game is a bit expensive for what you get, no matter what S. V. Cole might say...

For bigger battles, I will still need to make photocopies as there's only one laminated ship diagram per ship in the box. So, if there are 2 Klingon D7 in a battle, I need a photocopy.

I still "had" to buy it, being a fan of SFB but not having the time to play it anymore.

Had a game hence the initial ratings but it was a good game. It feels like a combination of the old Bab 5 Wars plus the new one released by Mongoose. Overall it does not have that "you move all then I move mine" feel that most games have and I think the impluses (reads rounds) in this case serves its purpose very well. I especially like the energy allocation and how you need to manage your weapon fire. In all this shows a lot of promise and am most eager to try it soon. Time permitting.

Very disappointed by quality of materials. Back in the day (the 1980's) when this was all the quality we had, it was awesome. Today? No way.

[2014] : I was a huge fan of the original SFB game, played in 2 national tournaments, traveled to WI and GA, Columbus, Toledo, and elsewhere, even played SF Warlord by mail, had my name and tactical advice printed in an SFB Tactics guide, and owned every single thing produced by the designer including 100 miniatures, all painted and detailed, until 1992 when I sold it all.

I made a run at getting back into the game when this came out - and I was really crushed when I discovered the just inconceivable components.

There. Was. A. Paper. Clip. In. The. Box. And. It. Was. Expected. That. You. Would. Use. It. To. Track. Stuff.

Really.

I had been playing Euros for a while, and yes, I had gotten WAY SPOILED by the quality of these games.

This is a BIG and DEEP system, and ADB and their fans are great gamers. I will never forget the fun and friendships I had during the 80s and early 90's with the SFB game system.

I know there are people out there who still enjoy SFB and all the spinoff products, and I used to be one of them. It's too bad that this once-great-franchise has to limp along like this.

I liked this game. It's simpler than the modified version of Star Fleet Battles that I had played (once). I still had very little understanding of the game, but I was able to pick up on some things fairly easy. It helped that all of the other people really knew SFB well. I like how the damage chart is set up, and the cards for the ships were well thought out and easy to follow once you understand what every thing is. The impulse system has been simplied a great deal and is much easier to mangage. I played both the Squadron and Fleet versions. It's nice that the fleet version has about half the stats (except for damage) so it can be a fairly quick game.

While I had fun playing this, I will never get into it like the other players in my group, but I still won't mind playing it once in a while.

This is not an improvement to SFB.  I have not played SFB in 18 years but I can still remember the basic rules.  I did not find these rules easier to master -- supposedly the virtue of this game.  Nor did I find the production value equivalent to the $60 price tag.  One of the very few games that I would never bother playing again.

Starfleet Battles little brother. The glossly ship display cards and counters are good production value. The rules have been toned down to let new players learn the game fairly easily yet offer some greater flexibility in maneuver which makes a tactically challenging game.

Excellent space battle game which can also embrace miniatures.

Vast improvement over its (for me, at least) almost unplayable older sibling. Nevertheless, I found it very difficult to get planning and timing the ships' movement into my head at first. However, I am sure with experience this would get easier, making the game for more enjoyable. If I get the chance to play more, this rating may well go up.

It does a good job with streamlining the Star fleet battle rules.  The base set should come with more map.

Great downscaling of an overly complex tactical starship combat system.  Don't believe the "up to Eurogame standards" hype, though.

Awesome game. Have been playing since early rounds of playtesting and it just gets better and more fun as I develop new tactics to counter my opponents new tactics to counters my new tactics...

Not SFB-lite or Euro-SFB - said descriptions are a bit insulting, in fact.  Sure the decision-tree has been pruned back a bit, but a whole re-planting would have been better.  Why have 8 firing opportunities, but 32 movement pulses?  This does not shorten the game.  And how sad is it that we had unanswered questions about a ruleset that has been tweaked for thirty+ years?  The only successful innovation is the dismissal of the EAF.  Now SFB is up to 1989 standards!  Hooray!  Nobody will want this unless they used to play SFB in college, and want some nostalgia game time for a couple hours every few weekends.

Greatly enjoyed playing this game.  I felt like I should be sitting in a commander chair and ordering ensigns to fire.  I always want to play this game!

This game initially seemed like it was a little over kill compared to what i usually enjoy, though once i got familiar with the rules the learning curve was fairly easy.  great game.  good tactical elements, more of a simulation than most bash em up ship games.  has actual strategy.  good production values etc.  i give it a thumbs up

I've been wanting to get back into Star Fleet Battles and this may be the better way to do it with modern day time constraints and so many different other games calling at once. The components are beautiful and it would certainly be easy to use the miniatures also sold for this or even the small collection of the old Galoob starships I've gotten over the years!

1 play, 2er. A nice simplification of the old Star Fleet Battles system. Rating could go up with repeated play, but I doubt I'll be playing this much with our group.

You actually begin to think like a starship commander as you hear yourself angrily bark orders to divert power from propulsion to weapons. The cat-and-mouse battles are infectiously fun!

A much streamlined version of Star Fleet Battles, that feels quite different in play.  It plays much faster, with all of the fun but a fraction of the rules work.

Easy game to learn and play. The 1" counters are great. The laminated ship cards are top notch. Game moves fast and the tactics will take a while to master - each race will take different tactics to play as and against.

So glad that a "light" system of Starfleet Battles was released.  Can't get enough of this game; it's quick, simple, yet fun with the variety it offers.

I like the Fed Com game and it's not that hard to learn and I love the theme.  But the game does seem kind of dry and I'm not a big fan of the 'All ships in a big arena' battle every man for himself type scenario.  It think this is much better as an admiral my fleet mission based game, but I haven't gotten to play those all that much.

A Fun simplification of the classic StarFleet Battles game, which makes playing it enjoyable again.  4 experienced players completed a game in just over an hour, and 2 rank beginners completed a basic duel in about 45 mins.

as a system, it's a streamlined version of the old SFB - though I would say it is still somewhat fiddly for today's market - as a product, it's greatly over-priced and suffers from an overuse use of colors

This game might not be for everyone but if you've wanted to try Star Fleet Battles but found the rules daunting this is may be the game for you.  If you like and play SFB then you will have to decide for yourself if you are interested in a streamlined version.  If you compare components to other games you might think you see something lacking but the rules and background more than make up for anything a person might perceive as lacking.  Overall a very nice addition to the space combat genre.

Initial rating after one play. Left me craving more and I spent the next 3 days reading reading everything I could about the game, the system, and the star fleet universe.

EDIT: Bumped to a 10 after 13 plays in 2 months. One of the quickest runs to 10-plays of any game I own, and certainly of any game that takes 60+ minutes to play.

Just takes too long, with too few meaningful decisions.  It looks fantastic with painted minis, and the Trekkie inside of me wants to love it (even though it's TOS :devil: ) but the system of impulses and sub-impulses is about 4 times too clunky for my taste.  There absolutely has to have been a better way to do that, and the game suffers immeasurably for it

If the designers had seriously tried to reimagine SFB instead of stripping it down, this could have been awesome.  As it stands, I just can't believe that someone published a game with 32 impulse phases in the 21st century

This is QUITE an impressive title.  The ship control sheets have to be seen to be believed - remarkable quality.  The map boards also look great (although the 1/2" scale board does look better than the 1" scale board due to the lack of a 'border' around each section), as do the counters.  The use of 'pay as you go' energy allocation using power tokens makes the game quick to play (no long downtimes while someone agonizes over a paper form), and gives a greater feeling of flexibility.  Federation Commander: Klingon Attack (with the corresponding 'unique' ships in the 6 boosters) is really needed to round out the fleets in this game, though - so many races represented!

We all gotta eat - so I can't begrudge the re-packaging of SFB material into this multi-layered system of core sets, expansions, boosters and supporting miniatures. It's a good game, but I wish it went even farther in streamlining. Ultimately I prefer the old '79 Designer's Edition of Star Fleet Battles for cruiser duels.  

I can't get over my Fed CA having a Drone Rack.

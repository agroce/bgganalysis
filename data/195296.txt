Not a bad game but I would advise NOT playing it with the Scurvy expansion. It saps any fun out of the game and really drags it out.

The best cuttle I've ever played. I've played a lot of Cuttle variants, and this is somehow simultaneously the best designed, the most accessible, the cutest and the deepest. I've not reviewed a game on BGG before, but this thing is a masterpiece.

I picked this up to play with my daughters who enjoy it though I personally find it rather underwhelming. One thing I did find it useful for was introducing ‘take that’ aspects to gaming with kids. Since they didn’t enjoy feeling picked on when treasure of theirs was stolen, I used the opportunity to teach a lesson about managing their emotions during game play with this and similar mechanics so it wouldn’t ruin their fun. My girls still request to play this game enough that it makes our regular rotation, though we increase the end goal to 25 or even 30 points in order to have games last longer and grow more interesting. The art style is really well done.

Enjoyable to get people of different ages playing together. It seemed a bit bewildering at first, being a game I had not played before. Fortunately, a 10 and a 12-year-old niece had played so they helped us get into it. Then it was fun. The variations can add to the complexity. I need to play it more often so I understand the options.

Great for families with young kids. My 9 year old adores this game. Prior to getting a copy, we wore out our homemade copy of the print and play. The main negative I have is that the cards require Standard USA sleeves which I personally find to be less common. The cards, while linen aren't super thick and you will be shuffling a lot due to how quick the games are. As a result sleeving is essential.

Enjoyable enough game, but the game is pretty much just "I put down treasures threatening a win, now you have to stop me" and vice versa over and over again until one of the players has run out of cards that can stop the other player. The abilities are interesting although sometimes seem almost too powerful (like the game went way longer than it needed to because the state of the board kept resetting), but if it didn't, this would probably be a 5 minute game, since you could put down three medium-to-high cards as treasures in three consecutive turns and win otherwise.

It sort of feels like just the endgame of Munchkin, but a lot faster. Munchkin can take hours, whereas this game would take probably 20 minutes, max. Which I'm fine with. Another Kickstarter game that feels extremely similar to this game (but with a different theme) is Control. In fact, they're so similar I would assume they were designed by the same people if I didn't know for a fact that they weren't already. Edit: Just found out they were both based on a much older game, Cuttle, so that explains that.

The artwork is gorgeous and it's easy enough to teach, and it's pretty portable, so I'll probably hang on to it. Enjoyable, but not anything special.

Very simple and fast game. Draw a card or play a card. First player to reach 21 wins. Its fun to manipulate the cards with the different abilities and you always need to find ways to stop your opponent. But sometimes you dont have any cards to stop your opponent so its very luckbased that way. Also the game is promoted that it could be played and enjoyed by kids and adults but i found two cards that i needed to get some clarification and thats not ok if two 6 years old children are playing it. It should be super simple to understand. Other than that its a fun simple game. And the artwork is really nice!

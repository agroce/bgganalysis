A neat filler game of bidding and set-collecting, with a nasty thieving element to it, which doesn't put me off (as it normally might) because the whole thing feels so light. 

Traded away since I don't often play fillers, and this wouldn't top my list. I'd play For Sale instead. Traded along with Modern Art, for Power Grid: The First Sparks.

And bought another bargain copy! My Friese collection had a gap in it for this game.

Quite fun. It's an extremely easy filler.  You have to work out what everyone else is going to do as best as you can and try to do something different, whilst also keeping an eye on what is available on the set-collection cards.

Published in 2002. This 2012 version has improved artwork.
Best with just 3 or 4 players, otherwise the final scoring will be uneven, because during play most time some players will not be able to play at all due to playing same numbered cards as other players.

This game only made it to my collection as a Redakai starting deck ordered somehow got lost and so I chose this instead because it was priced exactly the same. And I'm glad it happened, as it's acutally not a bad little guessing & set collecting game. You might have a lot of bad luck, always playing the same value cards and often having to stay home, not collecting anything, but it's not that frustrating in such a light game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
Each player simultaneously plays a card from 0-5. Card determines who gets to draft first and how many items from the supply. If you tie with someone then the tiebreaker determines who gets to draft and the loser of the tie breaker does not draft at all. Use drafted items to complete sets for VP. Not terribly interesting. The strategy involves looking at what players have, looking at potential conflicts and predicting what number they will choose, then you generally don't want to pick that number unless you have priority over them. There are better fillers than this avoid what others are going to do card game.

RATING: 2
Simple set collection mixed with push your luck. What makes this game unique is all players simultaneously play a card that denotes which reward they want. If you are unique, you get the reward. The problem is, though, there seems to be very little reason to choose one reward over another. They all contain a collection of goods to collect. Making a unique choice feels random in a way that lessens the meaning of the decisions. If the game had a mechanic where you could easier tell what location others would want, the card play would be more interesting. As is, the game does not create enough interest.

Del mismo autor de "felix el gato encerrado" y "el casero", llega este juego, en la misma linea (filler, chiquitito, baratito, con una tematica original, pero con mecanicas muy bien resueltas). 

En este juego somos "chatarras" que compramos y vendemos trastos (teles, radios, sillones, etc). nuestro objetivo es conseguir trastos y "combinarlos" con unas cartas comunes para todos los jugadores de "objetivos", que son las que proporcionan los puntos para ganar la partida. 

Partidas rapidas, con cierto nivel de interaccion, una jugabilidad sencilla y fresca...

En resumen, un muy buen filler. Top10 del genero.

Lately it seems like I'm playing a lot of simultaneous action selection games.  I'm really enjoying the mechanic and it shines in Unexpected Treasures.  I also love the addition of new "treasures" into the landfill each turn based on how many icons appear on goal cards.  Oh, I also really like how the goal cards inform you of how many more points you make by turning in your trash to make the goal.  Just an awesome little game.

Friedemann is hit or miss and this one misses the mark by a lot. The only reason rescuing a rating of 4 for it is the remainder of influence by educated guesses that will help to beat a pure random strategy during the simultaneous action/card selection where players aim to choose a card nobody else chooses. The most annoying part is the tie breaker solution which depends on an initially randomly selected rank. The winner gets to perform his action, the loser gets nothing and changes rank with the winner. In our four player game I started in the lowest rank and always lost the tie breaker against the player ranked exactly one rank higher. In sum, I lost 4 out of 5 tie breakers. The other three players together lost 3 tie breakers. One of the most annoying game experiences.

A surprisingly fun light game with some fun stealing. There's a lot of back and forth and potential for some laughs. It's true that there's absolutely nothing original about the game, but the speed of play and lighthearted mood make it a winner.

RATING: 6
A largely unremarkable role-bluffing card game with a little unnecessary fiddliness and a bit of a lazy application of theme. (Radio sets being a "wildcard" that you can use in place of a table, lamp, chair or television very, very nearly makes sense.) Using numbered tokens to break role ties and having tied players swap tokens afterwards is a neat mechanic.

A great filler. Players collect sets and then turn them in to fulfill certain collection cards worth VPs. Each round everybody simultaneous plays a blind bid card telling how many "treasures" you want to take from the pool. 

There are three caveats: 
a) if two players play the same card then only the player with the best priority token takes from the pool. They then switch priority tokens 
b) players take treasures in descending order (so the player who gets the most chooses last)
c) there's also a thief card, that when played can steal a total number of treasures, from untied players, equal to the number of successful bids on the table.

----- Preliminary thoughts -----
The basic mecanic is based on Get Bit! Then Unexpected treasures add the different tokens and the collections mechanics.

As in Get Bit!, the games revolves about second-guessing the other players, but Unexpected Treasures adds a bit more depth to it, but still keeps the game simple enough for a filler.

I see 2 possible issues:
-> games with 5-6 players can become very chaotic
-> it doesn't seem to be a game deep enough for half an hour (and remember we're repating the same turns over and over). But probably you can discard some of the cards to make it shorter.

First impression (5 players) : I'd rather play Felix - The cat in sack from same designer than this.

Why the f**k did they reprint this game? The way to get the first-player token, which MEGA-important in this game, is just ridiculous: you just randomly draw a player-order token at the start of every turn :s Why not add a card that lets you take a player-order token or a simple rule as 'the player who got the most tokens in the previous round go's last'? It would eliminate a lot of frustration for me I think.

This isn't a deep game by any means and may play slightly long for what it is, but I really like Unexpected Treasures. I enjoy the theme of scavenging scrap from the junk yard to sell or "furnish your own home." I like the blind bidding, the burglary shenanigans, the tie breaking mechanism and just love the simple but pleasing integration of theme in this game.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Played once with 4P. Unexpected Treasures has a unique theme where players are dumspter divers who pick up unwanted items and sell them off. Its core mechanism is bidding for turn order - players who choose to go earlier have a wider range of choices, but can only pick up limited items. 

The twist is that players bid blindly, and clashing with another player for turn order means that the player with lower priority has to forfeit the turn. The consolation for forfeiting the turn is that the player can exchange priority markers with the player he clashed with, which makes it more likely for him to take priority the next time he clashes with another player. The mechanism for bidding for turn order is strongly reminiscent of Grimoire, where there are penalties for clashing. A simple and straightforward filler game.

There's some signs of a good game here; everything is very simple and clean and there are a few design/publishing choices that show that some thought has gone in to the game (such as the speed also being how many items you can take, the 'contracts' showing the point differential versus the individual items), but it just felt that there weren't enough varied or interesting choices to be made.

Overwhelmingly the best thing to do was to try and finish a contract and never have any spare items left over going in to the next round. There also seemed to be too many choices of vehicle which all seemed a little samey so predicting what someone else was going to pick became almost impossible in most cases.

I really dislike how the tiebreakers work out for this game in practice.  I would also guess that in a 5-6 player game, the person that randomly starts with the 1 will probably win ~25-50% more often than the player getting the lowest number will, which is pretty horrifying (though the same is true of Dominion without equal turns, I suppose).

Unexpected Treasures has a cute theme and some clever mechanisms that fit the 'dumpster dive and sell at the flea market' concept very well. There is a nice little bluffing/push your luck aspect in deciding who gets first pick of the trash, which is well executed and ends up being the primary form of interaction between players. Yet it's only fun for a game or two before it gets repetitive. There is absolutely no rise in tension between turn one and turn eight. Just the same little mini-game, over and over.  I realize it is meant to be a filler game, but even among filler games, the good ones have an arc. This one doesn't...

Some kind of Adel Veplicht light, but too random for our group.

Interactive card auction game to flip junk furniture from old waste collection for profit. Each player has a hand of 0 to 5 value bid cards. Highest bidder gets first pick of the garbage. Last gets the rest. Clever tie breaker system to swap tie value tokens. 0 value thief can steal other players garbage.

Surely a classic mistranslate like 'Remember Gift Shop'. Were they searching for 'Hidden Treasure' or similar I wonder. I love it when things like this happen.

There are a number of games where players use cards to choose numbers or roles simulaneously, and then something special happens if players pick the same card. Examples: Raj, Get Bit!, Hoity Toity, Basari, Worm Up, and Unexpected Treasures. 

In these games, the players who select the same card typically cancel each other out and don't get to do anything.  Here, in Unexpected Treasures, there's a tie-breaker so that one of the players gets to do [i]something[/i].

Get Bit! is the best of the games listed above, since player pieces are physically torn apart by sharks.

Basari forces players to bid for the selected action when they tie, which is awesome.  A close second.

Worm Up is a race between wiggly, slippery round pieces. Nice.

Raj has no theme whatsoever, but is still better than the other two.

Unexpected Treasures has a theme that's worse than no theme at all (junk collection), and is mildly entertaining.

Hoity Toity should come with a suicide note so that frustrated players who want to kill themselves can get right to it, without first having to dig up pen and paper.

A simple set collection card game in the same vein as Hoity Toity and Sneaks & Snitches... it's filler really, HT is more charming and S&S is a tick deeper...

It's simultaneous "action" selection, with the dreaded mechanism that punishes people for choosing the same thing; however, one of them still gets to go, and the tiebreakers flip between them… and it's a light game, so it actually didn't bother me.

It's okay, filler that will come out in the rotation ever now and then

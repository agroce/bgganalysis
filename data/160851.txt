RATING: 5
It's a cross between Splendor and Suburbia, two games I rather dislike, but this rises above that as it seems to take the more interesting bits and leave the rest so far. There is tile laying (with a hand this time!) which causes activations based on adjacency including a lag benefit to your opponent(s). The reward being cards which you operate like Splendor except they are true expenditures instead of an engine. Trade those cards in for points, wash, rinse, repeat. The real appeal here after 4 games at 2p is more than just point grabbing/efficiency is one of optimal blocking. For that reason alone, I think that it will do better at lower player counts but I'd like to try it at 3 and 4. I find judging what side I want to lay a tile on based on what the other player has and how this opens up choices for them (ala the Puerto Rico/Glory to Rome phase selection strategy of margin optimization, not turn optimization). The downside in particular is the game setup is too long for what the game provides if you're not playing with a full compliment of 4p.

Two super positives; one of the best rulebooks I've seen (on par, if not slightly better than Sekigahara) and a rather colorful game while playing.

Kickstarted - Available June 2015 (should be shipped early, April 2015)

Played a prototype version after the Kickstarter funded, where we playtested the 2 player version of the game. I was very excited to try it out and it was as good as I had expected it to be. Can't wait to see the final version and bring this to the table with a full complement of 4 players. But it is good to know that this is also an excellent 2 player game (since so many of my gameplays are just me and my wife).

UPDATE 2-15-15: Played it again over the weekend. Randy had a brand spanking new copy that we got to try out. The final tiles and cards look great. We got to play a 4 player game and it played really fast. Three of us tied at 45 (with a favor token deciding the victor) with last place being only 2 points back at 43. Sounds like we will be getting this before the June 2015 Kickstarter estimate, which is awesome. I think this is going to be played a LOT this year.

RATING: 6.8
Best with 3-4 players. Tile laying. You have to pay attention to what cards you are giving to other players so you don't make it easy to just get the first one-of-a-kind exchange for 10 points, etc. The scores end up very close together which is nice for new players I think [they don't feel too far behind] but frustrating to actually overcome whoever is in first.

[i]tl;dr - this light filler is a nice mix of Tokaido and Carcassonne (two of our favorite gateway games), but isn't really exceptional in any way.[/i]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

Lanterns is a beautiful, light tile layer that my wife really enjoys (good thing, I bought it specially for her!). The strategy is not brain-burning at all, but the set collection makes for a fun competition as you try to grab the honor tokens for more points. In two players it's a bit deterministic and if you can stay ahead of the other player you will always be grabbing the more valuable tokens. The game plays well with three and best at four.

As I've played more, and at higher player counts, the game doesn't impress me as much as it did before. I DO really like that you have a hand of three tiles, but I DON'T like that the winner will be determined by the first player to get lucky and claim the 10-point tile. Maybe I need to play more often, but usually in my games that's determined the winner and that bites a little bit. 

Overall, there are other light games I'd rather play instead -- we sold this one.

RATING: 8
Lanterns is one of my gateway games of choice. It is so simple that I can literally tell people at a game night to learn it from the instructions (or explain it to them in under 5 minutes while players in another game are taking their turn), and yet it is a deeply satisfying experience that teaches the mechanisms of tile-laying, set collection, and predicting other's actions (through the dedication system). There is a bit of a luck element in the tile draw that balances the game a bit for newer players, but largely it's a game of laying tiles to maximize returns for yourself while depriving competitors of cards they need and not opening up huge opportunities for someone who might be in possession of a lucky tile. New players tend to be charmed by Lanterns and seasoned players like it as a filler. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
3 plays / 2,3 players

LIKE: Zen experience. Players get a card almost every turn, keeping them engaged. Some strategy. Scarcity of lantern cards adds some tension.
DISLIKE: Very light, not a lot of tension. Didn't feel competitive to get points, I may remove even more point tiles to see if that helps.

OVERALL: Thought my wife might enjoy this one and she does but feels Carcassonne has more tension. I think this may play better with more players because of increased competition for the point tiles (no, still too many point tiles available. may remove one of each stack).

SOLD. Not enough tension.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
It's a tile laying game that is balanced too much. I don't think you'll ever see separation of scores by more than a handful of points. That may seem like a good idea, but it makes the outcome not terribly interesting. It is pretty, it is smooth and this adds up to a good experience. But it doesn't stand out in any way to me. So rather average.

Simple, breezy play.  You can play it casually or more competitively.  And it's pretty short too.  In the same vein as [b]Splendor[/b], but even simpler.  If anything, the colors on the tiles aren't always easy to tell apart, but there are shapes to go by.

RATING: 6
Fun game, although not ideal that screwing over other people is so powerful.  A three player game was won because one player got repeatedly left out of getting lanterns while another player couldn't get the right lantern colors for the big point dedications, so the third player won by a small but clear margin.

Would play again, but wouldn't need to own.

Might be better if played in a non-cutthroat manner, perhaps having dual lives as a kid's game and as a vicious game?

Wasn't interested in this game AT ALL, but turned out to fill a few minutes beautifully. I like the tiles a lot and it reminds me of dominoes a bit. Definitely captured the Chinese Lantern Festival idea. This won't ever be a top 5 game for me but it will be one I bring to the table or nightstand often. Must get the expansions!

1st play: Roughly splendor level complexity and a very appealing board as you progress through the game. The tile draw can feel a bit random, which probably evens out over time. The game doesn't stand out over Splendor enough to to feel like I need to own it. 

2nd play: After playing the game a second time and playing the platform tiles correctly the game is a little better than the first play but overall not much different than Splendor but prettier to look at.

This game plays itself. Allows for the players to talk over the game, similar to dominoes. It feels like you are making meaningful decisions, but there are usually only one good choice for your tiles. There is a bit of King Making in the game as well. This game should be a light, stress free game. As a player who is always intent on winning, this game is more stressful than it should be.

RATING: 6.2
Lanterns is fun, but not as fun as I thought it would be from the people who convinced me to get it.  It's hard to explain because it has a lot of things I like in games.  I think my problem has to do with repetitiveness, luck of the draw, and a lack of choices.  To sum them all up in one statement, the whole game is just playing the best tile in the best spot that you have available to you.  If you draw bad tiles, you're out of luck.  You can stare and stare at the board for places to get more colors to match, which draws it out.

There are some ways to mitigate the luck.  First, if you focus the early game on getting tokens, you can buy the colors you want later.  Second, you can TRY to set yourself up for future turns, but again, you need tiles that cooperate with you, and other players will have a chance to, unwittingly, mess up your plans.  

I never mind playing though.  Other people around me like the game more than I do, and I have a good time playing it, but I'm never the one to suggest it.

Only played a couple of times, but each time it went much longer than the 30 minute listed time (like 90-120 min!. I suspect we are overthinking every turn).  If it were actually a 30 min game I might give it a higher rating, but I don't find it to be a mentally satisfying experience for the time investment.

In Lanterns: The Harvest Festival, players have a hand of tiles depicting various color arrangements of floating lanterns, as well as an inventory of individual lantern cards of specific colors. When you place a tile, all players (you and your opponents) receive a lantern card corresponding to the color on the side of the tile facing them. Place carefully to earn cards and other bonuses for yourself, while also looking to deny your opponents. Players gain honor by dedicating sets of lantern cards — three pairs, for example, or all seven colors — and the player with the most honor at the end of the game wins.

A decent tile laying game perhaps a bit counterintuitive in that presumably to play this game well, skillfully, you must study the other player's card collections and try to give them colors that they do not need, while giving yourself the maximum number of colors you do need.  

The resulting game is an interesting concept in tile laying, but I am not sure it translates into a fun experience.  In particular, I was unable to sense or experience any theme, or connection between my tile placements and a simulation or theme of anything, meaning, of course, that this is very much an abstract.

In Lanterns you place tiles to collect different colors of cards in order to collect victory points from different types of set collections. But the unique concept is that each side of those tiles have different colors that will face the other players. So when you place a tile you have to be sure it benefits you (if you play one color adjacent to the same color you get a bonus card of that color) more than the other player(s). A cool mechanism.

Overall, an enjoyable but simple game that manages to create a healthy amount of tension. Much of the interest/depth in the game lies in the fact that you need to focus on your opponents in order to make thoughtful decisions (each tile placed effects every player differently). When looking at the complexity/depth of this game, it is very much in the same vein of Splendor... but with tile-placement and an emphasis on set-collection.

Yangtze is a little nice tile laying game about setting up a lantern festival, apparently inspired by some sort of Chinese traditional festivity.
During each turn, players place a tile and collects colored lantern cards, then turning these lantern cards to victory points by fulfilling scoring cards.
The mechanics and scoring are super simple, and the game is definitely aimed to a casual/family crowd, but it works as a filler even for seasoned gamers.

Mooi spel: kleurrijke kaarten en tegels, in de stijl van Hanabi.
Klein gelukselement: welke tegels je krijgt... maar toch, interactie met de medespelers is key.

Je legt tegels aan, en krijgt lampion-kaarten in functie van hoe je de tegel legt.
Daarna spaar je voor 7 verschillende lampionnen, 4 dezelfde, of 3x2 dezelfde.
Maar o wee, als je later komt dan de andere speler, krijg je minder punten.

Is zeer eenvoudig, maar kan erg tactisch gespeeld worden.

I remember playing the prototype last year when it was about gardening and players were seeking bouquets of flowers.  While the theme has changed (I must say this newer theme is certainly more comely), the game play remains largely unchanged--this is a good thing!

I think my favorite thing about Lanterns is that its game play is flexible and can accommodate multiple play styles.  One one end, you have a very relaxing game with a great presentation, wherein players don't think about the goals of their opponents and simply focus on  playing tiles and getting the cards you need; on the opposite end, you have a more tense experience with a great presentation, wherein players focus on snatching up cards until those supplies are exhausted, and then placing tiles in such a way that opponents are unable to benefit.

No matter how you go about playing it, Lanterns is a mostly relaxing and stress-free game that speeds up the set collection by throwing players cards on every single turn.  And did I mention that it had a great presentation?

An interesting visual design, and the 'tile laying without matching' mechanism is interesting, but the gamplay is lacking. At best, Lanterns is a perfect information game where you are able to observe what your opponent(s) needs to obtain a favor tile, and play in such a way as to further your own goals of obtaining favor tiles of marginally more value than your opponent's. Which is hardly more than a glorified spreadsheet optimization problem. I have {X} set, my opponent has {Y} set, and {Z} set of favor tiles are available; therefore I should take action {A} to maximize my payout and minimize my opponent's payout. Mechanically, the game works. but is not fun. With more players, I can only imagine the sense of control diminishes, in which case each player is just placing tiles and scoring occasionally without any meaningful degree of control over their end result. A bit like Tsuro, but with a false appearance of depth. Lanterns offers hardly any interesting decisions or strategic play, and yet requires too much (uninteresting) thinking to be a good casual game.

Lanterns is a simple game that is surprisingly thinky. I had been watching this game from afar since it's development days, and finally pulled the trigger for Chinese New Year. Suffice it to say, I like the game. However, I don't know that the payoff for how much thought it involves is strong enough to have me reaching for it often. After 1 play, no one is asking for it, if that's any indication. I will introduce it to a few more groups before entertaining the idea of shelving it for good.

Nice and fast family game. It's good that there are shapes and colors: makes game colorblind-friendly and more attractive in general. Every tile can be added to board without any problems and every move gives more or less profit. A lot depends on actions of other players (we get profits also during their turns).

A nice alternative in tile laying to Carcassonne, the scoring is simpler (assuming you're playing with farmers), actions are just as streamlined, and turns are often more about the best move you can make, rather than trying to mess with other players.  Fast enough that you can play multiple games back to back, without too much fatigue and with minimal resetting.

This game sits firmly in the wheelhouse for me and my gaming group. It's easy to learn, plays fairly quickly, and is beautiful to look at. The fact that there's some definitive strategy lying beneath it makes it truly satisfying.

Players place tiles hoping to match up sides to get some bonus cards, but every tile placed will give every player a card if they're available. Trade in sets of cards for one of three types of scoring tiles. Sounds easy, but you'll still be scratching your head plotting your best move.

Such a pleasure - highly recommended as a gateway game or a filler for a long evening.

Pretty and spatial. One play was only enough to scratch the surface; I can't tell whether it's deep or mostly tactical this-turn-optimization.

I refuse to record a play. It will show up in my banner and I do not want to look at a picture of this title.

This is smaller than Pastiche and quite similar, but more simple and less fun to play.

Not that Pastiche will knock you over with fun.

I'd sell it. It isn't good.

The rating will decrease when I rescore this rankings list based on its entirety stepping down by .08. I will guess it to settle for now around a 4/10 but then continue to decrease as I rank more games.

Kickstarter. Arrived early.

I love this game.  Lanterns is a light, quick, tile-laying game.  It's easy to explain the rules to newbies.  And it looks so pretty on the table in play.

It's a relaxing game but it's clever enough to get you thinking and to make it fun.  It has an appropriate fairly short playing time.

It's an interesting twist that each tile placed will also benefit your opponents.  You need to help yourself as much as possible but not your opponents!  Receiving Lantern cards on your opponents turns also feels like there is less downtime between your own turns.

And, oh, did I mention that the artwork on the components is beautiful?

Reason why it's not so high as something like Carcassonne, another tile laying game, is the seer randomness of Lantern Cards that you accumulate. With this you have less control over what you do really.

Tile laying game. Objective: collect cards (7 colours) to buy points with 3 types of card sets (7 different colours, 3 x 2 of same colour, 4 same colour). Cards are obtained by laying down tiles (4 sides each have particular colour). When laying down a tile 1 side must match colour of tile on the table. For each the player obtains a card of that colour plus the colour of the side pointing in his direction. The non-active players receive a card of the colour on the side pointing in their direction.

A beautiful & well-designed strategy game. All players are involved on every turn due to the nature of the 4-sided tiles that grant color cards that correspond to where the players sit around the table.

Easy-to-explain and nice-looking game that would be perfect for families if it weren't limited to four players. The scoring is nothing new: you're acquiring cards to fulfill the requirements of tiles (cards of seven different colors, four cards of the same color, etc.), which in turn provide victory points. The way you obtain those cards is the most interesting aspect of the game.

Decent family-style tile-laying game. Really needs 4 players to shine, 3 players is okay, 2 players is a bit dull.

I like that everyone is always getting stuff even while not their turn. It adds a decent element of needing to keep an eye on what you're giving your opponents. The descending point values of each dedication also give this game a good 'racing' feel.

My biggest gripe is that you need the full player count. Since every other players turn gives you stuff, 2 and 3 player counts seem to make dedications harder to attain.

I've heard great things about this game and I've been looking forward to playing it for over a year, but it did not strike a chord with me.  There was a lot of fiddly set-up and accounting on every turn for game play that didn't feel very deep. Maybe I'll see more in it the next time I play, but I'm not hopeful.  As a gamer, the central concept of doing the math to turn the least amount of cards into the most amount of points is something I've grappled with many times in the past, so I'm probably a bit jaded.  

But if I can use this game to get people hooked into my hobby, then I'll grow to like it a lot more, so there is still hope for this game to find a place in my collection...

The more I think about this game, the less I like it. It really seems unbalanced. At first I thought that starting later has a slight advantage because you might match colors on two sides on a tile as first, instead of one, but this really depends on your luck.

The first player has such a huge advantage as the first player will be, in a lot of cases, be the one to grab the first VP-card, meaning that you will get more points. But all the other players can be first in another type of VP-card you think? Firstly, there are only 3 types of VP-cards and secondly, the amount of work needed vor them is unequal. One takes 8 points for 4 cards (2pt/card) and another 10 points for 7 carads (1,42pt/card). Moreover, it is easier to get 4 of the same cards as you can get that in 2 turns if you play clever. Only in the end, the other VP-cards get more interesting as you try to finish up all your cards.

The way you play seems interesting at first when you hear that everybody gets a card on everybody's turn (not only their own turn), but card-denying (when a a certain color is not available anymore) happens seldom. So it feels more like "I have to give everybody else a card, let's see what they don't need." which most of the time will make these these choices be like "I have to hinder myself in order to hinder somebody else", because it is more based on the luck of what tiles you have in your hand, instead of smart play.  Decisions feel quite obvious this was.

Also, this game looks bad. The lanterns don't like lanterns, but like abstract symbols. I never had the feeling I looked at lanterns in a top-down view. That coupled with the fact that it is really obvious that every tile like 4 broken triangles makes the feel of lanterns of flowing on a lake not working. I like tile-plavement games, because at the end you feel like you made a whole landscape (Carcassonne) or went through something elaborate and complicated (Tsuro), but when I was done with a game, Lanterns looks like a confusing wallpaper or walltiles. I guess the shapes (arrangement) are there for colorblind-friendliness, but it doesn't make the game prettier.

Another "watched on TableTop" game purchase. This one is perfect for a conversational game, meaning one where you can sit around the table and have a conversation while playing that isn't about the game. There definitely seems to be a "go last" advantage here though. Not sure if it's the way we've ended up playing, but going last has lead to victory every time so far.

Maybe we need to learn to play more defensively...

Excellent game. Got the kickstarter one as a game to play with family that isn't as big of a fan of board games. I have yet to play it with anyone that hasn't enjoyed it, both those who are into upperlevel board games and more simple ones.

It's a very zen feeling game, everyone is calm and collected and there has not (yet) been trash talking during a game.

A very pleasant and simple family game with nice graphical presentation.   Set collection where you either want a run of 7 colors, 3 pairs, or 4 of a kind.   Good production and outstanding customer service.   After a few plays, I think my main criticism would be the scoring.   Scores in this game are going to be very close no matter what you do.   There is only one point difference between being first or second in a scoring category.   Still, this is very approachable and something I can play with non-gamer family members.

Nice, relaxing game.  It's a sort of combo game, trying to get the most out of a given play by matching colors on the tiles you are playing, combined with a set collection game.  It's not the best game I've played, by a long shot, but it is very enjoyable and will keep and play again.

I respect this game for what it is, but it's simply not for me. The game is rated 1.59 on weight, but it surprisingly can lend itself to AP, especially late in the game when you can play on a number of different tiles. If this happens, there is excessive downtime for other players. Unlike Jaipur, there is no real urgency to make a dedication as the point values of the tiles do not drop precipitously, meaning that scores are very close throughout and you are always left to wonder if your strategy is working. Plus, the randomness of the tile placement can mess up your strategy. Too many negatives for me to want to play again. Might work better as a two or three-player experience.

What you draw has way too much impact on what you can do.  Also, the scoring is too close for this type of game- basically the game plays you until the last turn where everyone decides who to help win(restricted by the tile in their hand).  I do really like the wood coins, though.

RATING: 8
Love it! It's simple to explain and play. I've found that over time, my gameplay has become more complex. Possibly this is because I play the Lanterns app a lot (which I highly recommend). In any case, I still really enjoy the game. 
Lanterns was one of the first modern board games I played so it has a special place in my heart. I've played with the expansion on the app and have mixed feelings - it adds complexity for sure, and some interesting mechanics, but there's something about the simplicity of the original game that I just really love too.

2017-07-02 Edit: I now prefer to play with the expansion and find the base game a bit boring by itself.

Beautiful looking game but far too complicated for what it tries to achieve. The pattern laying plus card collection in order to score victory point cards add one layer too much for my taste. Especially as the scoring cards are too close in value so that it is more a matter of number of cards spent.

The game "M" achieves all of this much better, less complicated and with much more fun, that Lanterns just feels obsolete in its current form.

Light enough to play with newbies, enough strategy to keep a more dedicated gamer interested, beautiful theme and components. Couldn't be happier, and I'm glad I chose this over Splendor. They're not completely interchangeable games (with Lanterns emphasizing reading other players while Splendor emphasizes engine building), but they're similar enough that I'm not sure I'd want both.

Very happy :)

It's a decent tile laying game, but little else. It really isn't that fun and felt more like an activity to get the most points. I guess the same can be said about many games in this day and age, but its the journey to get there what counts. 

Lanterns was ok but not good enough to keep in my collection.

It's an attractive game, I must say, and I liked the mechanics.

I, however, did not like the scoring, nor the descending score tiles.  I highly doubt it was accidental that the scoring was 1st player won, 2nd player came in second, 3rd player 3rd, and 4th was a very distant fourth.

You simply cannot put scoring in a way that the first player can be rewarded by turning in something the 4th player is going to turn in the exact same turn, but the 1st player is rewarded by getting 3VP more for doing the exact same thing, simply because he was the first player in the game.

I find that broken.  I have serious reservations that this won't be true more often than not.  I highly doubt a 4th player can ever win this game, and a 3rd player will struggle to win.  I predict 100 playings will show that the 1st and 2nd players win 80% if not more games.

Too bad I won't find out.

Lanterns: The Harvest Festival hits the spot for those looking for something simple or for non-gamers. The rules are quick to teach - even faster than modern classics like Ticket to Ride or Carcassonne. The design feels like it could have been ruined by the luck of the draw, but the card management and changing point values of the "dedications" (goals) add a tactical element that rewards players for optimizing at the margins. It doesn't have the complexity or depth to warrant constant play, but it works great as a family game, casual game, or palate cleanser.

Lovely to look at, easy to learn, fun to play. Have played several two player games, seems like it will probably feel different with more players.

An excellent tile-laying game that gets all players involved on every turn since they will likely get something from whatever you lay down.  Scores are always tight.

Even though this is not a co-op, it plays a bit like one. Everyone gets something each turn, which keeps players engaged throughout. And on the rare occasion that someone doesn't get anything due to a lack of cards, it's funny and makes for good banter. A good alternative to [thing=148228][/thing] for the shy/conflict-averse player. Arguably makes for an even better introduction to gaming than [thing=25669][/thing] because it is impossible to make a play that is against the rules, so it builds confidence. Plus, the mechanic that takes seating-arrangement into account as a determining factor in the game is both easy to learn (go, new gamers) and unique (go, established gamers). I'm super impressed with Lanterns!

Tile placement causing different payouts in different directions is a nice mechanic, but the best moves often seemed obvious, and the friendly swap tokens lowered the impact of any clever denial.

Lanterns is a beautiful game of creation. Through out play you will be laying out tiles to match the current festival state. but beware for every tile you lay also benefits everyone else. 
If you haven't played Lanterns yet then you are doing yourself a disservice. Its a wonderfully rendered game full of strategy. It is a very straightforward game of tile laying, with a deep layer of strategy in which tile to lay when to maximize your profit, and minimize your giveaway.

There is certainly nothing wrong with the way Lanterns plays, and it looks relatively nice I guess, but overall the really isn't anything right about Lanterns either. The game is completely inoffensive to everyone in every possible way. The game plays as though you are simply doing a shared activity where the things your neighbors do in said activity sometimes have a tiny effect on what you do. At least the game is shortish

This game was recommended to me because my son likes Splendor quite a bit and I was looking for another relatively simple, fairly abstract game that he might enjoy.  This fits the bill well and once again has us collecting colors though with some tile laying and a couple of different twists.

An attractive little tile-laying game that presents the players with interesting options each turn. The idea is to collect lantern cards by playing tiles and then turn in those lantern cards for points. However, the fact that there are only three ways that score points, they score similar amounts of points, and they're not too different to accomplish as far as difficulty goes, seems to indicate that the scores are always going to be very close and fall out in somewhat predictable ways. I'm sure with more plays the players will learn both how to gain more cards quicker and how to deny scoring cards to others, but I think that would change things only so much. I'll play again and hopefully be wrong, because otherwise it's not a bad game.

Basically an abstract tile placement and set collection gamr, there definitely is a decent amount of tactics despite simple ruleset here, and its repetitive play can be forgiven due to its short length, but it was too tactical for my tastes in that the board state changes too much by the time it got back to my turn at least in 4 player, which BGG says is the best player count, and outside its nice art there just wasn't snything that felt that special.

The quickest I've gone from playing a game for the first time to buying it, Lanterns is absolutely gorgeous and one of the best tile laying games I've played. The theme is great (apparently I love zen games), and the upcoming expansion fixes any viability issues with the different possible lantern exchanges, as well as adding some great new elements! It even has a few great solo variants posted on BGG, in case you're into both solo gaming and pretty games.

This is an odd sort of tile-laying game.  The idea that everyone (scarce resources pending) can benefit from each players turn is intriguing.  On the other hand, the game largely misses the point of tile-laying mechanics.  There are no restrictions to force adjacent tiles to match, only bonuses if they happen to.  You can wrangle a strategic advantage if you really wanted to, but it doesn't seem worth it for a game this light.

When gamers talk about "clean design" this is the kind of game they mean. Each turn flows easily from action to action and it all makes sense. Turns are short but you are involved, in a small way, in everyone's turn. It's one of the most relaxing games I own and a perfect "filler plus" for a game night appetizer or post big-game cool down.

Decent tile laying game with a twist. Placing tiles will also profit all other players as they draw cards therefore players must not only consider optimizing their gain but other players getting free cards.

RATING: 7
Very straightforward tile laying game that ties in set collection for scoring.  Each game will feel similar since there's nothing to help mix up game play.  Perfect for times when you just want to turn off your brain for a bit and look at pretty colors.  Offers opportunities to screw your opponents and you have to think how best to lay your tiles so it benefits you more than your opponents.  Very light filler that will be easy to teach to non-gamers.  Light on tension since racing for points is a lot gentler than in Splendor.  You'll still have a tile to grab for points, but it may be worth a point less if you're opponent beat you to it.  

If you can only have one more 30 minute filler, Splendor would be a better choice since it offers a lot more decisions for the play time.  However, if you're not short on shelf space and want some variety, then this is worth a look.  Just don't expect it to light your world on fire.

I have very similar feelings towards this that I do Musee. We all enjoy the game. It is fun and fast and has a slightly more thinky edge than Musee that is welcome as well. One of our family is extremely prone to AP and this slightly thinky edge in this game draws out this attribute and really slows the game down to the point where it is unenjoyable (for me at least ... I seem to be very sensitive to slow play snore). But that is not the game. If played quickly this is an extremely light, fun family tile laying game. Enjoyable for all generations of our family.

Previous thoughts;
Wanted to back this on kickstarter but held off due to postage costs (I'm tight like that)! Bought it retail and really enjoy it. 

Its a very light game, almost too light for gamers who like a bit of meat between their teeth. Being a herbivore I enjoy it. It's very simple and rewarding in game play. Extremely good to play with the kids as you get card rewards on every players turn. A game of efficiency and timing for cashing in your dedication tokens. Falls into the category of games I enjoy playing over a coffee (Pagoda, Musée I am looking at you).

This seems like a game where you want to put some thought in and come up with a big strategic monster-combo sort of play, but it's not.  At least, with 4 players, there's no point considering more than the very next turn.  The board will have likely changed completely by the time its your turn again, so there's no way to consider chain placement.

That makes it a little zen, but it also makes it pointless to try to plan more than your very next turn.

Tile laying and set collection--two simple mechanics which blend into a very nice game with a classic feel. I like this one quite a bit. It's a bit abstract. I'm not sure that everyone will "get it," but it's still accessible. 

Update 8/19/15:

Played this again tonight with my wife. Despite the ratings, this game does not play near as well with 2 as it does with 4. I like the game, but I'm only keeping it as a ultra-light family game to play with 3 or 4.

Simple, easy to each, good-looking filler game that really does not overstays its welcome with only 3 tiles in hand to choose from, and a board that changes a lot when it comes back to your turn. Love the limited # of cards that adds a bit tension between players when others have no cards to gain during your turn. A set collection that does not drag on. Form sets - claim points - move onto the next set. Great filler.

Played this for the first time at an open games event as a two player game against a very canny seven year old. I really quite enjoyed the game and from the way it played, with the tiles that each player places affecting other players it looks like it would probably be best with four.

So, all-in-all, a pleasant little game. I doubt I'll purchase it as it doesn't really 'scratch any itch' I have but I enjoyed the two player game and would definitely play again.

Very beautiful cards, gameplay is like Jaipur + Splendor + dominoes. A passable filler game and kid-friendly but I was bored halfway through as strategy is fairly obvious and the game drags. I wish the artwork could be ported over to Hanabi, though!

SECOND PLAY: Again, dull. My impression is that if you get the right tiles, you can just keep grabbing the 4-of-a-kind tiles every turn--they are slightly fewer points but since they take only 4 cards to fulfill rather than 6 or 7 you can score about 1.5 times faster than anybody trying for the higher-scoring dedications. -- Anyway, maybe I'm wrong, but it's such a random non-game that I'm not planning to try again anytime soon.

Fun little game that my son likes to teach.  Matching colors, shapes, finding combinations and cashing in on them before someone else does while constantly aware of the inevitability of the last card being played before final dedications  (sounds like a radio programme to me...) keeps you on your toes as you constantly trade small, well conatructed playing cards back and forth.  As much fun with 2 players as it is with 4 (which is hard to say of most games).

An entertaining game which works well with two people. I haven't played it with a larger group yet. The production value is very nice, and the game has a nice, effortless mechanic. I could see it being much more challenging with more players, potentially to the point of frustration, but with two players it's a nice social game. You don't need to focus so fully on the game, but if you choose to, there's just enough strategy to be found to keep you entertained. It's nothing revolutionary or challenging, but I don't think it's meant to be.

Pleasant, but unfulfilling.  The scores are always tight and there's very little room for skillful play.  After the first couple of rounds, people tend to acquire scoring tiles at the same rate, so the cards you collect in those opening turns are the real difference-makers.

LANTERNS  is a beautifully illustrated game where you are essentially creating a lake full of Japanese lanterns for a festival.  It’s a tile laying game and each tile has four sides of different (or the same) color.  As you lay the tile you try your best to match one of the colors.  When you lay your tile, each play receives a card of the color facing them.  The colored cards earn you “points” when you turn them in in one of several combinations. There are a few other elements, but that’s the basics. Easy to learn and teach. You are reliant on what other players laydown to give you color cards, so you can’t plan too far in advance your strategy. And while one player is thinking about where to lay their tile, there is plenty of time to chat The game can be played 2-4 players, but it really is best with four. A+

Imagine Ticket To Ride where the board is built like a jigsaw puzzle over the course of the game and each tile dictates what Train card you and you your opponents collect. You can claim Routes before you play your tile each turn. There are no Tickets and only 8 of each color of Train card. There, that is Lanterns: The Harvest Festival.

On top of being derivative of a much-loved game, L:tHF's unique aspects make the game simultaneously slower and more frustrating than TtR.

Trying to get the most out of each tile you play, while helping each opponent as little as possible, with a finite amount of resources to work with, and having to determine how to cash in your existing resources first, leads to considerable analysis paralysis.

Conversely, if playing with wily opponents, it is possible to get screwed out of collecting anything during their turns, and failing to collect even once or twice may be enough to disable your ability to compete thanks to a scoring system that basically amounts to how many Dedications (Routes) you've completed, as the value of each Dedication is only marginally important.

First player has huge disadvantage. No real different strategies. Getting tiles with platforms is huge and tiles without platforms have no balancing factors.

I really don't see the appeal of this. Putting your tile anywhere else than on the end of a single long line of tiles just benefits the next player. And even if you do put your tile somewhere else, the end scores will be very close to each other anyway.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8 -> 8)[/COLOR]

[i]Lanterns has become my favorite [i]light[/i] tile laying game and is an excellent family/gateway game. I was able to teach my then 6 year old daughter how to play except we didn't use the favor tokens to trade cards. Lanterns has held up to repeated play especially when you add the  the expansion, [thing=206244][/thing] which adds more depth to the game and helps balance out the different scoring tiles [i](the four of a kind is no longer the optimal tile to acquire)[/i]. The combination of tile laying and set collection has kept this game on the table and I don't see that changing anytime soon.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Combines two of my favorite mechanisms in gaming: set collection and tile laying.
- Pictures don't do this game justice, it looks beautiful laid out on your table.
- Great gateway/light family game, takes a few minutes to teach and plays quickly.
- Having to turn in sets before laying your tile and taking cards makes you think ahead a bit more since it's important to set yourself up for futures turns.

I originally passed this game by because I thought it's be too light. However; I love the tile laying mechanic, but a lot of the tile laying games I've played haven't really connected with me (I've tried almost every version of Carcassonne). I do enjoy Cacao quite a bit, but I think Lanterns is even better. Part of that is because my family and I really enjoy set collection games and Lanterns does a great job combining tile laying with that mechanic. 

Also, the fact that everyone potentially gets a tile every turn keeps you engaged throughout the game and keeps the game moving swiftly along. Lastly I'll mention the favor tokens you can collect which allow you to swap a card you have with one of the available cards from the supply. Since you can only do this once a turn and this happens before you place a tile you need to plan a few moves in advance which adds a light strategic element to the game. For such a simple game Lanterns manages to create a fulfilling game play experience that you'll want to continue to explore. High marks for Lanterns, I'm looking forward to introducing this one to my wife (which is saying a lot because I don't introduce many new games to her given her immense displeasure at learning new games).

Pretty but dull. First player has a distinct advantage that is not compensated for. Scoring always seemed tight and if somebody gets a scoring card you were after chances are you can get a different one for a point less, making it feel that the overall strategy was just to collect coloured cards and hope for the best.

The cards just keep flowing into your hand from other players' turns, so on your turn you spend the cards you have for VPs, and then assess the table for the best play of one of your tiles to get you maximum cards while trying not to give other players the cards they need (so they hopefully can't trade in point-scoring sets on their turn). This generates a bit of downtime unfortunately because the best play can't be determined until you know what cards you've been given from the previous player's turn. Also, the decision each turn isn't that interesting (it's just placement assessment based on what you've got) so the game doesn't quite fit the fluffy 30 minute niche nor the interesting-decisions 30 minute niche. But it's ok enough for some replay if you're ok with a fair swag of your game being handed to you by the other players, and where your turn is simply the job of filling in the gaps in what you've been given.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Nice concept, great component quality, and I really like the mechanic that whatever you do you will always give something to your opponents so you need to have a watchful eye as this is ultimately a race for VPs.

It's very simple so easy to explain and whilst the patterns aren't the nicest looking, the theme for some reason evokes something nice about it. I think it's the artwork on the cards... I quite like this one and will play it with less experienced players.

Also great app!

Played it with 3 and I really like it as a multiplayer. The expansion pushes this game up to an 8 and specially if playing with more players. Really good game.

Fun tile game!  Easy to teach!  I enjoy how you have to position your tile based on where you're sitting, in order to obtain the card you want.  And then it feels really good if you can get a combo of 3 cards and two tokens (or better) on your turn.  And I enjoy making the decision as to which point chip I want to go after (there are only three ways to score), based on the cards that I have (or think I can get).  Another distinct tile-laying game.

Lanterns is a tile-laying game in which players are trying to collect sets of lantern cards and turn them in for decreasing point values.  Each player has a hand of three tiles, and depending on where it is placed, it earns everyone a lantern card; the active player can potentially earn extra lantern cards or favor tokens. However, players can be screwed out of lantern cards if there are none of that type left.  Lantern cards can later be exchanged in three types of set--4 of a kind, three pairs, or one of each.  While the exchange values decrease as the game goes on, it feels pretty mathematical--it's easy to calculate how many points you're getting per lantern card turned in.  As a whole, I didn't really think the screwage felt right in this kind of game, and I didn't really feel like there was much of a game here anyway.

An Ok Simple tile laying game. Reminds me of playing Ingenious. The basic idea is solid but the scoring and the ability to deny others what they need and for yourself to get ahead is limited. Still need to try the expansion and see if it improves the game. Probably a good game for non-gamers, casual gamers, and kids. Ingenious might actually be a better game of this type, though personally neither really excites me nor do I find them compelling.

TOP - ONE POST REVIEW of "Lanterns: The Harvest Festival"
I am a sucker for tile placement games....and colorful games....and simple filler games that are great for the family. LANTERNS: THE HARVEST FESTIVAL has all of this. The rules for this one are simple. On your turn you must place one of the 3 tiles you have in your hand. In addition, you may be able to trade a lantern card or trade in a set of lantern cards to get a dedication token. When placing tiles you receive a lantern card for matching colors. In addition both you and your opponents receive lantern cards based on the color of the latest placed tile that is facing them. The winner is the player with the most points in dedication tokens when all the tiles are placed. It is a VERY colorful game that is fun to play and great for virtually every age.

WHO MIGHT LIKE THIS GAME? = Fans of tile placing games. Fans of family style filler games with simple rules.

WHO MIGHT NOT LIKE THIS GAME? = Those who don't like tile placement or simple games. Those who want a more strategic game. Those who want to play with more than 4 people.

This game is fine for what it is, but nothing about it grabs my interest. I think mostly I just don't like tile laying games much and there's not much to this game other than tile laying, but I also really disliked trying to look at all the other players' sets of cards with every tile I laid to try to make sure I didn't give them what they needed. Maybe it would be better as a two player game with less card counting, but nothing about the game intrigued me enough that I want to try to play it again.

I'd rather just play Carcassonne, and I don't even really like that game.

An interesting euro game of tile placing, set collection, and decreasing values in a way reminiscent of Jaipur. Overall the game works, it does what it does, and it's got some very nice euroness to it. The game itself is dry and sorta disengaging, I honestly wanted to get my tablet out to busy myself between my turns, and it's thoroughly unexciting. Certainly a good first offing by the designer, but hopefully he'll drift from such standard Euro fare to something more flashy and intricate. It plays pretty quickly though, and so it has a fair share of perks and cons.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
In Lanterns is easy to learn and a quick playing filler. In it you are trying to build sets of cards and turn them in for decreasing value victory point tokens. As you place tiles each player, gets a matching card of the color facing him (if available), the placing player is trying to get bonus actions and cards by matching to already played colors. There is an advantage to complete sets early, so you have to plan your connections. 

The cards have nice artwork and the tile look nice on the table. Since there is as a bit of strategy with it makes the game more satisfying.

When I get burned out playing the European style games, this is a great alternative. It's a slow paced game since you are not only playing your turn but also planning out your next round. But each move is important since a game can be decided by only a few points. The app is fantastic with its visuals and ease of use.

Simply elegant. Lanterns is a beautiful tile laying, set collection game that is easy to learn and fun for the entire family. each player has one side of the each tile you they associate with. When a player places a tile on their turn a player they receive a lantern card the color of which with their side of the tile, the current player receives an additional lantern card for any color to color matches. Each other player gets a lantern the color of their side of the tile. At the start of a players turn they may turn in lanterns for scoring tiles. Four of a kind, seven different colors or two pair. Great fun, beautiful to look at, always draws a crowd.

Wanted to like this more, since I enjoy simple abstract designs ("Qwirkle" as the prime example), but this one didn't thrill me. After only two games I didn't feel there's anything more to discover. Also, the nature of the game (racing for a card that gives 1 meager point more) didn't help the fact that there's almost no tension. Very, VERY family-oriented game, gamers have nothing to look for here.

This is fun. It is a nice light german style family game. It was engaging and there were interesting decisions. That said, I think that I prefer Splendor (I have also only played it once) and consider them to fit a similar length/weight niche. Splendor has a more strategic feel while this is more tactical. Some turns you have the ability to turn cards in for point tiles and sometimes you do not but other than that most turns feel basically the same. 

I would have liked the game to feature more variability. Special abilities, special goals, something that changes the rules or adds variability. Perhaps you could turn in a special goal card that was drawn at the start of the game which gives extra points for turning in a certain color or for blocking someone from getting a color card or for some other in game goal. It doesn't need to be a heavy or medium game but it could use something extra to add variety. 

I enjoyed it and would play it again. If I saw it for $10 I would consider buying it. Very decent.

A light abstract game that is one of my favorites for playing with non-gamers especially, but it is not just an intro game. It is very approachable and does not take long to teach or learn but game length will vary based on number of players. Can be played with just two players but is best with four, in my opinion, as it makes you place tiles more intentionally. The art is very nice and the overall component quality is well done. An enjoyable game that can easily make it to the table.

Tile laying.  You pick up 'colors' based on how you lay tiles (and how they match with existing tiles on the board).   You set-collect your 'colors' to achieve victory points.  OK tile laying game, but something didn't quite connect for me.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A very nicely constructed game with initially pleasing mechanisms. Ultimately, however, it is just too simplistic.

It virtually 'plays itself'. The players merely do the light mathematical chores of processing where to place tiles in order not to spawn resources that are more useful to opponents than to yourself. Rinse and repeat. As someone else here said, the whole game "flows uneventfully".

It's very Splendor-ish in that regard (but mercifully less mathy). And, like Splendor, it does have a few interlocking mechanisms to make it mildly more interesting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not bad, but I didn't feel like I had a lot of control. Most of what I did seemed fairly obvious. The score in the game was also super close (four players and we all finished within a point of each other), and so I am worried it might be a game where, no matter what you do, you get around the same score.

Por enquanto, jogado só com 2 jogadores. A mecânica de dar carta para os jogadores de acordo com qual lado do tile que fica virado pra ele é diferente, mas resultou num jogo, pelo menos com 2 jogadores, não muito empolgante, e que me parece que é decidido por questões mínimas de eficiência, mais do que por jogadas inteligentes. Ainda assim, acho que tem mais pra ser explorado, jogando-se com mais gente.

The mechanics are smooth, but there is basically no ability to plan.  Every play hands tokens to other players, but you don't know what their tiles are.  You have to play tiles and set up other players, without knowing what they have.  So, it's mostly just luck as to whether or not you get what you need, which falls a bit flat.  The game is pretty and somewhat pleasing, but there's no depth at all.

This is a cool little tile-laying game. Game play is pretty simple and straightforward but not without decisions to make along the way. Every turn is a little puzzle to figure out the best play to get yourself resources while denying others the ones they need to collect the VP chits that you are going for. But since everyone is generally collecting resources at the same rate, they collect VP chits at a similar rate. So end-game scores are pretty close, barring unusually bad luck in not acquiring cards at pace. Which means that if you don't get what you need, you can feel as if you're just being smacked around by Lady Luck! But at least it's not a long game, and it is kind of fun!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Players each have a hand of (square) tiles showing one of several possible colors on each edge, and possibly showing a platform in the center. On your turn, place a tile adjacent to another on the board, with each side oriented to face a different player (4er game). In turn order, everyone gets a resource card of the type on the tile edge facing them (if any remain in Supply). In addition, you get cards for matching edges with tiles already on the table. And, if you match platforms on tile centers of adjacent tiles, you get a favor token for each match (use pairs of tokens at start of future turns to exchange a resource card). Cards you collect are placed in a face up display. At the start of each turn, you may turn in a set of cards (various types: 3 pairs, 2 trips, etc.) and claim a VP chit from the matching pile (values decrease as you work your way through the pile). The game ends after all the tiles are played; most VP wins.

RATING: 6
This is a nice abstract filler game.  I'm not typically a big fan of abstract games but this one was pretty good.  On your turn you place a tile matching colors and based on which colors match and which direction the colors point players collect color cards.  These can be turned in for point cards once you collect a certain set.

Unfortunately while I had fun in my first play I think this game is very solvable which would take a lot out of it.  The harder to collect point totals don't give enough points over the easier to collect ones to justify how much longer it takes to get them.  Which in turn means turn order can mean the game winner based on them getting the easier to collect and higher total point cards quicker.  Because within each of these categories the quicker you collect the point cards the more they're worth.

It is a very, very pretty game as well.  It is all very abstract but with nice bright colors and familiar Asian aesthetic.

RATING: 7.5
I love tile laying, and I love this gorgeous little game. It is on the quicker side especially with two players which I like (you need some of those in your collection), it is very light on rules but still some depths in the strategy. When you place a tile you get the lantern cards you need to acquire dedications (=points) but each time you place a tile you inevitably grant your opponents lantern cards, too, and that's where you need to try and play smartly. 
"Lanterns" is one step up from a filler game (which I don't mean negatively, I think fillers are great games) and I think will go down with gamers for a light game that it is and non-gamers because it doesn't scare them with complicated rules. Love to own this now!

In a 4 player game, you only have 25% control over your fate. You're heavily dependent on players to give you what you need. In a game, they can easily prevent you from scoring points if they so choose. It's fine for a light game, but there are dozens I'd rather play instead.

Attractive but uninteresting game where placing tiles gives players cards in seven colours, which are traded in for descending points in three kinds of set (4 of a kind, 3 pairs, 1 of each colour). This is nice in theory, particularly the element where placing tiles also gives cards to opponents, which opens the game up to some minor screwage (e.g. giving opponents cards in exhausted colours). But luck of the draw seems very important (being able to place a tile to match on two sides is huge), especially given that scores are likely to be very close.

Played once with 2 players.  I enjoyed the art style, but I didn't end up being a fan of the game.  It's really tactical, and the choices are usually on the obvious side.  There are a few times when you get the chance to do something clever, but it is often because of serendipity or a mistake on the opponent's part.  I have to think that aspects of the game would be more interesting with more players, but that it would be so chaotic that I would not enjoy that much either.

A light (Ha! Because they're lanterns!), pretty tile-placement and set-collection game that still gives players something to think about. In my single play I still had to think about counting actions and got to make a blatant resource-denial play against my opponent, so I think there's a good amount of interactivity in the game once everyone's acclimated. I look forward to see what other strategy can emerge.

My biggest complaint is that the publishers didn't take an obvious lesson from Carcassonne and [i]give the starting tile a different back[/i].

A tile laying / set collection game - this one can create an aura that will enfold you in pure gaming bliss.  

Relaxing,  engaging and closely contested - this is everything you could ask for in a light weight package and more.  It will not provide you with a deep experience,  but as far as this genre is concerned,  you would be hard pressed to find better.

RATING: 5.5
This is a quite cute and simple game of laying tiles in a field, where matched edges give you bonus coloured cards, and the edge pointing toward each player gives them a standard coloured cards. Players are trying to optimally make up all-7, 3-pairs, or 4-of-a-kind scoring sets in order to grab scoring tokens from a decreasing-value stack.

The concept is cute, it's quite easy to teach, the tile-draw luck is frustrating and in the end, it feels as if there's just too much irritating churn of cards back and forth for nothing much to show for it at the end of the game. I like the various-player-direction mechanic in the abstract, but in this case, it leads to irritating levels of AP and leaves me wishing I'd brought Karat/Gardens of the Alhambra out instead.

Lanterns is a tile placement game, where you're getting cards to hand and redeeming them for point chits.

You start with three tiles. On your turn, the last thing you do is place a tile... When you place a tile, you get a card for every side where that color matches a tile it borders. When the color match involves tiles with platforms, you get a wooden disc. Additionally, every player gets a card for the color that faces him from your placed tile. There is one hiccup here though... there are only 8 cards of every color (in a four player game at least) and you don't get cards if they're not available.

But before you place a tile, you redeem a victory point chit if you can. There are three types of victory point chits. One you get for returning four cards of one color. Another you get for returning three pairs of different colors. And the last you get for returning one card in each of the seven different colors. Just before you redeem cards you can spend two wooden discs to change one card into a different color.

The victory chits are sorted into the three different types and stacked by VP value, low to high. So it's a race to redeem cards for points. But as one stack starts diminishing, the VP's on the remaining chits are no longer worth as much as the piles that haven't been diminished as much. So you'll try to take the top chit from the pile that has the highest value... which means that every person will usually get a chit that's the same or one point lower than the last one pulled. This makes for a game that, by design, has very tight scores.

The game end is triggered when the last tile has been placed on the board. Everyone has one final turn to redeem a VP chit if possible.

I liked the puzzle involved in placing the tiles in the game. There's a lot of opportunity to screw people by placing the tile so that they receive a card that isn't available, or if you do give them a card, making sure that it's one they don't want.

I didn't care for way that the score is designed to be really tight. The way you redeem tiles means that a single point, or two, is enough to make a huge difference. The consequence of that is that even a small disadvantage can be crippling. Any of a number of little things, like drawing tiles that don't work for you, drawing tiles that don't have platforms, not getting set up with a good spot to place your tile, or getting dinged when you "get" a card that isn't available, can really sink you in this game.

While I like a lot of things about this game, the scoring mechanism really left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth. But that might just be a bad first impression.

After two plays, the game is just OK for me. A bit too abstract for my taste, can lend itself to AP a little too much, and there just isn't much room to make great plays unless you just happen to have the right tile to match multiple other tiles. Still, a decent simple family game to play once in a while.

MEH. Another game with good technical gameplay that is just not fun. It kind of reminds me of Sudoku puzzles, interesting at first then it just becomes like work.

There are not a lot of games that I enjoy playing with my gaming group and my extended family but this is one of them. It's my go to game every time we have a new person show up at board game night and for every family gathering. The art work is beautiful, the gameplay is easy to explain but still interesting. I love that there is no down time, keeping people involved with every turn. 

Can't wait for the mobile app to arrive!

RATING: 6
Lanterns is an inoffensive, family-oriented game with lots of room for maneuvering and not exactly cut throat competitive. It achieves its niche for catering to the very casual gamer: Perhaps because of that, it fails to excite me and I find the game rather bland. Set collection is something I enjoy, but often, I find that my set is partially determined for me when my turn rolls around as I also accumulate cards during other turn. There is very little to do or decisions to make every turn as the choices are quite well laid out.

Overall not a bad game but there are others out there that cater to the same urge.

Feels like you can either play this heavily calculatingly trying to carefully control who you're giving what lanterns to and slowing the game to a crawl or you play a little more chaotically and it's somewhat random who wins and points will be close.

Still, enjoyable enough to play and gives you enough to think about during other players' turns that downtime isn't a big deal.

Oct 2017: Still enjoying this game when it comes out, though we have enough games that it doesn't get played as often as it did originally.  Emperor's Gifts adds some mechanics we like (favor tokens worth points, wild cards), but it is definitely not necessary to enjoy the game.

Fun, light game of tile laying and set collecting.  Great filler or gateway game.  Simple to explain, more challenging than it looks to win.  Every time I think I've figured out a strategy, someone still ends up beating me.  I've yet to win, but that doesn't stop me from loving this game!

(May 2015) - After 1 3p game - This is a nice 30 minute filler that can be played casually or more cut throat.   You do have a hand of 3 tiles, but some luckier placements will help you acquire more cards/favor tokens.   Cards are limited (hand size limitation too at beginning of your turn) so you can add some "take that" if you orient the tile so your opponents don't get a card(s) on your placements.

Pretty finishing board layout.

My 6 rating is based on the fact that probably this game could be good with young players and non-gamers.
As a gamer, I would say "it works", but not much more than this... my feelings are this is a 5. What's the purpose of discs, really? where's the tension? Are there meaningful decisions? not many. It's bland, it flows uneventfully.

I have only played this game once, but it is a fun set collection game with a unique tile laying mechanism  used to determine the color(s) of lanterns each player collects. Players stay engaged because you are collecting lanterns on each players turn, and are continually adjusting what their goals are based on other players choices. It is very quick and I would imagine easy to teach.

I don't see why people like this game.  You place a tile and you're pretty much guaranteed to get 2 lantern cards every turn, so there's essentially no way to get ahead of other players.  This means everyone can afford the point tiles at the same time, so whoever goes first is likely to win.  A strategy of only giving yourself what you want and not helping the other players is impossible, or at the very least so time consuming that the other players would slap you in the face for taking an hour thinking about where to place one of your 3 tiles.  The theme is meh and the game is meh.

A quick, charming tile layer.  The basic set collection is pretty straight forward, but there are layers to the tile laying beyond simply looking for the best bonuses as you want to not give your opponents exactly what they are looking for while perhaps setting up tiles in such a way as to encourage them to give you what you want.  I'd probably get my own copy if I didn't have a glut of games I already love in this weight class and time frame.

Classic dice and charts baseball game. I played many games until I started playing the computer version which is great (and better for season replays). It's a religion as much as a game. Catholic or Protestant? APBA or Strat? I probably like APBA a bit better as a system with those magical numbers and I prefer the more standard card size. But Strat-O-Matic *feels* like baseball when you play a single game and there's much less chart referencing than either APBA or Statis Pro.

Not a big sports fan, but a friend in middle school was wildly into this for a bit.  We both purchased copies and my brother used to run whole seasons, as he was a sports statistics nut.  Kind of interesting, but felt very random and lost its appeal.

[2] I have the 2004 edition components and box with every hall of fame player card through 2010 as well as their 'baseball heroes' card set. I play this solo at the basic level so far and am really into it. This is an amazing simulation even at the basic setting and I can't wait to live with it a bit longer.

I'm in the process of developing a more elaborate ballpark board for the game and can't wait for the finished product to add to the experience! Something I'll be playing for the rest of my life! 

Edit: and here's the final result:

RATING: 8
The game is in the baseball hall of fame for a reason.  The elegance and simplicity of this game are amazing.  It plays fast and logical.  It caputures extreme nuances of baseball, such as the lefty-vs-righty match-ups and the range of a shortstop versus his accuracy (error).  The two are not necessarily one in the same: you can have a guy who never makes an error, but can't cover much ground (thus turning potential outs into base hits).  And the game is played on player cards with only a few charts, and it plays in about 30 minutes.  It's probably the most perfect sports game ever made - especially in terms of realism vs. fun factor, however, I rate the basketball game as the 2nd best game overall of all games.  The only reason I give it an 8 is that I am not as much of a baseball fan as I am a basketball fan.

Seasons I have in cards:
1927
1950
1961
1970
1986
1988

I also have the playoff teams from 1962-77 and a hall of famer collection.

Any for trade or sale.

RATING: 7.93
Because almost every play involves a single die roll, a good knowledge of the workings of how a RL baseball game unfolds helps with the enjoyment of the game.

If one allows himself to simply read the result and not visualize what is happening on the field, it can become tedius, especially solo, because there isn't a pitch-by-pitch build-up to that result.

The same can be said for having up-to-date knowledge of the current players, knowing their hitting, fielding and pitching styles and even having a familiarity with their physical appearance.

RATING: 6
Quite realistic (and undoubtedly the best of its kind) despite a few design flaws (e.g., there are far too many "single - advance two bases" results; the center fielder has far too many meaningful throws vs. left and right fielders), lack of excitement, and dearth of what I'd call "charm." 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Probably the best sports simulation game on the market.  The rules are fairly easy to get through, and the amount of detail (especially if you play the super advanced game) is rather impressive.

This is definitely a game I'd recommend playing in a league for.  Drafting players at the beginning of the year, and trading throughout the year really adds a lot of enjoyment to it.

Also, the game plays extremely well solitaire- allowing play by mail leagues to be a preferred way to play.

RATING: 6
you can get this for $16.50 with 5 teams by phoning strat-o-matic and asking for a "selector set".  i've only played the basic game, with little chrome.  the system works.  i'd like to incorporate a number of things from the advanced ruleset, but the super advanced stuff looks ridiculous.  i'd also like to explore playing with minis, baseball cards, or some other physical representation of the players.  rating could rise if i play it again.

I didn't know what to expect with this game.  It's fun, and does a nice job simulating baseball.  Lots of randomness and lots of charts to flip through, but some good tactics involved in deciding who to play when and where.  I'd like to play some more to get more of a feel for the flow - perhaps a short season.

Classic baseball simulator. What baseball fan wouldn't want to test a lineup with Babe Ruth versus a pitching staff with Randy Johnson?

Yes, it is a dice rolling "luck" fest. However, this is pure dice rolling done right. Admittedly, a large part of the draw is the historical/contemporary baseball players. If "Babe Ruth" was replaced with "Herman Bambino", this game would not be rated nearly as high.

1997 Strat-O-Matic Baseball All-Stars
Box is solid and in fairly good condition with some shelf wear (especially on the edges), and it does dish to the center a bit due to how long the box is.  Otherwise the box is sound.  Inside are the following:

*A small brown bag with 4 small red pawns and 3 dice (2 red and 1 smaller white) therein
*Basic fielding chart
*A business size sheet on which the rules are printed (original)
*Eight Pitcher's Hitting Cards (still unpunched)
*A large card with the Strategy Chart on one side and the Advanced Strategy Chart on the other
*Four Form A scoring sheets
*Six Form B scoring sheets
*Large field card with the baseball diamond printed on it
AND
*All 62 All-Star Color Photo Game Cards...UNPUNCHED.

As far as I can tell, the game is complete and in unplayed condition.  A great find for all you baseball buffs out there.

Fun on those wintry days when there is no real baseball to watch or play.  Game generates very realistic results and accurately reflects the kind of decision making that big league managers have to face.  If you like that kind of decision making and baseball in general, this is a really great game (for baseball fans this game rates a 9).  Great 'simulation' but can players can become disengaged once the fundamental decisions (lineup, starting pitches, etc.) have been made.

Strat was a huge part of my youth, spent countless hours playing solo and in draft leagues with friends starting in 1970.  I haven't played in years though since I'm not interested in modern baseball; if I did play it would be with one of the retro sets.  I would still like to play but I have a limited amount of gaming time and hockey board games are my top priority.

RATING: 6
A very fun game that includes three versions in which the gamer can choose to play.  The basic system has some flaws in it (i.e. no hit batters and hitters that don't hit homers having an ability to do so on results off pitchers cards) but the advanced and super advanced versions replicate the sport of baseball quite well.  Ranks high as a fun game that is quite playable but statistically it can't measure extreme statistics such as batters with low walk or strikeout rates or pitchers that allow few walks or home runs (the short coming of any baseball game simulation that uses the 50/50 split between batter versus pitcher/defense type game engine).  Problem could be solved through the use of an over ride but the company seems reluctant to do so.  The Basic Game could have inputted hit by pitches for hitters but never did either so it makes me wonder about the commitment on the part of the designer to go that extra mile to provide the customer/gamer a more complete package.

Great game if you're a hard core baseball fan.  Takes a while to set up and get figured out but then it's a blast.  Actually played it during a World Series game and was amazed how often our result was then mirrored an inning or so later in the actual game!  Super realistic and super fun.  But this is not for the casual fan.  You need to be a big time baseball geek to get into this.

I like how much detail is used to represent every stat and game situation.  If you played through a whole season this way, I am sure you would recreate each player's stats within error.  The problem with this game is that first, the visual representation of baseball is poor.  There really is not enough flavor for the expense of the game. And secondly, you have to play last season over again, instead of feeling like it is a new season.  Releasing teams just prior to the new season with their new players and rules for simulating up and down years would put this over the top.  If it didn't take the normal game company forever to put anything together, this would be a fantastic reality.  You just have to print out cards and rules.  Why does it take 9 months to do that?  It must be the manufacture of the wonderful red plastic pegs they give you for runners.

Excellent simulation of the American game.  There are dozens of optional rules and you can add as many as you like.  Each makes the game a little more realistic at the cost of complication.
This game is best in a league where you draft your own team and play several games against each other player.  There are rules for resting players, injuries, and overworking your pitchers that all work well.
You can also play one off games or series (replay the actual playoffs).  It's also an excellent solo game.
A lot of sentimental value here.

2 plays of the basic version, 2 of the advanced-- good, fun game. I see how it earns its reputation. Feels like baseball. I enjoy the decisions, particularly those available to the defense, esp. in the Advanced game. The game works, but also seems to carry some clunkiness along with its age and evolution, and lack of component aesthetics, all within tolerance. I look forward to playing more.

I played APBA for years and it's a great game. It's shortfall IMO is the Basic game is too basic and the Master game to too complex. Constant pitching vs. individual batter lefty/righty calculations and constant base-running vs. fielder throwing calculations. So APBA Master is too much "work" to be fun for me, so APBA has no happy medium.
On the other hand, I've only recently have gotten Strat and it's awesome!  Three levels of play, Basic, Advanced, and Super Advanced.  Basic it too basic for me, but is great for guys who want to crank out games in 20 minutes.  Advanced is definitely that happy medium for its accurate lefty/righty splits, and excellent fielding mechanic. But I quickly stepped up to Super Advanced and don't think I'll ever look back.  It's simply fantastic fun for this solo player. The extra fielding realism, more detailed base stealing mechanics and added realism of individula ballpark effects are just right for me.  Not so much "work" doing math problems.  And the Super Advanced only adds maybe 5 more minutes to each game.   
APBA will always be a favorite, but Strat is definitely my favorite tabletop baseball sim.

RATING: 7
Growing up, my buddy had Strat-o-Matic and I had Statis Pro.  At his house we played Strat-o-Matic and at my house we played Statis Pro.  Both were thrilling, and I would have rated either one of them a 10 at the time.  I liked the extra level of detail that Strat-o-Matic seemed to provide, although I preferred the way that Statis Pro handled the pitchers.

RATING: 9
The absolute best baseball card/dice/simulation game available. If you're looking for a baseball game where player's consistently perform according to ability, managerial decisions abound, and can play in 30-45 minutes, look no further.  Strat-O is the undisputed World Series Champion.

RATING: 10
This is the granddaddy of sims for baseball. I'm not bugged too much by the 50-50 split game engine so many people complain about...for me the only disadvantages are game components, and the lack of rare plays. I learned how to play super-advanced fielding to be able to experience the few rare plays SOM does have. Still, despite those criticisms, SOM is my favorite.  I like the way the game rates fielding, weather, and the pitching fatigue rules. Plus, I can play a hybrid advanced/super-advance game in 40 minutes. Sweet! My favorite baseball game, and I've played a lot of them.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Statistical heaven for baseball geeks, this game is impressively complex and well constructed. I personally find computer simulations to be universally boring because I feel like I'm just watching calculations play out without much input from me. So, from my perspective, this is the choice when I want a baseball simulation fix.

This game is completely hot or cold for me. When it's hot, I'm obsessed for at least an entire weekend, if not for several weeks. When it's not, I have little to no interest in playing. I have never really known anyone willing to play with me, so we're talking 90%+ solo games here. 

I rate this a 9 when it's "hot" and a 5 when it's not, so we'll call it a 7 overall.

Edit - Haven't played this in forever. I seem to have lost my taste for baseball number crunching so I have lowered my rating.

RATING: 8
Baseball is not popular in my family, so I have not played this for 30 years or so.  I collected many teams from the late 60s to the early 70s.  I'm a Cubs fan, so most Cub teams were not that good.  The Pirates were much better and a college friend from Pittsburgh regulary beat my Cubs teams.
Nov 16 update - Go Cubs!  I will be buying some more teams this year and see if my 2016 Cubs can beat those darn 70's Pirates!

RATING: 8.5
A classic simulation that plays fast and fun with the basic rules and it provides two more levels of rules for a deeper experience.  The core design does not account for extreme statistical performances, such as extremely low walk pitchers, or low-powered hitters with no home runs, but this is partially fixed with advanced options.

The Gold Standard in table-top baseball simulations. I have played (and owned) any number of other games (APBA, Longball, Extra Innings, Sherco II, Baseball Strategy, various incarnations of the Sports Illustrated baseball game), but none comes close to the combination of playability, accuracy and fun of Strat-O-Matic. The computer version is fantastic. Saves the trouble of compiling all those stats, which was fun as a kid, but would be tedious now.

RATING: 3
Decent baseball game.  The one negative I have with the game is the pitcher/batter interaction.  Strat is based on a 50% chance of success for the pitcher.  Baseball is a pitchers game.  If you have a great pitcher he is going to shutdown the opposition more times than not.  Not 50% of time.  Strat I feel doesn't simulate this very well.  Statis Pro on the other hand does simulate this interaction very well.  A great pitcher in Strat will only be so-so.  Whereas a great pitcher in Statis Pro will dominate the game.  Hence my low score for Strat.

This was my first non-mainstream game. My grade probably reflects some bias but it was and is a great game. I am a total stats hound and as a teenager I would run 30 game seasons keeping track of stats for every player on every team. That was 25 years ago. I still pull it out from time to time and relive my youth. I have moved on to the PC game as I do not have the time to keep the stats by hand any more. I do not think I will ever let the board game go.

I probably wouldn't choose to play this on my own, but when played with baseball enthusiasts it is quite fun.  I've only played by the basic rules - I'm not sure I'd want to play with the advanced ones because they seemed pretty complicated.  I guess it's all pure dice-rolling, but it's fun to choose players and root for your team.  I would imagine that more skilled players can better assemble teams, but I don't know if I could invest that amount of time into the game.

RATING: 8
Solitaire or 2-player.  

The 2-player game rates an 8.  As a solitaire baseball simulation, I'd only rate it a 7 although the detailed player cards can be a lot of fun to sort through and choose a line-up.  

A frustrating problem with ordering the baseball card sets from Strat-o-matic is that they often don't bother to send the roster/ballpark/weather sheets, and the ones for download at their site are often blurry, incomplete, or otherwise messed up.   :(

I prefer this in a continuous league setting, or for stock past season replays. The advent of the PC game has made the board game all but obsolete for me, as the PC game handles all of the statistical recording. For a head-to-head game, SOM football is more satisfying, with its greater range of strategic and tactical options, bluffing, and playing the opponent rather than the cards.

A tough rating for me, for I've probably played this more than all other games combined (definitely if you count the computer version) but can recognize that it doesn't stand up to something like Puerto Rico or Tigris and Euphrates.

So back in the pre-computer age every baseball fan had their favorite table top baseball game.  This was mine.  Really slick design combined with short time to complete a game and my love of baseball made this close to perfect for me.  Picked up the Hall of Fame version a few years back after not having played in decades.  It was interesting to see how the rules had evolved and nice to see they left the basic version and initial (non-super) advanced version that I grew up on as options.

Been a SOM fan for the better part of 20 years. Only play the boardgame (with the cards) at tournaments - instead usually play the computer version.

Excellent Baseball sim. I've played solo games only.

More complex than MLB showdown. 

The basic rules are very playable. 

I'd like to try the advanced rules and super advanced rules. The split stat cards for the advanced game is intriquing.

Fun to play, but there are two glaring problems with the system.  #1) I am in the camp that hates the 50/50 results of going to the pitcher vs. the batter.  #2) While over the long haul of the season, this is the best statistically accurate baseball game on the market, it doesn't allow a realistic chance for streak (hot/cold) performances within a game, series, week, etc.  But then again, what simulation does?

Baseball sims are unmatched in the gaming world for suspense, and this is the classic (been playing since '76; thanks Uncle Tom and Aunt Fran). Diamond Mind is a more well-developed system for the PC, but there is something very satisfying in holding the cards and rolling the dice that cannot be replaced. I will always have time for a game of Strato.

There's more to it, even... I don't think it would be inaccurate to say that my world view has been influenced by Strat-o-Matic. Seeing a player have an apparent "hot streak" or "cold streak" [i]for no reason whatsoever[/i] (because after all, he's a piece of cardstock) has given me a strong sense of  the variability in human existence, that frees me from looking for explanations that don't exist. To a certain extent, it even frees me from listening to people looking for explanations that don't exist. But in the long run (Law of Large Numbers) the good players will perform well, while the scrubs are scrubs for a reason. It's not the little things that count; it's the big things. All of which adds up to a weird version of faith.  I'll mention the importance of the folks at Baseball Prospectus in reinforcing this perspective, even though they came around after the bulk of my Strato playing experience. This is not a good explanation, I'll have to edit this.

Computer version: it's lots of fun--decent graphics, but since it's a simulated boardgame and not an action PC game, that's not a big deal. Instead of replaying the 2008 season, I've created a brand new league for the 2010 season. The PC version feels like a different animal from the physical versions of Replay Baseball and APBA Baseball. One gets a sense of being simply the manager/coaches in the PC version, while the boardgames seem to have a sense of being more immersed in the play. I'm not rating this game, since I've not played the physical version.

Played solo umpteen games, also played in a FTF league for a short while.  I get lost in this game and all the possibilities it puts into my imagination.  Hal's use of abstraction in this game (boiling down the pitcher-batter confrontation to a single roll) allows me to play a full baseball game in 20-30 minutes without feeling like I missed anything.  It's brilliant, and he came up with it when he was 11!  I would always take this out and play it.  This is my "10" benchmark.

This was the first game I was ever addicted to, and I must have played thousands of indivdual games, both solo and with my friends.

Owned two different times but didn't get far with it, although my actual plays are probably around 50.  No question it's a very good game though, probably because I didn't allow myself sufficient plays to appreciate the system, so I'm convinced I'm underrating it. It just didn't give me the feel for baseball like APBA or Replay Baseball do. But that's really nothing against S-O-M.

Primary developer of the 50/50 system (between hitter and pitcher results) of generating baseball results, so it that sense a seminal game, and continues to sell and be played today by its adherents.

The number crunchers dream, and the original fantasy baseball. The game is flexible to allow for as much complexity as you want. Want to chuck the dice and move the players? Great! Want to have access to almost every type of decision a manager would need to make real time? Go for it! Want to see if the Yankees of the 1920s could compete with your favorite team's current lineup? You can even do that! This was the first of its kind and is the best, which is why the company still produces cards yearly.

A sports simulation has wandered into a database of games. Compared to other baseball simulations, this has all the usually SOM drawbacks: rating scale can't accommodate extreme performances, player abilities are hard to read (being crammed into a matrix of 3d6 results), and it's boring. Put the batter card next to the pitcher card and roll 3d6. Half the time the batter is ignored and half the time the pitcher is ignored. Sometimes the result requires an additional roll of a d20, with perhaps 17 chances for a line out to shortstop and 3 chances for a double to center. Great bat control? Perfect defensive positioning? No, the designers weren't satisfied with the granularity of 3d6. And the game doesn't actually come with a d20, just 20 perforated cards in 20 different sizes with numbers 1 to 20 printed on them. Boring. Statistically, it pretty much works out. 
A valiant effort, and no doubt popular for a reason, just not my cup of Ballantine.

Thank you for saving my sanity on rainy days when I was a kid!

I saw an advertisement for the game in a 1964 magazine and decided to check it out.  I filled out the card and mailed it with a dime.  The brochure that came back intrigued me.  Up to this point my friends and I had been playing with games using spinners.  Of course this caused arguments over "was it on the line or not."  When the game arrived with a couple of teams, I immediately fell in love with the mechanics.

I showed it to my best friend growing up.  His dad bought the entire game complete with all the teams.  Now every game was an all-star game.  Later, when the football game came out we got into that as well.  Imagine our luck when another kid moved into the neighborhood and he played as well.

Our first choice was to be outside playing the real thing, but when it rained or was dark, Strat-o-Matic was our best friend for hours.

Strat-O-Matic's main strengths are: i. that it comes with Basic, Advanced, and Super Advanced versions, making the advanced versions easier to learn; ii. the large number of people playing this game make it easy, or at least possible, to find a FtF partner.

There are other baseball games available that are as good as or better than Strat-O-Matic Super Advanced, but Strat is a solid game.  

Some of the competitors have greater accuracy (they have fixed the '50-50 problem') and detail (especially in terms of tactical options) and better season selections.

I deducted points for shipping and customer service problems that others and I have had (in 2011, in my case).  Things seem to be deteriorating in those areas. 

Fortunately, there are excellent alternative games, including far more detailed games that have been developed more recently.

Certainly not a game for everyone, especially those not into baseball. I find it most fun with the Advanced and Super Advanced rules since that's when more strategy is added and less is left up to the dice and statistical averages. Baseball lovers will love the depth of possibilities! My opinion is that this game is not nearly as simple as many reviewers make it out to be. The core moves are pretty simple, but all the cards, charts, dice combinations, infield possibilities, error ratings, outfielder arm strength, pitcher fatigue, injury possibilities, base running possibilities, and even weather and stadium condition make this game both very realistic as well as complex. A great game for a parent with a child!

The CD version is great because you can replay a season quickly.  I actually no longer even have the boardgame because of the CD version.

Baseball is my favorite sport but possibly least favorite to game.  Baseball plays much better as a computer game because any one game can go either way and play scripted.

I find Strat baseball cumbersome to play
in the solitaire setting.  It's aggre-
vating having to roll a 20-sided die
with runners on base to chack for WP/PB.
In general, play is quite slow.  I also
noticed that utiity players are always
given the worst range ratings, at least
in the seasons I have.  This is probably
a better game if played with an opponent.

My favorite non-computer baseball game. I probably spent a couple of man-years playing every game of a full 24 team x 162 game season. The teams were a melding of 1972-1975 rosters by the time I finally finished: Orioles over the Mets in the WS. Played many more single team seasons, once I taught my venerable C64 to play against me, and play off the other games for the rest of the league.

My rating is from when I was about 11 years old. I think I played at least one game per day after school for at least a year or more. I would imagine I've logged more hours playing this (solo play) than any other game, but haven't played in, oh, about 25 years. EDIT: I decided to give the game a true rating based on my feelings today. I looked it over the other day, and the truth is, I'm just not that much of a baseball fan anymore.

Game is medium weight if you add on the advanced-super advanced rules. Light for the basic. Love the fast game play and very realistic results.
Game gets less than a 10 from me because: graphics desperately need a facelift; components are run-of-the-mill quality for looks and sturdiness; and S-O-M's prices are starting to get high for their card sets -- ordering the 2008 MLB teams without the extra players costs $40 with shipping.

But the gameplay is great and perfect for stat trackers. Being able to play teams such as the 1909 Detroit Tigers is a fan's dream come true.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
If only the player cards and components had more personality (and more player aids were included for advanced players)...it's definitely a must for the sports sim gamer, no doubt about it. Three different levels of play should satisfy everyone from the casual dice-roller to the hardcore managerial mind. The Achilles heel for this one is the same as it is for almost every baseball game I've played: a pitcher fatigue system woefully out of touch with how relievers are actually used these days.

A very good baseball game, a bit more statistically accurate than APBA but plays a lot slower. The cards are not as fun either, except for the full color hall of fame cards, which look beautiful.

This is my desert island/save from fire game.  I&#039;ve played literally thousands of games.  When I was a kid SOM put me in an alternate universe, one where Pete Rose won the seventh and final game of the &#039;75 series with a walk-off homerun!  Game five, by the way, was my longest ever, a twenty-one inning thriller!!!  I think that&#039;s a great thing about Strat - it encourages narratives like this.  My wife likes baseball but hates this game.  She says its like doing taxes - look up this, look up that.

Like the game of baseball itself, this game can provide games that are gems of tension and drama or games that are dull, dreary duds. However, the more familiar you become with the rules and the card charts, the more you can lose yourself in the illusion that you are a big league manager spitting sunflower seed shells onto the dugout steps, plotting the one move that will steal your team the game.

I have probably played over 100 games of this, just before I started logging. It's OK out of the box as is and can be pretty fun to use to learn about baseball strategy, but the game REALLY shines when played in a head-to-head league with drafting "all-star" teams. It's like fantasy baseball before fantasty baseball was everywhere, but it's in a face-to-face league where YOU roll the dice, determine the outcomes, and play the games. In that environment, this game is a strong perfect 10 rating.

My favorite table-top baseball game.  After a flirtation with Dynasty League (Pursue the Pennant), which is a slightly deeper system, we have returned to the SOM and never looked back.  The big strength is the ability to play an entire series in less than an hour and an entire season in the course of a month.  Resulting stats seem scarily accurate and the way the card hit streaks and slumps is simply spooky.

I've got a single strat-o-matic buddy (also my email chess buddy!), but he lives across the country, so I only get to play it with him about once a year.  I think that's about perfect.

RATING: 6
A good game for it's time, which has seen some transformation over the years.  The strengths of the game are it's simplicity (basic game), and ease of play, as most of the results are found printed on the players cards themselves.  
The weak points here come in line with the advanced game, which bogs down play with so many symbols and distractions on the cards, as well as the 50/50 game engine, which truly seems to fall more towards the generic side of gaming than statistical accuracy.  Nonetheless, it's a good game to add to one's collection.

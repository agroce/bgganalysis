This was a fun party game that reminded me of pit. 11 people can play so it's good for big groups. half sell and the other half buy. there are two winners, one buyer and one seller. the goal it to negotiate and sell/buy the best. 

I thought that my family would get a kick out of this one. This is my kind of party game.

WAY too chaotic for me.  Yelling across the table, making investments that are almost completely at the mercy of die rolls, just not my cup of tea at all.  Was unable to make myself finish the game, which is less than 90 minutes long.

One of the most fun "party" games ever. This is one of the few games where the more players the better.

Edit: The investment boards will start to wear out. I think rubbing the board with your thumb causes it to happen. Mayday sells card sleeves (dixit sleeves) that perfectly cover the boards, and should extend the game life greatly. The sleeves are a very snug fit, but if you work them gently they will fit.

Masters of Commerce is an auction game that adds a twist by dividing its players between landlords and traders, each group earning money in a different way and competing among themselves.  

For the landlords, the game is OK, if rather straightforward.  You're playing auctioneer, renting offices to the traders.  Then you're competing in auctions with other landlords for more offices.  Offices are colour coded to match commodities and the rent you're likely to get this turn is a bit less than the commodity's current price.  No offices go un-rented since each represents a share in a commodity and the chance to earn money.

For the traders, I think this game has an uncomfortably large luck element.  The prices of some commodities will change little and slowly, whereas others are subject to greater swings.  Hence, for the traders the game boils down to how much they are prepared to gamble and whether that pays off. 

Production quality is pretty good.  The artwork is functional.

RATING: 6
This is certainly a frothy party game with potentially lots of excitement and shouting, kind of like the stereotypical scenes of the floor of wall street.  If that sounds like fun, and I think many people do find this fun, then this game will be fun for you.  For me, it is not quite fun to do that, and so I can't say I want to play this game again.  Nevertheless, I do respect the design and components and do believe some people will really like this "panic" and "pandemonium" game.

It's a party game, nothing heavy, but a very good one with the right crowd. Would not recommend with less than 5. It has the frenzy of pit, with the unknown factor of the die roll.

2 minutes of yelling at a bunch of different people has never been so fun. There's some tedious bookkeeping at the end of each round, but the game is over quickly enough that it doesn't matter. Great game with 3 all the way up to 11.

RATING: 7
Most chaotic game I have played, and yet, the results are too consistent to be random. If you look behind the yelling and screaming, there's a strategy behind it- just like in real life.

Had the investors call an impromptu meeting in the kitchen during the last play, and come out unionized refusing to pay a cent over 25k for any property. It was magnificent.

A surprisingly fun, negotiation game with two different teams interacting creating a very interesting synergy and sense of community among players despite being a highly competitive game.

A rather bare bones negotiation and auction game. Some fun with the right crowd but overall the game seems to lack something and is quite chaotic particularly for the merchants.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I'll be darned! This might be one of the best light negotiation games I've played. I love the idea of a good negotiation game, but often the actual gameplay produces something that falls a bit flat. My favorite is still Chinatown, but this is easier, more approachable and can handle a larger group. It is kinda like "gamer Pit."

Some random thoughts... one thing that wasn't really apparent until I played the game was the injection of new properties each round. In round 1, a landlord is simply haggling over three properties. But that easily epxands to 8-10 properties by the end of the game, turning a round into fast order taking. The auction round for landlords takes a bit of time, but I'm not sure a better way to execute it other than trying a once-around bid, which might add some nice tension.

Solid game that my lunch crew was excited to try again.

Update: one play in 3+ years... that's not a condemnation of the game, more likely a reflection on the groups I game with. I don't find myself in larger light gaming groups, so off to the trade list this went.

RATING: 5
Considerably more fun than it should be. But, ultimately not a very interesting game. Choose your risk profile (which, for everyone should be pretty damned high), do the math, buy/sell your stuff, do it fast. I imagine that without the clock, the choices become deathly boring.

When you play 7+ players (you need to at least play once with the full compliment of 11) this game is pure loud and chaotic fun. You can make an alliance with an investor when you are a manager and vice versa since you are not competing with each other and everything comes up to that two minutes of negotiation. Amazing party game.

Flat out ... not my cup of tea.  Many other games that play fast and are easy on the rules are out there.  No historical flavor what-so-ever in this game.  Just players that haggle over rent price.  I don't see much room for variation.

I played this game as a team building activity with my group at wok, and it was great in that context.  The game revealed a number of realistic market dynamics and participant tendencies.  However, I feel the game is a bit dry for a party game, and the action is unfortunately punctuated by long periods of payouts and an auction that only engages half the players. The large player count that can be smoothly accommodated is a great asset though, and the production on the Panic on Wall Street edition is very good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A Pit-style free-for-all.   Where you are sitting at the table can be a factor, as you are less likely to interact with people who are miles away.   Probably should be considered when you play, but bigger groups are certainly better for this type of game.   I think the game stalls at the intermediate auctions, and there are a LOT of those, but it really captures the buy/sell chaos very well.   Perhaps the best paper money I've ever seen in game.  A fun "experience" type of game.

I own the Masters of Commerce edition; [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/1470122/panic-on-wall-street]components[/url] of the Panic on Wall Street edition are much nicer.

Like [gameid=140] on steroids, in terms of the frantic negotiation/trading element.  But it's not as light, because it features an economic system where players are working under a 2 minute time limit to make deals to rent properties from other players, and successful rentals will then earn them income in a volatile market.  I especially liked how half the players are landlords while the other half are merchants, so it has two winners.  

It's like being on Wall Street really, and if you enjoy games of this sort it's well worth keeping an eye on.  Works well with non-gamers too.

Nos tendremos que dividir en dos grupos, cada grupo juega de una forma totalmente distinta, Un ser√°n los empresarios que compraran empresas en una subasta y vender√°n acciones de esas empresas, el otro grupo son los inversores que tiene que comprar acciones de empresas.
Hay tres tipos de empresas con mayor o menor riesgo para los inversores pero claro pueden hacerte ganar mucho dinero o perder mucho cuanto mayor sea el riesgo.
Es un juego para grandes grupos, donde el caos, la risas, el azar est√°n muy presentes.
es importante el grupo de juego, aunque en el momento de compra de acciones todo el mundo participa, si alguien en el grupo es m√°s t√≠mido saldr√° perdiendo y perdera chicha el juego.

The hit game from Essen 2011 in my book and many others'. Just amazing, noisy, fast, dirty, raw, very fun, sharp negotiation game. Maybe I will tire of it after a while, but at the moment I see it running and running. A more stripped down, bare knuckle, brutally honest free market trading game I have never seen. MoC just throws you around like a rag doll and it's hilarious. The most fun I've had for years and the SHOUTING!

This game amounts to a few simple rules and a framework for real-time negotiation that provides an experience not unlike Pit.  It's unique in that it allows for up to 10 players who are split into two groups for the entire game (companies and investors) and in that there will be two winners - the most successful players from each group!  It's a wheelin' and dealin' party game with nice components that takes about 30-45 minutes to play.  I enjoy most negotation games, and this one fills a great niche in my collection.

Mayhem!! Likely to cause one player to pop a forehead vein during gameplay, but nobody will notice due to the frantic goings-on!

One of the most enjoyable, loud, & hilarious party games out there. You really do feel like a stockbroker haggling over stock prices. The managers have to work hard on their end to make the most of their profits also (though the Investors have a bit more fun at it). All in all, a game that will always have a place on the shelf.

Very different game of pure negotiation and adjusting to the market. The idea of having two separate groups of players, each with its own winner, works out well. This means that the actual price you negotiate is not as important as the relative prices to other players. Luck of the dice plays a smaller part than you think at first, also because you are only competing against the others in your group. 

It's not something you could play a lot of, but it's reasonably quick and very fast-paced but not entirely based on speed. Also, it's stripped down to the bare essentials, which is vital for a game like this.

Different in that it's actually better with more players (up to a point, I would imagine), since everyone is negotiating at once. Six was a good number, four would be too few, more would be fine.

RATING: 8
A fast-paced economic party game, based on probability and psychology. Might get repetitive after a few games. The ability to calculate the expected values of dice rolls gives you an edge over your opponents. Still, you play just 5 rounds, so the distribution of results might be different than expected, and thus luck plays a big role in this game. Other important factors are: the ability to make quick decisions and evaluating your chances. Quite fun, I will definitely play it more.

Risk management is very important in this game. It's a bit similar to poker: You can either raise (the rent) or fold (and give up the property to another player), when you think the deal is to risky.

Depending on the situation during the game, the game may feature more or less negotiation between merchants and landlords.

I just got this game, and played it with 5 people, which I was very skeptical of, as it seemed to really lend itself to a larger group.

I think it will be better with a large group, but 5 was a very fun game, and everyone wanted more when we were done.

The components are awesome, and it's one of a few games that I opened up, and all the pieces were in a nice spot and I didn't need to start planning on how I was going to store the game.  No plano boxes, no baggies, everything makes sense. 

One minor quibble - I think they should have made several different "companies" for the companies that they are being sold in each color.  Instead of 5 or 6 "Hamster radios", I would have liked to see a few more blue companies.  Most people chuckle when they see them, and it would just add to the feel of actually investing in a company.  Again, it's a minor thing.

I got this on a deal of the day, and at 15 dollars, I expect it to be one of my best values in my collection.  I can see this hitting the table a lot.

Update:  Played this a couple other times with larger groups (8-10), and it is MUCH better with a large group.  Very fun, and the sort of game that people who "don't like board games" can definitely enjoy.  It takes over the room, as the talking/shouting gets loud and it'd be hard to play anything else during it.  Excellent, unique game though, but I don't think it's something you can play every night.

Too much chaos. Not really a game based on logical play. I took third (or maybe 2nd) among the buyers by making so that I was net 0 and if people bid over me they would take a loss on ‚Äòpredictable‚Äô shops. The ‚Äòmore‚Äô volatile markets were so much speculation that it felt like a lot of ‚Äòwork‚Äô just for a few die roles. I think I might have enjoyed it more as a shop keeper, where the bidding for the shops seemed to be the only thing interesting and fun going on.

Excellent fun. There is almost no chance of making good decisions in the two minute decision period, which is part of the joy. There is a genuine desperation in trying to sell all your junk stock, and nothing makes you feel like a capitalist like waving a fistful of cash at people. The paper money in this is excellent too, thick enough to handle, long enough to waft a fistful of dollars in people's faces.

What I mean is that it is not all about rolling dice and see the outcome, it is also about negotiating according to the market status.

This game is a real fun! Not a typical boardgame with all that shouting. Very good for occasional meetings - can catch non-gamers well and hosts up to 11 players. I do not expect very good replayability. And I do not mind the randomness of dice rolls - its just a fun!
Best with 7+ players.

This game make you feel like you are really standing on the center of stock trading center in Wall Street. One part of players take the role as investors, the other part of players are on the side as fund dealers. As soon as the game begin, the game space is changed to loud and noisy place. The game is quite ok as a party game. Because of the noisy situation and pressing time limit, the gmae is sometimes not working smoothly. In my opinion, the game needs more final touches on game mechanics.

RATING: 7
Fun, loud game for a large group that doesn't overstay its welcome.  The fact that there are two winners and any one person is only competing with half the table is a great mechanic for keeping everyone in a large game engaged.

I want to get this to the table more to see how the metagame evolves.

I do wish the tiles with the company names had more variation, though - clearly there was a manufacturing error which they hung a lampshade on in the rulebook.

Edit: After trying Chinatown, I knocked off a point.  Still, this is a large group negotiation game, which is pretty unique.

I knew this wasn't my type of game, but my choices were to play this or do nothing.  I chose to play.  I don't regret it, but I don't think I'll be seeking this out any time soon.  It's a negotiation game, and I've never been much of a fan of those.  There is a bit of an economic engine, so maybe that helped.  There are two different roles in the game: merchants and landlords.  I think being a landlord helped, because the merchants seem to drive the negotiations more than the landlords.

I was expecting a better game. Still, Panic on Wall Street! is a good party game. It has lots of luck but I don‚Äôt mind much in this kind of game. 

On the good side we have: 
-	The rules are very simple to explain.
-	The game components are very good.
-	It plays up to 11 players with no fuzz.
-	It is fun and loud.

On the bad side:
-	Buyers have to deal with a lot more of (mostly) uncontrollable luck than sellers. Luck also affect sellers but it has less impact.
-	Artwork is ok, but not very good.
-	Not sure the game has a large replayability factor, I would think all the games are very similar. Will have to play more to see if this is correct.
-	It has very limited negotiation.

Bottom line, an ok game I would like to own, still I prefer Pit, it accomplishes the same with less rules. Perhaps I¬¥ll change my mind with more plays of Panic on Wall Street!

I finally played the game again and I didn‚Äôt enjoy it much. It can be fun with the right crowd, but I prefer other party games over this one.

In my last game there was a huge kingmaker play (when a player owes money to two other players, he can chose who to pay, so in truth, he can choose who wins among these two players), and I realize that this can happen rather often. Due to this I‚Äôm downgrading its rating. I won‚Äôt ever buy it.

One play only

The first auction game I've played in a long time that has felt fresh.

The nearest point of comparison is probably Modern Art in that the value of the auctioned items is purely based on the players' interpretation of how the value of the goods being auctioned will develop, albeit the market here is influenced by dice rolls as much as player action.

The really neat twist is how the players are divided into two sets (merchants and landlords IIRC); there will actually be two winners, one from each set.

The sets are asymmetric, with landlords bidding for 'apartments' of 5 different colours that they then rent to the merchants at freely negotiated prices, while the merchants have to predict how much money they will recoup from the market for each room they rent. You have to beat the others in your set by better interpreting what the players in the other set are likely to want and/or be willing to pay as well in relation to how the market values of each type of apartment will develop. The fun side of capitalism (at least the money's not for real!) - good stuff.

Played the original Masters of Commerce version. The game splits the players into landlords and merchants. Each turn, merchants rent storefronts from landlords in a raucous 2 minute negotiation period. The rest of the turn is dealing with the results of those negotiations. You roll dice to determine how much the merchants make and then the merchants pay the landlords and the landlords pay taxes and buy more properties. Repeat 5 times. The merchant and landlord with the most money both win.

The game reminded me of a number of other titles, like Modern Art, Pit, Container, I'm the Boss. However, this game has a feature the others don't share which is the VERY swingy dice rolls that determine the merchant payouts. You can make some decisions to mitigate the risks, but those who are lucky on the rolls will do much better. The short 5 turn game isn't long enough to mitigate the drastic value changes. And ultimately, the low risk colors pay out too much compared the high risk colors and the risk/reward ratio feels off. Maybe my opinion is colored by a first game where all of the merchants constantly battled bankruptcy and required debt forgiveness from the landlords to stay in the game. While I can see that different rolls and holding ground for lower rents could make for a better game, I think I'd rather play all of the other games I listed as similar over this. The player's opinions were mixed, but this was too swingy for me.

More interesting than it seems like it would be by reading the rules. The negotiation phase is very chaotic, loud and a lot of fun.

The resolution of the market is quite random, but not overly so. I also like the risks involved, especially the "hail mary" red stock.

That said, at 5 rounds, it is a hair too long for my tastes, and each round feels pretty much the same.

This is a great auction game. It is quick, flexible with player counts, and involves a lot of social interaction as well as some skill.

The fact that there are essentially two games being played at the same time in the two groups, with two winners, is an interesting twist, and one that gives the game it's standout play experience.

Players have to negotiate a position relative to their peers as well as their clients, and this mixture of goals and incentives creates a novel dynamic that yields some interesting results when pushed by the pressure of time.

It is a bit mathy, though, so it might not fit with in some situations where other social games might.

The game is interesting in that it divides into two groups with two winners.  Managers acquire companies and sell shares to investors.  Investors are betting that some companies will pay out more than others.

The components are fine. If the pictures of different company are different, it will be great.
The bidding of company among managers needs improvement. The open bidding is not so fair. 
The sitting position is also important for this game, which needs enough room for transaction and offering prices.
The rolling of dice about the stock market has no trend, just a gambling game.

It certainly is fun, tense, and loud.  However, there is too much randomness involved with the stock values.

We were looking for an eight player game with a bit of depth to it and Masters of Commerce (listed here as Panic on Wall Street!) fits the bill nicely. The players are either landlords or investors and compete against only other players of their type. However, to win they need to strike the best bargains with their opposite numbers and manage their risk by either investing in non-volatile properties of trying their luck at the high risk high return ones and hope that the market is kind to them. 

This is a fun game for a large group who enjoy negotiation-type games and don‚Äôt mind a bit of luck. One to consider if you have a large amount of players to accommodate.

Summary: My favorite party game. Simple, fast, and loud, this game shines with between 5-11 people that love competition. 

Key Highlights:

* Fast: a game can be over in as little as 25 minutes.
* Great for large groups: works from 5-11 players, best with 7-11
* Cut throat: the negotiations are intense, yet always remain fun.

Conclusion: This game is the second most requested game in my group. Every single person that's played a game of this with us has enjoyed it, and most request a second round.

Games with a strict time limit are humorous but also intensely stressful. One moment the player is pumping his fist in joy, the other moment sinking into depression. It's more of an experience than a game... The main problem is that the die rolls decide too much, and the player choices decide too little in comparison. Risk assessment is fine, but in this case bad luck can completely override good play.

It's a workable concept, having two groups - investment managers and investors - who are playing for the win within their group only, not caring who wins in the other group. You'll be attracted to the investor side if you like the wildness of Pit, because the crux of your game is the wild open bidding period where you're hoping to win the bid on shares that you then hope will go up in price. You'll be attracted to the manager side if you like normal auctions, because at the end of each round you'll be bidding against the other managers for companies that the investors will pay most for (they pay you for the right to earn its dividend). Either way, you determine the odds of the price increasing or decreasing, and then end up paying as close to that as the other investors bid you up. In effect, it's a gambling game, not my favourite genre. Eventually the game for the investors is going to come down to who bet big on red (the most volatile) and whether they got lucky or unlucky with its roll. Everything else stays pretty stable which ain't that exciting. The combination of which doesn't drive a lot of need for replay.

Just bought it and will try it with families on Dec.

2013-12-27 --- Played my first game. It was a 7P game. All players were exciting, giving out noise even it was 2:00 am, haha.
It is our first time to play this. People learnt how to set the stock price after 3 or 4 rounds finally. You need to big table since those managers will keep to buy companies which need space to put. 
I think it is my 2nd party game recently while Avalon is my 1st. As played too many times on Avalon, most likely this crazy stock bidding game will move to my 1st soon, haha. It is a must-buy and must-keep forever as it is easy to explain to any new players and you can play as a manager in this game , then play as an investor in next game.

A sharp negotiation game, a brilliant idea to split the players into to teams. 
The owners need to get bids (higher the better) as open space represents a dead loss. 
The investors need low bids to maximize return and minimize risk. 
The tension between the 2 groups and among the group is palatable. Add a time element and it is a good bidding game.

Really fun party negotiation game.  It was really noisy in the Treefrog hotel at Essen this year after one of the Frogs purchased a copy.  The rest of us bought our copies the next day.  Fast and frenetic negotiation in the style of Pit is the order of the day here.

Noise.  Pandemonium.  Haggling.  
This beautiful game mimics the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, and does so with style.

It can be a little random for the investors, but risk management and speculation is the entire basis for their side of the game, and players who show wit are rewarded for it.

Quite a surprise. Plays fast and supports a lot of players well. A loud game of furious negotiation. Each team has their own special objective, but it seems like it's pretty balanced no matter which team you choose. Always fun to see someone take a chance and win big.

1.12.14 Two games. First was with six player and was fun. 2nd game was with 9 players. While a little chaotic with big numbers, it's loud, fun, and very enjoyable. It's great that both sides are playing against each other, so there are two winners. ON the managers side, it's tough to keep track of who is winning, but I enjoy the bidding for new business to sell. On the buyers part, there is the thrill of investing and the payoff or losing money. Lot's of meta gaming for both sides. Won't play this all the time, but I do like the game, thus my rating of 8.

At the risk of damning with faint praise this is quite good. A little too random for my taste - it would be good (and thematic) if the managers could attempt to influence their share price somewhat, but that said you wouldn't want to over-complicate this. Not a game I would want to buy but would be content to try again if the opportunity arises.

Kind of Pit meets Speculation, I guess. It almost seems too simple in that as a manager, you've got to go with the market price among the investors and as an investor, you just play the managers against each other. However, there's two nice twists that really add significantly and make for entertaining game play: 1. Since the price of stocks are volatile (and of different volatility), you can entice your fellow players to gamble (or not) on which kinds of stocks. 2. You're able to arrange deals where you lock the stocks. It can be interesting as to whether or not you take an early offer to lock something in or decline it and hope you can make more money from another investor. There's not too much downtime, as the new stocks available are auctioned off quickly to the managers so the investors don't wait too long.

Economic party (?) game where players are split into two groups. The original game was themed after business owners negotiating with landlords to rent space; the retheme is much more tenuously about investors negotiating for control of managers' companies. Each group plays quite a different game and, as such, there will be one winner from each.

Landlords pay $10 per turn for each space they own and must negotiate with businesses to rent it out for the highest price. They earn whatever they can negotiate and have to balance that income against each turn's auction of new property.

Business owners, on the other hand, earn a certain amount depending on which of the four types of property they occupy. The trick is that the prices fluctuate randomly -- they range from high risk and high reward (potential wild swings from losing $20 one turn to gaining $70 the next) to very low risk (never lower than $20 and never moving up or down more than $10).

The difficulty for me is that managers/landlords play a clever, largely luck-free negotiation game, but the investors/businesspeople are more like game components than players: they are there to simulate market forces. It is essentially trivial to work out the actual expected value for any given property, so insofar as there is any differentiation between investors it results from a) getting in first, b) charging the lowest risk premium, and c), most strongly, rolling the dice.

It's fun enough and a decent simulation, but only half of it is worth playing.

A bitter-sweet pleasure. I'd love to have a copy, but I've no idea when I might manage to play it. First game had 11 players. A curious game in that there are two different roles (Landlords & Traders), but its not a team game: there are two independent winners. I was a Landlord mainly because it entitled me to a chair (it had been a long day). Traders hire Landlord's property with a view to earning cash from volatile semi-predictable income, after paying the Landlord the fixed sum agreed. Landlords also have to acquire property through auctions, and pay a little tax each turn. I won - mainly through cutting back property acquisition as the market became flooded, and being fortunate enough to have no exposure to the Traders who went bust and couldn't pay their Landlords. Man, those wacky Traders made some non-sensical unprofitable deals!

Yes! Greed is good! Lunch is for wimps! Real time deal making on the chaotic trading floor of the 1930s New York Stock Exchange where fortunes can be won and lost. You really need at least 5 players minimum to enjoy this game as intended. I have played with 6 and it was a blast. Would love to play with the max player count.

This is a provisional rating, based on one play with only four players. That meant that everyone was an investor and a business owner. With eight, the negotiations then take on a different emphasis and I'm keen to see how that impacts gameplay...

Loud. Really loud.

Can teach the rules in just a couple minutes and it's a lot of fun to try and screw your friends out of good deals.

Plays best at the upper player counts which makes this one tricky to get to the table. But it's something special if you get a bunch of excited people in a room, just make sure no kids are trying to nap.

Nach den ersten beiden Spielen: Wirklich ein "Twilight Struggle" light! Das "Tauziehen" um die Länder verschärft sich immer mehr, bis es schliesslich um die letzten beiden Länder geht. Die Entscheidung, ob man eine Karte für den Effekt einsetzt, oder lieber Einflusspunkte sichert, ist oft schwer.
Sehr gut: Um zu Blockieren muss man den Einflusswert erreichen oder überbieten, den der andere Spieler auslegt. Damit gibt es kein "Schwächen", indem man nur ein wenig gegensteuert. Ganz oder gar Nicht! Das belohnt "große" Manipulationen im Bereich von 7 bis 11 Punkten...

Interesting tug of war style 2 player game. I liked this one OK. Rules for when you can add +1 or have to subtract -1 on Influence and Blocking actions are rather confusing for such a simple game. I think players would need 2-3 games just to get that. Print out a summary sheet as the mini card size one included in the box is junk. I will hold onto this for a while as I think Flo might like it.

Could be associated to a light version of "Twilight Struggle", but I rather prefer the latter one.  "1955" is supposed to be a short game, but it can last quite a while if you and your opponent can anticipate and block each other:  we've declared the game "even" after about 3 hours, and it got rather less interesting after the first hour, whereas I can play "Twilight Struggle" for hours...  
I'll have to give it a try with an other opponent.

This game obviously shares elements with tug of war but I came away thinking that Judo is a better real world match. You can end up sparing for a while but once the opponent has started their move even if you see it coming it can all ends so quickly.

This is mechanically somewhat like Twilight Struggle its speed and high luck content make it a game appart.  We were not using many of the events in our first play through and the game clearly has more depth to explore.  I hope to return to this game soon.

Sustained equilibrium does not seem to be an likely outcome. Like Lost Cities I think a series of three games in a row might feel a little less random.

Hooboy. Now I know why they keep giving this game a way. An overly fiddly tug-of-war with tacked on "special ability" cards. The appealing aesthetic of the game wears off as soon as you learn any details of the gameplay. I wanted this to be a hidden gem, but I'm wishing I'd kept it hidden.

678-It's the mid-fifties and the Cold War is just starting to heat up! This game w/ the slightly abstract board, and w/ a widely diverse and very clever card deck will let 2 people have a 30 minute mental tug of war. Since the luck of the draw will not always be fair, winning will frequently be determined by the spy who makes the best strategic combinations of his hand. Your first game will likely be your worst. Persist! Whoever told you espionage would be easy?   (41)

Oh my, I really hated this game. I can handle the fact that a completely dry abstract (I am almost surprised there was no dust in the box when I opened it) has a pasted-on theme; other games have done that successfully. I can even handle that the artwork completely fails to convey the desired atmosphere for the game. But I really had the impression that the author had started with the (potentially interesting) [i]theme[/i] and then added mechanisms and nothing better than this came out of it. 
Gameplay is utterly fiddly, play a card, add a bonus or a card or substract a number, be blocked by the opponent unless his/her cards have the wrong color or the numbers don't add up because s/he has to substract a penalty for being in the wrong spot at the wrong time, then move a cube 5.3 squares to the left or right or wherever. Rinse and repeat. I wish the Cold War had been so boring. 
The rule book is, while extensively giving examples (which is a good thing), also not very straightforward. I read through it twice, and while I think we got everything right when we played, the rulebook didn't give me a feeling for the game at all. Or made me want to play it. Ah well, another game for my trade pile.

Initial Rating: 5.5 (July 2012)

I played this after playing Twilight Struggle. The theme of the games is similar, but 1955 is a very simple game. I feel there are not enough interesting decisions to make me play again, often there was one obvious path to take and our game was decided by luck. It is a tug o' war game but it has A LOT of luck in it, which I dislike, perhaps with more plays I can see the finer strategy but I´m not willing to play it often. 

The art is decent but I really don’t like the theme of the game.

I believe I could be convinced to play again but this is not a game I will request EVER.

Not a bad way to kill 30 minutes. Nice tug of war battle that reminds me of Twilight Struggle. Came down to a final hand where Rob made a move to line up a win on his next turn then I laid my hand down for the win. Wish the rules were written just a little bit clearer.  We spent much of time going back to the reference card trying to make sure we were making the right move.

Rules are a bit confusing. A tug of war kind of game, which would be fine if it didn't last so long. Times Square has a similar feel but plays in a third of the time, plus comes with nifty wooden shapes to play with. Maybe it's the cold war theme that bogs this one down? Maybe it's the cards that have multiple functions and you're supposed to keep track of all of those. This game just wasn't for us.

Played once.  When the game ended, I asked "what did I just play?"  I mean, it is not at all a bad game, but I was expecting something quicker.  This can be a long game, and is not at all a filler, which is what I was expecting.  It's not nearly as long as your average game of Twilight Struggle, but longer than CIA vs KGB.  I have no burning desire to play again, but there is really nothing wrong with this game.

Twilight Struggle in its primitive form?  The swing of tug of war between US and USSR in a Cold War atmosphere has always been captivating to me.  The card art seems to be nice.  Maybe a nice filler game in an hour between 2 players.

RATING: 7
I got this based on reviews I read which made it sound like a light, quick version of Twilight Struggle. I can sort of see the comparison there (apart from the obvious theme similarity) but it's a little bit of a stretch. Still, it's a tense, strategic tug-of-war game with a lot of possibilities. Nice look to it as well.

This is a two-player tug-of-war-style game with dual use cards like many card-driven wargames.  There are a number of nation tracks on the board, you're trying to move a marker all the way to your side of the board to "lock" it.  The cards can be used for either their numerical value, advancing markers to your side or blocking an opponent's advance, or for their special text.  Some of the more important cards stayed out to give you a permanent benefit (until your opponent gets rid of it, at least).  Like many card games, this one is pretty random, and all about which cards you draw.  The game is pretty tactical, but since you're not building up much, it's not very strategic.

RATING: 7
Six simultaneous tug-of-war tracks controlled card driven game style where you can use face-value action points or enact a special event. 

The Cold War theme is very well done, though pasted on what is essentially an abstract. The card art is excellent.

Plays similar to Knizia's Times Square with a more fun theme and juggling multiple outcomes.

I tend to play Times Square more frequently. My children can win at Times Square, but they have trouble optimizing the multiple tracks in 1955.

Best small scale two player game I own. A game will range between 12 minutes to 30 minutes - the norm being 20 minutes.
Brilliantly balanced game that allows players to try to keep surprising their opponent and adapting their play when confronted with obstacles and different possibilities. A tug of war to gain control of countries using positioning and cards. 
A couple of odd typos here and there, but you quickly refer to pictures and titles of the cards which keeps the game moving fast.

Somewhat dry abstract (others would probably call it elegant simplicity) - which is unfortunate, as I've yet to find an espionage-themed game that I enjoy, and there's a lot of potential in the area - especially once you get into spy-gear, which this game skirts. 

The gameplay itself works fine - but lacks anything really special to make it stand out. I'd play it if asked, but am unlikely to offer.

There are other abstracts that are more to my taste - I don't rank elegance that high on my list of characteristics.

Very meh. I think it might deserve more of a 5, but really, I just can't see me playing this again. There's just nothing particularly interesting here. It suffers from the problem of many shallow 2-player games where the zero-sum game ends up mostly being a tit-for-tat, and while you can make your cards a bit more effective, so can your opponent. Overall, very forgettable.

Definitely play this game TWICE! The first time I played it there were so many fiddly rules that it confused me. Coupled with my rules confusion it felt very back and forth, and pointless.

The second time around I had a great time playing it, and it went a lot smoother. We got the rules down pat, and the back and forth nature felt more fluid instead of futile. 

However this game feels very unsatisfying to lose. More so than any other game. You end up working so hard to force a country over to your side, and a crafty opponent will snatch it back. My complaint stems less from a "luck" perspective and more from the fact that you work so hard for something that no matter how hard a fight your opponent puts up, it still feels unfair. 

Good game, though. Will play again!

Card driven influence game with a Cold War theme. Players take sides (either Communist or Capitalist countries) and attempt to move markers corresponding with each of the available six countries to their side of the board. If three markers make it across to one side of the board, or a player's home country marker, then the game is won. The markers are moved by playing cards with certain amounts of influence on them and these can be combined if they correspond with the active country. The cards also contain events that can be triggered instead of using the card's influence. Each side also has a spy that can be moved from country to country bestowing more power where they are present such as being able to combine cards or blocking opponent's moves. This is a well balanced game and you can see the influence of 'Twilight Struggle' on the design (despite being a very different game) with the dual use cards and placing of influence into different countries. For people who enjoy that game but have a fraction of the time needed to play it available, this can be used as a (much) lighter alternative that is still satisfying.

Easy to learn, but fun. A bit unbalanced; getting and keeping the 'discard to move' power creates a huge advantage.

*2014  Fun 2 player tug-of-war game.  Haven't played with the expansion yet, but have played a few times with Connor.  Keeping for now for portability and quick play time.

Nice and compact, and plays well for two over dinner.  A decent strategy game that doesn't take particularly long to play.

By no means a bad tug of war game, it can have a tendency to drag on a little too long depending on luck of the draw. While I like the dynamism that the cards generate (no country is ever truly "locked down", lots of tactical leeway), I suspect that I may just not enjoy these kind of games.

"Twilight Struggle"-(really, really)-lite.  An interesting tug-o-war of influence. Fun little tactical filler!

Feels like Twilight Struggle lite, with a bit less theme. A fun quick 2-player game.

This game represents much of what I love about gaming: A small set of simple rules that gives birth to a deep and complex universe of seemingly endless possibilities. 

All you get is one card to draw from a common pile and a worker (spy) to place on a small variety of influence fields, but since each card can be used for many different things and each player can both attack and defend, you will find yourself scratching your head over difficult choices. 

This would be rated even higher if my s.o would feel the same, but I can see the criticism: The theme is admittedly thin, randomness is arguably the deciding factor, and the overall gameplay definitely on the lighter side.

Two players take on the role of Master Spies as they attempt to use their country's resources to sway the people of six countries into joining their faction.
\13\\13\
The two players draw from a communal deck to build their hands in an attempt to create card combinations that will allow the shifting of allegiance in six different countries. Every card may be used offensively, defensively or for a special effect. Careful planning and maneuvering of their master spy pawn results in increased effectiveness of the cards or the ability to trigger an offensive action that catches the opponent off guard.
\13\\13\
A game takes between 15 and 30 minutes for experienced players and between 30 and 45 minutes for inexperienced players. The game is marketed for ages 14 and up.

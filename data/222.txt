A card game for the family, but nothing more than a deck of UNO can't do for you.

Get the same colours out and do the math in scoring on 2 different fields (one after another).Bit of push your luck here.

Pretty good game for the kids with some replay value. Bit of trick taking and luck on draw.....felt nothing more than that.

OK game but boring for me.

Really enjoy this variant on the bean theme.  The cards are funny, and the gameplay is surprisingly strategic.  It can get rather nasty as you can choose to plant beans just to keep them out of your opponent's hand, or it can be really nice if you just focus on your own game and let others have whatever beans they might receive from you.  I've seen both aspects in the same game and it is really cool.  I'm not sure how well the game works with less than 4 players, but 4 seems to work well.

It will take a moment to get used to the feel of play moving to the left while the cards move to the right.  Knowing when to start collecting a color is one of the key aspects of strategy.  Also, it is important to know when to draw cards and when it will only benefit the person you're passing to.  I also like the push-your-luck aspect of playing a set that you will need a few more cards to be able to score.

Oh! The lack of trading and no hand "order" in this game makes it MUCH more appealing to me than Bohnanza!  I really like Bohnanza and I have friends who LOVE the trading aspect, but it feels like a lot of dead time to me and I LOVE the fast pace of this game.  I would MUCH rather play this game over Bohnanza now.

As others have pointed out, how well you do in this game is heavily influenced by whether the person to your left decides to draw cards or not.  It's often a good idea not to draw, but some people don't realize this and always draw anyway.  This puts the person to their right at a large advantage.

Set collection. What makes it like Bohnanza is that you are planting beans and ripping them up under certain conditions. It's an easy game to learn and play if you get the four basic rules settled and passing to the right/playing to the left is not confusing, it makes perfect sense. I suggest that if playing with 6, the VC be dropped to 25 if you want to play it as filler.

RATING: 4
There is no choice! You just react in a completely mechanic fashion. This is very boring.

However, the game can be some fun if you start to parallelize actions, with every player being urged to play as fast as possible and the next player starting as soon as they can, not waiting for the previous player to finish completely. Then you additionally loose if it is your turn twice. 

Don't play sober! Under these two circumstances Space Beans is fun.

Fun enough game with the space theme that appeals to all of us.  I haven't played Bohnanza, but from what I've read about it, this sounds somewhat similar.  Seems to become evident early on that it doesn't pay to worry about what your neighbor is collecting, but to just concentrate on building your own bean fields for points.  Doesn't seem to have a lot of strategy, but we'll see if any becomes more apparent with more plays.

This game has a totally different feel from Bohnanza. I like this one better than Bohnanza. This one gives you more freedom to use your cards and it moves faster without any bargaining or negotiating. At the end of your turn, you give all your cards to the person on your right, so you can't plan ahead.

An interesting variation on Bohnanza without the trading mechanic. The payment mechanism is interesting - you only collect payment if the set of  beans you harvest contains a card with a number equal to the number of beans harvested. The other interesting mechanic - and the only real interaction in the game - is the the fact that you pass all of the cards remaining in your hand at the end of your turn onto the person who played before you.

A set collecting game based loosely on Bohnanza. The basic set collection of Bohnanza is still there, but the trading mechanic has been replaced by something rather different. On your turn, you examine your hand, optionally draw two cards from the deck, must plant spacebeans, then pass your hand to the player on your right! Play then passes to the left (who'll give you your next hand of cards). Certainly different.

I find that Space Beans is similiar to Bohnanza without the trading mechanic. A good reason why the two games looks similiar is because both games are by the same designer.

Random, luck. Entertaining, very light, simple. I enjoy the theme. Takes a bit longer than it needs to be.

I recieved Space Beans in a game trade.

Personnally I enjoyed it better than Bohnanza.

This shares similar harvesting mechanics to Bohnanza but is better IMO because of the lack of trading.  The trading in Bohnanza slows the game down way too much testing my patience.  This one moves along at a nice pace and features some unique mechanics that require you to pass unplayed cards to the neighbor on your right.

Kind of Bohnanza's antithesis. This game works in complete silence and the only player interaction involves choosing what field to add/not add beans to prevent an opponent to getting to them. 

Ok, enough about the game's shortcomings and whether it lives up to expectations or not. This game is a decent light card game that feels rather unique.

This is a fun game in the bean line.  The game mechanic of passing the hand around is very clever --- BUT it makes it so when it is not your turn you feel very out of it.

I was sort of reluctant to play this at first since I thought it was just a spin-off of Bohnanza with a forced theme.  The theme is very forced, but the game is actually rather interesting, and the similarities to Bohnanza are actually very superficial.  This is a completely different game.  It's typical Uwe Rhosenburg, a quick card game with one weird rule.  In this case, at the end of the turn you pass your entire hand to the player on your right.  This sets up a dilemma, do you play the cards you want, or play the cards that the player to your right wants so that she can't have them.  A lot of fun!

A relatively straightforward bean card game.  I'm sure with regular play the sheen will wear off it, but after one play with my son, we both like it. Given the fact i only paid $5 for it, am actually quite happy with this game and look forward to playing again (15/2/13). rating 7. UPDATE: I like this game, a good filler on which to close the night.  Only difficulty is the turn going left whilst you pass the cards right.  It's not overtaxing, encourages social faux moaning when people pass you rubbish. It's not brilliant, but it is a nice enjoyable solid 7 rated card game  (Mar 2014). UPDATE As a final game of the night filler, I do really enjoy this card game with a unique mechanism (Rating 7.838 Jan 17)

A constant drafting card game that is unlike anything else I have played.  Ya gotta put it to Uwe to mix it up a lot with card games.  In some ways I may like this more than Bohnanza.  The trades in Bohnanza can bog down depending on who you play with.  Space Beans still calls for interesting hand management and being wary as to what you pass to other players.  I liked it.

I've only played this game once and it was with players that have either played it or played another game similar. So I felt kind of out of the loop at first and passing the cards counter clockwise while players were taking turns clockwise kind of had me a little confused at times, but it got better as the game went on. I'm sure if I played it more and got used to it, I might have gotten more out of it. It does go fast and seems like a nice filler game for a variable numbers of players.

Rosenberg again does a bean themed game with unique hand managment rules. Unfortunately, this one is even harder for non-gamers to get than Bohnanza's "no rearranging" rule. I love the artwork and the cards are good quality. I would pull this out as a quick filler, but the lack of bartering makes this a bit below the other bean game.

Another stupid card game, with a thinly tacked-on space theme that seems to be more about luck than anything. Bohnanza is much better, with more strategy and theme. I think I'm beginning to hate card games in general...

Update (12/15/09): Now that I have calmed down, this isn't such a bad game after all. Somewhat entertaining, but still heavy on the luck, IMHO. Can't take it too seriously kind of filler if you have less than 60 minutes and six players.

First played March 11th, 2008. Taught in ~5min, played in 30min with 4 players. There is more luck than strategy in this game, however for what it is, there is some strategy in it. Deck consists of 7 color types of bean cards with numbers 1-9 on them(some have multiple numbers of the same color). Goal is to get 30+ points. Each player is deal a starting hand of 5? cards. The start player, draws 2 cards, picks one color, and places in one of two working collections(one is face down and the other is face up) then passes the remainder to their right. Play continues clockwise(left). Players continue to place cards in a face up or face down collection(that match colors) or score a collection. You must always play a card to a collection, so you may need to score a collection if you don't have a match(reguardless if you get zero). If you have a card numbered the same as the number of cards you have in a collection, you score those points(keep the card for scoring), and discard the rest. If you don't have the number and score then you just discard. You may only score one collection at a time, however unscored collections still count at the end of the game provided you have the appropriate card. Play ends when someone cashes in for 30 points. It's a decent filler, however it's not worth the purchase.

A game where the hands are moving.  Players collect beans they want to plant in their fields, then pass the hands to the next player.  Players can cash out beans for money if they have the right numbered card in their collection.  It is really pretty simple, but enjoyable.

This is a filler game with some simple strategic elements. The character art on the cards is nice. Draw 0 or 2 cards on your turn. Then score your face up pile if possible and you desire. Next play matching colored cards into the face down or face up stacks. Finally pass your cards to the right, but play proceeds to the left. Only score if you have the same number of cards that match a number on one of the cards in the pile. There is strategy in keeping your scoring stack playable, but it can get annoying if you are not getting the cards you need. Also not knowing the other player's face down stacks adds to the unpredictability. More players add to the challenge.

I can't stand this game for the same reason I can't stand Bohnanza. You aren't allowed to rearrange your hand and you basically have no control over what happens. If I can't affect the outcome, why am I playing it? How about instead of playing Space Beans, we roll some dice and call the highest roller the winner. It'll save time and we can move on to a better game.

Secret Santa 2007 gift.
Had never really heard of this game before receiving it as a Secret Santa gift.

It is a lot of fun.  Some similar aspects of Bohnahnza but definitely its own game.  There is no trading in Space Beans, and I think Space Beans is a bit easier to explain than Bohnahnza.  
The "pass all your cards" mechanic is pretty cool, as are the scoring rules when "converting" a collection.
This is a card game that will find its way to the table a fair bit with my group, but would also be OK for non-gamers too.

Great Game. Always a big hit, any time it comes out. This game has never failed to please new players, and I've introduced it to lots of folks. I can't believe the low rating at bbg.

I used to play this regularly on the commuter train (Long Island Rail Road). We'd do 2.5 games in 40 minutes (sometimes 2, sometimes 3).

Needs to be played at an exhilarating breakneck speed in order to be appreciated. 3 or 4 players is best, 6 players is worst. (2 players works fine, and 5 is too many - it's only fun if there is a [i]chance[/i] some hand cards [i]may[/i] come back around to you later!)

Feeling a little neutral about this game.

I really wanted to like this game more than I did, b/c I love Bohnanza and I love sci fi, but sadly it didn't really appeal to me all that much.  I'm told it's better when played with more than 2 players though, so perhaps I'll give it another try when there are more than just two of us around.

Edit: MUCH better when played with more than 2 people.  I'll never play the two player version again.  I still prefer Bohnanza, but Space Beans is a fun little game when you're in the mood for something light.

This game has some interesting mechanics which differentiate it from Bohnanza.  I really like the separate public and secret farms, but the lack of trading and the forced "pass your entire hand to the previous player" rule just doesn't make for very entertaining gameplay.  I feel like we're just going through the motions during this game, since you have so little control over what enters and exits your hand.  Probably won't play this one again.

The quirky mechanism (play, pass your cards to the right) provides some novelty value. It introduces some decisions on whether to sacrifice (play cards your right hand player would like) or play your own game, but with only two colours melded and points escalating for more cards, it's nearly always better to look out for number 1 and maximise your own score. Which makes for a fairly random result, though it can be fun along the way.

This card game is another one in the family of Bohnanza franchise, and is very loosely based on that game (similar set collection and harvest features but no card trading).  I%u2019m not sure what this game is trying to be:  a cut-throat, highly competitive and serious game, or a light, fun filler - but it doesn%u2019t succeed on either count.  

Too much randomness and luck of the draw dominate the game, eclipsing whatever little strategy one could muster.  The passing of your remaining cards to your right hand neighbor is a very neat mechanic, but not enough to save the game.  To be fair, as long as you don%u2019t take this game seriously and treat it as a light filler, it is not too bad.

All 2-player games. Substantial luck but room for strategy and tactics for 'weaseling' out an extra few points while denying your opponent(s) a few too. Surprisingly good.

1 4-player game. The 'play-left, pass-right' routine takes a little getting use to but it plays as fun as 2-player. My son thought that multi-player has "less information but more control" than 2-player.

Rating upgraded to an 8, this is a very good 'pure' card game.

Interesting mechanic (passing hands right while play proceeds left) makes for a nice light filler game.  Plays quickly with enough thought required to make the play fun in my book.  Game gains rating points for me in that it is easy to explain and quick to play.  Making it an attractive filler/transition game.  I do like the thought of passing decisions to the next player....do I harvest a worthless field so that I can bury the color my right hand opponent is collecting in my private field?  Granted not every play has such decisions, but they pop up enough to make the game interesting and enjoyable.

Interesting Bohnanza spin-off that suffers from being a bit too long for a filler. It also has a card distribution problem that means the longer you play, the harder it is to win.

I think all of the above could be fixed by playing to (say) 21 points rather than 30, and making the going out bonus 2 points rather than 3.

Nice light/filler game - with a twist.  You goal is to plant and harvest your beans with an open field and a hidden one by building sets.  But there's a twist - after you finish your turn, you pass your hand to the player on your right, while the game play moves to the left.  

Now you have to decide when is the best time to harvest, to avoid passing the colors which your opponent wants.

Fun, light cardgame.  Sometimes I play out of order due to the turns moving one way while the cards move the other.  Some subtle strategy.

Space Beans -- Played four- and six-player.  Luck of the draw plays a large role, but your choices of what to keep and what to pass do determine subsequent gameflow.  The rules are simple, the game duration is short, and the play is quick.  And fun.  For me, that defines what I'm looking for in a filler.  Plus, the artwork is particularly fun for me, as I'm a sci-fi geek.

RATING: 5
Silly game really.  The mechanic of the game (passing the remainder of your cards to your neighbor) is interesting but ultimately makes any planning pointless.  I like planning (or at least some illusion of control over the game) so I am down on this one.

Not a bad shorter length game. It moves pretty quickly, and there is certainly a little tension in whether or not to draw and deciding whether or not to cash something in or wait another turn. Still, I think it would be nicer to cash in either one of the two fields or have a little more decision-making in order to really elevate the game to a higher rating.

Originally, I thought this was an okay, average game ... until our last two plays.  At least one or two folks got within 4-5 points of ending the game.  Almost an HOUR LATER, the game finally finished ... mercifully.  Getting to the end game with competent players takes forever.  It's a shame, I like the sci-fi theme and especially the artwork on the cards (my favorite is the Londo bean).

Doesn't seem like much, and isn't much with 2 players, but 4-6 is very good.  If you can get past the goofy theme, this is a filler to have for light-to-medium gamers.  There's some strategy in there, for real.

When I played Bohnanza I felt like I was doing a long boring arithmetic problem. When I played Space Beans I felt like I was playing a short, simple, fun game. That's a hell of a difference.

RATING: 5
This is very similar to Bohnanza, but without the negotiation.  It means the game is faster, but it loses a big part of the game.  The other mechanical tweaks like passing your hand and having a secret collection were pretty good.  This is an OK filler that I would play if someone else brought it out.

This card game was surprisingly fun.  The mechanic of passing your hand to the player on your left at the end of every turn was very clever, although it was a little tricky to remember that play proceeded clockwise while passing cards was counter-clockwise.  I enjoyed both times I played, and would be happy to play again, although I don't have a strong urge to purchase the game, but that may just be because I only need to so many light card games in my collection.

There was nothing inherently wrong with this game. I just didn't think it was that fun, and there wasn't enough strategy to make up for that. I'd still play the game if someone brought it to the table, but I traded away my copy in a math trade.

A clever game marred by poor graphic design, which I prefer to its more famous cousin.

This game plays quite well as a light filler for 5-6 at a restaurant while waiting for your food to arrive.  Doesn't take up much space and everyone can pretty much play it simultaneously.

I've only played the game with 2 players, and the nifty mechanic of playing clockwise but passing counter-clockwise is defeated this way.  It does have some strategy, but with two players, it's just a matter of playing a set that your opponent is trying to build.  I would like to play with more players to see if it gets any better.

Bohnanza where the trading has been replaced with a 'take that' type thing. A bit of push your luck. Passing cards to right/turn taking to left caused some consternation for some. Love the artwork. Maybe a bit long for a filler.

When I rated it [b][bgcolor=#66ff99]&nbsp;8.1&nbsp;[/bgcolor][/b], I said: Excellently speedy game.  The fact that you're handed your next turn's hand almost as soon as you're done with your turn gives you the little time you need to plan your next turn.  Keeping track of the opposite directions is quite simple if you simply make your play, then gently smack the remainder of your hand down to the right, while looking to the player on your left.

...but the comment is still valid for my [b][bgcolor=#9999ff]&nbsp;6&nbsp;[/bgcolor][/b] rating.  It just doesn't excite me as much as it did then.  ;^)

A very simple card game with quirky, humorous artwork and a slightly strange flow. It's really almost more of a distraction than a game, but not every game needs to captivate your mind entirely. Cute for what it is.

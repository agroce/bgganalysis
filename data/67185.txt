RATING: 6
Collect sets and time your actions right so that you can avoid picking up unwanted cards so that you do not get any penalty for them. That is really the essence of the game with a few surprise elements. I am not sure if there is any greater depth to this game. Rules are straightforward enough to keep the game light. Components are few and setup is simple enough to keep the game fast playing. There is one ruthless aspect to the game however, i.e., only one player gets penalised each round and sometimes this can be really brutal. I have a feeling that the key to success is really in avoiding this penalty as otherwise players tend to score more or less the same amount of points each round. So it might well be that collecting sets is just the facade and the real game is elsewhere. An ok little game, that is all I can say.

RATING: 7
A set collection game with a corruption mechanic wherein if you take a card "ahead of the card" you are entitled to, you must take the intervening cards as corruption in your corruption collection, and there is a corruption penalty at the end of each round.  Rather than take a card on your turn, you can turn in a set if you have it, which allows you to selectively trigger an event, or play a character card with special effects, including certain character cards that effect corruption.  A decent game for two players.

Ancient Egypt.  Score track looks a little like Tutankamun.  Quick paced filler.  Draw first card in row, or tale a leter card and put earler cards in trash pile, which later counts against you if yours is te largest.  Reasonably engaging.

RATING: 6
Egyiptomos kártyajáték, árukat gyűjtünk, majd kijátszuk azokat pontokért. Nagyon érdekesen egyensúlyoz a játék. Aki mohó módon a legjobb lapokat akarja megszerezni, az szükségképpen sok lapot szerez a bünti paklijába, és akinek a paklija a köre végén a legnagyobb, az a körben szerzett pontjainak közel a felét elveszíti. Érdekes a játék, de nagyon sok helyen van belekódolva szerencsefaktor, pl. ha valaki a fent említett taktikát választja, és így nagy a büntetés paklija, egy bizonyos lapka segítségével minden a pakliban lévő lapja után kaphat 1 pontot, ez a mi partink esetében egyszer akár 30 pont is lehetett volna, ami még megfelezve is túl sok. Ezektől a kilengésektől eltekintve a játék kellően élvezetes, sok taktikai lehetőséget kínál, és bár Egyiptomra csak nyomokban emlékeztet, mégis megérte kipróbálni. Ez a sorozat csupa érdekességet rejt (Jaipur, Tschak...)!

Sobek makes a fine, fast interesting game, using the concept of corruption similar to Cleopatra's.  It gives you some choices about the cards to collect, mixed with some special powers.  All dressed up with a nice design and one of the best insert ever.

Kaarten nemen om setjes te maken, en tegelijk proberen zo min mogelijk corruption cards te moeten pakken.
Verder ook tokens met onm uitvoerbare acties of characters spelen.

Scoren doe je in 3 rondes, maar tijdens het spel is het moeilijk volgen wie aan het winnen is.

Beetje saai, regels moeilijk uitlegbaar hoewel niet eens zo moeilijk.  Niet mijn ding.

The thermoformed is just amazing. Yeah. i really like the game... but.. the thermoformed! It's just so nice to look at.

That said. I really really like the artwork (kinda looks like cell shading --> shapes with a thick black outline and no black lines inside the shape)

And the game is fun and might be my favorite "small game" I own...

But I consider this to be primarily a 2 player game. My only 3p game was around 45 minutes, which is TOO long...

Light filler with enough meat to be and enjoyable set collection game. Very simple yet fun game. For me it's best with fewer players as the influence you have with more players it pretty low. Fun to play when there's not enough time left for a longer game.

Fun game for 2-4. Love the scoring mechanic, keeps the game really close. Art if basic and they could of used cards for the tokens, and have them, and the current cards of the characters, describe each ability on the card itself. Lots of room on the cards to do it. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The main problem of Sobek is that soon you get tired of repeat the same three times to complete one single game. You can consider that each game is in fact 3 games in a row and I only want to play one, each round is completely independent only the score is accumulative. Apart from that Sobek is fun but not a great game and definetly best with 4 players.

*update*

Traded because it has too much cards with symbols to be playable with the family without ruin the game explaining the events that special cards and tokens do. On the other hand, this is not a game for gamers so it had no sense in my collection.

Now I play it in www.yucata.de and I have fun playing it.

Now that I have played this game more it has grown a little repetitive. I feel as if every game has too much focus on not being the most corrupt player. Turns and strategy for winning also seem kind of predictable. The game can also go on too long for the type of game it is. Still a good set collecting game, just nothing I need to own.

Love this game. It works as a 2,3 or 4 player. Take the best goods from a choice of 4 but snub the early goods at your peril. Anything taken out of turn goes into your corruption pile. Bad things happen to the most corrupt player at the end of the game. Character cards can be used as goods or played alone to activate their power. A great game, nice balance of luck & strategy. Compact game that travels well. This is one game I keep coming back to again & again.
Tip: the character card powers are not obvious from the image. Printing yourself a reference guide from the download section on this page will improve play!

RATING: 6
Appealing theme, but not the tightest of Cathala's titles. Rushing to collect Ivory multiplies scoring faster then penalties via Corruption can account for, and one player committing heavily to this strategy also quickens the game significantly, yielding other players' moves as largely redundant.

TRADED IT!

Gorgeous looking pieces and box. Solid card drafting/playing mechanics. My two big gripes are the huge point swings from the corruption and the fact that each of the 3 games have no bearing on each other (as no cards or effects carrying into the next). Remove those two elements and the game is a solid 8-9 for me!

I quite enjoy this set collection card game with an Egyptian theme. The few rules are straight forward and easy to learn. But the description in the rule book of the character cards & event is printed in far too small a font--the symbols on these components are not always intuitive and have to be looked up. 

I like the look of the game. The insert is unique to the game and well done. The box is small & fits easily on the shelf. 
The board doesn't lay flat and tokens slide off even when laid down. 

The scoreboard has an interesting twist--there is just one track and each player has only one marker on the track, but the track has both numbers for scoring points, and Egyptian symbols for penalties and events. Markers will be moved up and down using either numbers or the hieroglyphics.

The game is well balanced with choices such as, lay down a set as soon as it is made to gain a bonus event, or develop bigger sets for more points. Also, taking a more attractive card (instead of the first one) places cards in the player's corruption pile which might lead to a painful penalty. 

It is a light family game that is fun and entertaining, and a welcome relief after a Thou-art-heavy game.

RATING: 5
How much risk are you willing to take for getting the cards you really want? That is the central question in Sobek. You want to collect sets of cards, but grabbing those that benefit you most might incur the wrath of the Gods (well, okay, it will just lead to corruption) that can easily eat up a lot of your gains again if you aren't careful.

While this premise makes for some nice tension during the game, the resulting sets (and thus the scores) are largely uncontrollable, at least at the higher end of the advertised player count. Both the initial card distribution and the order the resources appear in seem to have bigger impact than how well you are playing. Okay filler.

Kind'a like it. Extremely tactical. Probably more than Jaipur. On the other hand little bit more interesting due to the special powers. On another hand... hmmm... they are somehow annoying - limit opponents hand to 6... say WHAT? Why?
Corruption penalty mechanism is quite interesting in the set-collection game.

Yes. I like it. I also really like the graphics, it's a pitty that Jaipur isn't as caroonish as this one. I'd like to own it, but still think Finca does all the set collection mechanic better - in the vein of 90' classics I'd say.

Borrows so many pieces from Jaipur that it's tempting to write it off as derivative, but I think the two main changes give it an interesting life of its own, those two being:

1) Early sets give you secret information and big sets give you points (vs. both giving you points in Jaipur).

2) When you take something from the card row, you're usually giving your opponent improved access to *specific* cards (vs. just giving them a lottery ticket in Jaipur).

Features some of Cathala's odd design tics (multiplication? really?) but also has his trademark "this should be a mess but it isn't" mechanical sprawl. I like it.

Sobek is a light, family game that also makes a nice interlude between deeper, more challenging games.  The main challenge is deciding which card to take, and whether it is worth placing cards in your corruption pile in order to acquire an attractive card.  

Don't be misled:  Sobek isn't filled with deep strategy or clever tactics.  It is a rather straight-forward, easy-to-learn game that is entertaining and fun.  Playing just three-or-four turns seems about perfect and doesn't cause the game to feel too repetitive or overstay its welcome.  It has been well received in both family and gaming settings, something which is always a big plus.  So while the game doesn't really capture the enchantment and mystery of ancient Egypt, it is still a fun trip along the Nile.

Based on plays on yucata -- set collection with a neat poison mechanic (i.e., skipping ahead cards means increasing your corruption  -- however, only the most corrupt suffers the steep penalty of receiving half points for end-of-round scoring). Throw in a few early pay-out incentives (to not hoard too many cards), special ability cards (to actively make others who hoard cards suffer, to reduce corruption, amongst other things) and you've got a neat little quick filler.

We found this game to be at its peak when played fast with little downtime. Initially I was a bit confused with the scoring mechanic but it eventually made sense and added the importance of avoiding corruption as much as possible! Our group had fun with this one! I think we'll be pulling this one off the shelf more often now...

Tentative rating after one play (not even a complete one). The corruption system to jump the line is interesting enough (and it felt new and original to me). I liked the game, but it is not an ideal two player game for me. The rules are printed too small, which is cumbersome when you don't know all the character's abilities yet. I would be happy to play this again with more players, while my wife and I probably won't play it again with just the two of us.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (November 2010)

Light game. Some friends really like Sobek and it can be fun with the right crowd, however, I feel there is a lot of uncontrollable luck (I’m aware you can jump to get the cards you want/need, but then you take corruption, a good mechanism, however I still found the luck of the draw to be overpowering) AND it takes too long for what it offers (too repetitive). Due to this I’m not too interested in playing Sobek often. The rules are very easy to grasp and the art and component are good quality. 

Best with two I think.

LIKE:

* Easy to teach and learn, quick to play.
* Variable special chits and action cards bring some excitement and chaos to the game for which you need to plan to some degree.
* Corruption feels well implemented and is an interesting mechanic.  I scored high one round with over 70 points but lost like 35 points due to corruption!

DISLIKE:

* Feels repetitive very quickly.
* Set collection is fairly boring to me.

Sobek can be summarized as a renarrated Cleopatra on a smaller scale, but since it picks the right ideas to repeat, this is a good thing. Taking on a bit of corruption here will not grant you more powerful cards, but a wider choice of cards to take, and since the aim here is set collection, the benefit of choice is obvious. Again, you strive to be just a bit less corrupt than the luckless guy at whom all accusatory fingers will point, but if you fail and end up as that guy, at least you don’t lose automatically. You just get about half of your hard-earned victory points docked, and since the game is played over three rounds, this is not quite as bad as it sounds.

Like Cleopatra, this is lovingly illustrated and will provide a lot of good fun, but just as for its bigger cousin, I’m not sure about its depth and longetivity, and accordingly could not recommend it wholeheartedly.

RATING: 6.5
A good little set collection game with the theme of building a temple alongside the Nile somewhere in Egypt.

My youngest daughter likes this one as it has a little bit of player interaction and take that in the form of corruption and the character cards you play.

Set collection scoring is interesting as is the way the players control the speed of the game. The goods come on boats down the river. Choose a boat card that is next and all is well and good, choose any of the further 3 and you have to take all in front of it (between you and the card you chose) as a corruption penalty. at the end of each round the player with the most corruption losses places on the scoring track depending on how much they scored that round.

The scoring method and corruption calculation sound much more complicated than they are. This is a good simple family set collection game, with enough interesting wrinkles to bear repeated plays. Just make sure you make copies of the character skills so players aren't constantly asking for the rule book to look them up.

Keeper for now as my daughter likes it.

12/11/10 Obtained. Generally I like the (whimsical) art work. Yet I find it hard to tell some of the characters apart without the cheat sheet in the rule book. The rule book does have some errors. I gathered certain items were accidentally left out of the English version, yet appear in the French and German editions. Plus a few rules were just not clear. But the designer/publisher has answered all the questions I had, here on BGG.  The games plays well with 2, 3, or 4.

It's hard to avoid the comparison between Sobek and Jaipur. Same publisher, same format, same theme.
Similarly you either take one from three kind of cheaper or three more valuable goods, or play a set and collect bonus if you do this early. What makes Jaipur tight is the hand limit of seven and the ability to take multiple goods at once. Here you can have as many cards as you like, but some of the characters can screw up your plans, and you can only take the good freely which is currently available; to get a more desired one you have to accept penalty. The gameplay is a bit slower, because it can be played with up to four players, but the game offers a bit more interaction in exchange. All-in-all, if you like Jaipur but want to play with more players, you will probably like Sobek as well.

A simple but challenging drafting/set collection game.  Bascially you're trying to collect sets, you can draft any card available but all the cards you skip past go into your corruption pile.  Whoever has the most corruption at the end of the round receives negative points based on how much they scored.  There are also various multipliers, wilds and cards that are dual-use containing goods and special powers.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
OK card game filler.  

The corruption mechanism is a good addition to a set collection game.  The special power disks I thought varied greatly in power... be sure to sneak a peek early on in the round.  Very light, but the "take that" aspects are entertaining (or not).

The corruption mechanic adds some interest, but I find it quit boring (I only played at Yucata.de, maybe it's better when played live).

Gioco di collezione carte sulla falsa riga di Jaipur ma allargato a 4 giocatori. Le partite si svolgono in 3 round (difficile finire prima anche se c'è una regola che lo permette). Apparentemente casuale, pesca carte, in realtà il gioco richiede un po' di strategia. Piacevole e non troppo lungo ma personalmente credo rimanga il fratello povero (e un po' più brutto) di Jaipur. Rivenduto sena pentimenti.

Sweet Sobek! Another nice medium light card game with a little meat behind it. It is similar in length and enjoyable play to that of Game Works' other card game Jaipur. It has a good bit of set collection, a little bit of screwage and some great components. The box storage is outstanding...as usual! The game comes complete with a board that lays flat, corruption markers, player tokens, cards, and a nice supply of supply tokens...enough so that every game is uniquely different.

RATING: 7
A set collection game with the High Society penalise-corruption rule. The further down the line you take a card, the more corruption you get. The player with most corruption loses points at the end of the round, so it better be worth it. The game encourages you to play sets early to earn bonus tokens, or go down the road of minimising turns playing sets and maximising turns collecting cards. You can play it watchfully or carefreely, but it moves along smoothly because turns are fast - pick up, play a set, or play a character power. Which gives some delay options when needed (nice), but mostly you're picking up. The set collection genre will never rate highly given there always luck of the draft involved, but this is a nice addition and pleasant to play.

A fairly light card game that is not only really nice looking (due to the cartoonish art), but also fun to play. You collect cards and get corruption for taking cards that are not next in line and then have to sell your cards in sets of three. The actions by others affect your selection, but there is almost no down time. Wll worth a try.

RATING: 7.2
Fast-paced game and very easy to gasp. The game mechanisms are simple (score by making sets of the game goods), but also gives you room to have your own strategy. The "conflict" elements between players also fits nicely in this euro game -- I enjoy playing a "reduce your hand down to 6" card and seeing people teasing me for a revenge.

The corruption mechanism is also a nice way to keep the game balanced by not letting a player take a big lead too fast; it usually keeps most players in the game for all 3 rounds.

Solid components of nice quality and very funny artwork. The game comes in a small box and can be carried very easily. I'd recommend it as a light filler, or even as a light game to introduce non-gamers to card games.

Crazy fast drafting/set collecting game.

Typical pick cards from a queue mechanic with those at the front of the queue cheaper than the ones at the back. Very clever way of "payment" as cards skipped over you collect as corruption cards; most corruption yields negative points.

Push-your-luck cleverly intertwined in the game.

Don't know how much replayability this one has, though. Players play three rounds, and nothing carries from round to round except players' score, which makes the game feel repetitive.

Sold it. Was hoping it would be better, because we REALLY love "Tschak!" from the same publisher, but "Sobek" is... well, underwhelming.

We played it mostly as a 2p game and while there are some interesting decisions to make, most of the time you just pick the first card in order, because corruption can really mess with your score. So you get the impression that half of the game is played on automatic mode, no thinking required whatsoever. Sad, 'cause it looks really cute.

Does the job as a little filler game that overstays its welcome a tad, but has some decent choices to be made and is simple to learn, teach and quick to play. It's mostly what you hope for from a small box game from this crowd with this artwork, theme and the box description. I'm quite happy to bring it to the table for a run as a casual and entertaining game. You'll find yourself doing mostly the same thing every turn. With a bit of chaos thrown into the mix the timing and greed factors are somewhat important. Collect your sets. Score your points. Have a bit of fun and move on. Not bad.

A Jaipurhoz hasonló dobozos játék, amit viszont akár négyen is lehet játszani. Kártyákat gyűjtünk és legalább három azonost próbálunk lerakni belőlük, amik a rajtuk levő szkarabeuszok után hoznak pontot. Vannak speciális kártyák is, amiket viszont nem igazán éreztem jelentősnek a játékban. A lapelvevő mechanizmus az érdekessége a játéknak. Bármelyik lapot el lehet venni a körünkben a 9 felfordított, illetve később megmaradt közül, de a kihagyott lapok a korrupciós jelölőnk alá kerülnek. Aki a kör végén a legtöbb korrupcióval bír egy meghatározott mechanizmus szerint visszalép a győzelmi pont jelölő táblán. A játék 3 körös, nem vészes játékidővel. Jobban tetszett, mint a szabály alapján gondoltam, egyedül a speciális kártyák gyengesége rontott az összképen nálam.

Cathala has designed a nasty and fun little game here with Sobek.  
As a two player game : Carefully watch your opponent's pick-ups.  Unfortunately, grabbing the card they need can end up punishing you.  The game requires thoughtful hand management.  Slow playing with tense decisions throughout.  The corruption penalty is brutal sometimes but can be worked around with patience.  Fun and different from the high-flying Jaipur that I was inspired by to get this.   

Corruption management is not so bad if you are not greedy.  For a light game it provides a lot of decision making that changes game to game.  I like it.  

3p : Tough decisions and moments of working corruption onto your opponents.  The first round really makes a big impact on the following ones. I wish more than 5 event tokens could happen but that might really swing the balance,though, I am not sure.  It's long for a card game, but with friends casually, it does not matter. 

[b]Suggestion[/b] : Play without the 2 curses tokens.  It's the only thing in the game you cannot come back from.  I find them quite unfair considering you can get out of any mess in the game with a little work.  The comeback nature of the game is what makes it a hit.  The curses may be necessary in 4 player but we play 2-3 player only.

update : Sometimes just going for corruption can work in your favor.  It's fun to say "screw it" and go for it (and getting the win).

A game I had my eye on for it's positive reviews and the kind of lighter game we like. So it became a minor grail for me. Was well received at the table- quick to learn (even if the scoring gets a little math-y) and the perfect amount of time for a lighter game.

I don't know how this would play with more than two players, and I don't know that I'd really want to, as with two this has a fast, light feel to it that reminds me of Jaipur.

Update: With three, it is a little faster, and possibly a little more cutthroat, but still works really well!

Too simple and luck dependent to be something I would seek to play seriously or often, BUT is surprisingly engaging. I don't know if it's the attractive cartoony art or the fact this set collection card game has some twists (love the corruption pile!) to differ itself from "throw random cards at the table" games, which I hate. I somehow found the point calculating a bit tedious in a game this simple. The winding score board isn't as user friendly as I would have hoped.

Rummy-like card game. The options to screw your opponents make it quite fun.

Sobek is outstanding, and along with London, has become one of the two games from the Essen 2010 crop that I absolutely need to own (given the difference in price points, that makes Sobek a pretty good value!). The mechanics of Sobek are very simple, but the decisions throughout are very difficult. The game is tense and balanced, and gets bonus points in my book because it works very well with two players (and in fact may be best wtih two).

RATING: 6.5
Card game with some neat mechanics, but luck plays a HUGE role. 2 player is pretty much unplayable as the player with the least amount of corruption will certainly win every game. I think this game is so close to being a great game, but the corruption is just too crippling, especially in a high scoring round.

Days of Wonder should have snapped up the rights to Sobek and packaged it as Cleopatra: The Card Game.  Sobek is a nifty set collection + corruption title that brings the spirit of Cleopatra down to a very portable size.  Print out the last page of the rules four times and you'll have the player aid that the box is lacking.  Sobek is heavier-weight filler perfectly executed.

Falls in to the same family as Jaipur, but not really.  Less elegant, with more interaction, and a bit longer playing time.  They are different beasts, with a little bit in common (come to think of it, maybe its just because they are published by the same company).

A speedy and rules-lite set collection game with a unique reward/punishment mechanic that keeps you planning. As always, Game Works goes above and beyond with their artwork, component quality, package design.

A mean little twist on set collection, it reminds me of Klunker in that regard.  The event tokens help reel in runaway leaders, and there are lots of oppotunities to manipulate the tableau and game conditions to thwart fellow players.  

Excellent components.

A nice alternative to Jaipur, and it even supports up to 4 players! Not sure how well strategy works with more than two, having more than one person between you and that next card your need might be a bit more random than I'd like. Will have to give it a try and see.

Provisional rating, one play.  Expected to enjoy this, but didn't.  I think it's that I see the card queue as a puzzle that is fun to solve, while the attacks from other players' are an annoying interferance.

RATING: 6
One play, and it was kinda fun, but also felt fragile.  I think that might be due to the fact that we had a three-player group.  One player surged to an overwhelming lead, and there was no chance for us to catch him.  Getting a big set of Ivory can put you so far ahead as to be ridiculous.  Perhaps we could have done more to shut him down, but it was hard to say how.  I do like a lot of the other aspects of the game.  It's a perfect length for its depth, it's got great art, interesting decisions, but it doesn't feel like the soul is gone, as is the case with so many other set collecting games.  I'll give this one another try if it comes up, but I'm not going to seek it out.

►COMMENTAIRE(S) ABRÉGÉ(S):
± THÈME : plutôt plaqué; mais agrémente le jeu.
+ Icônes : sont faciles à comprendre ou à mémoriser.

►REMARQUE(S) PERSONNELLE(S):
Jeu où chaque joueur incarne un marchand tentant de se procurer des marchandises afin de les vendre au chantier du temple de Sobek (Points de Victoire). En cela, afin de mettre la main sur les marchandises les plus précieuses et espérant ainsi augmenter ses bénéfices (PV), un marchand peut user de sa capacité de corruption mais doit alors éviter de devenir le plus corrompu d’entre tous (perte de PV).

Personnellement, je suis nulle en calcul mental et ce jeu est une vraie plaie en ce genre :
1e- Former des séries avec certaines cartes comportant un(des) symbole(s) « Scarabé » et où, lors de chacun des 3 décomptes de fin de manche, il faut multiplier chaque série séparément (nb de symboles « Scarabé » x nb cartes) avant de les additionner. De ce fait, si une série n’a aucune carte avec un symbole « Scarabé » alors elle vaut 0 point. 
2e- À la fin d’une manche (juste avant son décompte), chaque série d’au moins 3 cartes encore en main peut être posée devant soi mais se verra appliquer un calcul de pointage différent (réduit à 1 point pour chaque symbole « Scarabé », si présent, mais sans multiplication).
3e- La piste de score, qui comporte des cases numérotées et des symboles, et où la corruption se traduit par un malus pour le joueur le plus corrumpu de la manche qui doit alors reculer d’un certain nombre de symboles; ce nombre étant calculé en divisant son pointage de manche par 10 (ex : si 25 points de manche pour le joueur plus corrumpu, celui-ci devra reculer de 2 symboles identiques à celui de la case sur laquelle il est arrivé précédemment en marquant ses 25 points).

►JEU(X) COMPARABLE(S) ESSAYÉ(S):
> « Cléopâtre et la Société des Architectes » (2006) : du même auteur (Bruno Cathala) et à l’origine des mécaniques de cartes visibles/cachées et de corruption qui ont inspirées Sobek. Dans CSA, la corruption consiste, en fin de partie, à jeter aux crocodiles l’architecte-joueur le plus corrompu avant de désigner le vainqueur parmi ceux encore en vie.

Like Jaipur, GameWorks' other small-box game, Sobek has a pretty straightforward gameplay, but has some trickiness to it that belies its cartoony artwork.  It's not a deep game, by any means, but it has some nice decisions to make over the rounds, and they aren't always the easiest decisions to make.  It reminds me of other simple-but-challenging games that don't tax the brain, like Crazy Chicken or Penguin.  The hand management, and deciding when to take a card or when to play a set, is perfect for a filler or a game to try with casual gamers.  It's competitive without being cutthroat, and allows for some neat manipulation of actions and cards to create some big moves.  Very satisfying.

Straight-forward, easy-to-learn game that is entertaining and fun. Playing just three-or-four turns seems about perfect and doesn't cause the game to feel too repetitive or overstay its welcome. Ideal for family gaming and filler.

RATING: 7.4
Very nice simple game, fast enough, good filler.
There is a good number of interesting choices to be made, probably 2 or 3 different strategies to try, limited interaction (but you can play some veeeery nasty tricks).
It is very very well balanced and i just see one problem: the luck factor is a bit too high for me.
The different ingredients seem not completely original or better, they aren't completely new but surely they are uncommon and feel innovative enough.
I'd play it again happily

Lekker vlot en simpel kaartspelletje, waarin je snel genoeg moet zijn anders is je kans verkeken.

In dit spel moet je setjes verzamelen van verschillende kaarten. Deze leveren punten op naar gelang het aantal en de waarde van deze kaarten. Echter, als de goede kaarten voor jou niet vooraan liggen kun je er voor kiezen om kaarten in je doofpot te stoppen. Maar kijk uit, de speler met de meeste kaarten in de doofpot loopt kans flink wat punten te verliezen aan het einde van de ronde.

Set collection card game with a few cute twists, like the ability to jump ahead in the card draw (for a penalty) and special characters which are drafted bindly. It's a very clean design and everything from the adorable artwork to the fitting if overused theme help make it a keeper in my book.

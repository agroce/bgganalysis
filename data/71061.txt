Interesting dungeon crawl with the ever-present, "you could die any moment" feel to it. Personally, I like that. Others, not so much. I like the new edition from FFG a great deal... but I'll use the combat mechanism from the old version instead.

Nice and fast game! Only takes some 30-45 minutes per game. But I still would have hoped more of this game: Lacking the dragon figure itself plus other figures... And the combat method is very basic, stripped down. Anyways this game has it's rightful place in this universe!

Knasspel som jag ändå tycker är roligt, ibland. Det finns inte några moment som behövs fundera över. Illusionen om egna val är total. Enklast sättet att vinna är att ta första bästa skatt och försöka ta sig ut. Reglerna är alltför krångliga. Man hade kunnat göra tabeller av vad som händer. Striderna hade kunnat göras snabbare. Hela spelet borde gå snabbare att sätta upp.

This is a quick fun game, I like push your luck games and the fact that you can die on the 1st second or a few hours later makes it very exciting. if you don't like luckfest games steer clear this is a beer-and-pretzels game at its best and does not pretend to be anything else.

[1-4] First play: trap right at the start, gradual amounts of encounters brings me to within 3 health of dying, have an unstable potion that is begging to be drunk (for better or worse), manage to get into the treasure chamber and collect 4,000 gold, torch goes out for almost all remaining turns as I try to retrace my steps, manage to survive the last trap right before the exit (poisonous gas) with the chance of sun going down if a 1-4 is rolled....  and a three is rolled.  The door slams right in my adventurer's face and the dragon eats him in the dark as he pounds on the tower door....

Absolutely GREAT game.

RATING: 2
This entire game plays itself and basically boils down to "how did I die this game?". I wish I could call it a roguelike but roguelikes at least have a sense of progression when you aren't horribly being maimed. Most of the time, you're just frustrated, waiting for the game to stop screwing you. Plus the downtime is atrocious with more than 3 players. The combat system is interesting and innovative, though it's too long-winded for a game like this. Every single aspect of this game is random. This game doesn't deserve the beautiful components it was printed on.

The only thing saving this from being a BGG 1 rating is the combat system, since the rest of the box doesn't contain a game.

RATING: 2.5
I've played this game now 5 times and found it to be the most frustrating game I own out of over 1000 games in my collection. It is hugely luck intensive with virtually no way to help yourself from getting stuck in a rut. Twice I only entered two squares into the dungeon and got hopelessly trapped and killed. With so many tiles available to put down on the board and only place a couple and then die in a few turns makes it a horribly exasperating game. Sure you could get very lucky to only draw the ideal tiles and cards but in my view a game needs to have a more balanced level of luck. There are also cards you can draw that kill you outright. It has a lot of very cool pieces that make up the game but someone needs to do an entire redesign of the game rules to have it become an enjoyable experience. There are a number of optional rules in the back of the rules booklet to try and I've tried some of those to make the game easier but without any success. The game designer must be a sadist. I'll try to avoid any games made my him in the future!!!

Played first game with my wife - neither of us are thrilled with the card combat system so we are going to try some of the dice variants. Funnest part for us was/is laughing at the others misfortune in this brutal dungeon. 
Played 3 more times today - 1st game I was able to make it to the dragons stash and back out! I had super lucky tile draws. The dungeon absolutly punished my wife for three straight games. Not sure if she will ever play again. LOL

RATING: 3.1
Utter crap.  To be fair to the good friend whose copy we played, he did warn me it was "some random stuff happens and then we all die".  But even then I was unprepared for just how sh*t this game was.  A game will often win me over after one play, but it's rare when a game will lose me so badly after one play that I won't ever play it again - this one managed it.  I can't find a single good thing to say about it.  You get to make lots of decisions in the game, but they have very, very little bearing on what happens to you.  Don't get me wrong, I like a game with a random element or two - it keeps things interesting - but this was almost entirely random.  I was slightly bored after the first 15 minutes, before anything bad happened to my character, but after 2+ hours of random events happening I was actually pleased at my character's demise.  If I want to play something THIS random for over two hours, I'd rather play a couple of dozen games of Cthulhu Dice or a few games of Killer Bunnies or one long game of Fluxx that never seems to end - that should tell you something.  My friend wants me to give it another try sometime, but given the number of unplayed games we have, new games we might buy and [i]good[/i] games we own, I don't see myself even remotely interested in ever trying this again.

RATING: 7
It is beautiful game with a dominating factor of luck.
If you're lucky will survive coming out of the dungeon, with a precious treasure, and before the sunset and wake up Dragonlord Kalladra.
During the game, you are looking for the entrance to the room where is the treasures and you are passing the corridors of the dungeon where there are several tests that contain monsters and traps.
The combat system with cards I liked enough, but there is a variant to do combat with dice too.

Good fun, but the game does not have the feel of the original and is lacking something. The combat system is overcomplicated and the backs of the cards are quite hard to differentiate.

Too random, with the potential to sit and do nothing turn after turn as you wait to pass a skill check.  Even if you play where you are knocked out instead of dying, it's not very fun.  The best part is making it to the treasure room and seeing if the dragon is awake, but it's not a very interesting game.

Wow.. Great game with the right folks. Play this game with time gaps between game  and it will be fresh every time. If you play it over and over every night you learn the decks and the odds of items coming up.

Keep it fresh.

I like the fact i can use heroes in Runewars and Descent.

An excellent roguelike boardgame. Some plays are quick enough to consider this a filler.

I think the combat system in this version is just fine. The rule book makes this a difficult thing to learn, but it's really simple.

There are five card "stacks". Each combatant has a damage stack and a stack of cards in play, making four  stacks. The fifth stack is the combat stack where combat cards from previous rounds are accumulated.

1. Each player in combat gets a random power card.
2. Five combat cards are dealt to each combatant.
3. Each combatant selects a card and places it face down.
4. The combatants reveal their face down cards.
5. If a combatant played a card that has a counter attack symbol the color of the card their opponent played, that combatant can add more of the same color card they played when combat started to increase their total.
6. The combatant with the higher total in their stack wins and adds their played combat cards to their opponent's damage stack. If a tie occurs, all cards go to the combat stack.
7. The loser moves their played cards to the combat stack.
8. If there are any cards in the combat stack with the same color as was used to win, the winning combatant adds those to their opponent's damage stack. 
9. If the total number of cards in a combatant's damage stack is equal to or exceeds the combatant's health, that combatant is dead. Otherwise, draw back up to a total of six cards and repeat step 3 until a winner has been declared.

Not for the faint of heart. Or those who don't like player elimination... in the first round. Or those who don't like randomness. Basically, not for those who don't like fun... This game needs beer and people who don't take stuff seriously. It's quick (if you don't play with the stupid card combat), fun and great for trash talking your opponent while getting horribly killed by a trap on your next turn. Get in, pack some luck, don't get killed, get out in time. Love this game.

I confess, I pretty much bought this game solely for the Descent figures. Apart from that, I don't really enjoy the game all that much, you have very little control over what happens to your hero, and I don't think I've ever seen someone reach the dragon's hoard and make it outside.

Fixes the original game's issue regarding the importance of stats (IE Agi is no longer the only stat you care about). Upgraded the combat system (card based combat over rock, paper, scissors).  Still very unforgiving in terms of winning, you still only care about making it to the dragon and back without dying, score be damned. *Great with 2*

Like a mouse to cheese on the trap...I bought this solely to get the six heroes for Descent.

9/1/12: We just finished our first game of the new version of Dungeonquest. I got my head chopped off. There aren't alot of games where you can go from full health to zero health so easily.

The new combat system is greatly improved...it is much more interesting than the old plain paper-scissors-rock.

After I died I had just as much fun watching the others try to get out alive. Oslo got a good draw in the Dragon's Chamber, decided to risk one more draw (he had to draw two dragon cards because of his Harp treasure), and then made it out with a few turns to spare thanks to a teleport rune. Jamie was close behind. He spent many turns in the Dragon's Chamber, and ended up with a bit more treasure than Oslo. He might have had enough time to make it out, but I fought him as a demon and that was the end. Rio had quit after the fourth turn or so, upset about how poorly things were going.

The new combat adds little, and brings the game to a screeching halt. Use the Rock-Paper-Scissors method of the previous editions and it's still a fun diversion.

RATING: 8
Very luck filled game, but so much fun and so addictive that I don't mind. The rule book is unnecessarily long and in depth; new players can easily be introduced to the game and adequately prepped to play with only a few sentences. Move your hero and select a tile to add to the board, or search the room your hero is in and draw a card from the appropriate deck. Follow directions on cards.
Combat is needlessly fiddly, so I've come up with a simple dice rolling variant where players compare rolls and take the difference in damage. The game isn't competitive enough for anyone to care about strategic card battles that never amount to much more than ro-sham-bo anyways.
Overall, a light game that is lots of fun, and one that I would play whenever asked to -- but I would hesitate to introduce it to no-luck purist gamers.

The new FFG edition of this classic eclipses the old GW version. All the changes that FFG put into this game are for the better and the new combat system is pretty fun. Throwing in the Catacombs rules is a nice bonus and I can't wait to see what may come down the pike for this game. It's as random and deadly as it ever was. And just as fun! 

Adding the Descent and Runebound character cards was a nice bonus,too.

Bumped to a 10. I am having way too much fun with this!

RATING: 5
This game can be fun sometimes. It has a quick pace and the schadenfreude component for the deadly dungeon is high. It's an almost totally random game of press your luck, but it does a decent job of inviting the right mood from the right group of gamers. It can also just lay flat as the randomness makes the game difficult to like sometimes. It can be heaps of fun; it can also be boring; that, too is random. I won't often reach for it, but maybe I keep it around for those nights when you want to play a silly, no-thought game to round out the night.

I have one additional warning: Fantasy Flight's card driven combat - as widely reported - is a terrible match for this game. It slows the game down considerably and seems to deaden the pace like speedbumps on an interstate. FF's online combat variant or perhaps a house rule for dice driven combat is an absolute must. I have my own set of house rules which work well. Without the house rules for combat my rating would sink to a 3.

RATING: 6
I got my chance to play some DungeonQuest, and it was an "interesting" experience. It's totally a silly dice-n-draw random game, and I found it to be a lot of fun. You have to have that "silly" attitude going into it, and just roll with the punches. Mock your opponents at every opportunity, shake your fist at the dice gods and relax. I say "interesting" because I cannot believe the ridiculous combat system that shipped with the game. A single combat can easily take 20 minutes (bear in mind that with four players an entire combatless round was usually 1-2 minutes, max!). Anyone not in the combat gets to sit there and look good, and wait. Part way through the first combat, I hit the FFG site, grabbed the dice combat variant and we never looked back. Combats took about a minute to two minutes then, and everyone had a great time. I have no idea if the combat system ever got play tested, or if the FFG testers are so.... convinced.... that FFG rules are fine, but they really, REALLY needed to give some clear feedback and FFG needed to listen. I agree with all the reviews, the combat is awful and feels totally unneccessary and tacked on. On the whole I enjoyed it once we did the dice combat and will certainly play the game again, but I have no need to own it and will be adding my shrink-wrapped copy to my stock and selling it. Oh yes, in both games the dungeon kicked the tar out of us, but on the first game we'd progressed to the point where we were rolling to see if the dungeon sealed us in and killed us all... two of us made it to the rooms before the towers and only needed to move to leave the dungeon.... and the doors slammed shut. Terrible way to die...

FFG did a great job in remaking this wonderful classic! The new art is great (although I still love the old one) and it already includes the old Catacombs expansion. You only get six heroes though wich is a little disappointing compared to the 13 heroes of the old edition (if you have the Heroes expansion).
No matter what edition, I loved it now for 30 years, and it will always be one of my favourites.

Has some minus points (the non state of the art combat and sudden death occurrences) but I don't mind them as long as everybody around the table is up for grabbing some loot and getting outta there before a certain eeeevil female (what else!) dragon bathes him/her in bad-breath-smelling fire (or die trying)!
It's a different take at dungeon crawlers and a solid solo AT experience as well.

Nicer components than the original, but the usual FFG rules treatment ruins it. The new combat rules are a needlessly complicated addition that slow down the game, and adds the pretense that there is some sort of strategy involved in what is (or should be) a purely chaotic luck fest! Use the original rock/paper/scissors combat rules if you play this edition.

Based on the rules inside the box, I would rate DungeonQuest a 6, but using the Dice Combat Variant rules that Fantasy Flight Games provided (and can be downloaded on this site), the game improves dramatically and is worthy of an 8. Just remember to toss those combat cards out and play with the Dice Variant rules!!

Yes, DungeonQuest is cruel and random, but that is why it is so damn fun and addictive. 

My friends and I don't play DungeonQuest often, but when we do, we typically play upwards of 4 or 5 games in a night. 

*Bonus: if you own any other Fantasy Flight Games that take place in the Terrinoth setting, you can use your DungeonQuest characters in those games. These characters are especially useful in Runebound. 

**One last thing that is not often said about DungeonQuest, is that it makes for a fast and tense solo experience. Sometimes it can be fun to just press your luck and see if you can beat a game that is literally designed to kill you. 

If you can't tell,I love DungeonQuest. The only reason I didn't give it a full 10/10 is due to lack of depth in the gameplay, and the combat rules provided in the box. If you are to play the game using the combat cards the game is TERRIBLE, but using the Combat Dice Variant rules provided by FFG, the game plays exactly as it should. Buy the game and use those rules!

I love this game.  I hate this game.  Smartest move is to go to the first or second room, find a corpse and plunder it, and then head back out.  You'll win a goodly portion of your games.  Otherwise, it is death, death, death served up on a cracker.  Not sure why anybody would play this stupid game.  But, oh, I'm waiting for my next opportunity....

Death around every corner is an understatement.  It is a lot of fun, and the re playability is high.  I can see that expansions would add variety to cards and experiences.  The catacombs seem to be an excellent way to get around.  FUN!

RATING: 8
3 plays (2px2, 5!x1) with additional entry of replacement characters (no sun reposition) when a player's character dies--so sort of 11 plays.  Out of the 11, 2 characters survived--several others came quite close to exiting with loot. One was just about to escape when the doors closed.  Nooo.... Great time. Please note I play this with a "beer and pretzels" attitude.

So far we've been using this fast and clever dice combat variant: http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/59822/alternate-combat-dice-variant . We've used color-coded 12-sided dice with it as it suggests, but I also want to try 2d6s.

I love how the dungeon layout appears and sometimes builds its own diabolical rationale--like a fragile plank over a chasm into the dragon's lair--which is more difficult to cross back when your character is heavy with stolen loot.

(Played the Death Can Wait variant, didn't think it was quite as good an experience.  Better, to me, to restart a new character without resetting the sun.)

Tense, frightening! Excellent fun experience game, great characters with mix of strengths and weaknesses, fabulous evocative theme and theme-rich mechanics, with more choices than I thought. I think I will try to make this a regular pub game. My rating could rise. Thank you Fantasy Flight.

This is the heavy cerebral train game of high-luck high-theme high-fatality dungeon crawls.

I recognize that this game has some turn-offs: high luck factor and a lot of things out of the players' hands.

But we've really enjoyed playing it as a cross-generational game with the kids.  The combat rules are a little obtuse the first time, but otherwise the rules are very accessible to young ones.

The theme really grabs them, and the game doesn't take long to play. Most of our games are less than an hour.

This has been a pleasant surprise. I doubt I'd take it to play with an adult game group, but it will continue to see regular play with the kids.

I liked the concept in general, and most of the mechanics, but the combat system really put me off. It would be far better if it also factored in your character's attributes.

After playing two proper games after almost two years since I first played, I have to reassess the reason I like (sort of) this game. It has the worst of the worst of the ameritrash mechanics, no meaningful decisions at all, and a horrible combat system. I can wax poetic about how good game design trumps theme, and how well-thought mechanics are infinitely more important than anything else, but for all I can say, this game will forever remain a guilty pleasure for me. I can appreciate it the same way I can appreciate The Room.

Improves upon Drakborgen Legenden. Battle mechanics have been made slightly more interesting and streamlined. Also more lethal than Legenden bringing it back to the glorious days of the original Drakborgen.

This is the quintessential push your luck dungeon game. You can die on the first turn (which I have) and survival rate in the dungeon is like 15%. As long as you ignore the stupid card combat and use a custom die to resolve combat, this is the perfect game. It doesn't pretend to be anything else; it is a push your luck dungeon crawl. It's hilarious. If your character does make it out alive, you have lived an epic story worth regaling your descendants by writing something along the lines of "There And Back Again: A Greedy Dungeoneer's Tale." And when you die from arousing the dragon from its slumber in the center of the treasure pile or by stumbling upon a bottomless pit or swinging death blade, or running into a giant centipede, or by stepping into a trap of some sort, it will be hilarious. Getting a journal to write down high scores and writing obituaries is essential! It's entirely luck-based, and it doesn't try to be anything else, and it's wonderful.

Never played the originals but I like this game a lot. As soon as I saw how many pieces/decks/characters/etc., I had to buy it.

The combat of the system is a bit confusing and seems out of place. Basically war.

The first couple plays were, "Wow, the catacombs make this a breeze." Then it turned into, "Get me the heck out of here!" Followed by death. Some of the ways to die seem a little cheap. I have fallen to my death in the bottomless pit on the very first move of the game...but I guess that's the price I pay for going after loot. Also, on that note, don't expect to win big. You might be lucky to get out alive with just a handful of treasure.

Anyway, I rate this as one of the better games that I own and my group seems to want to play this all the time.

RATING: 8
Brutal quick to play dungeon crawl that virtually demands you push your luck at every opportunity.  Quick enough to play that player elimination is not really a bother (plus they can pick up for the encounters card game and stay involved - and laugh at everyone else struggling to stay on the warm side of mortal).  I've seen a lot of negative comments regarding the card combat but thought this really wasn't a problem, it is easy to understand and swiftly played out.  However with the variants included you can tailor this to your needs.

A very deadly dungeon crawl with fairly simple mechanics. Combat is a little clunky, but not too hard to pick up on. The game rewards ruthlessness but interaction between players is very limited and never usually occurs between the players' characters. Due to the deadly nature of the game, some players may have their characters die just a few turns in due to a bad roll. Have to be able to take it all in stride.

A theme-heavy press-your-luck game.  I was looking for a dungeon crawling experience, but didn't feel like this really provided that.  I think that I'm just going to have to get my dungeon fix by way of video games, because I have yet to find a boardgame that offers an adequate experience.

RATING: 6
The artwork and concept of this game are outstanding. The reason that I rated it a 6 is because of the games combat mechanics. Combat is done through a deck of cards that seems amazingly random to the point that the stats your character have little to no effect. If this game used dice based on your stats it would be at least a 8.5 in my book.

Good quick game where everyone knows it's just a matter of time before you die.

Makes people try to get the big bucks instead of win the game by searching for a bag of coins.

Pointless, frustrating, and futile.  Mercilessly abuses the elegant rock-paper-scissors mechanic.  Even the worst dungeon crawl game you can think of is a work of genius compared to this mess.  No one wins.  No player interaction and do decisions to be made.  Simply awful.  UPDATE.  Watched the new FFG version being played at Gencon and I had forgotten DQ's biggest sin: it is slow as hell.  God watching this was a bore.  Anything this utterly random and punishing should be brisk and not the tedious, cumbersome, and plodding chore it is.

RATING: 8
Tragically, I suffered through a moronic patch in the late-80's when I was too cool for board games.  As a result I didn't pick up the Games Workshop version of this.  I've been kicking myself up until yesterday when I finally got my hands on Fantasy Flight's gorgeous new reprint.

After one play I've decided that I love this game.  It's a gut-bustin', dungeon crawlin', knee slappin', crypt plundering, monster slayin' good time.  There are no pretensions here.  It's just plain, unadulterated fun.

I love the fact that characters creeping around in Dragonfire Dungeon feel like gnats cautiously edging along a conveyor belt mounted with spinning blades, spiked walls, cutting lasers and hydraulic presses.        

The components are top notch, it plays quickly to completion, the rules are clear, and the combat is a flavorful mini-game compared to the original.  Each tile and card draw is rife with close calls or horrible dismemberment, all of which adds up to a humorously gruesome good time with heavy doses of shadenfreud.

Probably could be alright if it wasn't so highly dumb.  The completely random board with so many one-in one-out routes led to not much being explored in my game; too easy to dead end.  And combat is just plain silly.  Not to mention a complete lack of intelligence in the system to decide whether you get something good or bad.  Hell, you don't even get anything good for defeating a tough monster but perhaps living.  Why are there no rewards for tough battles?

A fun game, right up to the player elimination.  Actually, not really even fun.  Too many Empty Rooms, Traps-you die, etc.  I know it's about competing against the game, but it's just not that fun.

Players represent a hero, and enter a dungeon to try and pinch some treasure off the sleeping dragon.  Originally a Swedish game, then a Games Workshop game, now this is back again in 2010 as a Fantasy Flight game.  This is a totally random dungeon hack that is huge fun, if you don't mind a large dose of pain.  Room tiles are randomly drawn and you plod your way through.  If you're lucky enough to reach the treasure room, you draw treasure tiles until you can't take it any more (ie. the dragon is about to wake and toast you).  Then you beat it out before the sun sets and the baddies come out to play.  The winner is the player who gets out with the largest treasure... but just getting out feels like a win.   The Fantasy Flight remake is well done, but the fluffy combat system has been made more mechanical, which somehow breaks the flow of the game, when compared to the original. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Somehow it is even worse than the original DQ.

I think that extending the combats into a more convoluted form makes the game slower. This prolongs the pain of the original's dumb randomness.

RATING: 8.3
Definite improvement over the GW version with the exception of combat, but that is easily remedied with either official or unofficial alternatives. The new catacomb rules in particular make the dungeon even more chaotic. 

In my first game, my wife got to the dragon's lair and then all the way to the other side of the board via two catacomb tunnels.

RATING: 5.5
On the plus side, the components are terrific, the Terranoth theme is a solid fit, and the rules are very well written, laid out, and organized. We played our first game after only a cursory scan of the rules, referencing the appropriate sections as needed, and everything fell into place easily due to the excellent organization of the rules. I bumped my rating up half a point for this aspect alone.

On the downside, there's really not much of a game here. Draw random tiles, roll dice to generate random numbers to make attribute checks, draw random cards, some cards allowing another random card draw (traps, crypt, treasure and door decks, etc.). It feels like the game basically plays you.  There is only a small amount of actual strategy involved, and only a handful of meaningful decisions.  

I'd say the target audience for this one might be children, except that the high ratio of casualties to wins seems like it would be too frustrating and sadistic, esepcially for younger games.  So I'm not sure who the target audience is for this one.  As something light and random, I might still play this one occasionally.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Very dynamic game with too much randomness for my taste but with very interesting mechanic underneath. It is reincarnation of a classic board game, this time placed in Terrinoth setting, which I am not very fond of. The goal is to find way to the central chamber of the dungeon, steal as much treasure as you can without alerting the dragon and run away. And you must do it before sunset or the dragon is going to wake up and eat everyone inside.
Everything about the game is random: dungeon tile placement, exploration cards and resolution of the encounters. It can last anything from 5 seconds to forever and it's very easy to die no matter how good your stats or equipment are. Combat is fun but a bit too long to set up and involves some planning and it's rock-paper-scissors based. It's a quick fun chaotic game of luck and no wits.

To date I (we, our gaming group) have enjoyed each and every Fantasy Flight game we have played. In fact, by and large, we like most all games that we play and we have played many (50+). Not to mention we trust BGG and the rating on this game is good. I say all that to preface this statement that I don't use lightly. This is one of the worst games I (we) have played. This is the most chance strategyless games I have played since Bunko. Even if you are a fan of Bunko you won't like how arduosly long or quickly futile this game can be. Here are just a few reasons why the game . . . lacks.

Chance: Chance is okay if it can be offset by strategy, but that is not the case here. Like other dungeon creation games, you draw a tile and place it on the board and experience its effect, the affects can range from nothing to death, literally. There are also random encounters which range from nothing to death. By contrast, Runebound (I know, not a dungeon creation game) has different colored spots with different leveled encounters, you know the risk and can build your character to handle the higher risks. That leads me into the next problem.

Character Development: There isn’t any! You can’t get bonuses to strength, luck, or your other attributes. You die just as you entered the dungeon (and you will likely die). Tied to this, when you encounter a monster, every other dungeon crawling game I can think of rewards you for defeating the monster, not this one. You get nothing for defeating a monster, yes that’s right absolutely NOTHING!
Death: Unless using alternate rules (which we did) when you die you die. The game rules try to cushion the blow by saying your ‘character’ dies, but you are still in the game to control the monsters, which just means you have to stay there to be the game mechanic or the other players can’t keep playing. Oh and they appear by chance . . . rarely.

Combat: I can actually see some potential with the combat system (in a different game, not this one). Just keep in mind it has NOTHING to do with your characters attributes, just the random combat cards you drew and one of your randomly drawn special abilities (unique to your character). Combat can be fairly tedious to the other watching and there are no rewards (see Character Development comment above).

Long story short: If you are looking for a game like, Runebound, Descent, Tallisman, this is nothing like them (not even a ‘Lite’ version of one). Even on its own merit it just lacks as a fantasy game and is really just a game of Bunko with a ton of extra game mechanics and a fantasy setting. Just sit back, go through the motions, and prepare to be un-entertained.

Fun, if mindless and over-the-top, press-your-luck game with a darker feel than most of the FFG Terrinoth stuff. 

My recommendation is to play with the variant combat in the back of the rule book. The convoluted card combat in the base version slows the game down by introducing too much deliberation into the experience, making it especially frustrating when the game kneecaps you randomly. This is a game where you want to enjoy your random kneecapping.

There is a lot going on in this game. Of course it's a beer 'n' pretzels total luck fest, but if you go in with that assumption, you won't be disappointed. Tile laying was a 'meh' and it seems too easy to die and have to wait for the game to finish. I wouldn't be against playing it again, as even with the weird combat system it's not a terribly long game, but I doubt I'll ever own it.

I love this game. Not much more than disguised bingo, but it may be the perfect dungeon crawler. Teaches you not to take your plans too seriously because, in the end, all is in vain. (In this sense, it could be compared to Galaxy Trucker.) No other game has the same capacity of spontaneously generating funny stories that will be remembered by the players for years to come. FFG's card-driven combat rears its ugly head once again, but the remedy is simply to play the official dice combat variant, or one of the nice unofficial ones you can find here at BGG. Another downside: the game is vulnerable to a very competitive player, who will simply hover around the exit and leave the dungeon after finding a couple of treasures. Point-wise this is probably the dominant strategy, but totally spoils the fun of this classic. The official rules should prohibit winning without reaching the dragon's lair. (The revised edition has introduced a rule limiting the number of searches per room, which should correct this problem.) But at the end of the day, what really keeps me from playing DQ as much as I would like to is high setup to play time ratio.

12/21/10  Didn't expect to like Dungeonquest but I was wrong. Maybe because I knew I could die on the first turn or maybe because of what happened...

12/21/10  David and Andy died early. I made it to the Dragon's Lair and got the Sunstaff. On the way out, I tried to bribe a Dark Elf but had 2 fight.

12/21/10  I then got bit by a vampire in the catacombs and was slowly dying. I drank a mystery potion and healed enough to escape.

12/21/10  Mike found more treasure, but didn't make it out of the catacombs before the game ended. I love games that tell fun stories!

The long anticipated modern remake.  FFG largely left the original GW version intact - a good thing.  Sure, they tinkered with the combat system, added some not so lethal variants, and threw in the Catacombs expansion for good measure.  That I can totally live with and I see why they did this to cater to a modern audience.  I got what I wanted - DQ with FFG style production.  It is still random as ever and insanely hard to make it out alive.  Thanks FFG for bringing this classic back.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
They reprinted the classic!  Lots of fun, and it's hilarious to randomly meet your death.  The stories that this meat grinder has to tell are awesome.

I think the new combat is cool, but it doesn't belong here.  It belongs in some other game.  There is a variant by FFG that puts the game back to the RPS-style game and speeds up combat.

For example, you can have a nail-biting back-n-forth combat with a Skeleton, parrying, feinting, both of you trying to land that deathblow.  Finally, after a brilliant counter, you land the killing stroke.  You walk into the next room, fall into a bottomless pit, and instantly die.

Uh...

Anyway, fun game, the sort stories are made from.  The combat revision is a mixed blessing, a nice system but it really belongs in some other game.

RATING: 7.5
[b][i]DungeonQuest[/i][/b] kills heroes. You will die in this game for being greedy, foolish, or just unlucky. This means if you're doing well and have managed to steal some treasure from under the dragon's snout, you're going to think long and hard about risking it all for one more grab of plunder. This makes DungeonQuest seem realistic, if such a term could be applied to a fantasy game where you steal treasure from a dragon.

Games are quick (especially once people start dying) so early death isn't terrible, but I think I like it best as a solo experience trying to get as much treasure as I can without dying. I don't recommend the included combat rules--they're too slow and brings an otherwise quick-playing game to a halt--but FFG has published official combat variants on their website that are better. The game has many types of decks (search, treasure, trap, crypt, ...) and I think it would be a better game if these were consolidated. These complaints aside, DungeonQuest is a great game that I always enjoy playing.

I love this game, but I am not a fan of the new combat system, with the cards in this reprint of the game. I think it makes the combat a more interesting, but a lot longer than it should be. This game is meant to be played for the fun and laughs and is meant to be a shorter type game. Game time is extended by quite a bit with the new combat rules, which can be very difficult to learn at first.

Now that I understand the new combat rules. I don't mind playing this one every now and then, but would more likely pull out my original copy more often.

So far only played once with 2, three times in a row solo.

This game is silly, but it's a ton of fun. Combat is super fast once you understand it. Yeah, I guess it takes a little longer than a regular turn, but anyone talking about "5 minute combat turns" must have some seriously AP players in their group.

Replay seems pretty darn good. Yeah, you see the same cards every 3 or 4 games, but you see them with different characters, at different times, with different life totals, etc.

Yes, it's not high strategy. But the game is a blast. My wife enjoyed it too. At this point we're 1 for 5. Yay for death!

Easy, fast-paced, very fun game if you are willing to accept it's totaly random nature. Card - based battle system, mostly luck dependent but it gives a unique flavor.

Dungeonquest is a tense, light dungeoncrawl (in a way), in the dragon's lair. Get in, grab the treasure and get the hell out before the sun comes down. And beware... most of the times a hero enters, he won't live to see another dawn.

I'm glad i have it in my collection.

One from the old school. I'm really diggin'  all this dungeon love lately.

As for gameplay, it's pretty fun, but extremely random. I don't mind random, but this game might be too random for even my tastes.
I agree with all of the criticisms made about the gameplay mentioned extensively in the forums and reviews. Expect zero control, and expect to die quickly and easily with zero chance of being able to affect those odds. This isn't about pushing your luck at all; it's about getting lucky and nothing else.
The three main attributes of gameplay that I find detract from the fun are;

Combat - It's convoluted and feels tacked on simply to use a card based mechanism. It takes far too long for what it should be in a game that is as quick as this. A simple dice roll  would have sufficed. Why should combat take 5 minutes per battle when combat doesn't add anything much to the actual game play? The point is not to fight monsters, but grab as much loot and get out, so why is the game so combat focused? It seems FFG is really pushing these card mechanics simply to be 'innovative' when it is tired and boring in a game such as this.

Traps and Events - No chance to avoid them, or at least reduce damage from them. Ie. Roll a dice and take X wounds. Unlucky card draw? Well suck it up because you have zero chance to avoid or reduce that damage. This can force you to lose by simply being unlucky, which is ok, but at least give players a chance to reduce or avoid that luck through choices, or even another random roll.

Player Elimination - 'nuff said. Who actually enjoys this?

Aside from these three bad marks against the game, it could truly be fantastic. It's just too bad, because I really wanted this to be a 10.

It's way too random, nearly plays by itself, but it plays quite fast (not counting set up time) and is very amusing to watch your character fall in endless pits or going in circles, as long as one doesn't take it too serious!

Yes, this game is random beyond belief. Yes, there are some cards here that auto kill and thus end your time playing the game for that session. But beyond those aspects, this game is great fun and a challenge to complete, and that is what leads me to liking this game.

I'm a random person, I love games with chance / luck (card game player here), so this game fits well with my play style.

The new combat system is a big change from the "rock paper scissors with a small twist" of the original. The new system is actually pretty interesting, but for this game I prefer the speed and simplicity of the original system. DungeonQuest is a frantic race against time, and the slooooooow card combat breaks that mood. Of course, I never liked DungeonQuest in the first place, so maybe I just want to get it finished as soon as possible.

The down side is the annoying card combat it comes with. Ruins the game pace and sucks too. The 3 cards vs 3 cards of the old game is best... or a dice system that would simplify everything. That's why I gave it a much lower score than the original game.

RATING: 8
In a way, DungeonQuest is pretty mindless: pick a character, venture forth into the dungeon and see how quickly you die. Then again, it is exactly this kind of "push your luck" -gameplay which makes it fun. It´s a little roguelikish in that account: from the beginning the cards are stacked heavily against your survival (indeed you can very much die on your first turn through the right tile draw followed by a botched die roll!), but then again you might just make it! Add in a short playing time and you´ll want to try over and over again.

The one thing this game does need is the right group of players, who know beforehand that they´re getting into a fun and deadly dungeon crawl but not a very analytically challenging game. The other thing would be card and tile expansions, which I hope will be forthcoming.

All games need not be serious intellectual duels, sometimes gamers just want to relax and have a good time. This one does deliver on that account.

This game delivers exactly what I expected from it.   I've played over 30 games and it still makes me laugh at the variety of ways that dungeoneers meet their demise.  The combat card game was a bit of pain at first, but once we got it down, it is fun too - just a bit fiddly.

Yera

se resume en una pequeña frase: 1001 maneras de morir XD

jugando es un dungeon crawler. buenas mecanicas de juego y un objetivo claro: conseguir tesoros y sobrevivir para salir antes de que acabe el tiempo. 

muy variado, buena ambientacion, variedad de acciones. flojea un poco en los combates porque la modalidad original es "un poco coñazo" y la sustitucion por "piedra/papel/tijera" peca de simplona aunque en mi opinion es suficiente para el tono general del juego. 

muy aconsejable para todos los publicos que no les repela el rollo tematico "fantasy RPG"

La edicion revisada saca la tijera y elimina unas cuantas cosas: adios al "combate avanzado" (se deja como normal al "piedra/papel/tijera"), adios a muchas de las normas opcionales y se introducen algunas modificaciones orientadas a que el juego sea un pelin menos puteante: ahora visualizas varias rutas a la vez y puedes elegir la que mas te convenga (mas o menos). 

la del combate la apruebo porque el combate avanzado era un rollo, aunque se podria mantener para los combates entre heroes. la de la antorcha va sobre gustos, a mi en la primera partida que lo probe no me convencio del todo. lo que no me convence nada es el tijeretazo a las normas opcionales, sobre todo al eliminar la de ocultar los botines con lo cual todos estan a la vista de todos, lo cual me parece un fallo imperdonable que ademas desajusta la jugabilidad. 

En resumen: la mejor edicion es la segunda.

Uhm... one of the worst games I've ever played. Yes, this is much worse than Monopoly could ever get! Yahtzee is a pure strategy game in comparison.

Seriously, there is no game at all. The only choice you have is in which direction you want to lay the next tile. If the tile will open the direction you want, you don't know. Then you only do what the game tells you. Draw a card, maybe another and that's it. Oh, did I mention that you can just die because of a single die roll?

Putting this into the trash bin will frighten the trash inside... for sure!

Slowly creeping through this dungeon, knowing that you will most certainly die, is one hell of an experience. Every tile reveals more perils, and it is addictively fun. The only negatives are set-up time (with all the card decks), battling monsters (clunky and slow), and player elimination (because death looms around every corner). Nevertheless, if you go in light-hearted, you will have a lot of fun and a lot of laughs.

It is better than I dared to hope. Awesome! Watch Tom Vasel's review, and every little thing he says about the game is true: It's random, it's short, there's no real long-term planning, you get thrown around a lot and at times, absolutely nothing happens (for which I, personally, am always grateful, because when something happens it's usually bad).

What he doesn't mention is that while everything is very random, it is also [i]predictably[/i] random. Everything can go wrong, and if you take that into account, it's actually possible to plan ahead a bit after all - seeing the chances where they open up, and avoiding complete death traps, makes it more push-your-luck than rely-on-luck, to me.

Wacky fun, a light snack that's perfectly bite-sized.

Oh, and I like the card-based combat, I don't think it's slow at all. I guess that changes when not playing solo, but there is not enough complexity to make it bog down the game I believe. Also, I don't understand how people can make this game last four hours, or a combat twenty minutes, but I guess that can happen depending on the level of AP (what analysis??) of the players.

Yes it's a completely random dungeon crawler with a satisfying exploration part.
The much decried card combat is not that bad (but not that good) and fortunately the Terrinoth setting is not that invasive.edit: actually, the combat subgame is not bad at all for two players; with more, it simply does not fit, because it takes to much time; the average turn is less than one minute, so the down time for players not involved in the combat is disproportionnate.   
However, with the die variant, this game shines and the beautiful bits are a welcome upgrade to my old version.

The default card-based combat mechanism wasn't as bad as I'd been lead to believe (I actually quite liked it), but I'll probably try some of the other official variants next.

Really looking forward to playing this with a bunch of other players and a few cheeky drinks.  I think it will be a riot.

Seems more like a solitaire game to me, especially with player elimination. Really, this is multi-player solitaire.

The combat rules are needlessly detailed for such a random game. They're interesting, but ultimately slow down and detract from the quick play of the rest of the game.

RATING: 2
If you like random crap occurring every turn, vicariously enjoy the screwage of your opponents, don't mind that you have a snowball's chance in hell of surviving, and that you have very little input on winning, then this game is for you.

This is supposedly a very simple, straightforward dungeon crawl, that has been re-imaged by FFG. Production is top-notch FFG through and through, but reminded me of Runebound and Arkham Horror with miniatures and counters and tokens and chits and card decks oh my!

The objective is similar to Incan Gold, a push-your-luck game trying to get as much loot and get out, before getting killed. The game is brutal, where one could get killed at any given turn, by some totally random, unpredictable event or monster. Where's the player interaction? Every player for him/herself, in a race to get to the center treasure hoard and get out alive. Thus, there is no synergy of the individual heroes' capabilities because there is no "dungeon party". This is multi-solitaire.

The dungeon exploration mechanic is similar to Drakon, where random room tiles are laid out in front of the adventurer where the direction arrow on each tile must align with the point of entry. There's a larger variety of rooms and corridors; however, each time a room is entered, or a door opened, a random event may occur. Thus, the feel of the game to me is more like Munchkin.

The combat system is idiotic War on steroids. There is a combat deck with ranks varying from 1 to 4, and three "suits" or types of attacks. If your card rank is higher than the monster, you inflict one pt of damage and vice-versa. If you are losing, but your suit "trumps" the other card (a la rocks-papers-scissors), you can then add additional cards to win the current combat round and inflict points of damage equal to the total number of cards played. There is also some "killing blow" mechanism, which is hard to understand and explain, but at this point, I don't care.

I picked a fighter-type hero, which had characteristically tons of hit points, lots of strength, poor dexterity, excellent armor, and lousy luck. What was very disappointing was that these character attributes (any of them) had ABSOLUTELY NO EFFECT on combat. However, I did have a personal "deck" of combat cards to draw from (only one card, however), each which had some special ability, but that was all the differentiation I had from the monster. Otherwise, we drew combat cards from the same deck, which reminded me of FFG's re-imaging of Cosmic Encounter, another design I despise.

The attributes come into play when my hero is wandering through the dungeon and the random events occur. However, one must roll equal to or under the attribute, which can range from 3 to 8 (?), on two dice. Armor absorbs hits from traps and other unfortunate situations. I spent three turns not doing anything, because a random event said my torch light went out, and I had to roll a 2 or 3 (my luck rating) on two dice before I could continue. The to-roll number increases by one every turn, so eventually a character will recover. On some events, however, failure on the saving throw is instant death.

So, the game is stupid-fun, like War is stupid-fun, or like Munchkin is... whatever.  The game is not even remotely exciting, even with the boat-load of cards, mechanics, and chrome FFG has slapped on. Having grown up and GM-ing with Metagaming's Advanced Melee, Advanced Wizard, and The Fantasy Trip (which eventually matured into GURPS), where the attributes are directly responsible for how well the character performs, I expected more from a dungeon crawl game than a bunch of random event/trap/monster/etc cards. It makes me want to go through the basement and dig up the TFT system and show others how good and simple a dungeon crawl can be. Heck, Drakon, with all its randomness, has more depth requiring thoughtful, tactical play, and is a far superior example of a dungeon crawl, than this bloated, chaotic, draggy design. This is one hour of my life I won't get back.

How can life be like a game?

Well, if you lived next door to a pie factory, owned a gun and were immortal, then your life would be exactly like [i]Dungeonquest[/i].  Every day you would wake to the maddening smell of fresh, hot pie; you would load your gun and hop the wall only to

[i]get in a firefight with the geriatric security guard and catch a hot one in the neck

make it through the window above the jacuzzi-sized mixing tubs, briefly

get "raspberried" by a robot[/i]

And so on, forever, because while guns make you brave, pies make you stupid.  And immortality makes you eternally susceptible to both.

[b]First play:[/b]  The card-combat mini-game was like hitting the pause button on the game proper to do this other thing, breaking the flow of play.  It got to where one person was complaining every time combat occurred—since it stopped the game dead in its tracks—and I learned to dread any combat.  Not because it was necessarily deadly or scary, which would be nicely thematic, but because it seemed like such an incongruous bolt-on interruption of what was an otherwise hilarious character grinder.

[b]After 11 plays:[/b]  While the card combat looks weirdly complicated at first, it gets easier with repeat plays.  Still, the setup, play, and cleanup just takes too long and feels at odds with the spirit of the game.  It is literally possible for the person doing the cleanup to still be sorting & shuffling when their turn comes back around in a full 4p game...  Ultimately we ditched it for

Got it and it is everything I remember and more.  Having the Catacombs as a built in part of the game is nice.  The Terrinoth setting is no big deal at all, and actually the fact that FFG included character sheets for the DQ chars to use in Descent, Runebound, and Runewars is a very nice treat for the fans.

On my very first turn, I pulled a "Bottomless Pit" tile.  20 years  after playing the original DQ, I still have the same luck.  I wouldn't have it any other way...

Love playing this solo.  I did add a few things.  First I used the dive battle variant (much quicker and better for solo experience). and I added item cards for stuff you find on creatures you have killed.  I even printed my own deck of cards.  Fun but very difficult to beat.

DungeonQuest is just crazy stupid. I have fun playing it, though. Using the geek's recommend rating guide, I guess it's firmly planted at 6.

Great little meatgrinder.  Use the "Heroes Never Sleep" variant so three people don't watch one guy play for an hour after they die in the first five turns.  I've never played the original, so can't comment on the combat debate, but I quite like the cards, and it allows for some psychological bluffing and deeper strategy than is immediately obvious (especially with respect to Deathblows).

В сумме DungeonQuest претендует на то, чтобы считаться игрой для отдыха. Отдыха мозгов, тела, души. Для кого-то она вполне может стать неплохой настолкой для семейных развлечений. Эта игра проста, воздушна и легка. Тот, кто ищет излишней замороченности и глубины, скорее всего, будет разочарован. Всем остальным она наверняка понравится.

A fun if somewhat random dungeon exploration game. One player found a clear path straight to the center, got treasure and got out. Another got turned around and barely made it back to where he started. I got a path to the Catacombs on my first tile and went down to try it out. I then spent the entire game wandering the length of the board until being killed by an ogre. Wouldn't mind playing again, staying out of the catacombs this time.

This game is one of the most irritating games on earth!  We played with 2 people.  It took us playing 3 times, and using alternative rules, for one of us to finally win.

I usually despise extremely high luck and randomess especially together but then that is the whole point of this game and at least you know that going in. 

The interest for me lies in the challenge, apparently the game is DAMN hard to beat and of course its FUN just trying because of all the kooky bad stuff that tries and usually succeeds at killing you.  

Probably good for a few laughs as a very light late night ender although there might be other games that scratch "that" kind of itch better like Space Alert. On my list to try one day.

Great single player game. I can either win big or die horribly. I played 3 games in less than an hour because I died so fast.  Go figure.

I've also played a 3 player game...It takes way longer than the one player..and combat can drag.  This game would be best played with 3 players if one person acted as the keeper of the monsters and the other 2 were the heroes.  That is just a thought though.

Initial Rating : 8.0

I was very surprised by this game . I know a lot players who dislike DungeonQuest so, naturally, I had very little expectation but when we played it, we had lots of fun. For me, the theme is a very important factor in which games I play and this game has an awesome theme, plus excellent art and components. 

However I have only played it once. In our game, neither player got killed early by the game but I have heard the rumors that this happen often and I can see how that can put off a lot of people, but for some (masochistic?) reason I like that feature :devil:

The game has little (perhaps none) strategy, but it is fun to play. 

The 8.0 rating was applied based only on the theme, components and fun factor, however, this is not a game I want to play every time, so I’m downgrading the game to a 6.5, a rating that reflect better my current feelings toward the game. Still I would love to own it :D. 

DungeonQuest is not a game for everybody but it is fun to play from time to time. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
This is just as fun as the GW version for me.  The added bonus is having the catacomb rules included in the base game and that the character cards for Descent, Runebound, and Runewars are included in the box. I like the combat system better than the original - at least there are some (albiet small) decisions to be made.  My only wish would be a little more variety in some of the decks, though this will most likely be fulfilled by an expansion or two.

I'm assuming a "Heroes" expansion must be in the works.  I hope they follow the same path of including components for all of the "Terrinoth" games.

This is a neat tile laying, push your luck treasure hunting game. I really liked exploring the dungeon and the tension of not knowing what each new room would bring.

I've played both the new and GW versions of this. Yes, the combat is a little odd at first but really, stop complaining and actually pay attention to how to play the game. It is really simple and all the crack-job people that are bashing this game because of that really just don't understand what a simple system it is. Basically you are trying to beat your opponent on numbers alone, "IF" you match symbols, its on like donkey-kong and you can take someone out right there by being able to throw down your entire hand. 
1st play of the new version and I was killed on a bad dice roll. LOVE IT!!! I've played this at least 20 times since it came out and only made it out with treasure 1 time!  Brilliant!!

Although this version is good the Gamesworkshop version is better. Fortunately they gave you the rules (Although online) for card battles like in the prvious versions. The combat rules that come with it tend to slow the game down a bit and also seem a bit too serious for a toungue in cheek game.

Unfortunately this does not look like it will be seeing any expansions which is a shame really. With some expansion characters mixed up with different powers this game could really shine.

Nice fun little dungeon romp.  However the combat system even though it is a nice mechanic, does not belong in this game at all.  I wish the game had just used the dice for combat and then all the combat cards could have been converted to cards for the other decks to help keep the game fresher.

*Edit* This game would easily rate an 8 probably if the aforementioned Combat Card thing had never been included.  That many extra cards in all the other decks would really have helped the game stay fresher.

Az első XI. századi társasaim egyike, pontosabban a második ;). Hozza a régi jó kis kaland-játék-kockázat könyvek hangulatát.

Cél: Behatolni a dungeonba, esetleg eljutni a sárkány barlangjába, és a többieknél több kinccsel a zsákban kijutni, még mielőtt lemegy a nap.

Nagy eséllyel nem jutsz ki, de nem fogod röhögés nélkül kibírni sem a saját, sem a többiek haláltusáját. 

Nincs is szebb pillanat, mikor a következő terembe lépve a terem csapda mivolta által az 180 fokkal elfordul, de túloldalon nem vár más csak a fal, és rejtekajtó sehol. Vagy mikor az utolsó életerőddel megpróbálsz átkelni a szakadék felett átvezető farönkön, de hát fáradtan és ügyetlenül (éljen a rosszul megdobott képességpróba) már csak zuhanás közben gondolhatod, hogy miért kellett neked kincskeresésre adnod a fejed :)

És igen, lehet 1 arannyal is nyerni, ha te vagy az egyetlen, aki élve kijut a dungeon-ból :)

Újrajátszhatósági faktor nagy, mivel a kis dungeon lapkáknak köszönhetően, amit egyesével húztok- és raktok fel, mindig más és más dungeon alakul ki.

2017.09.09. UPDATE:
A 4. kiadásban a harcrendszer változott, leegyszerűsítették egy 3 vs 3 kártya kő-papír-olló módozatra. Vélhetően a játékot akarták vele felgyorsítani. A karakterlapok is változtak (pl. Hugo esetében kellett is, mivel pont a régi harcrendszerre volt skillje). Alapvetően se nem javít, se nem árt a játéknak, de tényleg gyorsabb lesz a harc. 6 harci kártya és az új karakterlapok nyomtatásával adaptálható a 3. kiadásba.

Too random. Takes too long to setup just to be dead in the first tile.

The components are REALLY nice. Now I just need a rule set to make it fun!

Some of the optional rules in the manual make a bit better. 

We found the a HUGE bottle of Jack Daniels made the whole game better. (Not a good rule for the under 21 crowd in the US).

If you like the FFG Card sleeves...that will add an additional element of random chance to this game. As the cards will CONSTANTLY slide off the table and all over the place! The cards are small and don't stack very well in the sleeves.

I've never played the original. I was hoping for something between Warhammer Quest and Descent with some random tile draws, but I guess I'll have to keep waiting.

In general, the game is a good improvement from the original game. When I read the rules I agreed with almost all the decisions they made. Like for example, the determination tokens. I you own the original game, this is a tough choice, I am not sure if you should buy both.

So they stayed somewhat fidel to the original game, they did not add stupid euro mechanics. They put the card effects on the card instead of constantly refering to the rule book. Finally, they used some material from the expansions of the game, primarily the catacombs. 

So you almost get the basic game with the expansions, except that you only have 6 characters. But there is nothing to worry, people are making plenty of characters which I think are being imported from descent.

Now, the bad things about the game. First many people objected to the combat system. I wanted a different combat system but I think it is literally too complex and it breaks the pace of the game. So FFG released official variants to the combat system which includes the original combat system from the first game. 

The second problem, is when you travel in the catacombs, the amount of tiles you deviate can be problematic in some situations. Like you could move 1 space you can deviate 6 space (in extreme situations). So I made a new deviation table based on settlers of catan dice system and it should work fine.

Finally, a problem that both games has is the high level of randomness versus the low level of decisions. This could make some people never want to play the game. My suggestions was that the game should give an illusion of decisions (like in Cosmic Encounter) or the illusion that the player can succeed. So that the players can feel that he is not being controlled by the game even if his decisions has little impact on the game.

Still, if played with the right people, who does not want something too heavy, the high level of randomness will not bother them much. If you are playing with heavy thinking gamers, that might not be the game for you.

DungeonQuest is a terrible game. It's almost completely random. There's no strategy you can decide on, and no way to implement it if there were. There's player elimination, sometimes right off the bat (in one game we played, Matt nearly got killed on turn two.) Some of the characters have lousy ability scores, and if you happen to draw a card that tests that score and fail, the results can be devastating, through no fault of your own. The task presented to you is insanely difficult, bordering on the impossible, especially given the timed aspect of the game and the little control you have over your fate. Usually a person can win through a perversion of the rules that goes against the spirit of the game. The new combat system gives your enemies the opportunity to hit you much harder, and very few chances to escape them. DungeonQuest is, in the words of Thomas Hobbes, nasty, brutish, and short.

I LOVE it.

It's really just a game of either move and place a new tile or search. The rules are wonderful and every tile is simple to understand. Skill checks are a simple "roll two dice and hope you are equal or less than your score"; though failures are rewarded with determination tokens for your next try, which means eventually you will pass.

The catacombs are a side game like affair that really can make stunning advances or escapes in the dungeon.

Should be played quickly and with as little thought as possible. Its totally random and often times totally insane!

A fun hour romp that no one is likely to survive.

[microbadge=419][microbadge=670]

DungeonQuest is a hectic, uncontrollable, deadly, and insane adventure.  The game plays quickly, which is good, because nothing but bad things happen, and bad things happening slowly would be even worse.  What is fun is seeing those bad things happen and trying to react to them as adeptly as possible, which is generally not very adeptly.  The combat system packaged in is a good system, but somewhat distracting from the principle game; the downloadable "classic and simple" system is a good, but not always necessary, alternative.  Finally, packaging the game with the corresponding character cards for Descent, Runebound, and Runewars is a cool move on FFG's part.

I know this is just supposed to be a beer & pretzels-type experience, but ugh.  I generally don't have a problem with randomness in games, but this one felt WAY too random, and even worse, repetitive.  Very little player interaction.  As a narrative, it's barely coherent.  I mean, there must be better dungeon-crawls out there.  How anyone derives pleasure from this game is beyond me.

it's fun and exciting, but i can't give it a 10 because sometimes it's just too damn hard.  there are too many ways to get killed immediately, and that's no fun.  i do enjoy playing it though, as long as i remove the instant kill cards and traps from the game first.

Not a particularly good competitive game, but a good way to while away the time with a few drinks. Our first game of this, my wife got a curse that killed her if she rolled a double-1 at the start of her turn, and this happened on the 5th turn. Luck is the overriding determining factor in this game, but the cards offer enough variety that it's a reasonably fun experience.

I got this to have something to play with some of my nerdy-non-gamer friends, and chose this over Talisman for that role. That's a decision I'm happy with; Talisman tends to go on for far too long.

In DungeonQuest, players must guide their heroes through the twisting halls of Dragonfire Dungeon in pursuit of unimaginable riches hoarded by the Dragonlord Kalladra. Whoever can amass the most wealth and make it out of the dungeon before the closing of the doors seals their doom will emerge victorious. However, merely surviving the harrowing dungeon is a feat all its own...

A fun game if you like getting your salad tossed by a chain gang. Seriously, the sheer brutality of this game is hilarious.  But it stops being fun when you think you have a chance to win.

RATING: 7
As silly, chaotic and sheer fun as I remembered from its predecessor of yore. Directly implementing the Catacombs expansion into this new edition was smart, since it increases the decision factor a bit.

The same goes for the new combat system, which is to me the biggest incentive to actually buy this. Pimping the package with character sheets for games I already have and love is a very smart marketing move, indeed, but one I have resisted so far.

Let's be honest, this game isn't going to be for everyone. It is 100% luck driven, and really only a few meaningful decisions to make. So people who like to strategize, and control their own destiny in a game are bound to hate this game.

But if you can take a step back realize what the game really offers, then you can and will have some fun with it. It is about the thrill of the story, or trials and tribulations of a quest, and it is definitely about seeing how your friends die! This is best when played with 4 people as you just get to see so much wacky stuff happen to your fellow dungeon dwellers.

Yes some people will die early...and then they will have to sit there and watch. The combat reads as really clunky and confusing, but once it clicks, it works well enough and can be somewhat exciting.

Just sit back and let the game take you where it will...thats all you can do, but at least it's a fun journey.

Take a good helping of Candyland, a dash of Snakes and Ladders, throw in a some Rock, Paper, Scissors and what do you have?  A recipe for one of the most random games and biggest wastes of time you will ever encounter. Not only is it almost completely random its also very boring. They should have left the combat the same as the original, from what I've heard the original's combat was just as random just less painful. I wish I could have my 2 hours of life back!  :( Played at Gencon 2010.

Good:

Bad:

Waaaaaaaaaaaaay too much randomness. Random cards multiplied with random dice rolls means you can't really plan out reliable strategies.  
Combat is overly complex for the nature of the game. Cards are played face down and can be combed if certain symbols/colors are played. Why not just use dice?  
Turns can go slow, especially when there is combat. 

Played this one with two different groups and no one really cared for the game.

Cool idea, but unbalanced play.  The random room tile exploration is interesting and the figurines are cool (nice bonus that you can use them in Runebound and Descent with the included character cards for those games).  The treasures are cool as is the idea of the time limit.  However, the traps are ruthless and can kill you at random.  You can easily get stuck in an area with no way out, wasting time going in circles.  And going down into the crypt is an exercise in frustration and annoyance - wasting valuable time trapped until you draw an exit card, being constantly attacked or having to skip turns.  Probably worst of all is the overly-complicated deck-based combat system which is confusing, boring and out of place for a game like this (not to mention takes forever, boring the other players).  Combat needs to be greatly shortened and simplified.  The game's focus should be on exploring, not combat.  Not fun, but could be fixed with some house rules to make it more forgiving and make combat quick & simple.

In my opinion the fact that you can die on the first turn of this game and this game includes player elimination make this the worst game of all time in my opinion. The combat system is one of the worst to come out of Fantasy Flight and I can only think that the biggest selling point of this game is to get the character cards for the miniatures that come in the game to use the characters in either Runebound or Descent or Runewars because the rest of this game is just NOT FUN! 

But for people who really, really, REALLY love, and I do mean LOVE... Press Your Luck type of games... then people who love these types of games MIGHT like DungeonQuest.

I think the purpose of this game is to test whether you have a sense of humor. A decent summary of the game might look like this: 1-Something bad randomly happens to your character; 2-Repeat step 1.

It's random, silly, occasionally nonsensical, often deadly and can end quickly. But it's fun, so long as you're not an uptight fan of, well, you know what kind of games and have the ability to laugh.

If you can accept this for what it is, it's enjoyable.

Pointless game with no decisions to be made by the player (except for combat). Each turn, I drew a tile, which told me to draw a card. Lose hitpoints. Next turn, draw a tile, draw card, lose hitpoints. Next turn, draw another tile, draw another card, lose more hitpoints. Dead, out of game.

Aside from the choice I made of which character to be, I did not actually have a single decision to make in this game and got eliminated without ever having a single opportunity to affect what was happening to my character. 

One might say, "Ah, but that's the point! It is a fun game where you slog through a dungeon and random things happen to you!" I agree that it is a pointless slog, but not with the "fun" part.

Birthday Gift 2011. Stupid-awesome dungeon slaughter fun.

Lots of moving parts for something so simple, and I am a bit irritated at how needlessly complex combat is. Still, I think this technically counts as a narrative game, since it isn't really about winning, but about the insanely horrible things that happen to you while you try. That makes this a game that I will enjoy every once in a while, but not necessarily something I will want to play every day.

BTW, I am particular happy about the bonus cards that can be used in Runebound, Runewars, and Descent.

----------------

Update: With the official combat dice variant, this is just about the perfect light, fantasy narrative game - full of hilarity and violence and shoddy luck and terrible, horrible events that combine to make the whole thing a rather wacky comedy narrative. Without the dice variant, it bogs down too much. So 7 out of the box, but 8.5 with dice.

------------

FOR TRADE INFO: Missing minis, expansion cards for Runewars, Runebound, and Descent.

I really enjoy this game.  One to four players are sneaking into a dragon's lair to try to steal as much treasure as they can during the day while the dragon is sleeping.  However, you run the risk of awakening the dragon, and there are all sorts of nefarious and extremely dangerous obstacles and baddies throughout the tunnels.  Oh, and if the sun sets with you still in the dungeon, the exits seal, and the dragon will wake up and eat you.

Some people don't like this game because it can be brutal.  On more than one occasion, a hero has fallen into a bottomless pit two spaces into the dungeon and died or been a step away from escaping and having the swinging blade kill them.  I say that if it was easy, the dragon would have been picked clean long ago!  I really enjoy this game, but you have to have a sense of humor while playing it.  (oh, and we have house rules to deal with the sudden death syndrome that get you right back into the game without losing the thematic element.)

The 3rd edition of a most enjoyable classic: this DungeonQuest is different in many ways, but still retains some of the feel of its predecessor (the GW version).

Includes aspects from older edition expansions already built in (such as the catacombs), but is sadly ruined by a horribly long-winded and over complex new combat system (which is extremely poorly written and explained too by the way FFGs!).

Also has the parts for making characters of the game compatible with Descent, Runebound & Rune Wars (cool).

My Personal Best: 1401g
House Best: 2381g

The combat system spoilt the game so badly its been shelved for a long time (nearly 2 years!).

I have finally taken the steps to mod it into salvation- I've chopped up the character sheets to leave just the raw stats and life (no special abilities), I've switched the life around so that the characters are more balanced with lower stats having better life.

Lastly I have made the following changes to the rules: Draw 2 Runes at beginning of game instead of 1, no escape from monsters, combat is draw a monster counter to determine monsters strength, then roll that many times against monster's skill (Skeleton/Agility, Wizard/Luck, Golem/Defence, Troll/Strength, Demon/Strength), taking one damage for every fail, no damage for every pass, and two damage if you fail/pass AND roll doubles. Simple, quick, efficient.

These changes have saved my copy from eBay heaven. I'd rate 3rd Edition 4 as is, 6 using one of FFG's combat variants, and 7 using my own mods.

Very very annoyed that FFG have just released a 'revised edition' which is basically the same game but with tidied up rules and the original combat system over the rubbish card based one found here- meaning I hacked my copy up for no reason! Damn you FFGs! DAMN YOU!!!

-Lots of fun but in order to have that fun you need to have a friendly, not uptight group where unfortunate and terrible events befalling you or your competitors are seen as either hilarious and fun or challenges to overcome to have no chance of overcoming. If you want a game with less luck that treats you fairly and is more reliably going to always make the best man win, then this one is not for you. It does have too much luck and difficulty for a game to take overly seriously. The components are wonderful, however, the new combat system is underrated and enjoyable, the rules are almost crafted perfectly so that they're easy to customize, make variants, or tailor to your preferences in so many ways. It's a luck-filled, danger-laden dungeon adventure that's best with 4 players and though it can be played solo, there isn't a lot of point since most of the fun comes from experiencing the interaction together rather than playing against the mechanics.

Think of it as more of a spectator sport that your part of rather than a test of skill. If you think of it as primarily a test of skill, you'll be disappointed, this is why soloing is not so fun for this game even though rules allow for it.

Update: Played again with all four players and realized it's better than I initially thought. The fun in the game comes from the experience and the spectator sport of it all. It's a very lolz game mixed with an Dungeoncrawl without one canceling out the other. The fun factor in this multiplies with more people and when you're in a more jovial mood. If you want a cold calculating game of strategy you'll be disappointed, but if you want an experience that is paradoxically tense and anxious yet light-hearted and silly, this one will do it in spades. 

Update: Player elimination, almost no meaningful strategic choices, lengthy set up and take down for a super easy to learn medium length game. On paper it seems like it should be a bad game and I don't play it super often, but the theme, the sense of danger, the laughter at all the terrible things going, the sense of doom, witnessing the dungeon "unfold" and racing to get there, almost hopelessly. There's a real sense of fun in it and that can't be denied.

Lots of mostly random fun.

The game hates you and wants you to die.  Your job is to avoid that and try to scrape some measly treasure together before it all ends poorly.

Walked through my first game of this so easily I was initially put off.  I thought I was supposed to die horribly?  Why is my ass so completely not kicked?

Next game I got into the dungeon easily enough and that's where the game got its revenge.  Tremendous fun so long as the people you're playing with understand the fun is not the winning but the struggle and eventual failure to survive.  Literally, the best part of this game is how colorful and painful your character's death will be.

Luck does indeed play a huge part in this game, and boy does the game play mercilessly dirty.

A few house rules can also turn it into a slightly more "winnable" affair.

I knew going into this game that it was extremely chaotic, with very few meaningful decisions to be made.  Knowing this, I thought I could just relax and try to enjoy the experience.  I didn't.  I'm sure that this type of game is great fun some folks.  It just isn't for me.

RATING: 10
It's got about 6 too many decks, 3 too many token types, and far too much luck... but darn if it isn't a blast.

I use a dice combat variant spun off of a suggestion here on BGG, since the RPS gameplay just slows things down. Works great.

Updated to a 9. Really one of the best dungeon crawl games out there--doesn't bog down, knows what it wants to be. Hilarious.

And DungeonQuest becomes my 4th ever "10" rating. I dare you to design a game where you can kill half the players in the first turn. Nobody has the balls for that kind of design anymore.

RATING: 8
Might not be a "friendly" game, but it amuses me every time, and I'm not really a lover of complete randomness in games. It's just funny to see what impossible situations the dungeon crawlers are faced with each time.
I even had a friend that died in the very first tile on his first game, and on the second tile in the next game. We couldn't stop laughing, and he just said "this game HATES me!".

Didn't stop him or us from playing again though, nope.

DungeonQuest is a fun "every once in a while" game of randomness.  This particular version has a completely new combat system that FFG removed in their re-revised version of the game.  (Instead they went back to a much simpler rock-paper-scissors version that's similar to the Games Workshop versions.)

You're probably better off getting the newer version if you like this sort of game.

I love the theme and the basic mechanics, but it's an eliminating game and it's boring to sit watch the others play. I only played this once. Randomness (an unescapable card) killed me after five minutes, after five more minutes the next player got killed and the last and third player could leave the dungeon with the few coins he had found as a winner.

Comment: Interesting beer and pretzels type of game. I initially was so-so on the game, but after re-reading the rules and giving it another fair shake, I actually quite enjoy it. The only thing that is holding DungeonQuest back is the combat system. It's not a difficult system, but it slows the game down dramatically and it more complicated than it needs to be. We've switched over to using a RPS style variant with each player getting 1 card of each color and consulting a chart. It speeds up the game 10 fold.

Extras: FFG Sleeves - Mini American sleeves.

Optimal Player Count: 2 > 3 > 4
Plays well with all player counts. Not really recommended with 1.

Variants Used: RPS style system where each player is handed 3 cards, 1 of each color. Damage is dealt accordingly, with ties doing damage to both sides. Simple and effective.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Hilarious game! It is more of a parody than a serious adventure game. Any hero brave enough to enter the dungeon is most likely to die, maybe even on their second turn! This makes the close calls (like jumping over a bottomless pit with a hero having only 3 in luck) even more exciting!

ps. I am playing with this version: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/59822/alternate-combat-dice-variant

Edit: I sold this a while ago because there was not much replay value left for me. Now after 3,5 years from last play I played it again (a friends copy). And sad to say but this game is still "played too much" for me. I´ll keep the rating though, I have had great moments with this game and 30+ plays is a good number.

Leaning towards a 6 when playing the game with card-driven combat system. It drags the game unnecessary and seems pasted on. Looking forward to trying some of the variants instead because we thought the game was fun.

WTF. Looked so neat, but wow. All four of us went into the dungeon, and worked as hard as we could to get to the center of the dungeon. No one made it. most people died or ended up going hopelessly in circles or in the catacombs forever until death. It's fun if you play it knowing that the point is to play it, not to win or even attempt the purpose of the game. You'd do better to just get one card of treasure from a regular room and leave.

Roll dice to see how your hero horribly dies!

This is a chaos-filled, push-your-luck, Rogue-like dungeon delve with some fun ideas and some serious flaws. The combat system is actually interesting, and it's exciting to see what deadly trap or valuable treasure is around every corner, but this is a 90+ minute game where player elimination can occur on the first turn with the pull of a tile.

I knew this was the basic design of the game, so I wasn't surprised to see this happen, but I was shocked that there were no rules (even optional) to handle this situation: the player just has to sit out for the rest of the game.  Hasn't the board gaming community known that player elimination is poor design for twenty years?

You're not the magical weapon your wield. You're not the experience points on your character sheet.

Wow is this game hard! It's definitely a kind of silly fun getting instant killed by a variety of different nasty traps. I'll admit, I'm not a fan of the proposed combat system and I feel like the dice variants are more fitting to this kind of game. In fact, I suggest using just about every variant listed in the back of the book over the proposed rules. Either way, don't play DungeonQuest with people who will take it too seriously. This game will kill you again and again...and again.

RATING: 8.25
A good friend of mine brought this over and I have played it twice as of this writing.  I must say I have had a lot of fun playing this game - and my second game I died 4 turns in!  Why wasn't I bored to death as the rest of the players finished the game?  I wasn't because it was hilarious watching their stories unfold.

Dungeonquest begins with each player drawing a random character.  Each character has different ability values (Strength, Luck, Agility, and Armor) as well as life points and special abilities.  Your goal is to go into the dungeon, gather as much treasure as possible, and get out alive.  Sounds easy, but its not - only one person out of 7 has survived in our group.

Not to mislead - dungeonquest is a game you can't take too seriously.  You can die in the first room if you have rotten luck.  You likely will die at some point.  If your not a fan of luck driven outcomes, DungeonQuest is not the game for you.  

Honestly, I play DQ more for the experience.  Its fun to laugh with your friends at the absurdities that befall the adventurers, and fun to cheer when they somehow manage to survive.  In this manner, for me it is very much like Tales of the Arabian Nights (another one I like a lot).

6/2011 Have played several more times.  What I wrote previously still holds true.  A fun (and funny) gaming experience with the right players with the right frame of mind.

played at GenCon 2010- died after three turns which is very Dungonquest style.  Different combat system that is a bit fiddly but not bad.  The catacombs are pretty cool addition.  the production is excellent and looks spectacular.  I can't see anything yet to say that this version is worse than the last edition.  The game is just good quick mindless fun.   Great beer and pretzels game and my wife loves it too!  I raised my rating of this a little more because I'm really enjoying the solo aspect of the game.  It's quick fun exploration. It seems recently , if I play some solo I'm go for this game.   I wish there were more characters though

First--I don't know why many reviews call this game a "roguelike". That implies skill, meaningful choices, stealth, etc.

Dungeonquest offers random dungeon exploration, allowing play without a "GM". Solo play is supported, too.

Still, the game is primarily luck, and usually ends with no one winning. It is also common for a player to be eliminated in the first 5-15 minutes of a game that might take over an hour.

Player elimination usually occurs through a single unlucky die roll or card choice. In other words, if you are playing carefully, it doesn't actually matter.

Not my cup of tea.

The way in which the game is played is really cool. After one play I wasn't too blown away by it. I didn't think, "Man I can't wait to play it again!" However, I do look forward to trying it again. We played a 2 player game, and I think with 4 players it may be a much better experience.

This game is just brutal, yet the death of your hero often brings a grin to your face. In 'multiplayer' games it's still fun to watch other players' misfortunes even if you're out of the game yourself. The components are really beautiful. The figures just beg to be painted (and I answered their begging). It's a fast-paced game, with little to no boring downtime or AP.
    
The only reward for defeating monsters is that you didn't die fighting them. It would be better if you got loot or some other kind of reward. There's too many cards involved in escaping/combat, which slows the game down. Luckily 'Official Combat Variants' can be downloaded as a .pdf from FFG's website.

RATING: 8
So why do we even play dungeon crawls? Is it for the strategy and clever mechanisms? Or is it entirely for the stories you tell afterwards? DungeonQuest totally emphasizes the latter, to great effect. It's random, silly, kind of pointless, and incredibly fun. It's hard not in a modern way, but in the classic "Nintendo-hard" way. It doesn't even try to be fair. Dice will go cold at the worst time. Tiles will throw you down bottomless pits. Cards won't almost ever work out in your favor. And it's great. It creates great stories, plays within an hour, and looks really good. Definitely recommended for people who know what they're getting into.

A word about FFG's updates. I've never played the original, so take this how you will. The Terrinoth theme is fine, but I question the choice because it has very little similarity in tone to other Runebound games. The new combat is perfectly fine. Having tried the variant of the original that FFG provided, I have to say I kind of prefer the new combat. But the good move would have been to make it possible out of the box, and not just releasing a PDF of variants later on. Try both, and decide which you like.

You need the right crowd for this. People need to accept they will die and that it is completely random. If your group can't handle that, definitely don't get this game.

People misunterstand this game. This is not a luck based game, even when it has luck everywhere. It is a realistic simulation of what should happen if a bunch of adventurers enters a dungeon. In those terms, this is not a game in which you manage a strategy to win, but one that you play just to feel the hunger for treasure and the cutthroat of getting into a dungeon, and to fear for your life. With that point of view, I should say that this is probably the best simulation of a fantasy setting ever made. No attempt to rationalize a dungeon crawler can be made without corrupting its concept. A game made to enjoy the ride and forget about its goals. The combat system is brilliant, probably the best of the new wave of Fantasy Flight Games' combat system based on cards. Pure fun and excitement.

The roller coaster of games. Keep those hands in the car or you'll lose 'em! I find this game incredibly fun, however the fun is is watching everyone's character suffer terrible deaths.

Really unforgiving, so I've house ruled that if an explorer dies his loot is dropped and a new character starts all over again. Can generate some hilarious events where an explorer keeps running into traps. Haven't played it yet using the new rules, those should make a difference.

Perhaps interesting and novel back when it was first released in the 80s, DungeonQuest really has very little place in the current board game environment. 

You have no control over your fate in this game - none. Everything comes down to a die roll or card draw; either you do well or you do poorly. Players who draw/roll well will progress, players who draw/roll poorly will be eliminated.

The new combat system is an out-of-place slow, modern mini game jarringly off from the fast pace of the main game, yet still manages to allow very little choice in the outcome other than which of the 5 randomly drawn cards you will use - it's a glorified game of war.

In all, I'd suggest skipping this game. I guarantee you have better games in your collection to spend your time on.

Игра разочаровала! Быстрая и "резкая, как понос". Плохо не то, что она "резкая", а то, что на большинство катастрофических ситуаций в игре, возникающих из ниоткуда с регулярным постоянством, нет, как правило, никаких противоядий и повлиять игрок сам на такую ситуацию никак не может. В общем, совершенно не затянуло. Да и когда там успеть затянуть... Были партии, заканчивающиеся на 2-3-ем ходу! "Это не серьёзно!.."  Боёвка хоть и новаторская, но однообразная и скучная. Соло-режим тоже слабенький!.. Больше азарта появляется при игре на очки турниром!

RATING: 1
For someone who likes complete randomness and no real decision making in games (and these people seem to exist), this is probably a good buy.

For the same reason, in my book, this doesn't qualify as a game at all. Randomness can be entertaining if it at least creates a story or some coherent set of events. DQ does not. It doesn't even look nice.

The real reason why I'm pissed about this product is that FF has really topped themselves this time: the game must have been made in an afternoon, never been playtested, hastely been splashed with the signature ugly colour palette and then thrown at the consumers.

And a word for those who buy this kind of shit: if you don't make any demands to the quality of the products you buy, publishers like FF will make even worse games than this. Because they don't care about your gaming needs. Just about your needs and how they can make money off of them.

Fast and fun. Lacks depth, but I have never turned down a game. 
This is a great beginner for a gamenight when not all have arrived yet; I have also not found it to be a problem for someone to merely join in. Moreover, I think it is a perfect sandbox dungeon run game, where with the bits and the miniatures and a bit of houseruling, it is possible to build whichever dungeon adventure one wants. 
And even if you just play the game - I have never had this much fun dying. 

NOTE: I play with the combat dice version. ONLY with the combat dice version.

Echoing most criticisms of this game, it is just too random.  I think the view is nonsense that such decision-less, random mechanics are overcome by the supposed "narrative" they generate.  Let's try one:  Ishmael boards his spacecraft/motorcycle/sailing-ship and hunts Sasquatch/Tigger/Moby-Dick and he is killed/saved/shipwrecked.  That is one of the dumbest stories I've ever heard.   But that pretty much sums up DungeonQuest.  The one redeeming feature is that now I have some additional Heroes to use in RuneWars.

RATING: 9
One of my favourite board games. Completely underrated! Lots of fun as long as everyone's expectation are that: a.) The likelihood of their character dying during the game is high (even on the first turn!), b.) The probability of beating the game is low and c.) It's a game of risk and reward, not strategy and tactical thinking. The suspense of adding a new tile to the board, searching for treasure or exploring the catacombs is unlike most other games because you know the chance of death is so high. The card game for fighting monsters is a bit over-complicated and can kill the flow of gameplay a bit, but I did find that Fantasy Flight has official rules (on their site or somewhere) for simpler variations, allowing you to chose how complicated or simple you want this part of the game to be. 
Finally I can definitely recommend playing this game two-player with each player controlling two characters. This makes it a bit more forgiving because if one of your characters croaks at the start of the game, you can continue playing with hope for better luck for the other one. Or play on your own and have four characters!

A fine example of old-school game design that expresses the notion that it's fun to dole out punishment and reward in a purely arbitrary fashion. It enjoys a BGG score over 3 because of those who value notstalgia (and perhaps sado-massochism) as a substitute for actual gameplay. 

TLDR: It's rubbish.

RATING: 8.5
I really enjoy this game, but more importantly my wife really likes it.  I don't know what's so enjoyable about playing a game that kills you 9 out of 10 times (thus eliminating you from the game), but there is something just so enthralling about placing random tiles that can edge you closer to your goal, make you take a lengthy detour, or just eliminate you outright.  I am also really drawn into art style, which being a fantasy flight game, is quite superb.

Our primary complaint is, as many others have felt, that the combat system disrupts the flow of play and doesn't fit well with the rest of the game.  Still, after multiple plays, combat gets quicker and the disruption is minimized.

RATING: 7
A bizarrely unique game which is almost all luck, which often no one wins, and is still very amusing and fun.

The old DQ was a favorite, but frustrating with the inconsistent rules and constant referencing required. Surprisingly, FFG has actually improved this! The cards now have all the text right on them, and abilities are simpler and more consistent, yet quite possibly more useful!

The new combat system has resulted in too many decks of cards, but it actually plays well and is more exciting than the old one. Really, really too many decks of cards. The per-monster power cards are too much trouble for way too little gain.

Overall, I'm quite pleased with the new version. My one big gripe is that you still have to look what all the room tiles do. They have color coded arrows, but the colors are completely meaningless! This seems like a major fumble on making the game more playable. However, its still an improvement over the old DQ on all counts.

Ok, my second complaint is the combat cards. As above - too complicated! And escaping would have so much better as a die roll modifier on the monster card and hero card.

Although this is better than the original in a lot of ways (not having to constantly reference the rules for one), I like the original better.  The game can be horribly unfair and unbalanced (which is part of the fun!), and the original old and somewhat warped components fit the "feel" better in my weird opinion.  Also, I don't really like the new combat rules.  They seem to be needlessly complicated and can result in a whole bunch of wounds all at once, neither of which fits the game.  Still, I love the feeling of heading off on a very deadly adventure in which no one returning is a definite possibility!

RATING: 8
Tentative rating after initial solo play.  

I understand all of the fuss over the combat system.  The game is chugging right along at a quick clip, and then, bam!  A sorcerer pops up, and, ten minutes later, the game resumes.  The timing of it all is awful, the system is clunky, and it could've been lopped in half with a dice rolling system (which undoubtedly would have also been cursed).  

But, in a slight defense of the combat system, it does make for some pretty good narrative.  All of the combat cards are named, and looking at what happened during combat can be pretty entertaining.  

As for the rest of the game, it is a simple push your luck dungeon run (although combat slows it to a crawl).  This is a game played for the experience, on par with Tales of the Arabian Nights.  I can imagine tremendous stories come out of some games--heck I stumbled around in the catacombs with a crazy amount of gold and one wound left.  The sun was threatening to come up, and I was covered in blood--most of it my own from an ill-fated peep into the lair of Kalladra.  I fought off a huge spider, and a effeminate yet pesky sorcerer named Claude.  But then I fell victim to an aging vampire wearing a mesh half-shirt who went by the name Austin--one possible catacomb draw from a possible escape.  He sunk his teeth into my neck and all went dark.  Great stuff.

My first experience with DungeonQuest was not a good one. Basically, I entered the dungeon, and got killed. I was playing with two other players. One player had a similar experience. I think he lasted one ore turn than I. The third player got lucky and drew some gold in the first room he was in. After he saw that both of us were dead, he turned around and walked out of the dungeon for the win. In four turns, two players were dead, and one player left the dungeon after exploring only two rooms, and he won.

What. The. Eff.

Those were my thoughts. I boxed it up and swore off the game as a waste of money.

...Fast forward almost a year...

I decided to revisit DungeonQuest after reading and watching several reviews. A few of the reviews shared sentiments of my own. But I started noticing a lot of people coming to bat for the game and claiming that you have to go in expecting to be killed--in fact, the odds of the game are actually not in favor of the adventurers. As I thought about this, I realized that my terrible experience may have all been about my attitude and expectations as I approached the game. I really had no idea what an adventure game was all about at that point in my gaming career, and I definitely wasn't ready for the experience I had. 

I gave it another shot and went in with a totally different understanding for the theme and idea of the game. I must say, it made a difference and i quite enjoyed my last session.

I'm not going to rate the game a 10, or a 9, or even an 8 by any means. But I can appreciate what's there now. It's probably just not for me. After a long hiatus between my two plays, and a new understanding for the theme and challenges of this game, I'm rating it a 6.5. For the right crowd, looking for the right kind of gaming experience, I can see how this game would score higher points. But in the end, it's not for me. The next thing I'll do is give it a try with a group of people who may want to  just get killed by pressing their luck.

::UPDATE::

After playing it again, I saw my nephew have an enjoyable time because he was the only one who didn't die. I, on the other hand, died only a handful of turns in. I really hate this game. To me, there's no game when you just do a couple things and watch yourself die. Sure, everyone can laugh, but most my gaming friends don't laugh at that.

Final rating: 3.

I love this game for the hilarious stories of woe it creates (87% of the time). And for the other 13% of the time, it's such a strange feeling of accomplishment to actually make it out of the dungeon alive and to look at my friend's unbelieving faces as I wave my riches in front of their corpses.

This game isn't for people who want a serious thought out strategy or roleplaying experience. It's a good time with friends who don't take gaming too seriously (that doesn't mean that serious gamers won't find this game fun).

A final note:
I enjoy the battle card system. It's fast and adds a different level of excitement to the game that is a little less than pure chance. FF has made alternate dice rolling and old style rock paper scissors variations for those who just cannot stand the new cards.

Changed rating from a 4 to a 2 only for the extra characters you get for other Games in the Universe which is really the only reason to purchase this game. Quality is very high as usual for Fantasy Flight Games, but the game is completely broken as is. FF managed to update the components only. The game is broken out of the box, you can and will die faster than it takes to set the game up. Any game where you have a high chance of dying on the first turn is completely broken and untested. I'm surprised Fantasy Flight actually spent time and money to update and publish this and again in a revised edition (like most of there games that come out now) without bothering to fix core problems with the game.

I love this game. It's simple stupid fun. It's very random, though. But if you manage to win, you can pretend that you're good. If you lose, you can (rightfully) blame it on bad luck.

One drawback is the pretty long setup and tear down time for its game length. But we usually play several rounds, so it's not that big a deal.

I own the previous version from Games Workshop too. Is it worth the upgrade if you already own that version? Well, you have to ask yourself, do you want to play it again, but you never kinda get around to it? If so, go for it. You'll have a blast with this one. It's more streamlined and focused. And I like the new combat (even though my 10 year old son keeps killing me when I meet monsters...).

(And if you own Runewars, adding six more heroes, two of each alignment, doesn't hurt either.)

DungeonQuest is a re-imagining of the classic board game of dungeon exploration for 1-4 players. Set in the vibrant fantasy realm of Terrinoth (first popularized by Runebound), DungeonQuest retains the peril, tension, and brutality of the beloved original game while updating both mechanical and thematic elements. Players take on the roles of courageous (or foolish) heroes willing to brave the legendary dangers of Dragonfire Dungeon. Fortune awaits those able to venture into the dragon’s lair...

The new combat deck is a nice idea, but it takes way too long to use for a game that is meant to played quickly.  It only gives the illusion of choice, since it's still random and there's truly not much strategy involved.

Instead, I play with some of the combat dice variant's posted in the forums.  Rolling 2D6 for a battle and applying a character's special ability works simply and perfectly, and allows us to do what you are meant to in the game - die more quickly and have more time for another hopeless attempt :)

It's got tons of theme, and it seems to be close enough to the original,  but i'm not sure that's a good thing.  flip a random tile, resolve a random effect, which is usually a random card, and probably die.  your primary choice is "do i gamble for treasure and possible death, or no?", and the answer should usually be no.  The combat system is much more interesting than the rest of the game.

The usual stunning components from FF. Great premise- randomly generated competitive dungeon crawl. Then the combat happens.

"Were you enjoying that?" the game seems to ask. "Hard luck, because it's time to spend 8 turns playing a slightly less fun version of rock, paper, scissors..."

Boring, immersion-breaking and arbitrary. Just dismal.

I understand there are alternative combat rules available to download. To what extent these fix this glaring problem, I don't know. Not interested in playing again. Such a shame.

After 2 plays, I really, REALLY hate this game.  I usually LOVE dungeon crawl games, but this one is just not fun - at all - in the least - whatsoever!!! The quality of the game is great, FF holds up to their usual high quality component standard, but other than that, there is nothing good I can say about this game.  The turns take too long with 4 players, especially if there is combat involved.  The combat lets you use just ONE of your own characters fighting cards, same for the monster you are fighting, then you and the monster use the same boring generic cards to attack each other.  Not to mention, there is no variety to the monsters, I think there are 3 or 4 monsters in the game that you fight over and over - skeleton, demon, golem...that's all I ever saw.  And if you have the misfortune to roll bad on an attribute test, you die.  No going back to start, no choosing a new character, no "being knocked out" then being penalized - you are totally and completely dead and out of the game, other than to control the monsters for the player on your right when they have to fight - oooohhh exciting!!! NOT!!!!  Oh, and did I mention you could die as early into the game as your second turn?  Wow, what fun. As you go through the decks "adventuring", you will rarely EVER find something good or helpful or even remotely interesting.  Almost every card you draw is "empty" room or something bad happening to you, especially if you have the misfortune of ever willingly or accidentally going into the catacombs. There needs to be a balance of good stuff too, like something, ANYTHING to help your character raise attributes, equipment, healing items or more interesting treasure.  I did find a couple "unstable potions" which would heal me if I managed to roll an 8 or higher on 2 D6, otherwise I suffered more wounds, which killed me, or was just outright killed for rolling a 1 or 2.  This has to be one of the least fun, most annoying, boring games I have ever played.  I am glad this is my brother's game and not mine because I would be really ticked to have spent my money on this!!!

UPDATE: Sold/traded. If I want a push-your-luck game, Incan Gold is quicker to set up and play.

DungeonQuest is a funny, luck-based game where you die a lot. You get beheaded, fall down pits and so on. Not sure what you can compare it to, but probably a choose-your-own adventure story.

It's amusing to play alone or with friends.

Gameplay-wise, it's great. The most fun you can have while getting beheaded without warning. 

Unfortunately, it has so many bits that it takes ages to setup. And then you get beheaded on turn one... So you need to play about six games on the trot to make it worth getting out. And, by this time, you've played something else...

If it just had fewer cards, fewer tokens... Just tiles and a board, it'd be brilliant!

Game does not offer much in the way of strategy, and the combat rules SUCK. We use an alternate combat system, and enjoy the game for what it is: a silly game where you will most likely die.

This game is absolutely not for everyone. In one game, I almost died on the very first round by encountering a trap that read "Test armour or die". Fortunately, my hero (Hugo the Glorious!) had a high armour score and I came through. If you don't like this kind of random crazyness, you shouldn't play Dungeonquest. In my opinion, the combat rules are a bit too convoluted. My rating is based on a house rule that allows for the use of dice instead of cards in combat (this really speeds up the game):

This classic gets a facelift though there wasn't much wrong with the original other than it being OOP.  FFG does a good job on all areas except the combat mechanism where I still prefer the original rock-paper-scissors approach.

The best part of Dungeonquest is that it came with the hero cards for Runebound and Descent.  Its not a bad game, and I see the potential in it, but it just doesn't do it for me.

What makes this ridiculous game enjoyable is its short play time.  Ratings would plummet if it took twice as long to play.

And in the current version, at least, players who are knocked out still have something to do: they can run the battle rounds for the monsters during combat.

Plus there's always the post-elimination heckling:

[i]Player 1: I just pulled a bottomless pit tile. [rolls] Wait - I'm dead?

Player 2 (recently eliminated): I guess you shouldn't have pulled the bottomless pit tile. Idiot.[/i]

After a few short plays, I can also affirm that the card combat in DungeonQuest is neither complicated nor time-consuming. I can't see combat lasting more than 2-4 minutes, honestly, once you get used to the system. Just play quickly and live on the wild side.

My latest demise:  Killed on turn 1 by a swinging blade.  That'll teach me.

Don't take this game seriously. You will die most of the time, which makes surviving actually rewarding. Simple, smooth gameplay (combat only takes a few rounds to get used to, and there are even several variants now) and excellent components make me very happy to own this game. Multiple plays are encouraged since once it's out there isn't much more to setting it up (also gives the people who didn't make it past the first room a chance at redemption).

Will probably use the one-die variant for combat just to keep things rolling.

Sold.

Uhhh..yeah...played (not demo-ed) played full game, at gen Con. First let me start by saying I love Fantasy Flight games. This one not so much. Randomness of drawing your playing field=cool idea, but lack of direction, focus and absolutely no strategy required=bad. My turn starts with me going into the catacombs, sounds cool enough. No, the first card I draw is "torch blows out"(or something like that). What this means is until I roll under a 3 on 2D6 I pretty much lose a turn. Twice I got this card the second almost right after the first. Each time it took about 4 turns of the game to get under a 3 (only because after each failure I got basically a +1 counter to help the roll). Still 8 turns wasted doing NOTHING. The least they could do was have me encounter something while I sat in the dark, gimme a penalty or something, just let me fight! The rest of the time I found bodies with no treasure. Once I found my way to the Dragon, I was glad to draw cards until the dragon showed up just for something to happen and hoping he would waste me for sweet release so I could go to bed, but no...he only cooked me a little and before I could leave treasure room  we all died as night fell. Worst 4 hours of gaming I've ever had. Looks like this game needs one more edition to polish. Play Rune Wars.

@Elliot Eastoe, maybe you need to embrace this is a "game comment section" not "comment on people's opinions section". Or maybe embrace this game just isn't that good. Now I have to give it a 1 to counter your 10.

I was disappointed.  I knew the game was very deadly, random, and had little opportunity for strategy.  We all died fast in the first game.  The second game was longer, but I was surprised how boring the game became.  Fantasy Flight managed to come up with an even worse combat mechanism than Rune Wars.  It dragged out much longer than it needed to and did not add any additional theme.  The rooms and events became repetitive.  The monsters are rehashed from Runebound and Descent.  

Update - played with the dice variant and raised rating since combat now goes much faster.

Very good light hearted (but deadly) dungeon romp. Combat with cards is ok, altough it stops the tempo a little bit especially with new players. Variation to the combat with a dice makes the game shine (I might rise the rating after a couple more games with the dice).

With the right crowd this can be a blast. Single player it can be fun to beat scores, but not a lot of reason to keep replaying. It is heavily luck based, but as long as you go in knowing what to expect is enjoyable. Do not expect a lite-rpg here... there is no character progression, just items you may pick up that have a one time use for the most part. It plays fast, and has quite a few official variants that are fun.

Bias: I am a DungeonQuest nutcase.

This edition has very good components, unfortunately not as exciting as the original, especially if you include the original's first expansion. Main reason: The psycho(il)logical aspect of the original is gone. No more "choose a number on a d6. If you roll it, you die". The game doesn't give the player the illusion of control. Instead, most is slimmed down to trait rolls = not as fun.

The combat system in this version is interesting, but is too boggy. Drawing cards from a deck adds randomness to what in the original was rock-paper-scissors – another psychological aspect that FFG removed.

Terrinoth setting… sure. I don't care that much.

The art is great I guess… but it's just so mainstream today's fantasy-set games that it comes out bland. Sorry. Also, there's much too little variation on the art. All "empty" cards look the same. All "coins" card look the same. Not good.

The card distribution changes – less monsters, less empty, more crypts, more corpses make for an easier game while the tile distribution changes – more dead ends makes for harder to find your way around.

That said, I love this game since 25 years, but it has filed away the original's shining spots, thus I can't give it a 10. Pondering upon a 9 or an 8. The only reason for me to play this edition is for sheer variance purposes (just like 2e), as I play DQ quite fricking often. I find the revised edition me and a pal worked on for a year to be more exciting. The biggest reason for me to keep this edition is to be able to explore the expansions that FFG invariably will release.

I'm not overly fond of the mediocre Terrinoth [-]setting[/-] brand to begin with. For me, a re-theme was never going to capture the essence & feel of the original GW Edition. I much prefer the characters, creatures, and Gary Chalk artwork found in that release. Goblins, Trolls, Orcs and Skeletons conjure up a better dungeon theme than Razorwing, Ferrox & Naga.

I don't think the rules are as tight as those in the previous version either.

The bloated new style Combat is a disaster area which simply does not fit in with the base-game... Being nothing short of tedious, it is now a sub-game in itself. It is far slower & clunkier, and grinds the smooth flow of the game down to a crawl. The simplistic Rock/Paper/Scissors method used in the old version was all that was required for a game of this weight. Now we have a five minute overcomplicated slog-a-thon with every combat which ensues. This has changed the games focal point into a fight against monsters, rather than treasure collecting, which is what the game should be about.

Anyone possessing the original should really think hard on this... is it really worth forking over the extra cash for more of the same, but now with a bloated combat section?

With one or two slight additions from the new rulebook reverse engineered into Ye Olde GW edition, you should be able to have just as much, if not more, fun.

RATING: 7
A game that stretches your mind as you try to come up with clever ways to clue in your partner.  Some words are just too hard to get in one clue though (at least for me), meaning the game can sometimes bog down in deferring to the other team.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Classic, but not a favorite.  The amount of fun you have depends on your opponents & the word list.  The game will be good if the words aren't too easy or too hard... and if your partner is competent... and your team doesn't give clues that help your opponents too much.  This all adds up to being too much work for my game group.

Of all the word games I think I liked this one the best.  Maybe because it's word associations and not a letters game.  Although I do remember sometimes getting words that I didn't know, and having to ask Mom (or just skip it).  My vocabulary is still bad, so perhaps I didn't learn much from this game.

The old game show was perhaps more fun. A team who has seen Betty White play on the game show will have an advantage over those who haven't. The game is slower, quieter, and more thought-out than something like Taboo. I like the limitation of one-word clues, but I like the tense, hurried, loudness of Taboo. Decent, but overall I'd rather play Taboo.

[2 plays in recent years, many more back in the day] Good classic word game.  Can be delightfully maddening as you try to give clues that will help your partner but not the other team.  However, this game is NOT robust against playing with clueless people.  If someone doesn't have a decent vocabulary, you'll have a disaster on your hands.

Not a bad party type game.  Somewhat similar to Catch Phrase, but much slower?  Your team has to guess your word, but you only give one word as a clue at a time.  Also comparable to Taboo, without the Taboo words.

I passed on Password countless times in thrift stores. Then, a surprise bonus of some 60's era Password cards and sleeves turned up inside another game I bought. On the suggestion of someone in the personal comments, I threw them in the glove compartment of the car for a diversion on our next road trip. What good fortune! Because even with just me and the girlfriend playing freestyle, without opponents, we had a blast. Most astonishing moment was when I supplied the correct Password after hearing the single clue, "fall": "tumble". From now on, I will make it a point to smuggle a few cards from every Password game I come across.

It's hard to assign a rating for the game.  I can see why people could really get into Password.  I have a couple problems which are probably symptomatic of my lack of experience with the game.

The first problem is that many of the words are too easy - good partners will get the word on the first try.  The second problem is almost surely due to inexperience.  Because the words are not that hard, if you miss the first clue, you practically give away the answer to the opposing team.  I suppose that this is part of the strategy, to not give too much away to the other team, but why not try and go for the 10 points when you can?

Cute word game that I recall from my 1970's youth.  I think my family would still enjoy this game today but would probably enjoy Taboo as much if not more so it's not particulary worthwhile for me to hunt an old copy down.

I really enjoy this game, it's a great way to stretch your lateral-thinking muscles.  But most of our friends won't play with us because my husband and I share a brain, which gives us a decided advantage.  And if we split couples for the two teams, whoever gets the third clue usually wins that turn, so it's a bit predictable.

If there was ever a game that can range from awful to great depending on who you play with, this is it. I think this is an overloked classic. I also think it holds a record for the most reprints. I have a couple editions of this. The one thing I notice is that the words are NOT aimed at 10 and up (ardor was one of the words). I would say 15 and up. Also, get a 10 sided die and a dictionary and you can probably do okay without the magic-red readers.

It's okay, too often the team going second answers correctly--I guess therein lies the challenge when you give the first clue: Give an awesome clue that your partner will guess or be very vague and clean up with 3rd clue!

This game gave us one of television's all-time great comedy moments: Aristophanes.... ridiculous! ***UPDATE*** I got a chance to play this a bit at the 2004 GoF and forgot how much I enjoy the game. My partner, Matthew Frederick, and I reached the 3rd round of the Password tournament before we both decided to give clues in different languages, losing to the eventual overall winners. For those too young to get the reference above, it's from the Odd Couple - a beyond-classic episode from one of the greatest comedy series ever made.

A game that my childhood family used to play all the time.  I remember having a lot of fun either playing or watching the adults play.  I remember one game where the kids and the grannies were not invited to play - Just the adults.  Well the grannies just sat with themselves discussing the correct answers with each other; the adult were much to busy losing, I mean, playing the game to notice.  It was then that I learned never to discount the grannies!

Fun, provided that teams are comparable and that partners are on similar wavelengths as to clues. The match doesn't have to be perfect, though, because the bonus questions allow for comebacks at the end and an occasional bungled clue is funny.
Codenames has superseded this for me; among other virtues, it fails more gracefully.

Password is a bit of a timeless classic. It is easy to play, takes very few props, and offers plenty of challenge and competition. One of the best times I had playing was while waiting in line to see a show. It passed the 40 minutes very well!
All you need is a few people. Never pass over a copy if you see one available. I feel there will always be a moment for Password.

This is a very nifty word association game... but I often get turned off from it due to the lack of a time limit to come up with a clue (unlike the TV shows). When you're sitting around for 5 minutes waiting for a single clue, it's pretty frustrating. It's excellent with quick players though!

RATING: 4
After 5+ Plays: These sort of party games, in which you are trying to get other people to guess a word/phrase, work better with larger groups.  When you only have one person guessing it is too easy to get frustrated and annoyed at your partner.  Another big problem is that so many words can be figured out with 2 good clues, but not with one.  So, if you give a good clue but your partner misses it, you are practically handing the points to the other team.  Once the players realize this the game can really drag as it becomes at least as much about not setting up the other team as about actually winning the word.

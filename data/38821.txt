RATING: 7
Great intro to the series, but had to chop up the pre-configured tiles and make some custom number chips to get any amount of replay out of it.  Fun for the kids in pre-configured form because it's fairly balanced, but they quickly grew out of that.  We still play frequently, but will need to pick up the full-size game so we can use any of the expansions.

Settlers is a great game but it has a little to much luck and the first player always has a target on his/her back.  Nothing like loosing to a player who builds roads and development cards with 3's and 11's all game and wins because he wasn't blocked the entire game.

RATING: 8
I bought this due to the Catan name. It wasn't the version I had expected, but even though it is a "simplified" version, it does the trick for a mostly casual gamer.

Standalone and independent to its other versions, this game is still top notch and worthy of my 8 score.

Played with a nongamer and they had difficulty with development cards (and confidence towards strategy, but that's presumably through a lack of experience). But after asking me for help about what they did, all I did was simply read the card and they understood.

1 argument occurred though and the printed rules weren't clear. The internet FAQ cleared it up though. Essentially, Settlements do block the construction of roads - the argument was that settlements and roads weren't on the same plane and thus didn't block each other.

After playing games like Ascension, I was a little disappointed by the lack in variability of development cards. But that finite number is also a part of the strategy, so it's a dirty wash.

I've moved on from Catan, although I will still play it! It holds fond memories as my first euro, but others are doing it better I feel. But it makes me happy when someone talks to me and says they discovered a "new board game" and it's catan! It's still making an impact in the world of Board-gaming, and for that, I am eternally grateful!

Accidentally picked this up on my way out of town, in a hurry to introduce a few friends to a few games.  "Gallery Edition" it sounded fancy!  Oops.

It was adequate for teaching the new Settlers how to play. They were hooked, but unfortunately now we've got a non-expandable, fixed board at our disposal.

Esse jogo é uma excelente maneira de introduzir novos jogadores brasileiros ao mundo do jogos modernos. Ele é rápido, cada partida dura em média 50 minutos. As regras são fáceis de explicar (10 minutos). A jogabilidade é fantástica pois permite uma série de possibilidades e o peso dos dados (sorte) é pequeno em comparação aos jogos tradicionais do Brasil. Na realidade a sorte no CATAN "é para todos" já que o valor dos dados pode prejudicar ou beneficiar vários jogadores ao mesmo tempo. Outro fator importantíssimo é que todos os jogadores sempre crescem, uns mais que outros, mas sempre crescem. O tabuleiro formado de peças hexagonais, fato novo para o brasileiro, o que gera sempre um jogo diferente do outro devido a disponibilidade e organização dos recursos. Recomendo. Esta versão especial as Mayfair possui peças plásticas, marcador de pontos, moldura para o tabuleiro e conjuntos de hexágonos que facilitam a montagem do tabuleiro. Excelente para jogadores que estão conhecendo os jogos modernos.

Bought this kinda by accident. Went into LGS to get Catan and came out with this. Didn't know there were multiple versions of the base game.  So for not paying attention I get the crippled version. Still better than no version at all. Next time we might even get all of the rules right.

Not sure why this ranks 5.6 and the regular version ranks 7.4. It is the same game with the set-up made easier. Setting up being easier does cost some flexability with the game, but that shouldn't cause that big a desparity.

Can't help thinking the very low score for this version is based on other versions, rather than anything else, which I guess is fair enough. for me, I found this version for less than £10 and it scratches the Catan itch, which suits me fine.

You know what I don't like about american comic books; it's just the same nonsense over and over again.  If you want to recapture a moment from you childhood then go invent a friggin' time machine.  If you stop buying it they will innovate...oh, and the Catan thing was just like you'd expect.   -H7

This was my intro into good board games. When compared to the classic monopoly or sorry then it's a 10 all the way, but once you start playing other games the overall rating lowers some.

I consider Settlers of Catan, the gateway drug into a better world of gaming. It's the best of the Walmart offerings and opens you up to a better world of gaming. I appreciate Settlers for what it is and still keep it around and play it with people that are casual gamers because it's not too hardcore or hard to learn...and odds are people have heard of it and are willing to play

The classic trading game. I don't mind this budget edition, it makes setup quicker, and I find the graphic design clearer, plus the square board looks nice. 

Preferred variants:
1. Tournament Start - place a settlement and road (in turn order), then a city and road (in reverse turn order), then a third road (in turn order). Still only get 1 initial resource for each hex around the city.
2. Reroll 7s on everyone's first turn.
3. Welfare Variant - if you didn't get a resource from a non-7 roll get a welfare token instead. These can be spent on your turn at a rate of N for any resource, where N is your number of visible points.

To me, Catan always feels like half of a game. You spend a lot of time trying to start building up only for the game to end just as you finally feel like you've finally begun to start accomplishing something. However, just making the game longer wouldn't really fix that.

Settlers more or less as it was in the beginning. The attraction here is the lower price point to get it down to gift giving price range. It does the job, and if you end up turning a few people into Settlers fans then you can point them in the direction of the many stand alone variants available. (Catan Geographies: Germany and Settlers of America: Trails to Rails being my two favourites.)

Nice game for young kids.  They can set up the game themselves since the hexes are in blocks of 2, 3 and 4.  The resource numbers are fixed making the game more balanced.

Thrift find. Not as much variability as the original, but enough for most folks, and the setup time is greatly reduced. Gameplay isn't changed at all. The square board is cool and the trade info is printed right on it, reducing the need for one of the player aids. This is the copy I will bring on vacations and to play at family gatherings. I wouldn't have paid full price for it and if I had to choose between this and the original, I pick the latter. But for a thrift store find it's just about perfect.

RATING: 8.5
A modern classic, everyone and their cat has played this. A lot of hate gets piled onto this for two main reasons. First, the die can screw you out of resources. Now, the more experienced player almost always seems to win by a decent margin so this would indicate that luck doesn't actually have as much sway on the conclusion of the game as it might appear to, but you can still have quite a few dead turns just because the dice didn't want you to do anything. Second, starting placement is everything. A new player that makes a mistake during set-up is probably going to lose. Not just lose, they're going to get completely destroyed. That probably sours a lot of people to the game and you really need the teacher to stress the importance of a strong starting position (and maybe even make suggestions for the first game or two). 

Those two "flaws" aren't really flaws of course, but they have kept a lot of people away from this one. It's definitely worthy of the hype however.

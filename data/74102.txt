GAME: Der Pate
RANK: 4256

RATING: 6.75
Der Pate (The Godfather) is a licensed product from Paramount Pictures. The game mixes an area control and multiple-use dice mechanic to create some interesting choices in a relatively short (60-75 minutes) playing time for four players. An interesting play, with the predictable player interaction (sending opponent family members to prison or into the Hudson to "sleep with the fishes"). The family with the most money wins.

Eigentlich ein sehr nettes Familien und Strategiespiel, aber ich finde die Symbolik auf dem Aktionstablett nicht sehr eingängig und zu klein, so dass man immer wieder drüber nachdenken muss, was man eigentlich tun kann. Das ganze dauert schon ein paar Spielchen, bis man es wohl im Kopf hat und dann auch entsprechend taktisch fahren kann. Deshalb nur eine 7.

What a fun game!  Lots of interaction and screwage.  The dice tableu mechanic was a great idea.  To get the things done you need done proper managment of your dice and favor chits is critical.  Downside is that the game really needs 4 to shine and it's only available in Germany.

The main problem is the down time. For 75% of the time, you're watching somebody else roll dice, while there is nothing you can do in the meantime.

Otherwise, the theme is fun. The dice management is fun. The luck factor is quite okay.

First impression: Good example for a "game by a film", nice and rich graphics and a lot of "flair". Nonetheless, the iconolgy could be clearer and some player handouts would help, too. Gameplay is easy, but interesting. But you have to keep up with a lot of "take that" moments!

After years I have finally gotten this to the table. Why it took so long is beyond me because it truly is a great, great game. The mechanics aren't that tough, the theme and setting is there, the interaction is there and the playtime is there. This needs to be more of a permanent fixture in my game bag and really is deserving of a wider release, but sadly the license is what prevents that and I think dropping The Godfather and just making it about NYC mobsters wouldn't cause the game to lose much.

Der Pate perches somewhat precariously on the small ledge between family and gamers' games territories. In complexity it clearly leans towards the family games, but some of the graphic design and especially the ubiquitous direct conflict pull it strongly in the other direction, even though they are undubitably very thematic.

The central dice allocation mechanism is great, and I hope we'll something like it in other works, but the action choices in this game just leave a lot to be desired. Oftentimes there is nothing you can do with a dice result, and at most other times there is only a very small number of helpful actions. Consequently, the dice often play you rather than the other way around.

A fun and inventive dice game for adults loving mafia-themed movies. In spite of a massive dice usage there is some room for planning and tactics. The graphics is beautiful and adds a lot to the theme of the game.

Maybe it's not the most challenging game in my collection but it's fun and engaging. Worth trying.

The dice mechanism looks great on paper, and indeed it offers sometimes interesting little dilemmas. But still, the game doesn’t give that many interesting choices, suffers from downtime, and really lacks fun.

This game looks really good, but involves too much luck for a game of its length. I found it strange that you have to re-roll your dice in every step. This makes finding a decision even easier and more random.
Some of the player actions have a big impact on the other players (killing guys), but are not harder to trigger then any of the other actions and there is no way to protect yourself from them.

RATING: 7
Der Pate is neither a strategy nor a family game which might be part of the problem why it is ranked so low on BGG. The other part is the lack of a US release due to copyright issues I guess. It's a pity because Der Pate is a fun short and thematic game clocking in below an hour. It's dice-driven and mainly tactical in deciding on the optimal allocation of the dice. It is also confrontational and has a medium luck factor which balances the game as confrontation will usually be directed at the player who had the most luck so far. Not sure about the replayability as there's not much depth here but it's intended for the occasional gamer anyway.

I love the theme and the dice mechanism, but the rest needs something more. The biggest issue is the downtime problem: first one player makes his moves, then it's next players turn (and between turns the situations chances all the way) and before it's your turn it has take some time - and that time is too long. I really wanted to like Der Pate more.

RATING: 6
Not a game for the faint of spirit...;-)

LIKES:

* This game sticks very true to its theme of mafia wars between families.  Ouch!
* Uses an interesting dice mechanic where both color of the die and number of pips may come into play.  There are four actions you will take on your turn and four different color dice so whichever color die you choose to take for income, you won't be able to take any white actions in the other three action rows.  You re-roll your dice after choosing a die for income and after choosing the next row, but then you split the final two dice between the last two rows.
* The first action of income can effect other players much like Settlers allowing other players to potentially gain income on your turn.  
* The event card mechanic which moves the car around AND eventually determines whether influence or reputation is the key factor (whichever color reaches 4 cards first becomes the first YOU LOSE condition if you don't fill out that color line) is fairly entertaining.  
* Car generally means all businesses in that district are safe from raids and takeovers.  
* Grudge tokens are a nice touch!  If you takeover a business from someone else, killing one of their gangsters in the process, you give that opponent one of your grudge tokens which is something they can cash in later and force you to pay them between $1-5 dollars if they choose said option.

DISLIKES:

* Appears the start player starts each round for all 7 rounds.  If people aren't aware that this means they need to pick on the last player or two, this allows for a massive last player advantage.  Perhaps we played incorrectly?  
* Game is only in German - probably due to copyright laws?  Still, there are English aids that assist greatly and the game is largely language independent once you learn the symbols/actions.  
* There is a fair bit of downtime but it feels manageable for the most part.  After all, there isn't that much to think about (just have to figure between 3-4 choices at much).

Bei diesem Spiel geht es ums Geld. Wer am Ende das meisste hat gewinnt. Aber wer aufs falsche Pferd setzt (Ansehen oder Ruhm) kann vor der Endwertung aus dem Spiel fliegen, denn erst während dem Spiel wird klar, welches der beiden Werte denn wichtig ist und ausgebaut werden sollte.
Wärend seines Zuges würfelt jeder Spieler 4 Würfel, setzt einen ein und erhält entsprechen und eventuell Geld ausgezahlt, dann würfelt er die restlichen 3 und nutzt eine Aktion eines entsprechenden Farbwürfels, das machte er nochmal für Zug 3 und 4. Während dieser Zeit können die anderen Spieler leider nur zuschauen und nichtmal vorausplanen, da sie ihre Würfelergebnisse nicht kennen.
Den Mechanismus finde ich super, allerdings wäre es toll wenn alle Spieler gleichzeitig je 4 Würfel werfen, dann Reihum Zug 1 gemacht wird -> Zug 2 -> etc.
Für ein Familienspiel finde ich die Mechanik okay. Beim Thema wird es schwer es mit Kindern zu spielen, da es um Mord und Totschlag geht (Basiert auf dem Film "Der Pate").

Rieneck's games are becoming increasingly more suited to my tastes; after the disappointment of Cuba and the rather shallow joys of Pillars of the Earth, World Without End was the first of his works that I did not only want to play more than once or twice, but where my enjoyment improved from game to game.

I’ve only played Der Pate once so far, but if further plays are as enjoyable, this one might even make my to-buy list - not a small feat right after Essen, when my and everybody else’s stack of unplayed purchases tends to by higher than anytime else. The resourcivitis that plagued Cuba and hampered the two Follett-based games is toned down, and the remaining resources are better integrated with each other. The usual mini-game that determines your possible actions is the neatest so far, with a delightful mix of planning and luck. And thematically, it’s top notch - both regarding the illustrations and the implementation into the game’s mechanics.

The only caveat to my endorsement is that I’ve won the only game I’ve played so far, which does admittedly tend to lend a nice rosy tone to my glasses, but I’m hoping for repeated plays (and wins) to validate my trust in the qualities of Der Pate.

The dice placement on your turn is fun and offers some interesting choices. That system would offer a starting point for a great game, but unfortunately in Der Pate you just end up repeating the process seven times. Nothing really builds up and despite how you can mess with opponents you really don't feel player interaction. Der Pate is still an Ok game.

This is a really bad game, bordering on broken. It is way to easy and random to lose meeples from the board and way to difficult to get them back on, so games tend to end with only 1-3 meeples overall left standing and a random winner.

Strategy game with very nice theme. Although it is a dice game the factor of luck is very small because after every cast of dice you can choose different actions and there a lot of good actions you can use. This make it more tactical than luck based.

A 5-6 player expansion would be very great for the future.

Played this once right after Essen 2010 and will most likely never play it again. For me it was the biggest dissapointment of 2010. Great graphics, nice theme. I really wanted to like this game. But then again: The mechanics are pure luck, there is just no planning possible, not to mention any tactics. It just left a poor feeling. Not that I lost the game: Everybody on the table, even the one who ownes and knew the game lost any enthusiasm during playtime. Got better things (and games) to spend my time.

First of all, just not very exciting to play in my opinion. There are hundreds of games I would play before this one. The mechanics etc work but are just not inspiring. The theme is what will sell this game to most people, but delivery is a whole other ballgame.

Any game that disqualifies you from the ability to win I have a problem with, unless you not meeting the conditions is tottaly your fault. In my first and only game I did not have a shop that advanced either marker. In the beginning others moved on teh red track at least 3 times just by benefitting from other players moves (first play so I will let that slide and know the imporant of the #1 shops next time). However in the last 3 turns I did everything I could to advance red but got screwed by the dice, even when re-rolling. So I got disqualifed because I couldn't roll a number I needed. Maybe if I played every red and grey from the beginning things would have been different. However, IF I have to do that I might as well follow a script and then why am I playing again? Poor design and won't see me again!

nice use of dice and allowed action, but a lot of downtime as you cannot act in any way during your opponents turns.

the using of the dice board could be tactic - in another game.
it feigns tactics (different ways of development, different use of the dice), but it is nearly pure arbitrariness.

It seemed interesting at first, and in the course of the game I saw some tactics which I would have liked to have tried out if I'd seen them earlier, but frankly after just 30 mins it had overstayed it's welcome: you had nothing to do or think about while the other players were rolling their dice, and by the end of the game there was often little to do to advance your position (i.e., there were fewer game choices at the end of the game than the beginning, which just doesn't seem right).

I like games in which players manage dice rolls in order to achieve some kind of strategy, like [i][url=http://www.juegosdemesacr.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=51&Itemid=1]To Court the King[/url][/i], [i]Roll Through the Ages: The Bronze Age[/i] or [i]Roma[/i]. I like them even more when the dice are used to allow players to perform different actions, like [i][url=http://www.juegosdemesacr.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=159&Itemid=1]Conan: The Boardgame[/url][/i] and [i][url=http://www.juegosdemesacr.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=79&Itemid=1]Kingsburg[/url][/i]. Nevertheless, [i]Der Pate[/i] stays one step behind, cause the players don't really have to many choices to choose from, and have even less options to achieve some control of the rolls. Besides, some features, like the [i]Friends of the Family[/i], don't play a real part in the game. So, the game offers you control and ways to build a strategy, but at the end it doesn't deliver too much of that. Besides, the Corleone's screen legal bussiness was an olive oil importer one, not a jazz club, that doesn´t fit with Vito's personality. Even so, it is not a bad family game and deserves an opportunity from time to time.

RATING: 7
the imperative of the dice must not underestimate the possibility of making hard choices (I need the red die, but the only one with which I collect money from my activities ...).

The game also adapts perfectly to the style of the players, ranging experience accordingly: the prevalence of computers that think clearly "you win more wars thinking" will prove a game situation perpetually tense, with the prison cells filled gangster, while those for the gratuitous violence will not hesitate to dye the red river of the city to the sound of the dead.

But let's talk about defects: one for all, the tracks of progress, the idea of ​​paths reputation and influence, to be developed under penalty of death, is very nice but is a bit 'end in itself, in the sense that the players can not hinder in any way in to advance.

The two optional routes, the income of the family and the favors of the family, are unbalanced in favor of the annuity. Both can only move forward using the appropriate option in the last row of white and actions, provided that it is worked each round, one of the two will be maximized as soon as the fourth round of play.

However, while the benefits of the annuity are immediate (money), favors the family can only be activated by spending tokens special "family friend", also unlockable paying with a special option, always white. As you will understand, therefore, make the most of the favors is very expensive in terms of time, it should also be said, however, that at least the first level of favors is important if you have exaggerated the massacres during the match, allowing you to recover gangster dead, and the second level can be interesting to remove annoying debts with other families without spending money, but do not recommend to advance further.

The last defect lies in the setting: pull the money, it's a german game with dice and although everything is designed to reproduce the atmosphere of the Godfather, this feels little.

In conclusion I would say a 7 full.

Nice dice game with a darker theme.
Not sure if it's a "familygame for everybody". (Surely it's a '"family"-game for every body')
What concerns me most is that in other players turns there is nothing I can do (except for trash-talking). The game has a lot of player-to-player conflict, but to me it seems so one-way.

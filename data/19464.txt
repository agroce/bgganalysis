This is a very interesting strategy game where you have to get your opponent out of position to get the opportunity to score.  It is almost like a wargame... move and shoot, move and shoot.

RATING: 3.5
Roll the die, move your player, roll again to kick the ball. Other player does the same thing, roll to kick the ball if he manage to get to it. 

A few incidents occur whereby players are all around but the die roll does not allow you to reach the ball. Making the situation look funny. 

Need some house rules to smoothen it out. 

Very tired after the game rolling tremendous amount of dice to have only a few shots at the goal. 

Stopped the game after an hour worth of rolling dice and unreachable goals.

I love this game.  Current = 7 could raise to an 8 after some real plays.  My current rating based on playing a full game, me versus me, with me actually playing hard against myself as if I was a real player.  Excited to get someone to play this fully.

Downgraded because it is such a dicefest.  I want to play against a real grown up (Played a couple of times against my young son) and see if there are as many tactics as I believe there to be.

The outcome of certain plays is certainly dependent on the luck of the dice, but strangely enough, the game as a whole does not feel particularly luck-driven. You can make clever tactical plays with your player placement that lead directly to goal-scoring opportunities. Definitely recommended for fans of the beautiful game.

A geek made an unauthorized English Premier League edition of this game and offered it on bgg for a free download. When we reacted to this we were unfairly treated and hence some negative comments about our 'shenanigans' and false 1 ratings. The person who did this sits in the '7' ratings and makes an untrue statement about how we treat our customers. He moved his rating higher to try and get noticed, as he had a much lower 'rating' before. At the time of this fiasco STW had an 8 rating. This game is highly rated everywhere else, and excellent sales. 

Pay no attention to the fake negative ratings far below. These come from a certain negative segment of bgg.

This bad behaviour is actually encouraged at bgg.

Thank you for your understading.

Since some people have chosen to use this game's ratings to protest an action by the publisher that they likely do not have the full story about, I am going to protest their actions by giving this a ten. Ratings should be about the game only, but this game's rating is now ruined for non-game reasons. I have not played this game, but I seem to remember before all the attack ratings this was rated as high as 7.9 at one time. So it's likely I would give it a high rating anyway.

Confusing rules. 

Doesn't clearly state what item you are using to do each step of play - normal dice or green dice? Spinner or dice? etc.

Yes, there's a lot of dice rolling, but that's better than just having a little :-)  Can get a bit tiresome, but the game rewards positional play.  I think I'd rather play StreetSoccer myself, but the kids prefer this one due to the chrome.

A very fun soccer game, possibly better than [gameid=3421]. Lots of dice rolling, but you make decisions about moving players and the ball, and positional play is important.  Does a good job in recreating the feel of a soccer game - the closest thing to soccer without it being a dexterity game or the real thing.  Very fun and good for families and soccer fans.  Inexpensive too. Highly recommended is the goal shooting chart variant, discussed in my article [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/677332/]here[/url].

Two notes on my rating. First, I'm rating the game, not the publisher (and I'm largely ignorant of the issues with the publisher). Second, I am rating the game for what it is trying to be—a quick-playing game with interesting decisions but not a ton of depth. This isn't Brass or even Agricola, but it is a surprisingly interesting game that is evocative of an actual match. While not a simulation, it's possible to see many general principles of the game at work, and I found myself faced with many more interesting decisions than I expected from such a dice-heavy game. Really a surprisingly fun game.

RATING: 8
This is fundamentally a really great game (far superior to Street Soccer).  The overall rating for this game is suffering from a backlash against a poor decision by the publishers (which may have since been reversed) to limit content about its game on BGG.  Just check out the many non-game related 1 ratings to see what I mean.  As you will see below, this is not the only way that the game publisher has managed to shoot themselves in the foot.  Which is a shame, because this is a good game.

There are some really questionable design decisions in the components.  For example, why use "sorry pawns" for the defending payers?  All of the offense players and the goalies have somewhat anthropomorphic figures.  The score dials are cool, but once installed (and they are permanent) the boards no longer lay flat when folded in the box.  This leads to warped boards.  That is just lame. The timer included with the game is next to useless.  I would pay extra for a truly functional timer.   The worst feature is the spinner for shooting on goal, which must be installed each game in the MIDDLE OF THE BOARD.  Who though of that idea?  The spinner is not completely random (because the board does not lay exactly flat -thanks to the score wheels causing the board to warp) so the spinner touches in some places.  Worse, if you have players on the field where the spinner is, you have to move them to be able to use the spinner.

A die is included in case you don’t want to use the spinner, which would be cool BUT, the spinner has 8 spaces, but the die included is a six sided die, and the relative probabilities for some outcomes differ between the spinner and the die.  Why in the world did they not use an 8 sided die?   The game is good enough that I would buy it again if I lost my copy, but I really hope that if there is ever a second edition the publisher will re-think some of the components.

A fairly poor simulation of football. My friends got frustrated that they had no control over where the ball was going: nothing sucks more than being constantly forced to pass the ball backwards because you keep rolling high numbers. The thinking aspect also bogs down the game quite a bit which detracts from the excitement.

Most importantly, the rule that only the offensive player has initiative means that the game is pretty boring for the defensive player. All he can do is sit and wait and not move any pieces. Overall a disappointing game.

Minor gripe about the goal scoring mechanism in the center of the board. WTF? Having to remove players and remember their positions so that you can score a goal is just plain stupid.

A lot of roll and move here.  Simple, somewhat fun, a bit more complicated than street soccer.  Enjoyable with the right opponent.

Additional plays leave me solidly enjoying this game.  It is a nice tactical game that often leaves you making a risky choice for a big payoff.  There is a bit of planning and a bit of tension.  Is it the game of the year?  No.  Are the designers a little wacky?  Yes.  Does that mean this game is a 1?  NO!

Disregard the naysayers.  This game has flaws for sure, but it has got it's enjoyable parts too.  The dice for me capture the tension and uncertainty of a real soccer game - don't use the spinner, it's a pain.  The (variant) d6 works well in my opinion.

Try it if you are uncertain, but do not rule this out just because of the unfair negative comments against it.

This game really does feel like soccer and with the minimum of rules. It's fairly random but there's still some strategy to how to place your pawns and some general odds estimation.

The rules aren't totally terrible but the player aid certainly serves to crystallize your understanding. I know this company had a bad reputation for bad behavior in the past but denying yourself the experience for that reason is a disservice to your gaming ID.

roll and move soccer game.  I found it fun, and would like to play some more matches to try a few things out.

Pluses:
+ quick playing
+ easy rules
+ at first blush seems good tactics should win

Minuses:
- lots of die rolling
- central spinner is poor choice (use special die instead)
- players and teams are too generic

I think this is probably best approached with short times for each half, and consider it capturing the ebb and flow of a soccer match, and not a simulation of each play.

I rate this game low because it is a frustrating game for someone who appreciates football.

Was a bit disappointed in this, as it borrows ideas from several soccer games, yet on the whole doesn't seem to capture the flow of the game. Instead it feels like too much back-and-forth dice rolling, with too little variation in what happens. Sold, November 2010.

RATING: 5
A dice driven affair that attempts to simulate a full 90 minute match. And yes, you're actually meant to play for 90 minutes with the given timer - we play first goal wins. In practice, it's roll a die, move a guy, roll a die, pass the ball. If it gets to another of your players, you can pass again. If you've got the ball, the defender rolls a die, and if he can land on your ball space, then each roll a die and whoever rolls highest gets the ball and starts afresh. If the balls in a vacant space, whoever gets there first starts afresh. As you can see, that's a lot of die rolling for 90 minutes. The only cleverness is in setting up your men so that as many die rolls as possible can be successful, but it can all get undone pretty quickly with some weird die results. It adds a bunch of rules to simulate fouls, corners and so on, seeking a simulation feel. But football just isn't this random unfortunately so it doesn't capture the feel at all. Scoring a goal is another die roll result. Morsel's Street Soccer packs all the oomph of the "setup your men so as to maximise results" feel of a soccer game in a much tighter and more enjoyable game, meaning this one is unfortunately going to languish. For a game of this length, I'd be expecting player or team differentiation of some sort to give us something more to think about than just placement to cope with randomness.

RATING: 7
I don't accept the company's methods either but that won't affect to my opinion about this game. It's a VERY luck-dependent game but the rules make sense and feel logical.
There are no subtle ways to make goals, the only way is to get a pass onto the star-marked areas or onto the white-bordered area. It's difficult but possible.

The possible routes are really difficult to see. I had trouble with them for a long time. Only after 45 minutes of playing I began to see them a bit better.
After that, the game could be played faster - which is the essence of this game. You really should play quick and stop calculating any probabilities, it will only ruin the experience. Fast play is fun play in this game.

Football simulated in a fun way!

That game kicks ass. A good attack and defense game mainly based on luck. The material is O.K. The rule book is playsantly made but lack of in play exemples that would greatly help solve grey area in the rules. This is realy a fun game for the whole family. But for fan of brainburning games, this is not for you.

Soccer Tactics est un bon jeu d'attaque et de défense basé sur la chance. Le matériel est O.K. Le livre de règlements est bien présenté mais il manque des simulations de parties afin de résoudre certaines zones grises dans les règlements. C'est un jeu très plaisant pour toute la famille. Mais pour les fans des jeux casse tête, ce jeu n'est pas pour vous.

A lot of dice rolling and spinner spinning leads to a basically random game. The world cup theme is pretty thin here considering that all of the players are identical. Compare with something like Blood Bowl where players have positions, strengths, weaknesses etc and the dice merely provide the necessary friction. I can cope with a ton of randomness in a quick filler, but for an hour and a half it's just too much.

In my opinion, Streetsoccer does the same thing much better, in a more manageable timeframe, for half the price and thrice the fun. But neither game really fills the soccer simulation niche, and in the end we need a game that's more along the lines of a contemporary Blood Bowl.

It is too bad this company has such little respect for its consumers.  I would have bought this game had they not enforced such draconian measures over reviews here.

First off, the best sports game I've played, hands down.  To do soccer without dexterity and succeed is a success indeed.  The game is fun, intuitive, easy to learn, and my son and I have had a BLAST with it.  I am 0-2 so far, and enjoying it all the same.

I'm not really into soccer, so I don't think I'll end up giving this game a fair shake.  I received it as a sweetener in a trade, looking to flip it or gift it sometime in the future.

I don't like a game where everything is about getting the right die roll.
It could be fun to kids.

They have it in a shop I know For Sale. I tought to buy it but with this behavior from this company they do not get a penny from me even if they might have brought out the "Spiel des Jahres"

[BGCOLOR=#FF0000] Publisher requested content be removed from BGG? Bad practice to take, in my opinion. I'll not be playing this game, despite it's previous positive comments, nor will I buy any of their games. [/BGCOLOR]

Great fast paced 2 player game. Does not require to know soccer as it is more a chess-like game however it has the same rules as soccer.

Entertaining, but I still prefer Subbuteo for the real soccer feeling.

Very good little soccer game completely ruined by the publisher/designers childish attitude towards its customers. 

I will never buy another Stein-Thompson game.

Fast moving, fun, captures the spirit of footie reasonably well. Shame you have to move the men off the board to use the spinner, shame about some of the flag mix ups (Union Jack WTF!).

I disagree with the publishers idiocy regarding the geek but I'm not about to throw a bogus rating in to show my displeasure.

Soccer Tactics WORLD combines the strategy of soccer with the heart of the game. Eleven players per team on a traditional full-length field. This game includes dribbling, passing and capturing the ball; and intense battles for ball control.

Awesome. Simple mechanics yet significant strategy. Not a simulation of "real" football perhaps, but an enjoyable game, nonetheless.

Football is War! (Rinus Michels)

Won this game in a contest at BGG and I'm really delighted to have it.

[i]EDIT: unfortunately my friends don't like football, not even as boardgame. So it remains unplayed. [/i]

[i]EDIT 2: Managed to play 3x, but it wasn't very fun because it takes too long. In fact it's as slow as a real match of modern football. Yup, that's pretty boring nowadays. Gave it away. [/i]

I've never played this game, and based on the childish and hostile actions of Stein-Thompson Games, I hope to never give their company a penny of my money, nor any of their games my support by playing (or owning them) in any incarnation. Who knows though? it might be a decent game.

I tried the game at Essen.  It's OK and there's nothing broken about it.  But for soccer games of a similar nature I'd rather play Street Soccer which is easier and quicker, or Soccer Chess which is slightly more involved and IMO more tactical.  I'm not a spinner fan either but the game can be played with dice as well.

The publishers decision to pull their content of Soccer Tactic WORLD" from BGG was IMO a very poor one.  Too bad as the designer seemed to be a very nice person and passionate about the game when I met him in Essen (in 2005).

Αν για οτιδήποτε κάνεις πρέπει να ρίχνεις ζάρι αυτό σημαίνει ότι το παιχνίδι έχει πάρα πολύ τύχη ακόμα και με τους variants.

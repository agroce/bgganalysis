Quick and simple football game that often produces realistic scores. It really seems to need expansion teams to be fun to play. There is nothing wrong with the base game by itself, but it can feel boring at times because both players have to use the same cards and the same dice.

I'm not a big fan of football, but I have some family who are.  I like this game, and more importantly, my football loving family likes it too.  It runs a little long for what it is at about an hour and a half.  The game is all about guessing what your opponent is going to go for.

RATING: 6
Fun football game. It captures the bluffing aspect that I like from Madden - is your opponent going to pass or run? What's the best defense for that? When do you bluff and throw a bomb? Having so many dice is a bit unwieldy, but that's okay.

I found this game to be interesting, and an excellent transfer of football to board game format.  It was only played a couple times though, and because it is a two player game, it was unlikely to see much further play.

Only played once so far (base game only), but I had fun. My opponent, the esteemed Mario Cortez, thought it overstayed it's welcome. I *guess* I can see that, when you're getting crushed the way he was by my awesome Spartan Slayers. In all honesty, I can see some flaws here and tweaks could be made. I do want to give it a try with the expansion teams. Stickers on the dice deserves the biggest thumbs down ever though.

Just a game of non-deterministic RPS. Would be SO much better if you had a chance to react to what the offense/defense was showing on a given play. Audibles, stunts, etc. As is, you blind guess and then roll a bunch of dice.

Great football game. Simple interactions (no need to look up results on charts) and lots of die rolling really make this one fun for me. I enjoy how just about every aspect of football (onside kicks, fake FG's, penalties) are all represented just by a few dice. Will be looking to get expnasion teams soon.

(KIDS) Highly random, simultaneous selection game with tons of dice rolling.  These are the type of combination that would often cause me to give a game a 4 or 5 rating at best.  However, 1st and Goal does an amazing job of emulating American Football.  The mechanics for play selection and the effect of what is picked on both sides reminds me of the old-school Nintendo game, Tecmo Bowl.  The mechanics for kicking, punting, returning, running vs passing, fakes, timeouts all make the game feel even more like a football game.  I'm surprised at how much I like the game considering the masses of randomness and luck involved.

There is a separate deck of cards for the offense and defense which indicates the plays available for that down. Each player has a hand of eight cards from which they pick a card. The cards are compared the plays to determine which of the special dice are rolled. After determining the results of the play, they draw a new card and repeat the process. When the ball is turned over to the other side, players switch decks. When the last offense card is played, the half is over and another half is played. When the deck runs out a second time, the game is over.

I had fun playing it and would play any time, but I prefer [i][thing=17851]Pizza Box Football[/thing][/i] because I like having the control of calling any play I want at any time. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.4
This is a two player game in which both players share an offence and a defense deck of cards. depending on who has the ball, each player draws ten cards from their deck then they secretly select cards and reveal. Each card shows what dice are rolled by the offensive player, based on what card the other player plays. On every down a play die is rolled showing if the play was blown up in the backfield/incomplete pass, a breakaway happened, a penalty occurred, or if a turnover is possibly taking place. If everything worked out fine simply add up dice totals for on the dice to see how far the ball moves. Then both players pitch their cards(two if offensive play was a run) and set it up again. When the offensive deck runs dry it's half time. Two halves and the game is done.

This is the best football board game I've ever played... sorry Blood Bowl. Wait, does electric football count? My buddy used to hand craft guys and do a season with stats that was amazing, but other then that, it's the best. It's not without it's faults though. The game does take a fairly decent amount of time for what you actually have to do in this game. Maybe part of that is from shuffling decks between possession changes, but the run time seems to be 90-120 minutes. Probably the worst part of it though is when somebody gives up and just draws their cards at random, which is surprisingly effective on offense. The only time I saw it done was when teaching two of my friends and it forced the other player to run the same offense, at which point they both just flipped up random cards. It was infuriating for the person winning at the time, and the game abruptly ended in a fit of rage. Seems like a pretty big game flaw to have random be dominant.

So, in review, t's not the most tactical game you'll ever play. Still, if you don't take it moderately seriously, it's a blast. I wonder how it would play out in a season mode if stats were kept?

It's much easier to play than Pizza Box Football in that the play-calling greatly influences the decision. I feel that the different team dice aren't all that distinctive. However the full game can be a bit longer than I think it ought to be.

RATING: 8
Rated an 8+ with expansion teams.

Have played several times now and am very impressed by the decisions players have to make in the game. Players choose offensive and defensive plays based on the team's position on the field and their capabilities. If your team has a strong running game, you want to capitalize on that. Obviously, you're opponent will plan accordingly. This is where the deck comes in. The calls you can make are based on a hand of cards you have from a deck of plays which also doubles as the game-clock. You can burn up time with run plays or play for time with pass plays.

Since the decks for offense and defense are fixed, it's possible to count cards, though it will be difficult. As you pass roles from offense to defense, you'll pass the appropriate deck to your opponent. If there is a turn-over during the final "two minutes" you'll have a good idea of the plays available to your opponent. Time-outs offer the possibility of redrawing or tweaking your hand.

I make it sound confusing, but it is very straightforward, fairly intuitive (if you already understand football), fast, and fun. Looking forward to more plays!

...For anyone that knows me, here's the best capsule summary I can give: Cards. Dice. Decisions. It's like Commands & Colors meets Football!

Fantastic simulation of football, picking the right plays gives you an advantage but that play die adds just enough randomness that a play is broken up, or someone commits a penalty.

RATING: 4
I still haven't found a football game that can manage to capture the game and actually have the result be a fun game experience.

1st & Goal is about the best I've played, however!  The play calls actually matter, as catching the defense in a run defense vs. a passing play (or vice versa) will generally result in a very positive play, whereas not outguessing the defense will usually result in not much of anything.

However, I really dislike bluff/double-bluff games in general.  On a 3rd & 1 play, for example, the obvious play would be a running play.  However, if the defense calls a run defense and the offense ends up calling a pass, you're looking at a pretty huge gain in this game.  In real life, it wouldn't be a complete guessing game as you'd see the personnel and formation before the snap, and be able to audible out.  In a board game, you either guess correctly or poorly.

Add some dice rolling to the guessing game that can either completely negate a play, cause turnovers, etc, and I just really didn't enjoy this game, despite it being the best of the genre that I've played!

First off the components are great, I really like the magnet board with the football and yardage marker. However the game just feels too much luck of the roll, and quite honestly you can have just as good luck picking your cards randomly. Also the Play die causes too much chaos into the game, where you can just as easily break for a long touchdown or get a penalty called, which also comes down to the a die roll. 
If you are looking for a layback card and dice game with some chrome then this might be for you, however if you are looking for a football simulation forget it.

This game is way too long and repetitive for the simple gameplay it offers! But you cannot just shorten the game and only play one half because then there isn’t enough action and it’s going to be hard to make a comeback if you’re behind. But the full game is just way too long (it takes more than an hour). 

Our first game ended 21-10, so it seemed almost like a real game scoring-wise, but we did have 4 turnovers, and in our second play we got 6 turnovers in the first half alone! And no, there won’t be a third time; we tried to give the game a chance and give it the benefit of the doubt, but it is just way too tedious! Seriously, the game almost comes down to playing a card for either running or passing and then hoping the defender played the other card so you get more dice… It makes a huge difference which card you play, and yes, sure, there are times when some of the cards are much more likely to be played (and I also like that some of the cards grants you a guaranteed dice which you might need in case you’re just short a couple of yards). It felt extremely random…

Also, when you finally get the dice, you can throw awesome or horrible results – and one personal dice dictates that you might get to roll the dice again without penalty, or maybe you got unlucky and rolled the “everything misses” or perhaps the turnover; if you do roll a T (turnover), you need to roll it again, and if you get a T again, you turn over the ball. Not likely you say? Well, it happened 6 times in just one half in my second play, and I have to say that it was actually hilarious because it was so ridiculous! And in our first game the defender actually fumbled the ball into the end zone because he rolled the +1 on the black defense die – hilarious as well! So we did laugh a lot, but not because the game was awesome or fun, but because it is so horribly bad!

I did like the kick/fake cards as they add a bluffing dimension to the game, and we both bluffed and double bluffed which was quite exciting (well, perhaps not that exciting, but compared to the rest of the game it felt so…)

All things considered I found the game downright boring. It’s true, I’m not the biggest fan of American football, but I have seen several games – but the game is still not interesting. After my first playthrough I was only lukewarm and had hoped the game would be better, but after the second play I just have to admit that the game is terrible (in my opinion) and definitely not something for me. It can be summarized like this: it’s way too long, too random/has too much luck and has no interesting decisions at all.

A decent implementation of a sports game from the "coaching" rather than "playing" aspect of the game.  Have a general knowledge of football helps, but it isn't mandatory.

The game is as much about predictibility as the randomness of the dice.  Having an appreciation for expecting what your opponent will do (and then knowing that your opponent knows to expect what you are expecting) will help in the overall picture.

If you want a game that feels like football, this is it.  If you want a game that is a rigorous, statistically driven simulation of football, this is not.  I, for one, absolutely love this game.

When all is said and done, this is less a game about playing football than about creating football stories (the long field goal you made to win the game, that amazing play call that would have scored the winning touchdown if only it wasn't turned over in the end zone, the fake punt that kept your drive alive, etc.).  

Viewed from that angle, this is a near-perfect game. Besides, who doesn't love throwing fist-fulls of dice?

Rating is, admittedly, after only one two-player game.  While it is moderate fun trying to outguess your opponent, ultimately this game is an ugly luck-fest. Smart play decisions are just not rewarded as the game degenerates into being all about the guesswork.

1st & Goal is also extremely repetitive.  Extremely.  Extremely.  You do the same thing over and over again.  Of course, that's not a fair criticism as I knew this going in, but not only is it repetitive in what you do, but also in the lack of variety of outcomes.  I cannot count how many times we both rolled the red die with the play die.  Ugh.  

The game also purports to play 2-4 players, but I cannot imagine playing this with any more than two players.  It would add a healthy dose of boredom to a game that already struggles to keep you involved in anything resembling a meaningful tactical decision.   

Will play one more time to see if this gets any better.  If not, the "Memoir 44 of football games" wil go on the block.

Update: after another play - a partial play, albeit - I just had to downgrade my rating of this game.  Not impressed with it, so it's getting the boot!  (Football reference is intentional.)

Tecmo Bowl: The Boardgame but without the lucrative Football League license so I can't play as my beloved Chicago Crows or San Diego Gophers.  It's also way worse than just playing Tecmo Bowl while having about the same strategic depth.  But all is not lost!  If you buy some expansions, you'll have slightly unique teams to play against each other.  Otherwise, you are playing against a cloned team of yourself in what I assume is a dystopian future where the winner of the game will claim that they are the real one, not the clone, an go home to their family while the other clone looks sadly in the window while it rains.

An intriguing concept, somewhat lacking in execution, IMO, due to a couple of factors.  First is the premise that all cards for the same defensive formation should have the exact, same die combination possible for each execution of a given play - even the best defenses break down, on occasion. Second (and contributing to this) is the hand size, which I think is too large by two or three cards.  An overwhelming majority of the time, the player on defense is going to be able to call a defense that is simply too effective against the play being picked.

If you do not have a good understanding of the game of American Football, the rulebook can be a bit tedious and cryptic. However a few Dice Tower videos later the wife and I played a game. It is a HOOT! Working out what will be best in he situation is easy, but countering it with what the other person will play, and the dice roll! Lots of face making! The dice are big and chunky, and the magnetic board is really neat. This one is a keeper!

This is a light dice-rolling game that is very fun to play.  If you get it, you may as well get at least one expansion, as the variety in teams' strength is what makes this game more interesting.  There is virtually no down-time, with decisions happening very quickly as soon as the rules are learned by both players.

Players are coaches/quarterbacks, calling the plays and trying to win a game of American football.  Fun die rolling game where at a given time each team will either be offence, or defence, each with their own deck of cards.  A card is selected by each team, revealed and cross-referenced, which gives the combination of die rolled by the teams to determine yardage gained or lost by the offence.  The object being to run the ball into the opposing end-zone to score.  A very fun game, but lots of "fiddly" stuff in there that is rather alien to someone who knows nothing about the game.  You'll be asking yourself about touchbacks, sacks, kickoff returns, etc.  This is almost a Yomi-like guessing game to try and get the good dice to gain yardage, and there is a lot of chaos in there too courtesy of the play die.  Still, tons of fun, once you get a handle on it.  The game perhaps runs a little long, especially the full game of two halves.  Production is very nice with the magnetic football and goals.

RATING: 5.75
This is a 2 player (I know it says 4, but it really only plays well with 2) card game that simulates a game of American football.  Players play offensive or defensive formation cards in an attempt to outguess the opponent.  Certain offensive formations are more effective against certain defenses and vice versa.  The amount of dice rolled by the offense are then determined by the result of the card match-ups.  

This game is essentially a bluffing/guessing game with a lot of dice rolls.  While not a great game, it is probably one of the better football simulations out there.  I would recommend getting a couple of the expansions so players have teams with different offense and defense traits (as represented by different number distribution on the team's dice) to choose from.

A fun dice game with a bucketload of expansion pack featuring teams of wildly varying skills. The play decks are the same each time, but the yardage comparisons on each dice are different once you abandon the generic dice in the base set.

I like this game and I own it, but it didn't really click for me until recently. I was stuck on the realism or lack thereof with the play calling. The thing that clicked was how the plays on the cards are listed. Conservative plays are towards the center, riskier plays towards the top and bottom. Instead of being stuck in the "realistic" choices, I just had to decide do I want to be conservative and maximize my chances of gaining yards (or mitigating gains on defense), or go for the big play on either side of the ball. I love it!

Sweet, a quick playing two-player card driven football game that actually plays well.  

Players have card decks (play books) and choose plays and then compare - according to the result certain dice are rolled for results of the play. A simple game of out thinking/bluffing your opponent.  

The simplicity and elegance of the design added to the wealth of different teams (excellently handled by dice with different values)make a wining design.  Perfect for Sundays in the fall.

The ideas here are really cool, the playcalling and the special dice, the different teams. But what kills it in the end is it's just so dang long and repetitive. Pizza Box Football has the same problem, and so does any game that simulates a full play-by-play football game. You're doing the same thing, over and over and over, for two hours, and it's just not compelling enough.

This game is just ok for me. I am not sure what I was expecting but the randomness in dice rolls and available cards bother me. I hate the idea that I can run a short run and if the team I am playing gets a good dice roll I could lose 10+ yards...really? That would never happen in the NFL. Goal line rush might get you negative 1 or 2..but 10?

At the end of the day my son really likes it and it is fun occasionally. If you are expecting an in-depth football strategy game this is NOT it.

Another attempt to replicate American football in a board game, and this one isn't too bad. Each player chooses a play card from their hand. Depending on how well the defense predicts the offense, the results will dictate how many and which dice are rolled. The dice then provide yardage and possible surprises like interceptions or penalties.

On the whole, it works pretty well. Unfortunately, it does begin to feel a little repetitive after a while.

This is the best football game that exists and sports fans will find something to love in this one.  Where it falls short is that it can reduce itself to a bluffing kind of game.  The expansion teams provide a nice addition, but it just doesn't come to the table that often for me.

Goes up to a 7 with expansions that add flavor to a team instead of just 2 generic teams.

RATING: 3
Wanted to like this game, but the mis-matches between passing plays and pass defense results in very unrealistic play calling on third and long plays.  Basically, you have no chance of making a first down if you choose a pass play and your opponent choses pass defense.  So, you are forced into a game of bluff and counter bluff that has more to do with gamesmanship than sound football strategy.

Played this once. This is a guessing game. You and your opponent simultaneous reveal your plays. You roll dice pertaining to your play. Rinse and repeat. When you cycle through the deck twice, the game is over.
This game has virtually  no similarity to actual football.

Essentially a Yomi-style card battle transferred into a  football simulator. The components are great and the game unravels very realistically. Good fun to play with friends if you are football fanatics, although playing two full halves can drag (so we usually only play for one half).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A surprising gem.  This is a simple little football game that concentrates on the play calling aspect of the game and not much else.  It uses the same play decks regardless of which teams you use and differentiates the teams using different yardage dice.  

If you love football this is a must-have as probably the best board game interpretation out there right now.  They even got the length right - although on a certain level that makes the game a little longer than a game this light should be, it also means that a lucky play here or there won't swing the game to one side- the other side can get back in it with average luck and good play calling.  

The game also does a good job simplifying things like hail mary passes, turnovers, kicking/punting, etc. so that it can concentrate on the actual football game.  Like I said, its a surprisingly good game.

I do have one complaint.  Due to how the playcalling works, you are forced into situations where you call totally unrealistic plays for the situation.  3rd and long is one example.  Even with a very good passing team, you can't call a long pass play because you know your opponent is likely to call a pass defense which almost always results in a problem for you.  You are better off calling a short run because of the interactions of the cards.  Strange but true.  Similarly on 3rd and 1, instead of doing a "sure thing" run play a pass of some kind is your best option.  Not realistic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The latest and greatest football simulation. Players select a team from the dozens of available teams (through expansions) that will vary wildly in terms of their passing, running, and defensive abilities. Unfortunately, that's about all the variance there is, which basically amounts to their custom dice having different numbers on them. It would have been nice to see special powers or cards to really add some personality to this multitude of teams. Even so, this game avoids some of the common pitfalls of games like this by having the plays called come from a deck of cards. Compare the offense card against the defense card, roll dice, see what happens. Much simpler than doing chart lookups. This deck of cards also acts as the game clock, with running plays burning more cards than passing plays. When the deck runs out, so does the half. Timeouts can be used to prevent cards from being burned, or to select specific plays. Those two mechanics are very thematic and something I haven't seen used before. Because of the ability to roll a "breakout", no amount of yardage is too great to overcome, just like in real football.

The components are really nice as well. The board is small, but magnetic, which allows the ball and first down marker to stick to it, preventing accidental bumping of the table from ruining your game. Cards are glossy and thick, and the dice are chunky with inset stickers and the team logo on each die.

Sports games are tough to do right, I think. The closer they are to reality, the more boring it is. For most sports, the rules structure isn't the interesting part, it's the "dexterity element" if you will. Football is probably the most board-game-like of any of them due to the stoppages between each play, but a board game still can't match the thrill of the real thing. I think some of that comes not just from seeing the big breakout play, but caring about the team and players who are making the play. Given that, something like Blood Bowl or even Battleball would probably be my choice over this.

I don't have an especially deep understanding of football, but I enjoy the sport. 1st & Goal scratches the itch to play a football-based boardgame without getting mired in stats and rules complications. The result is a game that seems realistic enough and quite playable. The game gives me the same sort of feeling of a narrative that I get from watching a game. On the downside I'd say it's just a bit longer than it ought to be... I may remove one or two copies of each card from the O Deck to see if that helps.

The game is fairly inventive. I liked that the magnetic board helps keep track of your football and ten yard marker. The game was easy to follow. The offense and defense cards were self explanatory. Once the plays on the cards were matched up, the players knew which dice to role. 

However, since I am not a fan of football, the plays on the cards did not make sense to me other than of the colors of the dice that could be rolled based on what card the opponent played. It was very "play a card and roll" for me simply because I did not always follow the theme. 

This is a great game for a football fan, especially for the casual gaming football fan. Just not for me though.

Really fun game.  I can't help doing commentary (in a fake American accent) when I play.

Keen to try variants:

[q="rwould"]Instead of adding all the dice together take the highest number die (obviously not for special teams play).[/q]


[q="sarafettle"]1st & Goal: Nasty, Tournament Variant


Dice Selection:
The tournament director chooses a set of dice to be used by ALL players during the tournament.

Deck Building:
Each player has is own offense and defense deck. The game now consists of 4 quarters. At the beginning of each quarter, each player selects 15 defense and 15 offense cards for use during the quarter. A quarter ends when the first offense deck is exhausted. If a defense deck is exhausted, re-shuffle the deck, without changing its composition. 

In addition to the original time-out actions, during a time-out a player may exchange 1 card (from his offense or defense deck, and in-hand or the deck, but not from the discards) from the original pool of cards, do not add any cards in hand to the newly selected deck, shuffle the deck. 

A broken play result now requires rolling a six-sided die, on a 1-5 ignore the original broken play result and play as if the result were a regular play.

After one play, I'll say that this game captures what I think it would feel like to coach a football game excellently. With the different dice and rules, I believe they have accounted for almost everything that happens in a game (2 possible exceptions: both turnovers and penalties are much more rare than they should be). That said, the game can drag a little (like football sometimes does) and, even with timeouts, bad draws can all too often leave you with a handful of running plays on third and long with no options. I'm giving it a 6. Not because it's not a great football board game (it is), but because I'm only occasionally in the mood to play a football board game.

Football-themed game in which the offensive team picks either a running or passing play, the defence team picks a counter type, and then -- comparing the names of the cards -- determining the dice that affect yardage.

This game will see many more plays in 2013 and I'll be curious to see how balanced the teams are.  I suggested a wind variant which affects punts and field goal attempts.

Simulates football decently enough, but game becomes repetitive after multiple replays. Expansion teams do not look worthwhile as far as adding new depth to the game.

Haven't played any other football games (other than Juke 'Em which had a thin veneer of theme) but this one is top notch.

This is a decent light football game.  The cards are an elegant way of getting the same results as an old fashioned results matrix and they also handle the question of timing nicely.  My main problem with this and other football simulations is that they encourage you to play counter to conventional football strategy.  Is third and twelve.  If your opponent calls a pass defense you are almost completely sunk, you are probably better off calling a run.  Yes, that does occur in real football but it is very rare.  Often the defense expects play, the offense calls play and the play comes off perfectly anyway. This thus becomes an elaborate name of rock paper scissors rather than the amusing light simulation of football that it wants to be.

A nice light game, a little longer than it should be.
However a nice simulation of a football game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
We've played this about 6 times. It's a fun game, and most of the components are nice. The cards are really thick and durable (you each flip for every play so they're heavily used). The board has great graphics and is magnetic so it holds the football and down marker nicely. Unfortunately the magnetic strip in our board is slightly off center so the down marker will only hold to one side. The dice could be better. You have to put stickers on them. They should have come painted or even engraved.

Turns are straight-forward and involve flipping cards simultaneously and then rolling the appropriate number and colour of dice according to the combined results of the offense and defense. If both the offense and defense call the same type of play, the offense won't get much yardage. However, if they don't, then the offense can potentially get a LOT of yards. This can be frustrating at times. Fortunately there are other results, including breaking up the play, penalties, and turnovers. 

The latter is where the game should be tweaked. There are far too many turnovers in this game. In one game I had 4 turnovers, which is ridiculous. I read somewhere about adding a d6 die to affect turnover potential, so we may try that. 

One thing to consider is who to play this with, as well as how football minded you are. Playing with a football-minded person might see you both expecting a passing play on 3rd down if you've got a lot of yardage to make up. Playing with a non-football person could generate more random play calling, simply because they aren't thinking about the differences between passing and running. Our last game involved using two expansion teams - Knights vs. Thunder. Be careful when choosing teams. My Thunder's strong defense was no match for my partner's amazing offense with the Knights. 
Another point worth mentioning is the burning cards element. When you call a running play you have to 'burn' an extra card from the draw pile to simulate the play clock ticking down. It is REALLY easy to forget to do this. I wish there was a better system to track it. A final point is on game length - only once have we played past halftime. It often takes an hour for one half.
Nevertheless, it's a game we keep going back to. It is very satisfying to score a touchdown, and final scores are realistic.

Probably the best American Football board game out there.  Easy to learn and play.  Great to play with kids and in general a good family game. 

Many expansions that allow you to play different team styles.

Although mainly chance based, 1st & Goal is a pretty fun football game with some strategy. Players have to pick from a hand of 8 plays on offense and defense, roll dice according to play selection, and try to guess their opponent's choice and get good results. It's more luck and bluff than real football strategy.

I'm a big fan of (American) football, but all of the boardgames I've played about the sport are too fiddly, and they drain away the excitement. 1st & Goal does better than most (MUCH better than PBF), but still isn't as fast & fun as I'd like. The non-licensed teams are understandable, but still a letdown.

This was my second-ever sports game, and like the first it was surprisingly enjoyable even for a non-sports guy like myself. The magnetic board is fantastic, and apart from the too-similar player and ref dice the dice are quite nice despite being stickered.

There's a good amount of luck involved, as the player die is part of every roll and you have zero control over it, but there's also a pleasing amount of strategy and bluffing in the card plays.

Fun game.   It is not something you are going to pull out if you want a brain burner but a nice bluffing and dice rolling game.  It really is probably a 6 unless you have a league going which is where it shines.  I also suggest making an X on a pass being an incomplete instead of the current rules but as written works fine as well.

It is actually quite a tense little struggle of wits..  Should I go for a run or a pass.  I like the idea of burning up the clock with extra use of cards..  I also will apply the d20 variant which makes it a lot more realistic.

Reminds me of Techo Bowl back in the 90's...  Minus the graphics of the touchdown dance with confetti.

Hope this game does well as I would love to see football get its game!

I'm liking this so far. Lots of chaos and some decent strategy. Each game has some exciting events and stories BUT I'm still not sure if there is enough input from e coach to keep it interesting in the long run.

I'm actually interested in this as an alternate fast play ruleset for Bloodbowl but it would need to play faster to be worth the effort. Reducing the number of cards in the offense deck would be a quick way to shorten the game.

This is quick and simple but it's possible to play well either by being entirely random or by just looking at die colors on the results table. For about two quarters it's fun and then it just feels like a grind.

Most disappointing game I've played to date.  There have been games I played that I knew I probably wouldn't like and ended up not liking them...but this is something else.  People actually like this game and it had good hype.  I was so excited to get this and it's nothing but chucking dice. Yes, the mechanics match the theme, but the game itself is long and boring. Complete mess.

I'm having a hard time appreciating this game as much I think it deserves. Mostly due to my indifference to football in general. I bought this game for my son for Christmas as he's the football fan in the house. Assembling the dice (stickering) was a bit of a drag but other than that we enjoyed our first game. The components are nice but the game is heavily luck driven using dice for yardage determination. I felt a little limited by the card drafting mechanics and card play restrictions. It's a nice simulation game but the game play won't strike a chord with those with a taste for euro/strategy game play. I recommend at least one expansion to give you some variance in game play as it gives you difference yardage spreads on the dice as a way to represent strong defense or offense. IMPORTANT: If you dislike stickering blank dice, you're going to have a bad time.

Have played this game twice now. Each time I am impressed with just how well it simulates coaching football. The die distribution for teams is interesting and even though you're essentially playing a game of yahtzee, it's a yahtzee that manages to feel competitive. It does this through clever representation of choice and consequence. That, combined with the constraint of the play deck really created a sense of really feeling immersed in coaching a team as they fought against another.

I played part of a game with my son and enjoyed it, although he thought it was completely luck based.  Then I played part of a game with my wife, and I started to see what he meant.  Then I played a single half of the game solo using completely random draws for my opponent and making some basic assumptions (4th down on the 25 or inside is a field goal attempt, for example).  At the end of the half, it was 10-3, and I didn't have the 10.  The idea is cool, but the mechanics lead to absurd play calls totally unlike football.  On 3rd and 1, you might as well call a bomb pass, because if the defense does any kind of run defense, you are almost guaranteed to get your yards (unless the play die shows a black X, then you get no yardage, but that's true of all plays).  Cool components, cool concept, disappointing gameplay.

I think this really captures the feeling of an armchair coach for american football. Without getting into the "nitty-gritty" of executing plays, you can simulate the coaching decisions (not the individual player decisions). There is a lot of randomness, but no more so than a given actual game of football has. :) I enjoy it, though the games are just slightly longer than they should be (still enjoy it though).

Probably the Best Football Game out there! Great Fun! You don't have to be a football fanatic to enjoy this game. Plays great! My wife and I are to the point where we can just pull it out and play a half in under 20 minutes.

Players pick the plays; the dice determines the outcome.

Magnetic board! Quality cards! Timer for the halves built into the offensive card deck play. Good mix of luck and strategy.

Need to put stickers on the dice ahead of time.

It helps to know about football though eventually to understand all of this game. The rules are a little difficult at first, only because it explains the mechanics of the board game play, without going into explaining the game of football from the ground up. My advice is to play the game generally, and ease into the more specifics as you wish to explore them, on side kicks, 2 point conversions, etc.

Utterly terrific components. Football field is laid out with magnetic components and first down markers. Looks great on the table.

The gameplay is solid for what it is trying to do. Outwit your opponent on the play call and you will be rewarded by driving down the field. Some times you are at the fate of the dice, like in any dice game.

Amazing that only a handful of dice can accommodate so many aspects of football including field goals, kickoffs, breakaways, fumbles, etc.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A fun little football game.  The dice help introduce an element of uncertainty to the game that reflects the fact that the players aren't perfect, and perfect play calling can only take you so far.

The rulebook is somewhat disorganized, and there's a bit more complexity than I like with all of the special types of plays (onside kick, hail mary, spiking the ball, 2 point conversion, etc), but I appreciate that these types of plays are included.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game attempts to be a simulation of a football game.  It does some things very well in that regard.  I did like the "breakaway" potential that increased the chance of a big play that would build and build if the rolls were right.  I also like the way clock management worked, with timeouts allowing you to draft plays from the discard deck, so you could squeeze in a few extra plays.  
As a simulation though, a few issues miss the mark.  For example, playing a goal line defense on second and 10 at mid-field because you think your opponent might run, or losing 15 yards on a dive play because your opponent figured out a run play.  The penalty system was also clunky, especially the potential for an automatic first down on a run play.  Also, turnovers are totally random and game changing, no matter what type of play you run.  Overall, managing a drive was interesting, but the game with the default rules is too long.

1st & Goal does a reasonably good job of simulating a game of American Football.  There are turnovers, penalties, breakaway touchdowns... its all there.  I feel the designers did a very nice job of giving you the "feel" of football and still keeping the game light and relatively quick.  So far it has been a hit with the family, especially with the expansion teams.  

Pros:  
 - Plays quickly for a football game.  Should complete a game in just over an hour - faster if both players are familiar with the system.
 - Gives mostly "realistic" scores and has a good feel to the game.
 - Easy to understand.  Even those somewhat unfamiliar with football (ie my wife) are able to play and enjoy the game.
 - Very cool magnetic board with magnetic football.  Cards are nice and glossy - should hold up well.

Cons:
 - Dice require stickers.  I know this was to decrease cost but I don't like it.  Takes a bit of time to put them on, they look tacky, and I am unsure how they will hold up over time.
 - I wish there were a few more offenses/defenses that weren't *quite* so heavily influenced by you guessing "run" or "pass" correctly.  In fact, playing someone who knows little of real football can be difficult, as they may choose "bomb" on 3rd and 1 and burn the heck out of you.  Or maybe real NFL teams should throw bombs on 3rd and short more often ;).

If you like the football theme, then you will most likely enjoy the game. 

While it may look like it is "just" a dice rolling game, the main mechanic of the game is bluffing the opponent. However, when the bluffin only involves two possible options ('Run' or 'Pass') much of the gameplay becomes very repetetive. This is not necessarily a bad thing... except that a single game can easily take up to about 2 hours.

The expansions add a lot of new teams - dice pools with different numerical values depending on the teams strengths (Run, Pass, or Defence) - to the game, giving the players more elements to use when bluffing, which makes the game more interesting and unpredictable.

I enjoy playing, but with the current rules I am also ready to stop as soon as the clock runs out. If the game could be shortened to just 1 hour or less, then I think it would improve the game consideraly.

 I really like how this game is able to boil down football to a deck of cards and handful of dice. This is not a hardcore simulation, but it still gets the feel of football.

Trying to guess what the opponent is going to do, and weighing the options available to me is a lot of fun and really delivers to make this an engaging game

This is a very light, mindless dicey football game. 

It's a little too far removed from football for my tastes, as I don't like the combinations of dice that are selected when comparing offense and defense.

This game is dice-rolling based American football game. It assumes some knowledge of basic American football rules (which I admittedly have some gaps). It is light and the strategic decisions are both general and dependant on dice rolls, but it is not designed to be a deep simulation or heavy stats based game. Those wanting deep intricacies of plays, rules, individual player tactics and realism would not find this game for them, but those who don’t mind broad generalisations, rules abstracted to fit dice and cards, and a healthy dose of luck through dice rolls can find enough to enjoy. However, the game may be a little long for what it is.

A nice implementation of football, and for those that are really into the game, it's pretty fun. You get to roll a bunch of dice, but the plays are realistic and it's very much a battle of wits. I still find myself wanting to watch a real game on TV more than playing this, but it's nice for getting your occasional football fix.

More streamlined and with more options than Pizza Box football.  I like it but there is a healthy dose of chance.  Just like coaching a real game I suppose.

I thought this would go over well with non-gamer sports fans but one of my friends described this as "like playing a video game with an abacus."

Rock, paper, Scissors ....football! I really like the bluff and counter bluff in this game, sort of reminds me of Yomi. I was worried that the fact each team is the same would detract, but it does not - maybe longer term it will need the expansion dice. Theres the rub, I cant see myself finding too many opponents so maybe the vase game will suffice.

Might not be many football games out there, but regardless, this is the best one. A fun "rock, paper, scissors" type game that uses dice, and cards to play out the outcome of each play. The components are great: magnetic football and first down marker to keep it from sliding around. Absolutely love the expansions where they introduce divisions with multiple teams.

American Football played with specialised dice and cards. Recreates an exciting game. Magnetic board and ball is a neat touch too
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun game designed to scratch the itch of playing football from a coaching perspective.  Play calling based on a hand of cards and the dice rolled for specific play outcomes between offense and defense makes sense.  Could be a fun beer and pretzel style game especially at playoff and superbowl parties.

Looking forward to getting the divisional expansion teams and possibly running a season.  

Not my all time favorite football themed board game, but very accessible and enjoyable!

A light dicefest with some interesting decisions and hand management aspects. It offers, perhaps, less control than Pizza Box Football but more decisions. As such, it is probably the more accurate simulation, even though it does seem to feel pretty similar in game play.

Fun enough and if I didn't already own PBF, I'd probably pick this up.

Update: The dice really just make too much of an impact in this game. I can see how it is meant to simulate the variable outcomes in a real game, but it just feels too swingy here. Even the 2-12 variation of the dice in Pizza Box Football isn't so bad as it is here...

Rating down from 7.2 to 6.5.

RATING: 5
Pretty much like Rock, Paper, Scissors with a football theme, of course, that's kind of true with Football too.  Except of course, these teams are more balanced, so it's not about talent like it is in real football.

In any case, it's fun enough for the football fan, I think I slightly prefer Pizza Box Football, however, this one is way quicker to play, and still fun, and they are so close, I kept this one over PBF.

Very strong theme - you feel you play a football game. It doesn`t matter that you can usually get more yards with a passing play.

You get to less points. I won 7:2. When you score a touchdown you almost won the game. The field is too long - it`s too hard to get many yards.

EDIT: After 2nd game: Scoring was not so hard like in the 1st game (10:13), but the game is a little bit to long. At the end you are tired of making the same things for to long time.

1st and Goal does a very nice job of capturing the feel of a football game within a simple rule set.  It can feel a little random with the dice, but that doesn't bother me.  I don't play a lot of sports simulations, but this would be my go-to if I wanted to play one.

I played a pre-production copy of this at the 2011 Gathering of Friends. This is a gem - simple enough for casual players who might stumble across this because of its theme but complex enough to satisfy more serious game players. It also allows some interesting tactics as players decide which offensive and defensive plays to run, I'm definitely looking forward to seeing this one in its finished form!

For football fans only. The game is incredibly random and you have almost no control over what happens. However, if you watch American football, you know that it is often very similar. Fumbles, penalties, and bad plays can have a huge, unexpected effect on a footaball game, just as they can on 1st & Goal. The game actually does a good job of including rules for most real-life football situations: onside kicks, quarterback sneak from the one yard line, running out the clock, fake field goals, and so on.

Not bad for a football game, really, but just very random.

Sold.

Great. I like American Football (Packers!) but I don't understand it deeply. I'd never play something like Strat-o-matic. I tried to put together a chess/wargame-like game myself - it was just too fiddly.

This is nice. Play a card in an educated rock-paper-scissors-way (trying to outguess the opponent), roll the dice and see what happens.

Though it can be played without thinking about football (the colours of the dice will tell you which card to choose), it's only fun if you do. If your opponent is a football fan him/herself and you want to beat him/her in your own superbowl.

My mates and me consider a league in Hamburg, Germany.

Promising, but ultimately disappointing.  Great components, better than any other football sim out there.  The magnetized first down marker and football are great ideas, and the mounted board and cards are both high quality.  I do wish the dice were a little smaller and came molded so that I didn't have to sticker all of them, but that's a small complaint.

The gameplay, though, lacks a soul.  In real football, a run is usually a conservative playcall, not likely to gain more than about 7 yards, but also unlikely to be stopped for no gain, whereas a pass is much more risky, but prone to big gains.  This game doesn't preserve that dynamic.  A run here against a pass defense can easily gain 20+ yards.  Furthermore, there are run defenses that are virtually guaranteed to shut down every run.  The result is a very cold-feeling game, one that flattens decisions to a simple rock-paper-scissors style guessing game.

If you're looking for a light football sim, you'll be better served tracking down an old version of [gameid=1498] or [gameid=3226] on eBay or on the marketplace here.

A fun beer and pretzels game that puts you in the coaches shoes. We played a four player game with each team having one guy play offense and one play defense.

Yikes, the playcalling is too skewed to extreme results. HB Dive for -6 on average vs. Goal Line? That's just stupid. Runs seem inferior overall, though clearly better on 3rd and long, which is again stupid.

There's a nice system here, but I think I'll have to use house rules to avoid chucking it in disgust. Certainly nowhere near as good as Football Strategy out of the box.

I love this game for what it is.  What it's not is a football simulation.  It's dice rolling fun with fantasy teams that you can play to their advantage.  It's fast action with cheers and jeers.  Makes for a fun family game or even lightweight league competition. I've added the Northwest, and Southwest Divisions to my set.

A fun dice game with bluffing and guessing. We only played half a game and that took about an hour and a half, but I assume some of that was due to learning the game and watching the Olympics at the same time. I'd be happy to play it again, but I hope after learning it a full game only takes an hour and change, otherwise we'll only be playing half games of it.

RATING: 8.1
Bought to play with my son, but have already solo played it three times. The components are superb - especially the moulded dice in the base game.

Update: Where 1st & Goal wins over another dice roller such as Escape: The Curse of the Temple is in telling a story. Escape is tense because of the timer, but that timer means you rush through it and aren't left with anything but a win or lose at the end. Which is fine for a ten minute game, and that rush is great. But if you have even a passing interest in American Football 1st & Goal tells a story of a game; even randomly drawing cards solitaire for a half is satisfying and leaves you with a sense of accomplishment.

Update 2: Okay, it's unrealistic and best played without too much thought. If a player has Cover on defence there is very little reason not to play it, or a player can find themselves with nothing but a hand of rushing defence cards. But for a quick light game it does what it does well and looks nice.

A fun little tabletop game. Certainly not a replacement for stat-heavy football games and it is a much more satisfying experience with perhaps 2 of the expansions. The team dice are adequate in the base game, but for a better, individualized team experience, getting team dice that are asymmetrically balanced, (some better at running, some passing, some defense etc.), permits a more realistic approach to playing out this game. 

All in all though, it works, the mechanisms are valid and between the cards and the dice, they work well at simulating gameplays. 

This is not about building teams and accumulating stats on players. This is about out-guessing your opponent on the field through each down, throwing the dice to see the plausible outcome, and then groaning to a fumble, leaning to a perfect pass, holding your breath through an amazing run or thrilling to the touchdown.
It is above all, fun.

I don't like football and I don't like really random games. Yet this football game with virtually no strategy or skill to it is actually very very fun. I can't help but scream out "Touchdown" and "Interception" and other nonsense to every single play. I really get into the spirit of it even though I have virtually no clue how football works and there is no way to plan your plays.

A bit interested in the system of pulling action tiles from a bag and slotting them onto a grid, but we'll see if I get a chance to get it "on the table"!

1 play / 3 players

LIKE: Unique action selection mechanism, using sliding tiles. Simple, quick actions that make the game go fast. Some random elements, but it's a light enough game that it adds to the playability.

DISLIKE: The theme is dusty, old. The iconography seemed odd to me, not intuitive. The church prop is not really needed.

OVERALL: It's a good, light game but not something that I would revisit often, because it is too dusty of a theme. Get past that and it's quite fun. I wonder if it had a more interesting theme, perhaps it would add extra charm to the game.

Interesting mechanic of central grid but whole game feels abstract and doesn't coorespond to its theme.

A pretty decent modern euro.  The 3 x 3 action selection grid that action chits are pushed on to and off of strikes me as quite original and it works well.  The concept of progressing along the river while gaining influence and using special actions along its banks is also quite neat.  My problem with Ulm lies in its deck of cards, in which some cards provide extra resources and some offer end of game bonuses.  It's the luck of the draw whether you get what you need at a particular stage of the game and whether you can complete that high scoring set.

Ulm is a good looking game and its production values are high.

It's a good game. The action selection system is unique and enjoyable puzzle.  Lots of options to pursue, but plays very smooth. Shorter play time is a plus. Seems like this one might be under appreciated. 

Menzel's art is fantastic as always. Components, especially the tiles, are great.

A pleasant medium weight euro with a novel "push on a 3 x 3 grid of available actions" mechanic that feels fresh and fun to play around with each turn.  Additional mechanics include:  mellow card effects and card set collection, and in our four player game, an amusing "hop scotch" race, down the river.  Don't get too far behind the pack!  

Lacking theme, this simple euro relies upon a mellow combination of novelty, mechanics and player interaction.  I found it to be a nice, short, friendly euro with just enough fizziness to make me smile.

Love the mini game to determine which actions you get. Leads to some tough choices, and the sparrow tiles let you work your way out of pinches here necessary. However, it seems like the trading cards are way too random and it is extremely hard to get points effectively in that manner. Maybe it could be house ruled to draw 2 keep 1 and draw 4 keep 1 instead of the current 1-1 and 2-1.

First game.  4 player.  All enjoyed.  Play options and combos work nicely, with the 3 x 3 grid sufficiently interesting and limiting.  We struggled toward the end as no money action tiles got drawn and there non in the loading docks either which had a knock on effect that the seals were difficult to place.  Maybe introduce a 2:1 or 3:1 action tile swap (house rule) would alleviate this.  But I anticipate each game will be different and look forward to further plays.  Split rule book worked reasonably well, despite initial reservations.

Veel te veel downtime.
Je kan op voorhand niet inschatten wat je kan doen, omdat het bord van mogelijkheden verschuift.  Dat is juist ook de leuke dynmaic van het spel...
Beter met 2 of 3 ?

Zeker geen slecht spel maar voor mij slechts een 6.  Ik heb te weinig tijd om te spelen, en dan zit deze toch onderaan het spectrum.  Ik wil er geen ganse avond aan besteden.

Lots of interlocking mechanisms with a "point salad" vibe to it ( which I enjoy ). Very fast gameplay, the action selection mechanism is neat. 

It rewards focusing on a certain strategy. Some people complain about luck of the draw regarding the deck of cards. I didn't find this to be an issue, since we almost cycled through the entire deck in a 2-player game. Bottom line, you have to commit to your strategy early on, in order to not make the game seem "random".

Quite nice euro game. Interesting and fresh action activation mechanism. A lot of decisions to make, a lot of things to get points from. Unfortunately, luck-driven set collection on cards is not a good idea to be mixed with rest of this game.

RATING: 6
An interesting game, but feels limiting in what you can do with both you boat position and the tiles you draw form the bag.  Also this games suffers from a 'one turn too late' problem where things can happen that make your life difficult, but couldn't have been prevented by you because it all happened between your turns and you just have to deal with it.  Plus if you advance too quickly with the boats trying to get the lead position, you end up limiting yourself even more with final actions, making it hard to use those last few turns to try and catch up.

A decent game marred by some clunky and overly chance-heavy mechanics. I love the action grid, which is the heart of the gameplay, and I like how area control of the grid works via the sparrows (which can be either points or special advantages). I am not a fan of the draw deck (which the game very unthematically just calls "the cards" with no other explanation).  Since there is no open card market, and only a limited ability for players to mitigate draws, the cards are simply too random considering they are such an important generator of points. I also think the randomness of the coats of arms tiles makes for too swingy of a strategy game like this. Sold.

Günter Burkhardt has designed a lot of games and the few I've played have been good~very good (Delphi, Darjeeling, Maori & Von Kap Bis Kairo) but I reckon this is my favourite of the lot. The central action tile-swap-matrix drives the game well, giving you tough choices each turn and, crucially, some control over the randomness. More please.

The way actions are selected through "pushing" I thought was cool and innovative. It is nice to play something with a different feel. However, I thought the card action had a ton of randomness that essentially decides the game. Everyone is generally keeping up on the river, getting a couple of shields placed etc. It didn't feel like I was making a lot of interesting decisions. Get some money and chits, spend to place disks, keep up on river, repeat. I think everyone was within a point of each other at the end of this, which is not surprising. Meh

The action mechanism is great, but I had one of the most horrible euro gaming experience while playing Ulm. Imagine nearly all the systems designed to mitigate the luck factor in a euro game failed in the same game - 1) 8 out of the 10 rounds, I drew THE type of action tile that I didn't need for that round; 2) I put 2 discs in the action area and ended up receiving 2 or 3 bird tiles in the whole game, while other players had piles of them in front at the end.

The city of Ulm didn't have a game with its name: let's fix it!
Ulm is a rehash of euro-style mechanics but has no clear focus on what should you do to score points.
At the beginning of the game you think "oh, God, kill me now because everything looks so random in this points salad" but at the end you think "oh, God, options are so limited and useless in this disgusting stagnant city." The random drawing of tiles and cards makes everything weird and proper planning is almost impossible. I think it is a mediocre game that deserves a deep re-thought.

Bonus track: The board is confusing because it is "too pictorial". It is a spreadsheed pasted on a postcard. Please, editors of board games: remember to keep it simple and useful. This is a disgusting trend in current board design.

Non, ce n'est pas un cri barbare. Un cri barbare, c'est plutôt CROM ! (les joueurs de Conan comprendront). ULM, c'est un ville. Une ville d'Allemagne proche du Danube. Vous le voyez arriver, le jeu de gestion à l'allemande avec une mécanique bien huilée mais sur un thème peu présent ? (comme beaucoup de jeux portant le nom d'une ville (Orléans, Bruxelles,Bruges, Quebec et j'en passe ...) . Ben c'est exactement ça ! Vous allez devoir réaliser des actions selon une mécanique d'insertion de tuiles plutôt intéressante pour récupérer des ressources, vous placer dans des quartiers, avancer votre barque sur le Danube, etc... Le speech d'intro ? Vous êtes des marchands au moyen-age et vous voulez prospérer. Celui qui aura le plus de points de victoire gagne. Funky, non ? Mais ne vous arrêtez pas à ce speech car les parties sont plutôt intéressantes pour les amateurs de ce genre de jeux (dont je fais partie).

RATING: 8
Elegant eurogame in which all the different game elements are nicely knit together. Each player is a family in medieval Ulm trying to become the major family of the town by planting their coat of arms in certain city quarters and performing different actions as they move through the town on their ship. The actions a player can take are determined by means of tiles which are drawn from a bag. Each turn a player draws 1 tile and pushes it into a row or column of a 3x3 action square. The action pushed into this action box and the 2 actions which are left in the row or column into which the new tile was pushed are the 3 actions that the player can perform. There are 5 different action tiles (1.move, 2.take money, 3.seal an action in a city quarter (this costs 2 money, and if one of the players has his coat of arms in this quarter he will receive 2 points each time a player performs an action in that quarter), 4.take or play a card, 5.take all the tiles which have been pushed out of the 3x3 action box on one and the same side of this box). Once a certain row or column has been used, it can no longer be used by another player, until somebody takes the tiles from 1 side of the action box, or until there are no rows or columns left to move. In the latter case all the tiles that were pushed out of the action box go back into the bag. The 12 positions on the side of the 3x3 action square also represent one of the 12 city quarters. A player who plants his coat of arms in a city quarter will also put a marker on the corresponding position. Each time a player pushes a row or column towards his marker, he will receive a special tile by means of which he can switch the action tile he draws from the bag for one of the action tiles in a display on the board. These special switch tiles also count for 1 point at the end of the game (this is not the case for money, so there is no use saving that). In one of the quarters the players can obtain special character tiles by means of which they can bend the rules of the game (double money, double speed, possibility to switch the tile drawn from the bag for a tile in your posession, possibility to choose a card from the top 2 cards in the deck without having to hand over 2 identical tiles. Normally handing over 2 different tiles, implies that you can just take the top card from the card deck.) The cards introduce a lot of different ways to gain points, and also to perform different actions. Each round also starts by drawing a special tile which bends the rules for all the players during that round. The players can also see what the special rule will be in the next round, so they can prepare for this. All these different elements fit together very well.

It's ok, but nothing that great here.  And the regular game where you use the bonus round marker ability is broken!

If we got it wrong, I'll bump it up a point.

The first thing you notice about this game is how dark and busy it is.   The background scenery and art completely hinders any kind of usability.   It's too bad, because Michael Menzel does good work, but the graphic design here has ruined it.  Very messy work.

The game moves pretty quickly through 10 turns, most of which are very mechanical.   In fact, the whole game is pile of disconnected and awkward mechanisms that don't sit very well together at all.   The theme doesn't connect with any of these mechanisms.

One good thing, though:  the 3x3 action selection grid which works like a slider puzzle.  That bit is clever.   But one clever bit isn't enough to make the rest of the game worth playing very often for me, anyway.   It's worth a look for that mechanism, but I feel like this game has a very low ceiling.   Perhaps that action selection mechanism will see the light of day again in a different game.

A very tight game which is a tad too random for me. If you draw the wrong tile at the wrong time and are out of sparrows, you may have literally nothing to do in a given turn (and sparrows can be quite hard to come by). The set collection mechanic is quite random, too, as you have very few opportunities to draw and play cards, and you are not guaranteed a set. Overall, not a game I like.

RATING: 6.5
The action selection grid here is really interesting and fairly unique, and makes for some interesting decisions, as what you slide out of the grid could be just what your opponent needs, or indeed may instantly benefit them if they have claimed the building you slide over. 

The idea of progressing down the river turn after turn gaining influence and other benefits along its banks is nice, as sometimes you just have to float on past certain actions, or risk big points loss at the end of the game. 

The cathedral turn timer mechanic is very superfluous and actually when placed on the board gets in the way of game play information, which is a little frustrating.

Cards are very random and the set collection in particular is very hard, but I do like that all cards can be used for an immediate effect or saved until end of game.

Ulm's unique selling proposition is the grid-based action selection mechanism that the game is constructed around. It's a little gimmicky but generally works pretty well, and the advance of the boats on the river opens windows of opportunity just as easily as it closes them. There are, however, several aspects that heavily detract from that positive first impression.
First of all, the actions that you can select from are very situational, and there are far too many occasions where a large part of the available choices are entirely unattractive or entirely dead actions because you don't have an opportunity to actually use them. In these situations it is not about finding the best combination of actions but simply about minimizing dead actions. Frustrating. Secondly, there seems to be a significant first player advantage (or last player disadvantage) with the event tiles. This could have been easily fixed (just move the start player around).
The heavy luck in the card draws wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing in a family game. Especially the first issue, however, would keep me from recommending the game to anyone.

Huch, Hutter und Burkhardt. In der Vergangenheit nicht gerade Garanten für außergewöhnliche Spielekreationen. ULM pusht die Erkenntnis, dass man aus Erfahrungen in der Vergangenheit keine Festschreibungen für die Zukunft ableiten sollte. Denn ULM überrascht. Der Kernmechanismus ist neu: eine 3x3 Felder Matrix aus Aktionssteinen, in die man von jeder Seite einen aus dem Beutel gezogen Aktionsstein einschiebt und dann die 3 geschobenen Aktionen in beliebiger Reihenfolge ausführt. Diverse Elemente aus der kleinen Welt des Eurogames greifen hübsch und organisch ineinander. So hübsch und organisch, dass dabei trotz ein paar orchestrierter Zwänge und Glückslastigkeiten ein überdurchschnittliches Eurogame herausgekommen ist. Wahrscheinlich Günter Burkhards bestes. Bruddler, die auch ULM das existierende Unperfekte finden, gibt es auch natürlich auch in der schwäbischen Provinz. 7/10 für das gelungene Spieldesign, 8/10 für die persönliche Kinderüberraschung.

A two player game flies past, taking little more than 30 minutes. There are not major amounts of interaction but since all players are using the same constantly shifting action grid and placing on the same board this game is far from multiplayer solitaire. Ulm might not be a headline Essen release and doesn’t stray too far from the typical eurogame template but the innovative action selection grid and the way this seamlessly interacts with barge movement and seal positioning makes Ulm one of the best mid-weight euro’s I have played for quite a while. I also like how the action tiles also serve as a commodity that can be used to purchase and activate the cards.

About as Euro you can get. It's a point salad, and there are many ways to serve yourself some tasty points. The board is beautiful, but a bit difficult to read. The iconography is ok, but there is a lot of it, and a lot of looking up things. The coolest part by far is pushing tiles to get your three actions. This is the best part of the game. For me, this is a fine game, but it's not jumping out at me.

It's a fine game with some neat ideas, but all in all it doesn't feel any new. It feels like they took parts from other games and mixed them. Also, the random elements are too important, to be random in a game like this.

The tiles matrix is an original mechanism but also add some downtime because you can't plan your turn ahead.  The rest of the game is well balanced but a bit bland.  Huge first player advantage if events are used.  Hoping for a fix from the designer or editor.

It's not bad. The central mechanic of sliding a tile across a matrix is interesting, but that's about it to this game.

The key thing that I spotted with this game early on is that you should take the best move for you, without leaving the board wide open for the player on your left. Since there is often 2/3 options that are equally good do the one that screws him the most.

Nick got this aspect and screwed me, I got this aspect and screwed Mark,,, Mark looked after number one and gave Nick a clean run. Moral of the story - sit on Marks left or better still pick a better game.

RATING: 6
According to the BGG rating scale, I should rate this a "2" because I have no desire to ever play this again. There are some clever mechanisms in the game. Mainly the cathedral tiles section and how the position of your boat determines what you can do with a seal action. The game also plays quickly once you get started( *see annoyances).

But there are some really annoying aspects, too. The rules and mechanics take too long to explain for such a short game. There's just too much to go over. The board art is mostly dark and busy. The building spaces have no names on the board or the shield tokens, and some of the building illustrations have too-similar appearances at a glance.

Definitely will not be adding this to my collection.

Not a fan.  There is a lot of randomness from draw cards and pulling action tiles from the bag.  Although the action selection mechanic is innovative, I don't actually like it because often times a player will only have 1 or 2 choices of rows/columns to activate.  I also think the graphic design of the game board is not clear.

After three games. We thought the scoring was really luck-driven, especially with the high scoring cards, made of sets. We played 3 games with 2 players only and never managed to reach the end of the river with our boats... I guess it's doable (?) but to the detriment of scoring way more VP in various ways. I'd like to try it with 3 or 4, since the boat "jumping" seems like a mechanic that would let us go way farther down the river.

I was somewhat hopeful about this game as it looked to have some clever new ideas, and after playing it I'd say it seems to, but in play it felt a bit scripted. Usually of your twelve potential options many will either not be available because of a tile in the way or will give you actions that you can't use. So the tile draw determines to too large a degree what you can or should be doing for the turn. Also, I'd basically never play the "advanced" rules, as they seem to just further force you in one direction, mostly making one action better for the turn and thus forcing you to do it or not get the bonus. Disappointing.

RATING: 5
The heart of Ulm is in selecting your actions. There is a 3x3 grid of action tiles. Players draw a tile from a bag (there are 6 different actions) and slide the tile into a row or column of the grid, adding their drawn action to the two remaining in the row or column they pushed, defining their 3 actions for the turn. The board features the Danube, which players push their barge along, opening and closing "seal" action spaces on either side of the river. Besides moving their boat, players can collect coins to pay for seals, collect pushed-out action tiles to pay for action/scoring cards, or collect city coats-of-arms that give initial points and points whenever someone places a seal in the matching area of the city. Players can also collect cards that grant single-use in-game bonuses or can be laid face-up as an end game scoring goal. A number of areas and goal cards are assessed at the end and most points wins.

The action grid is effective without feeling terribly innovative. Everything is intertwined in true euro-fashion - you travel down the river to open up the seal action spaces which grant placement points to a player with the right city coat-of-arms. A big percentage of points seems to be in the cards and while you might be able to neglect some parts of the game, it seems impossible to win if you neglect cards. I didn't hate the game, but it just isn't special enough for me to come back to it.

RATING: 6
The central gimmick in Ulm is the action selection mechanism. There is a 3x3 grid of action tiles. On your turn you draw a random action tile and slide it into the grid. This will push an action tile out of the grid on the other side. Rows or columns that have been pushed in this manner already are not available for you to slide your tile into. The 3 action tiles inside the row or column you added your tile to are the actions you perform this turn.

I found that this system did not result in fun puzzle-like constraints, but instead in rather arbitrary ones. You aren't given tools to mitigate the random situations this system levels against you. For some this can still be fun and interesting. Those who like to be thrown into unknown circumstances and asked to make the best of it. I prefer more planning in games so for me this system doesn't sparkle.

The rest of the game is interesting enough although short on novelties. There is some set collection, brinkmanship, special powers, and player specific end game scoring options. It is not an unpleasant game and if the sound of the action selection doesn't bother you then I encourage you to try it out.

First impression
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
At the heart of Ulm is the original action selection matrix. Players draw one action tile from a bag and slide it into a 3x3 matrix of other action tiles. Then, the three actions (out of five different ones available) can be executed. Players move down the river, put their seals on buildings, purchase and play special cards and earn money and tiles to pay for these actions. Be prepared that players will take their time to decide on the wanted actions, their order and their individual execution. Luck plays a role in drawing the cards and can decide the game if a player going for the set collection cards doesn't draw the necessary third one to score relevant points.

The theme is generically medieval, the artwork is immediately recognizable as Menzel. Ulm is as euro as gaming gets, mostly tactical, an AP trap extraordinaire when players try to solve the action selection puzzle. In short, a solid game. The heaviest Burkhardt game so far.

RATING: 8
Old school euro with a cool puzzle for selecting your actions. Also the board is absolutely beautiful and remembers a little at the great time when everybody talked about the pillars of earth game. But where pillars of earth needed an expansion to please also the more experienced gamers Ulm has this already on board. It's more than a good family and for me one of this years highlights.

2017-02-10 - 5 - Apart from quite interesting action selection mechanism this game is just another eurogame, where you gain some victory points for unexcitingly doing whatever, not connected with anything pictured on the board or with theme. The game works, but there is so much more better games, that this one feels like a waste of time.

This is a newer title so will probably go up in the rankings, very clever action selection mechanism that makes for fairly quick turns. There's quite a bit of luck in the game, but part of the game is making sure you are prepared to take every action and thus mitigating the luck of the draw. This game rarely takes more than about 60 minutes which is nice for a light Euro.

Azt reméltem, hogy tetszeni fog, valami miatt úgy éreztem, ez egy izgalmas darab lesz. Összességében véve viszont átlag alattinak érzem, valahogy olyan furcsa mechanikai összeállítás az egész. Azért manapság olyasmivel már ritkán találkozni, hogy a tematikussággal kapcsolatban az erőfeszítés legkisebb jele sem érződik. Annyira nem könnyed, mint amennyire hosszú, és kimondottan sok a véletlenszerűség. A grafikai is egy kicsit csalódás, ráadásul szerintem a tábla elég nehezen átlátható. Részemről nem egy túl jól sikerült mechanikamix, viszont az akcióválasztós rész tetszik, jó lenne, ha az valami érdekesebb játékban visszaköszönne.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I'd play again but this isn't going to be something I need to own. The 3D cathedral where you stack the roof tiles up to build the steeple as a round counter is cute if a bit over the top! The rules are divided into two rule books which I generally find annoying since one has to keep going back and forth when learning the game. Additionally, I'm uncertain if I just couldn't find a rule or two or it wasn't quite clear - IE, when sliding in the 3x3 grid, do you push the outlying tile or just inside the 3x3 grid? There are definitely what appears to be several different approaches where one can score points and be competitive. The push the 3x3 grid row/column to determine your three actions for the round is interesting as is the fact that one can only place seals in areas where your ship is located...but you do want to push your ship forward to avoid losing points and there is a timing focus that may come into play there.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Ulm is a very interesting Euro game that doesn't play or feel like any Euro I've played before. After reading the confusing rulebooks (one rulebook contains the basic game mechanics, the other rulebook has appendices that explain the rest the game) I started playing the game with absolutely no idea what to expect. The experience was equally befuddling as it was brilliant.

I like the central mechanism: a 3x3 grid of action tiles where by sliding in an additional tile (taken blindly from a bag) you activate three actions. Actions vary from getting gold, grabbing tiles that are pushed out from the grid to pay for point scoring cards and moving your ship across the danube earning you points at the end of the game. Super interesting is that the position of your ship dictates which actions in the city of Ulm you can perform. When you ship has passed a certain city quarter, you can't do the actions in that quarter any more. Timing is everything in this game. The gameboard looks fantastic with great art by Michael Menzel. The action tiles are chunky and thick. The 3D Ulm cathedral used to track the round looks great. What I love most of all is how quick the game plays. Our first 3 player game lasted only an hour. Rounds fly by. I expect experienced players can play a 2 player game of Ulm in 30 - 45 minutes. Another big plus is an advanced variant with round by round objectives and bonusses. 

I do have some reservations. First of all, not all the components are that good. The 3D cathedral I mentioned above is flimsy and should be glued together. Card stock is poor. I sleeved my cards immediately. More importantly, resources in this game are quite scarce. Getting tiles to buy cards and money to place seals can be quite hard and frustrating. Some people have complained that this is a point salad game. I disagree. In one game I hardly earned any points for the first 7 rounds. In round 8, in one swoop I earned almost all my points for that game. This is certainly a slow burn kind of game. You seem to be planning ahead for one or two great rounds and that's pretty much it. 

I'm looking forward to more plays of this and see what I think of it after having played it more.

I really enjoy Ulm. The game does contain some luck (cards and action tiles drawn at random) but it also offers several ways to mitigate it. I like the fact that every turn feels like a little puzzle to solve. Ulm plays relatively quickly, and it never feels dull or repetitive as a result. For its playing time (around 60min), it's the perfect balance between luck and tactics.

Modern euro (low player interaction, somewhat point salad) with an old school euro feel (leisurely game play, easy rules). Likely best with two as you can plan more since the 3x3 grid does not change too much between turns.

Many will find the cards and coat of arms draws too swingy but I'm not sure that I agree. Let's just say you have to enjoy tactical, on the fly games, to enjoy Ulm. If you like a game like Bruges, you'll probably enjoy this one as well.

This is a fantastic strategy game, where you are working to influence the city of Ulm. The game features this really interesting action selection mechanism, where you draw a tile from a bag and push it into a grid, where you push the tile in determines which three actions you get this turn. You choose whichever order you want. This game has many different paths to victory, whether it's focusing on cards for scoring purposes, placing seals down in the city quarters, moving the boat up the river, you want to do it all and you can only do a portion of it. 

The game has two different ways you can play, one where every round plays out exactly the same, and one where something different happens every round, which can nudge you towards specific actions that turn. You always know what next round's event is so you have time to prepare.

The game works well, though differently with every player count, the more players there are, the more bogged down the tile grid will be, but at the same time the more easily you will move up the river and earn bonuses from players placing seals in your city quarters. I think three is the most optimal, but I would play any count myself.

the entire game seemed to be wrapped around the ok-ish tile selection mechanism.  Incredibly overwrought.  Very difficult to find answers in the rules for anything, and the board was so overdone it was very difficult to look at or aid in learning how to play.  Having everything in an almanac instead of a help card such as in Guilds of London seems a poor choice to me, as there is only on almanac and everybody has to sit around waiting for something to be looked up.

Ulm was not a game anywhere near my radar before I saw the Rahdo Run Through for it.  It was different enough so we tried it and it delivered.  It is a nice combination of euro and abstract game that plays quickly.  I am a fan of Forge War, so I don't mine having an abstract sewn into a euro game, but in Ulm it delivers that feel in around a third of the time.  The game looks good on the table and you will be in and out in under an hour once you get comfortable with how the game plays.

The game just keeps kicking you in the nuts, and resources are very tight all the time. The river system is brilliant: it dictates which actions are available to you but also screws you when you are forced to move faster than you'd like.

Game state is so dynamic that you cannot fully plan your turn in advance, so this is not very suitable for AP players. In any case, the "60 minutes" on the box is [i]very[/i] optimistic.

Mediocre graphic design: the board is just one big messy blob of brown, and both the board and all the other components are full of microscopic icons. The 3D cathedral is also very fiddly and obstructs the view.

The action selection mechanism is neat and refreshing. The game itself isn't that great. Cathedral cards are a joke, with 6VP if you play them as action. Also it is weir that the game seems to run against its limits in terms of growth soon (both in # of seals and river spaces) which forces you into a moderate pace on all fronts, which is weird.

Pros: plays fast, almost too fast, nice action mechanism, low price point, thick tiles. 
Cons: almost everything is random, many tiny icons to learn, card deck is the worst of the random elements, and too many cards. Huge point swings where you can easily pull 3 six point cards in a row, while the other player who spent 2 action tiles to pick two, discard one, still gets garbage. How did this get past playtesting? Very hard to get a set of three merchants or complete the cathedral. A little too open with only two players. No one ever used my crest areas. Board design is busy, mess of colors all blending together.  The cathedral standee is cute, but not necessary. 3 decks of cards in three languages also seems wasteful. Don't feel any accomplishment when winning; it's more like "I got lucky." Extremely gateway, casual, luckfest. 

Nowhere as interesting, or deep, as designers previous game, Seeland. Radho rating Ulm as one of the best games of 2016 proves he is losing it, or it was a bad year for games. I say both. Played twice, and sold.

Meh. I like the tile pushing mechanic but the actions are all completely underwhelming. Not much chance to build any strategy or plan ahead so each turn becomes a simple puzzle to make the most of the current gamestate. There are plenty of traps to fall into but little positive feedback or reward.

Ulm is a game with a unique action-selection mechanism. Players draw a random action tile from a bag, and then slide the tile onto a 3x3 grid of action tiles. They then get to use the three actions in the chosen row (not counting the tile that was bumped off). Actions include getting money, drawing special power cards, moving your boat down the track, or taking a board action. However, the board actions you can take correspond with how far your boat has advanced, so generally different actions are available earlier and later in the game. This definitely felt like a gimmick game with the action grid, but it seemed to work just fine. It was enjoyable enough, but I didn't find it too compelling.

A game I didn't know much about but was hearing good things. There is a cool pushing mechanic which reminds me of [thing=182116][/thing]. Ultimately, this game is a point salad race. Cant be a fair amount of push your luck. I got screwed early and was basically left in the dust for the rest of the game since I was unable to keep up with everyone and their actions. If you like Euro games you should probably try this if possible. It worked for many that had been playing it, it just didn't work for me or Ron. Probably not a game I will return to play.

RATING: 6
Interesting game, with a few potential problems.

The central mechanism is pretty cool. You slide a random tile where you want into a 3x3 grid of tiles, and the resulting line determines the actions you take. Stuff like gain money, buy a card, activate a space on the board, get tiles. You need to keep up everywhere.

I do wonder how much strategic choice there is. I don't think you can go for one thing, or skip something altogether. So everybody is doing a little bit of everything.

The first player has a big advantage. When every player is basically doing the same thing, the first player simply gets the best spots, and there's no way for the player last in turn order to improve their position.

The 4-player game felt like it was one or two turns too long. There wasn't really anything to do on the last turn, except draw a random card and hope it's one that's worth points.

Ulm felt like it could have been a great game. interesting action selection mechanism, players claiming areas so they get a benefit when someone else resolves an action... Unfortunately it fell flat mostly due to randomness.

Annoyingly, the rulebook is split across two books for no reason. This makes looking things up a challenge. Then, the basic mechanism of the game is, draw a tile, push it into a row, resolve the 3 central actions in any order of your row including the tile you pushed in. You start the game with 1 tile in your "supply"
one might imagine this means you draw a tile, add it to your hand, then choose a tile from your hand and push it in. Unfortunately, the rules state you must push in the tile you drew that turn, so  you get to know what 2 of your 3 actions are and the third is totally random. The tiles in your supply are used only for discarding to pay for the effect of, or to acquire cards. The cards when played have a choice of giving you an immediate effect or adding them to end of game scoring sets. Of course, getting and playing these cards requires some luck in terms of what tile effect you are able to activate.

One of the actions is a seal, which lets you place a marker either above or below your boat along the river. This is an interesting limitation on your actions, because you want to move the boat along the river, because that's where points are, but the further you go the more actions are no longer available to you. Here's the problem. The actions above and below the river are what get claimed by players. One of the river abilities is to randomly draw 2 location tiles keep one. About half of them are one and done score points, the other half let you claim locations. So maybe you draw the location that's at the start of the river late in the game when nobody can resolve that action anymore.

The game does have some luck mitigation. Most things are draw 2 keep 1 and there are ability tiles that can mitigate some of the luck. There are also sparrow tokens worth 1vp each if unspent, that can be spent to let you swap your draw with one from a faceup market display. The question is, how many times do you spend 1vp to swap your useless draw for an ok tile before the market is full of garbage and you are out of 1vp tiles?

Fast-playing euro with a neat action selection mechanism. Pushing the tiles is a great puzzle. There is a decent amount of luck in this game with the tile/card draws as well as the crest draws. There are ways to mitigate, but sparrows and pairs of tiles are hard to obtain. I think getting a lucky draw could get you pretty far ahead. Overall, it's a decent gateway level game that plays in an hour. Heard it was better with 3-4 players. Iconography is pretty complicated at first. Game also feels same-y after a while.

Interesting tile placement with a small bit of set collection going on. You play over 10 rounds, in each round drawing a random tile and pushing it on a 3x3 matrix such that you get to maximise the 3 actions available to you, at the right times. Cards provide an interesting way to score points too. Solid game.

Awesome medium weight Euro with some fresh mechanisms and zero theme lol. But it doesn't even matter since the crux of the gameplay is soo clever and fun. I got this game for $17 and it's one of the best purchases I've made to date. The production is amazing! I felt like the card draw could be super random and als quite devastating, if you allow other players to activate that action often. I want to explore this game further and investigate that part a little bit more.

Terrific little race down the river picking up points in this thematic little gem. The clever market system is a simple mechanism to give everyone three quick actions during their turn and after ten rounds it's over. Along the way you'll be positioning yourself and purchasing cards and using seals to take control of various parts of the city. It's been done before, but here it's elegant and done in a very thematic way. The church (the English rules incorrectly label the church a cathedral), sits near the middle of the board growing taller and marking the rounds with little turn by turn rules tweaks (in the advanced game), to mix things up.

Rules are very easy. Icons are too small for my eyes. Seems to plays best with three - with four it does play a little slow and we seem to get through the card deck and reach the end of the river a little too easily. First game with four took a tad over two hours. Second game with four took 65 minutes. Some games are like that.

The market system and the theme raise this a notch over the just good. The rulebook has a nice little history of the city - I like that. I've climbed the church and it's very impressive. Glad to see here's a game that does the city justice.

Played once with 4P. Günter Burkhardt certainly knows how to design interesting grid-based mechanisms. The concept of pushing rows to access actions is really quite fun. Having the pushed action tiles block rows and giving bonuses if rows are pushed onto players' seals helps flesh out the mechanism considerably. Using the grid does become more opportunistic with more players though, as the grid will change a lot in an entire round. 

The only minor complaint I have about the grid is that I encountered a situation whereby the grid was flush with seals but with only a coin or two. (The loading dock didn't help either.) I ended wasting seal actions because I didn't have the necessary cash, and it felt a bit frustrating to waste actions because the grid simply wasn't in my favour through no fault of my own.

Aesthetically speaking, the buildings on the very, [i]very[/i] brown game board don't stand out, and this causes problems when you're scanning the board for potential actions. The cathedral is also a nice feat of papercraft, but it doesn't serve any particularly crucial function. Instead, the tower tiles are shrunk down to microscopic sizes to fit into the structure. 

Gameplay-wise, the cards are also a bit of a bummer, given that they are fairly cumbersome to obtain. It's anticlimactic to draw into a card which just gives you 3VP because you don't have the correct set. So I'm not really digging the game built upon the cool mechanism which is the grid.

nice components for the price, one of the best deals I've ever seen in that regard; gameplay is simple and there is just enough going on in the game to keep things interesting for a decent play experience- however not sure the replay value is there, perhaps if there was a larger deck of cards with more ways to score and more engine building, and if the card action allowed choosing from a face-up row to reduce the randomness, the game could possibly be a little more enticing to want to play more than a few times

I thought the action selection mechanism was interesting, but the rest of the game was just okay. I thought the card draws were too random making set collection difficult and it seemed little could be done to mitigate that.

Overall some interesting aspects, but rather forgettable.

As somebody who doesn't care about theme and just likes good mechanics, I am surprised that I felt like I had no connection to any theme of this game. I don't even know why I am doing what I am doing, which is odd for me to say as I usually don't care.

The game feels like they came up with an interesting action selection gimmick and created a game around that, a game that does standard Euro stuff. I have enough "standard Euro" games. I won this game but honestly, it was just luck of what I happened to have when I happened to draw certain cards that I was able to take advantage of. I didn't out-play anyone, I just got lucky at the right times. Something I have no interest in.

Nice theme and interesting mechanics for this one. I have some initial concerns about game balance stemming from the huge gap in the usefulness of cards in the early game (some give resources and get your engine running while others are mainly end-game points and will cause a player unlucky enough to draw them to fall well behind) and especially the two overpowered ancestor abilities that get the owning players far more resources (either money or tiles) than everyone else. Need to play more to see how much of an edge these abilities really give. Regardless, a tight, smooth and enjoyable play experience.

Really mixed feelings about this one. I look at it and I see a really cool mechanism. I also see a game that allows you to take some actions and is forgiving even if you don't make the optimal choice. And my decisions were quick.  Problem is...my opponents didn't see it that way and the turns were way too long. I believe the game could take 90 minutes instead of close to 3 hours. With that said, I don't understand WHY on earth people love to play games with long decisions between turns. If I am going to do that, it's going to be two player (like chess). 4-player to me is sadistic. It's tough to say if I would do it again, but I really do like the design.

I'd never heard of this game before but Ron had good things to say about it.

What I thought was really interesting about the game was the action selection mechanism. You draw a tile from a bag, then place it on next to a tic-tac-toe grid of tiles and push one row or column with your tile. One of the tiles that was on the board is pushed off and your tile is now on. The three tiles in the row (or column) you pushed are the three actions you take. That row (or column) can't be pushed again until the tile that was pushed off has been removed. While I thought this was clever and neat, we ended up in situations where some of the action tiles didn't give you an action you could use. There's ways to pay "swift" tokens to switch one of the tiles from the loading dock with the tile you drew, but even then the action you need isn't always available. In the early game this meant I spent both my swift tiles and then ended up never seeing a money action until mid-game. Toward the end of the game (and admittedly we might have messed up and played too many rounds) nobody needed boat actions and the board was mostly boats.

The rest of the game wasn't as interesting as the action selection mechanism. Every round you could play a card. There were ways to build seals (spend two bucks to put your disc in a bonus spot that did something cool for you), move your boats... which you need to do to avoid negative points and get positive points (but which limits which seals you can build), take money (which was painfully tight), take the tiles around the edge of the board, or take a bonus card action (either play another card or pay tiles to draw a card (or two).

Being constrained on money in the early game meant I could only do one seal action in the early game. The different areas have different seal actions, but the one I did gave me a random choice to put my shield token in one of two areas (which would score points whenever someone put their seal in it). One of those two areas had already been built in and the other wasn't likely to have many builds in it... Other players got better options of where to place their shields.

Overall the game felt "clunky" as one of the players in our game called it. I wanted to like this game more than I did. I'd still like to see the action selection mechanism used somewhere else.

Ulm is a really interesting take on a lot of existing mechanics but serves them up in such a way that seems really fresh and unique. In addition to having somewhat deep strategic elements the game is relatively fast for a euro. We learned the rules and played the game in about an hour. While I definitely still prefer Feast for Odin and Hansa Teutonica this game definitely fills the niche of "Wanting to play a strategic euro game in an hour or less"

Very tactical, very random. Close to zero engine building. The type of game where there is no point in looking at the board unless it's your turn.

Oh and it seems balanced, but only because every major thing (cards or shields) you do is worth about 6 points.

Good medium-light weight euro game with a beautiful artwork. I really like the action selection system, it's very innovative. The gameplay is fast and smooth, but I do have some problems with it:

Firstly, I fear that there isn't that much replay value here, after a few games I feel like I'm going through pretty much the same motions with only slight variations.

Secondly, I'm not 100% sold on the event tiles from the advanced variant - yes, they introduce variety from round to round, but at the same time they guide you through the game and "tell you" what to do (or not to do). Worst of all, they put the last player at a significant disadvantage as he is left with very limited options to react when his turn arrives.

RATING: N/A
Euro programmed action placement to gain control of districts and complete long term set collection goals in a sixteenth century town in Germany.  Unique aspects include the assembly of a 3-D cathedral centerpiece serving as the countdown timer and display of the current round action modifier.  Area control of town districts is restricted by your prestige advancement player barges along the Danube river.  Programmed actions are managed by a sub game puzzle of pushing rows or columns of worker tokens from a pouch draw added to a grid.  Score bonus points when players use a controlled district or placement on the action grid.  Interesting dichotomy of strategy between short term district control and end game set collection scoring.  These 3D structures are popular lately and are OK for visual wow factor as long as they do not obscure important information on the game board from where players are seated--which is largely true in this case.

Interesting tile sliding mechanism but the rest of the game and rules quality are lacking.

Pleasant game, feels like a lighter version of [b]The Manhattan Project[/b].  I like the use and manipulation of the dice and how close you can keep the game.  Nothing really new, but good theme, and decent rules.

RATING: 4
A pretty simple game involving some light development, some calculation and dice.  Thematically it is good how the game obliges you to start with simple, short missions and work up to a climactic moon shot.  1969 is turn-based and gives players plenty to do on their turns, so down-time was certainly an issue with five players.  While there is plenty to be done, I'm not sure that the game offers a great many interesting choices and I could see it getting repetitive awfully quickly.   Other niggles are significant turn order advantages and those dice - development is largely about mitigating their effects, but they can still kill you.

Production quality and artwork are both good.

I feel a bit disappointed after the first play of 1969, it's not that the game is bad, but it is less than i expected. The seven turns look pretty much the same, there's some strategy to it but i see it mostly as an optimization game with a few must have technologies. I saw it in 2 players, an honest 7 with negative perspectives, i have the feeling that in 5 players it would take long and would be more luck dependent.

Played once, didn't convince me. First glance seems like there is a lot of stuff, but actually the mechanics are easy. There just is not enough to grab my attention and the whole game is just like a puff of american moon landing mission. Maybe for americans this game has more to give than for a finn who is not particularily interested in space.

Buying stuff each turn is sort-of interesting, but all the options feel too balanced. Then, the dice show up, and really overpower any decision making. An interesting style of game, where everyone builds up to the moon mission, but the forced "interaction" in the form of cards and spies seems like a bolted-on way of making the game more "interactive".

I liked this one pretty OK overall.  There's a little bit of engine building, a little money management, some risk management, some "take that" card play, and a healthy dose of luck of the die that all comes together to make a fun game.

There are quite a few various special abilities you can upgrade to throughout the game to diversify yourself from other players, which allow some experimenting with different paths to victory.  I worry that they may wear thin pretty quickly, but they will definitely keep the game fresh for a few plays.  The promos tile will definitely help with this as well, allowing for further diversification.

I'm also a little concerned that not enough dice are rolled in the game in order to account for a couple terrible rolls, which can actually have a big impact on scores since there really aren't that many rounds to score points.  The "take that" style card play definitely serves to rope in leaders as well, so I guess that mitigates a runaway leader concern where one player is getting a few stellar rolls.

Overall, everything comes together pretty nicely though.  Not a game I would want to play often, but one I'd be happy to play occasionally.

I think this one is going to be a purchase as it is a cool theme and works well. I'm just not a great fan of some of the rules in this one. Otherwise it has everything I like and it could get quite nasty as you sabotage each others missions. 1 Play.

RATING: 5
Based on 1 play with 4 players:

There's nothing BROKEN with this game, but nothing that grabbed me either. It's the same kind of bland race-to-points game you've played a million times.

The interaction is weak and dull. Ironically, the only mechanic that stood out to me as kind of cool is the Spy cubes - take up another player's scientist spot, counts as a space for you, AND gives them negative points? Neat! BUT I'm not a fan of games where the ONLY kind of interaction is a "take that!" kind of thing. And that's really all there is, apart from keeping tabs on what other people are building up while you're deciding what to go for.

And I am actually a fan of a good multiplayer solitaire game. As long as the race to VPs has sufficiently interesting choices  I am down like a clown... in crazy rainbow afro town... for the race. To me, there's a satisfaction in trying to do a thing really well and then comparing to how well my friends did their things and feeling like I'm smart because I did my thing better. But this just isn't interesting. Buy some dudes, put them on a spot, roll some dice. Yawn.

Passssssssss.

The rules might seem complicated, but once you play one round you got it. The hard part is the frustration in failed missions. But you'd be amazed at how will you do later on in the game even though the game rounds go by pretty quickly. My tactics are to save money and to benefit from failed missions somehow.

Tested it in Essen. Normally, the space theme appeals to me greatly. 1969 was a big disappointment however.

First thing that struck us odd was that already in round two, players sitting further from the starting player had a disadvantage, as no "virgin" cheap missions were available any more. This was not at all compensated.

Secondly, there is too much luck involved. 5 dice determine your mission success. One from our party managed to have a complete mission failure despite the possibility to re-roll dice and turn one neutral to success.

On top, you randomly pick cards with value from 1-3 with which the random dice roll could be modified.

As the final mission to the moon would greatly be dependent on the success in previous missions, we had the feeling of an unsatisfactory game and we quit half-way through.

Good that we tested it, otherwise I might have bought it :(

Worker placement, with dice rolling and classic NASA theme.   What could go wrong?   As it turns out, not much.   My first game was a 5 player, and everyone had a 'blast'.   Dice rolls are just like real launches, you don't know how the mission will go, and that's the fun of it.   As you progress towards 1969, luck starts to become less of a factor, but watch out for spies.

RATING: 5
Players represent countries, competing in the Space Race, from 1963 to 1969.  Each turn, players receive some income, which they invest into scientists, technology cards, and mission launches.  Scientists are allocated to roles for the game, that give the players special abilities, or grant success results during missions.  Missions are resolved by rolling five dice and totally successes, and successes allow progress up the mission track.  Further up the mission tracks, the more victory points you receive, and possibly a bonus advance on the lunar landing mission on the final turn of the game.  Solid game, more a business/money management game than a space simulation (this is one of those "could be any theme" games, but is actually well applied here).  The rules give the impression this is a simple gateway game, but there is a fair bit of thinking to do here, and you can't let one player get out to a lead.  Not spectacular, but not terrible either.

A really excellent game that I have always been interested in because of the theme. 
On reading the rules I thought that the cards might be annoying because you can mess over other people with them, but the whole this works nicely.

It is now on my wishlist. *update* I now own it.

It is a game that every time I play it I discover more things that I want to explore on my next play. Very compelling

This game has several issues:

1. Poor luck vs. strategy balance
I'm a big fan of Kimgsburg and Alien Frontiers so,I don't mind luck in games at all, but here then result of a really bad roll can be severe and not easily be mitigated.

2. Poor turn order balance
Going last sucks for several reasons.  Using tracks which are already occuppied lets you lose points and you are in bigger danger that other players will burn their unused cards on you.

3. Kingmaking
Attacking other players with cards, especially on the last turn, can easily decide who wins and who loses.  All in all, I find the overall end game handling pretty much dissappointing.

4. Pasted on theme
Instead of going to the moon, this game is really not much more than the usual cube-shuffling.

I like the theme but apart from that it's a deeply flawed game.

It's all so symmetric and overly balanced that it doesn't seem to matter much what you do. Also there is so little variety that once someone works out the optimal strategy, everyone will just do the same thing and there is no reason for anyone to deviate from that. To top it off, the interaction is very minimal and of the very plain "take that" variety.

While I did enjoy the first game, I can't see any replayability whatsoever.

Most of the fun we had with this game revolved around jokes about minor powers (Canada) having space programs, and the kind of crude puns you can expect to come up when building a rocket program. Oh, and those blue scientists who look like jocks. Balance didn't seem to work well, luck seemed to play too much of a role, and there seemed likely to be an optimal strategy which, once found, wouldn't vary much.

After one game I played with 3 other guys I can say I'm not really enthusiastic about the game. I think this might become one must-buy "entry" game for players who are getting in touch with "more complex" games for sure since it has no in-game text and illustration are pretty self-explainatory but its general depht is really limited. After 3 turns of play I had the feeling to be "imprisoned" in a repetitive cycle with no escape. I didn't like at all the card system, seeing it as the simplest way to avoid players from summing up and counting opponents' resources for launch tests. Maybe a more complex card system could improve the general depth of the game.
To sum up: not bad to introduce people to boardgames but nothing more.

Love the theme, but this was probably my least favorite game of BGG.Con. This is basically a tech track development game where you use the tech to give you die roll bonuses to gain points. The tech track, however, is uninteresting. Also there's a card based take that mechanism that is completely unwelcome.

RATING: 5
In space, no one can hear you scream, or mutter uncontrollably about the wonky endgame. This left me a bit cold. I find it problematic that turn order, which you have no control over whatsoever, plays such a big part in the last turn - basically, if you happen to be going first that turn, no one is likely to stop you from getting back to earth because they have to hang onto cards as a hedge against someone stopping them. So the player who's first in turn order in the last round just decides who to torpedo and has no real incentive not to. Long story short, whomever is going last in the last round is fucked.

There might be a fix - you get five points for each set of two or three cards in the same denomination, or something, I dunno - but it's a serious flaw in the game. The assumption that that player is somehow disadvantaged in the rest of the game is dependent on the number of players. It's possible that we played it wrong or missed a rule, but that seemed like enough of an issue for me to kind of dread playing it again.

And don't even get me started on the Canadian space program. What's the exit velocity from Nunavut, just curious?

Anyway, other than that it's fun enough but a bit spreadsheety. The game I played was won by the player with the most prestige (green) scientists. I don't know quite how he afforded it but it clearly had something to do with good planning. 

Next!

Won through BGG contest.  Here, trying to find something nice to say about the game. 

I want to say something nice but this thing went the way of MOO3, a good attempt but more an exercise and not a game.  This one falls short of the moon, and I am sorry to see it that way. With the apollo and liberty bell programs each mission was required to make the next mission after that possible:  docking , matching speed, spacewalks, extended stays in space.  I realize there was some spying in terms of technologies, but the game is more about sabotage than the rigors of trying to put stuff outside the atmosphere. 

The game just didn't work for me in that it felt too dry, lots of attempts, but not working out. 

Tried tinkering with the rules to make it playable but just couldn't find a way.

Good components, sleek gameplay, good graphic design.

The game plays the last seven years of the 60's. Each year you hire scientists to either help you get your space program going or do actual scientific work that raises your chances of succeeding in missions. You also get to launch one mission per year, to gain international fame (you guessed it: victory points) and prepare for the big one, the mission to the moon. You *could* push for the moon the very first year, but your chances are minimal to non-existent. The good stuff.
Espionage and counter-espionage regularly decide upon the success of a mission and allow you to hamper your opponents space program while boosting your own. The country with the biggest international prestige at the end of 1969 wins. Something to achieve without a successfull moon mission is almost impossible.

The funky details and winks to in retrospective silly political and cultural phenomena let this game shine.

RATING: 4
Got the game to the table, and all 5 of us had fun. But in the end 1969 left us all a little cold. The game is a typical Cranio Creation: Out of the ordinary, some very interesting concepts, and an unusual theme - All good reasons for buying it.

But it doesn't really strike its theme the way I'd like it to do it, and in the end the player with the best HR department won, mostly by having used all its spare cash to buy espionage cards, to a degree where actual technical accomplishments became secondary. The nation with the best stepping stone technologically before the moonshot itself finished last, because no more spy cards could be bought.

This might all change in a 4 or 3 player game - but in the 5 player game, scientists ran out, and then all there was left were the spy cards, which then also ran out.

Cranio: I love where your odd ideas take you (and I adore Horse Fever), but this rocket didn't fly very far.

When I started playing I though: "gosh - this could just have had ANY theme", just a bunch of smaller races with neat ideas until you feel strong enough for the big race at the end ... but in play the table talk spun around exploded rockets, stupid scientists, and the under financed space program. So something must have clicked here.

This game has no feel for the space race at all, and the theme is only a veneer for a standard Euro, albeit one with a horrible end game where the player order certainly determines who gets screwed.

The theme and use of scientists works well and so do the mechanics upto a point. The advantage of going early in the turn order sequence in any round is huge - you get the first choice of the limited supply of remaining scientists. So going last in the first round may mean you cannot get as much cheap labour as you would like. Whereas going last in the last round WILL mean everyonelays all their cards against you! Whilst the last round problem could easily be fixed by awarding 1 prestige point per card held at game end, the issue with earlier rounds is more fundamental.
Maybe more play testing would have helped?

Rating reflects the fun factor on the first try. The game probably won't have much staying power because the tech tree is so simple that the opening moves are likely to converge towards a single path. Most likely maximizing buying bonuses and spying the hell out of the opponents. 

There's also a significant advantage for players earlier in the turn order (especially for taking missions and using spies), and this is not compensated in any way, neither is there a way to manipulate the turn order.

Attracted by the theme and the idea of building up resources to shoot for the moon outdoing everyone else.  Yet when we played, players all seemed to be taking similar actions with the result that the end result depended on the die roll rather than any skill or combination from the player.

Yes, there are different scientists with different costs and benefits, but they don't seem to matter that much.  There might be subtlety in play somewhere, but fear the game isn't compelling enough to attract the plays to discover it.  Probably a fun filler once a year at best.

Great theme, terrible implementation. This is a pretty vanilla worker placement game without much interesting going on. There is an awful lot of direct attacks that are possible on other players, both sabotaging their research and their missions. Getting extra cards and discounts on new scientists is key, and so those decisions are straightforward, and spies will quickly fill in those locations, meaning that if you are target of those attacks, you have little opportunity to win. I do like that you perform smaller missions and research on simpler tasks in order to build up to the moonshot, but the rest of the gameplay makes me not want to ever play this again.

Pasted on theme, which is really disappointing since the theme hasn't been beat to death. Die rolling with a strategy game never works for me. There are things in there to manage the randomness, but you can't eliminate it and winning based on a crazy die roll doesn't feel like an accomplishment or losing based on a crazy doe roll makes you feel like you're robbed. After playing it I'm glad I didn't pre order it.

I love all things Space Race, so this was a game I was really looking forward to. Ultimately I'm a bit disappointed, as the final game is a bit too light and random for me. You buy scientists, upgrade rocket parts, then go on a space mission each turn. But as much as you can try and work around it, if you roll red on your 5 dice instead of green, you're failing your missions and losing the game.

Also, there's quite a bit more kingmaking and metagaming than I like. Players collect "spy cards", and can use them to sabotage another player's mission after he's successfully rolled the dice. This is especially bad in the final round, as the game winner can come down to who the players decide to sabotage and who they don't. Player 1 was successful, will he probably win? If so, play your negative cards. But now you don't have any more cards, and player 2 wins if he's successful on his rolls. Or, you save your cards thinking player 2 is the bigger threat, but player 2 doesn't make his roll anyway, so you should have used your cards on player 1.

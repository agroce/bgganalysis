I bought this game because I like Roundel games and this game has a Roundel for each player which seemed different.  I expected the game to be very solitaire (which I like) and I did not have high hopes for having a fun factor.  I expected it to be bland and ok.  I have played twice so far and hope to get a few more games in this weekend.  It was surprisingly good.

The random worker tiles adds re-playability.  The main board is critical to time just right and watching where people are with their Roundels and resources is key in scoring a few points higher on a given play.  Having to constantly change your resource engine due to the Castle tax was AWESOME!  It was stressful in a fun way of how to keep fixing the workers in order to get the right resources to perfectly time the right building type (road, market, house).

A well-polished new game.  It has a novel "build-your-rondel" feature that presents some really interesting choices.  The "destroy-part-of-your-rondel" mechanic is brilliant.  I like the balancing act.  I ding it a bit for having a really uneven flow.  It can go really fast or really slow, depending on what you have available on your turn.  ([b]Dominion[/b] has the same issue.)

After the first game with three: I really like this game. The options are not that difficult, but there are several possible strategies. You always create good situation for your fellow players, but that is the design of the board.
The micro turns are sometimes a bit "soulless" - especially while moving on the upper half of the board - but on the other hand speeds this the game up.
Nothing too special, but makes fun and has an unique mechanism with building the rondell for yourself.

Light eurogame with simple rules. I like some of the mechanics like the personal rondel, the engine building aspect, and the fact that after each full circle you have to discard a part of it. On the other hand, I found the road building part of the game (on the main board) too mathy and unexciting, making the game feel abstract.

Lovely swift-playing game with a fresh combination of mechanics. Component quality is good, with the exception of the too-thin player boards. Most turns are very swift (over in seconds), though every so often the game stalls a bit when a previous player's move causes someone to need to re-evaluate possibilities. 
My rating has shifted down by half a point from my initial impression, as I've discovered that several building strategies are highly dependent on what other players are doing on the board, but the mix of available workers can really screw you over with not making others viable. 
I'll probably reduce the rating further in the future, as I just can't get excited about playing this anymore.

It has a very interesting system to force you to optimize each and every turn through the payment of very strong taxes.  Some very good ideas, but the main expnasion board may be quite chaotic with 3-4 players, needing really too much adaptation, which is not easy.  Very nice components.

First Play: Offer to explain game came from Martin at Epsom Gamers. The rules are quite simple but having said that I seemed to get them wrong repeatedly. This is almost a filler but there is alot to consider. Certainly its crucial to buy in new labour early doors to create an efficient engine. As a result there will be a huge difference in performance between the first and second games.

A solid 7.5, but marginal whether I like it enough to buy it.

Played this game last night twice 4 players. It was very very good. We all had a blast. The changing individual rondels are unique and cool. The scoring opportunities are tactical and even a little bit of chicken here and there not wanting to score 4 and open up a 7 or 8 for someone else. I want to play again soon.

RATING: 5.5
A light/medium weight, abstract, economic game.  It's rather challenging because money and resources are right and you must sacrifice income frequently (either through covering old workers with new ones or through mandatory donation of a worker to the king each time you loop around your player board).  Overall, the game is very dry and abstract, and I don't like the feel of the road/market/trading post construction and points payouts.  There are too many restrictions on building these items and too few valuable places to build, resulting in some players earning lots of points rather arbitrarily.

7-5 2012 Interest: Low.  Looks like a high player interaction tile laying, network building, game.  However, the designer's previous offerings drops this to Low Interest.  

7-18 The rules just came out and it looks interesting.  Unfortunately, the only review is negative.  It looks like the only itneraction is on the main board.  Here's my take on it:
1. Streets set up scoring opportunities (and give you some points)
2. You can build houses in the triangles of streets for points.
4. You can build markets on the corners of triangles for some points, to later place wheat for points, and to branch roads off.

Setting up your worker board is key to set up efficient scoring opportunities.  Plus you may need to change the worker board around as the game progresses to get better scoring opportunities.  

On paper it looks like it's got a lot going on.  The shared/solo boards remind me of Walnut Grove (which I still haven't played).  I still think I want to give this a try.

I wasn't impressed by this game. It felt repetitive with the rondel and the scoring. On top of that, there's a good amount of AP from scoring and placing, not wanting to set another player up. The mechanics do work for this light Euro, in the end it's a visually appealing game but nothing exciting.

Slightly New take on Rondel mechanic.  Travel around your player board, first using workers (tile placement) to gather resources.  Then visit the market to hire more workers and buy & sell resources.  At the workshop and mill, spend most (if not all) resources to produce roads, markets, houses & flour sacks before reaching the castle.  Placement on the board, of said objects, can be planned to strategically maximize points and obtain bonus tokens.  Tax at round's end removes one worker and reduces resources to 3, for carrying over to next turn around your player board.
Heavy AP for those so inclined.  Theme is thin, but play is FUN.

RATING: 5
Milestones appeared to me at first about creating incentive structures on a shared board, usually a dependable mechanism. A first trial game I messed up considerably by not looking at that shared board properly: instead of claiming good spots for myself, I only opened them up for the other players. I lost without quarter. In a rematch things went a lot better; and I realised, somewhat sadly, that Milestones [i]isn't[/i] about incentive structures, but simply about relentless min-maxing using a private resource engine which has to be made to operate as smoothly as possible. While there are several ways to set up that engine there isn't much variety in the game to support many repeat plays: the differences are truly very small as the number of resource tiles on one's tableau is limited by a lack of space. You can have at most four there; or at least one. That's it. An extra bit of much-needed variation is offered by a majority count of all five resource-producing workers on everyone's tableaux: this introduces subtle jockeying in how the final turns play out, definitely a Good Thing, and which saved the game from a lower rate than what I gave it.

I guess I appreciate the authors' desire to create a very clean game, but at the same time I fear it has been made too clean, and that a lot of potentially interesting decisions have been culled along the way. As a result I no longer search for a copy, and am content to have made the game's acquaintance to the level that I did. I will join in if asked, though.

Tile Placement
Players work together to build roads, create marketplaces, and erect houses. With each milestone set along the way, they move further into the country.
But while they build together, when it comes to procuring construction materials, money, and grain each player is on his own. Thus, you must carefully develop your own network of goods, trade and colonization materials and optimize its use cleverly. Whoever also develops a keen sense of timing can grab the most valuable building sites and in the end win out.

Milestones is a resource-collection and convert-to-building stuff game of light-medium weight. Similar to games like Walnut grove, there is a tile placement aspect as well as movement of workers around a circle to conduct various actions (only this time each player has his own board and cannot be blocked). Nothing too spectacular here, but certainly not a dull game either. I actually like this one better than Walnut Grove, as you can pace yourself a little better with regard to your actions. Nevertheless, it didn't leave a great impression on me.

The worker tile mechanic is really nice, as there is restricted space into which to play the tiles, regular 'sacrificing' of workers and there is a bonus for them being in ascending order, however a single clever mechanic doesn't make a game.

These workers make up the majority of your personal rondel and the remaining 4 spaces are taken up by the 'castle' at which you have to stop and sacrifice a worker, a building space which allows you to build the milestones the game is named after, a mill allowing you to effectively upgrade resources (and score more points) and the buy workers/coins/resources space.

The very limited 3 resources maximum after you pass the castle prevents hoarding of resources and forces players to build throughout the game but placement of the built components felt quite limited (and as a side note the houses should have been a different colour to the milestones and roads as they tend to get a little lost)

Although the board is shared by all the players there is very little player interaction and it feels very 'multiplayer solitaire' and there is little to nothing you can do to stop a run away leader.

Overall the actions are very mediocre and the gameplay it not very engaging and a little repetitive, I will give this another go but I am not rushing to get it to the table again.

One of the few games where a personal board doesn't make for a solitaire game. (Ralf zur Lind excels at avoiding that, IMHO). 
Where someone else has built directly affects where you can build, and where they are on their rondel may influence your decision about what to do.

Kb két év után újra előkerült. Az a baj, hogy nincs semmi izgalmas ebben a játékban. Pedig az alapmechanizmusok kecsegtetőek lennének, de valahogy annyira ki van a lényegi döntési rész egyensúlyozva, hogy nincs súlya a lépéseknek. A játék végi 1-1 pont különbség sokkal inkább azon múlik, hogy az előtted ülők, milyen lehetőséget kapartak ki neked, semmint a saját döntéseiden.

In Milestones, each player has his own private rondel which isn't much different from the more common case of one rondel shared by all players, except for one thing: Players can customise their own rondel to some extent. This is, in fact, the most important part of the game. As you might guess it also means that the game is a fairly solitary affair with everybody just puttering about on their own board.

The game tries to alleviate that by having all players build a network of roads on a shared board. This is where you actually score points, and at first glance might seem like a proper fix. However, while the game is very susceptible to player order in that the next player can profit hugely if you leave the door open, I believe this is mostly a problem of being new to the game. As soon as everyone has understood not to present great opportunities to the next player it revolves almost entirely about your own rondel. The shared board becomes largely irrelevant.

While I love some of Stefan Dorra's designs, this was a total bust. It's a themeless and fairly obvious placement game where you're simply trying to occupy the high-scoring spots. Problem is, you're entirely dependent on your right-hand neighbour to leave you a scoring opportunity and since high scores are possible on roughly alternate turns you can be totally screwed. For example: the first to build must build a road that will score just 2 points. That leaves a better opportunity for whoever builds second, so no-one wants to build first etc. There's also no catchup mechanism. Ghastly mechanical dreck.

Possibly require more plays but wasn't blown away here.  Interesting spin on resource generation, with the player board containing a loop of actions.  The workers that generate resources slowly get replaced with new ones, meaning your 'engine' must change constantly throughout the game.

There can be some downtime with this one, and it can be frustrating when the available worker tiles aren't useful.  This isn't a bad game by any standard, but there's much better games of this style out there.

After 1 play:

I think I emphasized too much on getting multiple items on a move instead of diversifying my initial setup. It takes 4 resources to exchange for one resource that you want so that is not very efficient. I ended up with lots of sand and a occasional stone so mostly I built roads which doesn't score well. I think it works better to slow play the resources and build a lot in one turn instead of whipping around the rondel.

I think this is a cool game and I certainly would like to play again.

Got a chance to play this at Gencon twice - both times with 4 players.  We found out later that I had one minor rule wrong (we were too restrictive on when you could pick up the bonus tiles.)

I enjoyed the "build your own roundel" aspect of the game and that mechanic is pretty fresh and unusual.  The board play is interesting too but you have to watch for setting up the person on your left.  That part seems to come from the Dorra influence in the design.

I'm definitely preordering as a result of the plays @ Gencon.  Nice game that is over in about an hour.

The rondel used in Milestones is great idea and the game mechanisms forces to use your resources fast and effectively. And I really like the worker-part here as well. Even the gameplay goes fast so there are very little downtime.

Stefan Dorra is a good designer. I'm not sure he can be called "great" but he's designed quite many good (old-fashioned, so not very complex and not overly long) Eurogames that don't change the world but are very good additions to sub-genres defined by other games - his design style definitely fits mine. And he's recently teamed up with Ralf Zur Linde, designer of the tricky game Finca which felt 'not bad' after the first play but has grown on me in a few plays and now is a secret favorite.

Milestones evokes the feel of Dorra games and Finca at the same time (and this way I consider it a better work of collaboration than Pergamon). I can't really put my finger on why it feels like Finca (there aren't really common mechanism elements here), but just like there, it's a game where short-term planning is more important than long-term; you have a rondel-like mechanism where first you collect different colored resources (with the never obvious decision - should I collect a lot of one type or 1-1 of different types?) then you "deliver" them - exchange them into points on a map, jumping on new possibilities created by others or cursing them for taking away the best scoring possibilities; finally you even get 5 points for majorities on your tiles. Okay, the comparison is a bit forced but the feel is somehow the same. I believe it has the potential to get a lot better after some repeated play.

Why haven't more people discovered this game yet? It really is a fast-paced, fun and thoughtful game of opportunism crossed with continual engine-building. You've got to be on top of the game every single turn or the revolving door of workers will screw you up for a round or two, meaning you'll likely miss a juicy point-grab on the board.
The personal rondel is clever and unique. Excellent stuff.

Yes, this is another "collect resources and build stuff for victory points" Euro game. Obtain workers and build a road network - been there, done that too. There's *absolutely* nothing new here. The game is all tactical (which is fine); I saw no way to have a strategic plan. You just had to go with the flow and try to capitalize on what others did, and strike while the iron was hot to make the most points. Every game can't be groundbreaking. Yet with countless dozens of Euros that do the same thing, only better, merely being "OK" is not good enough to make me want to play it again.

This is an interesting game, where you are moving your piece rondel style around a board, activating workers, hiring workers and trading goods and money in order to build into a communal board.

The really interesting part is managing the order of the workers you hire, as it can really affect the number of resources you might get when stopping at a specific worker, and it might earn you bonus money if you manage to keep them in an ascending order. This can become tricky as the kick will require one of your workers as tribute each time you pass through the castle, so your work force will constantly change.

The building onto the communal board is mainly just a scoring mechanic, but it's interesting finding ways to steer roads in such a way that you don't give your opponents too good scoring opportunities with their own builds, as there are specific rules on where you can build out of.

All in all a neat game.

A clever euro-game where your board is kind of a rondel that you can take as many steps on as you want with the caveat that you have to pay for your progress each time you lap.

Arguably a rondel game with individual player rondels instead of a common one, with each rondel constantly changing a little bit at a time.

The idea for the personal rondel, and the entire process of manipulating the resource production tiles, is really clever but unfortunately the rest of the game is terribly boring and repetitive. There's an insane amount of calculation which ultimately produces no real rewards: Figuring out what to produce and trade, and staring at the main board in order to decide what and where to build, only to gain a single VP more from the building actions.

I did not find the castle or the end scoring to be problematic at all, it's just all the stuff happening on the main board that's terribly uninteresting.

It blends a point salad approach with personal economies which I thought added something. You choose which resource generators to keep and maintain on your board, and each time you cycle around your board you can choose to go slowly and let each worker generate, or go faster and get those you absolutely need this turn so as to get to your build steps faster (but with fewer resources). So each player chooses their own pace - how many turns do you spend collecting resources before you do your build step. Building is just different variations of cubes to build different types of buildings for different ways of scoring VPs, and not worth going into. And there are options to turn 2 into 1 and the like. After each building phase, you need to cover up a worker, so it's important to keep generating gold to generate more workers as well. To that end it's fair to decry it as a standard Euro, and it is, but I thought the idea behind the personal boards added a nice touch of interest.

Fun Med-Light Route-Building Rondel Resource-Management Game. Good feel to this one. Not quite a tile game. Not quite a worker placement game. Okay artwork and graphics. The road map board feels a little abstractish, but the individual rondel player boards are half of the game. Easy to learn and teach. If everyone knows the game, it can be a good time under an hour.

Good 2 player, but better with more people.

This is an excellent and underrated Stefan Dorra title!  It's all about efficiency, building up your worker/resource engine, and knowing when and where to jump to on the action selection rondel.  You gain resources and activate building actions when visiting workers and locations on the rondel.  Love it!  Each time you visit the castle though, you must cover up one of your workers.  So you're always having to adjust and work your strategy.  And then the main game board is abstract a bit.  This is where you build roads, houses, and marketplaces for points.  Competing with everyone for the best spots!  Very good, and very approachable.  Easy to teach and understand, but plenty to think about each turn.  Excellent!

In this game, players had player board that featured a rondel on which a player could move his pawn as far as he wanted, but had to stop in a penalty spot (a lot like Walnut Grove). The interesting thing here is that you buy action space tiles to put on your rondel that you can stop on and collect resources; if you pass by a spot that produces the same resource as the one you land on, you also collect that resource. The penalty space forces you to "retire" a spot, but you can build over it on a later turn. The resources are used to extend a common road network, placing over various spots on the board that give you points. I found this one to be very dry and not particularly exciting.

In this game, you get a little meeple who circles your board like a roundel. At the top row, you place production tiles, and in the bottom row there are action spots that turn the resources into elements on the central board thereby scoring for their placement. The trick is, you get bonuses for lining up production spots of the same type close to each other, and for lining up the numbers printed on those spots in order. You guy to make this little production engine, and then that engine gets slowly eaten away at the starting space, which removes one of your production tiles each full rotation. Clever, but not much replayability. While the roundel aspect is really cool, the central board is sort of mathy and dull. I'd be interested in a game where you do a similar personal roundel, but then do something more exciting with the result.

Interesting game that can be a bit of a brain burner. You have to be very careful about what and where you build and keep an eye on what the other players are about to do, otherwise you will give points to opponents. Huge potential for AP. The best way to play is to just go with your first hunch and not try and calculate every possibility.  

Components are very good except the player boards are thin and mine tended to curl up on the ends, and even though I kept gently bending them they still did this. I took them to Kinko's and had them mounted on heavier stock. They look fabulous. I also wish the houses were not black, there is too much black with the roads and milestones being black as well. But this is nit picking. 

Over all this is a really fun game and perhaps a bit underrated. I really like the building mechanic and the different ways to score points with the roads, houses, market places, and flour sacks. The placement and management of workers  on the individual player boards makes for a lot of interesting decisions to make. If you enjoy engine building and if you enjoy building different things for victory points then this game is for you.  I very much recommend it.

There's a strong network/spatial element and you have to keep an eye on what moves are available to other players, both in terms of the network and by watching what resources they have and where they are on their "rondel" -- timing can be important.

This is a very abstract game where players take actions by collecting cubes on their own personal asynchronous rondels.  Those cubes are then turned into "fences", "houses", and "markets". on a main board.  I put those words in quotes because it really is purely an abstract and the little shapes we put on this board along these triangular lines could be anything.

There is a lot of strategy to consider on where you place these abstracted structures, like any other abstract game.  You want to get the most points but you need to take care that you don't set your opponents up to score high either.

The personal rondels are kind of interesting.  Each turn players can make two stops on action spaces and skip any number of spots along the way.  Like a mini Francis Drake.  Also, each full rotation you are required to stop on a space that lowers your resource cache to 3 items and forces you to cover up an action space.  This is a pretty interesting mechanism since you are forced to spend all but 3 of your resources each turn and also frequently buy new action spaces to replace the ones lost.  It also occurs to me that if you aren't paying attention you can end up completely locked out of the game if too many action spaces are covered.

In the end though I'm not an abstract guy and this game isn't really for me.  The rondels are kind of interesting but I'd rather see them in a game a little better than transforming 3 colors of cubes into abstract wooden discs for points on a lined grid.

It is a bit overwhelming to learn, and I don't think it quite pays off, how complicated it is to learn (not to play) and how much fun it is. That being said I think some of he mechanics are so interesting and unique that I am happy to have it in my collection. I don't love it but I like it. Not sure I would want to play it with 4 players though, it is a bit solitary with a bit of downtime for the others when a player goes through his/ her moves; more of 2-3 player game imho.

Not my cup of tea. Cube collection, then conversion into buildings for VPs or more collection resources, repeat on a personal rondel. Somehow put me in mind of 'Welcome to Walnut Grove' (which I dislike), with a little more interaction. Some interesting timing issues around fast/slow rondel circuits , the retirement of workers and trying to leach off other players building, think 'Inca Empire/Tahuantinsuyu' but much less engaging overall.

The'cant 'get past the castle' with more than 3 goods feels like a  fix to stop hoarding and to force players to build stuff on the board. This  is not a bad game, it just felt very dry. Traded.

Looked more promising than it played. There's a "wash-rinse-repeat" sequence feel, where players can pick up two types of resources, go spend them, then return to the castle to start all over again. OK, there's a bit more going on with the natural wastage of resource-producers, but it just felt like an exercise in ramping up production then depleting production as you coasted towards game end.

Easy to play but intriguing. You need to build up your people for income, but must contend with losing them on a regular basis. You can set up people to get a lot of one income type quickly, but that will mean you lose people faster.

This game was released a couple of Essens ago and never really took off. It looks nice, it has nice components and the rulebook is of family strategy depth and it was co-designed by [person=13][/person].
The game is indeed of the family strategy kind. But it does offer some wonderfully painful decisions. Each time you move over the production characters, you have to decide to stop at each one and go slow, or go faster, skipping some but gaining more of another kind. Each round you also have chose one character to cover up, forcing you to invest in new ones regularly. Yep, this game works very well, but it does indeed fail to stand out.

Milestones is a board game, which puts you inside a new city, trying to become a market crossroad for local citizens and travellers. And you have only one simple task – to build. Roads, houses, milestones, but also a minor marketplaces on the crossroads, so people have their groceries closer to their homes. You run it from distance, because the main arranging and work is to be done in the city. You run around the town, hire workers and with their help mine and grow materials to build everything and supply marketplaces. But the city has a ruler, who is constantly collecting taxes and driving your workers away to duty in his castle. You have to deal with fate and collect as many points as possible for the roads and houses bulit. Every crossroad has a number on it, which suggests number of points, you can gain there – in several possible ways and even more than one time. This road is built in joint efforts, so any of your enemies might snatch the points before you do. Moreover you have only two moves during each turn and while trying to visit some places, you have to jump over another and resign on their profits. Its only up to you, which one would you prefer. Castle guarantees, that each match will flow directly forward in constant pace, because players are forced to spend their materials right away. Unfortunately, there is little interaction in the whole game and each player is fiddling with his own board. The only interesting element (except building roads together) is dominance of workers, but that happens only in the end of the game, so you will pay attention to it few rounds before it. Also the components have a limited number of colors and some of them share the same shade, so the whole game is less transparent. But across all these minor complaints, Milestones is still a nice strategic game with a lot of interesting paths to victory, with much planning on the way.

I had been interested in this game a while back. Even to the point of buying the game, though I traded it away without playing it. The art makes this seem a little family-ish.

The game is about gathering and spending resources to build a networks of roads, temples and houses across the board (which score points in different ways depending on what you build). The board is laid out with point values which will dictate how each thing scores by the relevant numbers it is adjacent to.

There are worker tiles at the top of your player board. On your turn you move your marker any number of spaces forward. Whatever resource worker you land on determines what you get, with the number of that type of workers you passed (including the one you land on) determining how many resources you get. You don't get resources of other types that you pass by.

Or you can bypass the workers altogether and advance to the bottom side of your player board where you can build things and buy new workers. In order to return to the topside of your board you must a) cover up a worker on the top of your board and b) reduce your resource and coins down to a quantity of 3 total. So you can't hoard resources from loop to loop. There's a coin bonus when you loop to the bottom if all your workers are equal to or higher value in a clockwise direction. Money is tight so this is pretty important. There's several worker tiles available to buy, but whether they are the type you want and/or the right numbers will be important to pay attention to.

When building stuff on the main board, it's very important not to set up the next player... which leads to very odd building patterns that encourage (real-world) inefficiency.

There's a majority bonus for having the most workers of a resource type at the end of the game.

I really liked this one. The resource selection mechanism was clever. Building on the main board became pretty thinky which gave it a slightly mathy feel.

Not my favorite,  some luck when flipping tiles, and many times you just set your opponent up to take away what you have been working for, hard to control a decent strategy, when once a average player sees it, they can take it from you.  Also this game really suffers from is no catch up mechanic.   If a player jumps out in front, you mearly hang out for the next 45 minutes waiting for the end game to trigger. At that point you just gather 3-5 points per turn, and watch you piece mover around the scoring track, until the end when a majority of each worker scores bonus points, ties split, and it would be really hard to catch up since everyone will have the majority in one or maybe two worker types.

 Possibly the board could have been laid out better to allow higher point values to be further along, So you have to actually have to build up to gain big points.  Or perhaps each player has there own roads and color, so you could block them, or get to the better values by building your ownership of roads, homes, and mills. (but that would be a different game than this is trying to be) Alas, pretty much everyone is working on the same town.   

 I love eggertspiel, and see this as a mild gateway game. And is why I bought the game.  With all that said this may appeal to some.  Especially someone who wants to just take what is available on their turn,  and if you get big points early...  Your good!

P.s. final note,  the houses need to be another color, roads and milestones are black, and so our the houses.  So it is hard to distinguish the milestones from the houses, and being so close together on the board, it is frustrating.

Light game. Having to keep re-contructing your own rondel is interesting.

Crispy. Dry. Arbitrary rules. Abstract like a Colovini. Multiple scoring like a Feld. The tension of neither. I can see a game here. But I am not a fan. 

Milestones is a poster child for what I detest in Euros (and I'm a Euro player!) - detachment from theme.  I don't mean I expect a Euro to have lots of chrome or dice.  No, I mean the mechanics have nothing to do with the theme.

Why do players have to sacrifice a worker at the castle?  Are they indentured servants or slaves?  Why thematically does passing over a worker of the same type you land on result in an extra good?  Why do you benefit by having your workers in ascending order?  And those are just the questions I thought of in two minutes.

I'm a major critic of Feld and how detached his games are from their theme.  Yowza.  This one is super detached.  And unlike the abstract games created by Colovini (e.g. Clans), there's just so little tension. 

Another major issue I have is with the end game rule of allowing other players to play again once someone has passed a certain point on the scoreboard.  In a 2p game it's 67.  If player #2 passes that score first it means player #1 gets to go one more time.  That's a major bias in favor of the 1st player!  It's really not fair.  It means player #2 needs to play even better than player #1.  The game should just have equal plays.  If player #1 goes out first then player #2 goes again.  If player #2 goes out first then it's immediately game over. Or at least, that's the way it should be played.

very interesting light euro with unique worker management mechanic

[+] artwork & components, building the work-force with 2 factors in mind (what resource they provide and where to insert them) and the upkeep of having to sacrifice one wroker every "round" is an awsome mechanic, easy to teach, a player's turn is very simple (either get resources or pay/build/score), very fast paced (the only spot that can slow down the game is the trade/enroll spot), good sense of progression and picking up speed/power as the game progresses, seems very balanced (scores have always been tight with 2p/4p)
[+/-] I have mixed feelings about the "random" scores on the board, sometimes a road/house/market/grain is worth a lot, and sometimes not; it rewards opportunism and create interraction (you need to keep an eye on what others build/will build in the future), but at the same time, it can generate some small delta in scores that might end up giving the game to player A instead of B.
Another mixed-feeling feature of the game is the "my action sets the next player up"; if I build a road, then the next player can build a house for maximum pts; if I build a market, the next player can put grain in it for maximum profit; it's a thing to keep in mind for sure in this game.
[-] the end game scoring for majorities is pretty useless in 2p/4p games; in these configurations it's impossible to have 3+ majorities, most likely the majorities will be shared, so the delta in terms of points will be small (+/- 5pt) and usually does not make any difference, so what's the point. Only in 3p game have I seen/felt that majorities can swing the game significantly.
finally there's the big issue of the game end trigger... when I reach a certain number of points, I trigger the end game and can't play again, but everyone else gets an extra turn. if I'm first but someone is close behind, isn't it better to score maybe fewer points to stay bellow the limit (but keeping resources = a reserve of points) so that I let someone else end the game but will benefit from a couple extra turns to do another round trip... this is unfortunately very true in 2p game, where you benefit from dragging the game "1 more round" when in most game you would have ended sooner

This is a nice resource management game with enough of a twist to give it its own unique flavor. Since the players are constantly changing the resources they are able to generate, the game never feels too repetitive, and the road building on the map adds another layer of strategy without making the game too heavy.

Resource development. Player boards function like a rondel for your purchased worker tiles to generate goods (wheat, wood, stone, sand) while the greedy king keeps taking your workers away.  These goods eventually are converted into road segments and marketplaces to be placed on the communal board. More points for majorities at game end.  Intriguing puzzle to manage the flow of your workers. Best puzzle is scoring milestones while not allowing other players to leap frog you for better scoring. Takes a couple plays to catch on. Fairly abstract.

Love love love the private rondel. Provides great control and agonizing choices. Alas the center board where players are building roads and markets to grab points is a bit of a let down.

it's like Catan with the route building, resources and points for what you build... but with shared building pieces, without the player trading or robber or turns where you get hosed... and a cool rondel mechanic that changes as you play on your own player board...short, sweet, easy to teach and play...great!

What an unusual game!  This can be very opportunistic, but its mechanisms are so uncommon that I'd be happy to play it more.  It's pretty fascinating to play, and after the first game, all four players were unanimous in this thought: "I definitely will play this differently next time."  Quite fascinating!

Not a bad game.  Theme is completely tacked on and plays a lot like an abstract at some points.  Uses a roundel mechanism for actions.  Good, but not great.  I'd rather play Navagaedor, but I would definitely play this again.

My first Munchkin game (although I have played Ninja Burger, which is very similar). I greatly enjoyed the sense of humour on the cards, but truthfully I didn't find the game entirely engaging (at least on my first run). I did enjoy the interplay between players though, and I imagine that this would be a fun game when you're in the mood to screw over friends in a game or have a laugh.

I bought my sister Munchkin (original) so that we could try it and then later got her Munchkin Fu. The biggest downfall of Munchkin is the slow start and the seemingly never-ending game. We had a 5 player game go over 3 hours, which is way too long for this type of game. Our new house is to end the game after a deck runs out. At any rate, since I enjoy Munchkin so much (so funny!), I added Star Munchkin to my personal collection. 

UPDATE: Definitely, Star Munchkin is better than the other Munchkin games I've played. The card background colors are clearly different so it is easy to tell between the open-the-door and treasure cards in your hand. 2015 UPDATE: In the end, decided Munchkin days are behind me in favor of newer card games like Smash Up.

The fun with Munchkin was riffing on the tropes and cliches of fantasy role-playing.  Star Munchkin tries to do the same with the tropes and cliches of sci-fi role-playing, but the ground isn&#039;t as fertile, so it works less well.  Play as a &quot;Barrier Peaks&quot; style expansion to Munchkin rather than on its own.

Munchkin can be enjoyable for a bit, especially when combined with the various games of different themes, but ultimately, once you've seen all the jokes, the game is just a pile of bland and kingmaking.

It's Munchkin, but in space! The theme is cool, and some of the cards are pretty funny.

Munchkin itself is kinda fun, but it seems like the games always overstay their welcome and end the same way. Everyone saves up their best disruptive cards until the end, blows them on whoever's about to win, and then the second-place player steps in to win the game.

Kinda fun, and I had a bunch of fun playing with new friends at a swing-dancing convention last year.

I was somewhat disappointing with this. The game is essentially the same as Munchkin with a Sci-Fi paint job. As usual, the jokes and humor are hysterical. I personally found the setting and the rule changes a little lackluster compared to the original, but still a solid game and a solid add-on to the core game.

Munchkins in space.  That about sums it up.  Not nearly as witty as its predecessor but a good variation for those who like Sci-Fi and have watched all the 'classic' shows and movies as well as played any of the Sci-Fi Role Playing Games.  As there is no 'Dork Tower in Space' I think the game just does not have the foundation that Munchkin has to make it as good.  Still a good play and since the cards are not as witty I think it also does not feel like it gets as old as fast.

Not as good as the original - it's humour had more depth involving fantasy role-playing, the people who play it, game mechanics etc. Star Munchkin simply has genre jokes re Sci-Fi TV/Movies. Probably more accessible for non-gamers but you've also heard much of the material before from many sources (yeah, the guy in the red shirt always dies!). It's a light series relying on the jokes for a lot of the fun and too much is already tired here.

Beer & Pretzels games just aren't for me. The humor in this game is just lazy satirical references to other, far better games, movies and books. The game is just about as random as it could get.

Munchkin is the game equivalent of Scary Movie horror comedies -- Except that it takes longer than any of the films. If you like constantly proclaiming "I got that reference!" to other people, this game might be for you.

I went into Killer Bunnies expecting it to be a lighthearted, fun romp. As it turns out, Munchkin is actually the game I thought Killer Bunnies was going to be. 

It's not sophisticated mind you. It's not an "elegant" game or a deeply strategic game. It's got lots of luck in it so there's plenty to bag on with the Munchkin series if that's what you want to do.  However, if you approach the game from the standpoint of accepting what it is trying to be and not expecting it to be something it's not, then it can be quite enjoyable as a fun little game.

Munchkin games can become painful to play. But I love the themes and the stupid puns. 

We tend to play with a silent tacit agreement that people won't go overboard with the 'take that' cards.  In other words, the game can overstay its welcome if everyone does all the mean plays at their disposal. We still do some, but we also allow people to get close to the victory condition without hammering them mercilessly.  

Maybe that's outside the spirit of the game, but played with children and adults, it feels more enjoyable. I think if taken seriously where everyone is doing their best to win at all costs, Munchkin (and Star Munchkin) become painful and way too long.

Played once with 5 people, 3 of them non-gamers. The first few turns were dreadfully slow, as everyone was reading all the cards. Lots of luck, as the ones to draw the low-level monsters leveled up fast, while the rest hung back. The only exciting part of the game was in the last couple rounds where 3 of us were close to level 10. The only redeeming factor, and what kept it from a rating of 4, was the funny artwork and writing on the cards, which did get a few laughs.
UPDATE: I played this again with only 3 players, who all are gamers. It played much faster, thanks to a larger starting hand size. More player interaction. Many laughs. I have a better feeling about this game now. A good light filler game, with the right group.

Nice that the German version includes 2 unique cards - although 2 is much less than the 6-8 uniques in each of the classic Munchkin (Fantasy) expansions 2 through 6.
But still, it somewhat makes up for (unavoidable) translation problems with some other cards. Some of the plays on words are just bound to translate badly.

This is not a game for those who take other gamers' moves personally.  Though admittedly, this certainly can be a game for doling out punishment to someone...kick open the cantina and your neighbor slaps down Cthulhu and it's clone or Frank the Tank...or both.

I was so pumped about playing this the first time.  Then, I couldn't wait to play it again the second and third times.  But after that, I began to get frustrated at how long this game takes.  Not sure if this is a game flaw, but I've read that a lot of others say the same thing.

I don't feel like it's a "main event" game for any game night, so I've tried to put it out there as an "appetizer." At this point, I have debated about whether I even care to play it at all...but I still want to play it...hmm...

Added a house rule to shorten the game and make more treasures useful to at least somebody at the table: Start the game with each player drawing a random race and class card.  Ever been the guy who doesn't draw either one until someone else is already level 8 or 9?  No more!  After a few plays like this, I enjoyed the game much much more.  Rating raised up a bit.

I liked this game the first few times playing it -- discovering the hidden jokes and enjoying my time with friends. However, I tired quickly of the Munchkin system and the game can go on forever whenever you don't have a group that knows it in-and-out. It's typically just not worth it for me to bust out.

I love this game. I got it and the expansion(Star Munchkin 2: The Clown Wars) last week and got to play it last night. Needless to say, a good time was had by all. The only thing that's kinda annoying is the fact that the rules contradict eachother sometimes, but since this is stated in the rules and it says that you should settle this with a loud argument, I can't really complain. Good game, really funny card art, easy to jump right into and good for any number of players(I played with 5 and then 3). I am planning on getting more Munchkin games soon.

Same as the original Munchkin. Once you've seen all cards it becomes boring. Maybe this is a little better than the original, because of the crazy maser-bazer-banana-fazer weapons. Obviously the better choice when playing with sci-fi fans

It's Munchkin, which... you should know if you're playing this. I'm a huge sci-fi buff and had fully expected to be seduced by the theme of Star Munchkin, but... something just didn't grab me. I find I enjoy regular Munchkin more, probably because it just seems more complete. I think I was hoping for more borderline-copyright-infringement with the cards! Still fun, but if you have Munchkin, you don't need this.

Not something that I would want to play anytime soon. It's by Steve Jackson. II don`t really enjoy his games personally. His games are mostly card games. Not into card games that much, but there are some exceptions.

It's simply not my kind of card game. It doesn't really impress me as game.

It's very doubt full that I would replay this game any time soon to see if my opinion changes.

It doesn't really hold my interest. There are too many better games out there that playing this game on a regular basis is a waste of time. Why would you spend time playing a bad game when you can play a game which is more worth your time and enjoyment?

Don't plan in trying other munchkin games.

While a good munchkin game, the humor in this incarnation is much more obscure that the original or fu. Where as in munchkin you had the 'Boots of butt kicking' whichs works on serveral levels, cards like 'All your beast are belong to us' really only has one interpretation. As a result, rather than everyone getting into it with the constant question of 'did you bring munchkin!!??', only my tight knit group of gamers like it. This is comfounded by the fact that 2 player is terrible. For at least half of the game, neither player is able to do anything. In my opinon, the black sheep of munchkin.

Playdate is an estimate. Everything said, the game has acceptable mechanics, decent art, and somewhat entertaining cards. It's not for me. 

I also really dislike the game's humor. I'm really annoyed by this "I'm a geek and we're so silly, we play D&D in our parents' basement and we have no social skills" humor. It's just annoying. Please all you people who think this is funny, give it a rest. It's not funny. It never was.

I'm not familiar with other edition of Munchkin so can't say how it compares.  A lot of variety and humour with the various cards, and lots of player interaction.  Was very badly and then very fortunately affected by the luck of the cards - perhaps with more experience I could have mitigated the bad luck somehow?  Would definitely play again.

First entry into Munchkin. Enjoyed immensely, possibly because my son is the right age for it and likes silliness as much as I, possibly because we both like the dorky things they make fun of. If it had more fart jokes it would be a 9.

It’s also fast to set up and easy to play, so that makes for a more useful game.

Good improvement in Munckin, adding the sidekicks and the laser guns. Classes and races are not as good as the ones in the regular Munchkin, but the additions make it IMHO a better game than its predecesor, something that's not easy to acomplish.

Munchkin is Munchkin is Munchkin. The only reason to get additional decks is to pick up themes that interest you, or to create unusual deck combinations, as I don't think they're really expansions in the sense of adding much to the original base game.

Torno a comprare una nuova espansione di Munchkin, quella legata alla fantascienza. Che dire: adorando Munchkin non mi dilungherò dicendo che è un gioco semplicemente eccezionale, per di più questa versione richiama tutta quella fantascienza che amo (Star Wars, Doctor Who, Star Trek, ecc..) con lo spirito di Munchkin! Acquisto obbligato per me!

RATING: 7
Rates slightly higher then munchkin just because of the way you combine zers (lazortazorphazor).  For an amuzing house rule (which we didn't realize we were playing wrong) roll a D6 and add your effective level, and have the person to your left (unless they are helping, then the next person to the left) roll a D6 and add it to the monsters level.  Adds much more of a traditional RPG feel and some randomness to an already insane game.

I enjoy both Munchkin and science fiction, so this should be a match made in heaven. Unfortunately, some missteps in the design have led to some level of disappointment. While it plays just like the original Munchkin, there is just too much card text. It can seriously slow down the game, more so than usual. Like I said for Star Fluxx, this is completely in theme as sf can be unnecessarily overcomplicated as well, but it doesn't add to a game. It's more annoying than anything else.

Munchkin in Space.  Cards are improved:  treasure cards and door cards look different on BOTH sides, making them easier to sort.  Exactly like munchkin in every other respect though, meaning the rating takes a hit for lack of originality.  However, the excellent adaptation between fantasy and space makes the rating go up a notch.  I'd call it a wash.  Still hideously overpriced.  I bet if it cost half as much, twice as many would sell.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
A "stupid-fun" game. But my first (and probably last) game had too much downtime between turns. There are only two things to do, flip a card or two, attack something, and up your hit points. Yet, with six players, it took 30 minutes to finish one turn! The game makes a lot of references to SF, so this is the only entertaining part of the game. After the novelty wears off, you'll just want the game to end. Thus, in all likelihood, I am going to avoid all Munchkin games. Just shoot me.

Update (08/17/10): Change that last line to: "In all certainty, I WILL avoid all Munchkin games. PERIOD."
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Not quite as much fun as fantasy [i]Munchkin[/i].  Perhaps my nerd credentials need to be checked.

UPDATE:  [i]Munchkin[/i], as a knobbed-up commentary on fantasy RPGs, really only works when it's holding up its funhouse mirror to the fantasy genre.  I've never played a science fiction RPG the way I played [i]Dungeons & Dragons[/i] in 8th grade... so this doesn't work for me at all.

I would much rather just play fantasy [i]Munchkin[/i].

Munchkin moves to science fiction. Visitations instead of doors, aliens instead of fantasy monsters, and the added humour of red shirts to sacrifice whenever needed. However, one weapon that gets stolen around isn't enough of a "screw the opponent" mechanic.

We played this quite a bit before I realized that I hate it... a lot. I now refuse to play this regardless as it always ends the same - mass of people spam the person on last fight before they win (game is horribly uneventful up to this point). Person loses the fight or plays an 'instant win card' by negating monsters. Next player with 9 points wins on their next turn because everyone killed the the previous player.

Another in the munckin series. Nothing that innovates nor anything like that, but it's some fresh air to the original munchkin. I prefer the Munchkin Fu, but this one is also OK.

As with other Munchkins, pick the one whose theme attracts you the most and avoid adding any expansions to it.

Don't have the original, but I found this a bit less exciting than I might have expected. It hits most of the expected Sci-Fi humour mines, but leaves others curiously untouched (part of the expansion, no doubt). I was really expecting more of a game when I opened the box - I suppose I should have read the previews more carefully.

Certainly amusing and good for a few yucks - might take longer with more competitive players, but our group plays it for what it is - an amusing diversion. Might have rated a 7 but for the exorbinant price. $35 CDN for a box, a die, a sheet of rules and two decks of cards is space-lane robbery.

Sci-fi Munchkin. You'll enjoy the cards if you are into sci-fi - and that's about it.

Of the Munchkin family games I've played, this is the second best, second only to the original. It's not a deeply engaging game, as those who have played Munchkin know, but it requires virtually no setup time, and can be played very quickly. And I cannot overstate the joy of assembling a Laser-Laser-Raser-Daser-Maser-Schmaser-Bobaser-Bananafanafofaser.

RATING: 6
Of Munchkin, Fu, & Star, this one may have seen the most play by our group (though by a slight margin) just because we have a little more sci-fi geekery than fantasy or kung fu... my same groaning holds true from the other versions, though; gags were great at first, played it way too often, burnt out for now.

This is the only other Munchkin I bothered to list because it was my favorite, but it barely made it over Attribute. The reason it was my favorite was that there was only one expansion. We actually owned the first half dozen Munchkin titles, but after a while, they became annoying. Very annoying. Super Munchkin was the worst -- we stopped on that one.

It's trendy to hate Munchkin, I know. I'm not surprised. But at the same time Cosmic Encounter gets praised. Now I love Cosmic Encounter and it deserves all the praise. But really BGG? Munchkin is basically gateway version of CE, let's be honest. That's how Steve Jackson made it. Why hate it for that? I prefer Star Munchkin version since I love sci-fi. Most of  the jokes are funny in childish way. I prefer to play with 45min timer.

+Star Munchkin 3: Diplomatic Impunity

I like the cards in this game.  Being a sci-fi fan, the humor was more fitting.  The races and monsters are great, the items and weapons are okay.  Some of the items can cause infinite loops and at least one of the races is seriously overpowered.

The weaknesses of Star Munchkin are those of Munchkin: can take too long, is not fun with people who take it too seriously, and is extremely confusing to non-gamers.

Munchkin was my gateway game.  I enjoyed the humor of it and my friends got all the Hebrew editions for my birthday. After playing other games, it became clear that Munchkin is not worth playing. It's really long, and it isn't as fun as other games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
A step back from the original. This time we are making fun of Sci-Fi in general, and Star Trek in particular.
Useless races and useless classes. It's fairly obvious that Steve Jackson must've assumed that Munchkin would die fairly quickly, and thus threw this together as fast as humanly possible in order to make money while it was still hot...
Laser weapons are sort of fun, but you get over that rather quickly.

Was a gaming café a while ago. Was asked to play a Munchking game (Zombies I think) and realized I really didn't want to do so. So: 4 --> 3.

This game sucks. The cards have great art and the jokes are really funny, if you're a gamer, but there is no game. There is nearly no player interaction (which, I think is essential for a good game) and you don't even get all the parts you need to "play". Stinker. How this series keeps winning awards is a mystery to me.

This is very much like the original Munchkin but with a sci-fi theme that plays on popular franchises like Star Trek and Star Wars.

It has some interesting mechanics.  The "-aser" weapons that stack make for a unique decision.  On the one hand, you don't have to worry about running out of hands and it gives you the feeling of "leveling up" as your weapon grows in power, but on the other hand, you can lose it all at once if something causes you to lose your weapon.

Aside from that, it's the same game as regular Munchkin, for better or for worse.  It can be a hilarious, zany game, full of laughter and backstabbing, and the cards are just as funny as the original series (especially the Red Shirt sidekick).  But it's also a game where strategy takes a backseat to randomness and the game is won or lost based on the luck of the draw and the decisions of the other players.

It's a fun game and worth playing a few times, but it won't appeal to strategy fans.  We found it caused hard feelings among the more competitive people in our group and disappointed those who prefer more control and strategy in their game.  We still play it once in a while for laughs, but largely avoid it because of the fights that ensue.

I was hesitant about Munchkin but having never played it, I had to give it a whirl.  Okay game, not awesome but not offensive.  There's a decent system in place and there are some interesting decisions, but they don't overshadow the funny cards - which is a big part of the draw here.

My fave of the Munchkin series so far- we love the banana-fana-fo-phaser.  Another game that's a lot of fun with the right crowd, but certainly is more about socializing than having any sort of control over events.

And what is with the HORRIBLE quality of the cards in these games? For the price, you'd think the cards wouldn't come curved and on artscow quality stock...

(This game is a great entry into gaming..for non- board gamers) Star Munchkin is a great entry into the munchkin franchise. This game is much more balanced then the Original and very fun to play with fellow nerds. The redshirt side kick who sacrifices himself in battle is great and gets everyone laughing. This is my favorite entry thus far and like any munchkin game will get everyone playing.

A great twist on the Munchkin theme. New items like stackable laser weapons and sidekicks made this an excellent alternative for those bored of the original - however with numerous expansions now out for the "classic" version, this one never quite matches up.

I enjoy playing this version of Munchkin because I get the jokes better than the original version--I watched a lot of sci-fi growing up instead of role-playing.  A somewhat difficult to get game, but once you do, things move along.  The main problem with all the Munchkin games is that everyone is helpful until the end, when you gang up and go after people.  Then again... this sounds a lot like many games I've played.

Add two more plays as Munchkin expansion, don't know if there really is any real change other than the theme. Rated same 5 as the original.

The Munchkins are back - but now they're in space! Now they're Mutants, Androids, and Cat People... grabbing Lasers, Vibroswords, and Nova Grenades... fighting Fanged Fuzzballs, Bionic Bimbos, and the Brain In A Jar. This is a complete game using the best-selling Munchkin rules (with a few new twists like Sidekicks). Yes, it CAN be combined with Munchkin! And, of course, it features the twisted humor of Steve Jackson and the wacky cartoons of John Kovalic.

Read a card, laugh, put it away.
Repeat for all the deck.
Give away your copy of the game.

This is the only way i can  think of use this product.

Munchkins in space.  Same as other munchkins... but in space.

Even when I played munckin a lot, Star Munchkinjust didn't grab me. The theme should work but somehow the balance is wrong and it never gets out of its box.

Star Munchkin just isn't the same! I love the original Munchkin, but something about Star Munchkin is simply lacking. Maybe it's because I don't play any space-themed RPGs... I expected to love it, since I love scifi...but I don't.

We like Munchkin and this is an interesting version. It's about space and has some amusing things to it.

It's a canned humor game where people gang up on the leader.

Played once with a group of 4, it ran on for 2.5 hours and enjoyed it the whole time. We had Munchkin (original) mixed in with it. Very easy to pickup. Would play again.

Love the concept. Wish I had thought of it, that's for sure. Great 3+ player game, with lots of fighting and what not. Still, some of those rule conflicts will make your head hurt. But, that's what arguing is for.

This game uses the same rules as munchkins, meaning that it is good for the first 30 minutes, and then drags on for 4 more hours.  Such pain Mr. Jackson as given me!

It's fun to mix this with "The Good, the bad and the Munchkin" to play "Firefly Munchkin."

I'm just not a fan of the Munchkin games.  The first couple of plays are fun as you laugh at the cards.  Once the humor wears out there just isn't enough game there to interest me.

This was probably the first "game" I bought many many years ago. It wasn't until some 8 years later that my obsession would start. I remember loving this game when I bought it but I haven't played it in years. Since expanding my horizons I realize that it has deep flaws, however it's still good for a laugh or two.

Best with larger groups. Without the interaction of working together or ganging up on each other, it turns into brainless card-flipping.

Munchkin but with another theme. Not as interesting as the original.

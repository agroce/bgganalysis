Cute card game, seems a little broken due to the short supply of mice to cards, so it seems the one who gets the best sets first will win while those who take longer to gather the best cards lose out.

RATING: 7
Interesting little game, only plays of note are with two.  Love the decisions, plays quickly.  Inclined to think it is prone to degenerate strategies and greatly influenced by swings of luck, but very much enjoy playing it in an effort to find out whether or not that's true.  So maybe it doesn't matter, even if it is.

Knizia creates alot of card games - many of which are very similar.  Occasionally one stands out as cute enough to take notice of it.  Katzenjammer Blues is one such title.  Game play has a set collection goal with a twist in the use of 'jokers'.  The art work is notable and will appeal to some.  Yes, it's another Knizia card game, but its cute enough and fun enough to warrant plays.  [GTI: APCL]

One of my favourite quick Knizia card games.  Warning, do not cash in your cards too early or you can easily be frozen out of the bidding for the rest of the game - not fun if this happens, so warn new players.

Nice filler.  Was described as Rummy with bidding.  I'll have to play this one again because I'm a little bitter at sudden ending.  Seems like it would be better with less than six... the bids seem to rise to quickly if you are in the fifth or sixth position.

One of those "trade sets of cards to get better sets" games, like Money and Winehandler. This one works really well for 3, and the theme is really goofy.

RATING: 8
First play, we already knew I won no matter what happened.  I was disappointed as it seemed like the rating was correct (not the folk who really liked the game).  We went through and discussed tips and the second game was WOW.  It was a tense game.  I was trying to grab jokers so I could get to four in my hand before I took the last couple of mice.  She couldn't go out and she knew what I had in my hand, joker wise.  We had a lot of fun in the second game and we both really enjoyed it.  My rating reflects that.  Playing out multiple hands for a game seems good.  I think there is a ton of room for good, tricky, play in this one.

A great little filler card game. Plays in 10 minutes. Has elements of 'auction' and evaluating uptrades of cards. The sudden endings are fun. Jokers are critical.

Wow, trippy. The low number of score markers available make this end very rapidly. I liked it but it the others who played it didn't enjoy it.

RATING: 7
Quite fun after one play.  There does seem to be a slippery slope due to the limited number of mice where you need to get in early to lock down some points.   Getting stuck with most jokers also seems like pretty much an instant-loss, unless you can really dominate them.

And the award for the weirdest theme goes to...

Katzenjammer Blues, beyond the incredibly bizarre theme that was tacked onto it, is actually just a game about making melds from randomly created lots of cards while trying to mitigate the damage dealt out by random deals that occur from time to time. The theme, as I allude to above, is unquestionably one of the strangest that I've ever seen on a game, and makes me want to like it more on that basis, but it just doesn't succeed. I would call this a slightly sub-average card game for my tastes, and one that seems like it would play best with a lower number of people at the table to keep the chaos slightly under control.

Components: Nice artwork, with sixteen different cats, rather than the six the game could have gotten away with, which is a nice touch. The card quality is nice enough. I also like that groups of cards create a pattern of lyrics.

Experience: Very quick games. Unlike any other game I know, the joker is almost always bad news. It is difficult to build up a good hand, because after one meld I might not have good enough cards to win bids on more attractive lots; I like the system better in Money!, by which a player is guaranteed to get something, and my hand always improves. Still, it's mildly entertaining.

Interesting and quick resource management game. Cards a bid currency, but also what you need to trade i for points. Limited supply of mice can cause a sudden rush at the end of the game. Plays quite differently depending on how high the bidding goes (affects whether the deck or mice run out first). I honestly need to play it some more.

Not sure I like the swingy nature of the joker mechanism - a bad first draw can screw you.  But then, so can the cards that get offered, if you don't get the numbers you need at the end of the game to complete sets.  The whole thing just kind of happened, though I feel like I could see the interesting game they were trying to get to.

It's a short auction game with different, clever auction mechanics and a simple-enough scoring mechanic. BUT the game seems to be just a little too short. I'll be happy to try the game a couple more times, but my first impression is that it's just a little shorter than it needs to be.

2-player was great fun...until I read user comments about how holding all cards until a gin rummy finish was "correct" play, and now the game might be ruined for us.

Update: Not ruined. In fact, big meld finish only adds to the excitement. Three player is excellent. Any more after that, though, and it starts to falter.

I can't find the quotation, but I remember someone writing that Katzenjammer Blues starts in the middle and ends before you're ready.  That's a perfect description of the pattern of the game.  Playing with a larger number of players exacerbates the frustrating aspects of that pattern.  But with 3, it stands out as an accelerated, cutthroat game of hand management, timing, and seizing initiative.

RATING: 6
Four plays, twice with three, twice with two. Players bid cards to win more cards via peculiar bidding rules, after which they can turn in melds for points. There are jokers as well, and the catch is that the player with the most jokers—even unused jokers in hand—will lose five points. A very interesting little game that requires thought, though there's a lot of luck involved too. Playing just one round is unsatisfying, as it's over too quickly; I enjoyed it more when playing multiple rounds and tallying score.

With 5 players don't bother playing, its not nearly as good than with 3.  The 4 player partner game also looks interesting, must try soon. 

This is a nice little filler auction game that plays quickly and makes a good thinky game of about 10 - 15 minutes. Your trading cards for cards and eventually trading in sets for points, the key here is timing and managing your auction costs.

I agree that this game is best with three players. With more players it becomes obvious very early on who is out of the game and then that player may be put into what they feel to be a kingmaker position.

Other than that I enjoy the auction phase of this game since you are bidding your resources in order to get the auctioned resources. Careful hand management is necessary. A fun and fast game.

I like the exercise in trying to balance using cards as resources in the auction vs. using them to complete melds.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is an interesting auction game in that the point pool is finite. The first time you play you just play as many quartets for points as soon as you are able. With repeated plays the game reveals another layer. You don't play low point quartets but rather you save them for their subsequent bidding power. One player that "gets" this will dominate the game. When everyone gets this dynamic then you have another classic and quick auction game from Knizia.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Kind of an odd game - I'm not sure I understand how to play the auction.  It seems like one big early play can tilt the entire game.  It has felt very unbalanced, and I've played with three players, which is what I understand to be the sweet spot.  I need to play it more though to really get a good feel for the game.

Update: Played with two and it still felt weird.  However, I feel more compelled to try it again - I appreciated it more this time around.

A seemingly fun, simple, Knizia filler cardgame--seemingly.  Somehow, though it misses the mark.  Typically math-based bidding mechanic.

The jury is out on this one--rating could rise or fall on further play (Update: it fell).

I usually feel like the hand ends at just about the point that I'm really ready to get started.  Random jokers can really spoil a hand, and random cards in general can make it pretty unplayable due to not having cards good enough to win with and still have cards left to win bids in the future.

Random jokers strike again.

2-6p. 25m.
Light card game only played once with 4 adults, so no one wanted to make mistakes and use Jokers as part of their "quartets" (melds).  The turning over of the multiple cards at the beginning of the round is fun when everyone groans if there are only 2 or 3 cards to bid for, or "oohs-n-ahs" when there are more.

Traded away eventually.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A game about investments. You can easily shoot yourself in the foot and drop out of the game if you spend too much, and the jokers add a substantial element of random misfortune (or fortune in some cases). The limited supply of mice is a nice twist. In the end, however, the game can be a bit annoying and not all that fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Played 10-15 times. Enjoyable, but you need to warn new players that the game can end very quickly, and that you only score points if you win auctions.
The Jokers add quite a bit of randomness, and who actually wins may feel a little random. I enjoy the ride, though.

RATING: 7
Rating based on perceived 3-player game.  I've only played this as a four-player where my rating would drop to a 5 (there's just too little VPs and not enough time to coordinate a gameplan).  With 3 I could see how there are some meaninful choices.  Players are bidding cards to earn new cards.  The goal is to create a meld of 4 like cards which are worth face value in VPs.  Cards range from 1-5 and a joker.  The joker can be played as any card but whoever has the most jokers during the end of the round loses 5 points.  One key tactic is earning the pot (winning the bid) just so one can have control (and not to mention you can only meld if you had won the last bid).

RATING: 6.5
Bizarre game of "trading up" your hand. Nice tension between high value cards (more points) and low value cards (great bidding chips), plus when to score (which decimates your hand). Need to play again correcting a rule we missed, but definitely intriguing.

Fairly straight forward game: you bid on cards using cards in your hand. Then, you play down cards when you have 4 of the same number and get mice equal to the number on the card. When the mice are gone, the game is over. Most mice wins.

Play melds of cards to earn mice. Once all 20 mice are gone, game ends. Appears to be a broken game by Knizia. All mice were gone before we were halfway through the cards. Maybe we missed something here.

I became less enamoured with this one. Not that I was enamoured before but I at least thought it was a fun enough distraction. Every game I've played, whoever had most jokers has been nailed. In our group, anyone with a decent size hand simply bid their max bid straight up, effectively killing the bidding process (the fun bit). Anyone who made their scoring moves early, hoping the rest of the mice would be spread about, simply watched the rest of the game without a chance to influence it. I took to inspecting the artwork to help pass the time. It failed the family test a while back as well.

RATING: 6
I always felt this card game was underrated, and my re-ignited interest due to the unique bidding and simple scoring status still confirms that feeling. A game which pays to listen, card count (an overwhelming number) and deduce who may have the most jokers, as well as knowing when to force someones bid and when to meld. The only claws, er.. flaws are i)if there are early rich pickings and you have an initial bad deal it is difficult to catch up to those who are richer ii)that there is only one strategic approach: win auctions to build your hand strength, melding early is too risky. Pushing opponent's bidding limits is fun and tense. As auction games go this for me is the cat's meow, but it doesn't seem to instil the same feeling in others. One comment that the player with most jokers will lose has been disputed in my last game.

Plays particularly well with three. Nice, tight, underrated auction card game which lends itself well to playing for money. Excellent with three (and maybe two) players, but I reserve judgement on its suitability with more. As with most Knizia games there are hidden depths, but the theme leaves me baffled.

What a clever little game this is! Despite its reputation in Germany as an neglectible little filler, I got carried away by some friendly comments here on BGG, and grabbed it from the bargain bin. I'm very impressed by its simple elegance. If you like LOCO, MONEY or the KING ARTHUR cardgames, you will surely like this one, too. Its short playing time always allows for a revanche, and it's great with any number of players, from 2-6. Have I mentioned the beautiful artwork?

I found this game to be quite intriguing.  The limited scoring pool forces you to not take too long to set up your hand and try to score points.  However, you have to go slowly enough to actually build up your hand.  On top of this, you have to do something with those pesky joker cards.  Lots of great game in a little package.

RATING: 7
Early rating after playing 2 players.

A mixture of auctions, set collection and melding. Players start with a hand of cards (deck has 15 jokers and 15 cards each of values 1 to 5). Each turn, cards are turned over and players use their hand to bid for these new cards. 

The winner of the bid is also allowed to lay down a meld of 4 of the same cards to pick up some mice tokens equivalent to the value of the meld. When the last mice token has been taken, the game is over. The person with the most tokens win. However, there's a Kniza twist: the person who used the most jokers in bidding and melding, loses 5 tokens.

There are some tense moments with players having to work out the risk and values of auctions.

Terrible card game. Played it once and hated it.  Didn't want to give up on it since the game store owner recommended it as his favorite 2-player game.  Tried it a second time and hated it even more.  This is the type of game I get baffled about. How would a manufacturer agree to go to market with this?  My guess is the designer's name was attached. I stalled the game for 30 minutes winning every bid (nobody could outbid me).  Finally the other 2 players forfeited the game.  Is this what they mean by "broken"?  *SOLD IT*

This is a great little set collection / bidding game.  Nice because it really works with two players as well, a rare treat for an auction game.

Little of tough choices, with a great sense of hand management matched with pushing how far you can go before you have to cash in.  Probably best with three in three rounds.

Those mice go fast though...

A quirky Knizia that looks light, especially with the cool looking artwork, but in reality is so tight that one wrong move can send he rest of your game spiraling.  A special bonus for me  since I bought it in a Las Vegas game store along with Too Many Cooks.  I kept that receipt in my wallet for years!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.75
2 plays looks like there may be some potential, but I need more plays to solidify my rating.  Right now I expect it to go up some.

Several more plays, and like many Knizia games this one shows its stuff only when played several times--a very solid two or 3 player game!

Now, after many, many (and even more), plays--this game is quite good with 3 but lack a little with 4 players.
If you play with four it's shortcomings (which are basically that the mice go a little too quickly and the game becomes less controllable since there can be 2 bids before you get a chance, sometimes striping your ability to control the bids) can be alleviated by simply:
a) play 1 hand per player, so 4 hands
b) keep a running total of mice won, rather than just hands won--this way close losses become as important as important as wins and does indeed return much of the strategic play

With 2 players, the game is near perfect--with painful bid vs meld decisions throughout.  

I would rate this one as 7 played with 4 using combined mice and at least 4 hands, an 8 with 3 players, and a 9.5 as a two player, so I'm averaging the rating at 8.75
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I'm going to have to admit this game works only very poorly for six players.  Highly recommended for three or four, and does work for two or, just barely, for five.  For three players who really know what they're doing, the game is an 8.

RATING: 6
[Goldsieber 1998 edition] {Cats; auction, set-collection, hand management; optimal 3-4p} KB is an early Knizia card game. It's a good game: fun, interactive and tactical. The game play is quite tense due to the limited supply of mice and the special claiming rule (players can collect mice ONLY after they won a bid); therefore, bidding becomes fiercer at late game.  Since the cards are used both for bidding and claiming award, it requires good hand management skills. Luck is not a critical factor in KB since luck can somehow be counterbalanced by bidding.  I like the design that those having most Jokers will get penalty.  Joker is very useful; however, as the game is designed, relying heavily on Jokers is not wise.

3p should be the optimal player for this game. 4p is still ok. It's too chaotic with 5 or 6 players and the game ends quickly.

The price of the game is reasonable. The cards are nicely illustrated and funny; though busy. The mouse token is cute but thin. I am glad that I own this little decent card game.

Even after just one play, I'm convinced Katzenjammer Blues is not for me. Far too chaotic and clumsy in the short term, too unfulfilling to play in the long term. Especially when there are so many instances where a game can be "over" after just a few melds -- where it becomes impossible for anyone to seize a point advantage over the current leader, yet you still need to play out the hand unless you're content only having gone once or twice around the table as a "game." Blech.

Fun, quick little bidding game.  Don't bid too much early on, otherwise you won't get a mouse the rest of the game.  Rating may change on more playings. Update: I don't have a big desire to play this much any more.  For some reason, the game really annoys me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.2
This game can put you through some agonizing decisions as to how the heck you are going to get the cards you want without throwing away the cards that make you want the auctioned cards in order to get them.  That aspect of this game forges its kinship with [thing=125]Money![/thing] (also by Knizia).  The harsh, intentional brevity of this game practically requires that you play it several times consecutively, in order to get your mind into the right pacing to do well.  I really like the bidding rules:  You may bid X secret unique cards or X declared identical cards, but X identical always beats X unique.

RATING: 7
After 2+ Plays: This is a neat little game with a very different feel.  The mechanics are pretty unintuitive, so I feel like I need a few more plays to really form a solid opinion.

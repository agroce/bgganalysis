Goblins - or as we're starting to call them, the green taliban.  Originally we thought they'd play out as "death by a thousand cuts", but they definitely seem to be more of a "I might die, but I'm taking you with me" style.  My buddy loves playing this faction.

Low-medium complexity fantasy miniatures skirmish game.  It is themed around D&D 4th edition, but has little in common with that game.  Creatures automatically hit when they attack and do a fixed amount of damage (which can be boosted or reduced by card play).  It's fine, but doesn't excite me.  I would prefer to have dice rolls to liven things up.  The miniatures are quite nice for pre-painted minis.  Including cards to use the minis with the [family=9547]D&D Adventure System board games[/family] is brilliant.

This game plays very well, with adequate chance for battles to swing back and forth depending on timing and unit positioning. There are noticeably different characteristics that make each army different while remaining balanced. It will become better and better as more and more sets come out, provided that WotC can maintain balance across those factions.

I don't like to deck build. Fortunately, playing the warbands as they were designed is thematically sound. It feels similar to Summoner Wars, but without dice, and with different resource management mechanics. You don't build magic, just try to put whatever you need out when you need it, as much as you can (given your limited leadership).

The miniatures, while not stunning, separate Dungeon Command from other skirmish games. The fact that this game can almost always be found for less than $30 makes it a good value for what you get.

Well presented: very nice pre-painted minis; quality art on cards; map on hard stock. I love the fact the that monsters can be directly integrated into other D&D board game sets (Castle Ravenloft, et al) without rules adjustments (brilliant in its simplicity).  I like the idea of various factions and hope that WoC pursues further sets. Basic, fun stand alone skirmish game. The small map squares, however, do not accomidate the minis.  All said, Goblins are my least favorite faction to play. I find myself with a hand of unplayable cards far too often... * frustrating *

Dungeon Command has been compared to games like Star Wars: Epic Duels, Summoner Wars, and Magic: The Gathering, and there are certainly elements of all of those here. Dungeon Command is primarily a tactical minis game, with movement and positioning being crucial to victory. However, it is also a card game (hence the Magic comparisons) and hand management plays a big role as well.

Each player controls an army of 12 figures and a deck of 30 or more cards. A figure has an inherent movement, attack value, and special abilities. But all of these can be enhanced by playing cards on them. Knowing when to play these cards and how to position your figures are two of the biggest choices the game offers. Despite having diceless combat, almost nothing in this game is calculable, which I love. There is never an obviously right answer for how far you should move, whether you should get a treasure, whether to stay together or split up, to play a card or not, to cower (which hits your morale) or not (which kills your units), and so many other choices.

For a relatively simple rule set, I think Dungeon Command offers a ton of meaningful choices and a depth of gameplay that will require many games to master. None of that even takes into account the additional layer of customizable army/deck-building. This one is a winner.

Played with 2 players and 1 Faction Pack, this game is terrible. My Girlfriend and I were really looking forward to this, and the game seemed sluggish and fairly predicable after the first few turns.

Played with 2 players and 2 Faction Pack (the way the game was designed), this game is much much much better.  As a tabletop gamer, I like that this game combines the tactical strategies of Heroclix and other minis games with the card fighting aspect of Magic that my girlfriend enjoys.

This game sits squarely between Magic: The Gathering and Summoner Wars for me--and takes the place of both in my collection. Cool painted minis (that are compatible with the D&D Adventure System games) liven up the presentation but the real hook here is that diceless, card-driven gameplay combined with a decent little tactical miniatures game.

Played this game for the first time with 3 people yesterday.  That is a fun way to play as the winner is the person with the Highest Morale when one player dies.  That being said, I would really like to give it a go with 4 players.  And yes, i like it with 2 players probably a little better than 2, but visiting at the table between turns also has its value with friends and family.

Dungeon Command is a Dungeons & Dragons card-driven skirmish game played on modular interlocking map tiles that uses action cards, creature cards and miniatures. 

Dungeon Command: Tyranny of Goblins includes twelve miniatures, such as a horned devil, a troll, a bugbear, hobgoblins, and goblins. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Dungeon Command is grossly under-rated skirmish game pitting two factions against each other in a dungeon or outdoor setting.  Game play is card driven and there are no dice.  It very much has a 4th edition D&D combat feel but without the d20.  

Includes goblins, hobgoblins, etc, that are quick and challenging to play.  Not the strongest war band but in skilled hands can perform well.

Tyranny of Goblins is considered the weakest faction.  I don't see that, you need to use the goblins speed to your advantage.  I like this system a lot.

* I track all Dungeon Command plays, and my overall thoughts on the game, on Curse of Undeath (the first faction I tried). I want to know how often I play it, not how often I play each faction. *

As a faction, I like the goblins. The minis are a bit blah -- small and mostly green means most of them lack the oomph of the larger, more detailed minis -- but everything else is dandy.

Their abilities and stock deck are neat, and they offer some interesting opportunities for surprising your opponent.

3 / 5 - Good.

This is my favourite Dungeon Command set. The Goblins are fast and maneuverable with lots of varied card effects which makes them tactically flexible and far more interesting than the "hit, hit harder" approach most of the other boxes take.

RATING: 5
At the very beggining playing DC, this faction seemed to me like crap. Nowadays I enjoy playing it more than others (except Heart of Cormyr) because I understand at last its performance and the way it should be played: this is a heavy melee combat faction highly dependant of its own charimatic creatures; besides power, charisma is the most important quality to win with goblins.

Purchased for painted monsters that can be used in DnD adventure system board games. They look great and add a lot. Totally worth it. Less interest in the actual mechanics for this as a stand alone game even though I hear it's pretty good. Not sure I'll ever take the time to try it out--have other tactical games and not as into fantasy for the tactical (small party) team against other team thing.

This faction has some of the stronges creatures in the game, but is still signifficantly weaker than ANY of the other ones. If you just want to play starter vs st starter out of the box DON't get this one.
HOWEVER! if you can afford to take TWO of those, you can build two very different and quite awesome warbands - a horde of quick sneaky little goblins that dogpile opponents, then get buffed and eat their faces off, PLUS a heavy-hitting huge monster-type band that shreds oppnents' creatures to peces with sheer attack power.

When I first bought these dungeon command games, I did it only for the miniatures and the tiles, as assets for d&d games. Yesterday after almost 4 years, me and my friends, decided to give them a shot as game.
The game is really interesting, both generals and the races can change a lot the game. It can be played with 3 and 4 people (we tried it both). Havent played the 2 player version yet, but the multiplayer system was great.
Strategy,  wargame, great miniatures and great cards. You have a lot to think, where to move, where to hide, what cards to use, which one to attack and with whom to hold peace. I am glad to have this in my collection. Loved the experience and my friends and wife, already ask for the next gamenight. Try it with multiplayer and have fun!

The game system itself is nice, an interesting diceless minaiture combat sytem. It has simple rules, but gains
complexity from multiple unit types with unique special abilities, and Order cards. It's a bit like Magic with
minis, or a really weird version of D&D minis. 
The miniatures in this set are very nice, the Troll is
especially terrifying. If you can get a good price, its
a great source of minis. I purchased this specifically to
add to my D&D Adventure System games, and the Monster Cards
fit right in (especially in Wrath of Ashardalon). I do wish
there was more in that way, such as a single themed
adventure. I'm looking forward to future sets. How about
Dark Sun and Gamma World sets?

[b]Pros:[/b]
- Great replayability and variability due to:
--- random card drawing from deck
--- re-positioning of 4 board pieces
--- (so far) 5 very different factions 
--- different positioning and thus strategy of your warband every time
- Beautiful painted miniatures
- Beautiful cards
- Factions are balanced
- You can assemble your own Warband from more than 1 faction

[b]Cons:[/b]
- Lacks mechanic that will make fighting necessary (one player can just hide in convenient place and "wait until the other guy will step into the trap").
- Game under 3 hours are very rare
- There is no point to play it as 3-player game (there is no game mechanic against "hide and wait" strategy until other 2 players fight between each other)

Fun game, but the price is a bit steep considering you need to have any 2 different sets to have any real fun. And forget customizing unless you want to buy a duplicate set... Seriously, $50 MSRP just to customize ONE army! and to play a good game with 2 of the 5 factions out at this time your at $100.... They need to include duplicates in each set at this price point. Or at least sell individual characters and command card sets. That said, I still bought all of them once and enjoy playing...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
After the first deadly encounter, the Goblins seem a slightly bit stronger and can be played more aggressivley than the Undead army... which means I will need a good strategy for the next battle against them and a steady hand and head when playing with them. 
Still so surprised by how much enjoy these minion fights :-)

The goblins play quite nicely as a swarm army with the ability to move all units on your turn. I was mildly concerned about replayability, but since each turn you should only see about a third of your order cards and maybe a half of your creatures this should easily last 5 or 6 plays - at which point you change up the opposing army.

It doesn't feel particularly chaotic either, though I'd really only recommend the 2 player game...

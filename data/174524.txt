RATING: 6
The components and game production value is great, and I really like the game company that designed it. That being said, I cannot stand "take that" as a major game mechanic. It is very strong in this game, especially if you tend to play games mostly 2-player, which makes this a non-starter for me. I should have done more research when backing this on Kickstarter, but I wanted to support the game company. I sold it away at a loss, since it is available at a lower price online than when I backed it on KS.

Not the best game for 2 players. I would rather have 3-4 be the norm. The score tracker hinders fun play of the game. I would rather have score sheets to tally up after the game (doesn't take too long for each player) and the numbers are not really that dark and easy to see..Lots more that can be improved but is still a fun game.

Backed on kickstarter and turned out to be a surprisingly great game. Nice artwork that goes well with the theme. Enjoyed playing it and can't wait start introducing it to others as its a simple and light game that is easy to learn. 

Character stealing is an option that works both ways: annoying and to annoy friends with ;-)

Secret goals can be a bit too much. But overall a good game to play anytime. Just put up a good Western, serve some drinks and start playing ;)

A solid, serviceable game that didn't do anything especially new or creative. The three dimensional of building your saloon is nice, but the cards and movement of the characters along with the endgame all feel underdeveloped and unsatisfying.

2016-09-12 : None of the components or mechanics of this game are anything new or revolutionary, but the way it was all put together simply works.

After two plays, enjoying it so far. The components are good...not great. The tiles are very thick and durable at 3mm, yet the cards are very flimsy, and even having sleeved them, I'm still concerned they may bend. The cowboy meeples are a nice touch, though very small...as is the score track. The gold nuggets are a nice touch as well. As far as gameplay, I like the variety in tiles and both the common and secret goals to play toward. The outlaws really mess up your game and you want to rid their presence from your saloon town as fast as you can. I like all the mini expansions that came with the Kickstarter edition. So overall, very happy I backed it and can't wait to get it to the table again!

A light, nicely produced game of Saloon building. The artwork is quite evocative of theme, but the game play is quite dry, and swingy. Cards are uninspired and generally overpowered relative to the other choices (the 2 gold action shouldn't even be an action based on my play). Game is a real space hog the way all the tiles and cards are laid out in addition to a large board per person. For my taste, there wasn't much I'd call original or intriguing. That said, it's not all that bad either, especially if you tend to like chaotic card games. It's just not a game I would choose over so many others out there.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Outlaw cards are like a bad catch up mechanism.   Citizen cards seem unnecessary too.  Buildings are fun to build but there should have been a good mix of useful powers on the tiles  and no Tycoon cards.   Those are swingy and also feel unnecessary.  Kind of fun but feels underdeveloped.

When I first saw this game on Kickstarter I was totally excited for the theme and overall game play it was going to bring.  I brought it over to a friend's place and we opened it up there.  It took us about 10 minutes to go through the rules and start understanding the game.  It was a quick learn and gave a lot of play options.  Love this one.  Totally recommend it!

Kickstarted. Absolutely love this game! The western theme and art are awesome, and the novel approach to placing tiles is great!  The cards in hand and open claims are extremely important, as you may build a much larger saloon, but miss out on lots of achievable reputation points.  Just the right complexity too, not rocket science, but no cakewalk either.  If I had to list cons, it'd be for larger "cowboy" meeples, and a scoring board that is easier to see.  These are very minor issues for me as the components are great!  I heard someone complain about the cheapy plastic gold pieces, but these are so thematic I wouldn't want to play without them!  My gosh, home run!

Very fun game with a great theme!  We played 4 times last week and we enjoyed this game quite a bit.

Pros:
- Fast turns
- I love to have the secret claims cards (and there are a lot of them in the box)
- I also love when there are open objectives for everybody (Open claims)
- The game is beautiful and very thematic
- I love the 3D aspect of this game
- Each of our games were quite different
- The game has some "take that" elements (which I don't like that much) but it's easy to play without those elements.

Cons:
- It takes a lot of place on the table!

RATING: 8
Backed on Kickstarter. It reminds me of Vegas Showdown with some Suburbia mixed in. The building system gives you a lot of options as you choose to both build up and out, and I like that the cubes to build up also serve as the in-game timer. The rulebook, despite a few typos, is very good and answers any questions that may come up. I had friends down for GenCon when we broke it out and they're looking to get their own copies.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
An excellent and interesting building game mired by two unforgivable attributes: 1. Endless and aimless take that character stealing and 2. Swingy secret goals and unbalanced action cards

I really enjoy about 80% of this game, but the 20% I've described above prevents me from ever wanting to participate in another game. I commented on the BGG page with my concerns (and pleaded for a fix since I like so much of the game), where I was told that the game wasn't made for my playstyle. I can't disagree. I'm not saying there's a right way or wrong way to make a game, but making it for the widest audience possible seems automatic, though that wasn't a concern for the publisher. Missed opportunity.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Wasn't sure about this one at first, but after a slow couple of rounds we all fell for it hard and by the end of the game wanted to set it all back up and go again.
The only negatives I would give are that it takes up a lot of real estate on the table, the scoring track needs some better graphic design (it's nicely thematic but difficult to use), and the cards could have been a bit heavier card stock. Those few negatives though are minor and are far out shined by the quality of the rest of the game components, the tiles, meeples, blocks, and currency are all top notch and make the game a joy to play. 
No regrets on having taken a gamble on this game.

Quick playing euro game with attractive theme that is used well. Spatial element, some light take that and some hidden information keep it interesting all the way. Scoring board sucks, but besides that the game is graphically very strong. Especially the gold nuggets are cool. My only concern after playing this is whether the level of synergy each player has between the claims they receive in the beginning can be a too decisive factor in deciding the outcome of the game. I very much suggest playing this with the expansion and after playing both with and without it I think it is essential.

Very straightforward to play.  Has a bit of take that so be prepared to be screwed over by opponents.  Pretty shallow strategy and may feel a bit repetitive so not likely to get many plays by me.  It was fun to try to be efficient and build up your saloon to complete your goals.  Good for a couple of plays at most, I'd guess.

RATING: 5
Interesting concept, but very fiddly and difficult to play. It has a massive footprint for such a small game, and each section has its own rule to learn. The characters are meant to mix up game play, but actually slow it down and make it random. There are several triggers for adding characters that you simply have to remember mid-game. I found my plays to be frustrating as I could see the fun game underneath.

Nice components, except for the graphic design of the score track which is one of the worst I have ever seen.   Just wish the gameplay was better. There is way too much to keep track of for a game that seems to want to be silly and light.  There are too many "take that" cards in the deck and too many punishments for doing well.  If so many have to be in the game to prevent a runaway leader, perhaps more development was necessary.  As the game stands, it plays like typical KickStarter crap.

There are a lot of great decisions to make, a lot of replay value due to the claim cards. The expansion adds to the fun but isn't necessary to enjoy the game.

My only reservation is that there is a decent amount of luck that creeps in due to the cards you can play or someone buying something that completely wrecks your secret claim.

Explaining the game to a newbie goes fairly quickly so that's nice.  A two player game can be finished easily in 45 minutes.  I appreciate the balance between needing to complete your goals before running out of time and meandering towards your goals so as not to tip your hand.  The game is over before you know it so on the one hand, you kind of feel like you wanted to do more, but on the other, there's not a lot of hesitation to set the board back up and play again (we're not talking Axis and Allies here).

I appreciate games that aren't overly driven by luck.  In Saloon Tycoon, the players provide the bulk of the randomness.  Sure, you get dealt different secret claims that dictate what direction you go, but, especially in a four person game, the overlap in strategies and goals makes for variation without getting screwed waiting for just the right card to come up.

This is my new favorite game and my go to whenever I can find time to play something (an enjoyable 2 player game is a must).

Maybe not bad, though difficult to tell on a first playing.  You build an engine in such a way as to fulfill contracts for points.  The engine-building per se is interesting enough, with tiles to build and then put pillars on in such a way that additional levels can be built.  There's a competition for some of the contracts, and some are secret but may turn out to have more than one player needing to achieve the same steps toward goal.  For example, two of our three players tonight needed control of the Schoolteacher card and took it away from each other back and forth.  So lucky goal-selection is one of the big keys to victory, which is probably not ideal.

Tile placement action point system to build the most popular and profitable saloon in town.  The heart of the game comes from the card driven old west tycoon cards used to expand your saloon upwards and outwards to add functional rooms built with supplies.  I like that some cards add a push your luck element. Earn more gold as the saloon grows that soon attracts customers, staff, and outlaws needed to complete private and public goals.  Fun building prerequisites to plan through. Unique game end triggered by the exhausting the supplies.  Fun tension when a race ensues to grab unique or limited rooms or characters or completing the same goal.  I like the outlaw punitive effect that slows down leaders. Good thematic feel, easy to play, with enough cards with a take that edge.  Takes a little setup time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The private and open claim cards alone provide a good bit of replayability. This game has a lot of "take that" elements to it. If you like that sort of thing, you'll probably enjoy it.

On the difficulty scale, I'd say this is only a little more complex than Ticket to Ride. However, with each tile having different functions and abilities, it takes a few plays to get all of the iconography memorized. 

All that to say, this was the first ever project I backed on Kickstarter, and I'm glad I did. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
An interesting game that suffers somewhat from being a mix of some cool things and some half-baked things. I like that the game focuses heavily on competition for scarce resources (note to those who dislike "take that" and other nasty interactions: this game has quite a bit of that).  The components are generally pretty nice too.

I don't like that the game has a very clunky way of commanding those resources.  The heart of the game is the tycoon deck, which is really the most effective way to get things done in the game.  It is bizarrely very small, with a strange distribution of actions in it.  In a 4P game, we re-shuffled this deck at least 3 times, this should never be.

The deck should be much larger and have a better distribution of equal powered actions.  As such, it had a profound influence on action distribution throughout the game, which led to pretty big disparities.  There are ways to mitigate this, but it seems odd that the deck didn't have a bit of that baked in. Actions can chain, so there needs to be opportunity for everybody to make this happen instead of one player depleting the deck of good actions in one or two turns.

I'd never want to play this as 2P, it just wouldn't work.  A lot of the mechanics in the game seem to punish the leader, which is odd.  It just is too much of a blatant check on the runaway leader, and leaves you wondering why that had to be in there.

The VP track is oddly designed and pretty much useless, so you'll want to make your own (we simply counted at the end).  And many of the components suffer from tiny, unreadable icons.  The game desperately needs a player aid with this info. on it for easy reference (which I am sure some enterprising BGG'er has done, so look in the files section).  In fact, the whole game is a bit fiddly, both in components and in gameplay.  The rules are not bad, though, and the game is simple enough and easy to teach.

All in all, it is a decent game, but it is not one that will hit the table over and over.  It definitely has some uniqueness to it, but like many kickstarters it probably could have used a bit more time in the oven.  if you are a house rule type person, this game probably is a hidden gem.

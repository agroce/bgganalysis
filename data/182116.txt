:thumbsup: The artwork is beautifully reminiscent of a dreamscape with bright environments and adorable animals.
:thumbsup: Choosing which row or column to move each turn adds onto the puzzle and is quite satisfying.

[microbadge=30754][c] [/c]The solo game is almost entirely a race to win in the shortest amount of time, with little actual difficulty.
[microbadge=30754][c] [/c]Most of the dream cards are almost too easy, and hazards can not apply to solo opponents.

:thumbsdown: The colors are all very similar, which makes it difficult to find the matching tile at a glance.
:thumbsdown: Keeping all of the tiles orderly is a real challenge, as a slight bump can create mayhem.

The best part about this puzzle/game is that you can play for as long as you want by adjusting the number of victories that it takes to win the game. There is no player interaction. It would have been good if the artist had made a greater contrast in colors between the front and back of each tile.

RATING: 7.5
This is a game that could easily be overlooked as simplistic, but that does you and the game a disservice.  For lurking under this game is a real family puzzler that will appeal to game players and puzzlers alike.  The goal of the rounds is to get your tiles into a specific arrangement, but you do so by sliding a tile into a row or column.  The tile in hand changes each round, but is determined by a common draw pool - so all players are moving the same tile.  It's a bit of a mix of Take it Easy and Ubungo.  And in the end - its a fine & fun game.  Don't over look it.

RATING: 8
Another gorgeous looking effort from Red Raven Games, the publisher's first real foray into a family-weight title. An Alf Segeert design with Ryan Laukat's trademark artwork, and quite a neat little spin on something like Bingo, but you're trying to guide your animal through a dream. That mechanism in which you've constantly got to manage that extra tile, sliding it on and off your dream-grid is pretty cool actually and makes for some thinkier decisions than you might have expected, and overall this just feels fresh and fun to break out, and accessible to a broader audience than an Ancient World or Above or Below, as much as I love those two.

Publishers really missed a trick here not calling this dingo bingo.

Surprisingly good fun and terrible Australian accents all round here. Simple bingo like game but with a touch of strategy added with the tile movement mechanic.
Jumped straight in with the 'advanced' hazard mechanic and to be honest I am not sure you would ever play it another way
Really enjoyed this one

RATING: 2
Dingo's Dreams is a game in the tradition of Take It Easy which means it really isn't much of a game at all. Part bingo, part sliding puzzle, there is no interaction whatsoever as each player tries to arrange his or her personal tableau in the requested pattern. Lucky flips will sometimes just drop into place while most of the time you will simply make the most obvious move towards the solution.

The so-called advanced rules are even worse than the standard game for two reasons. Unlucky flips will heavily punish random players and they can actually make the puzzle entirely unsolveable.

Got this over the exchange, and Im happy for it. Honestly, this would never be one I would pick up...and sometimes you just never know what will hit those right buttons.  I feel sort of conflicted about this title...Here are the good things, Great production quality, wonderful art, easy to learn easy to play. However, it honestly is straight up BINGO. Whats good, is they have variants to ramp up the difficulty...however, its just straight up BINGO. And, yeah we have young nieces that would probably really enjoy playing this...but, how often is it really going to hit the table?? Good news is that it is small, and easy to stick on the shelf...with many more games in my collection ready for goodwill way before this one. Thank you Santa!!

This is puzzley bingo. There is a pattern of face-down tiles you are trying to make to call bingo. After a tile has been called and flipped over, everyone MUST shift an entire row or column of their board.

I think I would get tired of the game if I played it TOO often but the puzzle experience with a dash of luck was a lot of fun.

This game is a ton of fun for people who want a relaxing gaming experience with the family or just to play for an evening of fun over a cup of hot cocoa or coffee. The game itself is simple at its core, with a sort of "Bingo" seeming core to it. 

However, it is far more than just a "Bingo clone!" Imagine one of those classic sliding picture puzzles, but where the you are also trying to insert your pieces to obtain a "Bingo" and you have the core idea a little better, but not entirely. The game comes with multiple ways to throw wrenches into your plans, and has built-in ways to make the game playable with a group that includes both children and adults by providing some handicappers. These can also be used with a group of just adults or older kids to play a much more challenging variant of the game! 

Moreover, the artwork is fantastic, and the game can be played in as many rounds as you like so you have a ton of play options right out of the box. 

My son and wife give this a 10 because they love it and it is still competitive for me as well. If they're willing to play it at will, then it's a 10 for me because I'll play it all the time!

RATING: 9
A delightful problem-solving game without player interaction, which means it works just as well as a game of solitaire puzzling as it does as a competitive game. With straightforward turns and themes of matching and spacial reasoning, it's a great game for kids to play with adults - it's easy to handicap, make alternate rules, or cooperate.

The gameplay is effectively Bingo crossed with a 15-16 puzzle or Rubik's cube, where you can reposition your desired tiles (those with an Animal turned face-up) by sliding a new tile into a row (causing another tile to fall out, to be added again next turn). 

It also comes with a surprising amount of variant depth with just a few extra tokens, which make for anti-bingo blocking and variant, non-matching animals.

Game components are of a high quality (perhaps the dream cards could have been heavier, but the punch-outs are of a satisfying weight and finish) and all of the art is lovely.

I'm very happy to have backed this on Kickstarter!

KS edition includes Honeypot Ants, a 5th animal tile for play with five players, and Dream Companions. The dream companions are a few bonus tiles with rare animals on them for Dingo's Dreams. When playing with this variant, each player starts with one of these extra tiles in hand. To win the game, a player's dream companion tile must be in the center space of the dreamscape, in addition to all other normal goal requirements.

It's a multiplayer solitaire as everybody is puzzling on it's own and there is no player interaction at all. You also need a dose of luck, but then again you need that in every Bingo-game :-) But it's enjoyable and it only takes 15 minutes to play, so a nice filler.

RATING: 6
simple game that combines configurable pattern matching and bingo. Each player has a grid of 25 location tiles. There is a card that indicates the victory positions for tile backs. Each round a location is drawn from a deck of cards, and each player flips that location over, then they slide one of their rows or columns one position up/down/left/right. The first player to have each indicated position occupied by a face-down location tile wins.

Not strategically deep, but thanks in part to Ryan Laukat's artwork it's more enjoyable than it probably should be. Good quick time filler.

In this game, you get a personal grid of tiles and one tile to your hand. A goal card is flipped and players need to try to get their boards to match the pattern. Each turn a tile flips to the pattern matching side, and then players have to take the tile in their hand, and move it into one of the rows, sliding the tiles over and kicking out the tile on the other end, which then becomes your hand for the next turn. In this way, players continue manipulating boards until someone wins. The game is ok, sort of bingoish, but I was having trouble visualizing the pattern on my board. The not acceptable pattern side is a landscape picture, and the acceptable pattern side is an animal, so you'd imagine that would be easy to differentiate, but in fact the tonality of them is quite similar, which made it hard to see one without seeing the other. I think this is going to be a pass for me.

I hoped it would be a good game to play with my son who loves all kinds of puzzle games, Rubiks cubes etc.
However, After the first game (three rounds) my son and me are unanimous on this one - its a four. Whatever the other players do has no effect on what you can do with your puzzle, there is no interaction. And the Puzzle is not so interesting and somehow random. Even my son thinks there is no fun playing this one.
But he wants to test hazards so until then its stays in the collection.

The game has absolutely zero interaction.  There is not event pacing pressure based on how close someone else is to winning -- knowing someone else's position has NO impact what-so-ever on your own behavior.  NONE.  People claim dominion has no interaction, but there is timing pressure there.  Here, there is truly no interaction.

The game is mechanical and a bit random.  Sometimes the tile you need randomly flips into place.  Most of the time, you make the obvious push to get close to the goal pattern.  It might be an interesting puzzle for children, but there are no choices -- just calculations plus luck.  However, young kids who can't do the spatial planning are likely to just get frustrated.

The advanced rules with hazards just make things worse.  They actually remove the guarantee that the game will actually end, and simply add more randomness to what may happen each turn.

The art is pretty, but it's too small to appreciate on the tiles, and ends up just making things look cluttered and hard to visually process.  So, despite being nice, it actually detracts from the game's playability.

All in all, the game has nothing what-so-ever to keep me engaged.

This game features Ryan Laukat's beautiful artwork while having been designed by Alf Seegert.

Bought this game for a couple reasons 1. I am Australian, so it seemed natural I should own it. 2. I live in Salt Lake and the artist was a Salt Lake local, so I wanted to support them. This game is great if you've got a few minutes to play and don't want to set up anything complicated. You've got a few tiles and some cards to draw from. It is IMO a good variant on bingo that has options to make it more difficult or a longer play if wanted. Some strategy involved, but not complicated. Will play again.

Obtained from Origins 2017 from the Red Raven Games booth.  Had first play on 7/9/17.  I provided my own baggies for the box as the game did not have any.  

Good game.  Puzzly.  Reminds me of bingo and tic-tac-toe combined together.  Beautiful artwork by Ryan Laukat.  Great with all ages of players.  The basic game can be very easy.  Can be made more complex by adding hazard tiles.  It's solitaire-like, so those looking for player interaction won't find it in this game.

By design, it's incredibly fiddly. Every round you have to slide a whole row of tiles that are part of a grid.

The gameplay is just trying to get certain tiles to be in certain positions. Similar to Bingo, it feels like everyone will be really close but then one person will win because the right tile happened to get flipped.

It's not terrible but I wouldn't suggest it. Of the modern Bingo-style games, I would prefer Karuba, Avenue, and even Take it Easy.

RATING: 4
DD has some elements of Bingo, namely calling out landscapes and flipping over a tile. The comparison stops there. By further sliding tiles around in a grid, players try to fulfill specific objectives on their 5x5 tile grid. Hazards add another spatial challenge where places with hazard markers cannot have flipped tiles. 

The game is challenging when combined with hazards. It turns out that as more and more tiles get flipped, the objective simply becomes making sure the hazard conditions are fulfilled. It is tough. The several games we played resulted in total failure for both parties. As the board gets crowded with flipped tiles, it is quite a spatial challenge to ensure all the hazard zones are empty. I am not sure if the authors intended to have that effect as in fulfilling the dreamscape becomes a secondary feature of escaping the hazards.

It is also hard for me to visualize making the dreamscape well in the earlier half of the game. I am mainly just pushing tiles around in the beginning until half the board is filled up before I try fulfilling the dreamscape conditions. Perhaps there is a better way to plan earlier on but I just cannot see it easily.

The game is ok. As this is a multiplayer solitaire game, it is a race to the finish line. I don't mind playing DD just as I don't mind letting it go.

Excellent game for bringing people into the hobby. The bingo mechanic is familiar enough that everyone gets it pretty quickly but the added puzzle-ability during the walkabout phase is an excellent little taste of board gaming.

An easy game to play for 2-4 players. It is almost like bingo, but with an added twist allowing you to slide an extra tile into the mix to help you arrange your board into the required pattern.  Easy to learn, kids seem to be able to pick it up fairly easy.  There's some extra pieces to raise the skill level, but we haven't tried those yet.

Lovely, simple game that you could technically play with an entire room full of people if you have enough copies. It's Bingo but better, and it will entertain you. It is especially good with newbies.

Not sure if it's a must-have, though. It doesn't shine too much to me, except conceptually.

A clever little puzzle game that looks good. A fair amount of luck can spoil a well worked out planned maneover but it only last 5 to 10 minutes so you will no doubt want to give it another go. Nice.

Family bingo variant. Be the first dingo or koala to replicate a random pattern objective on a modular 5 X 5 grid. Flip a tile matching the color/terrain cards. Next, push a 26th tile onto the grid at a desired row or column forcing out the next 26th tile. Repeat until victory. Has a Rubik cube element where you get parts of the pattern built but you have to break it to add final pieces of the puzzle. Has advanced obstacles for more diffulty.

Didn't really care for it but it has some redeeming values. You are manipulating a 5x5 grid of tiles to form the pattern needed. It is a little puzzle and takes some thought. It is probably a good family game for kids and adults.

Kickstarted this game. Bingo with a twist. Just played for the first time with my 7yo daughter and she gave it a B+. She began to get bored/frustrated during our third game because we picked a more difficult, time-consuming pattern. Difficulty scales easily from quick 10 minute game (with setup) to 20+ minutes for the more difficult patterns.

Finally got to play this having owned it for years and  played home brew Celebrities for 20+ years.

It was fun. A mix of Charades, Pictionary and Celebrities, but not restricted to celebrities. I'd been under the impression it was almost the same game, but it wasn't.

Slightly annoyed to find out that my "UK" edition has American words in it.

Party game, great fun with the right people.  It's similar to charades, but the cycling card deck mitigates difficult clues, and the short time keeps things fun.

This entry is standing in for Time's Up! and all of its variants.  At my family cottage we play a version we called Salad Bowl and I had no idea this was an actual designer game until recently.  

I think this is best played with each player simply writing down half a dozen or so items on scraps of paper.  This means that everyone will get the references and it personalizes every game, leading to inside jokes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I enjoy this, but, to describe its relative merits in the Party Game World, I'd say it's about level with Scattegories, a little better than Articulate and not as good as Apples to Apples or Cranium.

I found that too many of the cards were very obscure to English ears (this isn't supposed to matter but it does - it puts some new players off - just how many times can you attempt to play a card of someone you've never heard of before that gets frustrating?), but I did weed those out and I know there are extra cards to buy, so, in the end, that doesn't worry me too much.  Also, I don't think 30 seconds is enough per round - esp if you have some harder cards in there.  I think it may be fun with 1 min per side per round, and I may try that.

Party games generally fall in one of two categories: 
Either players are racing against a clock to do somthing difficult (like charades, Pictionary or Taboo) or they have to be creative with an answer to a situation (Balderdash, Scruples). I would consider this to be the best of the first category (tied with Taboo, which is a little less fun but also shorter and simpler). This plays like Taboo in the first round, but then there are 2 more rounds, with each one getting progressively more restrictive. It's absolutely hilarious, and the 3 round system really has a way of evening out the playing field (games like this often are dominated by players who know a lot of trivia, but playing three rounds with the same cards makes it easier for everyone to get involved)

After reading the rules four times over three years, I finally got it to the table.  It truly is one of the greatest party games ever (and better than the rules read).  Seems like it would play better with mixed teams.  A team of close relatives seems pretty lethal.

RATING: 6.5
I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

As someone who doesn't particularly enjoy party games, I must admit that I liked Time's Up quite a bit. True, it's basically charades but the game put a nice little twist on that basic idea. It's still a familiar concept that only needs a couple of minutes to be explained and it's still easy to play, but it spices things up just enough to make it better.

On the other hand, as fat as I've see so far, the game doesn't create so many hilarious moments like other party games do, but it's definitively entertaining and it makes for a good team vs team game. I will gladly play this one again when I'll have the chance.

solid party game.  i'm fairly tired of werewolf and apples to apples, good as it initially was to me, became stale pretty quickly once the cards started repeating.  i'm not excited about repeats here but they do seem to be funnier because of past and often bad clues.  the deluxe version has more cards, a huge box, and a timer.  i think that title recall is much better on content and has a smaller box to boot, so recommending that one.  the core game of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity_(game) is also very playable.

- The last two, not so much. It becomes an exercise of memory which isn't what I wanted in the game.

RATING: 5
For fans of party games this may be a great choice, but if party games are not your thing, be aware that this game can take a long time to finish if played by a large group.  The game depends on knowing (or remembering) various names and guessing them based on successively less and less clues.  A fun concept, but if you don't know the famous persons or the group suffers from short term amnesia - it may be easier to simply pass out the beer and gossip about the people everyone does knows.

This game is just like Fishbowl or Celebrities.  I like Fishbowl/Celebreties much better because it is free and the replayability is huge because people choose their own celebrities and not those found on printed cards already.

This is the place holder for Fishbowl since they are exactly the same.  One of the best party games out there.

Party Game en el que los jugadores se dividen por equipos. Consiste en hacer que los miembros de tu equipo adivinen personajes. 
el juego se desarrolla en tres fases. En la primera, no se puede pasar, y debes explicar lo mejor que puedas quién es el personaje que aparece en tu carta. En la segunda fase, el sistema es idéntico, pero solo puede usarse una sola palabra para describir al personaje. En la tercera fase, se utiliza la mímica. 

En  todas las fases se utiliza el mismo mazo de cartas con personajes. Cada fase finaliza cuando el mazo se ha acabado (es decir, todos los personajes han sido adivinados). 

Es un juego muy, muy divertido. Recomendable.. especialmente para grupos de tamaño medio-grande.

This game works well with many different types of groups.  Better than most Party Trivia games.  You need to be there for the whole game, as the last round can get very difficult if you missed out on some humorous play from earlier in the game that helps people make up an easy action for later rounds.  Much fun.  My wife and I want to become the experts of this game and take everyone down.

Hilarious. Best party game by a mile. 

Almost all party games have you doing the same thing repeatedly, but the way this game builds from simple clue giving to charades is brilliant. Since the names are used multiple times in the initial rounds, the charades are less intimidating than they normally would be, so even shy people enjoy the game. 

Endless replayability - just make up your own names.

Pretty darned fun as party games go.  The funniest part is that clues that are totally wrong will often be remembered and used later in the game, which leads to good inside jokes years later.  Cards are mostly Americana and literature which could throw off foreigners & young ones.

RATING: 8
One of my favorite party games---every game produces hilarious memories. They took elements from other games (charades, celebrity, password) and wove together a true classic. My only complaint is that the first round can be tough for less knowledgeable participants and I've seen them turned off because they get embarassed when people say they are dumb for not knowing an otherwise famous individual from history or literature (i.e. avoid playing with sensitive dumb people).

Update: Oh no!!! I had to drop my rating because the students I play with do not know enough of the people in the game. And now there is TIME'S UP - TITLE RECALL! What a great new way to play with songs and movies and book titles. How dare they make improvements! TITLE RECALL IS EVEN BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL!

UPDATE 01/09
I just love this game and I often use the game structure in training exercises and lessons I teach. I used this structure for my 'final exam' in a class on board games I had the pleasure of teaching 12 amazing students recently. I used gaming concepts instead of people and we all shared a good laugh together.

RATING: 8
Don't be scared from this one because you don't know celebrities.  By the second round, half of the clues have nothing to do with the actual celebrity, but with the clues that did (or didn't work) in the first round.  My favorite moment was when my teammate got "Jim Carrey" in round 3 instantly when all I did was make a face. :-)  This game falls flat with people who aren't quick at giving clues.  It doesn't fall flat with people who don't know celebrity names -- one can pick up the names easily enough by playing -- just with people who can't think on their feet.

This is just a trivia game but the repeating of the questions (three rounds of the same cards) adds to the pain (can help with the right partners).  I will say that if you have the right people this becomes fun for everyone (even those losing), the the score could be higher.

Displaces Apples to Apples as my favorite "party game".  My dad was even really into it and laughing...and he hates games.  One of the clever things about this game is the way it slowly pulls you into the pantomiming section.  The "stage fright" or shyness some people feel during party games  where you have to perform is overcome gradually and painlessly.

Fun party game in which players are paired.  Cards are passed around clockwise.  When you're holding the cards, you decide which you think you can act out or hint at well enough for your partner to guess.  Successful guesses are placed in front of you.  There is a set amount of time in which you're allowed to hint/guess as many as you can.  The interesting part is that the same set of cards is being passed among all players so you've got all the hints that came before.  As rounds are played, players are allowed to use fewer and fewer mechanics to hint, finally not being allowed to speak at all.

This game always seems to be just on the edge of out-staying its welcome. I find it works a bit better if you deal more "extra" cards to allow more discards, to get rid of any names that are unknown to the group. And playing with a few less than 40 cards helps keep the length down.

Great party game of trying to get your partner/teammates to guess the names of celebrities, historical figures, fictional characters, etc.  The second round tends to be the easiest and fastest, as everyone "knows" all the answers and each clue is only one word.  If you are truly in tune with your partner/team, it's really great to just zip through the cards!

Wow this game is fun.  We had a little trouble with some of the names (and it could be better or worse for you), but in the following rounds the hard names that some of the people didn't know made the game even funnier.

This game needs teams to be evenly matched.  In a game where my wife and I were matched up it really threw the game off because no one had anything to work on in the second and third round on the names that they didn't know.  We knew a lot more than them.  Despite that it was still one of the funniest gaming experiences I have had.

Time's Up is the same game as the public domain name Celebrities, only instead of players writing all the names on slips of paper, Time's Up provides cards with names on them.  Celebrities is a fantastic game, but the game is significantly less fun (for me) with the pre-determined names.

Components: Readable cards, and a nice scorepad, but really nothing special. The Deluxe Edition has a timer, which is very helpful because the person watching the time is often engrossed in the clue giving and forgets to call out time.

Not nearly as much fun when created on the fly by the players themselves. The obscurity of names in the published version, and the deliberate overlap, make the game much more challenging than when players come up with names/objects themselves.

Experience: Very exciting. It's enjoyable developing codes for names, and racing against the other team to pantomime the more difficult celebrities from the dwindling deck. Even unknown names can eventually be guessed, as root-word codes are developed and as the same card circulates among all the players. I love the fact that we cycle through the deck three times; it allows time to build special game relationships with each of the names, making each game distinctly memorable. The cards also seem to be deliberately ordered to allow for ambiguity (e.g. clumping together people with similar names or occupations). This game is awesome every time.

The game celebrities is one of the best party games out there.  Time's up is that without having to make your own celebrity lists.  I say "having to", but I mean "getting to", because I enjoy that.

Time's Up! is a party game for teams of two or more players (best with teams of two). The same set of famous names is used for each of three rounds. In each round, one member of a team tries to get his teammates to guess as many names as possible in 30 seconds. In round 1, almost any kind of clue is allowed. In round 2 no more than one word can be used in each clue (but unlimited sounds and gestures are permitted). In round 3, no words are allowed at all.

The highlight last play was a buddy of mine trying to describe "Mikail Berishnikov" in stage 3 by dancing around like a ballerina.

The best "social/party game" I've ever played. It has clever gameplay calling players to think and act in a variety of styles. And you'll learn about some people you haven't heard of every time you play.
The best feature of the game is the fiendishly well-chosen array of names. In any given block of 40 cards you draw to play the game with, you're sure to get several "pairs" or "trios" of names that can somehow be perfectly described by the same one-word clue or charade. Your partner is miming his ear missing -- is it "Evander Holyfield" or "Vincent Van Gogh?" Does the clue "Disney" refer to "Mickey Mouse," "Minnie Mouse," or "Goofy?" You have to think carefully to navigate around these clever traps laid by the designers.

And you'll have loads of laughs every time you play.

I stopped short of a 10 rating on this one because I like the "public domain" rules that I was introduced to better than the official rules.  It's totally brutal to only get one guess in the third round.  We had people passing 20 times in a row, 'cause they knew there was no chance to give a "one guess" performance.  I say let them have as many guesses as they want during the "charades" portion.  It evens out in the end, with teams still managing to spend the entire 3 seconds on 1 or two cards, but without all the passing.

This is one of those games where you don't really need the game, just to know the rules.  (An enthusiastic group could just make up its own list of personalities before beginning.)  Nonetheless, the game is great fun: a sort of charades/password combination.  Since the same answers are used in the three rounds, memory becomes as important as trivia knowledge and acting ability.  A great way to keep a group entertained!

[Verbal/Non-verbal Communication-based Party Game, Celebrities] [8P:8] A prepackaged take on the Celebrities/Charades public domain game. Time's Up incorporates shared learning - the same set of 40 names are put up for identification 3 times. First time, verbal and non-verbal cues are valid. All names are read (and identified if necessary) after the first round. Second time, a single word is the only verbal cue allowed. Finally, the third time only non-verbal clues and non-word sounds are permitted. The difficulty people have identifying known names once verbal explanations are omitted is testament to our reliance on spoken language to communicate. Very good for the right crowd (i.e., people who are happy to act out and who have some familiarity with personalities). A wide range of personages are represented, from history to sports to pop culture. Expect to not recognize a few names each game, maybe more than that if you're not American or you eschew pop culture. The publisher offers blank cards so you can add your own personages to the game. (Of course, my gaming group added ourselves, along with the house rule that you can't *point* at someone to identify him/her. Hilarious.)

This is a fun game, but a more Euro-phile version would have left us with more options as some of the names were unfamiliar to us. We laughed a LOT when playing this. Suitable for older children and silly adults.

Hard to think of a better party game. It's a knowledge-cum-memory-cum-expression game and will appeal to almost everybody. Moreover, it naturally creates a great ambiance since a funny answer will necessarily come back later in the game since it creates a great way to remember a difficult character. Finally, everybody is playing all the time because players constantly have to remember which cards have been played.

This could be the best (or tied for the best) party game I've ever played. I don't like charades and I don't like password but this game has both of those elements and they work here.

RATING: 4
Typical party game. It can be interesting to watch how the former rounds inform the words and charades used in the later rounds. On the other hand it's trivia again, and with people who don't know much about the subject matter it's a rather pointless exercise.

I&#039;m not into party games, so that affects this rating. It isn&#039;t bad, but I found it a bit of a problem to decide how to best play it with 10 - 5 couples or two teams of five. 
Anyway - it&#039;s a party game. Just a party game. Just a-n-o-t-h-e-r party game. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s any more fun than any of the other party games I&#039;ve been forced to play. I&#039;ll leave it at that.

The one and only time I brought this out to play, I was booed!

UPDATE: Finally played it with the right crowd snd it was very funny. alas, the names on the cards could do with an update, but a great party game (Rating 7.583, March 15) - stored with Title Recall.

Fun party game that is like a warm-up to charades, where players must identify various real and imaginary people.  It seems like this could be a good educational game, combining repetition (each name appears in three different rounds, and in each round keeps reappearing until properly guessed) with lots of laughter.

A great party game.  The game gets more challenging as the rounds are played.  The unique part of it is that you use the same cards for all three rounds so everone knows all the answers as the game gets more difficult.  The way you give the clues changes for each round.  Fun and engaging.

I don't pay nearly enough attention to popular culture to be any good at this, but I can at least derive some entertainment from watching other people embarrass themselves during their turns. I'm not much for "party" games, though if forced to play one, Times Up! is one of the less objectionable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Delightful!  If you have *any* interest in party games, this is one you'll want to own.  It does need an affable group of players who aren't afraid to make fools of themselves.

The rules are extremely well conceived.  Time's Up is played over three rounds, with the same celebrities appearing in each round.  In the first round, pretty much anything goes, and the clues are usually mostly verbal a la Taboo.  The second round is play acting with any number of sounds but only one spoken word, although it may be repeated.  The third round is the same but with no words at all.  There are a couple of other rules, but that's basically the game.

The cards included definitely cater to the brainy and/or literate or historically aware sort of player.  But you don't need to know all the celebrities so long as you're not afraid of looking like a cretin.  In fact some of the game's most hilarious moments arise from such ignorance.  If you want to play with a younger or less "erudite" group, or if you just prefer more of a pop culture slant, it would be a trivial task to have the players submit their own celebrities.  And if some of you hyperliterate dorks out there want to move the game in the other direction, I've heard that the celebrities chosen for the expansion decks are more obscure.

Great party game.  One thing that I like a lot is that while it initially depends on your knowledge of various historical and pop culture figures, by the time the second and third rounds roll around, it's more important to "get in sync" with your teammate(s) and observe how the others play.  So, it's not devastating if you don't even know who Stonewall Jackson or Sugar Ray Leonard are; by the end, it won't matter.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a great party game that combines elements from several of the more popular standards. Playing in teams of two, it's also fun to use other people's clues for the same answer. I have one caveat that I say every time I teach it, though: almost inevitably, people hate this game after the first round, but love it by the end of the third. Stick with it!

One of the best party games I have played.  Combination of password, charades, and a memory game.  Lots of fun and definitely going to be purchased.  Huge advantage to teams that are similar age, education, and interests, so watch how you pair people! Only complaint is the "learnability" of the deck and the aforementioned advantage for people of similar ages/education/etc.  I also think the game takes a little too long, but various house rules can take care of a lot of these problems.  I'd love to see an expansion with people from the 80's, 90's, and 00's for the younger crowd.

A good party game.  Played in three rounds; first round you are allowed to give as many clues as possible in order to have your team guess the word/personality.  In the second round, you can only give 1 clue (then again you should know which cards are in the play deck).  Third round you cannot speak, but must act out what's on the card.  Can get hillarious.

Fun and fast charades-like (but not really) game with increasing difficulty requirements to describe the things you are try to get folks to guess. It's just fun to watch and I laugh a lot during it. My rub with it is the partnerships. It would work for me more if there was a way to mix things up so that an imbalanced split of teams wouldn't be so harsh (and believe me, I'm one of the weak links).

Fun and challenging party game, where the rounds become more challenging as you go.

It doesn't require the kind of creativity you need for some of the party games my group has been playing a lot (Say Anything and Cluzzle), which is a relief for uncreative me.  It's very funny and highly interactive, with answers building from what other groups have done.  It also has the advantages of being easy to understand, highly accessible and playable by any number of people.  If I owned it, it would likely be my choice of party games. (1 play)

Rating applies to this as a party game not as a 'gamesclub' game.  

If you don't want to buy it, just get a thirty second timer; hand out some blank cards to those playing; ask them to make up some famous people/animals; then shuffle the lot together and start playing.  Has the advantage of being customisable to the country you are in, and to the age group of those you are playing it with.  It doesn't even matter if the same famous person/animal gets entered more than once.

Once upon a time, I thought party games were kind of stupid and pointless. I’m glad I changed my mind (thanks to Dixit) and got to play Time´s Up. It’s a great great party game, and it´s in my top 10 games of all time. 

Easy to teach, doesn’t take long to play.  I love everything of this game; the only problem is that many gamers in my country don’t know who the people on the cards are so I prefer to play Tittle Recall over this one.  

Totally recommended.

Like all party games, this one also comes with the "good with the right group" caveat.  Because I do indeed have the "right group" of friends to play this with, I have never laughed so hard or had so much fun playing a party game (or arguably any other game in my collection, for that matter).  This game is definitely less about winning and much, much more about the ridiculousness that ensues on the way.  I'd give this game an 11 if I could.

RATING: 3
Wow, pantomime at its finest, or not, wholly depending on the group.  This game is absolutely stupid without decent actors or a basic knowledge of the things players are trying to guess.  I really don't get the love for this game on BGG.

RATING: 9.5
Gameplay inevitably results in much merriment and laughter, and usually some moments that are remembered for a long time afterwards ("George Steinhamburger", Russ confusing Betty White with Aphrodite, etc.). Only fails to score a 10 because I have a hard time getting other people to play it sometimes.

Great party game...one of the best out there...don't need the game to play - just have everyone write down 3 names of people at least a couple other people in the room would know and have those names mixed up in a hat and proceed with play.

RATING: 7
Very cute party game.  Like all trivia games, it suffers somewhat from the fact that it works best when people are all equally familiar with the material.  I enjoy the struggle to convey the idea as creatively and swiftly as possible -- it's not as interesting when one group just knows more of the names than others.  The boxed version is by no means necessary but it is convenient.

Huh?  This is just the commercial version of Celebrities, the amazing party game that you can create yourself anew each time for the cost of 50 slips of paper and a pencil.  The public domain version is also much better for the fact that the people's names (or just words and phrases -- the game also works well that way) come from your and your friend's own imaginations.  Therefore, the commercial version is actually worse, for limiting the infinite space of the free version to the 500 names that some guy decided to print up on card stock.  Thumbs down to this turkey.

RATING: 8
One of my favorite party games, I played the low tech version of this where you wrote names on pieces of paper and drew them out of a hat before doing them for your team. It was a beach time family tradition, one that got better and better the older everyone got. I'll always remember the time that Duncan only put obscure German scientists. Jerk.

But seriously, the boxed version is great because there *should* be at least 2 people on a team of 3 or 4 that know who most of the people or titles are. I have both the regular and title versions, and I'm not totally sure which is my favorite.

Have also played the Title Recall version. I liked that one better, but this still gave some good laughs. Our main trouble was not knowing the people (all the answers are people). Somehow that was less of an issue with the titles. Perhaps it is there is something more evocative in a title of a movie, even if you don't know that movie, whereas a name is just a series of letters stuck together.

So this was OK but we'd take Title Recall over it.

Ce sont des personnages célèbres qu'il faut faire retrouver à son partenaire, et ce lors de 3 manches consécutives. 

La 1ère manche est assez classique, il suffit simplement d'en faire passer le plus possible le temps d’un sablier. On mélange ensuite les personnages présentés, et on recommence… mais on ne dispose plus cette fois que d'un mot pour chaque personnage, ce qui oblige à bien retenir ce qui s'est dit lors de la 1ère manche. Vient ensuite une 3ème manche, toujours avec les mêmes personnages, mais pour laquelle on ne peut que mimer

In this game you have to guess the exact name of several famous people. You only play with a subset of all the cards.

There are three rounds and each rouns is finished when ALL cards have been guessed.

In the first round you make a description, in the second you only say a single word and in the third you make mimics.

We tried this first with a large group of teens and it just didn't work - they were too flustered at not immediately recognizing many of the names.

Rating is for game with rules.  The cards are genius and perfect for a stripped down version of the game.  I HATE the limitations on clues in the three rounds thing and the timer is WAY too fast.

Just grab a stack of cards per team and make what time per round you like.  Go till the stacks are done with whatever clues you want.  Oh, and plenty of beer / wine / whiskey.  It's supposed to be a party game and the rules as written are just too difficult.

I know I'll be in the minority here but there it is.

Everyone gets dealt cards and a partner.  Goal is to get your partner to guess the word/words on your card without saying the words.  First round you cannot pass if the card is hard but you can pretty much do anything to get your partner to guess the card besides saying the words on the card.  Second round you only can use one word to get your partner to guess the card but you now can pass to the next card if the one you have is tough.  Third round = pantomime.  Every round you are re-using the same cards from previous rounds so everyone is familiar with the cards by the end of the game.  

Good fun.

This game is light as air, dumb as a brick, and fun as hell.  With the right group (enthusiastic folks who don't give a toss how weird their 'charading' can get) and only occasional play (not a ton of names = folks may develop a shorthand with repeated play), this is aces.

Piacevolissimo party game. Si tratta di far indovinare i nomi sulle carte in possesso, ci si divide in 2 squadre e via di risate, clessidre e accuse. Gioco che si ripete in 3/4 mani sempre più impegnativi, si parte dalla descrizione completa, al riferimento utilizzando solo 1 parola, al mimo, alla fotografia. Gioco che nel nostro gruppo regla sempre grasse risate e amicizie vacillare.

Love this game! Perfect for any setting and with any number of people, Time's Up is a fantastic game that incorporates so many of the Great Party Games into one. And it seems to balance out players who feel they might not know as many pop culture clues as others. This game requires many skills to be great: nonverbal communication (obviously) and memory. Time's Up is a game that revitalizes the party!

We bought it for my youngest daughter's birthday.

Surprisingly good. Generates a lot of excitement with the kids. Good replayability. Good engagement of kids and adults.

Needs good reading skills for the cards else you have to pair up into teams to allow the younger kids to have someone do the reading for them (else have a 'reading helper' for all of those who need one).

The only problem is that depending on who you play with, many people may not know all the people/characters on the cards. Once that is out of the way, just ensure to play with enough cards that people cannot simply memorize which cards were used, since the second and third rounds become too easy.

Excellent party game with an increasing level of silliness.  As the clues you are allowed to give decreases (round 1, as much as you want; round 2, only one clue; round 3, none!) the hilarious pantomimes take over.  Enjoyable by most even if party games aren't their cup of tea!

Don't know why I didn't mark this game as I played it in winter 2008 once.
It was really hard since I knew only some of those celebrities included in this game. We had to go through them a great many times.

A nice idea in this game though. Works almost perfectly as a party game. Brave guests needed though.

Don't get me wrong, there was fun included too!

Great taboo-like game.  Some of the characters are pretty easy, but others can be hard to even know who they are.  The fact that you have to work through the same deck three times, but each time with fewer verbal clues, makes it a lot of fun trying to get non-verbal ways to explain the same ideas.  Good game for anyone who's not a total introvert.

RATING: 6
Time's Up has all the typical comedy associated with charades, but several elements in the design makes it superior to that traditional game. The increased pressure on your partner is not only due to the time limit, but also only one guess is allowed and if you're wrong, the opposing teams may get the answer in their turn. Not only that, ambiguous mimes such as machine gun fire can deny your team points if Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola are in the same deck; this leads to some frustration. Some may find the game play a little repetitive and I always play with no more than 24 personalities to keep the game acceptable short. Great fun with those who lose their inhibitions.

Not much of a 'party game' player myself this game at least does what it's supposed to do quite well. Much better than Apples to Apples, in theory, but not as good as Wise or Otherwise. The required 'acting' (think Charades) really puts me off. Probably rewards older players and people with good memories too much to be 'balanced'; but this is a game about socializing, not winning. Having spouses for partners may be a bad idea.

This is far and away my favorite party game, possibly favorite game in general.  What can I say, it's simple, it's fun, it handles large groups nicely, it's a lot of things that I love about gaming.  If you want to get a group of people together and laughing, then this is the game to go to.  

I've just started to play to the point where some of the cards are repeated for me, and it hasn't been detrimental to the game at all, there are just *SO* many names, that you don't realize it is a repeat until after someone got the name, and at that point, any advantage at having memorized that card is equalized.

I know this is just a boxed version of a popular parlor game (Names, Celebrity, it has several incarnations) but I truly believe that having the cards premade, and having a wide variety to the names goes a long way towards the enjoyment of the game.  I played with a group before where they just made their own cards and it just wasn't as fun.  The oddball cards are often the most enjoyable aspects of the game!

A riff off of the games "Celebrities," Time's Up perfects a list of names allowing you to focus on the fun part of the game - being clever and / or silly to get your partner to guess a person.  A person with a quick memory for the forty famous people involved in a game will have a slight advantage, but regardless this is a great game.  The varied list make it a good party game for intergenerational gatherings, as well.  Great party game.

RATING: 7
Based on one play.  Charades-like game, but at the same time quite a different feel than charades--more like a language-inventing game.  As the game progresses, your ability to communicate decreases, and so a shorthand is developed (in the form of gestures and sound effects) to describe a concept as complex as, say, Tori Spelling.  The most amazing this is that, due to how the game works, it is very very possible to get someone to say "Tori Spelling" by making a simple hand gesture.  It's very satisfying to pull off such a feat.  But my description is like someone trying to explain a great joke--the joke itself is funny at a gut level, and analysis won't give you the right sense of it at all.  Never mind what I say--game is full of laughs.  

Again, this review is based on one play--I'm going to guess that there's a 1-game learning curve to this, when played with a group of complete newbies.  The disconnect between rounds 2 (being able to say only one word) and 3 (saying no words) was much sharper than I believe it should be in our game.  People made no effort to do any gestures in Round 2.  Almost like password, the cluegiver would say something like, "Author", and the guesser would immediately respond with something like "Kurt Vonnegut?" without giving the cluegiver a chance to mime anything.  Not only was this a detriment to player's scores, it was a detriment to the fun of the game, because it made Round 3 that much more disconnected and difficult.  I'm sure that if we had a group of people where at least 25% had played once, the game would have been much smoother and interesting.  Still, it was fun and full of laughs--just a bit too long as people floundered in the last round. 

I ended up buying an expansion set + a 30 second timer instead of the full game.  Saved 5 dollars or so with no loss of functionality.

There are so many elements of this that are just amazingly well-crafted.  Though perhaps not noticable to the casual observer, a close examination reveals that this game was the work of an expert.  The difference in gameplay quality between this and, say, Cranium is immense.  And it's a lot of fun, too!

I'm not a huge party game fan, but this one works out OK most times.  I like the funny moments when an odd gesture or word gets associated with one of the names and comes back later as an "obvious" clue for something: How the heck does flapping your arms like a bird instantly evoke the name of Pythagoras?  Sometimes, that happens in this game.

I don't get the love of this game - it takes the traditional Outburst/Taboo/Charades-type party game and turns it into more of a Memory game, where the winning team is the best at remembering previous answers and paying attention to which ones other teams have already taken.  It gets more boring at the end of each round as teams are trying to complete the most difficult answers that everyone's passed, but eventually players are trying to guess words they just saw a moment ago.  And if teams are actually trying to win, since you're adding up 3 rounds, one team may be hopelessly behind after the first round and is just going through the motions the 2nd and 3rd round to appease the leading teams.

Az Activity "testvére", de amiben sokkal jobb nála, hogy nem kell hozzá semmi csak papír és ceruza, no meg a játékosok határtalan kreativitása.

Ha vagyunk legalább (hárman) négyen, és nincs a kéznél már társas, de lazulni akarunk, akkor különösen ajánlott.

This is fun! A simple guess-the-famous-person game turned on its heels. A large deck of people cards are distilled down to 40, and these same 40 cards are guessed at over three rounds. Each round continues until all 40 cards are claimed. Rounds consist of 30 second turns, where a cluegiver attempts to convey the celebrity, and the other teammates guess. In round one, any kind of clue, verbal or pantomimed, is legal short of saying the name on the card, saying some nickname, or spelling the name out. No one can pass in round one, you keep guessing and trying until you get it or the timer runs out. In round two, you can use only one word, sound effects, and mime. Since it's one of the 40 people cards you've already seen, it's not all that hard to do. In round three, you can only use sound effects and mime. You get only one guess in rounds 2 and 3, and if it's wrong, you move on to another card. For each round, teams get 1 point for each card claimed. It's really fun by the third round, because players start giving out clues based on previous clues and other players' attempts. Very good party game.

Played at BGG.con '06. Fun party game. I like how they group similar names so that players must find clues to differentiate, say, James Kirk, Jean-Luc Picard, and William Shatner. Or Benjamin Spock and Mr. Spock. Or Billy Dee Williams and Lando Calrissian. I also like how you want to associate something non-verbal into your clues in the early rounds so that in the later rounds you can get the clues without needing to use words (which aren't allowed).

I just upped my rating, this is a really, really fun game!

RATING: 3
I had this game on my wishlist for a REALLY long time based solely on its relative esteem here on BGG.  Given the actual description of the game, I'm really not sure why.  Sure, I knew that it was a party game -- and in general dislike party games.  Unfortunately, this party game uses some of the elements that I find most unpleasant in many games, namely frantic (or semi-frantic) shouting / description / drawing / miming / acting / whatever activity.  I'm amazed that I somehow have gone for years thinking this was a game I would like to try until it was actually described to me.  Say what?  Did I never read the description?  It is what it is and some folks like that (GREAT!).  But I prefer my fun in game playing to come from playing the game and not the behavior of the participants. [03/28/2009] [3]
--------------------------------------------------
I finally got around to actually playing this game.  While it was not as unpleasant as I feared, my overall feelings are spot on.  Like many party games, is really more of an activity than a game.  Nothing wrong with that if it is the activity that you are looking for.  It was actually the activity part that got me to agree to play this.  [12/19/2010]

What a blast! You can be at a disadvantage in the first round, if you're unfamiliar with the names in play, but subsequent rounds are based on communicating names revealed earlier, so the playing field levels.  We mainly play four-player eurogames, but this game makes me wish we had more players more often.

Fantastic party game for gamers and non-gamers alike.  Shy players will have to be cajoled.

RATING: 10
It's reputation as the greatest party game is safe. I really did not know what to expect since I thought Apple to Apples was the best. 
A trivia game about celebrities? Doesn't sound very good. 
Well, within the hour I found myself trying to get my 8 year-old to say "Lawrence of Arabia" without using any words AND SUCCEEDING. It is an evening of laughs for sure. The idea of reusing the same 40 or so names for each round makes it great. Encouraging us to try for "hint" clues like pointing to underwear (HANES) to get a partner to say "Hans Christen Andersen" is what makes it an unforgettable night.

In theory the game works and is 'fun' but it's really quite a drage to to through the three different phases doing the same thing. Two phases would be ok. By the time the third phase comes around, people are just copying previous actions. Also, the game is too 'US' centric. For a party game, it does drag a little long.

In my book, Time's Up has usurped the party game crown previously held by Beyond Balderdash.  The only potential problem is that the famous names are a bit centered in the English speaking world, particularly the USA (although there are plenty of names from world history).  However, this is mitigated by the mechanism that all the answers are known (and can be "researched" using a card list with the rules) after the first round.  Anyway, getting the difficult names provides the lion share of the entertainment.  I can't recommend this game enough.

RATING: 9
This is easily our favorite party game and the one we push when the group moves on to our house.  It's nice to finally have a game that can be fun and involving for more than ten players.  We liked it so much, we've now upgraded to the Deluxe edition.

There was some issue towards the end of a team remembering a name or two and passing until they found it, but frankly, it didn't help them win.

RATING: 8
This is the best party game I've ever played. I laugh so hard I cry when playing this. Playing it is simply hilarious. I can see how people might get frustrated when their partner isn't educated with respect to either art, world history, or pop culture - as the games revolves around charades indicating famous people. But this is part of the game's charm: are you able to communicate the identity on the card even when your partner doesn't have any clue who that person is?

This is one of those games that everyone should have a copy of.

Neveket kell kitalálni három módon. Először mindent használva elmondva, majd csak egy szóval, harmadik körben már csak mutogatva. Egy-egy játékban csak bizonyos számú személy szerepel, ezeket körönként egyre jobban megismerjük ezért a macerásabb szóval kifejezés, mutogatás ténylegesen nem nehezebb csak viccesebb. Nekem nagyon tetszett, jó ötlet az 5 játékos változat. Más, kicsit jobb számomra, mint az Activity, nagyon jó kis partyjáték.

RATING: 4
What am I missing?  The game isn't that bad, but can really be frustrating if you have a partner that doesn't know pop culture or history.  It took forever to go through the first round.  Half the people playing wanted to quit after their 5th attempt to get some cards, by the end of the first round we all wanted it over.  My parter and I destroyed everyone so it wasn't really fun for the other players, and to be honest was mediocre at best for us.  One serious problem with the game is judgement.  No one wants to feel like an idiot, and if you don't know who Mic Jagger, Gwenith Paltrow or Rosa Parks are you are going to feel embarased and ashamed.  Not a real winner in the fun catagory.

The public domain game Celebrities (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/22303) is superior in every way.

A simple party game where you give clues and try to guess the answers under timing.

A fun party game, but less so if you just don't know who these people are! Also, it can go on a bit too long. Still, one of the best party games out there.

--- Summary ---
3 phases: 1. trivia-with-clues --> 2. Password --> 3. Charades.  Pretty fun game, but we kept getting stuck on the first card! Unable to pass, we ended up only scoring 1 point in Phase 1! After that, it becomes a short-term-memory game.

After reading rave reviews from a number of notable game reviewers, I had rather high expectations about how funny and how much fun this game would be.  Those expectations were dashed as soon as I read the rules (and indeed, the group I introduced it to were rather doubtful after hearing them as well), but fortunately we ended up having a pretty fun time when we got down to playing it, and it did get requested the next couple of nights as well.  So while we did enjoy it, my personal opinion is that I can have more fun and laughs from other party games, such as "Beyond Balderdash", "Quip It!", "Why Did the Chicken...?", "Quelf", and "GiftTRAP".  And my edition had several doubles of cards too, which I thought was rather odd.  Game design: 3/5  Personal enjoyment: 3/5  Total: 6/10

Another example of a game I initially read about and thought, "Yuck, not for me!"  Then I played it and loved it from the first moment.  This is one of those party games that ends up with a "gaming story" coming out of it almost every time.  We still have a few pantomines from past games that we bring up occasionally in conversation and they still make us laugh.  Even if you aren't a party gamer, you should at least try this game once.  If you have the right crowd of people, this game is a winner every time.  Highly recommended.

this certainly works as a party game but it's hopelessly unfair to hand the word device to someone when the timer is about to go off. There should be some sort of delay mechanism to make it fair. Also lacking in creativity, this is the game show: Password, essentially.

One of best party games. Interesting that you play all 3 rounds with the same cards. You should remember what cards are in play.

You should play with even numbers of players. Hard to explain a person, when you don`t know who it is.

Edit: The second and third round are very interesting, because you exacly know what characters are in play. But if in the first round there are many characters in play, that nobody know, than the first round takes too long, because you can`t skip a character.

This is a classic party game that takes place in 3 rounds.  The first round is taboo, then you take all the cards and shuffle them up again.  The second round you can only say one word, but you can make gestures and noises.  This would be very hard if you didn't already know who all the possibilities were.  Then you shuffle the cards up again and play charades.

The concept is amusing, particularly because your clues for rounds 2 and 3 often revolve around the previous clues instead of the actual person/thing.  For example, one of the cards was some person from the early 1900's with the first name Carry.  The clue in the taboo round started with Carrie Underwood (from American Idol), so all future clues revolved around American Idol.  It's hard to describe, but it gets everyone engaged and creates some good moment.  The concept alone I would rate a 6.

My problem with this particular game is that the references are mostly literature, history, movie references, and celebrities from the 90's. None of those are really in my wheelhouse, so I had no clue what about 1/3 of the cards were.  It felt like I was playing a version of trivial pursuit that was published in the 80's, making pop culture references I didn't understand.

[b]Fun, amusing concept and party game.  The particularly trivia in this version wasn't for me.[/b]

Time's Up uses three game show mechanisms (Pyramid, Password, and Body Language) with the same sub-deck of cards.  Played three times, the words become more familiar as the communication becomes more limited.  I LOVE Pyramid and HATE charades, so I pretty much just want more of the first round.

Rating is as a party game--vs. other party-based games.  

It is silly, can be obnoxious, and is basically tweaked charades.

Our first game night groups centered around one game - The Name Game, as we called it.  While I do prefer creating names on our own, Time's Up is fantastic for those who don't feel like stumping each other, but just want to get to the "Taboo" and charades elements.  Just about the most fun you can have in a party game, I've been pleasantly surprised to have our new group of meaty-euro fans choose this game time and again as the way to close out the evening.

I certainly prefer this to the Title Recall edition because of the versatility of the individuals in the deck.

Time's Up! was a fun and rowdy experience at BGG.CON. I’d played the party game before, but not the officially produced version.  For those who haven’t played, it’s basically a variant on charades. You have a deck of cards with famous people or characters on them, you split into teams, and you try to get your team to guess as many of the cards as possible in 30 seconds. The key innovation that makes the game interesting is that you play 3 rounds. In the first round, you can say or do anything to get your team to guess the right answer, so it’s fairly easy. In the second round, you play through the same deck of cards again, but this time you can only say one word. It’s much harder, but at least your team has heard all the names before so there’s a memory element to it now. In the third round, you cannot say anything, so it’s purely charades plus sound effects. It can be rather difficult at the end, but there were some very clever people at BGG.CON whose silent acting abilities were impressive. There was one gentleman from Los Angeles, I believe, who was remarkable!

My favorite party game.  It includes a "cheat sheet" in case you don't know the "famous" person.  I like the way you use the same card set each round. Every time we play we end up laughing at least once.  The only thing I would change would be to put the "hints" right on the cards instead of on the sheet. The points don't matter... every game is fun and produces at least one laugh-out-loud moment.

Okay game.  Good for social gathering and a good ice breaker.

(One play) I was surprised by how fun this was even though I only knew half the people being mentioned, due to Americanisms. I think I might try playing Celebrities sometime (and it's free).

Okay party game but depending on how much one reads up on celebrities players are in very different position to win.

GREAT party game, but if you find yourself with a partner that has never heard of Peter Sellars, it could end in a murder-suicide.

RATING: 6
One of the best party games out there.
Does not require the game to play, you can create your own.

[+] works with kids (reading) and non-gamers, simple, plays fast, works with large groups, works with people coming in/dropping out
[-] memory (knowing the cards still in play) can be the wining factor in last round ^^

Sure, it's a great party game, but I still prefer the public domain equivalent, [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/22303/celebrities]Celebrity[/url].  There's no reason to go out and get this one in a box.  I enjoy making your own celebrities more, as well as getting in larger teams to keep people more involved.  If you're the non-creative type who needs the box to feed you the names of celebrities because you can't think of them yourself, then you probably are the non-creative type who won't enjoy the game anyway.

A great little party game that'll keep you laughing the whole time you play it.  Accessible to everyone, even if you don't know who these people are.

many of the more entertaining sessions are still talked about 5, 10 years later.

nice game. The fact that you use the same cards during the 3 roundes, might sound easy, but once you reach the third round, you're glad you at least have an idea about what kind of persons/names are on those cards.
Ideal party game. Can be played with 4 noisy kids in the background ;-)

Family copy. Played it once and I don't think we had the rules quite right and the group wasn't quite into it. I need to try this one again as I think it can be a lot of fun. *Second play 01/02/09* I get it now and the game is very dood if played with the right number and the right age group.

An excellent charades based game which would appeal more with a more UK based set of celebs.

RATING: 7
For a party game, this is one of the best.  The interactivity and the laughs make for a great experience, and the game seems fairly well balanced, mechanically, for a party game.

Always fun to play, and best with a group of 8 or more so you have a thick block of celebrities to work you're way through. Typically the more you play, the better you play since you learn how to use the early rounds to set up clues for later.

Best of all, each playing generates at least one unforgettable moment. Who knew that Garrison Keillor sounded like a donkey braying?

RATING: 7
It's odd, but I'm not sure this really is a great *party* game. It's just too much a game of skill. That said, a great game. Just not quite as light and friendly as I'd imagined, with memory and general knowledge coming into play a bit too often.

No matter whether you know that dude or not...  You'll make you partner guess his name !!!!
The idea is simple : guess who's on the card.  But the 3 steps in the game make it fast, then brainy, then funny (and noisy).
Most people will like this game.

Ok, this is just a party game, but it's one of my evergreens. I love playing this game, it makes for really memorable nights and I'm 100% invested while we play. I love it. We do write our own cards though, so it's always very different depending on the people playing.

RATING: 9
I don't own this game.  The family has played this for years using paper and pencil.  We just call it the Name Game.

You hand out handfuls of paper strips and pencils to all your guests and they write down names of any person or character.  We collect them all in a hat... Guys against the girls.  It is really fun to see the different names that come up depending on the group your playing with.  

Great ice breaker and a great game to play with young and old...Guarantee you'll learn something new or from our past!

The girls always complain that our sports characters isn't fair.

RATING: 7
A very good game, but a bit intimidating for some people... until they understand that they don't need to know the "famous" persons, just to remember the clues given earlier.  A bit more thoughtful than the average party game!

RATING: 9
Kind of a mix of taboo and charades, but a very unique experience.  Can easily be played with paper and pencils so you and your friends can create your own game every time.

A great party game. I emphasise the word PARTY. Nothing deep here, although the memory aspect makes it a bit meatier than other party games.

Played numerous times (mainly with 6 players). Definitely my favourite party game, which is not a genre I usually enjoy much. I like the way the various phases follow each other, and how a given character can be turned into someone totally different in course of the game. The main drawback is that you have to play with players having enough culture in common - I did not do well when I played with an US edition (but it was definitely fun to try).

RATING: 3
For some reason this game just doesn't do it for me.  I don't like that it makes you want to split into pairs.  That means a lot of down time if you're playing with a large group.  Plus players get frustrated if they don't know the people's name (even if you explain how to solve without referencing the actual person).  The homemade version "Bag of Nouns" is way better.

One of our favourite party game, this is much more fun than for example Alias or Party & Co. The interesting twist is that you use the same cards for three rounds with less and less options to get your partner to understand what you're trying to express.

Originally I gave this an 8. But since then I've burned out too much on it. It didn't help that we kept playing and playing and playing, with the same group of people, more or less.

Really doesn't do anything for me. I enjoy the first round with free for all pantomime and speaking -- but I have HORRIBLE short-term memory and found myself looking at cards in the 2nd and 3rd round thinking "I don't remember this guy even being in the game before!" ... It's a neat premise, but I have no idea why folks are so gung ho about this.

This game was better then I thought. I think it was the people I played with as I'm not normally very good nor do I enjoy these types of games. Pictionary/Acting type. 

I recommend giving it a chance.

RATING: 6
There is no doubt that this is a great party game.  However, I personally dread playing it for two reasons.  One, having absolutely no idea who the person is (especially one that I should know of) and the other is the charade part.  I'm grateful that my partners were quite supportive and encouraging, but I've got to say that this is just not my cup of tea.

RATING: 7
Time's Up! is probably one of the best gamer's party games out there.  You don't need to know a bunch of useless trivia, you don't need to vote on which answer's best...you just need a partner and some creativity.

RATING: 8
This is a wonderful game for large groups of people.  The idea to use the same personalities over three rounds and just change the communication method has been received very well by every group that I have played this game with.

Would recommend this wholeheartily.

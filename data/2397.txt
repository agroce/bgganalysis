Great game.  Perfect for travelling, especially in North Africa/Turkey where it can attract a lot of attention/interaction with locals.
Stay away from the doubling dice unless you are with friends or very good or very rich.

Revised my previous rating of 8.
What was I thinking?! 
Speaking of which, when I first got into BGG I checked the games I played the most, like Backgammon, Othello and Texas 42. (I left hardcore gaming for many years for 'life reasons'.) Anyway, I was sooo surprised to see the low ratings on Backgammon. Well I have a large collection of hobby games now and with that depth, I can no longer stand the dice luck in this game. I get all the, 'its not the dice argument' but there is no doubt on a given game it can be all about the rolls. I play one off games but right now, I feel a rating of 5 is generous :P
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Backgammon is a good fast aggressive game with a reasonable amount of chance. To get the max out of it make sure you use the doubling cube which I didn't do at first - this makes the game much more a war of nerves (like poker)

A very good game which is a nice example of dice not being synonymous of luck. Surely, from one game to another, there is some involved but out of a 10 VP game, the best player will win. It's a classic game which should be part of any collection. I do enjoy a game from time to time.

Haven't played this since getting into Eurogames, but I used to play it constantly, particularly a version my friends and I called "Romulan Backgammon" (we were waiting outside a theatre to see "The Wrath of Khan" playing backgammon when a man walked by and taught us a "better" version) where you start with all your counters off the board and roll to get them on, rather than starting with them in the usual set locations.

I remember thinking this game was mostly luck, with a little strategy thrown in.  I thought this until I taught my cousin's husband to play.  In his very first game, he beat me.  In his second game, he beat me again, only worse.  By the third game, I was soundly pummeled, blocked at every turn from advancing my pieces.  It was humbling and thrilling.  I taught him the rules and he taught me the depth of play.

Bag Games Baggammon, the brown and white one, not the one with the green points. It's got nice, heavy blots which help weigh down the fabric board. It was only $9 on amazon.

GNU Backgammon has an excellent tutor mode but a slightly clunky interface. 

I like this assuming you play matches and use the doubling cube. The dice generate what moves you can make and then you decide what to do. It's got some opening gambit issues but not as bad as some games. 

While Backgammon is probably the best implementation of roll and move ever, I find that it can sometimes be frustrating, which keeps me from rating it higher. Face to face play can be kind of slow, too.

I think I like the idea of this more than the actual game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Based on a video playthrough of the Royal Game of Ur, I'd say that it's fair to say that Backgammon is pretty well the oldest game in the world. It has evolved a bit to be sure, but it's still recognizably the same game. It didn't accomplish that longevity by being bad.

The main fault with the game is that it's like you're two crowds of people running opposite directions through a tunnel, sort of bumping and jostling against one another. Like, yes, we're interacting with one another but how that happens is a bit random or, at most, like one of your guys knocked mine over. The obstacles and set backs feel more like the operating physics of the game than a careful, strategic back and forth between the players. You don't really care about what your opponent will do on his turn. You're simply playing the game the best you can on your turn and fortifying for whatever the opponent's dice roll allows.

I have no idea how many times I played this with my dad when I was younger.  It's a really interesting game about playing the probabilities, and while we weren't great about using the doubling die (as in, we used it sometimes and had no idea what we were doing) it is a solidly skill-intensive game in the long run.

I consider this a precursor to Kingsburg, or Marco Polo. It is all about rolling dice, and then using it optimally. And just like those other games, rolling high is almost always better, but that doesn't change good decisions that happen on the average.

I remember Backgammon being popular back in the 1970's and 1980's.  My wife an I played with a 1930's set and I had to find a set with 1.5" pieces on ebay.  It is a good way to close off the day with a little wagering on a best out of three set.

Propably the most popular game here in Greece. You can find it in every cafeteria. Its an abstact game using dice in order to move the pieces around. Thus its a combination of luck and skill. Backgammon is actually the first in a series of 3 different games using the same pieces and board.

I've only played this once just to see what it was about, and I don't really plan on playing it more.

There are some interesting choices here: deciding which pieces to move, whether to play safe or take risks, to try to attack or play defense.

But it's ultimately a lot of die rolling and a lot of luck.  It might work out well as a gambling game, but I really have no interest in gambling.  So it's from that perspective that it gets this rating.

The game requires some skill to play well but who wins is almost completely up to luck. A bad die roll and your opponent can send your pieces all the way back to start.

My gaming guilty pleasure. A light and fun abstract game for two players. I almost exclusively play on ios these days.

Not as tiring and tedious as most of other abstract strategies because of the included  luck factor which make it feel less heavy and analitical then it's siblings but still isn't very exciting.

Chess, Backgammon and Checkers just kinda don't belong here.  I've played each a lot more than 10 times but am entering 10 plays for these.

Interesting game to learn.  The effect of the dice is a little too heavy for me.  With any given die roll, there are usually only two or three good options at most, so it seems more of a reaction game than a decision game.  It is however quick enough (15 to 20 minutes) to have some fun and be done or play again if desired.

RATING: 4
Played this a lot in college, and then again during my honeymoon.  Don't know why I played so much, as my winning percentage was somewhere between 10-20%.  I t seemed I could never get the pips to work with/for me.  Even when it was race at the end, and I had a head start, the dice gods just shook their heads and zapped me time and again.  I can't remember the last time I played, and now with my collection growing rapidly, don't see myself playing again anytime soon.

Had always been curious how this game was played, since it is routinely found on the back of chess/checker boards.  I recently learned the rules and tried playing with my girlfriend.  Most games were fairly dull and non-interactive since we'd both almost always make "safe" plays.

Not sure if playing more aggressively would make the game more fun, but I can't imagine I'd want to play this too terribly often.  The upside is that it plays quickly.

I'm probably committing heresy of a sort by saying that [i]Backgammon[/i] isn't a very complicated game.  It is just challenging enough to provide a satifying experience, without having the potential to be a brain-burner like [i][thing=171]Chess[/thing][/i].

My son likes to play this game, and even requests it.  That's a huge bonus in my book, as I prefer to play games like Backgammon to the children's titles that are also listed in my collection.

RATING: 9
On average, the better player will win, which suggests it is far more than a simple race game of luck and averages.

Played it sporadically until I was introduced to the doubling dice. Then a whole new game of skill, gamble and mind-play opened up. Don't get to play it often these days, but I would gladly make more time for it.

Much easier to have an enjoyable game of backgammon between people of different abilities than chess, and for a complete novice it much less intimidating than go. I have seen some bizarre house-rules for this one, but never even entertained the thought of trying out any of these. No need...

Recently rediscovered how much I enjoy it after a 15 year hiatus. It will come as no surprise to people who know me well, that I enjoy it best when I am in a tight corner.

An old game that I didn't play until my wife's family introduced me.  Now we have a mini tournament every time we go on vacation together.  It's fast and fun, and therefore the luckiness doesn't bother me at all.  I also like that you can balance whether you want to play a complete luck-fest by being nice to each other, or you can play a harsh battle where moves are very cautious and strategic.

Some people may have written off this classic as too lucky because of the dice aspect, but I would challenge them to play against seasoned veterans.  There is a great deal of skill in this game, and it's a ton of fun to play.  I've been told that the game improves even more when using the doubling cube which I've not tried yet.  I think it could make this game near a 10 if it is an improvement.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The game itself is far more luck than skill, and while skill may factor in with novices more, I imagine with expert players luck is the big swing factor.  The doubling cube does all a lot of intrigue and brings this up from a pretty basic game to a game with a bit of strategy, a bit of psychology, and a lot of luck.  Thankfully, those are the ingredients for a pretty decent game.

My wife and kids love this game.  I nearly hate it.  I'm not sure why, as it's fairly well put together.

A pox on overly simplistic games that take to long for what they are!

Juego del estilo del parchis, que consiste en llevar las fichas propias hasta un destino, siguiendo un recorrido concreto. Cada jugador empieza con 15 fichas presentadas en una disposición adicional. Se juega con dos dados. Las fichas seguirán su recorrido avanzando la suma del valor de los dados, o dos fichas asignando a cada una un dado.. Cuando todas las fichas llegan a su cuadrante de salida, comienza la recuperación de fichas del tablero. El primero que recupere todas sus fichas, gana la partida. También se pueden comer fichas del jugador contrario, que deberá devolver al tablero antes de seguir jugando. Abstracto clásico, bastante entretenido.

Nice, simple game with some strategy and some gambling elements (do I blot that stone and risk leaving one of my pieces alone on one of my points in the inner table !?!?!?!?!).  Overall, an enjoyable game.  Going to keep track of my progress since I have got back into playing the game.  So my current record is.....I lost track :)

Update: Having given up competitve chess due to the preperation time involved, I've decided to try the BG route.  So far, so good, but I still have a lot to learn.  After playing a lot this last month, I appreciate the subtle aspects of the game more.

Further update: After playing this game a lot the last two months plus, I've decided that there is just way too much luck involved.  The number of doubles in a game appears to weigh heavily in determining who wins and loses so even if you master the basic concepts of primes, how to use rolls, etc... these can ALL be undone by a few high doubles.  In sum, I'll still play the game from time to time, but not as much as I had been.  Even though I've won quite a bit, it is just too frustrating to watch careful play destroyed by a few lucky rolls. :angry:

Most recent update:
Okay, so now that I've accepted the backgammon is not like chess where every mistake you make is solely attributed to your play, I am enjoying the game again....for the most part. :)  I've played some recently and won and lost some (more win than lose so I must be doing something right).  Good game so long as you don't expect too much out of it, so to speak.

The only way to play this is from a fun perspective.  The luck factor in this game is ENORMOUS!  I think the this game was invented to find a new way to gamble.

I have a friend that obsesses on this game (perhaps obsess is too strong a word). I end up playing it because he likes it so much. We used to play beergammon in college so there is some sentimental value there. It simply feels like there are perhaps 2 or 3 times in a game where you have choices. All of the rest of your rolls have obvious moves.

Backgammon becomes truly brilliant when you add the doubling cube. You must play with the doubling cube. It takes skill and nerves of steel to win--the luck will always balance out in favor of the better player in the end. Play with the doubling cube!

I do understand there is strategy and that it should be considered a good game, especially since it's so old, but with so many awesome and DEEP games out there like Agricola, Puerto Rico, Terra Mystica etc, I just can't justify to rate it higher according to BGG's ranking system as I really do not have a desire to play it. Yes, the better player will probably win, but there is still quite a bit of luck involved, and overall backgammon just doesn't offer a lot of interesting decisions.

The only way I will play this is using the doubling cube.  Otherwise it seems like a slow-paced game without many meaningful decisions.  But the doubling cube makes it much more interesting and quick -- no more rolling and rolling in a game that's already lost and a lot more risk.

I'd rather play a non-abstract game. However, this is one of the few games my father would play and thus holds a place on the shelf. To be completely honest, I don't think I've ever played Backgammon proper. He taught me a variant he called Acey-Deucy and from what I can tell true Backgammon is very different. I remember he would be extremely amazed every time I rolled double-sixes -- It happened a lot and he rarely rolled them even though we used the same dice.

This is also the game where I was taught how to roll dice in very superstitious ways -- blowing on them for luck.. when and when not to use the dice cup.. and the first game I discovered a pair of lucky dice which would roll doubles (not always 6's, either.. they just seemed to sync up) for me constantly but never seemed to work for anyone else.

Decent enough classic abstract...roll the bones and try to get your guys off the board as efficiently as possible. Though the dice can hose you on occasion, Backgammon is a game of look-ahead, you want to increase the likelihood that the dice are going to be able to help you, no matter what you roll. At certain points in any given game it can pay to be aggressive and go for it, but play the odds and you will probably come out ahead in this one.

Not a bad game, but not something that I particularly enjoy playing either.

A tactical game with gambling, strategy, calculation, risk taking maneuvers, and a fair deal of luck.  It really has it all.  You have to be strong in all of these different areas to do well in this game.  Normally with abstract games there's just one concept to master.  This one has several and being foolish in any of them can lead to disaster, but acting brilliantly in any aspect can lead to somewhat miraculous victories.

Like most people I dabbled in Backgammon before discovering 'real' boardgames, then dismissed it because it had dice & stuff in it. But over time I realised that Backgammon uses dice in the way one is supposed to: namely by asking the players to be creative with the result. And there is a [i]surprising[/i] amount of skill in that creativity, to the point where 'obvious' situations give rise to such incredibly counter-intuitive tactics and strategies that any doubt as to the game's depth should be dismissed there and then. 

The above comes with a 'but', though. The game is randomwise still fairly volatile, necessitating multiple plays in a row for at least some level of skill to show through. Playing single games is not such a great idea. Usually one plays to 5 or 7 VP. The doubling cube removes the dreary bearing-off because the naive strategy is [i]almost[/i], within 1/6th ply, the optimal strategy, a difference which will never be noticed save at the highest levels. Essentially randomness dominates this part of the game. The Crawford rule states that the doubling cube may not be used the first time a player ends up with a score 1 VP away from the end total. This prevents reckless play. None of these changes are difficult to implement, and they strengthen the whole considerably. 

With this updated point of view on the game, I've been on the lookout for a nice luxury Backgammon board ever since. To date I cannot afford the ones I'm partial to (Dal Negro Green Cialux, for example), but once I can... Joyjoyjoy. In anticipation of those games the rate has been given a more than deserved boost. 

Backgammon is also interesting because it was a game in which exceedingly strong computer AIs showed top human players that their game could be much improved. Of course the AI couldn't explain the why and how, but the fact that it could simply [i]do[/i] was sufficient for human minds to pay a little more attention to the game, to their lasting benefit. The same happened a few decades later when AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol, a very strong 9p player... although the computer power needed to have AlphaGo play that well is not within easy reach for most people. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I had to up my score to a ten when I came to the realization that Backgammon is my overall favorite game.  A well-played game of Chess is, to me, the single most pleasurable experience in gaming, but a game of Backgammon is [i]always[/i] enjoyable, win loose or (nonexistent) draw.  

Unless you're playing for money; then shit's serious.

UPDATE: I feel as though I should be upping the score, as my enjoyment of the game has increased as my understanding of it has deepened.  But alas, 10 is as high as this thing will let me go.

I'm fully on board with the "you need the doubling cube" crowd now.  I'll still happily play without it, but it adds SO much to the game, and eliminates a lot of the luck.

Played for awhile in a backgammon club locally and enjoyed the light hearted and jovial atmosphere there.
The laid back experience of this dice chucking and gambling game always brings back good memories of those days.This was before I met my wife mind you , not that I`m complaining or anything. But being single and just hanging out with people was different in a good way.This
is as far as I would push my gaming addiction on Norwegians. The consensus about boardgames is rather narrow-minded. Oh so you like kid games like ludo
and monopoly do you -is the general opinion. Its sad
that they`re missing out on great times gaming.

The more I play Backgammon, the more I like it. But I'm still not sure about it being a real 'strategy' game.

Edit: I now have hundreds of games (mostly on my iTouch, "Backgammon NJ") under the belt and have upped my rating to an 8. A very great game I'd like to play more often face-to-face.
And, yes, it's a strategy game.

Components: My copy is one of those briefcase sets, which is just great: felt lining the board, which has rims to prevent the dice from escaping; an actual ridge for the bar; and hefty pieces that players can slide around easily. Dice cups seal the deal.

Experience: I like this classical game. I am far from a strategist at it, but I like adapting to the chance of the dice, and deciding when to risk leaving my men alone. I have never played with the doubling cube, which I understand can add an element of betting to the game.

I own 7 boards.  My full size briefcase game is at work in the Games Room.  1 is Beachgammon, a roll-up water-proof foam board.  4 are in fold-up cases.  One is a tiny magnetic travel game.  One is a small magnetic game with Checkers on the back.  None of them are fancy.  The nicest one is Mom's which she gave me in Oct 2016, but it has mismatched dice.

Backgammon is one of my favourite games.  I don't have anyone to play with though.  I had played online on Fibs 20 years ago, and got my rating up to 1641.  I haven't played much since.

I invented a variant for 2 or more players, each player with their own board, playing white dice against an opponent on one side, and playing dark dice against an opponent on the other side.  One roll of the dice is applied to all boards.  So nobody can blame unlucky dice for their bad results.  I rate this variant 10/10.

Disclaimer: I have only played against two opponents.

Against my father, it was an initially enjoyable activity that eventually felt pointless, given the lack of ceremony that goes with winning a game. If we were more competitive, tracked our scores and played with the doubling cube, I'm sure I'd have felt far more involved.

My 2nd opponent - an englishman in Malaysia - was a far better player, introduced me to some concepts I had thus far been unaware of and beat me thrise (at least) soundly.

Far more enjoyable, as I gained new insights and my opponent taught me higher-level stuff.

Like many games, how enjoyable it is can depend largely upon the opponents. The luck factor can help a new player feel they have a fighting chance - and there truly always is the chance of victory in a single game - but as the players progress, disposition and difference in skill become more important.

It seems terrible to rate a game more lowly, perhaps based on the opponents, but then I remember that a good handicapping system can make other games far more enjoyable, regardless of difference in skill.

Disposition is always important, of course.

2009-08-30 4.8->8

Playing best to 7 with the doubling cube was an eye-opener. It shortens games where you don't have a chance and allows you to manage your luck a lot more - it becomes a game of evaluating chances and considering potential rather than just making the best move each turn.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Love this game in plain backgammon rules and more strategic tawla rules of play. Although luck plays a large role due to dice strategy is definitely a big part more so in tawla version (all pieces start in one column and you can sit on other player pieces effectively trapping them). Luck of die can make you want to flip the board some times or but can also totally save your arse. Also love the dynamic of sometimes having to calm yourself down and not just go all out for blood when you have a chance to kill peaces and be strategic (normally after getting your arse kicked).

This is also the only game I play on computer using gnubg version.

A study in probability. Yes, there is luck involved--that's what the game is about!  Planning for the most likely dice rolls, taking calculated risks, exploiting opportunities when the dice fall your way. Playing with the doubling cube changes the game and adds a challenge if playing a set of games. One of the problems I have with playing abstracts is that I think why would I play this if I can play backgammon or chess instead?

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Abstract, strategic, and short play time. 
 
Backgammon has the best mix of luck with skill in an abstract game ever. In a way it is more like a card game than a typical board game because you "play what is dealt to you" by chance and can "set youself up" for good positions by thinking ahead. Unfortunately, the subtleties are lost on many beginners who are quick to cry about dice without learning the fundamentals of the game. 

To all of you morons who complain "too much luck" I have this to say: don't be so impatient. The learning curve is not as long as Go or Chess, but it takes a dozen games to realize that you make your own luck via your choices. Yes, dice will kill you occasionally, but that is why you play a match of several gams, usually to 7 or 9 points.

A classic game. Not flashy and not new, but it has a lot of value for something anyone can get for a small price. 

Some of the first games of recorded history (Ur/Senet) are the ancestors of Backgammon.  A race game that is the basis for many games.

A must game in any game collection in my opinion.  It has so much history in it to learn about the history of games, and how games were created.  It is also just a fun, quick, easy to learn game.

The doubling cube used with a fun wager, brings some elements that really make it a faster and more complex game.

Of the classic two-player abstracts, Backgammon doesn't have as clean a design as Weiqi or Chess. But it has a push-your-luck element, which is one of my favourite mechanisms. I also have a personal preference for Backgammon. I'd like to see myself having a game of Backgammon in some cafe in Egypt while enjoying my mint tea and sheesha pipe!

RATING: 8
My husband and I kept a running total of wins.  For plain backgammon our scores were 5148 to 4836.  And for variations such as Acey Deucey and "leap upon your body" (I think this may be Plakoto) our scores were 814 to 711.

One year in college I lived on the top floor of an old frat house.  An art student in a neighboring room used to play acey-deucey until all hours with the door open.  I guess the sound of the dice grew on me, and that together with this being one of the first games I had -- guess I have a soft spot for it.

An abstract where I could never quite see where luck ended and skill began. There is usually and obvious 'best move' with what you rolled but the chance your opponent gets just what they need to thwart you is too annoying for me.

Acquired a beautiful version of this game when at university, inspired by the likes of Omar Sharif and others who lent this game apparent sophistication. The use of the doubling dice adds some skill to the cumulative gameplay over several games but, like Poker, essentially a simple game of chance with betting at the heart of the gameplay attraction.

Based on hundreds of plays.
+ Simple rules, complex strategy.
+ Has very nice-looking game boards. (I have a carrying case made of leather, thanks to Katja.)
+ Fast-paced.
+ Doubling cube adds significantly to game complexity.
> A lot of luck. We play usually 12 times before determining the winner (takes approx. 2 hours).
- As an abstract racing game, it feels sometimes a bit dry.
- Repetitious bad luck on dice may cause frustrating moments.

My favourite of the traditional abstracts.   Go I can never find people to play, and chess requires too much memorisation.  Best played in long series (games to 5 or 7 points) to reduce the impact of luck.  For a dice-based game, remarkably luck-free.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It is important to note that the dice rolls are played separately, not combined as a total. So a 3 and a 4 will not allow a move to a free point 7 spaces away, if the 3rd and 4th points are blocked to you. This allows the strategy in the game. And rolling doubles gets you 4 moves.

I really like Backgammon.  There is a luck component but despite not playing much seriously, I've always understood it to be a hybrid gambling game of both luck and skill.  Luck is part of the fun, and it's sort of odd to me that so many people mark it down so much for it.  The strategy is deeper than many realize but not so formidable as to be frustrating.  There are some great boards with beautiful components, and even the abstract design of it has a nice aesthetic.

RATING: 7.25
Stacy's favorite game. And she crushes me at it, at least 75% of our games. I've never really liked backgammon a whole lot, but I've played it about as much as almost any game. I'm not very good at understanding what's a good risk vs. a reckless move, and I am not very good at capitalizing on my opponent's mistakes. If I liked the game better, I'd read a book or something, but I'm content to let Stacy continue kicking my tail at it.

I don't log my plays for this one (in part because it would be too depressing) mainly because I think of it as a "regular" game, so I don't track it. Overall, I'm not very good.

Excellently simple yet involved game.  Yes, there's a lot of luck, but also tactical decision making to control the game, and an enjoyable sense of risk when you chance a move you know not to be completely safe.  An exploration of the gambling side can change the way players deal with risk, and is interesting for this alone whatever the stakes.

This is a classic that everyone should know.  Played as a match, with the doubling cube, it is much more fun, as it introduces a gambling element to it - my rating would go up then. However, rarely does anyone I know play that way. As a result, there is more of a roll-and-move mechanic than I like when I generally play.

Played my first game of this in about 25 or 30 years.  Didn't quite get all the rules correct (for instance, if a "point" has five or more pieces in it, it is considered blocked to the opponent's pieces; forgot about that rule), but still had fun.

Fun to play once you've "learned the moves" --- which takes a while and is aided if you have a patient teacher --- _and_ if you can accept the ~60-70% luck factor between players of equal "skill" (knowledge of "the moves," really).

I've played BG a lot, including in Online tournies in 2001-2004. I thought I knew and played the game well, but learned quite a bit more in the competitive environment. _If_ your playing someone who doesn't b*** and moan about the inevitable runs of bad and good luck, it's great fun.

The classic dice game of risk and reward.  I am not generally a fan of abstracts, but I can make an exception here.

I have a cool leather case set I found at a flea market, I think made in the 70s.  It was in perfect shape.  My wife and I have played it several times and it's great for tossing some dice and cursing your fortune when you just need that '2' to stop your opponent from winning and you don't get it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This game strikes a nice balance for me between luck  and skill. I always like games where you have to take calculated risks and this is really the archetypal one. Short playing time to (at least per set). The doubling cube is an interesting addition that introduces a bit of bluff in it and makes me want to play to 7 points systematically now (I didn't use to play with the doubling cube). I can play with anybody, including my grandmother, and it won't take more than a half hour. Great game.

Backgammon is one of those classic games (along with Chess and Checkers) that you can probably find in every home, classroom, and dollar store.  Although there is a lot of luck in the dice, a good risk management strategy makes Backgammon an interesting game.  The fact that it's one of the oldest known games as well gives it importance as well.  For the amount of luck / risk management, there is something special about backgammon that raises it above other games that present themselves as being this simple.  Plus, it's one of my go-to's with my wife!

Although I played thousands of games won't add them here as I don't want to mix the clasical games (chess, go, rummy, ...) with new generation ones.
I enjoy this game especially as I believe that when you have played a lot you start to consider it less based on luck and more based on the psichology and startegy.

RATING: 6
Of all the ancient and medieval board games I've played, this is my favourite, and also the one I've played the most often. So many ancient games follow this similar pattern of rolling the dice to move multiple pieces off the board whilst jumping on your opponents to send them back, but of them all Backgammon seems to be both the most streamlined and the most engaging. However in terms of what I want to play nowadays it's easily eclipsed by modern board games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Backgammon has an appealing combination of skill and random factors.  The skill comes in the form of assessing probabilities, knowing when to be aggressive and when to play it safe, and developing a sense of timing.  The stronger player usually wins, but the the weaker player can pick up a win here and there (unlike games such as Chess and Go).  Backgammon avoids the "brain burn" factor that causes many to shy away from other traditional two-player abstracts.

I love this game! Why do I love this game so much? I think it is because, while the dice can be fickle, you can always calculate the odds. Play them and win more than you lose.

I like the doubling cube, and it does prematurely end one sided games. This is a good thing, but it does eliminate the possibility of those strange, impressive comebacks which can be fun.

Timeless classic. The great 2 player game. Very simple to learn, but it takes a lot of practice to play at a good level. Excellent balance of skill and luck.

The pace is quick and there is a perfect balance of luck and skill equaled (though in a different manner) only by poker. The better player will always win in the long run, but a lucky streak can give the lesser player an occasional taste of victory. The game play is so fast paced and fun that even getting slaughtered is an enjoyable experience (for me, anyway!). It's also, of course, one of the best gambling games. A must have in any gaming library.

Propably the most frequently played boardgame in Greece. So much in fact that people don't even consider it a boardgame. It is a natural extension of your right hand (your left hand extension is a cup of coffee:)) In Greece there are 3 variations played secuantaly until a player wins 7 or 11 sets. Ideal to chat and brag over the results!

A classic along the lines of poker. Both are games of skill hidden behind a veneer of luck. Is it any wonder this one is also played for money? The game is best played as a series of games (e.g. win 5 games to win series) with the doubling cube to fully appreciate it.

Ye Olde Classicke. Enough strategy to keep the skilled player ahead, but enough luck to ensure some buttock-clenching nervous moments. It's very easy to pick up, and new strategies start prodding at your mind after just a few games. And that's without the doubling cube, even! Just the dryness of the game prevents me wanting to come back for more very often.

I don't know what it is, this is a classic game, loved by many, and yet I really don't like it.  I should, it has chance, strategy, and everything I normally like, I just really don't enjoy it.

I guess backgammon doesn't rate very highly amongst modern gamers, but it's a fun game that involves more skill than most Western people realise. In israel I played Backgammon more than any other game before or since. It's not just a game, it's part of the culture in Israel. I am not a great player, but I do okay.

I have had a bunch of backgammon sets, but my current boatd is the most beautiful ever. It's a gorgeous set of inlaid wood from Israel. I don't have good stones for it yet.

I played backgammon against computer opponents many times as a kid.  I think the first time I played this against a human was in 2008!  It's a dice game, which automatically puts it in a lower rank in my opinion, because I don't like games where you are completely at the mercy of dice rolls.

Erm - what? This was probably a great game back in 3000 BC, but it doesn't scratch much of my itch nowadays. While there are some good and bad moves and, essentially, some risk taking (or not) decisions, at the end of the day the person who rolls plenty of doubles wins. I must add that dice rolling games hold little appeal to me in general; if you like them, then Backgammon is probably much better for you than for me.

THE classic probability-based game, one that I've never been as good at as I would like. Simple rules and you can play in 10 minutes. There's fun here for the casual player, yet still plenty to interest the expert. Like all dice games there's the possibility of winning on a 'lucky roll', but good players make their own luck. It's less recognized as an intellectual pursuit than chess, so if you want to improve you really need to play a computer. I won't play for money on principle, so I don't usually need the doubling cube, but it can add interest to a series of games played to a point total. Among the best 2 player games around.

I played this a few times as a kid, however didn't own it until a few years ago.  I remember it being pretty easy and had a good idea how to play, however after reading the directions I was a bit confused.  After playing it, it was pretty easy, so many the directions just needs a bit of help.  It can be a quick learn if someone explains it to you that knows how to play.  It doesn't take too long to play either.  I will have to play it agian to get a better feel, however my feeling that it's an ok game to play every once in a while.  I'd recommend playing some other games over this one.  It does have some nice features, like the dice holders.

RATING: 5
I have a leather set without a doubling cube (which is fine for me since I don't gamble) and dice cups (again, I could care less).  Backgammon is OK every once and a while, but winning seems too dependant on rolling lots of doubles and playing conservatively.  While you can avoid leaving blots, the former is a touch harder to do without some rigging.  The game is only good in a certain, sporadic mood for me, I guess.

Update:  I think my backgammon set is asexually reproducing in my closet.  Where did all these copies come from?!

Backgammon is one of the few per-modern era games that I still like. It doesn't hold up against most modern games for me, but I'd still play it if asked. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I find this to be mostly luck, you do get to make some interesting choices however on whether or not to hit the opponent or run for it etc but you are always just trying to set yourself up position-wise while also having the odds in your favour as much as possible for rolling. A travel edition would still see an occasional play. 

Apparently doubling cube adds some kind of strategy according to some, I don't see it really, sure it adds some gambling aspect which I see as fun (or if you are a math-wiz you might be able to calculate your ODDS of winning at a good point in the game and make a "good gamble", but its still a gamble that relies on rolling) but not strategic in the whole sense of the word, you are playing odds which rely on luck of dice. Maybe I need to re-visit it but I just don't see my opinion changing.

Entertaining game that I can't imagine playing too seriously. I've heard that there are people who've spent a lot of time getting good at this game and I suspect that if I'd mostly played against those people this game would be down around 4 with Chess. But as it is it fills the same role for me as cribbage, it's fun to play while chatting, you don't have to devote all of your attention to it but it's not completely mindless either.

Sheshbesh! Great game, fast as hell, and tricky. Like checkers, some folks are so good at this game you'd never think it possible. You will play and lose to them EVERY TIME.

This is a game that everyone should know how to play. I'm pretty sure there are kids growing up right now that know how to work a first-person shooter they've never seen before but wouldn't know where to start with Backgammon, and that's a sad thing. Get a decent set, and feel the weight of the blots as you slide them around. This game even SOUNDS good. 

Oh yeah, real men don't use those stupid cups.

There's a lot more to backgammon than meets the eye. It's a game very much about tactical risk/reward instincts. Always playing "safe" will see you lose against the skilled risk taker, who will ultimately shut you out. Play enough to learn the doubling cube and a whole new world opens. This was my game-of-choice to reintroduce my wife to gaming, since she thought games were just for kids. Now she enjoys a range of euros.

My favorite game.  Most players greatly overestimate the luck factor.   A world class player will win nearly 1 point per game from a novice.  The main reason the game booms and then dies out about every 40 years is that when Backgammon is popular, the hustlers come out of the woodwork and fleece the players who think it is a game of chance, which quickly destroys the popularity.

Chouette changes this game from a great 2 player game to a great n-player social game.

Even though this game is ALL die-rolling you have some control if you make proper moves. I've won a lot of money playing backgammon because you have to know when to fold and when to double. It's a 10 because I'd play anybody, anytime for some cash.

I like this game.  Enough randomness to keep me interested and enough strategy to keep me thinking.

Taught my kids backgammon the other day.  They understood the game and strategy, but my younger one thought that capturing was "cheating," and he had a poor experience with the game from that point on . . . even though he was smiling like a Cheshire cat when HE captured ME!

Overall, I think backgammon is a great game for teaching kids about history (tabula in ancient Rome) and for introducing kids and adults to gaming.  There's nothing old, wrong, or boring with this abstract strategy classic!

I enjoy this roll-and-move game. I like games in which die-rolling (random number generation) is a core mechanic. Deciding where to leave pieces vulnerable presents a great manage-your-luck environment. Of course good and bad luck can rule a given game, but there is always opportunity for a huge swing of fate. Some people claim that the strategies can be deep, but I'm not convinced. Either it comes easy to me or I'm a lot worse than I realize. Not a bad pastime for when your opponent doesn't want to learn one of those "complicated" games. In fact, the huge advantage to backgammon is the very shallow learning curve. The doubling cube makes it a great gambling game.

 There are versions of this game all over the world. If you ever go travelling or backpacking, you will see people playing backgammon somewhere. Pubs, cafes, youth hostels all over the world have backgammon boards
You can find an opponent, discover that they play a local variant, play their variant and yours. 

There are few boardgames which have the same cultural crossover and ubiquity. 

It's one of the few boardgames I played time and again growing up because it's one of the few I was exposed to. It acts as a sleeper cell in your brain to be activated years later and think "boardgames - I wonder what else is available"

Backgammon is one of those games that I feel weird about never learning to play, kind of like how I never learned how to drive a stick shift.  It feels weird rating such a seminal game, especially when I don't know the game very well at all.  I can see how the game can continue to be so popular.  It's one of the most enjoyable roll and move games I've played.

RATING: 4
An extremely luck-heavy game which provides players with the illusion of control by limiting movement rules. I would liken it to Snake and Ladders. Ultimately its a race, so the higher your rolls the better. However, sometimes the high numbers don't work out and you find yourself in an even worse position.

I never tire of this very old, two player game.  My cousin Mike taught it to me and I will never forget how he beat the pants off of me those first games we played together.  I always remember him anytime I play this.  Is it any wonder that this is one of the oldest games in recorded history?  It never gets old.

I started playing BG about 5 years ago professionally (read for money), but these days I don't get around to the regular games anymore, though I still play in the occasional money tournament. Alot of people relegate this game to the 50% luck / 50% skill area, but I know from experience it is 100% skill unless the two players are exactly equal in skill.

Game itself can be a bit pedestrian and vulnerable to lucky streaks, but I'm a big fan of the doubling cube for cutting uneven games short, and it's good to retread the steps of a genuinely ancient game sometimes.

RATING: 6
A classic. I think it is more luck-driven than others seem to. There is most certainly a tactical element, but I fell that it consists mostly of "do the obvious thing with the dice roll, and don't do the obviously stupid thing." I really don't know why I like the game, but hey, I do.

Solid family fare.  Some games are favorites because they are masterpieces.  Others are favorites because they are familiar.  Backgammon is a nice game, that many folks are happy to play.  I'll never get super excited about playing Backgammon, but I'll never turn down a game.

Used to be one of my favored games growing up. But haven't played it for ages now. Kind of sad but can't say I miss it too much.

I prefer games like Aton now. Similarly abstract and random with diverse ways of winning. However, do to finite card deck luck tends to even out more evenly.  

Still together with chess one of the oldest games around... has to count for something :).

This is the true mother of all modern games. One and only perfect combination of tactics, strategy and a little bit of luck. 

People often believe that game with dices is only about luck. Here everything is a proper management of your "luck" - the better you are the more "luck" you seem to have.

I own 3 different sets: large wooden, small wooden, medium leather/magnetic.

Edition box with 200 games.
This game deserves a better copy.
I keep thinking of can't stop when playing this but the game is vastly different. 
Edit have a better copy now. Most recorded plays are two 7 points matches against GNU. Count as 1 sessionbackgammon
The tension is equal. Backgammon has a lot more strategy going on I feel. 
Addictive, quick, one of the true classics. Unbelieveable I had to see a game on television to give this gem a chance.
I believe this to be a medium weight game. Can't stop is light IMO. (the rule of 28 is common sense). There is also a betting variant on can't stop but it remains considerable ligher than backgammon
all in all both games satisfy my need for tension.


Rating from 8 to 7. With my games collection expanding i don't feel the need to suggest this anymore. I like it very much though.

I know other people rate this game and use of the doubling cube I do admit adds an edge. However it is really a game of throwing doubles. If you throw lots of doubles you will win, if you don't you lose. Once you have finished crunching the stats on 2D6 (which does not take long) you just play the odds. Its an okay game for a while, and is one of the few traditional 2 player games I will play, but will never be my first choice of play.

Unfortunately, a lot of people don&#039;t &quot;get&quot; Backgammon.  They say it&#039;s simple or it has too much luck.  BG is a very deep, very difficult game.  If you really want to know what BG is about, learn about Equity, Loss of Market, and other BG concepts.  The problem with BG is not that it&#039;s too easy or lucky, the problem is that it&#039;s too difficult!!  To really play well you have to work at it A LOT.

I always thought this game was just luck, until I played someone who was really good and got my *ss handed to me.  While there is no denying there is a lot of luck, there is a fair bit of skill managing that luck and certainly important decisions to make during a game.  Needs to be played as a series of a few games to mitigate the luck and let strategy shine through.  Love the doubling dice.

Lots of luck. I won my 3rd game against a expert player. The game is not very strategic. The best part is that the games last about 10 minutes and that at the end everything is sorted out so that there is no clean up after the game. A so-so game.

I don't think I've ever played this quite the right way, and I can never remember how to set it up.  But it's a nice enough way to kill some time.  Dice means randomness, but the pressure's still on the player to make the best possible move with each roll, so if you can calculate probabilities (like my hubby) you'll do better than those who can't (like me).

Old classic game. When I first learned it, I thought there was too much randomness; how wrong I was. [Note: Paul Magriel's book is a great read if you want to improve your understanding of the game.]

Still, I find the initial setup position lends itself to some very boring running games (e.g. maybe 25% of the time there's minimal hitting and just running), so I find Nackgammon to be a far better version (same rules, just different starting position which creates tons more interaction).

The doubling cube also adds some good complexity and trickiness. Great mechanism!

A classic abstract game.   Having a lot of fun right now playing this.  Like many classic abstracts, it strikes a superb balance between casual and easy play with some compelling (but streamlined) choices.  The whole board exists as a sort of a probability field, and the game presents you with the opportunity to both work from those probabilities or throw caution to the wind and go for a daring move that might hand you the win.  Great tensions at work.

Contrary to what most people say, I think this one is a real tactical game: chance is not important on the long run. There is not much in the line of planning or thinking ahead, and yet, it is fair: play with skill and determination and you can beat the pure chance. One of my all time preferred.

So far, I have played over 1000 different games in my lifetime, but finally at the grand old age of 32 a girl taught me the game of Backgammon...

I am sure I will play 100's of more games over the next 10 years.

Was on the back of Checkers set I received when I was about 8 years old. I ignored it for 4-5 years. Then I tried it a couple of times. Didn't care for it at all. I don't really recall why. But I have no intention of playing it again to find out. I think there were two reasons it was snuck into the Checkers box.  They had space on the back of the board and wouldn't require any additional pieces. Plus the publishers knew it was a dog.

Backgammon is primarily a game of luck but it takes a good chunk of strategy to win game after game.  I'm at this stage and I can vouch that, yes, luck is a factor, but it's not the only one, far from it.

For a quick game fix, backgammon is one good canditate as it's not long to play.

I upped the rating for this game as I see myself playing it at least once a day against a powerful A.I. in GNU Backgammon.

A classic abstract strategy game wit dice.

Lots of player interaction and hight rolls are not always beneficial, so the game is not very random.

Playing with the Doubling Cube is recommended, because it speeds up the game (when one player has a big advantage) or adds a poker-like bidding mechanisms.

For those bored there are lots of variants, of which I most enjoy a Greek variant called Tavli, which is even more confrontational.

Too much luck for me. (Yeah, yeah, I know.) Prefer the Greek variant "Plakato".

I'm setting this at 4.5 - though I dislike it, I can admit that it has some strategy and thus provides something that coincides with my reasons for playing games. And thus I will play occasionally, but with a very low tolerance. I do not want to play to five, and if forced to I will tank if necessary! 

So, if I'm evaluating a new game and I find myself thinking "I'd rather play Backgammon", that's a 4 or lower.

A pleasant activity for summer evenings on the balcony. Getting a nice boxed set (two-color felt, matching dice, matching cups) makes it more attractive. Don't think I will ever learn the deeper theory of this, and limit my plays to face-to-face with my wife. Of course, there is a lot of luck.

Although it's an "old person" game, I do love my leatherette carrying case; reminds me of how I felt when I played "office" as a kid. I also like the tactile-ness of physically moving bakelite-esque discs on a felt surface. SS and I didn't play with that funny numbered die, but she did teach me basic rules like putting someone on the bar and rolling exact numbers to place your pieces home. It's not a game I could get GB to play - we're more Royal Game of Ur status coz it's easier - which is why I rate this so low. Another game that requires a specific kind of person to play with or risk hurt feelings/bad blood.

Backgammon would actually be a terrific strategy game if it weren't for the dice, which can totally work against you. I wonder if anyone's tried it with a 36 card "dice deck," where you can only choose each card once before reshuffling it. Of course then it would probably be too fiddly. Too bad.

A game with an ingenious balance between tactical skills and luck. It's not about getting a favorable die roll in a given position, it's about putting yourself in positions where most die rolls will be favorable. Backgammon is best played over several games with the rule of the doubling cube applied.

It must be hugely popular down there and the general standard is subsequently higher.  I also  spent the Summer of `86 backbacking around Greece, sitting in Taverna after Taverna, playing what they call Tavli.  Happy times!

A classic game of playing the odds. I&#039;ve played against some of the best in the world (amoung them the world champion of 1994), not that I&#039;ve won more than I should against any of them. This game becomes fun when money is on the line, but can be tedious against players who don&#039;t know what they are doing. Like Chess you have to play players at the same level. (4 players can be done with a player playing &quot;in the box&quot; against the others who have a team captain. The other players just have to make cubing-choices)

I'm not sure it is possible to "rank" Backgammon using the BGG metrics.  It's sort of like rating Mancala, Hearts, or even Chess.  If a game has been around for 100s or 1000s of years that pretty much says all you need to say.  I'm giving it a 6 PURELY based on my current state and directly applying the rating metric.  However, as a tween / teen Backgammon is got a huge amount of play.  I played it with folks with whom I did not share a common language.  I played it with friends.  As an adult I played it with my kids.  Great game...that I might not ever play again in my life! :D

RATING: 6
I always can&#039;t remember how to set up the pieces after losing the setup in the rules. But I played this a lot when I was a kid, when I had a 3 in one checkers, chess and backgammon set. Roll the dice and manage your roll, not a great game, but an old one.

I like dice.  However backgammon is so much more than just the dice.  Yes, you can have a lucky roll, but more importantly you can put yourself in the right position to have a "lucky" roll.  Add the doubling cube and the overall effect luck has on the game is rather low.

Congratulations to Backgammon for being one of the oldest games on BGG! But, this game belongs in a museum, not people's current collections. Backgammon is more interesting than sheep tipping or whatever people did back in ancient Babylon for fun, but is dismally dull for modern times.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Game that has been around for longer than I care to know.  Each player starts with 10 pieces placed in different set areas on the board.  Players roll two dice to move their pieces, pieces left along by themselves are prone to capture from the opposition sending them to the beginning.  Doubles allows you to move 4 pieces instead of 2 and in the end you must roll the proper number to allow your pieces to exit.

One thing about this game that is never used, but exponentially raises the strategy in the game, is the gambling die.  If you think you are ahead you double the die and hand it to your opponent, they either forfeit, or try to come back for the value on the die.

I spent 2 child summers playing this game with a greek foreigner.  I was trying to score with the families' daughter that was letting him live with them.  

I really liked this game.

Entertaining classic with a certain amount of luck and some skill required (basically knowing what moves are too risky), especially when playing with stakes and the doubling die: if a player has got a couple of bad throws and feels hopeless there's always the chance to reject an offer to double the game and thus get away with a low-score loss. A backgammon play doesn't take too long, so that the game can become quite addictive.

Played this a lot as a kid with Dad. Fast pace, though moves for a given roll are somewhat predictable; there is often a 'correct' move for a situation, which means at some points the dice are really controlling the game and not the players.

Optimum mix of luck and skill for my taste, I guess.  Interesting without being overly demanding.  Fast-moving and infinitely replayable. (It's a shame that so many praise the doubling cube beyond what it's worth. Also a shame that many regard backgammon as a gambler's game.)

Love this game, just the right mix of randomness and skill.  That is, using skill to cope with bad rolls.  Even found Magril for $6 in a used book store! :)

Aaah, Backgammon. The game of my student years. My flatmate and I played this endlessly. Through some chance a friend of ours always lost, and firmly believed this was *always*due to bad luck. He just didn't get it. My wife got me a beautiful set when we were engaged.

100+ plays. Timeless. For family gaming (without the doubling cube) there's only occasional real decisions to be made inside a game, on when and how to leave yourself exposed, but it's a step up from other dice games and there's enough there to keep me pleasantly occupied. The playing field is weighted towards experience, but leaves the inexperienced a shot at a win, so you can say it's perfectly balanced for family. It has the huge advantage of being able to be played anywhere (picnics, etc). In this niche, it's received a tremendous amount of play and I'm always happy to entertain "just one more game".

A good 2 player game over coffee and dessert. This game grew on me over the years, after a period of me writing this game off.  I've learned that the best experiences aren't about finding the perfect strategies, but rather are about enjoying time spent with your opponents, learning, thinking, and playing. Backgammon can be an effective vehicle for that. Casual Game. Beer-N-Pretzels Game.

I think this board game falls into the "love it" or "hate it" category for most.  One of the oldest games in the world, backgammon is a "simple" board game between two people.  Easy to learn, this game is a dice rolling game.  Perfect way to pass the time with many 5-10 minute long games.

One of the games my father taught me when he got tired of playing checkers.  Like most abstract games, I've not studied this one enough to be great at it.

Does nothing for me. I'd rather play almost anything else. I am no doubt dulled to ancient abstracts by Euros, but I rank Chess a 10, and I like, Go, so... I think it was just annoying, and didn't seem worth the time to figure out the tactics that my only likely opponent had memorized. That's probably not entirely fair of me, I know, because I ask everyone within the sound of my voice "do you want to play a game?" and most of the time they are games that no new player would stand a chance winning, for the same reasons I don't want to play Backgammon. But I WILL spend the time, and am willing to get beat down repeatedly to learn other games. Just not this one.

RATING: 8
Honestly, a mediocre(6/10) roll-and-move racing game without the doubling cube; the doubling cube turns it into an epic mindgame of the ages: "I know that you know, that I think that you think..."

The game's as old as the hills and the doubling cube was only added in the early 1900s (AFAIK.) Surprised the game's survived that long without it - it totally changes the game, and makes it rightfully a classic.

Possibly my favorite game, I love thinking through the numbers and tactics.  There's a lot of harping on dice games and games of chance, but in backgammon every move should be based on solid statistical reasoning.  Anyways, any gambling game needs a little bit of chance involved, it keeps the game interesting until the very end.

Aside from a Nostalgia Run a few years ago with my father and a friend (back when I had enough free time to devote evenings to otherwise pointless gaming nostalgia, mind you) I'm just not sure I'll ever play this again. Back when there weren't many options for lighter abstracts, this was probably a lot of fun to get into. I'm sure there's a lot to memorize and learn about various positions and the statistical likelihood of certain moves paying off, but I simply happen to find other games more fun given the proper amount of playtime. 

Actually, I take that back -- I will play this again, as my son has a Chess/Checkers/Backgammon board now and I'll likely teach him when he gets a little older. But there are so, so, so very many lighter abstract, non-lifestyle games out there now that I don't see myself ever choosing to play this.

Backgammon is the sort of game I enjoy once in a while.  There isn't a lot of deep, long-range startegy; just make the best use of the current roll and hedge your bets for the next couple of rolls.  It's quick and simple but still challenging.  Makes for a good filler game.  I am currently teaching my almost 6-year old to play. [2009-FEB-24]

Most games played with mother-in-law.

The first game at their last visit started with doubles, so it was automatically double.  I was behind most of the game and had four left, two 6 away and one 5 and 3 away.  She had one left on her 1 spot.  I rolled double 6 for the win =)

Not nearly as random as I expected, and the list of clunky rules are mostly obscure corner cases.  So, it's actually a pretty clean game with some actual skill.  It can stall out and run a bit long for my taste, and there certainly is some swingy luck -- but it still has some interesting stuff going on.

This is one of the great games. It has been around for centuries and will still be around in 200 years. It is filled with luck but a skillfull player almost always beats the less skillfull player. It is one of the best dice race game. A lot better than commercial games such as sorry and aggravation and astrolaunch (which I played a lot when I was a kid).

A childhood favorite in my family, and now I'm enjoying it again, since the evening I first met Anna at an Esperanto event in Helsinki in 2005 and she proposed playing Backgammon during a late night conversation.

2015-02-16: I realized that we enjoy playing this quite often, already 220 logged plays. So I increased my rating from 7 to 8.

One of the few abstract games I've played all of my life. No game has a better balance of skill/luck but there isn't a lot of depth. Once the patterns are familiar, the limits of the game become apparent, and only gambling and the doubling cube have kept this game alive for so long. In general, I have no interest in gambling but it's fun to place small friendly bets in Backgammon - like playing for points to see who buys dinner.

I've never understood all the hype around backgammon. It's okay, but just not as interesting to me as other abstract games. If you want 1-on-1 games that use nothing but 100% strategy, chess is the obvious answer. There's also Go, as well as Chinese Checkers and Chinese chess. Heck, look in the abstract strategy game category on this site. If you want some less-known ones, check out the Gipf Project games: they're all brilliant.

[b]Unique Component[/b] - A Backgammon board is unique and easily recognizable.


[b]Unique Mechanic[/b] - The entire game is unique.  I believe this has more to do with the games age then anything else.  One of the first games ever created.  And still one of the best.


[b]Quick Thoughts[/b] - I absolutely love Backgammon.  Many believe this just to be a game of pure luck.  But those are people who don't know how to play.  It offers deep strategy in a chaotic environment.  Planning ahead and mitigating the roll of the dice is the strategy. 


One of my all time favorites.  Great game with depth, strategy and a little luck. Also, one of the oldest game known.  We usually play the best out of three games.

I got my copy of Backgammon in Christmas 2008. My mother bought me a very nicely designed suitcase that hides a board and game parts.
I played this very old game (yes, it's shame to admit that I learned to play it so late) a few times and I really enjoyed it. Big part of the game is rolling dice, but You have to make Your strategy, too. It's a really balanced game that can be played any time with anyone. Well, I think that is why all this classic games are so popular.

Games like Backgammon and Chess that are an everyday feature of life in certain cultures, and that have been so for many centuries, have an enormous appeal. Do the differences between chess and backgammon say anything about the cultures and personalities that prefer them? It's curious how backgammon usually comes in the form of a case, which implies mobility; there is a luxuriousness in the manufacture of backgammon sets rather than the sometimes ascetic quality found even with an expensive chess set (ignoring the novelty display sets of course) - and yet backgammon is the easier game to play where pebbles and sand are the only materials to hand. 

The most fundamental difference between the two games, of course, is that with the combination of luck and calculable probabilities, backgammon is a game about betting, if not the game about betting (where it trumps poker, as there is a playable game even without stakes on the table).

I find something more satisfying about teaching people how to play classic games than I do any modern euro; I think that this is a combination of the simplicity and elegance that is a fundamental concept behind any game that has survived as a classic (I include chess in this definition, but obviously backgammon is simpler and easier to teach), with the cultural weight and value that such games have. Unfortunately, so far your euro game only has a cultural weight and significance to nerds and geeks: hence this (fine fine!) website, and the relatively low ranking of the classics thereon.

This classic game is very well respected in the gaming world, even earning a place in the top 1000 on BGG. However, my few plays have left me somewhat cold. I will concede that there is a lot of tactical play in the beginning - blocking, hitting, avoid forming blots, etc. - but the end game always turns into a luck-driven dice-fest - who can roll the right numbers to "bear off" their checkers the fastest. Some have told me it's all about long-term planning. I am still skeptical. Until someone can show me how this has immense richness in complexity - and not tell me it's because I need to add a betting element to make it more interesting - I will remain feeling rather indifferent to it. Okay but I would rather play chess.

With a known backgammon player, I'm likely to suggest playing this game. With regular gamers, probably never. Backgammon has a fanatical following just like chess, who memorize openings and endings in the same way, not flustered by a bad die roll but going with it like a fork in the road. The goal of backgammon is to unload all your pieces off the board. The board is basically a U shape track, where each player starts at the other player's end. You can't begin unloading pieces until you have all your pieces in the ending quadrant. Each player takes turns rolling two dice, and moving two pieces (or the same piece twice) a number of spaces around the track equal to each die. If your piece lands on a single enemy piece, you capture it and put it on the bar. Pieces stacked two or more are safe from capture. Captured pieces must be rescued from the bar by loading them into empty spaces in their starting quadrant. Roll doubles and you can take two turns in a row, using each die twice. Not a bad abstract game, I enjoyed the backgammon stint I went through.

I could always play backgammon.  I have played more games of this than any other game in my life.  And for that reason I don't ever suggest it as the game to play, but I would always be up for backgammon.  I don't ever get sick off it.  I love the mix of strategy and luck.  I love that your attitude in a given situation plays a part.  Do I take a chance?  Do I need to be careful?  Shall I be bold?  Am I on a roll?  Have the dice been on my side?  Do I feel lucky?  I love that the tactics of the game allow me to see some theme there.  I have men built up along the front lines, I have defenders and a home base, I try to capture the enemy while I get my men home safely and I have men deep behind enemy lines that might get waylayed or they might break out and make a few attacks on their way back.  Backgammon is cool.

One of my first exposures to abstract strategy gaming. I've been playing backgammon since my early adolescence though it is harder to get it to the table these days with so many great novel strategy games to select from. I fondly recall playing this frequently in grade school. If we beat our Geography teacher she provided a single pass that could be added to subsequent wins and used to opt out of an upcoming test or discard a low quiz score. Great motivation to hone your strategy while instilling a love for abstract games.

People devote their lives to this one, but people devote their lives to many strange things. It is a good filler game, ruled by luck, with a very limited and determined set of correct moves. Still, it is quick and fun.

A lot of it is just the luck of the dice, but there's a fair amount of strategy involved too. 
Not a bad game, fits well into the "easy to learn, and actually takes a bit of strategy" category.

There is definitely a learning curve to this, but I think most of the skill will come down to basically be making known-good moves based on your roll and the board state.

In a way, this may be my ideal game design: Luck plays a strong factor and the choices can be so clear that it can be played very, very casually--but if you do care to go deeper, you can become skilled enough to nuance your play enough to start winning much more often than you lose. The doubling cube adds a simple but powerful layer of psychology I can't imagine backgammon without, truly giving an edge to those who learn to read the board state and their opponents' tendencies in the tense game of chicken that ensues.

Backgammon is an okay game for casuall play. The decisions are about optimizing you dice results while protecting your pieces from having to start over. The result of the game is probibly an even split between the dice rolls and your choices. The short legnth and simplicity keeps it from a lower ranking

RATING: 4
This rating is for playing the game the way most people I know plays it; just playing for the win of a single game.

I know the real rules include each play being worth points, and doubling the point value when declining to forfeit and whatnot, and then keeping score over multiple games, but I've never played that way. I really do think the game might become quite interesting when playing like that, but I've never had a chance to try, because I've never been able to convince anyone to play more than one game with me :P

Nowadays, I have so many good 2-player games that Backgammon is quite unlikely to ever hit the table, but who knows, maybe one day?

Wow, I'm impressed to read that this game possibly goes all the way back to the Sumerians.  Now that's what I call replayability!  I've never gotten into it, though to be fair, I've never had a full explanation of the rules so I don't have a complete understanding of the game.  I've always played on the computer, which allowed me to make certain moves but not others without me knowing why.  The board game version we own is a magnetic travel edition which I don't think has gotten any use yet.  Perhaps I will rate this game higher if I some day find the time to learn all the nuances of the game.  Game design: 3/5  Personal enjoyment: 1.5/5  Total: 4.5/10

My favourite abstract game. I would have given it a 10 if it had a theme I liked. An ideal combination of luck and skill. Anyone can win one game but skill will show in a longer match unless the players are evenly matched. Loads of strategy but still quick playing. It&#039;s also worth learning Greek Tavli which combines 3 different games on the same board.

It's been around for 5,000 years and is still going strong. I've played hundreds of games and I'm still below average and it doesn't matter, it's that playable. Now that I have played it with people who have only really played modern board games that I have found dissatisfaction, which I think defines the modern era of games - people demand a balanced experience, even if you're not very good or experienced at a game, I very often see complaints based on one solitary, unsuccessful play of even the best-rated games. This game is *not* for those people. It demands you make the best of your luck. Backgammon is not one of the oldest games in history for nothing!

Great game.  We have 11", 16", and 18" attache games.  We play often ... one of my wife's favorites.  Playing for money, using the doubling die is the best way to play, but even without, it's a good game.  No wonder it's been around for ages.  I prefer a padded board ... plain wood seems too harsh. When I win the lottery ... big-time Backgammon board ... and custom Cribbage boards.

I keep purchasing thrift-store and yard sale games, when they're inexpensive, so I can repurpose the checkers.  At a yard sale today I purchased a game with medium size pieces with a marbled look, and I threw away the board.

RATING: 4
There really isn't much game here. Usually there's a best move for any particular roll and the rest of the game is decided by un/lucky rolls and doubles. Sure there's some options in deciding to position your pieces to expand your options or limit your opponents, or to capture but the amount of control is so limited as to make that uninteresting in a single game. As a result you have to play multiple games (usually 7pts) to have a fair idea of the winner. It's this element of the design that I think appeals to gamblers and puts me off completely.

I finally got around to playing this game and I have to say, it's actually pretty decent. Just enough strategy in the game to make it playable but I suspect that most games will work out being similar to each other.

Backgammon is such a solid abstract game, I really don't think it gets enough appreciation.

Wonderful game. I've spent many hours playing and studying its strategies. A perfect example of a game that uses luck to add to its depth -- but without losing the excitement gained from dice.  Once you learn how to balance your strategy between running and blocking, the game really opens up.  Dynamic checker placement is a must, and match (or money) play with the doubling cube is key to long-term enjoyment.

But what I truly love about Backgammon, and this is where the game makes its enemies, is its brutality. As the saying goes, "Backgammon is the cruelest game," and it just might be true. For a game that presents itself as a simple roll-and-move affair, there is a nastiness lurking under the surface. When you hear people complain that Backgammon is "all luck," you'll know you've discovered that hidden layer.

The game is about luck, and it can humble even the most skilled players from time to time with a streak of bad rolls. But that luck is also its strength because, in the end, it comes down to your ability to tame the laws of probability. With proper planning, you manufacture your own luck. And when you are feeling the pain of the dice, you must keep in mind that, eventually, math will win out -- always.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Backgammon is a little too luck driven to play only one game at a time.  That's why the doubling cube exists.  The problem is that it is utterly impossible to find another player that wants to play a whole series of Backgammon games in one sitting.

I have a few editions of this classic game. Just the right blend of luck and strategy, not too heavy, but can be very competitive. Just the type of game I enjoy. It's only for 2 players though.

In my opinion the best game for playing on the balcony in the sun, or in an open air cafe in summer.

The father of all board games.  Backgammon is one of the oldest games in human history.  Countless other games have borrowed from it or attempted to imitate it.  It's replayability is infinite.  No two games are ever the same.  Tournaments are played all over the world and world rankings are kept.  Thousands of games are being played at any given moment online.  Nobody has mastered this game or ever will.  I've played upwards of 5,000 games and have achieved an advanced rating - still not expert or world class.  Whenever I have some spare time, I whip out my iPhone and play someone.  It is the Ultimate Board Game!  Never changing, never getting old.

A cheap magnetic travel edition that didn't even come with a rule sheet.
Instead the rules were printed on the cardboard box in which it was sold.
This has been sliced into pieces and inserted into the set.

Overall a poorly designed product: 
The board has been affixed to the outside, rather than the inside of the plastic case.
This leaves nowhere reasonable to toss the small, misshapen dice.

One of the great classics of abstract games. Not formally a combinational abstract strategy game due to the dice. However, in my book it still belongs up there with Chess (and its relatives) and Go among the greatest of abstracts. However, I like the two latter games more.

The doubling cube is a rather modern phenomenon (introduced in NY in the 1920s) but substantially improves the game IMHO.

I have fond memories of my father's copy of Backgammon growing up. My siblings and I enjoyed many sessions playing it. I only recently purchased a copy of it because it's not the kind of game I enjoy now. However, when my wife and I traveled to Istanbul, we saw it being played around almost every street corner. It brought back so many memories that I decided to buy a hand-made copy from a street vendor in Istanbul. So now I own it and it means more to me than just having the game. I can't imagine I'll ever get rid of this copy.

And the copy is beautiful. It's inlaid with brass and I hunted high and low in Istanbul to find dice with inlaid brass pips too. It's shamelessly more of a collector's possession than that of a game player's possession.

This game brought me back to boardgaming after a hiatus for several years in my late teens and early twenties.  I started playing this game for money in college and have probably racked up a few thousand plays.  I went on a 3 month trip with one friend and we played over 1000 games just in those 3 months alone.

Some people say the information in this game is too open - that all possible moves and their likelihood of success can be calculated.  I would agree, and would say that if you feel competent to do so, you are a good player and should play for money (or points) with the doubling cube.  Playing a series of games with the doubling cube is a meta-game that is the true challenge of this old classic.

Mom started me on Backgammon (and Cribbage) when I was 5 and we were vacationing at a beach house.  It has since become one of our "summer tournament" games. I don't find too many other people in my group that have heard of or know the game, though. I'm attached to it for nostalgic reasons, but it's still a good game in my opinion.

My favorite of the "classics".  Strategy with luck, short playing time, and some nice depth.  Highly accessible, minimal learning curve but depth for replayability.  20 plays in and consistently learning new tricks.  I'm practicing how to be aggressive.  I must master the blitz!!!!  Wow, feels like a euro.  Kosmos should retheme this and add it to be the crown of their two player line.  Nah, maybe not.  Why tamper.

Really started to love the game once I learned how to manage to backgame.  While its not a strategy one would actively pursue in the beginning, it lets me be super aggressive knowing that I still have ways to win.  Nothing is more satisfying than a successfully played 2-3 backgame ftw.  Ahhh bliss.

For a single match game without stakes, this game would probably fall to an 8.  For match play or with stakes, involvement of the doubling cube and relevance of gammons this is an easy 9.  Leave the doubling cube in the box while you are just learning how to play, however.  With some play, the doubling cube adds depth and ends games that you would rather not play out.  

I've played this way too much to enjoy playing somebody who is new (or them).  Playing online every couple of years is normally how I play, but online gaming isn't my thing.

Backgammon is "The Cruelest Game"

I guess this is the ancestor of the dice euros in which you roll dice and then figure out what to do with the results. Not my favorite way to have randomness in a game, as it seems crude and likely to create downtime. But Backgammon at least feels interactive.

I perceive some basic strategy, but the randomness you have to account for (when planning for the future) seems fairly huge.

The endgame, particularly where each player has all their pieces on the opposite side of the board so that no more captures are possible, lasts too long, has no interaction, and usually no surprises.

First learned Shesh-Besh (Six-Five) as a child, and have played most of my life.  The doubling Cube makes it a very different game, especially if bidding/gambling.

An excellent couple's game, when you want something with luck that is more intense and longer than Cribbage or Lost Cities.

While not considered "really" part of the Parcheesi family of games, Backgammon is the best of them by far.  What makes the game work, in my opinion, is the possibility to play a back game.  This completely changes the game's nature and can allow a player who is behind to be able to come back, instead of simply resigning.

Backgammon gets an unfair rep as a gambling game, best played for money.  Yes, the doubling cube is essential, but a match played to 16 or more points doesn't take that long and no money need be involved. (Use the Crawford rule if a player hits 15.)

Backgammon has a lot of interesting strategic choices, but there's a very high luck factor to it.  It has the kind of luck factor where a well-laid plan can be completely disrupted by an unfortunate die roll or two - and that makes the game feel very luck-based.

Aside from that, it is pretty simple to learn (it looks more complex than it is) and can be played pretty quickly - and it does have a lot of interesting choices.  This is a perfect example of a game to pick up and learn online at a site like Yahoo! Games, so if you're unsure about backgammon, log on there and learn it before investing in a set.

I don't normally like abstracts, but this game's great!  The dice give risk management and new tactical dilemmas each play.  The doubling cube is simply the best piece of game design I've ever encountered - it makes me wonder what other 2-player games would be like if they had it.

RATING: 9
My go-to classic game.  Prefer this over Chess or Go.  Yes, the dice can decide the game.  But more often than not, smart play, risk taking vs. risk management, and clever use of the doubling cube will rule the day.  These things make Backgammon a real winner for me.  Always willing to play.   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Backgammon is fun, particularly when you are willing to play for a few dollars. That ratchets up the strategy and the need to occasionally go for a game breaking move that is not an optimal play. The doubling cube is the single most important strategy element to master the game as using it correctly often makes the difference between winning and losing a match.

Backgammon may be the first game to be mentioned in written history, going back 5,000 years to the Sumerians of ancient Mesopotamia. During the 1920's, archaeologists unearthed five boards from a cemetery in the ancient town of Ur. At another location, pieces and dice were also found along with the board. Boards from ancient Egypt have also been recovered from the tomb of Tutanchamun, including a mechanical dice box, no doubt intended to stop cheaters.

I remember playing this when I was much younger (say, 9 or 10), and just loving the heck out of the game.  Now I've had the chance to play it again as an adult, and while I still like it (it's a "classic" that I wouldn't mind playing again), it's very, very different from how I remember it being.  Still, the use of dice as giving you choices is an interestingly "Euro" element that was unexpected.

For most of my life I was aware of the game of Backgammon, but ignorant of how to play it.  Sometime around 2000, give or take a couple of years, I finally decided to read the rules.  For a couple of months I played the game a lot with my girlfriend (now my dear wife).   I enjoy the game quite a bit and she did too.  I played online on Yahoo Games for a while, and nowadays play sporadically at work.

Durante la mayor parte de mi vida supe sobre el juego de Backgammon sin conocer sus reglas.  Alrededor del año 2000, más o menos un par de años, finalmente me decidí y leí las reglas.  Durante un par de meses jugué mucho con mi novia (quien es ahora mi esposa).  Me gusta mucho el juego y a ella también.  Jugué durante algún tiempo en línea en Yahoo Games, y hoy en día juego de vez en cuando en el trabajo.

I started playing backgammon in the early 1980's. I've enjoyed the game with periods of intense multiple plays followed by long stretches of not playing this game at all only to follow this cycle over and over again. The nice thing you can go back and pick this game up and quickly start where you left off. The board is a case so it is wonderful to take when traveling.

RATING: 5
Considering I don't like dice games much, this one is all right. I can definitely see where the strategy comes into play. However, the game I played came down to just mindlessly chucking dice at the end, and it seems to me that a lot of games between players of roughly equal skill will end that way. Some find that exciting; I find it annoying (in the sense that I feel like I should've just skipped the game and just had a 10-second roll-off).

With the doubling cube it becomes a vastly different game.  Objectively it's  a good abstract game (deep, challenging, varied), but subjectively it's kind of weak (luck can play a strong role, no real angst, too incremental).  I like sharper decision points.

I really enjoy Backgammon, however I don't have any close friends or family members who feel the same way, so I almost never get to play it.

Of course the gameplay is pretty simple, rules-wise.  But I like the decisions that need to be made with each die roll.  Should one race full-tilt, or should you be conservative and keep yourself protected whenever possible, or should you try to cover several points and block your opponent from being able to move past you?

Very simple, very short, very fun game.

Classic abstract games of rolling dice and moving discs around a board.

I played this wonderful game occasionally since I have been a teenager, but I really learned to appreciate it's depth in my mid-twenties. There I have been taught some really hard "lessons" in a local bar here from an egyptian friend. I don't know how often I had to pay his tab after losing to him. But after some time I got more experienced (also in controlling his cheating...) and it began to level out... Unfortunately he moved away shortly after that. I miss our games.

This is a tough game to pick up because all of the little quirks and jargon, but it is a lot of fun, I like the mix of luck and skill.

Update: The more I play this the more I love it. Chess is a beautiful and elegant game, but I wouldn't call it fun. Backgammon is very fun. The randomness of the dice can lead to some insanely one sided games, but it can also lead to some extremely crazy situations that causes both players to shout out in surprise. The doubling cube is also an excellent game mechanic that adds a lot to the game.

I'd sooner drink out of a mud puddle than play a game of Chess. If you're like me, Backgammon might be for you. Described in a strategy book as "the cruelest game" Backgammon is a classic all the way around, but expect it to break your heart many times before you get the hang of it. Some complain about the dice factor, but lucky rolls alone won't win you lots of games over the long run with an experienced player. Best played over a series of games to a match point; learning how to use the doubling cube to best effect is what seperates beginners from intermediate players in those situations.

Its fun to pass the time but really isn't very strategically interesting. Once you grasp the game it is mostly about luck. 

This is a great game to teach people new to strategy about thinking ahead, planning, and counting. 

A little more fun with betting on the doubling cube.

This is one of my old school games (as opposed to new school or Eurogames).  I will never turn down a game, but I don't play it like I used to.  It is a great bridge game that I can play with my friends that don't really like playing new school games.  I would say, "Buy this game."

I rated this game based one playing this game on 4 completely different versions of play sistems that friend from Egypt teached me to play. Some versions of game deserve higher rating. 6 is overall.

I'm not sure what the deal is with the doubling cube.  I've never used it, but I still enjoy the game.  Nice and light.

Simple, maybe too simple, for my taste (but still some room for tactics).

Good game - one of the original games from the East.  Involves less luck than most people think, as it is a dice game.  A good game for visual mathematicians.

A time-tested game, the best matches are between opponents with similar skill levels.

My very first boardgame. Fond memories of playing with my grandfather, which I regret not having the opportunity of playing eurogames with. I am sure he would have loved them  :(

After 2+ Plays: Seems like a good gambling game, which it used to be popular as.  Luck plays too big a role to be satisfying as a strategy game.

Mica made us green and orange backgammon pieces for our wedding, but we don't have a board for them yet.

Roll and move. At least it's fairly short so you can get a few games in.

Played this online for months, before I went on the sites forum and read that it was rigged for paying customers and free players alike Vs. Bots who rolled perfect results almost every time.

Played it on another site and found out that the harsh lessons had made me quite a pro!

Perfect blend of chance/strategy. This game is the best example which proove that you can make your own luck. And it's got history (back to Sumerians!)

While playing I somehow imagine that the ancient greeks must have played this one; therefore I feel so antiiique... In addition Fortuna is usually on my side.

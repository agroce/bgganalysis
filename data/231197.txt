RATING: 5
I enjoyed the theme and seeing characters that I recognized from Dead of Winter. It's a very puzzly co-op. I wish I got it from the hype for free instead of paying retail.

RATING: 5.5
Interesting little co-op. Very puzzley. Some random bits in when/how you flip cards. I like how the longer you stay in the round the more bad things happen to you, as  consequences of your actions.

As a solo game, this seems on the level of Friday: an enjoyable puzzle with some narrative elements. The puzzle of Friday is more interesting than Raxxon, but Raxxon has a better, and much more apparent, narrative element. 

Raxxon is a decent co-op experience. But we're only likely to play it as an end-of-the-night game or if we want a puzzly co-op that is lighter than Pandemic Iberia. The solo game will probably be played more. 

The core card flip mechanism is, honestly, kind of boring (the card game Golf has a more tense card flip), but the aspects that are built on top of it save the game. In particular, the pass vs. consequence decision is quite good, and I would like to see this mechanism used in a more complex game. The Raxxon cards are a welcome addition, but aren't as interesting as the Crossroads cards found in the Dead of Winter games. The Raxxon cards leave me wishing they put a bit more effort into the writing. The marketing around it is interesting and hard to separate from the game itself. The online scenarios are a definite plus, but I've only just started playing through the online scenarios. I may have to update my comments after finishing them up. 

As of now, is it worth $40? No. I'm having a hard time deciding whether this is a 7-range game or a 6-range game.

Edit: Sept, 2017: 6-range.

Played it with 1, 2, and 3 players. It scales well. 1 Player can play in about 20 minutes, 2 is about 45, and 3 is just over an hour.

I really wanted to like it, but it was a total swing and a miss. The story moments seldom triggered, and when they did it was just "move Raxxon's power up one". Maybe with 4p more story moments come into play. The puzzle itself wasn't good. Once you play half of the game though, you're looking for a needle in a haystack and the difference in a win and loss is nothing more than luck of the draw. It tries but just isn't very good.

It's a decent, but ultimately mediocre game that certainly did not deserve the hype and marketing gimmick it got. The basic mechanics are smooth and kind of clever: evacuating the healthy gets you closer to winning, but also saturates the population deck with more infected. Quarantine allows you to get infected out of the population deck to restore balance. 

Unfortunately, the game is just dry dry dry. The art and flavor text do help a little to make the theme come to life, but I kind of wish this had just been a small card game, since it would travel well and would feel more appropriate considering the weight of the gameplay.

RATING: 5.9
Raxxon is 90% marketing and 10% game. That's not meant to insult the design, as I think it's an enjoyable, light game. But the real fun and drama of this package are in the acquisition and the fluff around it.

Overall this is a fine design with some interesting mechanisms. It does manage to feel as though you are wrestling to control the crowd and searching through it for those who are healthy.

It does fail to really achieve a level of excellence due to its repetitive nature and lack of oomph. There's nothing huge and sexy here to swing your vote and win you over. I do still need to explore the online scenarios and see if that will make a difference.

--------------------------------------------------------

After trying all of the online scenarios - yep, fine game but nothing spectacular.

Finally got around to playing and I got to say I was very happy with the result. The theme is there, but I do think you have to get into it to appreciate the theme fully. Go on the website, see the mission reports of others, and the subtle story moments on cards are enough to give the game a very specific feel.

Pretty good. Initially feels abstract but manages to trigger laughs and a lot of emotional response despite this.

"This may be my last transmission for a while. My team and I are low on supplies and cannot move about openly, but at least we are safe. The sickness has spread more widely than we at first anticipated. Most of the people we once knew are now gone. And Raxxon ... let's just say it would be wise to be careful around them. And, under NO circumstances must you EVER [signal lost]"

I like to think of Raxxon as a boardgame version the Minesweeper computer game. You turn over a few cards on the first turn just to get some information, then you start thinking about smarter, specific moves to help avoid setting off a "bomb" by revealing too many infected cards. Fun puzzle-like game that feels thematic and can be played under an hour.

RATING: 7
Pretty decent, light co-op. Pretty tough, which is a plus. It plays in less than hour so you can get your butt kicked and either try again or move to something else. I'm  curious to 'learn' a better approach because we're not close. If the game isn't solvable, it may move to an 8.

A solid cooperative card game with some unique mechanics (manipulating the grid of citizens, push your luck action selection).  The fact it can be played solo, and easily, pushes it from a seven to an eight.  Highly recommend for solo play and those who enjoy a good cooperative with tense moments.

I have played 1 solo game and 3 two-player games now. The solo game was on introductory level with the 3 subsequent games being on regular difficulty. I originally found this game easy at the intro level. It's much more difficult and in my opinion better, at the regular difficulty level, which is what I expected would happen after my initial play through. Really interesting game. My friends all enjoyed it as well.

Not quite as good as Dead of Winter, but still an excellent co-op game that does its theme well. Can get stressful, but that really puts you in the experience of the game. Not huge on how the player boards are set up in comparison to how actions and consequences carry out, was a little confusing to grasp at first.

Novel, if unimpressive.
The mechanics that Raxxon puts forth are interesting and very well polished, and the game is dripping with wonderful thematic story snippets... but I can't help but feel that this is an excessively random filler card game pretending to be a big box boardgame.

For my money, The Grizzled is a very similar game but plays far more elegantly.

The mechanics are interesting but nothing we haven't seen before.  The only really interesting part of the game is the Raxxon cards, much like the crossroads cards from Dead of Winter.  Although you have an array of actions to pick from during your turn, 90% of the time there is really only one appropriate choice.  It's just a mediocre game that is actually very light.

Fun little cooperative that is much more manageable than its parent.  Would be susceptible to an alpha player syndrome (no "traitor" and scant hidden info) but it wasn't a problem when I played.  It helps that it is on the light side and that it is perhaps just as fun to lose as to win.

And I love the wry sense of humor.

Decent co-op.  The beginner game wasn't very interesting, but the main game has some decent choices and some nice tension.  There's a lot of luck, and an early screw-up can lead to a nearly unwinnable game that you will still play out, but it is relatively short.  I wish there were more differences and cool powers among the characters.

Played with 3 twice.

Dead of Winter based strategy card game with variable player powers to reposition and rescue the healthy and quarantine or eliminate the varied level infected from a 3x3 display. Push your luck aspect causing sudden night time or having to draw a Raxxon card (Crossroads) from action consequences or from revealing infected. I like how difficulty scales in successive rounds as healthy are evacuated.  Interesting reactions from trigger effects as cards are revealed. Solo rules seem to work well.

A pretty good co-op game that has some neat puzzle elements to it set in the Dead of Winter universe. The way they've decided to market this game initially is pretty different, not something I would want every game company to start doing though. Hopefully they'll open up the option for everyone to buy it after awhile so everyone can try it.

I really like this even though I've only played solo. Quite a bit of replayability, nice production, meaningful decisions a plenty! I found it easy to get immersed in the setting despite not playing DoW. Hope to actually play this co-op soon.

GAME: Maharaja: The Game of Palace Building in India
RANK: 495

RATING: 8
Initially thought this to be too chaotic for me to really like it but there are subtelties underneath the surface that make strategy/planning more important than I originally thought. Still relies heavily on a large amount of tactical awareness however.

RATING: 9
This game combines route-planning, tight economics, role selections, and hidden pre-programmed actions, with the overall result being a deep strategic gamer's game of controlled chaos.

The goal is to build all seven of your palaces OR to have built the most palaces by the end of the 10 rounds.  In order to build, you need money.  You "score" money each round when you have a presence where the maharaja is visiting (palaces, houses, your builder).  Money is awarded by majorities in cities (again, most "points" from palaces, houses, your builder).

In order to get to a city, you need a path, which will consist of houses that require a toll (money) to be paid, unless you have your own house along the path.  Houses cost money ($1) and palaces cost money (generally $12).  To assist you during the game, there are seven available character cards which provide unique special abilities that can be used in conjunction with your turn actions.  Each turn, you simultaneously select 2 actions and execute these in turn order.  The actions vary from building palaces, houses, acquiring more houses, selecting character cards, income, and manipulating the turn order track.  Of course you can't see what other players are doing until it's their turn.

Sound confusing?  Essentially, generate income (through having a presence where the maharaja visits, by selecting the income action, and through collecting tolls from your houses) in order to build palaces.  Build the most palaces and you win.  Use the character cards to facilitate your 2 actions each round.  There's several paths to victory, and games usually end with a tight finish.  My only gripe is with the convulted ruleset.  It should also be noted that there are several rule variants, most of which are easy to implement and improve the depth of the game.

Clever area control game which rewards medium-term planning. Lots of potential for double-guessing. Works well with two players, I'm looking forward to seeing how it works with more (answer: the more players the better).

 Raja  is, in my opinion, a very nice game. 
There is something in this game that remember me “Medieval merchant ”and  “El grande” that are 2 of my preferred games.
The game is really  deep because you must  balance your actions between the needs of build and change character and modify the sequence of cities visited by the maharaja to obstacle the opponents and favour yourself , not easy but very intriguing.
Really a very good game !

I liked this on first play, but I've got a sneaky feeling that I would either like this a lot less or a lot more with several more plays.  On the positive side, it's pretty elegant, classically Euro and has huge scope for variety of tactics in temrs of action choice.  On the negative side, I think analysis paralysis could bite hard and there are perhaps too many diverse choices which means it's possible that some games might be chaotically unpredictable.  I like area control games, but I have played better and worse ones.

I don't think this game gets enough good press.  Perhaps it is overshadowed by the Indian theme for some, but for anyone who plays games casually or even infrequently is bound to pick this up quickly and enjoy the entire process.  The Board is substantial and gorgeous and the wooden bits are colorful, but it is the elegant gameplay and decision making devices that make the game almost second to none.  Play this, you will not be disappointed.

RATING: 5
An okay game.  Area control + route building + more.  The action selection and fluid aspects (turn order, order of actions within a player's turn) are interesting.

Negatives:  No catch up mechanism whatsoever.  Once you're behind, forget it.  The game is self-reinforcing in a few respects -- the rich tend to get richer and the poor tend to stay poor.  Placement of villages is critical.  If you don't have a good network, you're toast.

I did not enjoy my first play (5-player game).  The strategies I didn't know (village placement, ignoring the first town if you're going 4th or 5th, being sure to get at least one center palace) came back to bite me in the rear.  I lost horribly.  From about 1/3 of the way in, I could see that I was behind and that I would *never* be able to catch up.  It's a big turn off for me if, from only 1/3 of the way in, I can already see that I've irredeemably lost.

I would try this one again.  Having played it once, I suspect I would fair much better.  Even so, I don't think I would enjoy it much more.

Interestint area control game. When you learn the rules and the penalty for making a wrong selection, you may consider that this will ever happen to you, but making mistakes is easier than you think, be careful! 
In my last games I got the impression that there is a leader runaway problem. I reduced my rating.

1st play: I went into this game with very low expectations. Not being a big cult of the old guy, I'd never heard of this one and expected a dated game. This game was excellent. The quick rounds, the area control elements and the ability to pull off combos make for a great game.

2nd play: I liked it this time as well.  It's not super deep, but the simultaneous action selection game, combined with the ability to control most aspects of the game make it enjoyable.  It plays even faster than it seems.  As much as I liked it, I'm not sure it stands out enough to remain a part of the regular rotation.

The goal of the game is easy, build the most palaces. But reaching that goal can be quite convoluted. Most of the game is about finding ways to collect the necessary money to build your palaces. Very enjoyable game of managing several sources of low level chaos and trying to not make all of them turn into a large chaotic mess.

Inicialmente me hice con el juego por sus críticas y el buen precio de la edición alemana. Componentes de calidad en un juego extraño, mezcla de elección de roles y control de mayorías. Digo extraño por la sensación que me ha dejado en lo poco que he jugado. Acaba la partida cuando le empizas a coger el gusto. Parece que no perdona los malos turnos, es un juego de desarrollar una estrategia a largo plazo. Caótico, cuesta"visualizar" las jugadas. Tras jugarlo de nuevo he visto que no es tan raro como me pareció en un principio. Si los jugadores saben jugar se dan situaciones interesantes. Sin embargo es para 5 jugadores sí o sí.

This might almost be the fourth in the Tikal/Java/Mexica trilogy.  Maharaja has the potential for fluid movement of Mexica.  While the number of actions is reduced, many more options of what to do with them are added.  Perhaps in response to criticisms of analysis paralysis in the earlier games, chaotic elements are also added.  The game becomes highly tactical, though not as random as some suggest.  Two plays in, I like this game a lot.  My one concern is that a player who gets off to a good start is tough to catch. My one criticism is of a messy rules set that has generated many questions.

Very interesting game with lots of tough choices and neat twists. It has a great strategic horizon. That said you have to watch out for someone getting a large lead--especially in money--as they can end the game rapidly and thwart more elegant plans. The biggest knock against the game is often the endgame is predictable a turn before conclusion. If players don't collude to stop a leader in the late game, it's over.

I don't understand all these high ratings. I (and at least one other playing companion) couldn't wait until this overly-complex game was over. Swapping characters mid-turn? Why is this a good thing? It destroys the flow of the game.  Secretly choosing not one, but *two* actions every turn? Why? If you guess wrong you're screwed! Moving already-placed houses? Why is this necessary? It reduces the need to add houses to your "pool." The wandering monk is taken often, reducing the impact of houses, anyway. In my game, hardly anyone paid anyone else the "house fee."  Additionally, you're pretty much forced to calculate every player's score at all of the palace locations and watch your pennies very closely; add this all up and you could suffer a massive brain-freeze. Sorry, but I have no desire to play this again.

i believe my first game of this was with 5 players.  at least 4.  anyway, it was nothing short of a trainwreck.  constant and fruitless rules consultation over ambiguities, inability to execute plans, the hilarious monk kingmaking situation, etc.  everyone but the owner walked away hating it, and in researching things it appears we played the game correctly.  it's something i would love in theory, too: chrome, wheel, player powers, majorities, etc.

Knizia can be hit or miss for me.  Some of his titles really hit the mark - others much less so.  Maharaja hits the mark pretty close.  I like the interplay between the roles and building options.  I like the planning required to effectively compete in the game.  The game play will favor more experienced players, but the hurdle is not insurmountable.  Play is extremely tight and refined and seems to show a solid level of development went into the final game.  This is meatier game and is well suited to gamers.

RATING: 5
As many gamers have stated, Maharaja is chaotic.  That doesn't mean it's devoid of strategy, but mixed within all the money management and action usage is a lot of the "guess what the opponent will do" sort of gameplay.  As my rating suggests, I'm a fan, but I always get this nagging sensation that a more structured turn system would've made the game better.  There is still a lot of long-term strategy, but altering turn order mid-round drives me insane!  Still, it's a brain drain, and I recommend it.  

Update: Most recent play was disappointing.  It's still a chaotic, involving game, but it seems unfair that you can fall behind by not anticipating what the board will look like after four players have taken their turns.  Maharaja WANTS to be a game full of flexible long-term planning, but the mechanics just don't bring this to fruition.

Egyelőre jobb híján ketten próbáltuk, annak ellenére, hogy tudtuk, az igazi bonyodalmak 4-5 fővel jelentkeznek. Így sem volt rossz, sőt! 
A grafikától nem ájultam el, de általánosságban igényes a játék. Nagyon egyszerű a menete, elvileg le lehetne pörgetni 10 perc alatt, de az akciók kiválasztása, a folyamatos dilemma, hogy mikor melyik karaktert használjam, a számolgatás, hogy ne fogyjak ki a pénzből, melyik úton tudok olcsóbban menni, hol lesz a következő kiértékelés, stb... elég komplexszé teszik a játékot. Vagyis elég sok apróságra kell figyelni, előfordult, hogy nem tudtuk végrehajtani az akciókat, olyankor fizethettük a büntit. 
Egyébként nekünk úgy is csak fél óra volt a hossza egy partinak, hogy nem pörgettük túlságosan, de 5 fővel szerintem simán lehet 2 óra is. Kipróbálnám úgy, hogy többen vagyunk!

A game of route planning, area control and player induced chaos.  Maharaja is a direct descendent of El Grande, Die Handler and Wildlife.  I love the blind action selection and ability swapping!  The downside to all of this is that Maharaja may appear far more random than it actually is for there is zero luck.  Once you play a few times, you realize that the action selection of players becomes easier to predict.      

Although I prefer the player interaction more in a 4-5 player game, a 2-3 player game offers more control and is almost as interesting (especially if you play with the more than one Character official variant found in the rulebook!)

Played the first time with so many rules wrong that it really was a game almost, but not quite, entirely unlike Maharaja. Played again since with a much better understanding of the rules and the game is just fantastic. That'll be the last time I try to learn three games in the same day and then teach one.

I really enjoy this game. It's a tight game of optimization with some calculated risk decisions dependent on others actions. Like El Grande, you lock in your action, then reveal it and carry it out. Will your picks be the right moves when it comes to your turn or will the other player unknowingly or quite intentionally foil your plans? 

This game may cause you to lose friends.

A very interesting game.  I do enjoy that multiple strategies can be viable.  You certainly need to be able to adapt because of the rapidly changing game layout.  Is a great brain burner.  If there is a drawback, it is that you can see the victor from a turn or two away, and be powerless to stop them.

RATING: 8
A real gem in my book. The possibilities of all the diferent interactions between the chosen actions and roles available is seemingly endless. Because of this the game can cause major AP in people prone to this condition. But it also makes for a game with plenty of roads to victory and great replay value. Money is so tight it hurts and every choice you make is a choice against other possibilities. Requires a good but flexible strategy to come out on top in the end.

An alright game. Not painful to play, but very chaotic.  My only concern is over the chaos created by the exchange character action and whether or not one can alleviate it at all. Otherwise, it seems like a solid euro (a bit dated?), but not really anything I would request if I didn't own it.

Only 2-player, this is more of an estimation of how I think the game will play with more players/with more games.

First play impression:

I don't know what to make of Maharaja yet. I find the opacity alluring, but I'm wondering if the supposed chaos will be detrimental to my judgement of the game . My first minutes of play with five players gave me the impression and taste of a game with uncontrollable randomness, but once the rules got out of the way it became manageable and what looked to be a game that experienced players will excel upon. 

I need to play again to consolidate my rating. For now a seven.

Well, one play so far and I like it - a lot. Similar to Taj Mahal but a lot better in my opinion. No auctions but role selection and area majority. The ability to shuffle the order the areas appear really shakes things up and the money seems to be tight which certainly helps keep the tension up. Nice pieces too.

*Update* couple more plays. I am finding it hard to get this to the table but, when I do, it gets a very good reception. It is as much of a race game as anything else, with some opportunities to take risks and to screw other people over. Very enjoyable.

Chaotic, but balanced.  Not spectacular, however, you could do far worse.  Actually, it has some brilliance in the ingenious mechanisms; however, they do not always mesh into a cogent game.
*With more games of Maharaja the gameplay turns staid and repititious.  This applies within a game and between games.  They all feel very redolent and unvarying.  It is also quite hard to catch a leader and the tiebreaker appears too frequently for my taste.

RATING: 9
I am one of the very few people I know who really likes this game.  The choices and interaction between players are fascinating, and the variety of options you have during the game make for a fun time.  There can be a lot of chaos with more people as things can really change unexpectedly, but I actually like that aspect.  It's a sword that cuts both ways, and the randomness can be a powerful tool against your opponents.  I suspect many in my group dislike this because the randomness can be hard to plan for, they get screwed over and never give it another chance.  

Given that I often win, I guess I'm not helping that any.

Great Kramer & Kiesling game. A lot of thinking involved. Many choices for only having 2 actions per turn. It's tense and chaotic but well balanced and it plays smooth. A pity that it needs 5 players to extract all the game's juice. For me it's hard to find much people who want to play this game.  

*Update*

After more than 2 years without playing this again, I'm afraid today I will not like as much as back in that days when I was a boardgame rookie. It seems that it will remain unplayed for another while (a pity).

*Update*

Traded away.

Wow, very interesting mechanics, beautiful components. A sort of a thoughtful racing game (getting the central palace is very important). Probably the only game that can be this heavy and chaotic and be (definitely) a worthwhile purchase.

Not fiddly at all, the various  moving parts to this system seem to capture the essence of some favorite mechanics: variable player roles/powers, tight economics, action choices that are too few in number for what you want to execute in a given turn.  I'll have to re-evaluate after more plays (and with more players than just two.)

Comprado en la bsk a RubioSA en julio 2010 por 12+7€
Consiste en ser el primero en construir siete palacios en diversas ciudades indias. Para ello hay que viajar y construir con el arquitecto, lo que cuesta un dinero que se obtiene gracias a las visitas del rajá. En cada turno, el rajá visita una ciudad y los jugadores recibirán dinero según el grado de presencia que tengan en la ciudad.
Además, los jugadores llevan un personaje que les otorgan ciertas ventajas.

Es un juego de bastante cálculo y planificación. Entretenido. De 3 a 5 jugadores. Por lo visto, se recomienda a cinco jugadores (solo lo he probado a cinco).

Vendido el 05/01/2015 a Alberto MErino, a través de la BSK, en un lote de 13 juegos por 200€, con gastos de envío incluidos. Hice dos envíos. Este fue en el primer envío.

Liked it even though one of my good gaming buddies has not been a fan of it and warned me it might be too chaotic for me.  (The same guy also played in my game and acknowledged he had been frustrated because he had been trying to plan several turns in advance.  He tried planning for the current and next turns only and had much more success and enjoyment out of the game).

I like this game.  With some players, it can be more chaotic than with others, as they change the vistitation order.  This can affect planning, of course, making it more of a challenge.  Also works in one favor sometimes, too.  I don't play this enough, nor do I play it well, but it's a good game.

One play. Not a bad game, but not enamored with the system, which rewards getting a head start in the beginning of the game with the palaces.

I want to like this game, but cannot.   The game reaches a point where all players MUST earn a crystal every single turn, or you will lose.  You MUST play a perfect game.  Once you fall behind by a single crystal, your game is likely over.  imo this ruins what is otherwise a great game.

Organized chaos they say. Usually a great game. Even if you're in last place, there's fun to be had mucking up everyone's strategies and I'm not sure this is the wrong thing anyways as I've seen players unexpectedly come from behind doing so. Adding one or two folks that don't pick up the spirit of the game can really bring the enjoyment level down though. Love playing this game, but make sure you have the right group of players.

RATING: 6
Not bad, but not our style. I really like the role-selection aspect of the game: since it's tied to the turn-order, choosing a role involve a little bluffing and a little luck to get what you want. Money and movement are very tight, which provides a lot of tough decisions from turn to turn as you try to maneuver your way across the board.

I tend not to like the "this phase we are scoring only THIS" types of scoring, and that is all this is. You can try to build multiple palaces in advance of a scoring, or just follow the Maharaja around trying to get the most lucrative 3-point palaces. Unfortunately. this doesn't work well as a two-player game, so we sold it away.

Amusing that it's rated so high.. yet it's completely boring and broken.  You can kingmake all you want, and I'm really shocked nobody sees this.

Somewhat conflicted. First game (3 players) didn't go well and was boring. Second game (4 players) went much better, but it still seemed to be missing something. The choices were tense and interesting, the game seemed the right length ... but it somehow didn't feel compelling. Not sure if it was a lack of player interaction (not a strength of this design team), a lack of any kind of strategic options, or just a lack of depth beneath all the mechanisms. Still, an intruiging game, and definitely one I'll play some more, but not sure of its staying power.

RATING: 8
[floatleft][ImageID=196479][/floatleft] [b][thing=9440]Maharaja[/thing][/b] - Maharaja is a tough game to assess.  Let me get this out of the way initially: I liked it.  A lot.  Probably.  The reason for that hedging is that I'm not entirely sure that Maharaja is a good game.  When I put it side-by-side with another highly interactive multi-player game in the same genre -- [person=2][/person]'s [thing=475][/thing] -- I can't think of much (if anything) that I could point to in Maharaja as evidencing an objectively better design decision.  Indeed, much like [thing=37734][/thing], Maharaja is something of a sprawling Frankenstein's monster of a game with some potentially unnecessary peripheral mechanics.  But, as with Cavum, [person=7][/person]'s everything-[i]and[/i]-the-kitchen-sink ethic just works for me.

For those entirely unfamiliar with Maharaja (I know I was until last Wednesday), the object of the game is to be the first player to build all six (seven?) palaces (the glass stones in the pictures above).  To accomplish this, players engage in simultaneous action selection, role selection, turn order jockeying, network building, resource management, point-to-point movement, and area influence.  Effectively, however, all of these mechanics build toward a single game currency: money.  Even the palaces are really just illiquid money, since building all of one's palaces will always take the same number of actions over the course of the game.  That money is obtained by investing influence in the region being scored this turn (one region per turn) using an ordinal payout scale.  So players basically run around the board every turn building houses and places, hoping to spend as little as possible in order to make as much as possible, so that they can do it all again next turn.

On my first play, the game felt a little loose in the joints, but I think that's because I didn't fully grasp all the implications of the system.  Even still, the four-player game ended in a three-way tie (with money as a tie-breaker, naturally).  Now that I've had some time to absorb and process the systems, I'd love the opportunity to play again and see if it tightens up once I'm truly playing purposefully.

[floatright][ImageID=253728][/floatright]The game does have a few novelties worth mentioning with more specificity.  The action selection is implemented through this weird spinner clock thing (two actions/turn = two hands).  It seems dorky and gamey and off-putting at first, but it functions exceptionally well.  

The second is the role selection.  As in a game like [thing=27833][/thing], roles w/special powers are tied to turn order and can be selected by players throughout the game.  The special powers are such that they really dictate a player's strategy.  Interestingly, players keep these roles throughout the game unless they (or other players) choose to spend an action to swap roles.  So turn order and, more importantly, player strategy [i]pacing[/i] is an entirely interactive cutthroat endeavor.  Anticipating who will be looking for which roles (and when) involves precisely the kind of opponent-reading that I love in games.

[floatleft][ImageID=199634][/floatleft]Lastly, the artwork looks ghastly in the photos on this site, but it quite attractive up close.  The actual board layout could have made better use of the space aesthetically, but the art is quite nice and really resonates with me.

This isn't an instant-love game by any means, but I'd be surprised to see it do anything but get better with repeated plays.

This is a clever game of knowing how to pick your battles, and trying to make battles you'll win come up more frequently. Which fits into the cycle of building palaces to get money which you then use to build palaces. Which you need to do in order to win.

It feels like a streamlined version of Die Macher. But somehow, for me, it loses a lot of the soul of Die Macher.

[u]October 2008:[/u] Just received this one, the components are gorgeous, don't know however how much I'm going to like it, I think I'll need at least 3 games to know.

[u]November 2008:[/u] After one 3p game, I really liked it and am eager to play some more and start creating some real strategies.
A second game: Liked the game BUT next time we'll play w/o the 7th person as we feel it messes up the game, I'll need at least another 2 games to see

[u]May 2009:[/u] Yep definitely play without the 7th character, it really breaks the game, without it though, the game is very solid. I finally managed to try new things and it appears that there are really very different strategies. My last game was entirely different from the first. This isn't the heavir and most challenging game there is but it does show some nice thinking ahead, some strategic planning. There are multiple paths to victory and they all seem viable though only more plays will confirm this for me.
I'd say it's as heavy as Puerto Rico, though I never played PR like those maniacs who have solved the thing! It's a good game involving tons of decisions without being a brain burner...
Bumped the rating to an 8 without the 7th character.

RATING: 5
While the action selection is pretty cool (especially the manipulation of how the maharaja moves), the game ultimately feels old - and not in a good was as several of my favorite games (Ra, Samurai etc.) are old too, but as in "wow, this game really is kind of boring and it's clear that the design is outdated". It also seems that it's quite important to get some income (a palace) as early as possible, and there is a tendency to rich gets richer, which again is a sign of an outdated design.
I've played it twice, and that's definitely enough for me... It's just not particularly exciting or rewarding.

Good game. Very good mix of network vision and action planning. A player can't win if lacking one of those two skills. A lot of thinking is required too. I like the variable character powers. I think they are very clever. But it looks as though the builder is too powerful during the first half of the game (while establishing the road network). I don't like the art and colors of the gameboard. Great quality components. Good theme. In two words : good euro!

There is a lot going on in this one.  Moving parts and things to think about.  The chaos with the governer track movement and role stealing makes this one hard to plan ahead, but thats OK, I kind of like that in this one.  I definately need a couple more plays to full grasp what is going on.

Maharaja is an excellent example of a game that presents the challenge of "I want to do X things, but I have only Y actions." There's so much you want to do, but you're limited to two actions per turn. 

In Maharaja, players are racing around from one location to the next, trying to build houses and palaces in time to score points when the Maharaja rolls into town and pays everyone out. Although money is the key currency in the game, the player that wins is the one that builds their 7th palace. All these locations are connected via a network of roads, and players need to build houses or pay money to move from one place to the next.

Maharaja also asks players to choose their two actions secretly and simultaneously. That's where some real fun can come into play with the brinksmanship between players. Going first lets you nab certain spots, but it means that players can follow behind you and wreck your plans.

Every time I play this I enjoy it. It's great with four or five players.

RATING: 9
An awesome race game where players use majorities to earn money to build more palaces. First to seven palaces wins. A moderate brain burner like Tikal but more happens each round. The simultaneous action selection adds chaos that really makes the game shine. There is no luck involved at all.

We play this 2-player with the basic rules.  We find the game nicely balanced, with the different actions and character powers to choice from.  Some of the colors are odd in the game - pieces that should be a set do not match and colors that represent different areas are difficult to tell apart.  The gameplay itself is a big mix.  You need to commit to two actions at the beginning of a round so you must do some second-guessing of your opponent, as well as route planning.  Choosing characters plays a smaller, but still very important role.  In this game, once you choose a character you keep that same character from turn to turn, until you spend one of your two turn actions to change it (or someone else uses one of theirs to take your current character.)  The game is quite interesting and has played out quite differently each time we've played.  Although the games are generally close, you usually know who has won a turn or two before the end of the game.

RATING: 7
First impression was quite good. More to explore on later plays, for sure. The chaos of simultaneous action selection and the potential effects on turn-order and tile ownership could have been a disaster, but I think it worked, and worked well. It does have that typical area majority feel to it where you're spreading yourself thin to eke out slim majorities (or chip in little bits for the dregs of a majority), but the house mechanism makes that work reasonably well. All around, a very engaging older style euro.

I liked this a lot more than the rest of the group did (again).  The components are beautiful.  The gameplay has a lot of fun elements. You must choose to sacrifice increasing certainty to obtain increasing power.  For some players, the uncertainty and subjection to other players' whims is too chaotic or feels too out-of-control.  For me, that gambling feel is a tasty part of the game....and brings into it a whole other dimension of bluffing and guessing opponents plans. Sadly, I fear my opportunities to play this will be few and far between.

After further playings...I am puzzled at the Wandering Monk role. Seems that it can be abused to create collusion between players that the rules don't account for.

RATING: 3
Doesn't do anything particularly wrong mechanically, but takes two of my most hated things: blind action selection and chaos (the chaos not actually coming from the blind choices in this case, for the most part, it's not a direct aspect of it at least) and combines them into a game that wants to be heavy but ultimately ends up drowning under the weight of all the out of control circumstances. 

Players tend to follow the Maharaja (your scoring friend) around the board to varying degrees of success setting up palaces along the route. The blind action picking mechanism worked well enough for me, but I disliked the amount of chaos that the character swap action could introduce into the game. To summarize, each player always has a role in front of them that confers special benefits and has a number between 1 and 7 on it, this dictates player order. The problem with this being that in carefully choosing your moves based on what other people before you are likely to do, you can end up screwed when the order is changed around on you. The blind mechanic seemed to be close to working on this but for that issue. One other issue: the end game on this is dull, the race to 7 palaces loses tension about halfway through the game when someone gets a one palace lead and then keeps it up. Perhaps more play would eliminate this and keep people in the hunt more, but I don't think so, I think it's a necessary condition of the 'rich get richer' payout scheme, and it seems like this one will always come down to a couple of players winning or sharing the win a few times in the early game, getting out to a lead, and then keeping it, as more money allows more actions, and so on. 

Another huge issue for me with this game is stagnation. Players who can establish a lead in a given area are likely going to keep it unless one is willing to expend ridiculous amounts of resources to kick them out. This makes the game feel very undynamic, and it drains further life out of the proceedings for me.

I don't know, the game seems to be doing a lot of things right, but it just isn't as compelling as I was hoping for...it just feels...close to being a good game, but not quite there, and hence, it ended up being even more disappointing.

My first experience with Maharaja was at Spiel 2004. It was a strange experience, with most of our party losing because we overlooked the fact the goal is building palaces, not gathering money. (Strange but true.) The next time around, I played according to the correct rules, losing badly again: I had tried to play anti-cyclically, but that strategy only works when the order of towns visited does not change. Which is therefore just as bad an idea as following the crowd. I do not really like this game because of the lack of being able to plan anything: I always feel like taking one step forward and more than one step back, unless, of course, you are fortunate enough to hold on to the '1' character which allows blissfully uninterrupted and moderately enjoyable play. The character and play order changes upset the gameflow too much, and winning because your gut feeling was better than that of your fellow players can hardly be called a crowning achievement. 

Beautiful components, but a disturbing lack of strategy and 'one more go'-appeal once players discover the actions of character stealing and visitation order changement. Avoid with 5, where it takes too long and really is a great mess; is somewhat cleaner with 4 although still out of control; avoid with 2 as there is nothing in it at that number. This game has overstayed its welcome in my collection, and was eventually sold off.

[b]Update[/b] Many, [i]many[/i] years later I was made to sit through a game with 3 players. Even here the low-grade chaos rears its ugly head. This is not a game pattern I enjoy. I was glad the game was over and done, and hope to avoid it forever in the future.

I like it.  It's got a bit of a learning curve, 'cuz you need to guess what you actions you'll be taking when a lot can happen 'tween selection and action.  However, I still like it.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
[Provisional rating, based on two games with two players] Reading through the rules, I was impressed with the number of interrelated systems at work. The rules seemed relatively simple to grasp, considering the diverse gameplay involved. The potential for chaos seemed high, due to the reordering of the Governor track, the character selection and ordering, and the hidden action selection, but it actually seemed like it might be really fun to play. In practice, however, we ran into some issues. 

There seemed to be a catch-the-leader problem when playing with two players. In our first game, my opponent got to start and she chose a low-numbered character that gave her first turn order. I, basically, chased her and the Maharaja around the board, for the rest of the game, rarely getting the high scoring palace. So, not only was she always one step ahead of me, but she also got twice as much money each turn because of that lead. Steamroller.

After the first game, I did some research here on The Geek and found that others ran into the same problem. There were some suggestions about how to reduce the problem, but many seemed to just be ways to fix a system that was broken in the first place, as opposed to something that I was missing in the rules or strategy that I hadn’t discovered. Yes, once you see that the other player will score the central palace in the first city, you can take an outer palace and attempt to jam some houses in there and leave your architect there in order to outscore the opponent, but it seems like that uses too many resources and this complicates your future planning. Yes, you can head to the second city and get the central palace there, but the first player can leapfrog you the same way and, besides, she still has more money than you because she won the first central palace. Yes, we could have used the "bid for characters" rule, but bidding in a 2-player game feels retarded. Yes, you can reorder the governor track, but in my first two games, I didn’t manage to pull a win using that tactic. In the second game, we used the Yogi (who provides an extra action) in hopes that it would balance out the situation, but it didn’t (he might actually be imbalanced, as well). I did try stealing and/or switching characters a couple times, but I never gained the edge that way either. 

Of course, the player can probably dig himself out using some combination of the strategies listed above, but I feel like he shouldn’t have to. The other player didn’t have to figure out some game-winning strategy to get ahead; all she had to do was go first! This may be a non-issue when playing with 3-5, but the box lists 2-5 players, dammit.

The other problem that I see is that the victory condition to win is simply to place all of your palaces. So, most often, one of your two actions is taken up by building a palace and if it isn’t, then you are one palace behind forever. Even worse, at some point, you realize this and have sit through the remainder of the game (wash, rinse, repeat), with that knowledge, like an idiot. 

I really want to like this game, because I still think it really has promise with more players, so I think that is my next step. I won't condemn the game based on two games, without the optimal number of players.

I have a hard time getting people to play this, but it's a lot of fun.  It's incredibly tense, and doesn't leave much room for error.  You know the ones; when you can trace losing the game back to 'that time in turn three when I paid two coins more than I should have', you're talking about a tight game.  I highly recommend playing with the Yogi additional role (not in your first game, though).  I'll probably end up rating this higher someday.

This game's getting better with each play. There's a lot in here. Its a perverted and vicious influence game, but only as a means to earn cash and there are other ways to grab cash off your opponents. Its really all about getting your palaces built! The large range of actions to choose from force you to think "what do I want to achieve" rather than exhaustively working the options. Thats a breath of fresh air in a euro. Finally, the role selections and changes add some nice twists to play order, action choices and opportunities to trip up your opponents. Mucho fun.

So much to consider (9 possible actions, the governor track, six characters with differing special abilities), yet so little of it matters, as any planning can so easily and unpredictably go awry.

Old school euro with secret action selection. Beautiful and really fun although it tends to math out at the end since there's no catch-up mechanism. If you don't mind victory by concession this is a lot of fun.

Good fun but there seemed to be something missing. There seems to be several strategies open to you, but the scoring is so strongly in favour of the central palaces that you seem to have no choice but the follow the maharaja and win a few of these. If you don't do this then you don't et enough money to be able to build enough palaces to have any chance fo winning.

RATING: 8
So many great things to do in this game.  Combine them to take a big lead in a city, start a good position in a new city, manipulate which cities get scored, build and cut roads... just all good every moment.  Doesn't get to be a 9 because with five people, there is just too much other stuff happening between turns.  Of course, if something is important to you then you can manipulate turn order, so it isn't a chaotic mess.  But it is still a little chaotic.

RATING: 8
Excellent game.  Can be a bit of a brainburner but is a lot of fun as well.  I don't buy the argument that there is too much chaos.  You can always mitigate the chaos by selecting "swap character" to get back any character that may have been swiped from you.  Of course, if you have a solid position that doesn't require a specific character, you can press on with 2 different actions.  I look forward to my next play.  This one needs to hit the table more often.

Players represent Rajas in India, who are competing to building structures in cities that will pay off when the Maharaja comes to visit.  The pay off is invested in further structures.  Structures include houses in villages (which earn a "toll" fare when other players move through), and houses/palaces in cities.  The player who constructs the most palaces wins the game.  The base rules are quite simple, however the interaction between the two secret actions chosen each turn by each player, in addition to the special "role" card each player has, injects a lot of chaos into the mix.  This is especially true as you can't guarantee you'll have the role card when your turn comes around!  A lot of the tension in the game seems to drain away, as you can usually see the winner two or three turns from the end, and do nothing about it.  Great ideas, not quite there.

RATING: 9
After only one play I really liked this a lot.  There is a lot of tension as you don't know whether your actions will be successful, depending on what your opponents do.  It rewards clever play and I definitely saw some moves made by my opponents that really surprised me!  I came in second place but saw where I could have made better choices.  Can't wait to try it again.

Update: My second play also went great. This game hits the perfect balance between depth and rules that are simple enough for new players to grasp and do well. The second game was won by a new player who made some very clever moves. The simultaneous action selection allows for some funny and surprising moments and opportunities to screw up the other players.

This is a tense medium-weight game, although it will feel heavier at first until you figure out how to avoid screwing yourself.  This is a game where even if you're not winning, as long as you're diligent, you can keep in the running.  If you find yourself always one step behind then you're in trouble.  At some point during the game, you'll need to sacrifice the current scoring round to set up for the next one, and the person who accomplishes this most efficiently will most likely win.  I enjoy the simultaneous action planning and the potential for bluffing and doublethink.

Még mindig szeretem. Egyik kedvenc szerzőm -szerzőpárosom-. Kellően egyszerű szabályok, ugyanakkor nagy változatosság, van konfrontáció, egymás akadályozása, figyelés, taktika, stratégia, izgalom. Mi kell még? Nem véletlen a sok jelölése, díja sem: megérdemelte.
A játék: Palotákat -és házakat- építünk India városaiban. Ebből a Palota a fontos: az nyer, aki előbb megépíti mind a 7 palotáját. Ugyanakkor a városok közt közlekedni kell, utakon falvak: ahol ha nincs ház, nem lehet áthaladni, ha másé van, és nekem nincs ott, akkor fizetnem kell. Ez azért érdekes, mert csak abban a városban építhetek akár palotát, akár házat, ahol ott van az építészem. Az akció választás saját akciótárcsán, titokban 2 db-ot. S egyesével fedik fel és hajtják végre  a játékosok körsorrend szerint, amit meg az épp a játékosnál lévő karakter határoz meg.  A karaktereknek számuk -körsorrend és holtverseny feloldás-, vmint plusz tulajdonság, amit felhasználhatunk.
A városok sorban vannak kiértékelve, minden fordulóban egy másik, de az értékelés sorrendje befolyásolható, megkeverhető a saját érdekünk szerint.
Az egyes városban az ott épült elemek alapján többségi elosztású sorrend, és ez alapján pénz osztás. Midnen 1-et ér a városban, kivéve az első vagyis igazából a középre épült Palota -de nyilván aki először épít palotát, az oda épít-.
Jó, nagyon: és 5-en is játszható!!!

I played 3 times Maharaja: Palace Building in India before deciding on purchasing the game.

The mechanic of the game is a bit different from other games that I have played. It is not for everyone.

I played twice so far with my own copy. It was very enjoyable game, although one of the two times it was a 3 player game. 

A 3 player game has a bit different feel than a 6 player one, but can be ideal to get an idea of the game and how it works. With 6 players, it can be rough at times concerning some of the actions you can choose on your turn. Especially the one which lets you switch your character. It can screw up a players turn if they are tight on money.

I can't wait for the next time Maharaja: Palace Building in India hits the table again.

A wonderful offering of Kramer and Kiesling, that has many things going for it. The rules are logical and concise, and the use of the different characters and the order of victory point scoring is handled very cleverly. The visual design is simply stunning, rarely has their been a game of equally flawless designwork. And it is an interesting game full of nail-biting decisions, with even an element of travel planning thrown in for good measure. Beneath it all it is another German abstract majority-in-an-area scoring game, but it rarely gets better than this.

[2 plays] This game didn't really click with me, but might improve with more plays.  Not really crazy about the winner-take-all, race to the finish scoring, because it feels like a game that should have more complex scoring. And the whole "let's run over here and build something that's now completely useless" dynamic isn't great, but I probably don't have the right approach to it. Trying to prioritize stuff that would be useful later didn't pay off well; it seems really important to be in on the early scorings, or else you end up broke.  Maybe next time I'll try to be the wandering monk.

Hmmm, not sure what to make of this. My one play saw the early leader (who chose role #1 and built in center palace spots) pretty much stay the leader. Even after role #1 was taken away from him the rest of the game was an exercise in him waiting to finish us off. Then there's the chaotic element of hostile role swapping. I line up my turn just so (money is pretty tight) and someone comes along and takes my role away pretty much killing any plans I had. WTF?! Granted, we didn't have a bunch of role swapping (probably happened about 5 times) but it seems like an oddball mechanic. I'm pretty sure early advantage in money carries through the game and other reviews seem to agree.

***Updated***
Palyed in 2 players version, only. It is a great game, simple enough to be quickly learnt, but not so simply to be mastered. It is quite similar to a puzzle to me. A lot of options and no winning strategies that cannot be stopped. Every player can go fo his personal kind of play and have fun. Just a remark: I haven't tried this with more than 2 players, but it could possibly suffer of too much chaos from 5 players actions.

***Updated 26 april 2005***
I played it some more time and I think that it suffer of a problem in the victory conditions. I mean, the risk is that the player will go for a run to the last palace without really interact each other. Disappointing. Anyway the game is still funny, but I'll change my rate to a 7

I've played as 2 player and 4 player now.  It wasn't great for us as a 2-player but I felt that it just brimmed with potential for more players, and couldn't wait to get it on the table again (especially with some tasty samosas).  My wife played a 5 player, and they thought it was OK but not great, so I avoided playing again for a long time.  Well I just played a 4 player game and we all had a blast.  Lots of interesting decisions.  Not hard to teach, and it really moves around quite fast.  Much quicker and less A/P prone than Tikal, I believe, but maybe it was just the players.

Played 7 times. Thought it was worth getting because it played 2-5p, and has good pedigree. What I didn't know is that is essentially an 'influence' game -- which I do not like at all. Very well designed, but dry as a bone, and a mechanic I don't like. Mine's up for trade... Some thematic elements can desiguise the fact that the game is quite dry and abstract feeling. "Clever", yes, but not much fun for myself or anyone I have played it with so far (7 players and counting.) This wins a special award: "best game design for a game I don't enjoy playing". [f/trM44]

I was instantly captivated by the depth of strategy and planning involved.  Once the race for palace building is started, you must be careful never to fall behind more than one palace because catching up is nigh impossible.  However, the number of ways to help you and hinder others is such that no two turns are alike.  And I suspect, no two games play out quite the same way.  Fantastic game with tense turn angst.  A note of caution: the turn order favors the early players; do not let anyone sit on the 1st player role for too many turns in a row.  The first player starts with a substantial advantage.  Careful monitoring is suggested.

"Eurogame with screwage" was how it was described to me; the roles and actions are very Euro, and the road/village/toll mechanic reminded me of Daitou.

The game is elegant and interesting, but long. The primary victory conditions seem to have a very crude granularity that kick in on the last turn. Either you draw on palaces or there is an insurmountable palace gap.

The visitation mechanics were fascinating, though the theme didn't grab me.

A complex game worthy to be placed on level with previous Kramer games El Grande, Princes of Florence, and Tikal. A unique and interesting game with more depth than is obvious at first glance.

RATING: 8
[Planning, Blind Actions, Area Majority, Special Powers] [4P:8, 5P:8] Hm. I thought that I wouldn't like this at all due to the chaos inherent in the system, but it's not that bad. The chaos comes primarily from players choosing the "swap character" action, which can affect the turn order and access to the special abilities. If you can deal with that, it's not too bad since players can't directly affect each others' board positions (unlike in, say, El Grande). The blind actions are also something I'm not enamored of, but since in this game the players' actions are mostly independent in effect, it's tolerable. The depth of the game is sort of questionable though, since there's only one way to win (build palaces) and only one real way to get there (generate top dog cash from Maharaja scoring, the income from houses on the roads and the ATM action is dicey). Still primarily a tactical game. Would play again, particularly with the Yogi to see how banking actions would affect the game. *** UPDATE: Hey, not bad as long as people don't dither on about their actions. The only way to avoid all the chaos in the upcoming turn is to plan for the next three turns. Still haven't played a game with serious monkeying by a lot of players of the governor track, which I think is one of the keys (if not THE key) to the game. I believe Maharaja has a play ceiling, but at this point I'm still happy to play. The only concern I really have at this point is that when people get used to the strange mechanisms and inherent chaos, is that you'll end up with a Power Grid style endgame, with two or three people building out and the outcome being decided by cash. Oh well, that's why I think it's got a ceiling. *** UPDATE: In retrospect, I quite underestimated Maharaja. It's a remarkable, different design from most Eurogames and it feels fresh every time it hits the table. The Kramer/Kiesling parnership has produced a lot of very nice games, and Maharaja is no exception. This one took some time and several plays to grow on me, and now I'm very pleased that I own it. Who'd have thunk I'd think this highly of a game with a blind action selection mechanism up front? I still think that the game ending and game winning conditions could be better, and that's what's holding the game back from getting a higher rating from me. However, Maharaja's main engine is easily good enough to make it worth playing regardless. Recommended for those who look to rise above chaos and plan against all eventualities.

A great game; minor elements of the classic El Grande combined with some excellent mechanics that really round this one off.  Once again we have the agony of only being able to do a couple of actions each turn, but really needing to do three.  If you play, don't get too predictable or you will be easily manipulated by the other players (trust me, it happened when we played).

Nestas cidades nos devemos construir palácios e casa a fim de agradá-lo para que ele nos retribua com dinheiro que servirá para construir outros palácios e casas no futuro.

You can't go wrong with the Kramer/Kiesling area control/majority scoring games. Raja is, however, very unforgiving. Grave mistakes made at the beginning of the game are sure to haunt you later on, and in the same way a player who manages an early lead (usually through mistakes of the other players) is very hard to catch up to.

Finally I was able to play this Kiesling & Kramer game that I've wanted to try for awhile. On first appearance it looks rather by-the-book and straightforward, but once it gets going you can really begin to see how everything works together so intricately.  It made for quite an interesting game. The hidden action selection was a nice touch and the roles also made for some interesting decision-making. I wasn't so thrilled with the fact that it gets rather apparent by the end who the winner is going to be, making the last turn or two irrelevant. But I'm guessing when players are able to keep up with each other that the tension would be right where it should be. So- a little anticlimactic in terms of the endgame but a real decent amount of solid design in this one!

This is a fabulous game.  Relatively simple rules, lots of player interaction, tension, managible chaos, the right length.  There are also several meaniful optional rules that add components to mix things up.  Great components.  I like games with movement and this game has it.  The planning horizon is limited and the chaos prevents perfect calculation, so analysis paralysis is not a problem.  Has "outwit your opponent" possiblities and plenty of direct player interaction.  Don't use the optional "Yogi" - the base game is better.

Rating after one play.

I disliked the different architect cards, and the track for the 7 governors, or whatever they're called.  There's too much chaos, and not enough control.  I should play it again to be fair, but I had very little fun the first time.  The board does look nice, though.

RATING: 5
For it's simplicity, it packs a lot to think about. The character cards/powers coupled with the ability to switch the order up makes for some interesting twists to a game that is otherwise spent following one another around the board to score points by placing palaces & houses.

Excellent majority game with nice twists. Of course, there's lots of interaction.
Unlike many others I don't think this is chaotic. Sure, other players can do quite nasty things to you but that never really ruins your game. And most of the time the screwing of other players isn't for it's own sake but also good move to yourself. Like interaction should be. 
Very recommended.

A clever design.  A player doesn't need the most points or money to win.  A player only needs to be the first to build seven palaces.  A great strategy game that requires the player to take only two actions in order to get the points that will get the gold to build the palace.  My favorite game.

Really interesting game with an unusually entertaining basic mechanic. I'd happily just play this game without even thinking of winning. Nicely combines resource management, reacting to constantly changing situations and a dose of good-natured screwage.

After falling behind early, I could see no way to catch up.  I had less resources than others, my buildings were in the wrong spots, and so on.  A very unenjoyable experience, probably my worst new game of the year.

Even with that aside, I wouldn't play again because I don't find this type of decision making interesting or enjoyable.  Most of the decisions revolved around trying to "jump ahead" of the other players, on the board or in turn order or whatever.  I dislike the simultaneous-choice mechanism in most cases, and I can't think of a K&K game I've enjoyed at all.

In my first game of this, it felt my brain was going to explode. The game can be a quite a bit chaotic and that made it feel really heavy at first, when you tried to optimize your game. But our second experience was way better because I think most of us got the idea that you have to play a little more conservative to not to be screwed by the chaos. If you are greedy, you probably will probably come crashing down by something some other player decides to do. One of the best Kramer (and Kiesling) games IMO.

"Hidden action selection wheel in Maharaja - this is where each player chooses two generic actions at the start of a round, then when it gets to your turn, you HAVE to use those actions. The good thing about it is that the actions have a few ways they can be used - you might 'build a palace' but it doesn't force you to build it in any one city... so as the last player, you can make an action selection that's flexible enough to be useful no matter what everyone else does. It's what makes Maharaja a spectacular game."

RATING: 8
Played 5+ 2,4&5 player. 90 mins. The games I have played have not been great but I felt it had potential. By mid game the leader can have already been established with nothing the other players can do about it. I am sure this is only a problem when a number of new players are involved. *UPDATE* I think it is at its best with the full complement of 5 players. A very "EURO" design. My desire to play is going up which is a good sign. July 05

*UPDATE* 10th play after a gap of several years. Opening bidding rounds are not new player friendly in any game and this is no different. We dealt out the character cards randomly to avoid this which did give and advantage to the person dealt the lowest number character. If this gets to the table again I will probably make start money equal to 10 plus your character number. I would not use the opening bidding round because it will take up a disproportionate amount of time for what it brings to the play. May 2012

Great game, now i have more games under my belt, i've corrected the rating from 8 to 8.5 (maybe it should be a 9). It has no luck factor. It has questions like "Do you go for short-term profit or long-term profit?". You have to predict the actions of the other players or gamble a little bit that actions of previous won't screw your posibilties. If i had the stones in the last game i could have won in the 9th round with the only one to have built 7 palaces and chose to play safer actions because of the angst of my predections that the other players would steal my posibility to build the 7th palace (and thus giving them 2 coins) which they didn't and that's why i became second because the winner had 4 coins more then me after round 10 ... :(

Flawless design with a mix of mechanics that work very well. It is a race to build palaces, but the players must also build a collective network of houses to get to the cities, where they gain the needed money via area majorities scoring. Characters with special powers add some spice. There is a bit of chaos and uncertainty with the simultaneous action selection, but the game has no randomness after setup and is quite strategic.

RATING: 8
I'm not sure what to think about this game.  On a basic level I really enjoyed my one play of it (I fairly sure we played with the role everyone says not to, but didn't find it over the top).  

I LOVE area majority games.  This one is fun because you are fight for majority in several places and also competing for the order (and therefore when) they are scored.

Plus there is 'role selection'  Some are powerful, but like all games of this nature, even the 'weaker' ones can be game changers if planned for.

But, ultimately it's not a 'great' game for me.  It's ultimately a race to 7 points (or was it 9?).  There just doesn't seem to be enough granularity there for me.  When everyone finishes within 'one point' instead of 10 or 20 points, I somehow feel cheated.

I know, I know.  Impressing a governor, seeking favor with the head accountant, beating the bishop, etc. are lame concepts.  But this is a fun euro that has plenty of room for creative strategy.

It's a good game, plays surprisingly fast as I thought some players might end up in a desicion block, but still things went very smoothly. It definitely was worth the SdJ nomination, it's equally non-surprising that TtR got it though as that one is clearly a more family oriented game. This one is good, very good, but it is a brainburner where you have to anticipate or at least prepare for a worst case at the same time as you try to screw your opponents as much as possible.

The Yogi character card (extra actions) is apparently broken, so don't play with that variant.

I once played this game with the "auctioning off the characters at the beginning" variant -- remember to gang up on whoever gets the #1 card, else you're in trouble.

I generally like playing with the "block off (5-(# of players)) palace spaces in each city" rule.  It's also fun to play with the "character card of the current city gets a bonus point towards scoring that city" variant, although it's easy to forget to apply that rule!

It's generally better to pick the governor track action when you have a high-numbered character card, and hence can provide a surprise new destination for next round when it's too late for other players to react.  And selecting the governor track action twice in the same turn can be a surprising and powerful move.  

There is a timing aspect to this game -- if you're at 6 palaces, you want to go first in the last round, pick the "build a palace" action, and maybe the "change characters" action to build the palace for 9 gold instead of 12.  If you have 5 palaces and 24 gold, you want to pick two "build a palace" actions, and may want to go first to build them before someone else can win.

If Power Grid and Puerto Rico had a love child, this might be it. This game melds many of the mechanics from the latter two, notably variable powers, network building, economy building, and throws in its own little spice via simultaneous action selection (à la K&K Action Points - 2 in this game) to make it a game of controlled chaos (read: chaos, not luck. In other words, an entirely non-random game with elements which are difficult to predict). I almost as a rule greatly enjoy Kiesling and Kramer's gamey offerings - this game offers the usual open game feeling that many of their other games do (e.g., the Mask Trilogy) such that you always have limited actions at your disposal but what you can do with them is deeply creative, allowing for very clever and (under)cutting play. Because nothing is written in stone, and even the player order can change within a turn, you never quite know what to expect from other players, nor entirely what you can or cannot do until you're in the midst of it (this is especially true if a route gets entirely cut off and you can't even afford to take an alternate one, or if there isn't one at all!). There are multiple strategies that are effective here, but it is important to keep one's eye on the ball -- money is a means in this game but not an end. 

It is also worth noting that Phalanx games has produced an absolutely gorgeous game that has made for some of the best game photographs on the 'geek.

The unfortunate downside of this game is that, in my opinion, this game does not flex well across its player counts. This is definitely a more the merrier type game.

This game ticks many boxes for me.  I love the fact that there are no victory points; simply build all of your palaces first to win.  I love the fact that there are no random elements during the playing of the game - only the uncertainty of your opponents' choices of action.  Finally, I love the way that all actions for a turn are selected simultaneously and can then be executed in any order during your phase.  Designed by the same people who have contributed to Tikal, El Grande and The Princes of Florence, it amazes me that this one seems less popular.

This is a "10" after one play.  Maharaja is just the kind of game I love - an area control game with lots and lots of rule bending options.  There is definitely lots going on, but not in an overly complex way, and it all comes together in a very fun way.  Our game came down to the second tie breaker for the win.  My girlfriend won - good for her!  It was very exciting.  I traded this, Medina, Wyatt Earp, and Medici vs. Strozzi, for my over-priced copy of Roads and Boats.  Maharaja alone is a far better game than Roads and Boats in my book.  What a deal!  I can't wait to play again.

(Comment in Spanish / Comentario en español)

Rajá es uno de mis juegos favoritos. Daré mis razones:

1.- El tablero y los componentes son de altísima calidad, lo que favorece sumergirse en el ambiente que el juego propone. Las piezas son de madera, los palacios son cuencas de cristal de colores y el tablero y las fichas de personaje están fabricadas para durar. La caja no contiene apenas aire. Yo tengo la edición alemana (Phalanx) y, repito, es de calidad. El juego no depende del idioma, basta bajarse de BGG las reglas en castellano.

2.- La mecánica es sencilla. Por dar una idea general diré que el objetivo consiste en ser el primero en construir 7 palacios. El Maharajá visita en un orden aleatorio, preestablecido al comienzo de la partida, las 7 ciudades del reino. Cada jugador es un arquitecto. En las ciudades se pueden construir casas y palacios, pero lo que más puntúa es construir en el centro de la ciudad. Para llevar a cabo esta tarea, el arquitecto necesitara dinero y la ayuda de alguno de los  personajes del juego, cada uno con distintas habilidades.
 
3.- No hay una estrategia única, sino muchas. Hay una alta interacción entre los jugadores, pues en su turno pueden intercambiar personajes con otros, modificar rutas, adelantarse en el turno, alterar el orden en que el Maharajá visitará las ciudades... Esto obliga a tener en cuenta a los demás y a intentar prever sus acciones para desbaratarlas y asegurarse las propias.

4.- Cada partida es distinta a la anterior. El objetivo es siempre conseguir dinero para construir antes y más que los demás, pero el punto de inicio es distinto en cada partida y el transcurso está muy influenciado por la forma de jugar del resto de jugadores. Hay que hilar fino.

5.- Un aspecto que alguno critica de este juego es el alto grado de aleatoriedad. En mi opinión, no es exactamente así. No hay un factor suerte, como en otros juegos, que dependa de conseguir ésta o aquella carta o determinado resultado de dados; lo que prima por encima de todo es la capacidad de adaptación a las circunstancias y la perspicacia para anticiparse a los demás. No es un juego tipo "Aventureros al tren" donde puedas trazarte un objetivo y esperar a obtener las cartas necesarias para llevarlo a término. Este juego encierra una fuerte interacción, lo que obliga a decidir en cada turno. No se trata de improvisación, sino, repito una vez más, de adaptación.

¿Por qué no lo he puntuado con 10? Porque puede llegar a ser un poco lento si hay sentado en la mesa algún jugador indeciso, de estos que piensan y repiensan todo sin acabar de decidirse... nada que no pueda resolverse con un reloj de arena que limite un máximo de tiempo.

En resumen, Rajá es un juego apasionante, con fuerte interacción entre los jugadores y multitud de opciones en cada partida. Si lo que quieres es una tarde tranquila y desprovista de tensión, no es el juego que estás buscando :D.

[Play with 4-5 players, possibly 3][~90 mins][Hidden action selection / role selection / route connection / race to build stuff]

I really like that the winning condition isn't "most victory points".  The advanced variants are cool too.

But now I think I've played it enough.

Drier than the Indian dust. I can see why some would like this game, but I simply don't find it enjoyable. The theme and gameplay just feel 'weird' somehow with plenty of chaotic governor and character swapping to lay waste the most careful plans. The first to 7 palaces end condition arrives too suddenly and always feels distinctly unsatisfactory.

This is an interesting and complex economic area control game with several twists.  Players spend the game attempting to accumulate money by building palaces and also in order to build palaces. Clever twists: Players can change the the order in which cities are evaluated to give themselves an advantage, and each player has a role that confers a special ability--but these roles can also be exchanged among players.  And then there's the little matter of extorting money from other players with tollbooths.

There's plenty here to keep me intrigued, and in short, the game is brilliant. (1 play)

Wow!  Seems fairly simple after reading the rules but the strategy runs pretty deep when you are actively playing.  I love the tie breaking mechanic in that the less powerfull your character is, the more likely they will be the victor of a tie! This makes your choices even more agonizing since the more powerfull character you choose has a relatively more likely chance to have his plans thwarted by opponenets!  Suffers a bit from brain paralysis. The base game also suffers a bit from chase the leader on the Mogul's first turn but this is rectified with the bidding option on the advanced game.

I find the interaction between trying to meet the current targets while also being able to alter the future targets very intriguing. I'm not a fan of the optional character 7 as it makes it almost always worth doing a "change character" action. Also, with only 3 players where is not enough contention for the villages.

RATING: 7
Simple rules create complex gameplay. Has almost no downtime, everyone seems to be involved all the time. I like the zero luck element (no cards or dice), but enough randomness is created through player actions so it won't get boring. Maharaja is a great classic eurogame. It is different enough from El Grande, but the same ingenouity shines through.

Me gustó probarlo tras largo tiempo sin jugar al quemado Ciudadelas y me encontré con mejores sensaciones. Combina "planificación de rutas" + "economía ajustada" + "elección de roles" + "planificación de accciones simultáneamente" con el resultado de un juego de suficiente profundidad táctica y caos controlado (menudo oxímoron). Lo mejor: planificación siciliana (Vizzinni de "La Princesa Prometida"). Sencillote (no apto para novatos pero si para ocasionales) Lo peor: el posible A/P que esto puede generar. Caótico para ser un Eurogame.

This is the first game I’ve bought that gives me analysis paralysis. What’s happening on the governor track, how am I going to move from point A to point B, is there going to be enough money in my coffer for the next round, which two actions will I choose, should I switch characters? There is definitely no shortage of options for such a seemingly simple game. Although I apparently have no skill at this game, I really enjoy playing it.

This is a gamer's game in that there is a lot going on, and it can be very unforgiving.  At the beginning of each round you commit to a plan by selecting actions on an action dial. There is no luck, however, there is a lot of multiplayer chaos, so by the time your turn comes around the situation on the board may be quite different.  If you have not allowed for such changes you may find that you cannot take your planned actions.  On the other hand, the game uses a lot of interesting game mechanisms (none really new though) and combines them well.  Game play is fairly quick (although it is subject to analysis paralysis by slow players), has many options to consider each turn, and is fairly intense.

Very enjoyable first couple of games with four players. Relatively simple rules, but a lot to think about when playing. The multiple functions of the character cards (play order, special abilities, determining winner of a tie in scoring) really add spice to the game. Although the theme is just a thin veneer, the components are quite nice. My one significant criticism is that a single poor decision can cost a player the game.

RATING: 8.5
Character selection, resource management, and area control.  This is a great game!  Hint: Don't let the starting player get first choice of characters for cheap.  The first player to act in the game typically has a huge advantage in placing a central palace in the first stop of the Maharaja.  Use the player order auction variant provided in the back of the rules, and pay a few bucks to act first.  My brother owns a copy.

RATING: 9
Initial rating 2 players, there could be a couple of slight issues but not sure yet, needs more plays and also more players to know for sure but I like the mechanics, tactics and strategy involved. This is one game that will need several plays before knowing where it sits for sure, even more so than most others but I think I have it close, could be 8.5 or 9.

I did not know who the designer was when we started playing but when I seen the components and heard the explaination of gameplay I knew right away. There are some familiar mechanisms from both Grande and Handler which is good IMHO and this is also a Gamer's game to be sure. Some don't like the blind action selection as it adds chaos, especially with 3 or more and I agree but this is no different than not getting your choice in EG due to turn order, though it could be worse here not sure yet. However the other thing it also adds is some really cool intrigue and you can never tell for sure what is going to happen but its your job to anticipate it as good as possible and react accordingly (again like EG).

I think 3 will be the sweet spot, then 2, then 4 or 5 but I'm not sure and I do think I won't like the chaos at the higher numbers. It does seem the #1 character is too powerful in the first half of the game and #7 is too good through the whole game, however knowing this will change my gameplay significantly for the future, question remains for now, will it matter.... 

[u]UPDATE:[/u]8.5 => 9 CHAOS!!! While being somewhat of a control freak and typically frowning heavily on chaos, Kramer seems to be able to mold a pretty chaotic game into a beautifully excuted and balanced strategy game full of tension, tactics and intrigue (like EG) earning the unofficial title, "The King of Chaos". 

I have now played twice with 5 players and I was right about playing 3 to 4 games before judging this (and wrong about player numbers, 4 and 5 are both good as well) and I recommend others do the same and ENSURE you have the rules correct as well. Especially important is being able to pick whatever character you want even from another player (this is the regular rule, variant II suggests an entice rule which can mean NOT getting the character you want), not being able to in my first games made me feel very powerless over my own plans really adding chaos to an already chaotic game. Oh yeah, characters 1 and 7 are quite powerful but not imbalaced and knowing this does change your play if you choose. 

AS with EG, the chaos (not knowing which character you will start with, how much money you might have, where the Maharaja will move to etc.) while not controllable becomes much more predictable with more plays (oxymoron predictable chaos?) or anticipatable if you will but make no bones about it planning can still be a real bitch and talk about tension! So while you do chart a course that can encounter some 'obstacles', after a few games you are more prepared for them when they hit and they do seem to effect everyone evenly as well which shows through in all of my games being very close at the end. I do think Verandi has a good point about spending so many actions just building palaces that you have little other choices but it is a small flaw on this otherwise 'GEM' of a game. 

Overall another great strategy Gamer's game with lots going on hense another Kramer masterpiece, put on your thinking cap and anti-chaos boots, grab a surf board and chart a path through them there waves of diaster!

RATING: 7
Exciting. Ideal for 3-4 players. Players represent Rajas in India, who are competing to building structures in cities that will pay off when the Maharaja comes to visit. The pay off is invested in further structures. Structures include houses in villages (which earn a "toll" fare when other players move through), and houses/palaces in cities. The player who constructs the most palaces wins the game. The base rules are quite simple, however the interaction between the two secret actions chosen each turn by each player, in addition to the special "role" card each player has, injects a lot of chaos into the mix. This is especially true as you can't guarantee you'll have the role card when your turn comes around! Quite different from other Kramer/Kiesling games, the chaos fans who enjoy their games to be a ride (ie. Bruno Faidutti type games) will likely love it. A lot of the tension in the game seems to drain away, as you can usually see the winner two or three turns from the end, and do nothing about it. Great ideas, not quite there.

RATING: 9
A lot going on here. Very confusing the first few turns and then the light clicks on. What I like is that while there is screw potential, you can take steps to counter such possibilities.

Edit: I finally won a game of this, after about 5 plays. I mention this not just from a pride standpoint :-), but that to win against good players you must combine creativity with efficiency. And to do that, you must evaluate what other people are going to do (or, equally important, NOT do.)

Upgraded my rating. Creative chances throughout the game blend beautifully with resource management, opponent prediction and damage control. Well integrated roles and actions. Nice components and board. Big thumbs up.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (May 2015)

I didn´t know what to expect but I really liked Raja: Palastbau in Indien (Maharaja: The Game of Palace Building in India). I have a tremendous respect for Wolfgang Kramer and that was the reason I bought the game in the first place.

As I have the game in German, it was very hard to get the rules online (this shouldn’t happen these days), I only got some summaries, but a German speaking friend confirmed we played the game with the correct set of rules.

The game has easy rules, but the decisions needed to play it aren’t trivial. It features Area Control, Role Selection and Simultaneous (hidden) Action Planning. You have to correctly guess what will happen and then plan accordingly but so much can happen between your plan and your move. Very tactical,  I really like it. 

I played only with three players, but I wouldn’t say no to a four or even five player game. It moves at a fast pace.

It is weird that you can interrupt one action to do another and then finish the first one, so far this is the only game I have seen this.

When I transport the game, its components become very disorganized, so I had to toss the insert (it pained me a bit), it was gorgeous but useless.

On the other hand, I have a minor issue. I’m worried that catching a runaway leader can be too hard.

Bottom line, Raja: Palastbau in Indien is a keeper for me. I think it has a lot of probabilities of getting an improved rating and I want to play it again soon.

Complex interactions in this game. Claim routes between cities which mean you can travel cheaper, build houses and palaces in the cities such that you benefit but only when the Maharaja eventually visits that city. Special powers, blind simultaneous action selection, tight resource management, area majority.

I bought this by accident instead of Taj Mahal.  Seems ok if we played with more playes, but we only played once and only with two. It dragged waaaay too long.

Update: We finally got around to playing a second game, again with two. Actually it's not as dry (with two) as we first thought, AND play went much faster.

Update with 5: Nice! (Got my goose cooked well and truly.) I now have less regret about this accidental acquisition.

So this game feels similar to Taj Mahal in choosing your battles, and El Grande in spreading your influence.

The first play felt strange, though.  We played with the first advanced rule, and it seems that the only proper way to play is for everyone to take the "change character" action to get the Yogi's extra action.

I want to play again, but I'm skeptical of this game ever entering my top list.

RATING: 8
After playing the game I have found that some of the derogatory comments made here appear to be unfounded... or slightly exaggerated.  The 'Wandering Monk' problem still exists but, unless you have a 'Kingmaker' in your crowd, it should never come up in actual game play.

The game seems to be a little dry and it plays a little long.  It is probably be best played with 5 players.

As long as you don't try to compete in every city, you should do well in this game.  The tricky part is knowing in which cities to compete.  I find that some of the extra 'optional' rules tend to make the game imbalanced, especially when playing with the 7th role, so we usually play with the basic ruleset.

After a few more plays, my rating has gone up again.  The subtle manipulation of the turn order and other actions have significant effects on play that finally show themselves after repeat plays.  Typical of Kramer games is the fact that you always want to do more than the number of actions you are given.

It's ok.  I thought I would like it more than I eventually did.  I like the fact that you can earn rewards by other players using your houses, but it didn't affect the game as much as I thought it would.  The roles also weren't as distict a factor as say in puerto rico, and in the end, while the game is ok, I'd probably rather play something else in my collection.

Oooh, feel the brain burn. So many choices and the constant worry that someone will yank the rug out from underneath you. I really upset the applecart when I spent one turn using both of my actions to move a region down the governor track so it would score again the following turn. No one else saw it coming! I came out on the wrong end of some surprise moves as well. 

Great interaction--steal player cards away, move houses off a road to spoil another player's travel plans, rearrange the order of the scoring regions. I'd play this again if only to better wrap my head around it.

Neat game of simultaneous action planning. You have to not only decide what you want to do on your turn but what you think the players going before you are going to do and how that may affect your turn. There are plenty of things to consider during the planning phase of each round. The game is usually very close at the end.

It's a neat game. Very typical euro in that you always want to perform more actions than you are allowed. Money greases the wheels and here's where I see a potential issue with the game. Payouts between the top majority in a city and the lowest is very large (13 vs. 1). I suspect players who do well in the first couple of cities are much better positioned to win the game than those who start slowly. If you have money, it is easier to build palaces and keep that money going. If you get low on cash, you become much less competitive in the scoring and it can be hard to get back in the game. I don't know if this is a flaw, but I know I was low on funds for a few turns and the action choices are so limiting that it's difficult to come up with really creative plays to make up ground faster. 

REVISITED in 2016: Beautiful board. Strong game play. The limited choices allow more creativity that I'd originally thought. However, I just don't find it that fun. The few actions you take in a game make it feel somewhat undynamic. Maybe just not to my tastes these days. There are many classic Euros I'd choose ahead of this.

RATING: 9.2
Great game. High 8. I can see the DNA of Kramer/Kiesling/Tikal in this game, but although I can tell it's Tikal's cousin, it doesn't feel like I'm playing a retread. Maybe one way to describe it is the same feeling you get when you see a great new movie by one of your favorite directors. I love Tikal, and I love this one; it felt fresh and exciting.

Nice components. I like the glass gems for the palaces, and how the palaces eventually build up. It's neat how the "scoring track" is actually embedded in the palace structure of the board (and a summary can be taken in at a glance of everyone's remaining gems).

Mechanics-wise there are a lot of fun parts to explore, with the simultaneous action selection (reminiscent of El Grande but used more frequently here), the governor track, the special characters.

One minor concern that is keeping this from being a 9 right-off-the-bat, and keeps it from being an immediate must-buy, is that everyone was one turn from winning when one player won. One of my quibbles with Blue Moon City is that nearly every time I play, *every* player is one turn away from winning at the end, which is vaguely dissatisfying; it's as if something is a bit off with the granularity of the scoring. This might have been a fluke in this first play of Maharaja, further plays will tell.

I'm also not sure how I feel about the Yogi. I'd like to try without him and I have a feeling I might like it better; more flexibility to explore the options themselves without adding a kind of "recursive" element of repeating some of them. (and being forced to do that otherwise you'll fall behind)

Update: Bumping up to a 9.  2nd game was a close one but not as close, only one player (me :-) ) was able to win on the turn I did.

Folks both at the table and beyond have described this as a gamer's game.
While I can't disagree, I found it to be more easygoing than expected, and
not at all a brainburner.  In my mind, Maharaja could have plausibly come
from Michael Schacht, and is much less filling than, say, Tikal.

The essence is a majority game with a travelling game.  The majority control issues, and the rules which always change the scoring
city gave some of the flavors of El Grande and Wongar, while the need to
travel everywhere had a slight hint of Elfenland.  This is not a blazingly
original game, but it's effective, and the use of the special powers adds
additional variety and tactics to every turn.

This is a very strong 6 for me. The game is actually very well designed and mechanically it makes a lot of sense and works well. It just falls flat for me. I find it too dry and analytic with no real theme holding it together. I just don't enjoy the experience of playing this.

There's a more clear complaint I have with the end of the game where it's usually clear a few turns before the end who has no hope of winning and often it can be clear who is going to win but you have to play it out anyway.

Raja is the rare exception of a game that is sold off for years but is a good game. Phalanx Germany really messed up on this with a massive overproduction. It's an action selection game with the ultimate goal to be the first player to build his 7 temples. In order to do so, players have to earn a lot of money which is mostly done by having either more influence in the city scored that turn or building houses on key connections on the board forcing other players to pay for transit. Although each player only has two actions per turn and the game lasts a maximum of 10 rounds, there's a lot of choices what to do and moves can get quite complex once the board positions are build up a bit. Need to play more to understand its depth.

Just a provisional rating. A very nice-looking board and set of bits, and a pretty easy-to-master set of operations. I kind of botched my first play, which is almost certainly keeping my rating down at the moment, but the game is a bit arid and bears a few too many similarities to El Grande for total comfort.

Each turn there are more actions that you want to do than you can do, which provides a nice tension. Because the city order and your characters can be changed, there is a good deal of chaos. Long term strategy seems difficult... you must be more reactive and anticipate other players' moves. Too much brain burn for my enjoyment.

RATING: 8
Initial play with 3 players.  Initially I had my doubts about the game, but the whole experience came together quite nicely, gathering steam towards the end for a very dramatic finish.  I can see how this would be quite chaotic with 5, it seems like 4 might be the ideal number of players.  I can see how the simultaneous action selection can be bothersome to some players, but I find it enjoyable, and the risk is still manageable.  The components are very nice and pleasant to use, and this feels different than most other games.  I'd definitely like to play this more.  

Update: Have enjoyed this with four players, it seems to move a little faster, and the competition is a little fiercer.  Moved rating up to an 8.

RATING: 7.5
A heavier, more chaotic version of Elfenland mixed with El Grande. Its partly area-control and partly travel, and players have to maximize the efficiency of their travel around the board. 

A nice mix of mechanics, but it does feel too chaotic at times. I don't think there's much long term strategy, instead its more about taking advantage of what you can do on your turn.

Excellent game. Just raised to 10 after a few more sessions! Great combination of strategy, planning & tactics. Play early in the session as this is a real brain-burner...the only achilles heel is that some players can become bogged down with analysis paralysis

High-quality components and lots of hard decisions and options from which to choose. It feels like there is even a bit too much to do and learning how to play well takes a lot of time. The end of the game is a bit like a fast and furious anticlimax.

Always fun even though I still haven't won a game!!! Definately this deserves a top spot in my collection. Edit: I've played 11 times and I still haven't won but I'm getting closer! Edit: new stategy has become apparent - will try it the next time. Edit tried strategy, it worked nice, just not well enough. I'll beat this game...Edit I FINALLY WON!!! I took a while but it did happen. I was weighted in my favor I think (I ended the game with 5 central palaces!). Looking forward to more wins! Edit: Won again - This time with stiffer competition (the first time was very hard as well), but now it was 4 player. Yeah! A true win! (One of the most interesting road wars ever played!) Edit: 3 player offers a very good game as well and adds some new strategies. Nice

It is a gamer's game, but not overly taxing.  Planning is paramount.

[LUP 29-Nov-2006] Lessons learnt from my first play - 1) Do not let Frank get ahead in palaces.  2) [b]Really[/b] don't let Frank get ahead in palaces, you won't catch up!  After second play there is a chance of catching up, but it is still not wise to let someone get ahead.  Made much more use of the character cards in our second play.

This is one of a series of new games I have acquired that has risen nearly to the top of my list.  It is deep, with beautiful components, and beautiful mechanics.  I have played it with 2, 3, and 4.  My first game was with 2 and I definitely need to play again to form an opinion on it since I didn't really know what I was doing, but with 3 is was great and with 4 it was absolutely marvelous.  Always feel like you are one action short of what you need to do, and the SAS allows for some terrible moments where you must reevaluate plans on a moments notice.  Absolutely brilliant.

edit: After repeated plays I have determined this to be one of the best games I own.

2018-01-31 - 6 - My rating is based on a game with 3 players and I really think that it is better with more. It's a german style eurogame with quite a lot of interaction, variable player powers (which can be stolen from others!) and simultaneous action selection. There are clever concepts here and possibilities to mess with other players plan. 
My play started promising, but ended rather flat because the map was not crowded enough. 
I hope I will be able to play it with higher number of players and increase my rating.
I suppose if it was published in a style of Five Tribes or Yamatai it could be a huge hit even now (although people want games that work well with 2 and 3 nowadays).

Finally played this one...it's a pretty good game.  Each turn you simultaneously select two actions of about 9 or 10 choices.  This creates a little downtime as you want to do everything and it's tough to pick just two.  I suggested a 30 second timer to help keep the game going. Nothing truly special about this title but it is enjoyable and one I'd like to explore further.

Run all around India building palaces and making money. Very smart turn system allows you to plan your route many turns in advance, unless someone rearranges the order! My only grievance is with the yogi and action chits. By becoming the Yogi and the Mogul (Advanced Version rule) a player can consistently get an additional action, and cannot have the yogi stolen from him. If an opponent uses a turn stealing the yogi, you can simply retrieve the yogi with the extra action, and get another extra action chit. To put it another way, the Yogi is too powerful!

At least for now, I really enjoy the tension and jockeying for position.  I think people can fall too far behind in points to really catch up; the game seems a bit unforgiving of mistakes or poor planning.  Fortunately, it's still a pretty fun game to play with enough players.  I have the impression that it might feel a bit too chaotic when played by players of a higher and more equal level of skill.

RATING: 7
Good game. The best part of the game are those characters with their unique skills and the programming-phase: if you are in the last place to play, it's not 100% sure, that you can do what you were planning, if someone steals your character before your turn comes. That makes your planning more difficult and (IMO) funnier. I've played the game with 4 and 5 and I think both works very well. Good game, if there aren't any analysis-paralysis guys in the playing group!

One play.  Better than I expected, given I really dislike the Tikal, etc., series of games.  Still, the game was fairly in hand for the eventual winner 3 or 4 turns before the game was over.  I actually suspect this will often be the case for this game.  But the rampant chaos and untrustworthiness of long term plans of other similar games wasn't as bothersome for this game (see El Grande for such a game).

This is an average euro game. Like most euro games, it's more like an abstract game with a theme. What is surprising is that there is no victory point system which makes it slightly different than the other games.

Else it's pretty simple, try to build stuff in the scored city which is going to give you money to fuel other construction. I managed to place 1 temple every turn except 1 and I won the game.

There is a lot of actions you can do, but many of them are either redundant or always never used unless you arrive very short in money.

Each player have a special power and initiative number. Players who play last have stronger powers, but apparently playing first is only good in the first half of the game, but it's not really an advantage near the end of the game. So there is probably a balance issue here.

An area-influence game that reminds me of a cross between mechanisms from El Grande and Taj Mahal.  The game seems very interesting but is longer than I would prefer given what it is (an action pts sys).  Has a bit of downtime.  Alternatively, you could decide to play til 6 palaces, instead of 7 as stated in the rules.

After one play, its certainly interesting all the different twists that can occur in the game.  The best laid plans can easily be destroyed if one does not go first in the turn as people exchange roles with you or knock the governors around on the scoring track.

A grafikája szerintem nem lenyűgözően szép, de a mechanikája nagyon ott van! Két játékos volt az ismerkedő játékomban, de úgy nem igazán jött be. Három játékossal viszont élvezetes, gondolkodós, metajátékos játék! Kifejezetten sokrétű a mechanikája, a játékosok folyamatosan hatnak egymásra, minden állandó változásban van a táblán, és nehéz kitalálni, hogy ki mit tervez vajon tenni, és nekem mi lenne a jó, és ezek függvényében milyen cselekvést válasszak a körömre. Nehéz, de jó játék, sok lehetőséggel. Inkább komolyabb, matematikához közel álló gondolkodású embereknek való elsősorban, nem pedig könnyed kikapcsolódást keresőknek.

NOTE: Rating based on one play, with four players.

This game has some intriguing strategic and tactical consequences.  At first I was worried that the hidden role selection mechanism was going to completely hose any viable strategy, but it doesn't.  In my opinion, a nice blend of mechanisms seen in other games.  Component quality is high.  Would definitely play it again.

One not-so-important-but-painfully-obvious problem: the "maharaja" figure looks far too similar to the architect of the black pieces.  We made a turban for it out of Kleenex as a temporary solution.  Perhaps spray painting it white, gray, silver or gold would address this.

A bit too annoyingly chaotic (which I normally don't mind, so am not sure why I do here).  While there is no luck per se, trying to discern the options of other players and the possible impact was far too difficult.  Also, there is not much to do while waiting for your turn except helplessly watch while your carefully laid plans are put to ruin.  Perhaps deserves further play, though I'm not sure it will get it.

4/2008 Based on one three player session this game was very good.  There's many well integrated mechanics requiring both long and short term planning.  In the short term you need to keep track of your funds and resources, and in the long term you need to decide what battles to stand and to let go.  Only drawback in our game was that the final out-come was obvious in the last couple of rounds.

[Played about 30 times]
Tactical choices, variable powers and scarcity of money lead to agonizing decisions.
More players make the game more interesting, but add downtime.
Simultaneous choices add outguessing and chaos.
Runaway leader issue (early cities are more likely to be visited again by the Raja, doubling their effectiveness, as if they weren't already important enough because they provied early money that can be used to build/score more thus gaining yet more money...).
Nice bits.

I consider the "advanced variant" as part of the game, and the "second advancend variant" as a good idea only for the 2-player version.

UPDATE: rating slowing but steadily declining over time (from 8 to 7, from 7 to 6).

With two five-player games after our initial test with only two, Raja is well on its way to replace St. Petersburg as my personal favorite of 2004. Rich and varied, with a tight net of possible actions and all this without complicated winning conditions or adding up lots of points - get your seven palaces built, and that's it. As far as I can tell from one game, adding the Yogi (Advisor #7) to the game without using the other advanced rules works very well.

I think that this is a good game, but I think that the game is diminished greatly if playing with the Yogi (I would rate the Yogi-game as a 5).  The Yogi makes it a much more "blah" game as the tension of choosing your actions dissappears and the game becomes more about Yogi token management.

A really fun and rich game of area control game that relies heavily on worker placement themes. The game does not have direct conflict of conquering from other people, but only a scramble to control most city districts (i.e. build a place), control road ways, control/exchange player abilities, and control the order of scoring. The worker placement theme comes in with a dial where you select 2 of several actions, which all center around resources, building, or moving your player pieces.

Christmas 2005 gift.

Excellent turn angst. Great bits.

I really like trying to predict what your opponents will do so that you can handle the change in the layout of houses and role cards without giving everyone gold because you had to renounce part of an action.

The movement of the governor on the track and the snatching of role cards makes for some fantastic brain action.

Excellent game.

This would be higher if it didn't suffer from requiring the right people to play it. Its a heavy "gamer's" game. However it is more tactial than strategic. And while some people can be prone to thinking to hard about their next turn, it really is a bit pointless as things are likely to change before then. Still with all that being said its a beautiful production and a tremendous game. Two actions are never enough to do all you wish to do. Interesting role selection with the possibility of screwing your opponents by taking their current role. A bit of attempting to outguess them with blind action selection. Some area control and route planning features. Tight, elegant game with a lot going on. Seems to scale well from 2 up.

RATING: 8
[i]Maharaja[/i] hits all the right notes for me:

- Elegant design / smooth play
- Low complexity / medium-to-high depth
- 60-90 minutes
- Variable setup (Maharaja scoring order)
- Low luck
- No bullshit catch-up mechanisms (if you mess up, you lose)
- Plenty of ways to screw with your opponents
- Blend of strategy and tactics
- Must anticipate your opponents' future actions and choose yours accordingly

We played with tile #7 (extra action).  I would like to play without it next time.  Also, we chose new character tiles every round (in tile order from previous round), which, while interesting, is apparently not the correct way to play.

----------

Finally played again with correct character rules and without the Yogi (#7). Initial character choice is much more important. Turn order is huge. I didn't see the point of character #1 before, but if you can set up a play to move a house and block a path or win a tiebreaker it can be well worth it. Character #4 seemed overpowered, but it turns out we played it wrong. Players still get paid for their houses, just from the bank!

RATING: 8
I love 6 Nimmit, highly rated Citadels, and enjoyed the only single play of Maharaja very much (see the pattern?). I wanna play it more times!

Updated: finally played this again. A 2hrs game which didn't feel the time past. Like the first play, the end game was still not exciting and not satisfying enough. However, the process was enjoyable and I like the possibilities of creating some clever plays. It seems quite difficult to turn the tide when you are behind since you have less money to spend to re-gain the lead in the cities. Therefore, very critical to win some strategic locations in the early game.

06/30/04 Received. The Maharaja being the same color as one of the player colors (black) caused scoring confusion until I pasted a white label around his base. And it would have been nice if the palaces were really palaces (like the plastic ones in Taj Mahal) instead of Pente stones. That cost the game a rating point. Otherwise its a great game. I almost always use the Yogi (Shiva token) rule, and often the governor rule. Occasionally I've used all the optional rules, but only with experienced players.  
As of 12/06/17 I've played 31 games.

RATING: 8
A very good game with quite a lot to think about. You always need to look ahead several steps and build with the goal of setting yourself up for the future while still being in a position where you can adapt to the changing landscape. The game has the reputation of being chaotic... and deservedly so in that player actions and choices can result in rounds turning out much differently than first anticipated... but being positioned in such a way as to be able to react better than your opponents is where this game is won and lost. It's  about optimizing every action in such a way that even when your plans need to change radically... you will still benefit more than your opponents will collectively. The game also has the reputation of having a runaway leader problem... but this again I think arises out of the fact that some players plan and anticipate better and therefore find themselves  "in the right place at the right time" more often than not... thus perpetuating their lead. The rule set is actually quite simple and the game play flows smoothly for a game with this much depth. This is a great game with the potential to be a "10" type of game when played by 4 or 5 very shrewd players with experience.

Area control game where players build palaces in cities and homes in cities or villages. Players must move their architect to the city to build a palace, and movement is governed by houses on the villages; you pay the owner of the home (maximum of 2 homes per village) to pass through the village.  Players choose initial starting roles which offer some advantages, then choose 2 actions per turn after to affect the board (building, earning money, and so on.) I prefer Kramer's other effort, Tycoon. This one might grow on me with more playings, but there is a certain bit of controlled chaos, such as changing the scoring of the cities or changing roles.

OK, I must admit I like this game far more than anyone else in my game group (where it really divides the crowd) and it thus gets played a bit less than deserved, but also meaning that it gets kind of a golden lining to it that may have worn off would it be the most played game. Games CAN be a bit messy to say the least, especially when trying to teach it to someone and the first few games can drag quite a bit. Now this can actually put some people off to the extent that Maharaja may never see the day of light and be sentenced to 100 years of cupboard solitude, which would constitute a grave gaming injustice because beneath a messy first game dwells a tremendously polished and refined tactical game, and in my opinion a better area influence game than El Grande. The simultaneous decision board forces some agonizing decisions and chasing/enticing the Maharaja to the cities around the board, and you are always wonderfully short of cash. I have not encountered a kingmaker problem during any play. Maharaja has all the elements in place that I demand from a great game.

This area control / area influence combinated with variable player powers is a challenging family game or a ligth gamers game. The rules are not to easy, the mechnics are fine. I've nerver had the chance to play it a litle bit nasty, because I aways played with people who doesn't remember that they played this game once or I 've played with poeple who "realy" doesn't played it befor. 
I don't want to put them of to play this game or at all that they dislike to play games (...with me ;D) in the futer, so I hold of in my plays. 

nach Hannover mitnehmen!

I think this game have a nasty-fun potantial but I've never find it out. If I ever got the afford of an opportunity I like to find it out, and may be I rate it higher because I thing this game is better than "El Grande" is and it playes in the same liga.

Chaos produced by conscious player decisions is still chaos.  The ease with which one player's turn can radically alter another's (almost invariably for the worse) makes this my least favorite Kramer game.

RATING: 6
Everyone enjoyed our first game of this, and look forward to many more plays. The chaos of hidden choices combined with the numbers battle in the scoring sites makes for a fun, yet tense game that can be played on many levels. **UPDATE** The winning condition hurts the game in my eyes - I just don't like games that end when something is accomplished and no points are scored. This discourages other strategies in my mind, and makes the game feel like it plays on rails.

The Kramer-Kiesling's game I most like. They managed somehow to solve the "waiting time" problem which affected their previous games I tried (Tikal and Java).

UPDATE
Played again in 2008. It is less nice than what I remembered. Maybe because new games in the years are becoming better and better and it loses a bit of appeal comparing it with them.

An interesting game where you are trying to build palaces and homes in the proper areas that the Maharaja will visit that turn.  There are many ways to alter where the Maharaja will visit, and many ways to assure you will receive points every turn.

Every turn each player takes there action selection disc and selects two actions they will perform for that turn.  After selecting in turn order people reveal what they chose than uses the actions.

This game has many different ways to achieve victory and was a pleasure to play.  I would welcome more plays of this one.

Essentially a racing game with a snowballing leader problem.  If you keep winning the scoring rounds, you’ll never need to look back.  Also, the game would get laughed off the table these days — it looks drab as hell, and certain colors used for the regions are too closely died for across-the-table glances.   All that said, this is a gamer’s game that rewards multiple plays to understand strategic timing.

AP prone game with a set of roles that provide special abilities. With two actions each round the players vie to get majorities in provinces that come up for scoring. Uses simultaneous action selection. Actions include building, taking away roles from other players and also altering the order of provinces to be scored.

Wow. I was blown away by this game. This seldom happens. On reading the rules, I thought "wow, this is a very good game." Then I played it. It is superb.

This game works very well with 2. Also, at 3-4 is a great game. Playing it with 5, though, is when the brain-burn kicks in and chaos rules the day. So either 2 or 4 is its "sweet spot". That being said, it seems to get better with every play (even with 5 players).

Maharaja: Palace Building in India is the first serious board game I bought. It is a game I have played a lot (though, I have not logged these plays as I did not do that in the early days). The board and components are beautiful. Making good in the game depends all on strategies and tactics. Sure, there is a lot of chaos in this game but competent players can predict what is coming. In other words you should not only be thinking your own moves by those of others as well. This is the game that really got me into board gaming. Do yourself a favor and give it a try!

Interesting game, nice mechanics.  My only concern is that opponents can play very disruptively -- changing city order, exchanging roles, etc. -- making it difficult to plan ahead productively.  Add to that the fact that it's hard to catch up when behind, and this game can sometimes be painful.  Other than the other players, however, there is almost no randomness to this game.  Rating may improve with more plays.

RATING: 8
Raja isn't a surprise for its strategic character, since Wolfgang Kramer has been releasing a steady flow of meaty games for the last couple of decades. Nonetheless, it stands out clearly among his generally high quality output for the way usual elements (area control, resource management) are blended using a relatively stripped down ruleset: every turn each player has got to squeeze as much as possible out of only two actions out of nine possible (these aren't exclusive for one player, luckily) plus the use of one or two characters out of six (seven if the advanced game is being played).

Further surprises are the almost total absence of randomness (just at determining the starting player and the order in which the cities will be evaluated, all at the start) and of the famous scoring bar ("Kramerleiste"), and the smooth scaling from 2 up to even 5 players (other of the heavier Kramer offerings can be played by 2-5 as well, but the gameplay isn't the same for any number of players).

Every little detail counts; therefore an irreversible runaway situation is possible. Nonetheless, this only happens when serious mistakes are committed and not at all with evenly experienced players. Then Raja is just flawless: easy to learn, suprisingly substantious (during the ten turns practically all the possible actions will be chosen at least once) and water tight.

RATING: 7
Gioco profondo e ben studiato. Fin troppo caotico in 5 ma, con un po' di rodagio, regala colpi di scena ad ogni giocata. Nel regolamento sono presenti alcune possibilità di variare le regole base che, se ben bilanciate, rendono il gioco anche più bello. Il regolamento in italiano invece è scritto prorpio male e da adito a diversi fraintendimenti. Sulla meccanica invece c'è da dire che una partenza sbagliata può compromettere l'intera partita e renderla noiosa e poco coinvolgente. Nel suo complesso però una partita a Raja scivola via piacevolmente e velocemente. Consigliato.

(11/09/06) Raja, of Maharaja in de nederlandstalige versie, is weer zo'n leuk Kramer spel.  Via een draaischijf bepaal je allemaal tegelijk, verdekt, je volgende stappen.  Bedoeling is zo vlug mogelijk 7 paleizen te bouwen van jou kleur.  Leuk is het item met de personages.  Elk personage heeft zo zijn voordeel.  Ook leuk de volgorde van de steden kan voortdurend worden aangepast.  Alleen spijtig dat de doos, meer bepaald de onderverdeling in de doos, niet klopt.  Blijkbaar was het geld op en heeft men een moule gebruikt dat helaas niet past voor de op te bergen stukken.  Voor een spel in die prijscategorie mag men wat beter verwachten!

RATING: 7
Rating from 1 play w/ 3 players.  Very different--more options, yet Samurai was the closest comparison to how it felt.  A series of very tactical battles toward a longer term point goal. 

I tried to be tricky and go for the 2nd city to be scored, but my sister won the first fairly easily and then had the resources to dominate the 2nd.  She went on from there and won.  Her husband and I pulled some good tactical tricks later and played even as the game wore on, but never overcame her early palace and money lead.  There is a learning curve, but one game gives you a good feel. I want to play a couple more times to see if it gets too samey for me.

An interesting game not like anything else (most similar to El Grande). There's a bit of network building, simultaneous action selection, area majority, variable turn order, special powers. 

I like the fact that you can interfere with the order in which the cities are scored, but my favourite rule has to be that if you screw up your action selection, all the other players get free money! This punishes people who don't pay attention or make decisions too hastily. Serves you right! Ha!

If I only had at most 10 decisions to make in a game lasting 2 hours, and I made those decisions without knowing what the game board and state would look like when it was my turn, or even what my special power would be by the time it got to me, and therefore each player had to sit and re-analyse when their turn came around how to make the best of their now sub-optimal decision from back at the start of the turn, I wouldn't be a happy camper with the game.

At first, based on the instructions, the game appears to be fairly simple and light, but once you get into it, there are just so many options and factors to consider that the game is quite heavy and complex. But this is all welcome. There is a lot to think about and the game is tight in all aspects; you don’t have enough houses, money or moves when you need them, so planning is critical. There is also the aspect that other peoples actions will effect you, thus play order is important, but to play early, you have to chose a character card with a weaker ability.

You have the city and road building structure of Settlers, but then you use that structure to travel around. It has the richness and complexity of Caylus, and you can play all over the board to your advantage.  

Additionally, Maharaja has an aspect of craziness that is surprisingly pleasing.  The chaos can often mess up your plans, but as it nearly always creates some avenue of opportunity, it adds more richness than frustration.  New tactical twists are revealed to me every time I play.

Wow, there's a lot going on in this game.  Has a good bit of rules complexity, but once you have everything down, this is a truly great game.  In the end it's just a race to get your palaces on the table, but in the process you have to manage activating and playing your houses (both in villages and cities), using and switching roles, and even changing the order of scoring.  A great combination of long-term planning and short-term tactics.

Challenging game of too few decisions in limited time.  I liked the action wheel and character abilities.  Every turn was a challenge of what to do with limited supplies.

Might be strongly influenced by the play group I experienced it with, but this needs to be way faster to be even remotely enjoyable. Even then, the play structure is awkward and the mix between the glass beads representing 'palaces' and the wooden buildings representing 'buildings' is odd and off-putting. Why have one be a small house model to represent a house, and then a glass bead to mean a palace? The action wheels (or whatever gay name the rules choose to call them) are totally superfluous and make me feel like a huge dork while fiddling with the tiny little compass points. There's no real play balance either. Pretty damn boring to boot.

Excellent brain burner.  Always a lot to do, always tough tough decisions.  Has the play for the moment/future elements that I really love, and, if everyone plays well, the leader can be caught.

The one downside is that I dread teaching this game and it rarely makes it out because of that.

Incredible!!  Now I see why this was SdJ nominee.  Soooo many things you want to do but can only do 2 actions per round.  CONSTANT agonizing decisions, lots of yelling & cursing from the players which is fantastic.  Reminds me alot of "Wallenstein" which is great.  People have complained about the analysis paralysis but it's not bad because all players choose their actions at the same time, so the downtime isn't bad at all - Game could be really long with 5 players however.  I didn't find this to be a real brain-burner either.  Great bits & board & production from Phalanx.  HIGHLY recommended.

Reminds me a bit of Hansa but with each player having their own token to move around the board.  The clever mechanic of only scoring the Majaraha's current palace does a good job of making players diversify.  With more players there is quite the possibility of some chaos in this game which I could see leading to analysis paralysis for players prone to it.  If this does not occur though, it's a great game.  I like the secret action selection, especially when you risk losing actions and gold if you play too agressive.

1 play with 5: like father like son, I found the descendency of El Grande here. Firstly, I prefer this to the predecessor due to the countdown of the palaces sparks my competitiveness, and the "dial up" element that I liked in ElG has been moved to centre stage. However, I found it hard to determine what the secret plays may be.

Interesting game of area control with an ingenious little wheel for selecting your two actions each turn.  The game revolves around managing to collect enough money each turn to be able to build a palace each turn. Whoever builds 7 palaces first, wins.

Initial placing of the houses is crucial. There are major chaos elements in the game: players changing the city that will be scored next and changing their "character" with someone else.

It is a race for being the first to build 7 palaces. To be able to do this, you need to optimize income at each and every turn by winning majorities in as many of the 7 cities as possible. Some tension, but because of the chaos factor it is hard to make reliable long term plans. Things could change on you unexpectedly.

Overall a decent game, but every time I play it I feel like something is missing. The ending is almost always anticlimactic - once someone is ahead by one palace build before the last round, rarely the last round makes a difference.  It is very rare to be able to build two palaces in one turn.

7 város, ahova a lehető leggyorsabban fel kell építenünk a palotáinkból hetet. Először mindenki titkosan választ két akciót, amit végre kell hajtania. Figyelem, ha nem sikerül valamelyiket, akkor a többi játékos kap a bankból 2 pénzt. És ugyebár a pénz mindig jól jön... Nekem így ment el a játék, mivel az egyik körben "nulláztam", a többiek pedig kaptak +2 aranyat, szóval erre különösen oda kell figyelni!
Ahhoz, hogy egy palotát meg tudjunk építeni, ahhoz ki kell építeni egy utat, vagy használni a mások által megcsináltat, de ez pénzbe kerül, ráadásul minden szakaszért akár kettőbe, szóval jó, ha előre gondolkodunk.
A karaktereknek számuk -körsorrend és holtverseny feloldás-, vmint plusz tulajdonság, amit felhasználhatunk.
A városok sorban vannak kiértékelve, minden fordulóban egy másik, de az értékelés sorrendje befolyásolható, megkeverhető a saját érdekünk szerint.
Az egyes városban az ott épült elemek alapján többségi elosztású sorrend, és ez alapján pénz osztás. Minden 1-et ér a városban, kivéve az első vagyis igazából a középre épült Palota -de nyilván aki először épít palotát, az oda épít.

In this game, you are trying to be the first to build all your glass tokens in the cities on the board. Doing so, requires you to get money and that's where this game gets interesting. Each turn someone walks across a town on a road where they don't have a house, they pay a dollar to each player that does have a house. Additionally, each turn ONE of the cities pays out big time in terms of dollars. It is another majority scoring but it has at least some payout for each of the 5 players who could have built into that city. I said before the key to the game is cash, so it's critical to predict and try to control which city gets scored next. Each player has a dial where they lock in their actions and reveal in turn order and of the actions is change the order of scoring the towns. This game also has tiles players get that give them unique powers in the round. This game was so so impressive. A very aggressive and interesting twist on route building and area control.

It seemed to me that planning for near term monetary gain (houses on villages to be used the following turn) while building palaces as soon and as often (every turn?) as possible (like San Juan buildings) is the only way to go (aka follow the leader). Planning too far ahead and the game will be over before your payoff occurs. I also wonder if chosing the character roles anew each turn might be a better way to go (ala Puerto Rico).

RATING: 9
A really excellent gamers game.

Simple rules with complex game play and a few unexpected developments depending on other players actions.

With your two actions per turn, only the first player can be sure he can do what he wants, but later players have compensating increasing benefits from their (temporary) character card.

Wow, it isn't often I give a '10' to a game, but this one richly deserves it. The dovetailing of the various systems is seamless and flawless. Hardly any luck at all, and yet a lot of surprises. The components are top-notch. The only minor quibbles are that it does not have a custom designed insert for the components and the maharaja probably should have been white to differentiate it from the black player piece.
  Overall I would say this is the top game of 2004 so far. There are a lot of great games this year, but this one is just about perfect.

Elsőre egy "gyengécske" kilences. A társaságot megosztotta.De ebben komoly szerepet játszott a szabálymagyarázat elég halvány minősége is. Természetesen én követtem el ezt. Magam részéről azt mondhatom, hogy bizony ez egy komoly játék, komoly gondolkodást igénylő. Stratégiai játéknak kevésbé nevezném, a sorozatos keresztbe rakás miatt ettől egy kissé kaotikus és tervezhetetlen is. Inkább taktikai jellegű. DE nagyon élveztem és többet nem is várok el egy játéktól. Sajnos másnak ennyire nem jött be. No azért egyet kettőt még lenyomok a torkukon.:)

RATING: 4
This game reeks of Euro. Think of every Euro mechanic (except auctions) and put it into a game -- area majority, secret (and public) role selection, pick-up-and-deliver (sort of) -- and couple that with a very unconvincing theme. The board does not evoke anything Indian; the network of cities and roads so symmetrical, I don't think this map could exist anywhere on earth.

Despite the complexity of the rule set that suggests a strategically rich game, it's too tactical for my tastes. Simply, you have to be able to build a palace on every turn. Because these palaces are so expensive, this dramatically reduces the extent of long term planning. The main source of revenue -- area-majority competition of one particular city on the board -- too narrowly focuses players' attentions, further reducing the importance of strategic planning.

Good points:

* Despite the unevocative art work, the game components themselves are of impressive quality; the board is quite huge, and the cardboard coins are thick. The selection wheels are a bit small, though.

* I give credit to the designer for adding so many chaotic events to the game (such as freely taking any player's special power) and still have a functioning design

* I appreciate any game that involves moving a pawn across the board; so many Euros do not have any kind of movement whatsoever.

RATING: 6.5
This game can be fun or it can be very frustrating, depending on whether you use a strategy that depends on other players making what you consider their most sensible move (and then they don't), or a strategy that doesn't depend on what they do.  In other words, the "builder" role is extremely risky (especially after completely wimping it out in a rule clarification) and can ruin the whole game for you, depending on who you play with.  Guess I'll have to try something else the next time I play it.

RATING: 7
Yes, it has problems. The end game is a little strange as the majority of players will all build their seventh palace in the last turn - often the winner will be the player that scores 12 in the final city. The yogi character makes the game rather chaotic too and with the wrong crowd a game can take far too long. But it had large elements of my all-time favourite game El Grande and it clicked with me from the first game. I like the action wheel, the influence scoring and the tactical play. Major problem is that it got old quickly.

Played again three years after my last play. Enjoyed it, but not sure I'd rush to play it again this year. End game still a bit anti-climactic.

This was much more of a brain burner than I expected. There's so much going on in Maharaja that planning ahead can be really tough. It can be quite confrontational with players constantly stealing roles from one another and sneaking into cities for a last minute house or palace build.

It's easy to underestimate just how powerful certain actions or roles can be. You may think some roles aren't worth stealing, but letting players hold on to them all game can really add up. Don't turn your back on anyone in this game.

Overall, very challenging and fun. I may need a few more plays before I'm 100% decided on this game.

RATING: 8
Reminiscent of Kramer and Ulrich's El Grande, which is a very good thing! Maharaja is more "scripted" than El Grande. It therefore offers fewer opportunities for brilliant play, but may be more accessible to newbies. Gamers who hate chaos and unpredictability may be turned off by the many opportunities available for derailing an opponent's plans. But we love it, and find it a very satisfying game for any level of experience. Better with more players.

RATING: 8
Excellent mix of elements from past Kramer/Kiesling games, with a decidedly fresh taste. Subtle tactics, agonizing decisions, and goes well with two players! One of the best "heavily tactical" German games I've ever played. Also, with a set number of turns and simultaneous action selection, it doesn't take forever -- provided players don't go overboard with planning.

Atendendo ao ranking e às excelentes reviews que este jogo foi coleccionando, esperava muito mais, tanto em jogo, como em encanto, pois não se pode dizer que seja bonito, nem tão pouco se que seja fácil de entrar nele. Marajá é um jogo onde o tema não se sente e demora demasiado para o prazer que proporciona. Não tem sorte à mistura, mas fica um pouco a ideia de que não temos o controlo do nosso próprio jogo, e isso é mau… Voltarei a jogá-lo, mas dificilmente o irei recomendar!

RATING: 6
Nice components and some clever mechanics are undermined by terribly anti-climatic endgame. The tension ratchets up as players buy their fourth and fifth palaces. Then someone will notice Don is going to win in two turns and there's nothing anyone can do about it. Disappointing after the buildup.

RATING: 6
Each turn of the game the Maharaja visits one of the cities of his Empire. The player who has built the most palaces/buildings in that city gains the most money (and other players get correspondingly less).
However, this is not an area control game. Players win by being the first to build seven palaces, and the purpose of getting your buildings into the right city (and making sure that the Maharaja visits the right cities) is to get enough money to build those palaces.
There are a lot of interesting things here - simultaneous action selection, special roles, travel costs, that make the game quite challenging. This is a genuinely interesting game but I could see how players could find it very frustrating and it is easy to be knocked out of contention.

RATING: 7.1
(+) Dynamic: the board changes constantly with a lot of opportunities for players to pull off some really interesting moves

(+) Well designed gaming mechanics, quite an original game also

(+) Easy rule set: rules are easy to explain and understand

(+) Plays in about 120 minutes and works well with 5 players


(-) Due to the dynamic nature of the game, there can be a certain amount of (player induced) 'chaos'

(-) The end game condition of building 7 palaces often results in multiple players getting to build their palace with victory being determined by the secondary victory condition of having the most money. This system works and leads to tense end game situations, but still it's a very 'small' race to ride: only 7 palaces... I'm not really sure about this end game condition...

(-) To me, it seems an early leader is hard to catch in with: dominance leads to wealth which allows more opportunities. In such a 'race game' this might create some minor imbalances.

(-) Prone to some (acceptable) downtime

RATING: 7
meaty, psychological, resource management game.  the game stands out in two aspects:  1.  the logistical decisions are fabulous, as you take your available pool of moves and work them into the available network of roads.  2.  the double-think aspect is also fabulous, as you take into account the resources you have availble, the resources other people have, and what resources you will eventually have.  although you can guess what you want to do as you secretly dial your two actions for a turn, you can't know for certain how you will be using those actions when you finally get to use them.  it reminds me of el grande's system of bidding for turn order.  in the 1st part of your turn, you're forced to make a decision about something very enigmatic and uncertain, and your plans are more concretely realized in the 2nd part of your turn.  on the minus side, there is some downtime, though not as severe as in many other games.  Also, the rules are quite complicated!  As much as I enjoy the game, it's not so much fun trying to remember all the rules each time before playing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Thoughts after a first playing: intensive, very calculating, but surprisingly non-interactive compared to, say, El Grande or Taj Mahal. There's not that much blocking of other people available, and there is plenty of interference you can run, and there is the blocking, and there is the role-swapping.

I guess what I mean to say is, it is plenty interactive, but not nearly as much as its mechanisms might suggest. 

Maybe I need to play more.

This is a game that really rewards planning ahead- but not too far ahead. Maharaja requires you to manage resources, area majority in the cities and route building with the added bonus of manipulating the order of scoring. There is plenty to keep track of initially, but after you see how things work the game is relatively easy to understand. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Moves are rarely obvious and often constrained by having to choose between equally desirable options.  This nicely provides each move with some tension.  Rules seem complex at first, but gameplay is very obvious once the game is actually played.  Another positive is that the game does play in the stated 90 minute time frame so offers (in my mind) the right balance of option, game tension, and decision to make for a very satisfying experience.

There is a surprising amount of pacing tension for a game that looks like it would snowball.  Deciding to invest in upcoming scoring vs. get second place now is an interesting choice.

A solid game that scratches all sorts of itches: resource management, programmed  actions, role selection, area majority.  All it needs is panzers and 6.5 komi and you'd have the perfect game.

It's fairly tactical with any number of players. Excellent board and bits too. Sadly it's not very newbie-friendly, so you really need a regular group of enthusiasts to get the most out of it.

The monk character as written has a kingmaker problem in the 3-5 player game, which we address by making the monk take the cheapest route.

An unexpected hit with my non-gamer girlfriend, due (she says) to the huge variety of actions to try out.

Update: now she hates it, which you may take as a seal of quality. (Other games so hated include go and shogi).

Slow players and the resulting downtime can make this very boring to play. Like Tikal and Java it helps things tremendously if a brisk pace is kept by all players. Unlike those games Raja needs more than three players to get the best out of it. Therefore there's a bit of a problem. Aside from that there's a neat mesh of mechanisms - I'm particularly a fan of changing the region voting order. Planning exactly what you'll be doing each turn is somewhat chaotic due to other players' actions affecting your best laid plans, but therein lies just one of many decisions you have to make as you choose an action to protect your position, try to push ahead, or try to hinder the plans of others - or all the above in one. There's scope for some very clever plays throughout the game and I think this one will reward gamers who like to give their brains a good testing. I wasn't very impressed with the addition of the Yogi to the play of the game. It seemed to be taken by each player and used immediately to give them flexibility with their third action. I prefer without. The two player rules seem unnecessarily complicated. I prefer simply two character cards per player and it plays well this way. The game is extremely similar to El Grande with simultaneous choice of actions through the wheel instead of consecutive choice through cards. Not as good as El Grande though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A very Eurish Kramer-Kiesling game, this time with simultaneous action selection and double thinking.  It is a convulated race with majorities in the middle.  If players survive the first turns and are able to catch the wave to the final spring for the win it could be a very tense and fun experience; otherwise the game become boring, long and tedious.  So, it is a double edge sword that can bring you to a wonderful or awful place, depending on your departure.  Ugly art.

Intresting game.
Every round there is a scoring, but you can, in the same round, change the city where the scoring takes place. Things get really interesting when more than one player has chosen for the action to change the scoring order.

Maharaja: Palace Building in India -- Upon first playing Maharaja, my immediate impression was that this was a pastiche of game mechanics from other games. As the game progressed, it became evident that the interplay of mechanics [b][i]works[/i][/b]. I respect the accomplishment, and I enjoy the play.  I only wish I had more palaces from Taj Mahal to use in Maharaja.

It's worth mentioning that I got a similar "pastiche" impression from Goa, but in the case of Goa, the mechanics not only work, they blend so well that I find the play more immersive than in Maharaja.  I have a feeling that my lack of immersion in Maharaja is partly due to my own inability to grasp the interplay of mechanics.  I suspect that when I do "get it", my enjoyment of the game will exceed my respect  for it.

Juego de mayorias muy divertido. Me gusta mucho la eleccion de aciones con el reloj, pensando que irán hacer los demas jugadores.
Lo peor del juego, el diseño del tablero (de los mas feos que he visto) y el plástico que está dentro de la caja, que no está diseñado para este juego, y la acabarás tirando.

Edito: Le bajo la nota de un 8 a un 7.5, por que no sale a mesa.

I was quite enthused when I first played this game, but since it's made it to the table very rarely. It's a fine tactical game in many ways, but it's also one of the least of the tactical K&K designs. There just doesn't seem to be enough variability in strategy, nor even that much difference in tactics. You have a few meaningful choices. In addition, the endgame always strikes me as odd, with multiple players usually meeting the endgame condition on the same turn, and ties being broken by a few gold worth of efficiency. In manyw ays it's a clever game, but too logistical for my personal taste.

1 play. A bit bewildering for the first half of the learning game. Still fuzzy by the end but getting a grasp on what's happening. There's just a ton of options and I'd imagine a ton of different tactical strategies that players can pursue. I really enjoyed my learning game.

Beautiful components.

RATING: 6.75
A Kramer game that seems to have gone under the radar. The game see players plaing young Rajas who send their architects around the board to be first to build 7 palaces.

The game is driven by a plehora of options; characters have special powers and each turn, players select 2 of 9 actions to execute. These include building, role change and other options. 

At heart, this is an economic game; players who best execute their precious actions are able to generate the most amount of money...which in turn allows them to build the palaces for victory.

It's a fairly intense game where the wealth of options can be overwhelming. It's meaty but somehow, seems a little unpolished at the edges (the Maharaja track is clumsy, the action disc is too small, the tracks across the board allows for players to lock into 'good' paths).

Not a bad game.

My rating for Maharaja increased once I played it with the max capacity.  This game, much like Princes of Florence, is much tighter and more difficult (read: fun!) when playing with 4 or 5 people. I enjoy the intricacies in the decision making process when there are too many things you have to do, but not enough actions in your turn.  AHHH!  Choosing your actions is FAR TOO complex with 2 choices and costly when you choose poorly.  That's a good thing!  Easy to learn but difficult to master.

RATING: 8.5
A very fine brain-burner with a major too much to do, too few actions type.  Juggling your resources but not forgetting you need to build palaces to win (which are the most expensive of course).  It is all about doing everything as efficiently as possible and being able to move around between cities easily/cheaply, building that all important central palace and watching you don't run out of money on the way is a difficult balance.  It exercises the part of my brain I liked worked out in a good heavy game and I want to play it again as soon as possible.

First game I played I took token 1 and got off to a flying start, taking first place in the first and 3rd city and 2nd in the second. together with the income from my limited road netowrk I was able to build a palace virtually every turn and ended up winning by a large margin (I think the next place person still had 2 palaces to build). If we played again I would not have such an easy time, but It did seem like that it was very hard to stop me once I had got up momentum (and a coin stash) at the start of the game - I was the only person to get income in every city the Maharaja visited.

Többségi, igazi taktikai játék. 7 várost jár körbe a Maharadzsa, aki ezekben kiértékelést vált ki. Aki ezekben paloták és házak segítségével többséget ér el az kapja a legtöbb bevételt, a többiek építéseik szerint sorrendben kevesebbet. 2 játékossal talán egyértelmű stratégia a minél hamarabbi palotaépítés, ami viszont magával vonja, hogy a másik játékosnak is muszáj erre játszania, különben esélytelen. Ez a dolog, hogy aki hamarabb leépíti a kezdeti palotáit nyeri a játékot kicsit furcsának találtam. Tetszett a körönként két akció kiválasztása, az utakért való fizetés. Mindenképp szükséges több játékossal is kipróbálni, így még nőhet a pontszám. Talán abból a szempontból nem jókor került elém a játék, hogy már ezeket a mechanizmusokat mindet láttam más játékokban, bár mivel ez a játék korai, sokan talán ebből merítettek.

[2014-01-11]
4 játékossal játszva is a fentebbi taktikát alkalmazó nyert, igaz nem éreztem azért annyira erősnek most ezt. A játék továbbra is jó, de valahogy nem az az érzése az embernek utána, hogy gyakran elővenné. A pontszám marad.

[2018-01-28]
Harmadik partira 5-en sikerült játszani. Talán a 4 játékos az ideális, még ha az öt fős tűnik is elsőre annak, mert 5-en már nagyobb az esélye a királycsinálásnak az úthasználatok miatt. A már nyerni nem tudó játékos azzal döntheti el az első hely sorsát, hogy kinek az útját használja a játék vége előtt. Viszont az eddig túl egyértelmű stratégia öten simán borult. Volt, hogy kihagytam simán egy területet, ahova nem is építettem palotát. Jónak bizonyult a házépítéses stratégia is. Most a külső utak feletti kontrollt éreztem erősnek. A játék szép, a játék jó, kicsit talán hosszabb, mint kellene. 4-en a játékidő is ideálisabb lehet.

I couldn't decide whether I liked or disliked this game as I was playing it.  Overall I think that it is a brilliant design, but I feel that it has a couple major problems.  First, is who this can be played with.  This is too much of a gamers game for most people, and conversely can easily create analysis paralysis for hard core gamers and yet be so random that it frustrates the players that need control.  Basically, it boils down to being a great game for "Gut Players".  So how often is this ever going to get played.

The mechanics, while mindbogglingly innovative, are ... well ... mindboggling.  If you over think this it burns the brain, but it just isn't worth overthinking because everything changes by the end of the round, so there is a push your luck element to the game where you must decide between safe choices and big money makers.  Tons of screwage to be had.

Plus there may be the same problem that Alhambra has which is a rich get richer issue.  Once you get on a roll moneywise, it is hard to blow your lead. (Take it from me I usually blow my lead 2/3rds of the way through a game).

UPDATE: Between the Chaos and runaway leader problem I have no more desire to play this.  Rating dropped to a 4.

Many attractive elements (not least the aesthetics), but there can be a serious runaway leader problem, with the initial Mogul almost bound to win against inexperienced players.

I never want to play this again. Although I'm sure there's a viable strategy in there (afterall, the winner of the only game I played seemed to easily kick our collective butts), it seemed like 2  hours of chaos, catch up, and doomed plans. Every time I thought I came up with a good move, the "character track" (don't remember the name) was changed or someone exchanged roles, etc. No fun.

I don't always cotton to the action point games, but this one I enjoyed.  Having the actions revealed simultaneously sped things up, I guess, as there was one thinking period per game turn rather than one per playing turn.  I found the range of actions well judged, too.

RATING: 7.8
Interesting game and underappreciated in our group.  With only two actions available to you, there is plenty of tension and interesting decisions and I do love the simultaneous action selection with the disks.  I like the area control element in the cities and the variable order that scoring is done.  The base game is a bit long, but I think that the shorter variant version would be the sweet spot for this one.  Overall, it's important to keep in mind that it's a race game, and that it's just about building seven palaces, not getting influence everywhere, and I think the race element brings it down a little bit.  Still, this is probably one of the finest race games out there.

Best with 4 > 5 > 3. Not 2. [Area Control, Planning, Blind Actions, Special Powers] The game seemed very chaotic. I could see its rating go up once you learn to manage the chaos.

I like the game. It has clever mechanics, such as the change of the scoring order, beautiful components, and decent time and flow of play. I'm only waiting to play it a couple of times more to rate it better. I think it could be a solid 8.

edit: rated 8

The resources that we have to manage are very tight and most of the times there could be more that one winner in the last move of the game.

One of the best games I've played (repeated) this year (2007)

I tend to favour the more "AT"-style games, however this is a "Euro"-style game that has plenty of movement rather than just being static, a fair bit of interaction between players rather than just being a "multi-player solitaire" exercise, and it has some fun mechanics such as simultaneous action selection that keep it tense and interesting.  Unfortunately, like many Euros, the theme itself is pretty dry, however the board and the bits are visually appealing enough to counteract this issue.  And my favourable impression of this game has nothing to do with the fact that I won it the first time I ever played it (although it came down to a money tie-breaker, the closeness of which is itself testament to the good design of the game).

RATING: 7
Liked it enough to probably buy it after one play.  Trying to guess what 4 other people are gonna do is sort of chaotic, but it makes for interesting decisions.  Players all decide how their turns will go at the same time, so it seemed like there was less waiting around for your turn than normal with this kind of game.  As a result, I was constantly entertained.  Can't wait to play this one some more.

Update Feb 2016:  Been a long time since I played this game.  I enjoyed this play a lot, but I'm seeing some potential issues in the design.  An early lead is huge, and I think there might be a solid first player advantage because of this.  The way that money gets you palaces which gets you more money if you can be the first to get into a place is pretty snowball-y.  This creates another problem in that there will almost certainly be a few players out of the race at the end, and their actions will be either boring or chaotic.  I still enjoy the core of the game, but I'm not sure this will hit the table too often.

[Phalanx 'RAJA' 2004 Edition] {City building, economic, India; blind-action selection, role-selection, variable-player-order, connection, area-majority; optimal 3-4p} {basic 7, advanced version I 7.5, advanced version II 6.5} RAJA is a decent tactical game with quite strong theme. It has plenty of player interactions and funs. The decisions are agonizing because the actions are limited each turn and players have to consider many things in choosing the actions. Since resources (gold and houses) are limited in RAJA, players must plan their actions carefully. However, RAJA is a little bit chaotic in planning actions - role cards, blind-action selection and some "swap" actions. Nevertheless, experienced players can handle the chaos and plan their actions.

The rules are not clear enough for some situations. Read through the FAQ before playing. Nevertheless, the game system is well balanced. No role cards are over-powered and the players cannot be strong in many things together - they must sacrifice some other things in strengthening the other.

The winning criteria are odd. The game will be much better if it had multiple paths of winning. Now, it just works like a racing game. All players are just racing to build all 7 palaces.

RATING: 8
Great game. Very tactical--just the way I like it. Plenty of movement and tough decisions. When players stop playing "follow the Maharaja", that's when this game really shines.

I've downgraded my rating a bit. The main reason is the "rich get richer" phenomenon that it seems to suffer from. It's hard to catch the leader once they get rolling. Still a fantastic game that I'm always willing to play.

Interesting game, though not very much so with two. It's a race to build your palaces first, which costs a lot of money, and the secret action selection mechanic coupled with the changing order of play keeps things exciting. Chosen actions are rarely unusable even if the unexpected things happen.

An incredibly deep and fun game, with painfully hard decisions to make.  Definitely one of the best game I ever played, but with just enough flaws to prevent it from the 9 scores.  The most important is a cruel lack of catch-up mechanism, the high potential of paralysis analysis (I advise to use a timer), and the possibility of getting completely screwed of a turn by a simple mistake or simple opponent's moves. 
But don't get me wrong with those negative points, overall, Maharaja is a great game, and can't wait to play it again.

A little bit chaotic with the action picking while not knowing what anyone else has.  Seems you have to be versatile in your picks, and be able to accomplish missions while still coping with unexpected changes in character or scoring order.

It was fun though, I'd like to give it a few more plays.

Judgement is still out on this one.  The first game felt very much like there wasn't much you could control.  Getting the money meant you got the win.  Afterwards we discussed it though and it may be more a matter of planning WHEN to invest in a city rather than just going for it on the first try.

A like the gems. There`re not so many games with such components.

I love the easy rules, that gives a suprising deep game play. You should plan for the future. It`s not only important to score this round, but also prepare to the next rounds.

I like that during the game you grt money, but at the end of the game it is only a tiebreaker. You have to build palaces, that`s the goal, but you need money to archive this goal.

I really like the action selection and maneuvering for scoring, but the game can feel anticlimactic if someone has a lead. I would love it if Herr Kramer would take these elements and put them in a point scoring rather than racing game, or a combination of the two.

Played this years back with David Fuga and others when it first came out. Found it a very heavy game. Played it recently again at the game club and found it very refreshing. One word to describe it: Treacherous. One small mistake can cost you the game, deny you income and stall your engine. There is a mix of strategic play but you mostly try to plan counter-measures if someone screws you over. Love the way that although the Actions stay the same throughout the game, the game gets tenser and tenser as each decision you make becomes harder and harder. Great game!

Played a couple of times now.  The trick to winning seems to be to capture the edges, allowing quick movement around the board.  This game suffers from a catch the leader problem -- you need money to get places and do things, but you can only get money by winning cities.  So the more cities you win, the more resources you have to win more cities.  An okay game to play on occasion, but nothing special here.

07 APR 2009 - Played @ GameStorm 11 - Very different mechanics than I've seen before. It's still resource management, but used in different ways. The true end goal cannot be forgotten as it isn't VPs but simply building all of your palaces. The ability to change roles mid-turn is great fun. Messing with the order of where the Maharaj is going to go next also lends itself to lots of tactical decision making layered over an overall strategic plan. I made one fatal mistake near the end of the game that caused me to finish second.

This game has a lot of interesting choices to be made, and given that, it's somewhat surprising to me, but it's one of my girlfriend's favorites.  I guess she gets into the theme here (unlike Goa/PoF/PR).

The game can be agonizing, only having the two actions to perform, needing three, usually.

Somewhen midway through the game I asked myself, what the hell I was doing and why I was doing it. So I began placing my arrow on the wheel randomly. I then resolved my action according to what the wheel said. I finished second of five and I don't think that's because my mates are boardgaming dumbasses. Maybe this rating isn't fair, since I only played this game once, but it was terribly uninspiring. Too bad, for I usually crave for Kramer games.

Beautiful game and I love simultaneous action selection.

Good game.  It may be a great game but I need to play it more.

Update:  Played again and it wasn't as good as I hoped.  I have still not played this enough, but I think it might not be as good as I want it to be.

Update: I ultimately got rid of this. The game is certainly clever as the tag line reads, but catching up from a mistake is hard and making a mistake is easy. It is simultaneous action selection, the game is tight and the consequences of picking the wrong thing feel a bit to dire. 

It sure is beautiful and has its wonderful moments. It's almost a shame it isn't still in my collection, but there are so many great, beautiful games at this weight. 




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 2


Overall - 1

There seems to be a little bit of a 'rich get richer' factor here. It's also apparent that once one player breaks out to take the lead it's a lot harder to catch up. Yeah, I'm loosing it badly,and struggling to wrap my brain around the secret action/turn sequence positioning. Not as good or clean as other Kramer designs using similar mechanics (ie: El Grande). I'm trying hard to not hate it, and it's just as hard as it sounds.

The one time I played this game was late at night after a long gaming session. I was thoroughly smashed by my opponent who had clearly studied the rules more than me.

Neat game.  Again, the overall strategy arc is eluding me in this game, however I have only played twice.  Deciding what the other players are going to do, seems very important in this game however.  It can save you actions and plan better.  Any game with reading players is a good game in my book.  Must get better however, because I don't have this game pegged at all yet.(in a good way)

This is definitely one of the best Kramer/Kiesling games.  While completely different from the other Kramer/Kiesling games I've tried (such as Torres, Tikal, and Australia), it's a very interesting and original game that seems very promising.  I eagerly look forward to trying it out more, with different numbers of players and with different variant rules included in the instructions.

I like a lot of the design decisions in this. While there are a ton of options, it's not overwhelming. There is a good amount of planning and lookahead but things can be manipulated in interesting ways. You can take gambles on your actions, hoping that you'll get gold from villages or whatever, or play it safe but maybe waste your actions. And it was hard to keep the victory condition in mind - with all the focus on winning majorities in cities, it was easy to forget that those don't give you points, the only "points" are palaces. All in all, I want to play again.

In my opinion there is a only one problem : basically those who start game doing fine they keep on going. But if you don't get money from opening rounds it's very hard to catch up the leader.

Great game.  Can be a little complex to make sure you can always do the things you want to, and when you can't, you pay a biggish penalty.  Some of the action selection can seem a little random, which means planning can be tricky, but that's all about spotting which actions are likely to be chosen by whom.  But, there are a lot of actions, so its not that easy.  Nice bits, nice feel.

I like this game even though it is a tad bit chaotic. Careful planning can mitigate the chaotic nature of this game, but chasing after the Maharaja is quite important to keep the cash flowing.

After one play, I found myself not liking this game as much as I felt I "ought" to.  I think I just don't like simultaneous action selection, especially when it mainly serves to make a game both chaotic and too heavy for said level of chaos.  It's the RoboRally problem all over again.

This game, from the first play, made me say "Wow, that's cool."  Production is amazing, gameplay is riveting, and the whole experience is topnotch.  Significantly better than just another area majority game, because it has several other mechanics that separate it, most notably the roles.  Maharaja would be a good game without the roles, but with them, it gets into the elite category.  This takes the roles of [gameid=478] and develops them from a light filler to a heavier game that will suit hardcore gamers.  Fresh and interesting.  Lots of familiar mechanics, interweaved to make something that is more than the sum of its parts.

For a game that presents itself as a deep game with lots of choices and ways for planning, it sure does have a lot of chaos involved.  The task-switching, the simultaneous-reveal, and the governor move make for too many opportunities to have all your carefully laid plans go to waste, so there's really no point in trying to plan for something to happen more than two turns later.  That, and the 7-palace endgame condition can make the last couple of turns feel futile.  It has good turn angst, but it seems to mislead you as to what kind of game you're getting ready to play.

RATING: 6.5
After 2 plays with 2 players, I was actually quite disappointed. I LOVE El Grande, like Tikal very much and think Java is a good game, so Kramer (&K) was a safe bet, Maharaja being Kramer's 2nd highest ranked game.
With more players it's significantly better as a game, with 5 players, however, turns take too long, IMHO.

In my opinion, the most important problem of the game is runaway leader: If you have a relatively stable income and are ahead by 1 palace you seem to have won the game already. And you get rubbed that in your face. When I play PR, I occasionally get really surprised at the final scoring...

The criticized chaos problem is not as bad with 2, but it's present even there
If you screw the other, you actually do so "by accident", it's not really possible to plan it (even less with more players...) - that's why it's painful when you're screwed yourself but can't really be angry at the other and you can't have real Schadenfreude when screwing someone else.

Very original game where players are architects in India: moving around, planning, building and scoring.  The game allows all players to select actions at the same time, but you must be ready to improvise, because other players can really wreak havoc on your plans.  An excellent tactical game.

Didn't like this nearly as much as I had hoped as it seemed way too chaotic. Rating removed as both of the games I played were using incorrect rules re the Wandering Monk. I had rated it a 6. We'll see how that changes.

first play 09/04. got whacked by three outstanding gamers. impressive game. so much you want to do, not enough actions to do it! rating based on first play. 2nd play 03/10/04, with 5 players...quite a different game with each player managing most influence in a region. with the winning player managing most or second in a lot of regions plus building lotsa houses!..i think well received bar one player who was indifferent.
3rd game with 5 players was superb. came 3rd building all but 1 palace. played much better but could do better..This is either a game you love or loathe. I think the game has received a number of unfair low ratings, largely due to player inexperience as to what is the most appropriate actions to chose on a turn, or that there is too much game noise to predict exactly what another player may do on a turn..i don't think it's quite as chaotic as reviewers make it to be..my ratings gone up! 230105 played with 4 from work, had a blast, game ended in 2 hours...
must be about my 5th or 6th game now! still a hot fav with me!

Played several times, with 4 or 5 players. An impressive game, quite difficult to define. Lots of things to pay attention to, and it is easy to make a mistake. I would avoid it with players prone to analysis-paralysis, since the actions you can do in  your turn are unrestricted.

It took me awhile to get around to this game.  Again we find a "just enough of that secret information guessing" game that keeps the player interaction rich and varied.  (and therefore lost of strategies that don't need number crunching to select but instead need out maneuvering of your opponent).

Legitimate competition with Citadels for most simplistic role selection game? Nice! Several mechanics here I've yet to see executed effectively: outright confrontation, rich get richer, blind action. Think Mexica but scoring after every iteration of players' turns. Really hated Maharaja when I played with three but I can't fathom the game becoming anything but longer and more chaotic with more players. First and last are the positions to occupy; first follows the Maharaja's current scoring area, last builds wherever and manipulates scoring track for next round, while middles have no real competitive advantage, hence the horrendously chaotic "force a swap of character roles mid-round" mechanic. A central palace is usually sufficient for the win; 3 + 1 for the architect with tie-breaking, meaning the competition requires something like Role #3 with an outside palace and two houses. (2+2+1, actions "build palace + house" and "move house") or Role #5 with the same setup (1+2+1, actions "free house" and "build palace + house" and "character swap" to a tie-breaking role.) The shaft is worthwhile because rich-get-richer payouts thrive on oneupmanship (the earlier player invests 12 and gets less of a return) but the maneuver is blatantly broadcasted by selecting Role #3 or #5, so first player can easily drop the extra house as insurance. Houses as income generation or a taxing mechanism is a massive fail - it just never happens - because players zigzag from top-left to top-right and generally have free reign. (Houses that link back to the start serve no real purpose after turn one and are essentially free moves afterward, so the "quarry" action is a once-a-game selection, if that.) At best no runaway leader exists so everyone's cash dwindles over time and the game devolves into selecting the "governor" action to shuffle one's winning territories to the forefront because winning earlier trumps winning later as it opens the possibility to usurp another player's guaranteed win. (i.e. central palace.) Only techy action I performed my first game was after an opponent's character swap from first to last, I effectively had two turns on him so I bumped down a dominant region for me to score for the next round, then on the following turn moved away the house linking it to the board for the shutout win; of course, given blind actions I wasn't absolutely certain he would be unprepared, or that another player wouldn't sneak in beforehand so the achievement was situational and lucksacky at best, which is just about the right description for the game itself.

I'd like to see if more diverse strategies develop when this is played more.  As is, gunning for palaces and following the maharaja around the board seems pretty straight-forward.  Screwing people is tempting, but it is usually more beneficial to concentrate on #1 and maximize your own gain, thus beating out 4 players, rather than beating out one to the benefit of all others.

This is a common theme in a lot of games, but seemed pronounced in this one.

Played it and loved it. It's not that hard to grasp in comparison with many other 'euro's', and doesn't take that long, either. It could even be done within an hour. The indirect confrontation between the players (changing roles, placing houses in villages, changing the governor track) makes this game cutthroat, but not unfriendly. It does suffer a little from the runaway-leader-problem, though, but not too much to spoil the fun.

Laurel and I really liked this game when we played it two player, but when we took it to our regular Friday night games meet, it went down like a lead balloon. As I recall, at least two of the players were in bad moods that affected the game and everyone playing it. I'm not sure that we'll ever again be able to play it on Friday nights, which is a shame as it's a very good game.

6.5 after 1 play.

The memory aspect of the game may not appeal to some. More importantly, it requires higher player counts to work and may render fewer player count not fun. Artwork is quite bad, in particular the choice of colours. Game components quality is good though.

Maharaja had potential, but the horribly ambiguous rules (we had to reference the rules at least 20 times during play to clarify timing issues and accuracy of terms/actions) and odd gameplay was terribly disappointing. The action selection is clever, but the further you are from the top of the initiative order, the less likely you are to be able to perform things as planned. Where some see this as an opportunity for greater strategic planning, I found it too chaotic and irksome to be fun. Bleh. Oh, and the monk is totally broken - yeah, I said it... The "b" word...

Thin thematically. Solid game mechanics. Variable role choice, a little bit of a connection mechanic, a tiny connection sub-game, and the trademark Kramer scoring mechanic add up to a solid game that non-gamers should really wrap their arms around.

A very well crafted game, good components, clear rules, etc. Slightly suspect to analysis paralysis, because when you have to plan your two actions in advance there are so many variables to consider. I would recommend to play with the first set advanced rules from the beginning (except perhaps for the bidding part at the game's start up). The second set of advanced rules seems to be geared more towards spicing up the two player game.

I have to say I really didn't care for Maharaja at all.  Maybe it was due to the people I was playing with not fully understanding the flow of the game, but I felt it was too easy and very procedural.  As long as it was cost effective to move to the city that was going to score, it pretty much behooved you to be there, even if it meant receiving the last place earning.  Then there's the problem of not being able to affect the leader much, unless multiple people worked together to try to shut him/her out.  Yet this isn't a negotiation game, and with the hidden simultaneous action selection mechanic, you can't exactly plan to screw a specific player without explicit table talk.

Don't get me wrong, this isn't to say that Maharaja doesn't have interesting designs.  However, there are far better area majority titles with a more streamlined rule set and challenging gameplay I'd rather be playing.

Rating based on one playing (friend's copy): I like Maharaja quite a bit after playing it once.  Lots of opportunity to plan ahead, as well as screw your fellow players.  I like that type of interaction; the variety of what you can do on your turn increases the game's replayability.  I'm looking forward to my next play.

A brilliantly agonizing K/K game.  Mistakes feel way more torturous than in most games I've played.  Yet despite my first three turns of my first game being almost exclusively mistakes, I nearly needed a tie-breaker with first place.  (I was second :^)  I noticed similar disasters and recoveries, though of far smaller scale, from my opponents; so, this seems to be a very trickily balanced game.
This game thrills me every time I play it.  Superb!

After 1 Play: I've only played with three, and think this might be better with alarger group.  Lots of stuff going on, and good opportunities to screw with your opponents plans.

After 2+ Plays: I've played many other games since I first tried this, and in comparison Maharaja has suffered.  Now it seems a pretty dull mishmash of mechanics.

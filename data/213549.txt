Too many suspect 10's boosting this rating.  Game is probably a 6.5-7.0 if you take out AW company 10 ratings.

like it more than bluff becouse of the player elimination.aslo the added set collection ads a little bit of flavor.

definitely a keeper.

This game takes Liar's Dice and adds some set collection aspects, special power cards, and takes away the player elimination. You play 9 rounds and after someone has been called out on their dice, everyone has to bet who they think is right, with the winners picking from the loot cards, and the losers losing their bet. 

It's an interesting game, but the first play left me wondering if it should stay in the collection. While there is no true player elimination, if you lose a majority of the first few rounds you can be virtually eliminated while still needing to wait out the rest of the game. Also the amount of accounting work needed at the end to total your score kind of deflates any high climax brought by the big reveal of final scores.


The game is a little long for how simple it is, and some of the secret artifact cards are clearly better than others. I probably still prefer liar's dice over this but I would play it again.

Awesome game! Combines pirate/liars dice with treasure acquisition and auctioning.  Guess the dice... mislead your opponents and claim the biggest Viking treasure horde! (I may be biased toward Viking themed games????)

Good game for a group, engages each person each round in decision making and interaction, not complicated, big colorful cards.  Very well executed game.  Can play more players with extra pieces.

Spoils of War fixes Liar’s Dice and is great for when you want this type of game with slightly more crunch than Skull & Roses.

A clever mix of Liar's Dice and set collection with card powers that manages to keep everyone very involved throughout. I like how all players must commit to a side when a bluff is called. I'm very much looking forward to the release.

Really fun game.  Loses a rating point for only playing up to 5 players.  Would've been really easy to add components for a sixth player and the game needs the ability to play at higher player counts.

Had a fantastic experience with this at Origins 2017. So good that we picked up a copy with some promos right there at the con. It's essentially a reworking of Liar's Dice, but that's a compliment. There is something oddly but deeply satisfying about 5 people shaking dice in cups at the same time. This is a great game to be enjoyed with righteous brews.

A take on Liars dice. Is more fun, due to no player elimination, and point goals; however, it takes longer too.

Liars Dice + Betting + Loot Sharing.
Seems simple enough, and it is.

The increasing strength in the game rounds makes it possible to catch up if you're willing to take a risk.

Love the games from this publisher! Fun, active group/party games. Many, many hours of friendly cut-throat competitions!

Definitely challenging in considering how much to bid and who to bet on. Can cause run away leader if you guess wrong, which is unfortunately.Close to Liar's Dice, but adds some other mechanics which is cool.

RATING: 6.5
An easy bluffing style liar's dice variant with set collection. I don't enjoy liar's dice greatly as a mechanic, because bluffing is more fun to me when your 'bluff' itself isn't a calculated gamble. Set collection scoring and non-renewable currency are good ideas that flesh out the game in a good way. Artifacts are add another wrinkle, but it is essentially chaos on top of randomness, which is take-it or leave-it for me. Good gateway game.

I was excited for a deeper Liar's Dice, but I think maybe there's a reason why LD is so simple. Extra steps and variable victory point conditions really extend and over complicate the process. I like the theme and I have a soft spot for set collection, but I was just ready for it to be over long before it was done.

Manages to take Liar's Dice and actually do something different with the mechanics. I think I still prefer Liar's Dice to this game, as this game has a lot more setup and bits to fiddle with, but I still quite liked this one.

Liar's Dice is a classic. It's easy for nongamers to play, and it plays quickly. Spoils of War is Liar's Dice with no dice elimination, no player elimination, and a set collection component. It's a little long for what it is, but I'm not sure why I'd play Liar's Dice over this--except maybe in very specific circumstances. Lots of laughs, and the betting mechanism is clever. Some of the artifacts are clearly better than others, and there's a fair bit of chaos and randomness, but I still found it to be fun.

Nice incorporation of Liar's Dice mechanic. It has its own unique feeling. Possibly you can play that 1 is a wild dice (like in Liar's dice) as a variant.

Excellent variant of liar's dice with a bidding twist. Not sure how replayable it is in the long term but I'll easily play it enough to get my money's worth - the first few plays were excellent.

RATING: 9
The larger the group, the more fun this game becomes. As a three-player game it can get pretty stuck in a routine. Overall, love the abilities certain cards bring and the set collecting bonuses. The bluffing and dice bidding is fun with the right group, but with expert gamers playing the process can also take a long time (overthinking) - which isn't a bad thing. Can't wait to play this again and gain.

There's too much in here. The set collection was boring, the artifact are random or near useless. The bidding is interesting and it's nice that there is no player elimination but I'd still rather play Perudo. Also without 1s being wilds and the exactly that many rule, it's way worse.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Takes Liar's Dice, gets rid of the stupid wild, and modifies the rules a bit to make it a much more interesting game. Then it adds on a whole new layer with the betting and cards that really makes this game interesting.

RATING: 8
After two plays (with two sets combined; six players and seven players), I think this game does a lot right. It loses some of the tension of traditional Liar's Dice, as there is no dice removal or player elimination. But the bidding on the declarer/challenger and having everyone involved each round is interesting, and the cards got more devious as the game goes on. The set collection aspect works well too.

It does seem like the step bidding variant might be needed to mitigate some high initial bids, but the base game still created some fun moments. Nice components, too. Overall, I found it enjoyable, especially with a willing group.

With new players, the game can take a bit longer.

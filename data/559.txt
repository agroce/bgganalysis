At first I thought it was ok, but the more I think about it afterwards the less enthused I am. Why don't I like tile-placement games? Not sure how many replays I will have yet. UPDATE: traded for Heroscape stuff. UPDATE: played a friend's copy with six. It was very chaotic but quite enjoyable... I think I prefer this game with a larger group.

RATING: 6
A relatively fast paced tile laying game. With greater player numbers you pretty much lose all control but if you do not take it too seriously, can it be good fun. 

I like how you are trying to make the most out of the tile you're given, which reminds me of Carcassonne. However, the board becomes quite busy after a few rounds, which makes it quite difficult to see all the potential or threats. Actually the messy board is rather uninviting to any witty cunning. I just did not feel a light game like Metro is worth squeezing all my brain juice out.

Just play quick and be satisfied with whatever the outcome.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a bit like a cross between Carcassonne, a mediumly-difficult jigsaw puzzle, a Mensa IQ test and one of those geometric maths games you played at school - but don't let any of that put you off!  Because, it's quick to play, a doddle to explain rule-wise and pretty light in flavour.  You can certainly play this with brightish kids from about aged 7 up, which is a big plus as is the fact that it scales well from 2-6 players - though it gets a little fussy with 6.  On one level, it can be a real brain-burner in that sometimes some of the plays can really get the spatial-awareness side of your brain working.  I wouldn't recommend taking too long over turns though, as it's best when played fairly quickly.  I can see this being played if you've only got a little time for one game, or as a starter or finisher to a more heavy night's gaming.  The patterns made can be awesome and the game has a sort of austere beauty.  On average, in a two player game, 1 play every 3 or 4 tends to be to spike your opponent rather than better your own postion. Most gamers will enjoy that, I think.  I'd recommend playing the variation where each player has a choice of two cards each time, as this speeds up the game to make it even brisker.  You can also pluck victory from the jaws of defeat right at the end. Last time I played, I was 36 points behind with one tile to play. I played it in such a way that my last connectable tile looped around over about a quarter of the board and ended up at a middle station for double points. That play was worth 50 points, so I won. I had partly planned such a play a few turns back, playing another tile to make something like it possible - but I was reliant upon a final tile draw, which luckily went my way.

RATING: 9
Full disclosure-- I'm a sucker for maze games, or anything with twisting paths. So this was right up my alley. I love that it elegantly handles from 2 to 6 players, still using all the board. The track tiles are a little on the thin side, but everything else in the oddly-shaped and -sized box is excellent.

Slightly more complex than Tsuro, Metro only requires you have your individual train stations have tracks that end at ANY other destination on the board. Some of my friends struggled with this, not initially understanding why you'd design a deliberately long and circuitous subway track to random destinations. But once that set in, it became a delight for everyone, especially when the board was over half-full and laying down track pieces was no longer as frivolous as it initially seems. The ability to really mess with other players' perfectly-planned tracks, or be surprised by an unexpectedly long (or short!) track by another player's play makes this charming and addictive. Another one-more-try game. Quick and fun.

Positives
- Great art and little wooden "train" cars
- Large board allows for a different layout of track every game
- Fantastically handles anywhere from 2 to 6 players
- Looks awesome once the game ends with all tracks played
- Starts simple and gets increasingly tense and complex at the end-- great learning curve

Negatives
- Initial gameplay concept can be abstract for new players
- Track tiles a little thin
- Box size and shape is awkward; may be hard to store with other more "standard" sized boxes

Just can't see the idea of this game being a train game. It may appeal to some that would like a cross between Carcasson and TTR. (for that matter, the theme could have been shoppers in a busy supermart getting to the cashier.....etc)

It did not appeal to my wife and much less on my 6 year old son.

RATING: 4
Bit of a mess this one. Mechanically and aesthetically. It seems to a Tsuro type of game. You are building circuitous routes on a board using tiles not dissimilar to Tsuro. But whereas Tsuro has larger tiles with routes that are easy to discern, Metro has much smaller tiles with even more twists on them that makes trying to devise any sort of plan vastly too complicated we think. Sure you can play it loose and just lay down tiles without thinking too far ahead but you aren't going to make any useful routes that way. So in order to make any real progress you have to AP yourself into a stupor trying to sort out where to put each and every tile. Not to mention that when you place a tile you might be helping not just yourself but your opponents. This one is just to AP inducing for us.

I have a soft spot for this game.  It's a simply tile laying game but you are building train tracks out and trying to make them as long as you can before your tracks end at a station.

A very good connection game that has a large 'take that!' aspect.  Despite the screwage factor, this is a game that feels cut throat without feeling like your being bled dry.  Players strive to make the longest route between stations and score 1 point for each tile segment they cross.  It is possible to cross a single tile several times and score each time.  If the connection station is in the center of the board, the score is doubled.  Plays best with 4 or more players.  [GTI Code: TGSL]

Decent game. It reminds me of Tsuro, but I like Metro better. Instead of just trying to stay alive, you have a goal to make your path, or railway, run over as many tiles as possible to accumulate the most points. Travel to the center of the board and get double the points. This is a light game that didn't wow me; but, I'd play it anytime I had an extra 20 minutes to spare. Plays up to 6.

RATING: 7
Usually, at the end of a game night, the sensible ones go home to bed and the remaining diehards settle for one fun, quick one that doesn't require too much brainpower. This comes out frequently. We tend to play it with two tiles in hand, and ignoring the directional arrows. It is also a game on top of the pick-pile when newbies or non-gamers are part of the group. And when you are looking for a great introduction game, there are few better bridges than this.

p: Personally, I think I am getting a bit bored with this though. There aren't many maze tile games I pass up on, but I have experienced the more recent outings more as pastimes, than as game ones. Not a good sign. Maybe the repetitive monotony of turn decisions has finally got the better of me, although that has taken a hell of a long time. Somehow I now can't get rid of the sense, that I am now just regurgitating one similar experience after the other.

Especially with 4 or more players there just isn't enough control between turns to give me any incentive to think long and hard about my tile placement, and although making a terrifically long route is still great when it happens, the sense that most of that was only through sheer luck rather than cleverness on my part doesn't make it feel a rewarding as it could be.

Linie 1 is actually starting to sound like the more attractive option, probably until I remember exactly why I disliked the puzzling inclusion of the racing part of that route establishing interpretation. Even Tsuro, a kind of mini-Metro, might be better for me, as at least it distills the basic Metro moves into an even more compact area. And more importantly, it gives me something NEW to think about.

It must be said that this still is one of the more accessible games for newbies and non-gamers, and it's probably because I am spoilt for choice that my enthusiasm for this game is waning fast. I have happily played it very often, and I am sure that, in time, this will be a welcome face again. Right now it has been completely drained of its ability to surprise me, and I am not a big fan of just going through the motions.

I keep finding new situations to explore, and even (still) new strategies to try out in, for instance, "Kardinal & Koenig". And a game like "Lost Cities", that has been played here literally more than a thousand times, still makes hand management dilemmas so engagingly challenging that I keep going back for more. Metro, no matter how good it is under the right circumstances, when played with anything more than 2 players, is just a potluck tile placement vehicle with little else under its bonnet. If people were not so instinctively drawn to tile puzzles and simple abstract pattern matching games (the main reason why it easily appeals even to non-gamers), we would all snap out of it sooner and realize that it might be about subways, but it has not enough depth to survive frequent reruns.

As a 2 player game it is holding up much better, probably because tile placement has regained the ability to trigger consequences you or your opponent can actually follow-up on. That basic strategic requirement, to me, is missing, the moment more players come on board.

The rating for the game reflects more the regard in which I still hold it, rather than my current desire to give it another bash any time soon. But giving it a mere 4 doesn't do it justice, especially if you know it is one of the few games in my collection that has come out am awful lot.

One playing.  An OK game---brings back memories of a certain pipe game I used to play on the computer, which rewarded you for doing loops in a similar way.  I've only played it with two people and wonder how the game does with more.  I think I'll try the "advance the train on the route" version to see if it takes care of the mazy confusion of the board.  Even so... not a keeper for me.

Just the sort of game I like - easy to explain and yet with a mass of thinking required. It is pretty much an abstract in its simplicity and rather reminiscent of Tsuro, though there is a lot more to it.

After a second play I am beginning to think it may be a little too light for my taste, but confirmed in my opinion that this is one I can pull out with non-gamers, safe in the knowledge that nobody will struggle with the rules and everyone will have a great time.

RATING: 8
Connect your cities to maximize your score. You need to have good vision to untangle the mess of tracks by the end of the game. Ideally for 2-4. Anything beyond that and it is less strategy and more luck. I played with 5 people and one guy won simply because he drew a lot of good tiles early.

Simple tile-laying game where longer routes score more points.  Occasional tension when deciding whether to help yourself or hurt your opponents.  Not great with 2p.  Okay but chaotic with 6p.

I didn't know what to expect from this game because I hadn't read anything about it before playaing - I was quite plesantly surprised. We played it once with the rule that the arrows had to face the right way, then again without the "arrows lined up" rule. A very different game, but equally fun! I like games with a puzzle-type element to them. This game has seen more play than I expected.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
An excellent game which requires lots of flexibility. Can be fun when people start playing in a "Take That" fashion and knocking each other off the board while you quietly build long connections. If you ever get tired of the directional rule the option to ignore the arrow only increases the replayability. I wouldn't want to play with more than four even though it accommodates more.

Another game that gets maligned on the 'geek, this one for its excessive "screwage" factor.  Personally, after a limited number of plays, I don't see this.  We only play with 2, so perhaps with more screwage would rear its ugly head, but so far it only happens enough to keep the game interesting.  We play without the variant rules for now, which probably helps - I feel that allowing the tiles to be rotated would not only significantly increase the chances of screwage, but also lead to a huge amount of AP.  Anyway, I like this game because the strategic possibilities do seem so limited, and because good choices are not always clear - even tactical responses are hard to figure in this one.  A nice, quick game that has been quite lively thus far.  And for $10 (the going rate on EBay, it seems) too good to pass up.

This is a light game that plays well with two players, and can be played in less than 40 minutes.  One of our games ended in a tie.  My wife was WAY behind and somehow doubled a 21 tile track.

A tile laying game that reminds me strongly of Linie 1, but I think I like Linie slightly more because it makes more sense to me to want to shuttle people efficiently and I kind of like the bizarre end game which everyone else pans that for. 

Anyway...Metro...pretty simple, draw tiles, place tiles, try to make long twisted routes for your own cars and/or screw with the opposition. Fast playing, but ultimately disposable and I find myself disliking this genre for the most part, especially games like this that lack even the piece placement interest of Carc, or the route planning of Linie 1.

Enjoyed this game. It can be played quickly or with more time to optimize your moves. Either way is fine with me. Not much room for strategy. Its a tactical tile placement game but well done. Not much control with a lot of people, downtime would also increase. Large luck element can be lessened by playing with a larger hand size but that increased the downtime as the analysis grows in a linear fashion with the hand size.

I have only played with six people, so my rating may change when I play with less. I found with this many people that the game is too much down time, as people fall into "analysis paralysis". I do like that there is ample screwage, but this is too much like a puzzle for my tastes.

Tile placement game. It was a game where nothing much really happens as it has only one mechanic - pick a tile, then place a tile (to connect train routes). While there was some player interaction based on placement, it just feels like something is missing. Nothing special.

Quite good, esp. if you like doing puzzles I would think.  Best to play fairly quickly, esp. as the last few moves tend to be somewhat perfunctory (when the final winner has pretty much been determined).  I've found that it's good to keep as many routes open for as long as possible, although if people are playing defensively then you might get in trouble with that strategy.

This game is in my collection because my girlfriend has a penchant for games with strong subject matter, and rather likes the city of Paris. (To be honest, it's not a bad place, but it's so freakingly uniform that I wouldn't want to live within the boundaries of the Périphérique Intérieur.) At first I found it boring, until I discovered we'd playing with the wrong scoring rule: points go to the colour of the completed line, not to the player completing the track. And [i]then[/i] it suddenly became an agreeable and very lightweight pastime built around the continuing dilemma: do I block others, or do I score myself? To call this game stellar is the overstatement of the century, but it is easy to learn and plays pretty fast. I do not, on any occasion, take this title seriously, but I do play it with people who are not really into boardgames, or prefer such simple games. And under those circumstances it has yet to fail me, and for that it gets a very strong rating boost. But avoid more than 4 players: things become too chaotic then.

[b]Update[/b] After playing this game again after a long pause (with the multiple tiles in hand-variant) I still agree with the above, but nevertheless I dropped the rate a notch to reflect my changed interpretation of the various values.

Simplistic, fun, euro style board game that anyone can play and have a good time doing it.  The game board is small and the game plays up to 4 players.  The rules are really short.  This is a tile laying game in which players try to build the longest subway tunnels under Paris.  Players can play offensively or defensively in their tile plays.  All in all a good solid game which plays in about an hour.  There are also a few optional rules, which are good, for replayability.

Short game that has a carcassonne feel to it : pick a tile and try to put it in the best spot. I like it less than carcasssonne because there are not so many options and the "board" isn't as nice either. Playing it on BSW using the 3 tiles rule makes it more interesting.

This was better than I was expecting from it's rating.  The tile laying element worked well enough, but in much of the game the logical options seemed limited.  You could plan ahead by leaving some empty spaces for yourself or traps for others, but there was not much strategy involved.

This game gets played a TON.  Everyone always enjoys it, and the fact that the game can be taught so quickly is a definite plus.  There are some people who get paralyzed by choices, but as long as we can keep on them to place their tiles the game moves along nicely.  Really a lot of fun to watch some of the paths develop.  I would think this is one kids could play, that would be good for them developmentally, but they may not get all of the strategy inherent in the game until they are older.

RATING: 7
This is a very fun game in the same vein as Streetcar but in my opinion much more fun. You try to connect your Metro stations to neutral stations by the longest routes possible. There are also stations in the middle of the board that count double for track length. There is a lot of opportunity to mess with the other players as you can lay a tile next to any placed tile whether it connects to one of your tracks or not. It is very simple and very busy.

As you play, the board fills with tiles of twisting interlocking tracks and it is very visually pleasing to look at while still being clear as to what is happening.

I was lucky enough to order my copy from Funagain so the rules are clear. "Points for completed routes are scored as soon as a continuous line is formed from a starting station that connects to another arbitrary station (regardless if it is one of your stations or an opponent's)."

All stations are scored as soon as they are complete. This means each one, so if two are finished at the same time then two are scored. Stations are scored for whoever they belong to regardless of who completed them. As far as in what order do you score the lines, well, since it does not impact the game in any way, so score them in any order you care to score them in.

I really like this one.  So simple, but with a lot of depth.  A real nice balance between helping yourself or screwing your opponent. But bottom line, it's a whole lot of fun, and doesn't take a long time to play. This is also a perfect intro game for non-gamers, as it is incredibly easy to teach/learn.  It's perfect for a light evening of gaming when you don't want to invest a whole lot of time.  This was sort of a lesser option during a Math Trade, but I'm now very glad I got it.  It is definitely a winner.

Donated to a Library for a Kid's Gaming Program.  A nice thing to do, but I miss this game

RATING: 4
I played this game with 6 people. The end results had more to do with luck and your position at the start of the game then with skill. Halfway through the game I wanted to commit board game suicide. It was so boring I wanted the game to end as soon as possible. This game might be fun with 2 to 3 players but with 6 it was a waste of time. It comes with 60 tiles. The first round of tile placment goes fairly fast. But the next rounds took each player a couple minute to decide where they wanted to place the tile. Take 2 minutes and multiply it times the number of tiles left in the game and it can take over an hour and a half to play. Waiting 10 minutes in between turns doesn't add up to a fun game

This is not a particularly deep game but as a light tile laying game it really hits the mark for me. It is not a particularly friendly game, but I rather like that aspect of it. I prefer to play it with three tiles in my hand so that I can plan a little more - but it still works quite well with the standard rules. I have played it mostly with 2 players for which it works particularly well. I am interested to see how it goes with more players.

RATING: 6
The remake of Iron Horse, and the only changes are in the production values. Essentially a maze game set in the Paris Metro rail system. You have to place tiles onto a gridded board with the object of making your lines as long and as complex as possible, while terminating the lines of the other players as quickly as possible. You score points for your lines based on the number of tiles your line enters, double if you terminate it in the centre of the board. Fun, light game. This edition looks fabulous.

Okish game. Could be used when you are introducing friends to boardgames. Or with family. It is similar to carcassone - you are laying railroad tiles, and try to outsmart other players, by having long route, while they have short routes.

It's a fun, pleasant and servicable game.  There isn't actually too much game there as far as I can see unless you really want to analyze every other players position.  I normally play this with 5 or 6 other players and so to think that much while playing isn't worthwhile.

Thus for me it's more of a pleasant "help myself or screw someone else" exercise.  You sit back and chit chat while laying down the tiles and it all moves along speedily.  If it was pulled out all the time I'd be dying, but as one among many filler alternatives it does it's job in a relaxing way.

First things first, visually, this game doesn't work. Your eyes start swimming tracing tracks. Even if that doesn't turn you off, this game is degenerates into random "take that" - let's put a u turn track at this fella's starting station! The game has some good ideas but fails badly in execution. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
[3 plays] This is a beautiful game, steeped in the old Art Nouveau look of the Paris metro.  Kinda like Age of Steam, it has the deliberate-inefficiency element; you want your metro lines to be as long and loopy as possible, not to go right from point A to point B.  But you'll be lucky if they go anywhere at all, because your opponents will be trying to smite you by bringing your lines to a swift, disadvantageous conclusion.  It's a little bit Carcassonne-like in that (a) there's tile-laying, and (b) you can do it to benefit yourself or smite others or both.

Played 10+ times. Very nice game by Dirk Henn. Much like Showmanager, this game gives you the illusion of control by presenting a player with many possibilities, but requiring good tile/card draws to do well. But somehow his game keep a nice quick balance with a lot of tension. Metro is light and fun, but can burn the brains of people who can't "see" the twisted spaghetti-like rail routes developing on the board. Faster and less strategic than Streetcar, and a little less finicky and punishing. Better family game than Streetcar. Nice graphics to boot.

Nice board & components.  More strategy than one might first think.  No cards--just tiles that are drawn & laid.  Player with the longest tracks ending in the best location, wins.

Wouldn't mind playing again but overall it seems like it would be much better suited to a computer where you could trace routes more easily.  As it is at least initially it would be difficult to play without getting a little bogged down tracing routes.  Hard to say how easy it is to control.

An ok game - leaning towards abstract which I dont mind.  Issue here of being intentionally or unintentionally screwed without any recourse.  Also, a bit AP for some players.  But, I think Stevie would like this a lot (train tracks) (1/4/12). UPDATE:  Provided you use the correct german interpretation of tile placement rule #3 "A tile may not be placed such that a metroline from one numbered station to another traverses only one tile. Sole exception: the tile cannot be placed anywhere else." then as a next step from Tsuro for the new gamer, this is a good game, and also a nice lighter screwage game (Rating 6.715: Jan 2015).  Note: First game in a unique 3 decimal rating so I can quickly sort a top 100.

The first game I played was won by one route which scored more than any other player did. The second game I knew what I was doing and tried to create similar routes for myself, and managed to win. We eventually realised it's a game of screwage AND a game of setting yourself up, and settled down to a comfortable style of play. 

Despite its chaotic look, I think this game rewards thought. It's easy to teach and it's pretty, so I now have my own copy and have played it quite a few times.

RATING: 3
This is an alright game, lacking of any strategy as everything boils down to what tile you draw.  I wonder if the limitations on how each tile is to be played were lifted if this game would be more compelling because as is the placement feels very controlled. I had an alright time playing, and I see it's merits as a filler, but there isn't much game here.

Slightly chaotic tile-laying game where you can never be sure, how beneficial each tile actually is when laid down. Protecting your own lines and hampering those of other players is still easy enough, so the choices feel meaningful. Is very easy to teach, plays well with different number players and is reasonably quickly (30-45 minutes), which is always nice.

Second Impressions: Played 3-player game with some other gamers.  A bit more aggressive this time through. Our minds were as twisted as the tracks.  It was a lot more fun. 7/10

While not the best, nor most interesting game, it does do all right. Nothing  too special about it, aside from it being very well-suited for two-person play.
The way it plays out is strange, and the most efficient routes aren't worth many points.

However, there is a serious 'screw-you' mechanic in this game, which makes well for competitive play.

Metro is more of a roadside sobriety test than a game. It's approximately as fun as untangling a neglected rope. I'd rate it worse than a mild headache but better than a migraine.

The frustration of the tedious visual route-tracing is compounded by the players' inability to set up good plays for themselves. The game inevitably devolves into finding ways to puss your opponents' lines, since that's usually the best thing you can hope to accomplish. Not worth the effort.

Played 5+ 3 and 4 players 45 mins. Another game I am starting off at a rating of 6. I like the simple rules which only take a couple of minutes to explain. I think this might be a game that looks more fun than it actually is. With 4 players there is a pleasant amount of chaos for a casual game. I am going to try this one out on the family. *UPDATE* Played a few 3 player games with the family. Naturally everyone picks on Dad so I don't stand a chance of winning but it is a nice way to spend time together. I imagine you could play this with children as young as 5, manipulating children’s scores to subtly help them out is a pleasant challenge. I'll leave my rating at a 6 but in certain conditions it is the perfect game to play. Dec 04

Nifty tile-laying game. I like the ability to simultaneously help yourself and hurt your opponents. Usually a pretty quick game as well. Very similar to the more recent Tsuro.

I love this game.  It's light, but not entirely without strategy and tactics.  Bends closer to the luck and chaos, but by making the tiles exercises in Escher-esque ultra-serpentine noodling, it seems to mitigate overanalysis and also provide definite choices.  

Solid non-gamer pick and excellent with two players. (If you don't dig luck & randomness, then the less players the better). May also take longer to play with more (I've not played with more than two). 

Since donating it I've taken to Tsuro for a similar experience. I've also been playing the Tsuro app (one other reason why I was happy to part with Metro). 

Donated to Uncommons NYC game café.

RATING: 5.5
The main choices in Metro involve deciding whether to advance one of your own lines or block someone else's progress.  The game is basically tactical, since you only have one tile to play with each turn and thus can't really work on making long-term combos.  I think the "2 or 3 tiles in hand" variant is probably better since it would make this a strategy game.  But I'm not sure I would ever use the "allow tiles to be placed in any orientation" variant, since the arrows simplify play a lot (as long as every player remembers to pay attention to the arrows, and no erroneous plays are missed).

In general, connecting to the central stations is a good play because of the double points, and as a second resort, blocking the central stations (by connecting the station to itself while disconnecting a player who was about to reach it) is a good idea.

In my first play of this game, I noticed the similarity to Streetcar.  Although I don't remember Streetcar very well, it seemed to me that the tiles in Metro are more complicated, and can't be upgraded/replaced.  Also, unlike many tile-laying games, a tile can be scored more than once if the track is curvy enough.

I read a little about the "Cable Car" game that is basically an extension of this game to include stock... it seems like an interesting strategy game that I'd like to try.

One of those track tile-laying things where you only get one tile a turn, and you just do the best you can with it. Try to make your track the longest and twistiest, and interfere with others' tracks if you can't help yourself. For me, fairly dull, although at least it moves quickly. Playable but not exactly good. Tsuro does nearly the same thing but is shorter and prettier.

(12/27/2015) Comment based on two plays.

This is a cute, little track-tile laying game, similar in concept to [thing=559][/thing]. Players place tiles that have an assortment of track patterns, attempting to trace a continuous route for a number of their streetcars, in the longest routes possible for the most points. Tiles are drawn one at a time like in [thing=822][/thing], either playing the tile they have in hand, or drawing from the pile and playing that instead. Points are scored for length of the route, when it is terminated with tile play. Scores are doubled, if the route manages to trace into the central station.

This is a quick, fun, filler, with a good mix of luck and strategy. Easy enough for younger children to pick, yet having enough depth to intrigue adults. Rating: "7".

De az biztos, hogy csodálattal adózom a játék mechanizmusának, hogy minden kártya összekapcsolható minden kártyával és mindegy melyik színnel vagy, mindegyikkel kiegyenlített a játék, de maga a játék nem túl izgalmas, ezért is került eladásra.

After two plays I like the tile laying and the possibilities for scoring. Nevertheless it's a game with very much luck involved when playing with more than two players.

This game has a great premise and theme going for it, but ends up flat.  The routes are just too hard to keep track of unless you have a way to highlight where everything is going in your head.  Of course you can't really and so we meet our old friend AP.  Even without rotating tiles, the AP is just a tad too much and the game bottoms out, for me at least, somewhere in the 'Ok' category.  It's decent to play online though, where the computer keeps track of it all for you.

It was like a complicated Tsuro.  And I don't really need a complicated Tsuro.  I of course realize this came first, but that doesn't mean that I want to play it as much.

I mean, there are decisions to make.  But they just don't seem to kick and and be as fun as killing someone in Tsuro.

Not to mention that Metro is a pretty ugly game with chincy tiles.

Quick and entertaining tile-placement game where you're trying to maximise your train routes.  I liked that the tile-placement is totally free, it means that the players always have the choice between making a move benificial for them or one that's bad for an opponent.  I also liked that the tiles may only be placed in one orientation as this reduces thinking time and streamlines the game somewhat.  Not particularly complicated but good fun and would play again.

Decent tile laying game.  Seems like yet another game I can take or leave.  The board art is functional, but leaves a bit tobe desired.  We played with the basic rules following arrow orientation, but I think I might like it better using the variant where you can rotate the tile.

How can you place your tiles to make your track longer and/or restrict other players? Should work with all stated number of players. Simple directions. Tiles make pretty patterns. I like maying closed loops. Don't play this with a mathematician.

RATING: 5
I like this little tilelayer, quite good with 2, 3 is ok too but more would be very chaotic (almost total lack of control) with the size of board to play on. It's fun trying to maintain the balance between building your route and trying to cut off the opponents' routes

Pros: good screwage, choices, brainburning(in a good way). Cons: Luck in tiles(as usual with any tile game), lack of strategy (like Carc pretty hard to plan with one tile at a time, maybe 2 would be better?)

Another fun little occasional filler

I've played this sort of game in many forms - usually a "pipe laying" game on the computer.  I never expected the mechanic to work as a multi-player game, but it does.  It does depend a bit on luck, much like Carcassonne.  You may either play the tile in your hand or draw a new one, which usually leaves you a crappy tile in your hand for several turns until you find a home for it.  The island in the middle that doulbes the points of routes gives it an extra edge of strategy.  After several plays, it's not an incredible game, but a solid game that will see occasional play time.

I played this several times before I started logging, since there was a guy who used to bring it to Games Night (not CABS) a lot.  As I write this, I only have one logged play and that was at CABS.  My comments here are from much later.

Tile-laying game in which you're trying to connect each of your train stations to another station, using the longest possible route.  If you connect to the stations in the center, it scores double.  You play until everyone has scored all their trains and the board is full.

I wouldn't mind playing it again, but I can't say I've missed it particularly.

A puzzle-like tile laying game of 'help-or-hinder' that I bought for my younger son.  I, however, have a difficult time recognizing the convoluted connections which others may find to be a subtle and somewhat charming quality in this game.  I feel a house-rule is needed for the lack of control given the randomness in the single tile draw.  Other than that, a decent game and one that IMO is better played with fewer players.

* Kickstarter bonus with Dark Darker Darkest *

Tile-placing game in which you complete the 32 routes of the Paris underground. Points are given for each tile the train crosses on its journey from starting station to its final destination, with opportunity to double points if it reaches the centre... a not so easy task given the way the tracks lay out AND the fact that you cannot rotate the tiles (they have to be placed in a set direction, thankfully). It also makes sure the players' trains are spaced out for each number of players. There is a lot of strategy after the luck of the tile draw, and the game is quick to play… but it just never seems to draw you in completely.

PLUS: quick to learn, challenging to get big points
MINUS: once someone's on the track to big points it's very difficult to stop them, the corner launch spots are a pain to get out of

A good - and somewhat mean - tile-laying game for two players, Metro gets chaotic the more players join in. With 4 or more players it's more an exercise in kingmaking and hoping that you're targetted the least. For these instances I'd like to try the stock variant from its successor Cable Car.

Solid tile placement & network game that scales well from 2 to 6 players. The little red arrows prevent horrible bouts of analysis paralysis.

The gameplay for Metro is right up my alley.  Make your own tracks longer and the other players tracks shorter.  So I would rate the gameplay a 9.  But...

To me the theme is among the worst in gaming.  You want to make the track as long as possible???  What customer would want to ride on it?  I suppose it shouldn't get to me so bad, but it does.

A game that might work if played with a bunch of carebears. When played with a group that (rationally) as a whole tends to close off short tracks as soon as they're opened, tends to not be interesting. The way to win is to be lucky, and open a station when nobody else happens to be able to quickly loop the track back.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Simply not my kind of game.  The theme appeals (I love subways), but the game in itself is tedious for me.  It's difficult to see where my lines are going, or too difficult to waste much time in figuring out the optimum placement.  I don't even think about what my opponents are doing.  If I played this with a serious, A/P-prone player I think I would actually have to quit the game.  One nice thing - on the online version, the computer colors your line, which helps to visualize the possibilities, making it much easier.

It's strange that the only choice you have is where to put the tile. You cannot even rotate it. However even with this drawback I cannot say that the game is bad. However, sometimes it seems that you cannot do much to improve your position, because often helping you means helping other player(s) too.

A light strategy game - I am not much interested in puzzly tile laying. While I have not played it much I suspect that once you get some basic strategic tips the decisions aren't particularly difficult (maximimize my score or screw the perceived leader). It is meant to be a relaxing game where you don't have to think too much.

This connection game blows Tsuro out of the water at any player count, for what that's worth. I can imagine it's better on the computer where you can see at a glance where every line is heading (and you don't have to wait for anyone else to play), and filling in the last few tiles could produce some random swings. OK, don't play more than four or it becomes all about who doesn't get randomly offed at the beginning. I stand by the Tsuro statement though.

A nice little tactical brain-teaser for 2. We haven't played with more players yet- this looks like it would be a vastly different game with 5. I don't have a grip on strategy yet, except that I like to shoot for the double-scores with the center station rather than try my luck with longer meandering routes. My one real complaint is that it can be hard to follow the path of each train, so we are considering marking the start station # on the bottom of each of the blue and yellow cars (since we only ever play this for 2, really). The grey on black decor leaves a little to be desired.

If somebody asked me how to define "headache" with a board game, I'll immediately answer metro. First, let me state that the design itself is clever and seems to have been carefully thought, but it just makes my head hurt.

Metro offers the most painful visual experience I have seen in a board game. And it's not because of the components, which (thankfully) are boring but functional, it's because of the routes! It's almost impossible to follow each player's route and clearly see which are occupied by who. Indeed, almost all the downtime is due to the impossibility of having an idea of how the game is developing without a very detailed look.

The theme... Well... It would have been more logical that this one was about moles digging their dens, because the extremely loopy tunnels that form are impossible for an underground railway. Indeed, if a remotely similar railway existed, it would have been closed in a day or two due to frustrated passengers that didn't managed to reach their destiny, while others would have suffered injures for slipping in one of those insane loops.

Rants aside, the game itself is cleverly designed but, seriously, I just can't handle it!

Metro is a very basic "make a long  path from point-A to point-B" -game. The railpeaces looks awful, but who cares when the game itself works quite well. Nice game when played rarely, but not superb.

While you are limited to luck of the draw in tiles, its still fun trying to make long rails that eventually connect.  Plays quickly and is easily taught and learned.  I'm not a big fan of playing the basic game, but do enjoy adding in a couple variants (hold 3 tiles in your hand at all times until the end to have more choice in tile play, 2.  Tiles can be played any direction in that the arrow does NOT have to be played facing north.)  Still chaotic but decisions are more plentiful and play a larger role in the game.  With these variants, I give the game a 5; base game is only a 3 for me.

Very good, intriguing game. Developing a strategy isn't obvious, as other players can wreck your position quickly. On the other hand, the gameplay is so open that a situation can easily be rescued, if not exactly in the direction previously planned :-)

RATING: 5
This isn't a bad game, but what frustrates me is that it's not really a game of completing your subway lines so much as a game of screwing up everyone else's. There's very little point in actually trying to accomplish anything of your own, and the game seems to devolve into the winner being who got screwed over the least. Which is fine, I suppose, but not quite fitting in the theme, which seems to suggest something else. Maybe it's just the people I play with.

A bit of a disapointment. The concept seemed interesting, in a carcassonne/railwaybuilding sort of way when I bought it, but after 3 or 4 games, it doesn't really catch my interest anymore. 

I find it too defensive in playing style, which really isn't my thing.

The components are not made of first class materials, Espc. the tiles. It would have added a lot to the game, if it had Carcassonne-type tiles: good thick, durable ones.

Labyrinthine fun that is kept from being a favorite by the overly easy screwage - one of my yardsticks for a really good game is whether it's possible for a player to win even if all others conspire against him, and in Metro it's very definitely not possible.

Otherwise, I'd recommend placing tiles with their direction fixed, since free placement leads to more analysis and play duration than the game's depth merits.

Played 3 times.

I like metro. It plays fast and we often play it at lunch with 3 or 4 people. The games are usually close right until the end.  There is a tiny bit of luck in the tile draw, but nothing that ruins the game. I have yet to try the optional rule of allowing the tiles to be placed in any direction. I think that could lower the luck factor a bit, however it may also make it too easy.

Update 2: It´s down to a 5. There is no satisfaction in winning this game, and it´s not very exciting to play. Not sure I´m going to keep this..
---
Update: Played 5-10 times. Prefer it as a 2-player game. Even then, Carcassonne offers more interesting decisions with meeple placement and such. The one great idea here is the arrows. They probably reduce the playing time a lot. I rate it a 6.

---
After four sessions with 4+ players I´m beginning to think that this might be a great 2-player game. With more players you end up giving lots of points to others and receiving lots of points from others. I don´t mind spending a move giving nine points to another player to prevent him getting twelve points later, but in this game there are just too many of those moves. I don´t mind playing but it doesn´t feel very rewarding. I need to try it as 2-player some time.

Henn. 2-6, recommended with 2-6 says BGG poll.

For years this was my go to filler/gateway game.

All my friends seem to like this one better than I do. But at least this is more fun to play than Carcassone with beer and pretzels. Would rate it higher if I had something to do in between turns besides bitching at the other players for screwing up my routes.

Check the free computer version to see if you like it. It's actually pretty well made, and easier to play than the board version, but the A.I. is pretty tough. And the good thing: the computer isn't looking all over the board to see where the newest piece fits the best...

NL: Makkelijk snel legspel. 
Tegeltjes leggen om voor jou zo lang mogelijke Metro routes te maken. De routes van je tegenstanders mogen natuurlijk zo kort mogelijk...

Best veel mensen vinden 'm leuk, ik vind het hooguit wel aardig. Blijft in de collectie omdat Wolf 'm misschien leuk vindt.

Update Oct09: just played the new version (Cablecar) and remembered why I dislike the game. The new version has an improved shares variant which is actually a little better, but I still didn't like it. So I downgraded my rating for this more boring version even further.

Feels a lot like a drawn-out version of Tsuro. Can have a lot of downtime when playing with more than two, especially in the first half of the game as myriad different combinations are analyzed by each player. The 'arrow' mechanism limits this somewhat, but do have a good turn there are still a huge number of potential moves to analyze (one, sometimes several, per playing piece -- 32 total pieces at game start)

Got this from Tanga.  A fun little game.  Plays well with two, more than that gets a lot more chaotic.  Too many other players can ruin your game plan.  With two you can at least try for a strategy.  I like it though.  A reasonable challenge without a huge time commitment.

Another gratuitous tile-layer... Metro, Tsuro... Tsuro, Metro... in all fairness, this one was maybe there first, but I do think there are too many of these games, abstracts for people who don't like abstracts. My preference in most cases is for the simpler game - which in this case would be [gameid=16992] - and this is no exception. It's more than an aesthetic issue: the bigger the board, and the more complicated the paths, the more likely it is that someone (you know who you are) is going to unwittingly make a connection that throws the game to another player.

Simple as tile laying gets, with only one illegal type of tile placement. Players attempt to connect owned tracks on meandering routes for the most points.

My rating is based on my assumption that I will like this game more with fewer players. The first game was with 5, and while I enjoyed it, I don't like the lack of control over your own fate. There is too much going on that's out of your control for any real strategy to shine through. I do see this changing with fewer players (this might be one of those games that I like most with 2 players - we'll see) and anticipate the rating remaining stable or even increasing.

RATING: 4
Upgraded my rating a point upon further play.  There are some decisions to make here, but the chaos (which grows with the number of players) is still too much to warrent this game lasting more than 20-30 minutes.

Update: downgraded back to 5, and then to a 4.  There really isn't much here to work with.

Simple tile placement game.  I think I like it better with fewer players, as there isn't much to do when other players are taking their turns.  Also, this is one of those games where more players = more randomness.

Like a better version of Tsuro (no eliminations, multiple starting points). Light yet engaging, and it plays six! Only issue is that because trains always drive on the right side of the track, there are fewer possible types of tiles than Tsuro, and quite a few duplicated tiles.

Good light game.  Need to keep to a certain amount of time per player to avoid having the game take too long.  The game can be prone to analysis paralysis when using the rules for placing the tiles in any direction as opposed to the basic rules of in the direction of the arrow on the board.  Also, the game can turn ugly when only 1 person is always ending the other player's lines instead of building his own.  I'm fine with it but this could be a put off for some players.

A nice "rail or connection" game variant ... though you can get hosed by the unfortunate "luck of the draw" for your start and end points, making your travels much more difficult that some of the other players.

Lord, I'm glad I don't ride any of the trains that I end up building in this wonderfully engaging game.  The mechanics are simple and easy to introduce to new players, but the strategy can be quite deep as you look to help yourself while either not helping or actually hurting others.  This can lead to a bit of "screw you" play, but that's usually at a minimum before the end-game.  And when you add in the jokes you can make over the convoluted, naseau-inducing paths that the trains take to get from A to B, it's always a fun play.

Plus, it's reasonably short and plays well as you add more players.  Well worth playing, and always a good time.

Based on one play: A quick game of creating routes in order to have your train pass through the most tiles. Each turn you lay one tile, anywhere you want connected to a current track, if you make a train reach an exit, it follows it's track and scores points equal to the distance. You you want your trains to travel a lot and others to exit quickly. Simple and fun, with a fair amount of luck, but still amusing.

A similar game in appearance and play to Tsuro, but much more strategic, with some opportunities to improve or hose others limited by tile draw.  Not very heavy but can be prone to some bouts of AP (not like Tikal or anything, though) as people calculate their best possibilities.

Played Iron Horse and I prefer this to Carcassonne, in that your options become more limited as the game progresses coupled with the neat fixed orientation rule, so the play speeds up. (However it is more vicious than Carcassonne as not only do you play to limit an opponents score but also reduce their scoring opportunities; this highlights the plus of Carcassonne in that forcing a meeple off the board means another opportunity to score). Newbies find Metro more visually confusing than TaYu (yet more portable). Unlike Carcassonne, there is a more uniform tile distribution to memorise to tactically determine best placement. Note that the Metro ruleset doesn't mention that only one scoring marker can occupy one space (a la Torres).

RATING: 2
A very chaotic game of railway connection through tile placement. The more players, the less control. Almost no control in 5-6 player games and only a bit more with 3-4 players. I've never played it with two, but I think that's the best number of player for this game. Zero satisfaction in playing this. Most of your routes get completed by other players, often unintentionally, while you are waiting for your turn!

I guess there must be enough appeal for this game since a copycat game was introduced in 2005 named Tsuro. This one comes with interesting Asian motif and calligraphy (Chinese or Japanese?) but with only minor differences in gameplay.

It's very unlikely that I play either of these ever again.

Two two-player games. Rating is likely to go up with a little more experience. Since all trains will eventually score, work to connecting to long nets almost regardless of where they go; and aim for the center stations.

RATING: 6.25
The game is interesting.  The object is to get your train to the station to double your points.  You gain points for each square your train enters before it exits either off the board edge or the central station.  Getting to the station can be a problem.  You and your opponants take turns placing tiles with tracks.  Your opponants can exit your trains for you therefore, potentially reducing the points you could have received.  There are rules that apply to laying the track that may make laying a track illegal.  Learn the rules.

I have yet to play an actual full game of this: one 2p run through by myself, and one 2p game with a buddy while only using the 5p placements. After reading some comments on here, I would have to agree that this game can easily turn into a "screw the other player rather than better myself" type of game. I would like to see how it plays with more people, as the tiles will go out more rapidly. Will it still be as cutthroat? I also think that as a 5p or 6p game it could go quicker than other games with the same number of people.

Played in a 5 player game. Yes, it turn fairly cutthroat. Word of advice, try not to be a color that has a station in the corners. It killed me by getting only 6 pts between my 2 corners.

Neat tile laying game of trying to make indirect routes, instead of direct connections (why do a lot of "train" games reward circuitous routes?).  I played this as a two player and enjoyed it.  Sometimes you are constrained by the tile draws, but that's not such a bad thing in a shorter, lighter game.

Route building through tile placement. Feels like Alhambra with a shared board. You can't really plan ahead or formulate a deep strategy because you can only see one of your tiles ar a time (so your best move is usually quite clear). Fun light game.

RATING: 9.06
É um jogo muito simples mas que normalmente causa grandes dores de cabeça, porque chega a uma altura em que os jogadores se sentem incapazes de ultrapassar as barreiras que o desenrolar do jogo vai apresentando. Aparentemente é um jogo feio, com peças a preto e branco, num tabuleiro sem grande graça, no entanto, o Setup confere-lhe cor e quando acaba até que deixa a mesa engraçada. A 2 e a 4 o número de estações está equilibrado, a 3, 5 e 6 há jogadores prejudicados, mas mesmo assim é um bom jogo, capaz de desafiar jogadores experientes e suficientemente fácil para agradar aos novatos.

I have only played this once - it wasn't our copy, or that of anyone we game with regularly, so it's likely to be our only game.

Fast, dizzying track-laying game that, in my opinion, gets a little repetitive midgame. Near the end, when there are fewer places to put tiles, and when winning and losing hinges on a lucky draw, things get tenser and more interesting. Increasing the number of tiles one can hold lessens the luck element but increases analysis.

Works well with 2.  Works well with 6.  Not certain if I like the luck of the tile draw in the game to allow for any real strategy.  It's either help mine or hurt yours.  Game is greatly enhanced by the online implementation which colours the active lines for a bit easier route tracking.

An okay two-player game, I guess.  We've only played one time, so I suppose my rating is a bit premature.  It took us a few turns to get the hang of how the game plays and, while you can be strategic in how you lay your tiles, it feels like much more of a tactical game.  I can see how with more players, the board would get fairly chaotic and hard to carefully design your metro routes.  Anyway, a basic game that passes the time, but not one that I'm really excited to play again soon.

Very deep game with lots of strategy, deciding when to finish a player's rows off, how to hide your very long route in the sea of tiles.

I didn't like so much Trax and even more I disliked Tantrix. But this game is different. It's based on the same core game concept. I mean - game mechanics. But it has a deep theme, and... well it has 'this' something. For me a great game. Must-have from such a games :) 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's a good game, that I want to like. Seemed that the best way to win was to be nasty to everyone else! I just had trouble following the track - better colour on the tiles would help. Not being able to turn the tiles is both good (saves your brain) and bad (choices are reduced).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
A pipe-laying game where your ability to advance your own position is dwarfed by others' ability to screw you over.  Each turn boils down to deciding who you're going to wreck and then waiting for it to happen to you.  As much fun as punching each other in the head repeatedly.

Not bad - just for fun. Kingmaking problems abound. It's one of those visual games where you're trying to beat out your opponents for board position.

Combine tile laying with trains, how can it miss?  Both of these are things I like in games.  There is a lot going on here.  I enjoy it because it satisfies the spatial parts of my mind.  You can also play pretty nasty--which isn't a good thing when I'm playing with my wife.  There's not a lot of lomg-term planning you can do since it is pretty easy to interfere with stuff, but it is possible to set up situations that are beneficial for you.  You have to keep your eyes open.  But don't think too hard, it's not that serious of a game.

7/1/05 update: dropped it half a point to reflect a decreased desire to play it -- probably due to an overall decrease in my desire to play tile-laying games in general.

A surprisingly combative game; and very thinky for it's seeming-levity and silliness. I prefer it to Tsuro as you have multiple paths (or tracks) to lay, so you're (almost) never out of it as long as you have track to lay.

The graphical design of this tile laying game (train track building in 19th Century Paris) isn't one of Vohwinkel's best...but the game itself is good.Turns are fairly fast: draw and place a tile. The game starts off slow but once the tactical placement is done, watch the lines form.There is screwage but it's all part of the fun. It scales well from 2 to 6 and non-gamers pick it up quickly. Another good Dirk Henn game.Use the advance rules for more of a 'gamers' game: 2 or 3 tiles in hand, tiles need not be placed with arrow following the direction on board.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A good game for &quot;non-gamers&quot;.  The play is simple, next to no rules to memorize yet the strategy is there to keep people interested. Scoring can be a little confusing in the fact that sometimes the tracks are hard to follow after several hours of gaming.

Although it appears to be a puzzle game, I enjoyed my first play. It has an element of 18xx games in that you have to create a rail network that, when connected, will score points based on how long it is and whether or not it connects into a main terminal. Again, it's a nice departure from the basic boardgame and a nice game to introduce beginners into the deeper world of gaming.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Although I feel the original rules break down even with mildly predatory play (especially with 5+ players), I found this very approachable game to be a wonderful balance between offense and defense with a simple change to edge rules: "If you play along the edge, you must show that you are extending one of your own lines".  This opens up a fascinating strategy game of convoluted attempts to fence off your enemies while growing your lines in the same move.  It's a contemplative classic for us that seems to work as well for 2 as it does for 6.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.08
This is a challenging semi-abstract game for 2 to 6 players that seems to play rather quickly.  Perhaps depending on the number of players, it is more important to play offensively than defensively.  You can download the game at

If in the right mood, I like Metro -- but I really, really need to be in the mood.  Part of it is that the multitude of tracks and options are a strain on my eyes, so playing does feel partially like a chore.  But this is a fun game, especially for lighter fare with non-gamer friends.  ESPECIALLY with non-gamer friends who have been to Paris and suffered the horrors of the Parisian tube system.

Nov 2009: Revised down to a 6 after further reflection and not having played in awhile... just very little interest in revisiting it, though it's not a bad game.

One playing with two. Need to play again to make sure there wasn't something I missed. 

Carcassone with trains? I was just staring at the board looking for the best location to screw my opponent or help myself. If I had a computer to point out the maximized move, I would just do that and save the time for me to look at the board. We played the old version where you didn't rotate the tiles, but I don't think that would help anything if I could rotate.

There's just a little too much of an arbitrary feeling in this game for me to rate it in my top tier.  If you get a tile that doesn't help you, you need to hurt someone else.  And usually, there's no rhyme or reason to it.

This game can be cutthroat, brutal and frustrating - but all in a good way. Play moves quickly ... this design is streamlined and strikes a good balance between presenting players with options but limiting them enough to keep things from bogging down.

The best of the build-long-and-winding-tracks games. I like that there is ample opportunity for both offensive and defensive plays, and that all you do on your turn is lay a track tile, so your turn comes around quickly.

Very take-that style of tile-laying and play, and the game tends to end up with a dizzying array of track by the end. I actually enjoy playing it, simply to try and make the best of the constraints because it isn't that obvious whether helping yourself or hurting others is the more valuable play.

TRADED AWAY - This tile-laying game suffers from being very difficult to follow the twisting subway paths with your eyes, I've heard it actually plays better on the computer, which colors in the subway paths with your player color.  I do like the rule of being able to see two tiles,  and trying to reach the center square, but I don't like how the game limits your color choice based on the number of players (like in Austrlia or Entdecker).

Nice filler for up to 6 players (and in my opinion there aren't a great many games that are enjoyable with such a large group). The rules are clear and simple, although some might argue that game options are too few (draw a tile, place it --- next!). Compares unfavorably to a tile placing game like Entdecker (where there seems to be a lot more going on), save for its 6-player compatability.
UPDATE -- Increased the rating by one, now that I found that this must be the best scalable game I own. It actually plays better with two than with six. The ideal number of players seems to be four.

Just way too chaotic. Often times, there is vry little you can do to alter the game. You place your tiles and hope for the best. It is also true that people with spatial recognition issues will have a tough time trying to figure out how to lay down the tiles.

Not exactly a must play for me.

I liked this game.  The first time I played, it took more than half the game for me to realize that it's more about stopping the other players than it is about promoting yourself.  You only occasionally get to make a positive play because it is much easier to predict what's needed to shorten a route than what's needed for a long route.  Perhaps I just need more experiance, but it is a very chaotic game.  While there doesn't seem to be alot of direct control, I still like the game.  It plays very quickly.

I've only played it once, and my opponent was more enamored with the ability to form pretzels & circles out of the loops, but in the end I really like this game.

Extremely dry tile-laying game.  The theme is the building of the Paris metro, but it could have been just about anything.  The scoring doesn't really make sense with the theme, and the map is abstracted to the point where even the most ardent francophile won't be able to see Paris in it.  If you're really into abstract tile-laying games, you might find something interesting here.  Everybody else can safely ignore this title.

Doesnt work as a game - it isn't tense and it isn't intellectually engaging, since you have little to no control over your destiny and the decisions are hardly meaningful or exciting. The gameplay is so unengaging that I felt there was tremendous downtime despite the fact it was probably my turn once every  two minutes. For an excellent game that is vaguely similar look to Aqua Romana.

Basically a pipe-laying game, with a twist or two.  Only played 2-players, and I feel like it would get much too chaotic and uncontrollable with more than, say, three.

This one had a very similar feel to Tsuro, but I liked it a bit better.  In particular, I liked that you could play your tile onto tracks for other trains and influence other players a bit more intentionally.  In Tsuro, the influence you have on others often seems to come more as an indirect result of playing a tile that is most advantageous to yourself since you can only play tiles along your own pathway.  In Metro, you can play a tile to help yourself and possibly affect others or you have the option to place a tile that doesn't affect you at all but does impact the other players.

This is a very fun game, simple, but full of decisions to be made.  Should you concentrate on lengthening your route to maximize points, or work on closing your opponents' tracks, giving them points but hopefully giving them fewer points than if they close them themselves a little later?

And should you dive for those center stations, or try to loop around a bit hoping to score more points before those stations are all closed up?

I've already hooked a few non-gamers with Metro.  All have enjoyed it, even asking me to play it again on subsequent nights.

It's very easy to learn, easy to play, and is a lot of fun. What more could you want?

I had originally purchased this for my 9 yo son (who loves it), but it gets the most points for being one of the few tile laying games my husband is always willing to play (he dislikes Carcassonne).

Good as a mindless filler game when played with 2 (especially if you're married).  With 3, the added time between turns allows players to think things out and it becomes much more of a game of skill.  Excellent components and a nice looking board.  Probably the best tile laying game I've ever played.

i want to try this with more than two people.  maybe then i'll like it better. i've tried it with 4, and i don't like it any better.  it's still somewhat fun, but not great.

Dobra gra logiczna. Niestety nie skaluje się dobrze. Działa dobrze dla dwóch graczy. Dla większej liczby losowość jest imho za wysoka.

Nice logical game. Doesn't scale well. Best for 2 players, for 6 players it's too random.

Wow, I really enjoyed my first few plays -- very cut throat, very convoluted. Interesting to find the balance between aborting an opponents lines for minimal gains versus protecting your own lines with an eye toward lengthy development. Not quite as "friendly" as I was expecting.

Forget that it looks like all those pipe-laying games, this one's fast-paced and fun. Can easily be played with children (I've played it with 8-year olds). It's a very nasty game where you win simply by messing with your opponents, and therein lies the bad. The game is just a constant race to close each other's tracks, instead of extending ones own.

High chance of screwage.  I like the concept but your score really depends on how much your opponents like (or hate) you and how much of a jerk they want to be.

Good game that makes me think to Carcassonne, but focusing on building and controlling streets only. It has the right amount of strategy and works really well with two players.

Excellent tile game.  It's like a puzzle and I really like puzzle games.  If you play the advanced rules and don't follow the arrow, then the game is much better and plays a little more true.

Build train tracks-type of game. Wasn't 100% my cup of tea, but it's an OK game by all means. I might want to play it a bit more to enjoy it more.

Coloca tu loseta en el tablero para expandir tus vias y entorpecer las de tus contrincantes. Cada vía da tantos PV como losetas tenga (si conecta con el centor da el doble).

Fun game. Fast game when using basic rules.

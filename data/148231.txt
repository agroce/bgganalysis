Super funky hand management "area influence" game. It's kind of weird and not all that strategic, but it's also very strategic? The decisions are all tactical, but you can plan and hope for the future in certain ways. Thinking long term is the only way to win the game. 

I give it a 7/10 because it's just so bloody unique and different, which keeps it somewhat fresh.

Area control game that is set in the Corto Maltese universe.  It is actually abstract, but the setting is quite nice because the board is made from different parts that refer to well known stories of the character, each one giving a special point to the board.  The game plays fine, maybe a bit chaotic (but I have only played once with 4 players).
The art is great, specially if you know the comic.

Fun spatial area control game with amazing artwork. Each part of the board (strips) has different rules on how your pieces go out or how they score. So, lots of possible variations. It was interesting, but my group really didn't like it all that much. Think this one will be going to the Trade Pile.

Essen 2013. Absolutely gorgeous presentation which is sympathetic to the source material and uses it well.  The attention to detail looks like a labour of love which should make anyone who is a fan of Corto want to love the game. That approach is reflected to some extent in the game design, with each of the half dozen adventures included with the game having a slightly different feel and both Corto and Rasputin having a big impact when they appear. Any sense of adventure is pretty abstract though; perhaps on a par with Knizia's Lord of the Rings - there is a sense of theme, but it's not overloaded with chrome.  Refreshingly, the gameplay feels rather different, in a good way. There are elements of network/connection building and area majority but it's hard to think of anything comparable.  All in all, it makes me want to play more and I hope that the mystery cards included in the box herald an expansion on the way. Top marks too for a lovingly produced - arguably overproduced - box insert, with appropriate spaces for all the components, including the lovely busts of Corto and Rasputin.

RATING: 7.8
I liked the modularity of the gameboard, the components quality and the graphic novels respect (which impressed me the most).
The gameplay mechanism is based on majority control with a lot of chaos. This latter is a bit like Corto Maltese's life...

Very enjoyable and different area majority(ish) game with a nice slice of theme. Well produced as is to be expected from Matagot although it should have included some gold pieces to denote the VP rather than just using unused cards. Some player aids detailing the card distribution would also have been nice.

Tactical rather than strategic but what you do over the whole game counts - I was worried that the tit-for-tat nature of the game with regards to removing other players tokens would make the early game a little pointless but that is not the case as the various quests mean there are points to be gained from the outset.

Recommended for a light blast in about an hour at the end of the evening.

A very interesting game.  The theme is not perfectly clear to the uninitiated, but the gameplay is very smooth and leads to very dynamic strategies.  The replayability of the game is high because of the various storylines and how they can interact with each other.  Solid stuff.

WE LOVE THIS GAME! The game mechanic is different from what we're used to but different is always a plus in our book! The artwork is based off of the Corto Maltese comic book series and is pretty awesome- very unique in that no other game (to my knowledge) has done comic book illustrations the same way that Corto does it. Grade A!

Rating may go up later, but right now seems a bit too much conflict and kingmaking. I think the goal was an experience game, but if one doesn't know the source material, there's not really enough text for that juice to come through in play. Also find a lack of balance inside each of the decks.

Territory control game.  It's quite fresh, but:

Initial Rating: 4.5 (June 2015)

Before playing the game, I have never heard of Corto Maltese so I didn’t have any expectation whatsoever, however the game was boring for me (even though I won). There are some caveats though, the game explainer didn’t know the rules by heart so it was a slow process and some mistakes were done. We were 4 players and I really think the game is at its best with 3 players, with 4 players there is a lot of chaos and “attack the perceived leader”, a mechanism I have come to dislike more and more these days. It seems the best strategy is bid your time, have a low profile (don’t be the leader) and attack near the end with your most powerful cards.

It is a simple control area game, but it has lots of luck with the cards, also some of the actions seem unbalanced. It is pure luck if you draw a Corto/Rasputin card and they are really powerful. 

I love the game components, the Corto/Rasputin miniatures are excellent and the artwork is very good too.. I also love the idea of having different quests to play each game, for that purpose it seems 6 stories is far too short to have a high replayability factor. 

Bottom line, I think the game can be enjoyed more by fans of the series. I will read the rules and play it again with 2/3 players but for now I’m leaning toward getting rid of the game.

A unique, tactical blend of card placement with area control.  The board is built using a random combination of "story" boards that focus on one of Corto's adventures.  Each one also provides a small addition to the rules.

Après lecture des règles, j'avais une furieuse envie d'y jouer (même si le côté très chaotique me faisait un peu peur).

Et bien, oui, c'est chaotique à fond. Mais il y a moyen de tirer partie au mieux des cartes que l'on a en main : le jeu laisse en effet beaucoup de flexibilité dans les mouvements des personnages et actions à réaliser.

J'ai toujours eu envie d'aimer le personnage, mais n'avais jamais accroché au quelques BD que j'ai pu lire dans le temps. Ce jeu m'a fait acheter l'intégrale des tomes.

Very pleasant game!  Quite surprising as after reading the rules you might not think much of it.  Also very, very chaotic with cards switching control or being wiped out.  But strangely fun.  Artwork is attractive.  The rule about the impact of a card based on the number of onamatapea was nifty.  Not much for theme, but a quick smackdown.

I like the idea of how a game is made up of any combination of the 4 different scenario boards, each with a wibble on how to score points. Those wibbles make it a bit longer to learn for what is otherwise a simple game of putting your markers out to control cards (aka characters) in as big a grouping as you can. When each player is able to play up to 4 cards, there's a LOT of markers coming on and being removed before it's back to your turn, so it's pretty chaotic. But it's in keeping with the short-ish 30 min timeframe so the game doesn't wear out its welcome. The game is typified by its art, which is polarising but evocative, and its backstory (which is full). It's decent but the game-play feels a bit old-school ... which could also be said to be a deliberate feel to keep in with its old-school theme, which in turn makes it a bit more palatable and therefore not marked down harder than it might otherwise.

RATING: 8.5
What a beautiful game! Looks amazing and when I saw its cover I had to have the game as I'm a big fan of Hugo Pratt's Corto Maltese. The game is a Euro-style area control game, but it is really nice and the artwork is fantastic of course, being taken from the comics. You can clearly tell that this game was a passion project, as the production value is way over the top (which is great) containing the most beautiful sculptures I've seen in any board game.

Very enjoyable and fast-paced game that has a really interesting way of combining different "adventures" that interact differently and provide quite some unsuspected depth to the game.

Definitely a keeper and definitely one to hit the table more often.

Not knowing the background story behind this I found it rather abstract and of little interest. I'm sure that, like Martin Wallace's Discworld game, Battlestar Galactica, or Firefly or most other themed games, it would be a better experience if any of it meant anything to me. But it doesn't.

I found the mechanics rather ordinary and rather dependent upon card draw. You seem to attack players based on your limited card draw to the best of your ability, while at the same time scoring where you can. Not for me, and that's down to me, but I can see that some would like it.

RATING: 5
A ridiculously over produced game with cartoons rule-books and action strips instead of a board, and two massively sculpted pieces and cards. All for a pretty straightforward and annoying "take that" abstract game of collecting coins, only a few of which you can collect during the game, and the rest of which go back and forth like a yo-yo until someone who is marginally ahead decides to end the game. Last player is at a disadvantage, and no compensation is given for it. I'm not a fan of "take that" mechanics, and this didn't change my mind; it's good for this kind of game. But it has pretty pieces.

This is a very frenetic area control game with a very high degree of player interaction based on the French comic series of the same name.

In this game a number of boards are lain out each related to a different adventure.  The game comes with 6 adventures and usually 4 of them are used in each game.  Although the layout of these changes this has you playing many of the same adventures every time you play.  The adventures really just make up the spaces of the board and have some minor special rules that don't have the hugest impact on the game though.

The meat of the game is in the cards you play every turn.  You can play any number of the up to 4 cards in your hand but you only draw 2 at the end of your turn until you skip a turn to go back up to four.  So playing all 4 can leave you with fewer options in following turns.  The cards you play go onto the grid-like board layout and typically are characters that either put influence on adjacent characters or remove it.  There are also action cards that put or remove extra influence from surrounding cards in addition to the character you played.  And there are figures representing the hero Corto and his nemesis Rasputin.  Corto scores players bonus points based on their control and puts out extra influence while Rasputin just completely eliminates an already played character card.

This makes for a constantly changing and fluctuating board presence each turn.  You can play a card and by the time 3 other players have gone and it makes its way back to you, you barely recognize the landscape of the board from the last time you played.  Trying to manage the frenetic pace of this game is quite a tense exercise and the entire game takes 30 minutes or less.  I quite like what this game offers at that kind of play time.

It is also worth noting that the components are mostly excellent.  It even comes with two detailed plastic busts to represent Corto and Rasputin.

Area control game. Quick gameplay once the rules are known. Lacks a little depth. I'm looking forward to playing this with three players, expecting that it will give me more 'control' over the game.
Yet to play the storylines with Venice, trains and aces.

RATING: 3.5
Besides games, I'm a big fan of European comics (some would call them graphic novels). Corto Maltese is one of the classics of the genre but I have never read any of the issues. I do appreciate the artistry of Hugo Pratt, he was very good at what he did (graphically at least). But I don't know the material so I can't say if this game does the comics justice. I hope the comics are better in fact.
Visually they took some of Pratt's art, slapped it on the boards and cards and added a background color. And even though the artwork is nice, the graphic design is very bleh. This is not a pretty looking game at all. And the Chinese printer is not the best you can get in China. And the best from China isn't as good as German. So it's not great at all.
But it's more about game play than looks of course. Unfortunately this game has some very generic, abstract mechanisms that don't really tell a story. And there's a good amount of luck in which cards you draw. I know this is a fairly light game, but it still gives you the false feeling that your decisions are important. And they are, until get unlucky with the card draws. So they're not really that important.
I didn't care for this game at all. I didn't like the component quality. I didn't like the game flow. I didn't like the luck element. I didn't like anything about this game except for the Pratt art.

Basically a simple, card-driven area control game - but absolutely DRIPPING with strips & images from the Corto Maltese graphic novels. Talk about an extremely thickly pasted-on theme!

Corto has a really cool art style, but the game itself seems to have nothing to do with the theme. Each of the tracks has a set of special tokens that are supposed to add depth to the game, but it seemed like the best play was usually to just prevent the other player from getting them, thereby nullifying the added depth. Maybe playing with more than two players would spread the conflict around and make the game work better.

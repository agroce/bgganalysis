Way too mean for me.  But I do sort of respect the whole &quot;looking down the line&quot; mechanic - i.e. if I do that, then she&#039;ll do that, which means he&#039;ll probably do that, etc.

Leuke avondafsluiter, want makkelijke regels en zeer kort.

Verrassende dynamiek wel: Je krijgt vaak niet de kaart die je verwachtte te krijgen.  Om een slechte kaart van de "veilende speler" niet te moeten pakken, bied je best een - voor hem - waardevolle kaart.
Als de geveilde kaart je echt interesseert, dan bied je best een kaart die zeer slecht is voor iedereen.

I have only tried this with 3 and 4 players. It's better with 4. I guess the more players the better the game is. It's a quick game.
It's hard to have any strategy other than bid high when you don't want the card offered. But in the end you still get it... ;)

RATING: 2
Yuck, totally chaotic, with no control. I played it blind (just turned my cards over without looking at them) and WON! Yes I made decisions during the game - which card to pick, but they were all rather obvious choices. Awful, the 'mean' aspect doesn't even work for me as I couldn't care less if I won or lost just wanted it to end ...

RATING: 8
A wonderful filler that we bring out quite often.  It will take you a little bit to wrap your head around as the bidding almost seems backward.  As the auctioneer, you offer bad stuff in order for the rest of the table to offer you good stuff!  Inevitably, someone will not think it through during the game and get screwed.  Fortunately, it will only affect them (usually) and no one else.

 You need to chose cards that others will like well enough to avoid you being dumped with the rubbish - a delicate balancing act which feels like a triumph when you pull it off but hurts when you don't.  Fun, if often painful.

Production: Great cards with simple yet appealing art.  Play: I have only played with three players; as such, the game is nearly non-functional; players have almost total control over who receives their cards, and almost no control over which cards they collect for themselves, so it basically degenerates into a trash-your-neighbor scenario, and there are enough all-ruining cards in the deck to allow for negative scores all around.  I'd definitely like to play with more players.  (2+1+1) (1 play)

This is an interesting card game that I thought I had figured out, only to have my strategy backfire in my face every time. It's more complex than it seems! I do enjoy the interaction between players and the ability to screw over your opponents by sticking them with poor cards. Inventive bit of card play mechanics. In general you're dealt a hand that you will eventually pawn off on your opponents in a series of auctions throughout the game. One player ends up putting up a card for auction and each opponent secretly chooses one card they want to tempt the others with. Once each player chooses a card, everyone [besides the player who put down the initial auction card] flips their choice over. Now, the player who put up the auction card chooses a card he/she wishes to take, and then the person whom he/she took that card from chooses one and so forth until the last persons' card that is taken receives the initial card put up for auction. That player then gets to restart the auction by putting a card from his/her hand face up for others to play for. May seem confusing at first, but after a while you can discern which cards from your hand to choose based on how much you want the auctioned card.

RATING: 3
A game of guesswork that hinges upon luck and anticipating the cause-and-effect of which card each player will take. Sometimes you yourself points, but mostly you try to stick someone with a ones that lose them points. I don't mind the fact that you stick other players with losses (heck, I love Dorra's Intrige). At the end of teh day the chaos factor far outweighs the fun factor.

An excellent example of the kind of game that should replace Uno, Skip-Bo or Phase 10.  It can be as nasty as you want it to be, because the game is almost more about setting up your choice for turn order than anything else.  Quick and funny, I'd definitely play this again.

RATING: 8
A fun filler. I can't believe I've somehow not managed to play it until this year. Kind of an excercise in reverse psychology - do I put out something good or bad, and how will the other players react? That makes it a little bit more than a standard filler in terms of weight, as their is a lot of room for analysis.

[1 play] Clever, evil little card game.  There seem to be so many of these that aren't known, and are just as good as the ones that everyone knows. This game has a number of counterintuitive aspects that you have to wrap your brain around.  For instance, the normal cardgame tendency to pick up your starting hand and assess its strength is kinda blown to hell by the fact that you will not get to keep ANY card in your hand, guaranteed.

This game is like Intrige in that ruining each other is integral to gameplay, and that ellicits groans and laughter -- IF you play this game with the right group. Could go over like a lead balloon with some people. Not a heck of a lot of control, and you have more control over hosing people then you do over helping yourself.

Yes, it's a mean card game. Screwing the other players is your bread and butter here. No, it's not random. Not at all. I'd even argue that you have too much control, just not over your own pile but those of the other players (I'll agree that this is not necessarily helpful for your own score, though). And unlike many other games of this kind you need neither panache nor finesse to screw the other players here which makes the whole exercise pretty pointless.

In some ways, The Little Prince: Make Me a Planet is the spiritual successor to this game, using a very similar drafting mechanic but doing away with the undefensible tearing down of other people's score piles.

Played two hands tonight...we didn't finish.  Game rules were straight forward, then we started playing.  Absolute pure luck!  I was dealt a mediocre starting hand.  When the lead player played a bad card, I attempted to play one of my better cards so that I would not get stuck with the lead player's card.  The game was totally random.  By the time you get to the final two or three cards in the hand, it was pretty much a "lay 'em down and take 'em" game. I worked strategically during the first hand and took -25 points.

So for hand #2, I played totally random.  Shuffled my deck each hand, and took the top card.  I scored +30 points in Round 2.

What a pure luck game!

It's a card game about beans but not related to the Bohnanza games.  Basically, each bean is a suit and you want to collect the beans in a certain suit.  The difficulty lies in how you get your cards.  What do you offer to get the bean you want.  You have to be careful as there are cards that will completely negate the suit you have been collecting.  This game is interesting and I think really needs to have more than 3 players.

Only played with 3 - and I assume that it&#039;s a totally different game with 4 or more. The game seems highly tactical with 3 (as you can typically determine who will get which cards). One of the few games that probably plays quicker (and lighter) with 4 or more.

RATING: 2
Annoying mind-bending game, because it's about convincing people to take your card early (so you get a good selection of other cards to take), or late (so you get to take the card on offer).  When you are offering a card, you should offer a bad card so that people will offer you good cards so as not to get stuck with the bad card.  However, the negative cards and 0 cards screw things up, because that makes one person's good card another person's bad card.

I got a better score when playing cards randomly, which tells you how screwed up this game is.

This game is very nice if all players (six, preferably) look beyond their own piles (in such a round, I challenge anyone to play their cards randomly and win!). If not, there isn't much one can do to stop others and the randomness that some people here lament does become a problem.

Surprisingly tactical game. Playing cards at the exact right time is crucial and when done right feels wonderful! That being said, the theme is meaningless, they were just following on the success of Bohnanza, and the game isn't that much fun, especially when almost everyone ends up with negative scores (our scores: -77, -46, 0.

RATING: 6
This is nice card game which plays well with 3-4 players. We played it with 6 players last night, but that tends to reduce player control. The essence of the game is not necessarily to take the best pick for yourself, but to take the pick that will end up forcing a horrible card on someone else. The more players involved the less control of that you have.

One player leads the round and plays one card openly. The other players simultaneously select a card from their hand and reveal it. The lead player chooses one of the now open cards (except his own as nobody is allowed to take his own card). The player who played that card is the next to choose. The card played by the lead player has to be taken by the player whose card is chosen last. Hence, the last two players don’t have a choice. At game end, players score points according to the value of the cards taken. A few special cards add spice, e.g. by negating or doubling points.

What sounds interesting, quickly degenerates into a screwage contest. The best strategy is to keep low profile and spread the risk across the various colors.

Another stupid euro card game.

The scoring mechanism is OK. It's just very confusing to know how the cards are going to move around. Sometimes, you just play a random card from your hand because you just don't see any impact it will have on the game.

RATING: 7
I really struggled wrapping my mind around how this one worked (particularly with three players).  Basically, you know that you will not be getting the cards in your hand which gives you an idea of how to proceed and what else is out there.  You score for each card you collect whether it be positive or negative (each color has 3 "minus" cards which makes scores negative unless you pick up two, each color has one card that ZEROS out the score in that color regardless of what you've collected, and each color has one "2x" card which doubles your score whether it be positive or negative).  You play a card, must select a card from someone else (BUT not the card with the bean counter on it as that must be the last card taken).  So, in a 3 player game when someone leads a card you want, you actually are trying to lay a card that the person does NOT want so that person picks the other person's card - who, of course, may well be trying to do the same thing which means someone gets screwed over.  This is a game with some massive point swings and you do NOT want to get too far in the lead after the first round since you will get a huge target painted on your back!  I think I prefer the 3-4 player game, but find the 6 player games fun in a chaotic sense.

Quick, almost no downtime, definite possibility for both strategy and tactics. I like it. My only qualm with the game is that it's always better to be dealt a high-numbered hand than the other way around. A good player can minimize the impact of a bad hand, so I guess over several round the randomness evens out and skilled players will tend to have a better score.

I find the abundance of card games out there tiresome, but this one's really not bad.
It is driven by a cool little trading mechanic that is a little hard to grasp at first and probably needs to be played with a group that are all "with the program" or the game will sink into randomness.

First impression: There seems to be an illusion of control here. Having right cards at a right time in hand you could actually have some. Played twice with 4 players. I'd like to try with 5-6 players but I'm not expecting much more from it. Not very special game and at least our games took a bit too much time for such a light game.

RATING: 5
Based on one play: A game where you trade cards witch other players. Four cards are put down, three hidden based on the starting players card and then turn by turn you select a card. You simply want to have a lot of positive cards at the end but watch out for negatives and zero cards. At first it is interesting, but once all the special cards and high cards are out, which you need to play in hope of not getting stuck with a bad card, the game gets really dull and you just take the best card you can based on others' initial choices. I'll pass next time.

This can be a fun, nasty game along the same line as Sticheln. But... it's ripe for being metagamed. For example, if the players all combine to make sub-optimal moves for themselves, they can stick the leader(or only the perceived leader) with a very bad card.

RATING: 9
On your first play, the game seems way too chaotic and counter-intuitive. But once players have figured out how to exploit the simple mechanics of the game, they will start finding alternative ways to retheme this game, such as Gang Rape.

In this game, it is very easy for all players to decide to royally screw someone one over. However, being screwed over really only affects your score, not your ability to play, which means if you're screwed over one turn, you can simply screw someone over the next.

Truly evil little card game!
All the cards in your hand will not come back to you.
Try to score the best you can in the four colours.
Watch out for minus cards, multipliers, & the Nicht die Bohne (no score in that colour) cards.
The holder of the bean disc chooses a card from their hand (usually something nasty). Everyone else puts a card from their hand down as an offer. The bean holder chooses one of the offered cards, then that cards owner chooses next, and so on, leaving the final player to take the bean card.
Repeat.
Be prepared for some evil choices as you can sometimes mess people up be taking the card that may not be the very best choice for you but ends up forcing others to take a card that does more damage to their scores!
Watch points tun to minuses, back to positives (two minuses cancel out), get multiplied (plus or minus) or wiped out completely!
Can be subject to mini-analysis paralysis but just chivvy along the slow players!
Not recommended for sensitive souls!

Fiendishly difficult bidding mechanism.  We used the mantra, "if you want that card, big crap" which is surprisingly difficult to get your mind around in the early goings.  The negative and zero cards add an interesting element to the mix and make the game a more rich experience.  Fun filler.

(When rating games I focus on the "how likely I am to play this game again" part of the BGG description rating, as opposed to the "quality" part of the rating.)

I love this game. Full of nasty tactics. You simply have to love a game in which you will never get to keep any of the cards in your hand. :)  Therefore, a hand full of nasty cards is a great hand and a hand full of great cards is the pits. You have to keep on your toes and watch the cards your opponents have already picked up when deciding which of your cards to play as well as which cards available to you you wish to pick up. Great fun as always.

I have to admit this game surprised me.  I was expecting something similar to Bohnanza.  But this one has a totally different flavor.  One of the fun things about this game is that you will not get to keep any of the cards in your hand.  So you have to strategically plan how to play them, in effect giving them(in the case of good cards) and dumping them(when they're bad) to give yourself the best results.  This game gets surprisingly cutthroat...Which of course prompted an immediate 2nd game, the first time I introduced this game to our group.

RATING: 7
Evil in a box.  Don't open it, unless you're playing with good friends who wont mind the massive amount of whoop-ass you're about to unload on them.  It starts out so nice and benign, then all of a sudden there's pandemonium and scrambling to get out of the hand before you're forced to take the card with the chip on it.  And don't bother asking why someone didn't choose your card when it was so obviously better for them.  The answer is clear.  To stick it to you.  Want to play again???

High Society meets Bizarro Universe Bridge. In this strange card game, players try to acquire suited cards. Acquired cards get put into a pile/cascade based on their color. Each pile scores separately and the results of each are added together. A pile's score is the sum of the numeric cards in that pile, then multiplied by 2 for each 2x card present, by -1 for each negative present, then reduced to 0 if a 0 card is present. 

The odd part is the bidding. The last "leader" lays down a card. Everyone else simultaneously plays a card. Reveal. The trick-taker takes the offering he wants. As each player has a card taken from them, they take someone else's offering. No one can take the leader's card, until all other offerings are taken. That last taker becomes the new leader. Play until all cards in our hands are distributed, and then score.

It is a very weird way to distribute cards. If you want to become the leader so you have best pick, you need to play a really bad card that no one will want. Since each player has their own set of scoring piles, what's bad for one person may not be bad for another (or may be neutral). The cards you have in your hand will NEVER go to your piles -- always to other players. So you want to play "good" cards when the leader's offering is terrible, or at least mediocre ones -- you just don't want to be last picked.

Clearly some strategy here but it's ass-backward and not intuitive. Will need another play to see if I can grok it and if the rating goes up.

Nicht die Bohne! -- Played once; four-player.  The play feels familiar, but the mechanics are in fact unlike other card games we've tried.  There are some elements of control, but most often control is either elusive or illusive.  I think frequent play would ameliorate the lack of control.

I think that perhaps there is a really good game here, it is just tough to find it, I suspect that the rating will go up with more plays.  After getting some idea of how to play your hand to bid for the kinds of cards that you want, you can figure out how to leave the remainders to screw each other.  You have to accept that this game is going to be as mean as Sticheln, but I'm just not sure that there is much control.  Regardless, it is a fun filler, if you don't take it seriously.

RATING: 7
Have played with 4 and 5 players.  Plays quite quickly, 2 hands in less than an hour.  It's all about knowing when to play a bad choice to take the bean counter, and when to play a good choice to prevent yourself from being stuck with its card.  Every card in your hand will not count toward your final score--your strategy has to account for that as well.  Pretty darn brilliant!  While I think No Thanks is equally good with 4 (and they are both just as easy to explain), this one begins to outshine it at 5 players when No Thanks starts to get a little more chaotic.  I haven't played with 6, but it would seem that there is not the normal large increase in chaos you typically see as card games have more people playing.

RATING: 6.5
[Amigo Spiele 1999 edition] {Food; drafting, set collection, simultaneous-action} An interesting card game with the unique drafting mechanic. It's unique because those cards in your hand will never be yours. In this game, you have to make use of your cards to 'attract' other players to give you an opportunity to choose cards. It's fast-paced and not luck dependent but it's highly tense and confrontational! If you just want to have a leisure time, you can skip this game because it's so vicious. Sometimes, all players may get negative scores in a round.

I have to say that I was really unimpressed with this game.  We played with five players and it seemed really chaotic.  I never felt like any card I chose to play made much of a difference in the game.  I might just as well have been choosing my cards at random.  Perhaps with fewer players it becomes a little more strategic.  Or perhaps I just don't "get it".  Either way, I don't think I'll be likely to play again.

RATING: 6.7
tl;dr: not sure what to think

This game is quite interesting. It clearly allows for some very clever play. You offer a card to the other players, they make a counter offer. I played this with three. Some say it's not good with three, others prefer it with three. It certainly allows for a lot of control for the players. You can really force the hand of other players in some situations. This can lead to extreme situations where all players score nothing or negative.
So while I appreciate the cool moves this game allows and hope to explore it more, I'm not sure how much I like it. I have very mixed feelings about it.

RATING: 7
The last time I played this game, I was reminded of Sticheln, in that the card you play on a turn isn't really helping YOU, so much as it's hurting other players.  Depending on the sort of gamer you are, it might take a few turns (or games) to realize this, but once you do, the game starts to shine.  I'd recommend having a house rule forbidding table talk, especially if you have a player in your group who is prone to steamrolling other players into doing what he/she wants.  It will be too easy for that player to steer the others into a situation which will benefit him the most.

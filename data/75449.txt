Firenze is a very traditional euro game of action selection, resource management and a race to claim the best building spots. Very straightforward while still offering a good amount of min-maxing your gains without a need to analyse a gigantic decision tree. The amount of information available is limited which makes assessing the situation quite fast but still not too easy.
 
Perhaps the biggest decisions are made when you are selecting the action from the market. There are both, very good ones as well as ones you want to avoid. Basically you are expected to choose the cheapest action but you can skip them by paying resources for every action you skip. This is a good mechanic but unfortunately the decision is not as tight as it could be because there is an abundance of resources and most of the time you can afford skipping without an eyeblink. This is especially true if you manage to get the Warehouse card (=increase your resource limit) early in the game.
 
I enjoy the game for its simplicity and for the decisions it offers. While not super tight, it still fun to analyse the market and see what you can do.

RATING: 7
*Rating based on one play.

This is a pretty fun game of set collection and resource management.  The stacking of the pieces to make towers is rather novel and works reasonably well.  The board is very well done and the components are good (except that the bag that you are supposed to blindly draw pieces from is somewhat transparent).  All in all, a well-done game.  I only rate it a 7 though because it's not very deep and the decisions aren't that complex, plus some of the card effects make for a negative play experience.  The latter isn't too bad, though, because you do have the opportunity (usually) to plan for and/or try to avoid those negative effects.

Need more plays, but a nice light-medium weight game. Some of the cards are pretty powerful. A little fiddly with moving the cards all the time, but not as fiddly as other Euros, so it's okay. Not sure how balanced it is exactly though. Still, the blocks to make towers are fun.

One quibble is that I'd prefer if there were easier ways to put the blocked balconies. For now, I just use the initial suggested setup.

RATING: 6
I like the multi-use currency system.  It is clever and keeps everything pretty close.  The rest of the game is a little dull, but I think it would have some great replayability because of the cards.  Would play again, but probably won't buy it.

RATING: 9
Such a good game. I like how the blocks are building materials, but also currency for the game. Some people think that takes away from theme, but I think it makes for a smooth design. In a game with hundreds of little bits, why add money cards/pieces?

Steding is a master at making interesting games out of simple rulesets. The main player interaction here is in the race for available contracts (tower heights of the various colors) though there are a couple of really potentially dirty cards that can foil your opponents' plans. Needing to build every single turn is an interesting wrinkle that makes planning full of tension, and because the total count of all the colors of bricks is known, it really makes for some interesting decisions. It's pretty quick, very solid. Sucks that its OOP.

This is a clever tower building euro that has very nice stackable wooden bits that are quite frankly fun to play with and stack.  As for weight, this feels like a gateway game in terms of its mechanics, with a modicum of complexity and replayability being found in the card effects.  It has some nice "race to build" elements.  Some might find the card effects to be a bit chaotic and luck based.

Proved a little too complex for 7 and 5 year olds on first play, though I believe they would enjoy it if exposed to it a few more times. But I can see myself liking this one a lot. 
Edit: Now played on Yucata and with other adults at game club. It is a cracker. Tense and very interactive.

RATING: 8
A kind of race to build the right towers.  Interesting card selection system that combines cards with tower blocks.  Action cards introduce some spice, and it has some twists on the possibility to build certain towers.  Easy to learn and nice to play.
I have to admit it is a little bit uncomfortable to place because of the continuous movement of cards and blocks.  It could also be quite prone to AP.
I think it is the kind of game that works perfect on Yucata...

This movie has a great troupe: Andreas "Hansa Teutonica" Steding is the director and Michael Menzel draws at his unmatched height... So, when I read a good review on Spielbox Magazine I decided to buy Firenze, even if the german edition with extensive card text would have meant some work with translated pasteups...
Well, the game is made by well known ingredients: tower building in middle age Florence and card drafting using a the mechanic of Vinci/SmallWorld. It really feels like Thurn and Taxis with tower building, and has the rare weight of a heavier family game and light gamer's game, with the capability of being enjoyable for both target groups. The gameplay is fast and flows well, everything is quite simple, but there's meaningful choices. Definitely want to play it again.

First Play: Draw cards holdimg building tiles, build towers to prescribed heights, score points. Another game with total downtime when its not your turn, there are certain cards which are incredibly powerful in the early game (storage) and the cycle of coloured tiles can really slap you in the face. There is a need to keep an eye on what everyone else is doing.

I have played it only in www.yucata.de and I liked it quite a bit.

It's a very good medium to light eurogame.

*update*

Purchased, custom spanish cards by user Clint Barton included, but first play face to face was a little less interesting as long as you are all the time moving cards, bricks and taking more bricks to the cards... My gaming group didn't like it too much (maybe 4 isn't the best number of players for this game), that made me sad because I find this game fun. Let's see next time but I'll wait and will choose another group to play it.

RATING: 7.5
Firenze is a Euro's euro.  Each turn has a single main decision, which is which card you will take from the card line.  You pay bricks to take cards farther down the line, and these bricks go on the cards you passed over, making them more palatable - very elegant.  Cards offer special powers, benefits, points, or sometimes bad stuff, and give the game a lot of variety.  Then you build towers with the bricks you have in order to score points - taller towers and the more rare colors both increase the points you get.  There is a race element here, as the first person to build a certain number of towers (varies with player count) triggers the end game.  And there's majority scoring for each tower color, so more towers is helpful there.

Firenze is fairly easy to pick up, and plays smoothly. It keeps turns moving, but has a number of small details (e.g., what color brick you use to pay for cards) that give it some depth.  I wouldn't want to play it all the time, but it has a place in my collection as an occasional change of pace.

A lovely, entertaining game, yet again proving that Michael Schacht is the master at these light, family games that present players with clever problems and challenging decisions. It has just enough randomness to make the game variable and unpredictable, but not so much that it will favor one player inordinately over another.

The negative event cards are the heart of the game: no one wants them, but as those tower blocks pile up, they become more and more tempting. The appearance of a Patrician card can create a mad scramble, and provoke someone else to take a negative card just to deny the opportunity to the player who can nullify it. Very fun! The two-player game is a little long, so we'll probably play to seven seals (instead of nine) from now on.

This is a typical eurogame about… well, the theme isn’t really important in this game and it does feel a bit like an abstract. The mechanic of placing tower pieces on the lower cards you don’t want is quite nice. It’s not multiplayer solitaire or a eurogame in which you can only interact with other players by taking the actions they want. Here, there are some mean, spiteful cards which you can actively use to hurt another player, and you always need to take into consideration which towers the other players are able to build as that might affect your own strategy.

A Euro game that plays in under 60 minutes with some good decision making. The cards are straight forward but can be repetitive. It is a highly visual appealing game by constructing physical towers and placing for points. Timing is crucial and there is lots of strategy in the gameplay. Good game for the family and gamers.

RATING: 7
An interesting tower building game with a push your luck element of always having to build towers each turn under the threat of having to tear them down and lose bricks back to the pouch. I liked it, but it didn't really jump out at me as much as I thought it would. This may because with 4 players and only 6 cards on the table at the end of your turn half the cards will be different on your next turn. For that reason I found it to be tougher to develop a strategy than the 2-player game I played on Yucata.

RATING: 5
Players are striving to construct bee-yoo-tee-ful towers in Medieval Florence. (Talk about an overused setting, but okay.) The idea is that building blocks come in from the quarry, and the longer they are on offer, the cheaper they become. But not in an absolute sense: instead of paying more money, the player has to put a building block from his own supply on any lot he skips to get to the lot he desires. This simple idea provides great tension for the players: good lots cost to be snapped up, while the skipped-over ones increase their value as a consequence. The lots are then used to construct towers in your workshop, with another twist: a tower you've begun constructing [i]has[/i] to be added to every turn, or it collapses. Once you reach a certain height you can turn it in for VPs by putting a marker on a major tower on the gameboard, and by that time it becomes clear that you're not exactly putting up a tower, but rather a floor of a tower; you can even put up the top floor before you put in the lowest floor. Thematically weird, but okay, stranger things have happened in board games... Complicating the selection process is that each lot is accompanied by a 'sweetener' or 'sourer': a playing card with good or bad stuff on it. The game ends when a specific number of floors have been constructed, and players are awarded extra points for having a majority of floors in a given tower, or constructing a number of floors of a given size, etcetera. Most points win of course.

Firenze is a nice game to play, and the selection mechanic works well were it not for those damned cards. It is already quite a challenge to be constructing towers in a steady fashion, but the bonuses and maluses conveyed by the action cards can really screw things up for you. Since noone wants to grab a card with a clear personal negative effect (a new card may be very good to someone else!) they tend to fill up the display, thus preventing a good turnover of building blocks at some point. The only defense is hoarding cards which offset the negative aspects, giving the game a bit of a 'comboing'-feel. I'm not sure I appreciate that sort of design. My partner had indicated that she wanted this game at some point, but a replay effort some time later made her change her mind. We're happy to play if requested, but if that opportunity never appears, we're cool with that, too.

This game is a touch too complex for what the game is underneath, but it's still enjoyable to play.  You're simply trying to build up towers in various colors and then decide when to get out by taking the commission for that level.  Complicating matters are certain stages are blocked at the outset, and also there are balconies for big points - but they have to be built in a specific order.  The real tough part is you must build one part of each of your current towers every round, or they get torn down.

The cards give some nice benefits, and the bad ones eventually get so stacked up with tower pieces that you get tempted to take them.  Personally I find their negatives to be a bit too strong in a game where the margin of victory tends to be so small.

All in all a pretty good game, but not a must-have for gamers with a substantial collection.

Great game. I've only played with 2 players. Some of the cards can can be devastating though, so you really have to defend against them by paying attention to what your opponent(s) can do. The game does make it easy to see where you are vulnerable, because most of the bad stuff is laid out for all to see (and chose). I love the mechanism of paying to avoid the bad, and consequently making it more tempting for other's to take. If you can roll with the punches this game can throw at you; this game is very entertaining.

Another themeless tower-building game (does that count as a theme?) of set collecting (colorful, cool little stacking wood bits) and turning them in for points.   Larger sets are worth more points (no surprise) and the first player to turn in X bricks gets a bonus (no surprise).  The players who complete the most sets in each color get a majority bonus (no surprise).   The bricks are selected in a Small World kind of fashion, and that works pretty well.  There are text-heavy cards which include people, buildings, events...  some positive, some negative.  This gives the game some much-needed spice.  It's refreshing to see cards that use plentiful text.  Otherwise, it's pretty derivative and mundane, yet it is simple enough to be pleasant and approachable.   I wouldn't mind playing it a few more times, but I don't need to own it, and I don't expect it to be a game that has much shelf life.

Another old Euro and another fantastic one.  I had been trying to play this for years and finally did.  And it was worth the wait.  You take a card which yields a number of bricks.  Bricks are both currency and building materials.  The mechanism for the pricing of the value of the cards is so clever.  Bad cards will yield more bricks as people leave them, good cards will be snapped up but will often cost more in bricks than the bricks they generate.  Near-genius.

And the game can be really nasty which is refreshing for a Euro.  Just when you are about to build your wonderful tower someone can easily come along and knock it down, or a card they buy may do some other mean and nasty action.  This keeps you on your toes and you can't just play your own little game.

A terrific Euro and one I would love to get a copy of in English.

[b]Rating based on - 50+ plays, 2 player - 3 player[/b]
An excellent game with a simple design and elegant ruleset. Each turn you take a card and the corresponding bricks on that card, in order to build towers and score points. It's a really fun and strategic game. Tension comes from a few sources - do I take the card that will give me a bonus, or do I draw the bad event card myself in order to control its' effect on me? do I spend more time to concentrate on building high for more points, or do I build low and fast in order to reach the end game bonus first and possibly outscore my opponent? The game plays smoothly and great with 2 as well as 3.

Essentially, however, this game was fired from my personal collection by Grand Austria Hotel which has the card sliding mechanism, as well as choices between only positive cards. My other half always had a problem with the 'bad' cards and would only pick them when they were not a detriment to me which was not really the point! As a consequence, and in addition to not really executing the essential strategies, he has not won a single game of this in over 30 plays which is not fun for me. It's still one of my favourite games, but I now play on Yucata.de which is more of a challenge as people are more liable to be cutthroat! It's a lot of fun for me there, and I still win my fair share of games so I'm pleased all around.

Foolishly, I forgot to rate this game when I played it some months back. I recall that at first I really didn't enjoy and did a lot of whining.

I think I made one single error right at the very start of the game, failing to take a particular card I think, and that both set me back and the player who took it forward. But I didn't mark this for my wishlist so I must have liked it enough.

RATING: 6
Lots of familiar elements here. First of all, theme. Tower construction is hardly original, and neither is the location of Florence. Once you have started building a tower you need to add at least one level per turn or scrap it, something people might remember from Thurn & Taxis. New building material and special actions enter play by picking action cards in the way known from Small World: The first card in the display is free, for cards beyond that you need to place one building block on each card skipped.

So how is all of this stitched together? Much of the time, everyone focuses on getting their building blocks together and make sure they won't lose their towers come next turn. As each tower level can only be built once you need to keep an eye on what your opponents are working towards but that's often incidental and not something you can do much about except to switch to some other tower. Except for the fact that the action cards include a number of potentially very nasty negative events. You can lose stories from your unfinished constructions, warehouses can burn down, and people can sneak over and steal your last much-needed purple brick.

These events in particular put an emphasis on good timing which, unfortunately, often depends quite a bit on the luck of the draw. If events hurting you turn up at inopportune moments there is not a lot you can do about that save for preparing for any bad events regardless which is very inefficient. While that is not a game breaker, the game also fails to provide anything out of the ordinary. It really does feel like some mediocre frankensteinian construction with parts scavenged from various sources.

A very pleasant tower building game, with action cards purchased with a Small World cost system. Smart, efficient rules make this one easy-going but challenging enough for a good use of an hour. Not meaty enough to satisfy what I normally look for in a Euro, but I wouldn't refuse to play again. It has a nice race element to it as well.

Played in English on yucata.de. This game just works sweetly - you can see far enough ahead to make plans, there's some chaos but nothing you can't deal with. Also, you get to pile blocks up, and that's always a bonus.

When I first played this I wanted to buy it, but it doesn't seem to have been released in English, nor been available in Australia... and now it's an old game so I'll never buy it.

My rating is for 2 players only.  With 3 or more this drops to a "2" rating.

I think this is one of those games in which you have an ability to think longer term with 2 players (the usual 2-3 turn look-ahead of a middleweight euro).

and then:

At 3+ players - chaos takes over, you can't plan at all and the game becomes completely tactical and random.

So, I'll try it again with two, but not with more.  The components are excellent and there are a decent number of twists that make it interesting.   My one concern is with cards and situations that cause the game to bog down.  We'll see after a second play, if I ever get to play it a second time.

RATING: 6
Initial rating after the first play at yucata. It looks like a more cutthroat and complicated Finca. I like it, althought I'm not shure if I'd like to add it to my collection. Would need to try real gameplay.
I'm not shure if it's good or bad, but it seems like it's has more depth than it seems at the first sight.
The other question is - does the random cards help or injure that depth?
The other thing is that it's extremely dry!
And it kills it for me. Don't want to play it anymore.

The colorful, chunky wooden tower pieces are a pleasure to hold and stack. Maybe I'm shallow, but those pieces along with the beautiful board are a large part of the enjoyment I get from Firenze.

There's nothing especially new here. But Firenze is mechanically solid, emphasizing tradeoffs between collecting a lot of pieces, collecting the right colors of pieces, and getting the most useful cards. The system also challenges players to assess the risks and benefits of building towers quickly or slowly, and taller or shorter. I also appreciate the opportunities to sabotage your neighbors' efforts - something you don't typically find in this kind of family-weight Eurogame.

Rather enjoyable tower building game. Reminds me of Ticket to Ride, except you're building up instead of out. The cards add an additional layer of interest.

From the designer of Hansa Teutonica comes a tower building game. Cards hold the blocks you need to build the towers to score points. I'd suggest placing the blocks benath the cards and then moving the blocks and cards along as the cards advance. Still fiddly, but at least the cards can be picked up and read more easily.

Wow!  What a nice surprise...

This game is a proof that a classic euro-game genre is not dead yet.

Firenze is all about planning, adjusting to ever-changing situation and fierce competition.  Despite the traditional goals (completing orders and achieving majorities) it feels really fresh.  Tension is high all the time and the game is just fun.

Challenging decisions await you, much more difficult than the printed playing time would suggest...

Recommended.

Waiting for expansions (esp. new cards) - the game seems very fit for them!

EDIT: Sometimes the control is unsatisfactory and there is nothing you can do about it, but it's not so big deal.  Rating '8' stands.

RATING: 7
This game has the Palaces of Carrara vibe to it. The mechanics are quite similar in that you pick your construction materials and then build it on a tower. What sets it apart though is the constant need to top up the tower or else it collapses to half the size. The cards also adds a strategic element to it. Plenty of take that type of cards to mess with your opponent's plans and some cards encourages/discourages you from picking the card purely by adding or reducing your VPs. The late game feels like a scramble to fulfill remaining commissions before it runs out. 

Good game and I'm on a lookout for this grail game.

Initial Rating: 5.5 (April 2017)

I generally like Andreas Steding´s designs. I absolutely love Hansa Teutonica and I like The Staufer Dynasty so I was expecting a lot from Firenze. I like the structure of the game, but it is much lighter than I was expecting, perhaps family light.

The rules of the game are easy to teach. You can do it under 10 minutes. 

The game´s decisions aren’t very hard. You only need to see all the options, read all the cards and the best one will be rather obvious. I like the card system (similar to Through the Ages) and you need to pick a card per turn. Also there are colored bricks in the cards and you need to pick the right colors. Once you analyze this, the best card to pick isn’t difficult to pin point. Later, you can trade for the colors you need, thus, diminishing the seriousness of the colors in the pick a card phase (although you trade 3 to 1 so the price is steep). Once you chose the card, everything is pretty straightforward. I really expected a more deep game.

As players need to read all the cards every turn, I think it is best with two players. 

Bottom line, Firenze is an ok game, mechanically sound and perhaps it has the correct weight to be enjoyed by families, but it is too light for me, I was expecting meatier decisions. I need to play it more times to see if it improves with time but for now it is, somewhat, of a disappointment for me.

Current Rating: 5.0

I have a very low tolerance for same-as-it-ever-was Euros that recycle the same tired mechanisms that have been around since the turn off the century, so I didn't have high expectations when this was proposed and explained.

However, it turned out to be much better than expected. It mixes set collection, a straight copy of Vinci/Small World's method of choosing from a display with more recently introduced cards (and the set-collection resources added to them) costing you more by adding a resource to each of the cheaper cards you passed over, and some simple card special abilities.

The relatively short game time, the attractive, stackable roof tile/resource pieces employed (rather than the basic cubes they could just have used) that support the tower building theme, and the ability to screw with the other players through some of the card abilities (as well as the more usual Euro take a card/resource to deny it to an opponent mechanism) add up to an enjoyable if not Earth-shattering Euro.

This game plays incredibly well! It is just so elegant the way the bricks are used for everything! Choosing which cards to grab is very interesting, and knowing when to play them can make or break your ability to complete the towers you are working on. Very fun!

Draft cards from a common card row, they also come with building blocks of various colours. Race to assemble temples of like colour to score points. Different incentives exist for building in different colours and different heights. You can construct a temple slowly over several rounds but if you don't add at least one brick to it each round you will lose all of it.

Things I like:
~The mix of incentives on the towers is nice. It leads to hard choices.
~Drafting from a common row as a means to value the cards is a nice idea.

Things I don't like:
~Far too much negative interaction. The game is a chaotic mess of take-that cards.
~There are other things in the design that bother me to various degrees but the previous point is so overwhelming that I can't be bothered articulating them :)

RATING: 7
Firenze went largely under the radar which is a pity as it's a good medium complexity Euro with some depth that should play FTF in an hour. The theme of building towers in Italy is one of the most unoriginal ones. Patrician comes to mind immediately. But it's spiced up with action cards, has a race character in competing to build certain tower elements first and even features area/tower majority.

RATING: 7
A really beautiful looking game that doesn't mechanically offer anything specifically new, but rather feels like a mix of drafting from Small World, building rules and scoring bonuses from Thurn und Taxis and the rarity to points ratio from Bohnanza. The action cards offer heavy possibilities for huge swings, but also balance themselves quite nicely. The problems of the game are to some point the building block hoarding that makes especially building the purple and blue towers quite hard and the fact that the game gets a bit too repetitive towards the end, partly because of the aforementioned hoarding.

middle-weigh euro.  It was okay.  Didn't really grab me but there wasn't anything wrong with it.  I'd play again if asked but wouldn't request it.  The order of cards coming out adds some variability but I'm not sure that that equals engaging replayability.

I get the feeling there are a few strategies and I suspect this one would get a littlle stale for me after a few plays.

This is very close to Asara. Firenze would get at least 6.5 from me, if they had made better solution with the special cards: now it slows down otherwise so easy and smooth gameplay, because the building bricks blocks the cards and all the information in written - WHY they didn't use symbols instead!?! So, if I had to choose between this and Asara, Asara would win.

I want to like this one.  This is fairly straightforward to play as long as you have English text on the action cards.  The action cards are either instant use, character cards to use once later, buildings which are permanents, cathedral cards which give a bonus for first to achieve, and celebration cards which grant end game points for different conditions.  Drafting the cards is done a la Small World where you can take the first action card for free but must pay one brick to each card you skip up to your selection.  Each card starts with four random bricks.  Each person is seeking to build towers for points and the first one to build six towers gains an additional 5 points and brings the game to an end. 

I don't like this one as my plays have generally seen someone pull the bum rush strategy and end the game quickly and win.  Yes, I expect we could counter that if we all worked together. However, that takes several repeat plays and I've moved on to other games.

5-5-14-First game of Firenze today!  Actually it was quite fun (2p) and, as usual, I found out all kinds of things about the game that I really didn't understand from just playing on yucata.  It seems I am incapable of fully reading the rules on line.  Gah!  Anyway, a very 'take that' aggressive type of game where you're meddling with your opponent(s) builds a whole lot.  Miles does not like to do 'mean' things to me in games but has gradually come to understand that he is not really being mean to me when the game is structured that way and we play for fun with good attitudes.  So we did have fun with it, so much so that he asked to play it again tomorrow. :)

I LOVE it! The board is gorgeous--it really draws you into the game. The rules are streamlined. The bits are solid. And the gameplay is tense and brings out, in the words of my wife: "a giggly fun" feeling. I'm so glad I was able to find a copy of this. I could see this becoming one of our favorite games. 

Update 7/16/15:

After a second play, I am certain this is a special game. It's so simple, but what it does, it does so well. It's very similar to Palaces of Carrara in several ways, and while I like Firenze more (primarily because of the cards), it makes me want to play Palaces again.

2.. very unrated game. Its fairly short and meaty. You can win with the slam low cost towers aswell as scoring the very high ones. CONS there is no catchup mechanic,if u make a mistake you are done.

Gift to Anna together with a trip to actual Florence. She won our first game and liked it. Beautiful art by Michael Menzel, as always. The upkeep is a little bit annoying though. Have to play with more than 2P. I suspect it to be better.

Update after a long hiatus: I really appreciate the game more now for the simplicity and elegance of it's design. The upkeep is still what hinders it from gaining at least 0.5 points in my book. With 2P one is really constantly moving cards and placing new stones, while the opponent is taking his turn, to make the game moving at a quick pace. In turn, you're not really paying attention what your opponent is doing. This would definitely improve with a higher player count.

This game doesn't know what it wants to be.  It sets up as though it is trying to be a medium weight euro, but it certainly doesn't play that way.  Players have very little control, at least in a three-player game.  It plays more like a light family game.

I think stripping the game down and making some tweaks would make it better.  I would start by getting rid of the cards (but not the assembly line with increasing prices) and focus more on the hand management aspect, which is actually very interesting.

Good game, nice fluent mechanisms, good coherent game, that doesn't try to do too much. What it does, it does right. The game is essentially a race to build towers for majorities in the towers of different colours. A race also to place your 6 building seals to finish the game. I like it, good interaction.

Players draft cards, collect building blocks and build towers of different colors.  Each card has randomly drawn blocks on them and you pay zero for the first card, 1 for the next, etc.  Some cards have events that provide points for the highest tower, make players pay building blocks, etc.  Some cards provide extra powers such as paying less to build towers -- the currency in this game are the blocks you need for building.  A very well designed game as regards balance and competition but I must say it's not entirely exciting.  On the other hand it can be played within an hour.

Very much in the vein of Kiesling's Vikings and Kramer/Kiesling's Palaces of Carrara--get bricks, build towers, fill goals. The cards with the bricks are a mix of beneficial ones and disastrous events, so as in Vikings you can end up forced to eat a bad card if you don't watch out. Decent game, can be very aggressively passive-aggressive, but it's not a favourite. Worth playing occasionally on Yucata online.

This is a great game with simple rules and mechanics but don't let that fool you. Hiding underneath that seemingly simple exterior is a game with innumerable decisions. These decisions are more difficult to make than I originally expected. The game packs a punch. The towers are awesome and super fun to build.

Yet another tower building game (a theme which once was interesting, but has now grown tiresome), but this one has the added "fun" of take-that cards. This one rubbed us all the wrong way and had us begging for the game to end. Oh, yeah... I won - a trend I'm finding with all these recent games I wind up hating. At least I can't be accused of sour grapes or rating a game based on my personal outcome at the end.

RATING: 8
I have only played this game on Yucata.de and I have enjoyed it thoroughly.  Idea of the game is to finish different sized towers for points, each size/color of tower can only be completed once so there is a bit of a race to finish.  To acquire building tiles you need to select a card that has them on it, this card will have an effect you either hold on to use, use immediately, or hold onto for end game scoring.

The game is easily explained and has apt opportunity for clever play.  It also looks really nice and I would love to pick up a copy if it was easier to acquire here in the States.

[b]Firenze[/b] was sold via auction 8/2/14. 

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]This is a tough one. I really enjoyed playing this game, but unfortunately my family did not (they found it boring). Firenze has a very clean and streamlined rule set that offers a lot of variety in the tactics you employ to play the game. There is nothing fiddly about this game.

I really enjoyed the tension created by having to manage only one resource in the game (the tower pieces are also your currency). The cards really give this games some legs and help increase player interaction. I also appreciate how the cards also function as a market of sorts were the new tower pieces are placed. It creates some great moments where you only want/need the card or tower pieces but you are forced to take either a card or building pieces you don't want. 

This is another great family game that I would probably recommend, but the theme is very dry and for my family the game play got repetitive after a few plays. I also don't think that this game plays well with 2, most of the tension is lost and each player ends up doing their own thing. It also didn't help that I got The Palaces of Carrara around the same time and that has been a hit with my family, especially my wife, and it plays great with 2.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Plays good with 2, but better with more.
- This game is a bit simpler than Palaces of Carrara which means that my kids feel more confident when playing this game.
- The building blocks are also the currency for the game used when purchasing a card farther down the track.
- The addition of the cards introduces some more strategy into the game because not only do you get the card effect (good or bad) but you also get whatever blocks are stacked on that card.
- This game is very easy to teach[/i]

I liked the Vinci/Smallworld mechanism for accumulating card powers and resources, paying resources in colours you don't want to get to a card with either/both a power and resources you do want. The game also featured the Amun-Re mechanism where you can build as much as you want (pretty much) but it will cost you extra spare resources. Which provides choices on how quickly to spend to build to beat your opponent to building something. But mostly you want to be as efficient as possible and avoid colours that others are building so they'll leave those colours in the draft for you to pick up. So turns were interesting enough, but at the end, you're just collecting colours to build colours, and anything you build is much the same, bar you want to win some majorities in some colours. Which makes for bunching of points and a rather soul-less endeavour stripped of desire to be replayed. A game needs to be more than just decisions to grab me these days - give me at least a token theme immersion rather than a tower-building retread.

RATING: 9
It's a shame this game is so hard to find.  It's really great!  The combination of selecting your action card (which can be good or bad for you) versus selecting which colored bricks you want makes the start of each turn very exciting.  Then you have to make sure you continue to build on your current towers each turn, otherwise, you lose them!  And all the while, you're racing against the other players to be the first to build the tallest towers and earn the bonus points!  Just fantastic!
My friend Jason found this on the used game shelf at his FLGS and knew I wanted it.  I'm lucky to have it.  Thanks, Jason!

RATING: 8
This is a neat little tower-building game.  I really love the draft in this game--it's a Through the Ages-style draft where you have to pay more for cards that have been revealed more recently.  Plus, there are catastrophes among the cards, so you may want to spend extra for other cards, but at some point you may have to suck it up and just take it.  You're building towers, and you have to keep adding to them every turn, adding a sense of urgency.  Plus, you have to claim contracts before other players (but aren't usually screwed if they get there first), so the game has a good sense of competition and interactivity.  Overall, great game.

(5+ plays)

RATING: 3
Draw a card among the 5 cards that are currently faced up, earn the bricks on the top of this cards and build a tower or continue your existing ones and finally "commit" them for points, if you want to. The card drafting mechanism is similar to the civilization cards in Stone Age, as newer cards have a "cost" that has to be paid with materials. The theme integrates nicely with the game mechanics.

Downtime is pretty big, since new cards pop up the moment a card is taken. Each player has to read the text on the cards and understand it. On the contrary, new cards in Stone Age pop up only at the beginning of each round, so you can explain them all at once and there is no text; just straightforward symbols.

Overall, Firenze is not hard to understand and play, but pretty much a straightforward game, with less options to score victory points, compared to Stone Age. I found it boring, repetitive and dull. There is some hidden scoring at the end, but overall it doesn't affect the game much; newbies can easily be thrown off by falling behind, something that Stone Age brilliantly covers.

If Steding keeps making games like this, he will go up a lot in my favorit desinger ranking. This is the 3rd game of him I play (other are Hansa Teutonia and Norenberc) and this one is smoother and faster, maybe a bit more a family game;

However, I won't buy this as long as it only exists in German, as it's a strong language dependent, which is a pity :(

It is not a bad game, genuinely a great idea. Just felt like their needed more that can be done among players.

RATING: 6
A tower building game with a ton of numbers. Seriously, there are 6 different colors with varying number of blocks, the game board is pretty much a table that tells you that you get x points for y blocks of color z, there are bonus points for certain levels in certain colors, first to certain levels and first to x towers. Cards may give you points or take them away, you can exchange blocks for other blocks, you may lose half of your blocks if you can't build a tower, or to cards...

All this information obfuscates a simple block to points conversion rate, so there is some choice involved in which cards to take, when to exchange blocks, when to build, when to finish, &c. But still, it's just numbers. Pick the option that gets you the most blocks/points, or the most points per block. Keep doing that until you win. It's the 'Stone Age' problem, where there is no board state, just numbers.

The cards are the clever bit, though. A la Small World, you have to put a block on a card to avoid taking it, until there are so many blocks on one that someone takes it anyway. And some cards are really bad (like lose a tower, or lose three points), while other really help you, or mess with your opponents, which is always fun. There are races going on, so you do have to pay attention to your opponents. But it's mostly just playing the numbers, which is something I very much dislike in games.

RATING: 9
The general idea here is that there is a conveyer belt of powerful cards, each has four random colorful tower pieces placed on it. On your turn, you select a card from the row that you want, paying a tower piece to each card along the belt as you travel from oldest to newest card. Then you take the card, and collect all the pieces on the card. After resolving the card, you can build stacks of tower pieces, and then chose to complete one of the towers, which is how you actually score. Players compete to be the first to score each height requirement for each of the different colors. Then there are bonus points for having the most levels on each color of tower. The real beauty of the game is that many cards actually have negative effects for the player who takes them, but as players skip over them they become more and more lucrative.

It seemed so promising. Rahdo's playthrough looked interesting, the rules were simple, and there appeared to be plenty of player interaction, both via the regular game mechanics and via spiteful use of cards.

Really good tower building game. Towers must be added to each turn or be pulled down. 
Clever card system where new bricks come on cards that can be either good or bad; pay valuable bricks to avoid the bad ones if you can. Bad ones become more tempting as bricks build up on them.
Complete towers to score points.
Only one tower of a set height in each colour, so you may be forced to go higher by someone else completing first!

Firenze is one of those games that fits perfectly into the niche of being simple enough for casual gamers, yet having enough strategy for serious gamers. I could see this game being especially interesting if all players had intimate knowledge of all of the cards.
I think Firenze works with both 3 and 4 players, but only play with 4 if you want more confrontation. The nasty cards are definitely more noticeable when you're cycling through the deck faster.

Overall: A nice light-weight game with enough depth to keep me interested. The mechanics are tight and the components are beautiful. Happy to have it in my collection

Quite pleasant Euro game with an entertaining main mechanism. There is a bit of card drafting connected to the resource gathering and some of the cards even have a take-that component. Actually, Firenze does not feel like a modern Euro game. From mechanisms and theme, I would have assumed it rather to be an early 2000s game from Knizia than a 2010 realease. One hand there is nothing spectacular or innovative, but on the other hand there are not overly complex rules for complexity's sake, as some more modern games have.

This is way better than I thought it would be. I was afraid it would be too abstract, I do not like most abstract games at all. The design is brilliant, we love this game! It has the same if not more tension than Ticket to Ride - you're afraid someone is going to score a balcony before you do. 

After multiple plays you start seeing more strategies. The different cards are great, and the game has some neat mechanics. Combine that with excellent components, a very well written rule book, and it plays great with 2 players - this game is an absolute winner. This game should easily be in the top 100. My best game from 2013. I'm keeping this one forever. Recommended highly.

I have played this a lot (but always without the Campanile) on yucata.de. I think that this game is balanced very well, which means same chances to win for all players. Luck plays a minor role in this game: only the cards that are laid out for sale are drawn from the deck by chance. But selling these cards works like an auction: You may buy newer cards by paying more bricks, whilst the paid bricks are laid down on the cards left behind increasing their value for the other players.
The 'building towers' theme of the game is nothing new, see e.g. "Der Palast von Eschnapur", but this game works perfectly well.

This game demands good planning.  I got completely stomped in my first play.  I'm playing again and giving it the thought process it demands and deserves.  Good game.

Completed the second game on Yucata with a last-turn win this time.  This game has some opportunity for some take-that play, which I normally dislike.  I think this game is just fun enough for me that I don't care.  Increasing my rating from 7 to 8.

Takes the bidding mechanism found in Vinci and ramps it up with a few twists and turns. With some cards being outright bad for you, block swapping adding extra value to the cards, half built towers needing further blocks to avoid dismantling and lofty tantalising goals to be reached, the decisions are interesting.

Rules are light enough for a seven year old to play well, so it fits into the family game category. At the same time it's certainly interesting enough for adults to play, so it a good game for spanning between groups. With a 60 minute play time it'll make it to the table often even if it isn't a revolutionary game in terms of ideas. With lovely production quality and artwork it's a keeper.

Firenze isn't a game that'll blow you away, but it is very solid with meaningful decisions to be made and risks to be taken. I've found it to be an entertaining 60 minute game that's worth bringing out to table with a variety of groups.

Firenze --

My first impression upon seeing the board was that there wasn't much to have fun with: Six rectilinear towers, each tower six segments tall, differing from each other only in color.  What struck me next was how out of place those towers looked against that Florentine backdrop.  They simply didn't fit the setting.  That said, the artwork is downright beautiful, and the graphic design allocates space appropriately.  The cards balance utility with aesthetics.  I thought it was odd that the little board which depicts the Construction Site didn't also provide space for Storehouse.  That quibble aside, the production quality is as good as I've come to expect from European publishers.  Still... Florence?  Nobody could come up with a theme where those towers might be believable?

When I learn to play games, I like to make inane comparisons.  The more non sequitur the better.  For example, when I learned how to play Pickomino, I might have said, "So this is basically Cosmic Encounter Lite, right?"  Or maybe, "Die Macher on steroids."  Well, when we started playing, Firenze I jokingly said, "This is just like Thurn und Taxis."  A short time later I realized there actually was a significant point of similarity.  In Thurn und Taxis, you must add to the route remaining in front of you from your previous turn.  If you do not add to it, you must discard the entire thing.  In Firenze, you must add to any towers currently under construction which remain from a previous turn.  Any towers you do not build higher will be destroyed.  (Half of their blocks going to the general supply and half going to your personal supply.)  I like this mechanic in Thurn und Taxis and I like it here, as well.

2015: 9.  I don't even remember how I got turned onto this game, but I just love the mechanics.  The decisions are tough in this "race" game and managing your progress can be tricky when you're trying to hit certain heights.  There's some "take that" player interaction but not anything you can't plan foresee coming at you from a distance and can adapt to with a little careful planning.  The game looks beautiful too.

Mostly been playing this online but finally scored a copy through the Geek Market, can't wait to get it to the table with friends!  UPDATE: played it with friends, and it's pretty great. Love it, and my friends did too. :)

I really enjoyed this. It's got some awesome tension in it, as you constantly have to be increasing your buildings but there's also a race to have certain buildings first. Also, buildings under construction are susceptible to opponent cards being played against them. I also like how it's hard to keep a bunch of blocks, so you can only "build up" for so long before being forced to make a move.

This game has a nice mixture of acquiring resources, cards with actions/abilities (good and bad), building, racing, and point accumulation. I like that the balconies and neutral tower levels can be set up differently for each game.  The instruction book is well-written and easy to follow.

Hey, we're building towers! Again! 

Well, sort of. Here, you can build the tower levels in any order you like (as long as it hasn't been build already). To build them, you try to collect sets of appropriately colored building material ... by drawing them out of a bag! Feels a bit like Thurn and Taxis (add to what you've started previously, put together a set before placing onto the board, race to be first to make sets of specific sizes for bonus VP, card drawing -- albeit with a different mechanism more like Vinci). 

Not exactly a richly thematic experience, and not a lot that is new, but as a game this works surprisingly well! 

--- Summary ---
The board shows several towers in various colors, with 4 randomly chosen tower levels covered by a neutral color. There are wooden tower pieces (recycled from Patrician, it looks like) in these colors in varying amounts; the tower levels in rarer materials are worth more VP. Players start with a number of white (the most common color) levels in Supply (max 10 in Supply at any time), earlier in turn order getting fewer. There is also a row of spaces on the board for cards, each with 4 random tower level pieces. Several one-time bonus tokens are on the board (like Thurn and Taxis: e.g., first level-7 built earns bonus VP; first level-6, etc.). Finally, 4 tower levels are randomly designated to score bonus VP (chit placed on those levels on the board; these may only be built in the order specified on the chit).

On your turn, you must take a card; these are acquired Vinci-style, with you taking the first for free or skipping as many as you like from the end of the row by adding a level to each card skipped. The empty space is immediately filled by sliding the rest of the row forward (along with the pieces on each card), and drawing a fresh card from the deck (adding 4 level pieces from the bag to that card space). Some cards have immediate effects, others go into your hand to be used later (once) or to your display area to modify the rules for you or score VP at game end, and some go to Church spaces on the board and specify conditions to score bonus VP (e.g., next player to build a level-6 tower piece).

After choosing a card, you may trade ONCE, 3:1, for any level on the board. Next, add 1+ tower piece to any tower you've started to build in your work area; if you are unable to add to a tower, discard half it's pieces to the bag and return the remaining to your Supply. 

Then, build 1+ levels on the board -- return a tower of matching height (e.g., 3 tall to build a level-3 piece) from your work area to the bag, place one of your chits on that space of the board, and score the appropriate VP (higher levels earn more) along with whatever bonuses are available.

When a player builds their last level (each player has 6? level chits), that player earns a bonus 5VP; each other player gets 1 more turn, then the game ends. Score any bonus VP from the cards; the player with the most VP wins.

A classic Euro game with mechanics I fairly enjoy, the theme is not spectacular (tower building in Florence) but since you actually build little towers in front of you it suddenly is fun. Player interaction is low but you will want to try and block them here and there. With nice strategical choices I think it is a really good game for its length (~45 min). Seems to work well with 2, 3 or 4 players. I actually adore it more and more with more plays, great little game!

Tower building in Renaissance Florence!

It's actually a really solid, smooth & attractive middle-weight game. Maybe nothing over original, but the elements combine well, especially the card selection, the need to continue building towers you've started (a hint of Thurn & Taxis), and a race to claim a bunch of singular scoring opportunities. Some of the action cards introduce a little take-that.

Placing the bricks on the cards can make it tricky to look at the cards, so I've adopted Brian's idea of putting the bricks below the cards and sliding them together.

A perfectly decent if deeply unspectacular Euro. There's no real arc to the game; each player is simply doing the same thing all game long.

Oddly, many of the cards are neither good nor bad, leaving players indifferent to them which seems an odd design choice when selecting the cards is such a big part of the game.

Compete for the building blocks you need and try to get some good cards in the process. You need to watch what the others are doing so you can time the completion of your towers and don't get stuck without the blocks you need which would force you to tear down the work of several turns.

RATING: 7
A solid light Euro with some interesting twists. A game of timing to build up little coloured towers in order to claim a range of buliding contracts, salted with a variety of special power cards vinci-drafted from a line on display. A neat mechanism required you to add to every tower you are building or discard them as abandoned _before_ you can score them, forcing Thurn and Taxis style forward planning.

I was concerned that the various special actions would cause too much randomness, but once folks played with some consideration for the cards on display, things moved along smoothly and it instead became a dance of timing and opportunity in claiming contracts. Better balanced that I'd imagined between the various scoring opportunities.

Thematically there is nothing new here... you are building towers for prestige.  But I like the mechanics of the game.  You get bricks by taking cards which can help or hurt you.  Newer cards cost more bricks.  Building is a little tricky as every round you have to increase a tower or tear it down and there are completion restrictions that mean you're competing with others and trying to hit/avoid certain levels.  The more you build the more wasteful you are, but it's a race to be the first to finish as well.  It's a little bit of a lighter game for me, but still interesting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
[thing=75449][/thing] is a sort of light-ish game in which you collect cards and bricks in order to build and gain prestige. Be the best builder of Florence and win the game!

The turn is simple: you choose a card from a row of 6 cards - each card start with 4 bricks on it. All of the cards have either an action linked to it or will provide points. Not all actions are good ones, and not every card will give points to you - like "the player with the highest tower under construction will gain this card which is worth 3 PP". So you will, sometimes, want to pass over some cards. To do this you pay one brick, which goes on the card you passed over. So, it will happen that some time, even the bad cards will start to look good, with all those bricks on it. Also, it might happen that one player won't have bricks to pass over it. It is basically the same way the choice of the races in SmallWorld happen.

After you take a card, it will go to your hand, to other player (see the example I gave above) or to the board, because is a conditional card ("the first player to complete a 5 level comission will gain 2 PP"). The cards with actions that you take into your hand you can use in the same or the next turns - but you must be aware that there is a 6 card limit to have.

Then you can trade 3 bricks for one of the bricks in any of the cards in the row. The 3 bricks go to the card, and you take the brick you want. Now it is time to build. You can start any number of constructions or put any number in buildings already in construction, but up to 2 bricks you don't pay, above this and you must pay with bricks to put more bricks. Any building under construction must receive one brick each turn, or you will have to dismantle it, losing half of the bricks on it. This is where the careful management enters in action: you want to build fast, but, sometimes you will have to build slow in order to give time for new bricks of the color you need to appear in the row (every time a card is added to the row, it comes with 4 new bricks from the pouch) or to some card in the end of the row, with the bricks you need, to descent a few steps in order to became less costly to take it. Is risk management, since you know, beforehand, how many bricks of a given color there are in the pouch and that some of the colors have less bricks (white have the most, purple the least), so you can calculate your odds.

After the building (and dismantle of buildings) you can fulfil comissions if you have buildings tall enough. For every comission you fulfil, you put your seal there - no longer that spot can be build (so, say you fulfil the level 6 of green, this level won't be open again until the end of the game) and take the prestige points for it. There will be 4 spots, randomly choosen, where there will be special comissions that will be worth extra prestige points - but they must be fulfil in order (so, first the I, then the II, and so on) - this is a major point of competition, since these spots are worth many points.

The game ends in the round as someone is out of seals (the player that is out of seals first gains 5 PP). Once the round ends, so it will the game. The points from cards taken during the game will be added to the points of the fulfilled comissions, and the player with the most prestige points is the winner!

[thing=75449][/thing] is sort of a race game - everyone building as fast as possible to fulfil the same comissions, but, of course, someone could be building a green tower, while you are going for blue and white, and other for red. But, with more or less time, someone, more than one by the way, might be building in the same color as you. And with limited supply of bricks you can see where this can go. You wanted to fulfil the level 5 red, to gain the extra bonus points, but is better to fulfil a level 3 or 4 than to have to dismantle the whole thing. The interaction in the game is more in the way of blocking and taking what someone else wants, but there are cards that affect other players, going from forceful exchange of bricks, to taxes in dire moments and, as I said, giving points to others.

The learning curve isn't a thing to worry: I played five times so far, losing the first two and winning the next three - and I'm not a fast learner (but it surely helped that I read the rules, and that Yucata don't let you do ilegal movements and the phases come with helpful orientation). Once you know the cards and the flow of the game, you will probably play to win from your second game or so.

The replay value seems to be high: the cards come in different order, and so do the bricks, and also the special comissions. This will change, somewhat, the decision-making (though it won't be hugely different - the way to score is the same: by placing bricks and from the cards, but how to take these points will vary).

Since all my plays came from Yucata, components are a non-issue.

So, all in all, [thing=75449][/thing] showed itself as a fine game, giving enough choices without being overwhelming or to lead to some dread AP. I can't really measure precisely the gameplay time, but from what I see, 60 minutes is right on the money - maybe even a little less with 3 players. A recommended game for those looking for a light-ish strategy game with some (but not much) interaction, in a reasonable playing time.

In terms of complexity and game length, Firenze could easily fall into the family strategy game category. But I can only recommend it to families who can handle quite a bit of "take that" nastiness. Players can suffer from severe setbacks triggered by the cards that other players select. And these cannot always be prevented by clever play, because each player's turn adds a new card that can be selected. The nature of the negative action cards is such, that they introduce a big push your luck element: If you do not "cash" your tower at the right moment, a nasty card could be played that turns it into rubble. All in all a solid euro offering with nice artwork and components and quite a bit of interaction. Not sure if it is better that Thurn & Taxis though.

Firenze is an obscure gem. Initially published by Pegasus and later reprinted by Pandasauraus, it remains relatively under the radar. With copies being rather limited, this game certainly deserve another chance in the spotlight. Tower building games aren't new but the sliding card track coupled with the tower block purchase mechanism feels fresh. There is certainly tension throughout the game coming from grabbing cards off the track. The distribution of the bricks and how they come out the bag is tighter and more consequential than I initially imagined and cannot be gleaned from reading the rules alone. It is important to pay attention to the types of bricks available on the track and in the bag to plan which towers to built lest you have to tear it down shortly after.

The small flaws in the game I could think of: too much card text. It seems some editing to make the text more concise would be helpful. 

Overall, Firenze is a short, tense and brilliant tower building game that deserves wider distribution. S

RATING: 4
Feels repetitive with no arc. I only played 2p and I believe this contributed to the lack of tension. 3p is probably the sweet spot since 4p is said to be too chaotic. But regardless, it's completely unthematic and it feels as if there's only one valid strategy.  Players go for the bigger points first which means building from the top down. I played this three times - tried to give the game a fair shake - and I was not only disappointed, but actually bored.

Steding is a designer I love on paper and still haven't tried in practice yet.

Regardless, any game about building towers has a three dimensional element that's appealing, so stick Steding mechanics in there, throw in a card-row and hey presto, it looks pretty good.

Firenze is a solid middleweight Euro.  I liked the race feel of the set collection and weighing the benefits/detriments of the cards vs the value of the tower pieces sitting on them.  However I found the constant moving of cards down the row and restocking tower bits after every short turn to feel excessively fiddly.  That combined with the last few turns causing what felt like some necessary but not particularly interesting AP while people were grubbing for every last possible point will probably keep this from ever being a real favorite for me.

J.A.S.E. (Just Another Standard Eurogame), which for us means it’s fun to play. Or as we use to say: “What’s wrong with standard?” In this game, you’ll have to built towers. To do that, you will have to collect building stones, that are placed onto cards on the main board. During a turn, a player can do the following:

    Draw a card (required) Each player, has to pick one of the cards on the board. First card is free. 2nd card costs one building stone. 3rd card costs 2 building stones. Etc. Paying is done, by placing one building stone, onto each card that is skipped. The building stones, that are placed on the chosen card, goes into the players stock. Depending on what kind of card it is, the card has to be fulfilled immediately, or can be saved for later times.
    Exchange building stone (optional) A player may exchange three of his building stones, with one of the stones, that are left on a card on the main board.
    Build tower (optional) A player can build as many towers of a color as he wants. All the stones in one tower has to be of the same color. Placing the first 2 building stones is free. Each stone that a player wants to build more, will cost him extra building stones.
    Breaking down towers (required) When a player started building a tower, but in his current turn, he didn’t continue with building the tower, the tower has to be broken down. The biggest half of building stones, goes back into the pouch with building stones. The rest of the building stones, goes back into the players stock.
    Complete assignments (optional) This is where the game is about. When a player has built (for example) a red tower of 6 floors, and the red tower, 6-floor spot on the main board is still available, then he can complete the assignment. He places one of his tokens on the corresponding spots on the main board, and he gets the points that the particular floor is showing.
    Check limits (required) At the end of his turn, a player may hold 10 building stones, and 5 cards. When he has more, it has to be discarded.

The game ends, when a players places his last token onto the main board. He gets 5 points. Cards that are in players hands are scored. Player with the most points win. Because players has to pay for the cards the skip during phase one (paying by placing stones onto the cards that are skipped), bad cards can become interesting. While there is nothing new in this game, this is still a fun game. Some interesting choices has to be made during the game, you can gamble every now and then, but don’t trust on luck during the game, because then you won’t make it. You’ll also have to look what’s left in the game, and do some calculations. Graphics are nice, and for a change, the theme fits the game, but Florence might be the wrong name. San Gimignano would have been better, because that town is known for his many towers. Florence has other great attractions to offer.

I think this is one of those cases whereby making things more complicated has caused the game to lose a lot. It's so much harder to lie when you have to constantly read what roles do. Fine if you're going to play a set several times in a row but then you need to have a balanced set which isn't always the case. Coup is simple to teach and still great fun and then is just hassle.

RATING: 5.5
This game is considerably better than Coup. Rebellion loses the convenient pocket-sized box, but it gains a huge deal of re-playability and interesting roles. This kinda solves some of the issues I had with the original game. Many of these roles are really cool and they combine very well together to build interesting interactions. This is the game that Coup should have been all along.

Yet I'm still not a big fan of social deduction games... they are just not my cup of tea. Therefore, while I enjoyed Rebellion better than standard Coup, I still don't enjoy this kind of "ethereal" game-play. I always find myself missing the structure of a real game and I'm never satisfied with the idea of building a game experience out of a conversation.

Overall Rebellion might be better than Coup, but it's still not for me.

Surprisingly, I see this as a streamlining of Dominion and The Resistance. It feels like good play is about working out how the roles interact (valuation) and then adjusting to how player choices skew what you might get away with.

I never had a chance to play the original, but knowing my preferences, I doubt I would have preferred it.

The original [i]Coup[/i] is an elegant bluffing game and some of that elegance is lost with Rebellion. There are too many card combinations which don't work that well and too many games that fall a bit flat. Although it's nice to have variation I just feel as though they would have been better off releasing a few of these as mini-expansions for [i]Coup: City State[/i].

Coup is still one of the best pure bluffing games I have ever played. Coup: Rebellion G54 is essentially the exact same game but with a splash of variety added to every play with various role cards.

I do recommend playing basic Coup first though. I've had some difficulty teaching this game to new players who have no experience with Coup just because there's no quick reference card they can glance at.

My preferred version of Coup. The variable roles are refreshing, and the entire feel of the game can be changed by swapping one role for a new one.

I found the Assassin-Contessa roles to be the least satisfying in the original, and I'm glad to say that the new 'attacking' roles are much much better. Most of these provide their own defence, or bring a decision to the game that is very interesting.

I enjoy the quick play. Games probably take around 20 minutes for a six player game. With the added roles, there is a lot of re-playability in the game. I think this is a lot of great gameplay for a reasonable price. In my experience, when it gets down to the last two players, usually someone has a combo established that makes the end a little anti-climactic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Basically just Coup, but with a random selection of characters at the beginning. You always pick the same number of characters from a set of classes to keep the game balance, and there's obviously a number of new character powers.

The upside is that this dramatically extends the life of Coup for people who don't like going over the same ground over and over again. The downside is that to keep the various character powers interacting, the game uses a number of kind-of-cumbersome keywords which occasionally means you miss an interaction until part-way through the game because someone forgets to use the right keyword.

This game is very similar to coup, however it lacks the simplicity of coup. There are 20 characters that you can play with, you might be thinking ALL RIGHT! However, the original coup has certain cards to block/stop certain cards, creating a awesome game mechanic. However in this game, you dont know what 5 out of the 20 cards will be drawn, so the same card counters its replica. General blocks general. Gurillia block Gurillia. Its boring.

I have mixed feelings about G54. You can basically play the original Coup with it (slight variation, admittedly), or play various other setups. I'm not as convinced that it's as balanced as Coup or Coup: Reformation as some card combinations result in "Well, there's nothing I can do" situations. The novelty is interesting, but the meta doesn't evolve as smoothly.

After a few playthroughs I have decided I am not a fan of this mechanic. It ruins one of the best things about Coup: quick play sessions with repeated competitions. Players who don't own the game are hurt by not knowing all 25 characters and their effective combinations. The own has a lot of memorization and customization that needs to be done to make enjoyable combinations. The description is right: it's a "gamer" version.

And yet I don't like.

Like Coup, it is a game that I enjoy because of the absurdity of the claims players make and how we let them get away with it.

However, unlike Coup, when it starts to become stale because everyone gets into certain patterns, you can change the mix of cards and break those patterns.

The main problem with the game is, I own far simpler games that give me that absurdity dynamic (notably Limits), having me wonder, why would I play this one instead?

Although Coup has a more elegant feel to it, this game's extra roles do allow for more exploration when the original game has been played to death. My complaints would be that this game's organization is difficult, adding to its setup time, and that the cards aren't as large nor do they have the linen finish that the original Coup game has. However, Coup: Rebellion G54 is a worthy addition to the Coup mechanics.

The roles in this game just don't work together as interestingly as in the original Coup. I can't quite pin down exactly what doesn't work about it (I'm thinking it's to be found in the lack of interaction between the roles and the fact that many abilities feel less vital to have), but all my plays of this have dragged on with relatively little bluffing and no real tension, in contrast to my many relatively exciting plays of the original.

I haven't played this, but I seriously thought about backing the Kickstarter.  I ultimately decided to stick with my original Coup + Reformation.  The reason is that I've observed that Coup gets better as players gain familiarity with the game.  I fear that constantly changing up the roles will make it harder to reach this level of play.  I also like the the asymmetric blocking interactions of Coup, which are necessarily absent in G54.

Coup is a good game but I have not played it nearly enough to have exhausted the potential of the base set. This set is a worthwhile acquisition if you have reached that stage, but probably unnecessary otherwise. Some of the interactions between the characters are also a little fuzzy and not immediately obvious as to how it should work.

The artwork on the Lamme Games original of Coup and Guatemala is wonderful. I do not know quite why AEG decided to ruin this fabulous artwork. I find the AEG artwork so awful I can barely play their version of the game.

Initial rating 9.0

Heaps of variety. Easy to play and teach. Great artwork.

Pretty much everything I liked about Coup, but somehow more options and less difficulty teaching.

Here is a complete list of the things that Coup G54 is worse than Coup original at:
-The Coup G54 box is bigger, so the game's not as portable
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Not recommended.  The idea behind C:R was to add complexity and replayability to Coup by increasing the amount of playable roles fivefold, and generating a random available five each game. This seemed promising, but in practice, was disorienting.

It's true that some board games can feel samey and used up after a while, but Coup wasn't one of those games. In trying to "fix" this unbroken part, Coup: Rebellion takes on the same chief problem that Munchkin suffers from: an identity crisis. It's still too arbitrary and chancey to be a rewarding strategy game, but now it's too involved to be a fun party game.

The lesson here is that games don't usually work when they try to be everything to all people, they work much more often when they pick one thing and commit to being a great game of that type. Coup is a linchpin in my board game collection, but Coup: Rebellion's identity crisis ends up making it not much fun in any environment.

I like how this builds on Coup to give many more possibilities - the caveat being that sometimes the card set-ups can be dull or broken. An example is a card that lets you take 3 coins but have to give one to another player. This creates temporary but very fragile alliances, adding a new level of drama and intrigue. You could approach this level of interest in original Coup, but had to work for it. With the right card combos, it emerges naturally in G54.

The more I play this, the more I wonder at who this game is aimed.  My group was almost ideal for this game.  We would play Coup 2 sessions everyday at work during breaks.  Rebellion gave us different cards to play with each week.  One week we decided to incorporate throwback Thursday and play original Coup, and we find ourselves not even playing Rebellion.  So, if we were "tailor-made" to play this game, and even we are tiring of it, who gets the most out of this game?  I would recommend vanilla Coup over this game to probably everyone.

This is a fantastic new version of Coup. It maintains the classic bluffing mechanism, with even more interaction than before, but now there are 25 different roles to choose from. This increases the replayability enormously, and I expect it to be around for a long time to come.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Coup, but with 25 roles, with a random mix of 5 different ones used each game.

See my pictorial review: https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1580526

The variability isn't as great as might first appear, and can create a learning curve each game (a player aid is essential, and a good FAQ would also be nice), which not everyone will like.  But hardcore Coup fans will likely enjoy how this mixes things up and adds new elements to the game.

Rules errata as noted [url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/21478344#21478344]here[/url]:
[q]When a player loses their last life:
1) the player is immediately eliminated, he may make no further claims or challenges and leaves his cards and money face up in front of him. 
2) Any actions in progress resolve and the dead man's estate may continue to receive or pay out money for the remainder of this turn.
3) At the end of the turn, after all actions are fully resolved, any remaining coins in front of him get returned to the Treasury[/q]

Adds more to the game but removes the quick and easy aspects of the original.

Improves upon the original, with more personalities &  and many more abilities. Much greater variety,  thus, much more replaceable.  The box is ridiculously large for the starting set. So of course it is begging for more expansions to fill it.

So far, this doesn't seem like an improvement over Coup, and Coup is pointless. But the randomized setup at least leaves the mild entertainment value of hoping that some new layout WILL fix the game's problems. It's like buying a lottery ticket, I guess.

I adore Coup. It has a soft spot for me cause it was one of the gateway games that got me back into gaming with my current gaming group and we played the mess out of the original which as any game will do became a tad stale. G54 takes the option of 5 cards and multiplies it by 5 for 25 total options of differing cards. You still only play with 5 but have options for differing combinations for games. It will take time for the group to grow accustom to 25 new roles so bluffing could take some time, but once the familiarity is there Coup fans will find this a hit.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
While more varied than its predecessor, the roles never interfere with other cards directly leading to a less cohesive experience.

This is a game where the "better" player figures out the winning strategy and wins, since there can't be an evolving meta.

This comment is for the Coup: Guatemala 1954 edition.

2015-03-02

Initial Rating: 8.5 (February 2015)

Coup is one of my favorite games and it is, perhaps, my favorite bluffing game. I have played it a lot and I’m not tired of it yet. Coup: Guatemala 1954 is basically the same Coup game, but it takes it to a higher level with more characters  and a variable set up adding lots of replayability to the game. 

This version takes a bit longer to play because the setup is a bit longer, but I think I will play it a lot in the near future.

The art is ok.

Bottom line, Coup: Guatemala 1954 is a must have for me. It adds lots of character to the mix and I can´t wait to play it again. I love it.

This comment is for the Coup: Rebellion edition.

2015-11-29

Initial Rating: 7.0 (November 2015)

I really like Coup so it is no wonder I also like this new edition of the game. The basic rules are very similar to Coup´s but now there are much more characters and variability to choose from. The replayability factor went through the roof.

The art of the cards is nice to look at. The theme is also cool but I don’t feel it through the game.

On the bad side, the games now take a bit longer than before. The reasons are: 1. A longer setup time because you change the available card pool often. 2. A longer learning curve because now there are much more cards´ powers to interiorize.

Bottom line, Coup is perhaps my favorite bluffing game. I won’t say no to a game of Coup. I have played it a lot and I still aren’t tired of it. For now I will keep in my game collection all Coup´s edition, but I feel Rebellion is the superior one.

Initial impression - the wide open mix-and-match nature of the game means that you give up the tight interlocked nature of the original base game. I enjoyed the blocking and the different ways that the base game roles interact with each other. Here you may or may not get that, and it feels weird.

An incredible stand alone expansion of Coup. Adds a Ton of replayability, with 25 new characters. The only reason this isn't a 10 is because the text on the randomizer cards is way too convoluted; there's an entire paragraph on each card, explaining that character's powers. They should have used the short and sweet text that is on each card. It makes rereading each available character type a real pain, and makes me mad enough to never play it again.

Took the subtle interplay between the roles of Coup and the simple rules and made it into a bit of a hodgepoge where the roles don't really interact with each other, and you can only block the exact duplicate.  I guess the fun is in the varied roles, but I missed the more classical feel of the original Coup.  But I can see why people might like the variety, but I don't really play games so often as to get bored with them, so I'm happy with the more repetitive play of basic Coup.

I'm not the biggest fan of Coup. I think it's okay for what it is, but I just don't find it that fun. I picked up G54 because I liked the idea of switching in and out roles to make for a different experience every game. Unfortunately, I don't think many of the roles are as interesting and well-balanced as those in the base game of Coup. If they could make both games compatible, I think it would be worth picking it up. Otherwise I think I'll just stick with regular Coup.

Save your time and just go play Coup. This game tries to add some variation to the game, but most cards only counter themselves since they couldn't plan around a super tight setup like in the original. I don't know what "blue" cannot just be blocked by "blue and yellow" (like in Coup) but that sort of thing has me turned off from this game quite a lot. Save your time. Play generic Coup

One of the most anticipated games that I waited for from KS. I loved Coup, and Reformation. This, however, didn't do it for me.

The game revolves around the types of cards that interact in particular ways. Making the game somewhat complex without adding anything else. The simplicity of the easy powers in Coup gave it its charm. Don't think this game would stick around too long when I need to trim games from my collection.

It's fun, but can be a bit complicated. The original Coup is easy to learn and plays fast, which I think is the draw. (I would definitely play the original first before delving into this one.) An interesting game, but definitely doesn't hit the table very often.

5 Plays - the bluffing unfortunately wasn't as interesting as I thought it might be. When it comes down to 2 players there's not much depth to the choices open to you. It's also very much a 'king-making' game where it's common for a third party to determine the winner just prior to being eliminated themselves.

Bought this but I have yet to play it. Again i probably shouldn't have bought it as it's rare I have a chance to take this game out to begin with. For some reason my game group isn't all that crazy about this game. I with they liked it more, because I love it. now the whole series sits on my shelf like a paperweight and I want to play it so badly.

RATING: 5.5
Very simple and quick game (it is exactly the same as Coup), although unlike one of their other games, The Resistance, there is very little discussion and it almost plays too quickly where you have very little to do. Simply take an action and if it does not correspond to one of the cards you have others can call your bluff. Whoever is wrong loses a character. Characters can also get assassinated or killed by coup. Whoever is last to stand wins. It is short and sometimes conversational, but overall just a quick filler of which there are much better ones.

I think one of the merits of Coup is simple and packs small. I can see the value in having lots of options with G54, but I think I would just prefer to play the original one.

Coup: GS4 Rebellion is a game that pretty much has the same exact mechanics as the original Coup, but adds in a wide variety of different roles.  A subset of those roles are chosen for each game, vaguely reminiscient of the pre-game setup of Dominion.  Of course, a problem because immediately evident--you need to know what all of the characters that are being used do, so that you can lie and say you're using them.  The game does come with cards for each character, but the text is very hard to see in the middle of the table, and if you inspect too closely that may give away your deceit.  This could be fixed with a good player aid, which isn't too hard to make, but is not provided.  In any case, if you're looking to inject more variety into Coup games, this is the game for you.  That isn't really something I was looking for.

Nice ideas but would need some fixes. Foremore an always-on-the-table action for drawing a role from the deck, and then discarding one (back to the size of your normal life pool). Also, lessened interaction between the roles worsens game.

Too much....it brings the simple Coup system into an unwieldy beast. With five different roles each time, it requires people to look at the single reference cards in the middle, potentially spoiling what the cards you have.

Think this is pretty bad. Base Coup is really good, so shouldn't this be better? Not at all. The balance between the cards can be pretty bad depending on the round. Some still are really good, and when that happens this game is quite fun. But many of the roles are just not very good, and some of the combinations can just be unfun to play. No reason to play this over Coup in my opinion.

Same as coup, just with a few dozen random characters instead of the standard and easy to remember five in base coup. It makes it more interesting for those that played Coup a million times, it just doesn't flow as well because everyone has to check and recheck what characters there are this round, and what they do.

RATING: 5
If you liked Coup, it's more Coup.
Bigger box, more roles, more rules to combat wonky edge-case issues, new art, same light 10 minute game.

I can't help but feel that this release actually detracts from the original.  It's still a silly filler game, but looses the romantically small box, and the new rules make it clunkier to teach and play.

Unfortunately, the bigger box is incompatible with original Coup, and does not include the most important element of coup: the faction cards from the reformation expansion.

Doesn't rise to the heights of Coup because the cards do not interact with each other in as many ways.  A card of one type tends to block another card of the same type.  While not as fun of an experience as Coup, it's still fun.

I have still yet to decide how I feel about this version of the game. It can be fun, but sometimes the card combinations can be weird.

This review is after one session and four games within that. Will update if my thoughts change.

Loved the original, stunning game.

The end game is critical in regular Coup. Navigating the regular cut and thrust, you then have to position yourself perfectly as you whittle down to three, then two players. In regular Coup it is rare you can't make a play. Sure if all the cards are known, they have a Duke, you have a Contessa all Captain are out all Ambassadors are out etc, then you are boned. But that is rare. You can always bluff something, try some craziness, or pretend it is craziness to draw the challenge, "Captain?? No way! That is too convenient."

With this version there were situations where you simply couldn't do anything but lose. There was no card available that would allow someone to catch up in coins. No ever present Assassin to topple a money rich Duke etc.

Some cards are funny, some are interesting, but the balance doesn't feel there. Maybe you have to be far more bold, maybe the cadence is different to regular Coup hence it is jarring. Cards don't have natural foils except themselves which changes the vibe up a lot. Treaties rail road a player. Protestor is useless as the number of players drops. Fruit seller is a beast at the end. Thematically cool, one on one, one card each lacking.

I am sure there will be combinations of cards that work really well. We will explore further because the name Coup is held in such high esteem and has earned the right to be given more of a run.

If you haven't played the original, play that first. If you have this is not a must buy as far as I can see but I will hold my copy because...it is made by the guy that made Coup.

Also we may be playing something wrong. There is always that chance.

Compared to coup, the roles are more complex and less consistently fun. Plus, it's harder to bluff when you don't have an intuitive grasp of what roles are available. I'd get Coup first, but if you've played it to death, this is a fun way to mix things up.

RATING: 8
Marvellous update of Coup to include 25 different roles, 5 of which are chosen randomly (with some restrictions, e.g. only one assassination card) for each game. The number of different roles makes the asymmetrical blocking of the original (e.g. Contessa blocks Assassin, Ambassador blocks Captain) infeasible, which as a practical matter also makes the game simpler to play -- roles which can be blocked are always blocked by the same role.

The magical part of the original is the evolving metagame, which is somewhat diminished here if different characters are used every game; players need to be familiar with the roles to be comfortable bluffing and strategizing. But you can always use the same set for many rounds in a row, and the different combinations do provide amazing variety. A game with Speculator will be very different if the Missionary (makes challenges much safer) is also in the set.

Perhaps the original is a more balanced combination, but the myriad possibilities here will keep it fresh for [i]years[/i]. Fantastic.

Similar to Coup, of course, but with more variation since there are a lot more roles. This also makes it more confusing. The Army is pretty annoying since it can kill ALL other players for only $5. So in a game with The Army, nobody can be allowed to have $5 - which isn't doable. This game will not be as balanced as Coup is. It is a complement to Coup, but I'd buy Coup first.

Much of the joy in Coup is in learning how to manipulate a very simple ruleset and the interesting results that spring from that. In C:G54 that is much harder, with the sets of cards changing frequently (or as frequently as players wish). That said, it is a marvellously clever design and holds together spectacularly well, but the interactions between the roles seems a little less exciting.

Fantastic game. I can't decide whether I like this game or regular "Coup" more. Unlike "Coup", "Coup: Rebellion G54" offers way more variety of characters. Some characters are really over powered, but that actually makes the game all the more fun, actually. Some, however, are not good at all and the game becomes sliiiightly duller.
Despite that, fantastic art and great gameplay (as expected from Indie Boards & Cards).

Coup (original) will always be way more elegant and approachable due to the simpler and yet more intertwined roles. G54 adds a ton of replayability at the cost of accessibility - each game requires reading a bunch of new rules and having a mini-FAQ on how interactions would play out between the roles. I've also noticed that when players don't feel confident with the roles yet they're much less likely to bluff - so most games of G54 so far are played very straight, not the most fun!

Basically the same game as Coup, but with more - much more. Instead of the fixed roles in the original, this has 25 different roles of which any 5(+2) are used each game - which is 53,130 different combinations, so you can play a different variant of the game every day for more than 145 years! Although, apparently, not all combinations work well there is still practically infinite variety and replayability.

If you play the original game a lot, especially with the same group, your play style may get a bit set and samey. Not so with this new version, where you need to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses and opportunities of each unique combination of roles.

If you do not like the original Coup, you are unlikely to like this, either. But if you like the original Coup, you will definitely like this and you will possibly never get tired of it.

Coup Rebellion is a great deduction game.  Each round is short and doesn't overstay its welcome.  The only downside is that if you misplay or misspeak you can be left in a very disadvantageous position.  It's not a very forgiving game in that respect.

This is a Star Wars re-themed version created by one of my friends and it looks absolutely amazing!

The revised version of the game adds a whole new dimension to what was already a very fun, light, bluffing/deduction game. Because no two games will generally ever be the same due to the roles that are chosen at the beginning, you don't end up having the same scripted start that the original game suffered from ("I'm the Duke"). The variability and interaction of the roles makes for some interesting possibilities as well.

Overall, I really enjoy the variety of the cards and how much it changes up the gameplay from the original. It's something that I look forward to playing again soon.

I absolutely love Coup!... this new version has 25 roles from which you choose 5 for each game... the variety of roles is great!... BUT, I like the original art way better and I like the original card size better...If this version used the original art style and card size, it be perfect...

This looks like a great step up from coup. Dominion style flexibility means the game will stay fresh

New roles add variety, but this game loses the accessibility of the original because of the extensive setup and more complex roles.

Need to play more really.. having all the extra characters makes it very expansive, which is great if you have a dedicated group to play with, but for me it's really hard not to just go to Coup Reformation which we all know & love

Compared to the original Coup, the added variety is good, but the increased complexity and chance for lousy combinations does not make up for it. Especially hard on new players, trying to remember what everything does and credibly bluff. For Coup fans who just want a little something to mix it up, raise the rating by 2.

[thing=131357][/thing]-clone, didn't add anything in my one try-out, other than slightly different roles.

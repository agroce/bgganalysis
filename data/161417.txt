Really liked this game, only played with me and my wife.  It was easy to learn, played very fast and had some tactical decisions.  I'm sure this one will come out again soon.

RATING: 7
Hand management on a micro scale. Solidly better at lower player counts, it becomes (in true Chudyk fashion) much more chaotic at higher counts. I like that it's modular; playing with your elderly parents or friends? Use just the basic rules. If you're playing with someone who likes super heavy games; play with the advanced rules plus the action rules. Mix and match that sort of stuff. We found it best (for us) to play with the advanced rules of canvas drawing and scoring to be the optimum point for forward planning and really emphasizing the hand management aspect. Arguably, one of my favorite filler-sized games. A solid 7 at 2p, maybe an 8.

OVERALL: Very luck-based with the base game. The advanced game is better, drawing cards for higher-numbered rules, but the game still feels dependent on how lucky your starting hand is.

After a couple of plays of the basic game, this is a very good and surprisingly thinky filler.  I'm interested in trying the advanced game now.

RATING: 7.5
Red by the crazy card guy Carl Chudyk. It sounds like Uno meets Fluxx - and how could that be any fun? But it is fun for sure - if a bit brain burny in the end.

The rules are easy - there are values from 1 to 7 in 7 different colors (49 cards total). 7's are high and 1's are low. If there's a tie, the color breaks the tie. So what's the trick here? Each color also corresponds to a 'rule' for winning the current hand. For example, highest card. Or highest set of the same value. Or a run. You get the idea. And in every case, the color is the tie breaker (Red being the best color of course). So at the end of your turn, you *must* be winning the hand - or you're out. You can play a card to your display (and this is what determines if you are winning) and/or a card to the discard pile - which changes the rules of winning. Very simple and genuinely fun. Certainly easy to explain - but it becomes a smart game of which card to play when. Last player in wins the hand - and scores the face value of all cards that were used to win (e.g. if it's most cards of a color, you score all the cards in your display of that color).

It's very fun at that level - but Carl didn't stop there. He added special actions for all the odd values - like swap cards with an opponent and discard cards, play twice, etc. I played only once this way and didn't like it as well - it took a fun easy game to a place I didn't want it to go. It became incredibly thinky - too much in my estimation.

During GenCon, I had Red in my pocket alot - and played I think 5 times. It's fast and certainly easy to explain. I like it alot. There were only 50 copies for sale each day and I believe it sold out as well.

Okay filler. Its best (only good?) feature is that it plays in about four minutes. I'm sure there's a similar game you could probably play with a regular deck of cards. The eldest daughter digs it like nobody's business, though, so it's a keeper.

RATING: 7
Proof that open source development isn't just for shitty browsers anymore. Red7 proves that you can ask the mob to polish a half built unplaytested game with potential into a real gem. I love Red7. The deck of cards are organized by suits and colors and the rule is simple. Be winning by the end of your turn by the rules that exist currently or that you changed them to with card play or you are eliminated for the round. Play is quick and the game is agile. Unlike other games with changing rules such as flux, this one is tempered, has a defined end, and affords you enough control over the outcome to enjoy yourself.

Pretty interesting gameplay.
Advanced version is more interesting in basic with the card-cycling mechanic.

Big element of luck in who gets the highest value card in their hand, since that allows you to win most of the tiebreakers, but it's alright because it's still all about making the best of the hand you get.

I played this game just three times, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

Red7 is one of the smartest designs I've played in a while, especially considering its small footprint. 

Even if, at first, it's quite hard to see all the nuances and little tactics that are important to win, the game is so fast that it's not a problem to play a couple of learning games. I really enjoy the puzzle that this game offers and the challenges of adapting to the evolution of the board state.

Red7 is a game I enjoyed a lot for a small card game, which is not one of my favorite genres anyway. It's not a game I would buy for myself, but it's definitively one that I would play every now and then.

1st play: Quick clever card game that rewards clever play while moving fast enough to stay fresh. Solid small box portable game. 

2nd play: When rated as quick, filler card game, Red7 does pretty well. Easy to explain, enough tactics to keep it interesting, and enough variety that players of different skill level can have a good time playing together.

Based on one play - it's kind of like Uno with special abilities. Okay, not really - but you're matching colors and numbers and at any given time there are multiple paths you can take but usually only one will win and the others will leave you screwed by the choices the other players make. So it's got some thinkiness to it, but this sort of card game just isn't my thing other than as an occasional light filler game.

RATING: 4
Update: Lowered rating based on one person I was talking with mentioning that it's entirely possible to be excluded from participating in the game, if the cards in your hand happen to never match what's in the middle of the table. That seems safe to put in the realm of broken, hence the sub-5 rating.

Only played it once and it left no impression in my brain. My faint recollection might be wrong, but I think the problems were that it had no flavor, that the decisions weren't very interesting, and ultimately you're just playing against whatever is in the center of the table, so it's a sort of multiplayer solitaire.

I'm sure it fills time well enough. But I'd prefer something with more to recommend it, if I wanted a filler.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Awesome at 2 players, because the ability to fold the hand whenever makes it much more an interesting game of skill with a little pushing your luck. With more than 2, you are completely at the mercy of the cards for the most part.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Silly little print-and-play game, plays well but is very unpredictable and scoring could use some work.  The game's gimmick - being able to change scoring conditions on a whim - is well-designed.

Downgraded rating 5->4: not a huge fan of the finalized changes.  Scoring still not good, and tableau restrictions just lead to more randomness/players eliminated faster.  Being able to play 2/draw 1 was a good mechanic, removal of that leads to generally less interesting decisions.

Typical Chudyk, deep game in a small box.

RATING: 3
Pretty much the only thing I like about Fluxx is the way that the rules morph in the course of the game.  I have long wished that a better game would do something with this.  Red7 does limit itself to giving players the ability to alter the victory conditions, but deserves half a cheer all the same.

Half a cheer is all it is getting because hand size, cards you have previously played and the actions of opponents so often combine to shrink your decision space down to negligible proportions: play this card to stay in the hand.  I am beginning to think that the name Chudyk on a box should be a big red warning flag for me.

Production quality is decent and the rules are clear.  Artwork?  What artwork?

When I started playing Red7, I thought it was OK. However, since I graduated to the expert rules (after bouncing back to regular several times), I'm convinced the expert variant is by far the preferred way to play. Rounds only take ten minutes, but there is so much planning, interaction and interesting decisions. Red7 takes a while to learn and not everyone will like the expert rules, but if you find a group that does, you have one of the best fillers available in your hands.

Lowered from 6 to 4. There isn't as much control in this as I would like. Maybe with 2 players. But with more, the scoring rules incentivize players to stay in the hand too long, resulting in high-scoring rounds and few chances to mitigate luck of the draw.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
More complicated than it seems.  This kind of felt like Flux, but done right?  Maybe I didn't teach it well, but others really seem to have a tough time grasping out the game worked.  I was a bit worried, and have heard it might not offer enough choices, but I had a couple of times where I setup some cool stuff, and felt like I had a tough decision.  Interested to try this one more and see how it goes, but as of right now, I am liking it!

Terrific card game, scales well with all player counts. I always play with the advanced rules, but haven't tried the optional "action" rules. Not sure the game even needs them, but I appreciate the designer throwing in some extra variations on how to play the game.

Small game category - awesome! Game has easy rules to learn but playing is not easy. Luck factor present :) You don't need big space to play it. 
Playing time (approx 5 min per round)

*Game has 3 levels of dificulty! First one is just kind of beginner warm-up, second one is in my opinion the best, third one is really challenging (game lasts longer, there is annoying downtime -> more rules, no fun at this level for me. But I can understand that some people can love it).

YOU SHOULD HAVE THIS ONE!

My filler/micro-game of 2014.  30+ plays in 6 months.  Played as a single-hand, the game is incredibly quick but gives you a bit of a "card game" feel.  Played as a multi-hand game, it has a lot more thinking but it may take a little longer than ideal for a game of this weight.  Love playing this with the kids because they win at least as often as I do.

I am very intrigued by Red7 and am looking forward to playing it more and with more people. So far I've only played it 2 player with my wife.

The basic game was too simple for me to want to play for any length of time...however after playing it twice it made adding in the icons much easier, so I definitely see the value in the basic game.

I loved it as a quick filler once we added the icons in!

As I play it more and with more people, I suspect my rating will go up?

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ A nice hand-management filler, where the concept may seem simple (you must be winning at the end of your turn), but it still offer a lot of agonizing choices during the game and fun moments.
++ Small table footprint and really portable game that can be played really almost anywhere.
++ Somewhat easy to teach, super fast to set-up and fast to play.


:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- A bit more luck driven than I like, even considering the new Advanced rules (play several hands until a player reach a certain number of points). But with more plays, it does feel more strategic (especially at 2-player) and less luck-driven than it first appear in the first few plays.
-- At 2-players, you have some control over the game and your potential points to score (it's thinky as players try to figure out the opponent), but at 4-players, it's more chaotic and unpredictable (so we have to take it more lightly).
-- Depending with who we are playing, the game can have some downtimes for a game that is not that long.
-- It's mostly an abstract where there is almost no theme (but at least they didn't tried to paste on a theme on it where we would have call the cards by the color anyway instead of whatever the theme would have state).
-- The rules are not complex, but they are really not ordinary so some people have a hard time "getting" this game (it take a few hands before it clicks).

A really neat, unique card game.  On your turn, you can play one or two cards.  One card can be added to your own tableau, and one can be used to change the current goal (most cards of one color, longest straight,  most even cards, etc).

The twist is that you must currently be beating all other players in the current goal after your turn.  If not, you lose.  Last players standing wins the hand!

Kind of a weird feeling game, but in a good way.  It feels like a family-style weight, but our games are silent with people concentrating on how to best play their hands!

RATING: 8
Best as a two player game with the advanced rules (but not the ultra advanced rules) as that way you can take advantage of the folding mechanic. 

Much like Poker, the key is to know when to hold 'em and know when to fold 'em. Only one of the two hands is a winner, the other is a folder. If you aren't folding, you better hope that you have the winner, or that your opponent folds.

Of course, to do that, you have to learn how to evaluate and play out a hand of cards, which can be a bit tricky.

However, if everyone plays each hand until they are forced out, the game just tends to go towards whomever draws the best cards. This is not special and I might as well play Crazy 8s instead.

This game has a really weird mental-hoops-to-jump-through to [i]actual[/i] strategy ratio. So much of your time is just spent parsing your hand. Once you're playing with all of the special rules and whatnot too, it's no longer the 10 minute game it purports itself to be, but more like a 45 minute affair which is maybe too much for something of this depth... but all of that said it's uniquely wacky enough to just be really engaging. I don't know what to say, I just dig it.

Need to play a few more times. 

First impression was that the game really asks you to look inward, and manage your own draw versus looking outward and trying to figure out the holdings of the other players and making plays to exploit their holdings. 

In other words, didn't seem like there was much interaction with the other players - just their tableaus. More plays or other variants may disconfirm that notion.

With the advanced rules, this becomes an entertaining puzzle.

I'm not sure how much strategy there is, and how much of it is determined by the cards you received (rather than how you played them).  It might help when people learn the game well enough to play it quickly, which is hindered by the complexity of the puzzle of just getting to play this turn...

One tactic I've learned is that if you don't like your odds of winning the round, in a two-player game at least you can withdraw in a timely manner to minimize your opponent's score.

This one really blew me away for such a quick filler there is a lot of thinking that goes into this especially if you play with the advanced rules that allow for additional card play. So much game play in 49 cards, I love it! Only concern is the game can really grind down if you are playing with the advanced rules and trying to find that one thing so you don't go out. We played this twice while setting up larger games, probably will always bring this to game days from now on.

I have played this game a zillion times. It's great with 2 3 or 4 players. 2 player game takes maybe 5 minutes, and typically we'll play it over and over again. I don't bother with any of the optional/advanced rules; they just seem to get in the way of what Red7 wants to be. This game is really probably a 9+ but I can't make myself give a 9 to something so simple and light!

RATING: 7
Great game.

I'm not really sure if comparisons to love letter are apt.  They are appropriate in the sense that it is an elimination game where you are bending the rules to your advantage, but love letter constrains you with a single option.

Red7, on the other hand, creates many more branches in the strategic game space by including hand management.  I now have the depleting option of which card to play, and I have to weigh what I think the other player may have left in their hand when doing so.  Although this is still a tactical game, you have control over more than the single turn of love letter.

Gets better with more plays, because you get to see the variety more readily and are more able to respond to changes in the game.

A simple and utterly pointless, but still quite pleasing cardgame. I really don't see how players can develop any measurable skill in this game: the hands are incredibly influential in how the game works out, so don't expect anything actually interesting to come out of the box. But in the basic rules the game is over very quickly (as there is no redraw) and there is something weirdly appealing in being able to still play a card and 'win' the game.

This little card game was most surprising in how clever it was and how much of a challenge it was to play. The concept feels fresh and unique. It's a filler I'm looking forward to playing a lot in the coming year.

In short - on your turn you have to make sure you're winning. To do that, you add to your tableau, or change the current rule for what constitutes a win. Ties become crucial, so number and color order matter a lot.

Highly recommended - arguably the best new card game of 2014!

Me he llevado una grata sorpresa con este juego! La premisa parece simple, pero cuando le añades TODAS las reglas opcionales, el juego tiene muchísima más miga de lo que parece! Sólo lo he probado a 2, pero me parece que funciona muy bien, el toma y daca es constante y se nota intenso hasta la última jugada. Con ganas de probarlo a más jugadores, pero no creo que cambien las sensaciones.
EDIT: A más jugadores funciona igual de bien que a 2, aunque el sistema de puntuación me parece bastante injusto. Mejor hacer que cada partida de 1 punto, porque conseguir una victoria épica en Violeta para llevarte 5 puntos es MUY decepcionante.
Arreglando esto, de los mejores juegos que he jugado con tan pocos componentes.

Very nice and think-y card game where your tableau needs to be winning after each card play or you're out. Each suit has its own win condition, and you can change the global win condition with the play of a card on your turn. Fluxx (which I hate) for thinkers.

[b]What I like:[/b] I really like the different levels that this game can be played at.  I can just as easily play the intro game with new players, and if needed take it to the next level(s).  I like the advanced game with 2 players, and really haven't delved into the latest version of the rules.

[b]What I dislike:[/b] that it doesn't hit the table more - it has a reputation in our circles as being to random.

Everything I want in a filler: quick turns, genuine decisions, and solid interaction without direct attacks or take-that cards.  Although it has player elimination, rounds are short enough that you don't care.

This game envolves a deck with a lot of different suits but the play is dictated by the draft in a very short hand, so there is almost no room for any planning.
Still the game demands a constant and fast adaptation of the thinking process, as each card played as the effect of changing the rules.
A very fast filler cardgame with some interest but definitely not my kind of game.

Outstanding filler. Fun decisions in a small package.  Easy to teach and quick at all player counts.  I always play with the advanced rules.

Pretty much an all luck fest that tricks you into thinking you have meaningful choices.

But still confusing enough to put off kids.

RATING: 8
Simple little card game, where players are trying to be the last one left standing in a round, scoring points for doing so.  Great little game - very easy to pick up and play.  You simply play a card and have to be "winning" the trick according to the current law on the table, or you drop out of the round.  If you can't play, you're out.  Last one standing scores points.  First to 30 wins.  I had to look twice at the designer, who usually trots out over-engineered card games that are very messy to play.  This is easily his best design - very clean and well developed.  Loved it.

RATING: 9
Great game. The game has a strong puzzle feel when trying to figure out your best sequence of cards to play. But, the randomness introduced by the cards other people play can really throw a wrench in your plans and adds a lot of chaos. You definitely needs some luck in this game, but the fun for me comes when you know you've played your last possible card, and you just have to sit back and hope that it was enough. I enjoy the tension of wondering how many more turns can I hold out. 

I've enjoyed many plays with just the basic rules, but the advanced rules add a lot more options and strategy. The iconography requires some getting used to, but it's manageable and well worth it.

RATING: 8
[thing=161417][/thing].  The rumours were that we were looking at a rival to Love Letter in the simple but addictive game stakes.  So I was rather disappointed with Red7.  It’s a neat game but I can’t help but think that there isn’t a lot of thinking to be done.  Not that I mind games without thinking, but if there aren’t many brain cells required it needs to be FUN.  I just don’t get that with Red7.  On any turn there is often only one or two moves you can make so there aren't many decisions, and the tie-breaker means whoever has Red 7 (or the top card on the table) seems to do very well.  So whilst I appreciate the cleverness of the game it wasn’t the game I was hoping it would be.  
I played with my wife, my 12 year old daughter and my 82 year old Mother and they really struggled with the unintuitive rules.  Whilst they are simple they are not so straightforward that everyone gets it instantly. 

REVISED:  Playing with the advanced rules (NOT: not the expanded game with the card actions but the advanced rules) this game opens up to be a masterful piece of engineering.  You can draw a card if you place into the middle with a card of a higher number than the number of cards in your display.  Brilliant!

The game is the perfect filler - a round here or a round there.  It is a real stayer.

Red7 is a game of numbers and suits that is not a trick-taker or climbing game. Normally these are up my alley (See Parade & Linko!), but this one didn't really do it for me. Maybe I didn't play it enough, but it felt like drawing 7's were too important, and whoever was able to draw more of them was better off. I tried both the basic and advanced rules and neither did it for me, though advanced was more enjoyable. I don't know if it's because I only tried it as a 2-player game, but that's just my experience with it. A lot of people do like this one, so definitely give it a go, if it interests you... it is a clever game, just not one for me.

Red7 has just enough rules to bog it down. The seven different rules are straight forward enough, but the base game gets old quick. Adding in a variant can spice it up, but when adding more than one the rules overhead becomes excessive for a game of this weight. Overall, its a bit too short for players to feel deserving of their victory or defeat, and the variants don't do enough to encourage continued play.

PnP #47

[b]Rating based on - 35+ plays, 2 player[/b]
Crafted on 24/1/16 A super fun card game where the object during the game is to be winning at the end of your turn by using multiuse cards. The game always starts with the rule 'you are playing red. highest card wins' so you either play cards to qualify for the winning rule or play cards to change the rule to something you qualify for eg. 'most cards below 4' or 'most of one number'. If you are the last person in that hand you take all the cards that qualify for the winning rule into your score pile. First to 40 points in a 2 player game wins! Been playing it since it was a PnP and I'm glad that a lot of others are finding love for it now that is commercially released in print and app forms. Lots to love here - simple rules, deep gameplay experience, tough decisions to be made – do you want to use a card to change the rules? or do you want to save that card for later to qualify to draw an extra card or for a big score?, excellent filler, easy to change the win conditions to factor in time (play to 30 points for a shorter game or 100 points or how many you want for a longer game), many advanced and optional rules so you can tweak it to your level of play (we do not play with the card powers though because we didn't feel it needed it yet), small footprint both in size and on the table so it's great for travel (planes, trains, camping etc.). The only negative is that the cards can be against you especially if you only play single hands, but if you play multiple rounds you tend to even out the luck of the draw.

Reverse Uno for smart people - can you be the last person playing a card?

See my pictorial review: https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1671771

A light, quick, and clever Chudyk card game where the colours and numbers of Uno meet the changing win conditions of Fluxx.  This is a clever filler for smart people.

Can be a starting player advantage?  If so, try this starting variant: [thread=1285290][/thread]

Tom Vasel said it best when he described Red7 as Uno for smart people!

Red7 also has a bit of a Fluxx vibe, but less random, in that you can use cards in your hand to create changing win conditions as well as play their values to be winning at the end of your turn.  There are seven different win conditions instead of the entire deck.

Once you overcome the initial hurdle and confusion of how to apply the rules and see if you're winning at the end of your turn this is a very pleasant game with more depth than your average light/filler card game.

A great reimplementation of some traditional card game concepts. Each new hand offers a unique puzzle to solve and the order in which you play the cards is extremely important.

Without them I feel that the choices become too obvious, and that 9 times out of 10 whoever has the high card for the match will end up winning the round.

A quite novel and interesting concept, but poorly executed. A sort of fluxx like game but for gamers although still simple enough to be family/non-gamer friendly.

You seem to have lots of options and decisions however this game is more a puzzle where you must change the rules according to what works with your hand, and the winner of the game is the last one to run out of options. This generally means the options are limited to what CAN I play rather than what should I play.

Entirely tactical as the whole game state changes with each played card this means there can be a lot of downtime as a player analyses his entire hand to find a way to survive another round

Incredible little game. Takes 5 minutes to teach, 5 minutes to play. Seems like it could be as popular as Euchre one day if boardgames ever become truly mainstream. The definitive non-team short card game, IMO (as opposed to Love Letter).

Szokás szerint nagyszerű alapötlet Chudyktól. Vagy szabályt módosítunk vagy kártyát rakunk ki vagy mindkettő. Egy a lényeg: az új felállásában nyerőnek kell lennünk.
Kicsit rejtvényfejtős érzésem volt elsőre, de lehet hogy csak azért mert elképzelhetetlennek tartom előre lehessen tervezni a játékban. De ott motoszkál bennem hogy lehet, hogy mégis lehet, emiatt nagyon játszhatnékom van már vele. :)

Red7 is a simple filler card game that doesn't seem quite so simple at first glance. You get used to the ever-changing rules after a couple of hands, though. I am not sure how much of the game is really under player control although it is obvious that it is fairly easy to play badly and shoot yourself in the foot. Not playing badly doesn't automatically result in higher scores, though. I'd say the strategy level is close to something like Love Letter. In any case, I've been enjoying myself so far.

Good filler game. Plays best with 3 or 4 players. With 2 players you have too many tie conditions and one player usually has the upper hand the entire round because of having, by luck of the draw, better tie breakers. It feels too random at 2 players, but just the right amount of random for a small filler game at 3 or 4 players.

Someone called this a gamer's card game and so far I agree.  It seems like a fairly simple card game, but there's a lot to it, and it probably isn't an entry-level game.  People get overwhelmed when I try to explain it.  It took me a bit to get my head around what a winning hand looked like, and some people just don't seem to get it at all as opposed to just struggling a bit at the start.

It was OK. The idea of changing the rule set is pretty cool, it sort of adds another dimension to the game. OTOH, it's still just a simple card game. The incremental addition of rules does nothing to inspire my confidence that the designer thinks he has designed a good game.

The game more plays you, than you actually play the game. Yeah, shure, you get many hands, and should learn when to stop the game to prevent the other player from achieving a lot of VPs, but... it just didn't click with me.

Very interesting game mechanic... but winning/losing ends up feeling random, based on what cards you're dealt. Everyone is making "smart" decisions, since not doing so means you lose at the end of your turn. So when everyone is making smart decisions, the winner just seems to be the last person to run out of options. 
The game can also grind along if you play more than one round. Lastly, the lack of strong theme and art is a turn-off for me.

A race to not be left behind. Basically, you are arranging your cards and playing them in such a way (order) so as to be the last man standing. It's not hard to learn, but it provides some interesting intuitive problem solving.

RATING: 8
A very clever game.  I'm not sure how much control you have in the basic version, but the advanced version adds complexity that dilutes the clean design of the basic version.  I wish there were cards that inverted the color and number ranking.  As it is, certain hands are better than others.  Card game - duh.  Excellent design.

Update - the person dealt the highest 7 is in too strong a position to care much about the game's outcome.  The scoring system is wonky, as a red victory condition gets you a max of 7 points.  A 'different colored cards' victory condition can put you over the top in one hand.  Same problem as Stichmeister.

Special powers solve these issues - try the full game before dissing it like I did.

Very simple and quick filler of numbers and colors. On your turn, you must play a card to beat the other players, either adding it to your play area or discarding it to change the winning condition. This is a clever idea, but the game is very light. Luck of the draw is obviously high, since higher numbers and certain colors are strictly better, and you have to work with whatever hand you are dealt at the start (at least in the basic game). There are some decisions, but, as you don't refill your hand, your options diminish as the game progress, and it often plays itself. It's harmless, it works, but I can't see a lot of replay value.

I can sort of understand why this game appeals to the masses, but I couldn't help feeling like it was a lot closer to something like Phase 10 than something like No Thanks. Good and simple games can be fun for gamers and also accessible to non-gamers as well. I'm not sure this really fits the bill though. It's got a lot of take-that, a bit too much complexity to really be elegant, and yet is very very random as well. It's more of a diversion than a competition.

Had to FAQ the tie-breaker rule. Husband and daughter kept arguing with me. Grammar wins! Very strategic. When to play a card to the palette and when to change the rule? Lots of hard decisions and thought and that was just the base game. Can't even imagine how hard the advanced rules must be!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Red7 is an incredibly simple 7 suite card game with legs: if on your turn you are not winning, you've lost. So on your turn you either add a card to your tableau to win with the current rule (e.g., most different colours, most of one number), change the rule by playing to the center, or do both! This brings Chudyk's usual chaos to the table with his simplest card game yet (if you don't card Flowerfall as a card game). It's a lot of fun and each round plays incredibly fast. 

The advanced game gives you reason to "fold" early (i.e., because the winner takes the cards which meet the winning condition) and makes each match about minimizing damage and/or aiming for a big payout.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Red 7 is Carl Chudyk's take on a game with fluctuating rules, one-upsmanship and social reading of players' intent, and a loosely scientific theme.

It's a fast-playing, quick-thinking game, where players have to balance cards on the table (and options for new sets) vs. cards in-hand (and options to change the rules, or just to hide one's intent).

Each color suit is ranked by visible wavelength, and is numbered from 1-7, and each suit represents a different rule.

At the end of a player's turn, either they are winning by the current rule, or they are out and must fold all their cards- win or go home.

It's a solid little game, that doesn't overstay it's welcome.

(03/04/2015) Comment based on three plays at one sitting.

Another frustrating game design where cards represent several things. Quick, toss-able, pointless filler.

As soon as I saw the font and graphics, this [i]looked[/i] and [i]smelled[/i] like Impulse, which is another design I detest. Within minutes of starting play, my blood started to boil. It is because...

I hate this game.

Sure enough, the designer was Carl Chudyk, the designer of Impulse and Innovation, both designs I dislike very much--his earlier design of Glory to Rome wasn't half bad, but I could never get into it. Strange and funny that I can tell who the designer is just with the feel of the play. I tried playing the game three times, and even won one. While there is an interesting card game here, I could not help but feel that the outcome is already determined by the initial deal of the hands. Otherwise, I judge that the designer is stuck in some rut where a card represents several things. It's a "5", as it is more straightforward (cleaner and leaner) than Innovation and Impulse, combined. That doesn't mean I necessarily like it.

So far have only played the standard version. That's exactly what I expected it would be. Highly tactical, very swingy (the game is swingy, by definition) and predetermined by the hand that is dealt to you. I really want to play the game with the advanced rules as well as the action rule. I think that mitigates the luck a tad more and makes it more interesting than just playing the cards you got.

Your starting hand of 7 cards is what you get (there is a way to draw cards, but it won't happen too much). Each round you need to tweak the game rule and/or build your tableau of face-up cards to stay in the game. Otherwise you are eliminated! Games are only a few minutes, so elimination doesn't feel awful.

I've extended the game out to 5 players and it still plays well. If someone needs to draw a card and the deck has been exhausted, usually by then some people have been eliminated, so I just shuffle their cards and form a new deck. [reasoning: if one of them weren't playing, we would still have had cards in the deck]

Great filler. Rather challenging! Sometimes you can be dealt a very bad hand and lose after one round, but must of the times it's so rewarding to make the best of the hand you got.

Preliminary thoughts:
Like most of Carl Chudyk's games, this seems really chaotic when you first start playing it. Having put some time in, it's still a bit messy, but there is a nice edge of forward planning in it. You're trying to develop a board that at any given time is winning in multiple categories. Hand evaluation is difficult, but not impossible, and there are rewards for coming up with an approach to how you should lay out your cards to maintain the best edge over your opponents. Make sure you have a backup plan though, as the other players can really screw you up if they have a set of cards you don't expect.

I've only played with the basic rules and points, but the next game I play will likely bring in all the advanced and action rules. I'm interested to see how it holds up to that many more options in a given hand.

I don't pull it out that often because in some ways it is a rules lawyer's dream.

But sometimes I can *be* that rules lawyer.

I enjoy it most played with the full set of rules.  That gives enough room for most people to have some options in how they play a given hand.

Really neat card game, kinda brain-burney -- and in that respect it's just like Chudyk’s other games -- but with one-tenth the rules overhead. Reminds me of Innovation in that I’m not sure how much control I really have, but either way my brain is working overtime (in a good way). 

We always play with the "advanced rules" (scoring over multiple rounds and an extra restriction on what you can discard), but not with the optional icons. The "basic game" is more a microgame, you just play one hand.

RATING: 7
A nice (if long) filler with fair amount of decisions although there is some randomness in it too.  
It surely feels more like an abstract card game of the German origin (there are tons of them) than the Chudyk's one, but it doesn't matter.  The game plays nicely and evokes emotions :)

I think I prefer the advanced variant (i.e. with abilities on cards 1,3,5,7).  I felt more control and the game seemed deeper.  But I need more plays to verify if it wasn't just an accident.

So far I've only tried it in the most basic version (no drawing more cards if you play high to the middle, ad no using the special actions of the odd numbered cards) and without those it's a nice fun card game reminiscent of some of my favorite traditional card games. It rides that line between being able to just play cards and socialize while still making you think pretty well. But I could see this rating going up if or when I try the full rules; I could see it becoming a bit more interesting of a game.

Carl, you've done it again! This one is very simple compared to his other titles, but that makes it even more elegant.  There is a lot of strategy, tension, and fun packed into such a small, cheap, and fast game. The changing rules is clever and the multiple uses of cards is in his awesome style.

RATING: 5
Red7 is an improvement over Fluxx, but unfortunately that doesn't say much. It is certainly a good alternative for those looking for a quick, light card game about modifying the game rules in order to win. Unlike Fluxx, it doesn't outstay its welcome and presents players with a bit of a puzzle each turn.

My main complaint is that, even when playing with advanced rule tweaks meant to balance the cards, much of the game comes down to one's starting hand, what cards are played by others, and (with advanced rules) what cards are drawn. In other words, all that puzzling out the best move can be for nothing.

There are other light card games that present interesting decisions that matter much more than they do in Red7. It may be a Fluxx killer, but it isn't the kind of game I'd necessarily suggest playing.

Interesting filler.  On your turn, you can play a card to the center to change the win condition or play a card in front of you to help meet the win condition.  Or both.  You must be winning at the end of your turn or you're out for the round.  If you're the last one standing, you score based on the cards that helped you win the round.  Score enough and you win the game.

Really solid card game.  Very tactical. Some people label it as "gamer's UNO", and I would definitely prefer this over UNO anyday.  I do like the "advanced" rules where you get another option to draw a card and play to a point value over multiple hands.   I didn't mind the optional rules, because they do make for more interesting decisions on your turn.

Initial Rating: 4.5 (November 2014)

So far, Red7 has been a very regular experience for me. By the rules, the game seems great, but in practice, it is very chaotic and (most of the time) luck defines the winner. The idea of changing the rules of the game sounded good, but I was bored by it because it is too random (like Fluxx).

It is weird that the most powerful color is the red one, as an engineer I think violet should be the most powerful one, it has a higher frequency and it has much more energy, perhaps the game designers guided themselves by the wave length?, but I digress, this is a very minor quibble for me.

A big quibble is that the Red 7 card is way too powerful, most of the time the player who had the card in his palette, won that round. Lots of uncontrollable luck with the initial cards. Low on decisions.

I think it is best as a 3 player game.

The rules can be explained under two minutes, perhaps it is a good family game. I will try it with the advanced rules soon. As it stands, I feel the game is way too light for my taste, but as it is a Chudyk game, I’m willing to give it more opportunities. I really want to like this game.

Current Rating: 4.5

RATING: 8
I can't say enough good things about this game.  It is very simple in many ways, but it has some complex decisions for a deck of cards!  This is a great 2-player battle!  Need to try with more players too.
We play with the advanced rules (scoring cards under the reference card, and drawing a card if you play a card on the canvas greater than the number of cards in your play area).  We tried the icons and didn't love it...maybe later when we know the game better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
After 16 plays I'm beginning to tire of this a little. Given there is limited opportunity to refresh your hand, being dealt a good hand seems to be the most important thing here.

Still fun to puzzle out what the best play is though, assuming you have a choice.

Seven seems an appropriate rating. :-) This is crafty game that is tricky to get right. You need to think out your entire hand so that you keep your options open as long as possible. It is easy to unintentionally close off your choices with a careless initial play. Not sure of the longevity with this one, but I think it will see a fair bit of action before it gets old. Cool stuff.

Somehow this game got popular everywhere else but completely stayed under the radar in Germany. It took a Polish publisher to release this game in German. Being authored by Carl Chudyk I was prepared to expect chaos and wild swings. Seeing the cards, my mood suffered and associations with Uno came up.

Is this worth exploring as its rating and rank on BGG indicates or is the supposed subtlety of play just an illusion? Is it worth thinking as much as the potential subtleties would require? Many questions that won't be answered for me as there are already too many quick filler games that definitely are worth playing but don't get played.

It took a few plays to warm up to this one, and to see this as something other than random. There are three ways to play. I like the middle one best, where you get to draw another card if you also play a card to the middle that is higher than the number of cards in your tableau. I always try to play with this rule, whether playing multiple rounds or just one and done. Like other Chudyk games, what seems random and chaotic turns out, with some experience, to be much more strategic. This is simpler than Innovation and Impulse and Glory to Rome, and players more quickly, and yet it feels like a Chudyk game. Recommended.

RATING: 9
Excellent 2-player game.  (I haven't tried more; I imagine they'd feel out of control.)  
I recommend you start right off with the "Advanced Rules."  That makes the game's thinkiness somewhat above most trick-taking games, for example.  Played 2-player, you have plenty of decisions and control, contrary to some comments.
Later, try adding the "Action Rules".  They make the game even thinkier, in a good way.

[PNP] This game feels random to me or I'm a bit stupid to play it well. You might have a strategy in mind but if someone plays cards that you don't expect then you are done. Maybe it is okay but I don't feel good if someone just drew a better color of a number and beats me not because they anticipated but because it suited their  plans. Might be okay for a quick filler but I am not a fan of this game.

Red 7 is a card driven game where during your turn you must be winning and that depends on the rule card in the middle. You might need to have the most of a color, the most different colors, the highest number, or the most of 1 number, etc. I enjoy the concept, but I find simply being dealt cards rather than some sort of drafting mechanic makes the game rather haphazard in skill.

The rules of Red are simple: Highest Card Wins!

But Red is just one of seven games you’ll be playing. If you’re not winning the current game at the end of your turn, you’re out! And the last person standing wins the round.

Red7's deck is 49 cards: each of the colors of the rainbow numbered 1 to 7. A hand takes just a couple minutes!

¡Me encanta este juego! Y mira que soy malo jugándolo... Lo llamaría imprescindible en cualquier colección, hay mucha diversión en esa baraja de cartas, y un reto en cada ronda. Situaciones infinitas y difíciles de resolver, no es el típico filler para echar unas risas (que también se echan), con este tienes que pensar, y mucho, para pasar a la siguiente ronda.

It's like if Love letter was actually a good game.
- 1 for the fact that you could get to your first turn without being able to play, which happens once in a while and is annoying. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Played once, 4p. I hated this game, but I understand it's appeal. It isn't completely random, but it feels like it very much. The only way to enjoy this game, imho, is to treat it like a trick taking/climbing game, with multiple hands for a single game. Very moderately better than Love Letter, and it serves almost the same purpose.

RATING: 5
Ultimately, I didn't find this one to be quite my cup of tea as my groups tended to take a bit long to play what is a short game.  

FIRST IMPRESSION:

It is IMPERATIVE that one realizes that you can both play a card to your palette AND discard a card to make this an interesting game.  I played a four player game where we did not realize this and the game was over without anyone staying alive so the last player won by default.  Don't make this mistake!  :-)

RATING: 7
It is hard to control what the opponents will do, but you can mostly plan a bit your sequence of cards (bar interactions from other players stealing cards from your palette).

Can be a bit frustrating, when you have no legal move on your second turn (happened in the basic game).

A very small game, mostly made of small "survival" turns where you need to win.

The advanced game is more interesting: there is more room for creativity (and for being saved from a difficult situation).

This is a clever, attractive little card game where the goal is to be winning at the end of your turn, or else you lose and are out. A round plays quickly, so the elimination is no big deal. 

We've only played the basic rules. The more advanced rules look like they add a lot of fuss but not necessarily more substance. The thing is, I'm not sure how much game there really is here. It's a filler, sure, but you really don't have much control over what happens, nor much ability to plan anything. And the advanced rules just seem to add more chaos, not more strategy. As a quick rain dance game it's fine, but lord, I'm not hurting for those.

Red 7 is one of my favorite small/portable games.  The rules are quite simple to learn (there's some tricks to figure out, but they're not difficult to understand), and it's only got cards as a component so can be played anywhere.  But despite the stripped-down nature, the mechanic of the constantly shifting winning conditions, combined with the fact that you can go out at any time, makes it suspenseful and gives it a really surprising depth of strategy.  

It's nicely designed, although very simple, and it fits in a pocket.  It's great for two players but works just as well with more, and a full game can be played in less than half an hour.  It's got a very standard premise that's predicated on figuring out the best order of play for your hand, but there's so many variables it always keeps you on your toes.

This little filler's mechanic of changing the winning condition of the game does so without being the chaotic mess that is Fluxx. Instead, it feels more like comboing card chains, or breaking up your opponent's. I'm sure there are hands that are more dominant than others, but this game is so short it's not a huge deal and you generally ca't e.g. get out before even your turn occurs like Love Letter. Also, having a "rules changing" mechanic that actually works makes this game feel innovative.

A unique trick taking game with seven colors from 1 to 7.  Each color has a unique winning condition and you must play cards at the end of your turn where you are winning.  

It also adds some advanced scoring and card options once you have played a few times.  I like to play it like Love Letter where 1 player has 4 or 5 wins. 

Very fun and very clever.

At first, this seems like yet another overly-simplistic filler card game.  After a few hands, though, I start to see that card play decisions do allow you to manage the luck considerably, especially with the advanced rules.  I'm interested to see how this game does with further play.

A good upgrade to Uno.  It may be a bit complicated to new players or non-gamers.  The use of key words "palette" and "canvas" can further complicate the game.  Without some of the optional rules the game falls a bit flat.  However, adding the advanced rules makes it a clear replacement for Uno.

A real brain-burner for such a quick game. The rules are devious and forming a strategy is difficult, but the challenge is part of the fun. Your outlook in the game may change completely when your turn comes back around as the winning conditions constantly change. It may take a game or two to grasp, but Red 7 is one of the deepest fillers available.

8.0 - Jul 2015 - 6 Plays:  A great filler game, and rated as such.  We haven't moved past the basic game yet, but I expect to soon.  This game pushes the buttons I like to have pushed, in filler form.  There are decisions to be made, and the obvious choice may not always be the right one.

RATING: 10
Those that claim the game is random or plays itself either don't get it or haven't played enough.  It does take some time to click, but when it does - have fun agonizing over what move to make each turn.  Usually there are multiple moves you could make each turn and you need to keep your hand large enough to not run out of cards by either drawing or trying to play only one card per turn.  We play advanced rules but without the optional rules.  There is tons going on without using the optional rules.  Each hand is very tense.  I have to say also that I experienced a first of any game I've ever played - my wife and daughter both asking to play before 10am on a weekend.  Wow!

I love filler games with a small footprint, low rules overhead, and good depth for their size, and Red7 fits the bill. It does a lot with just a deck of cards and a few rules.

Not really seeing a lot of depth here... In fact, often times once's move is forced (in base version anyhow), which means the outcome is mostly dictated by your hand rather than your decisions.

Personally I would play this a thousand times over Love Letter. Seasoned players can play this game just as quickly, yet it provides such a richer experience that Love Letter really fades in comparison. This is my go-to filler at the moment. It's easy to teach and only takes a few quick rounds to start understanding, but there are strategic possibilities that continue to open up with more plays. At the same time experienced players don't have an insurmountable advantage as the game is still fairly simple and luck of the draw is the great equalizer.

I think it's easy to come into this game expecting more, but for what it is and obviously intends to be it's great. A quick to play and grasp card game, a filler. I like this more than Love letter, by a hairs-width, and they occupy much of the same niche. I also appreciate the different levels you can play this game, I suspect the advanced rules without icons will be my primary go-to as the Icons seem fiddly and overly complicate the game - without you can to some extent plan out your hand, trying to aggressively force the other players to both play and discard or just trying to more passively play to all the possible rules so no color will screw you too much. Sure theres luck of the draw and it's chaotic and all that but it's good - play it over coffee as a pleasant activity!

Clever card game. Each card has a number (1-7) and a suite (7 colors). Each suite has a rank (compared to other colors) and a trait such as most of one number or most cards below 4 wins. When it's your turn you play a card down into your tableaux. You must have the highest hand (be winning) at the end of your turn or you're eliminated. Once all but one person has been eliminated, the winner of the hand scores and you play further rounds. Fun decision making.

This is a great, fast filler.  Like Love Letter, it has a "classic" game feel to it - as if it is a variation on a game you play with a standard set of poker cards. It's one of those gamer's games to play with non-gamers.  You can play the game in a light and random way, or you can really think about your hand and engage with the game pretty deeply.

Very nice. This little abstract card game is what Fluxx desperately tries to be:
Fun, fast-paced, cleverly designed, thinky and yet gives the players a decent amount of control over the ever-changing rules. The only sad thing is that it can be played in a maximum of four players; but mechanics-wise, that's understandable.

Medium weight filler card game that reminds me of a cross between Fluxx (without the chaos) and the suit dominance of classic trick taking games plus a bit of Uno. Its nice that it sets up and plays quickly and is very portable. Good for lunchtime games at work. May not be so good as a general family game as it does require a bit of thought, plus the downtime can pile up.

Red7 is a tricky little card game requiring card play that adheres to an ever-changing set of rules. Cards range in value from 1-7 and then a series of colours denote ranks, with some cards being more valuable than others.

Each round starts off with a rule (highest value from memory). Each player is then allowed to play a card to the rule pile in order to change the rule before playing a card to their stack. Cards feature a value, colour and a rule and it is the colour of a card that denotes the rule it contains. Thus the cards serve two possible purposes.

A player isn't allowed to play a card to their stack unless they can make a play that beats the current leader. Therefore sometimes it is crucial to change the rule in order to stay in the play. 

A round continues until only one player is left and they can take all cards in their stack that adhere to the final rule for the round. 

The winner is the first player to reach 35 points. 

Red7 is a really clever and fun game that is welcome at my table any day.

Simple and clever card game with several agonizing decisions. Do you play a card to your scoring palette or do you use it to change the victory condition? Do you play carefully to retain your ability to stay in the game or aggressively to kick the other players out of the game? Perhaps a bit luck driven but strategy does pay off in the long run.

Quick and can be fun. Having the red 7 from the opening hand can be extremely strong, winning all tie breaks, meaning less fun for those that don't have it. Often I felt that you can play the best action every time but whether you win depends on the hand you were dealt every time. Started to feel there is more luck in this than games that utilise a standard deck of 52 cards (i.e. ace to king). Would rather play 3 up.

RATING: 7
Red7 is a colorful, basically themeless, filler game with fast rounds that you can adjust the number of based on the time available or the interest of the players. Gameplay is similar to Fluxx except that the rules don't increase, they just change and the tension is higher as trying to stay in the game is not easy. Like Fluxx the rules are confusing as all hell to explain and its better to jump into a game than try to explain to new players.

During a game you look at the cards you've been dealt and try to plot a path to victory. Whenever someone plays a card or changes the rules in a way that would eliminate you, change the rules and re-plot your course. It feels like trying to drive to a destination where you lose if you ever come to a complete stop, so you always "Red light, turn right" until you run into a dead end. Last person still driving wins.

I could see my parents liking this.

A clever puzzle of a card game, but is it one in which what you are dealt matters more than how you play it, to a game-breaking degree? Having a certain set of cards (1-2-3-4 of same/different suit) seems to fulfill a great deal of the requirements. Luckily, it's fast.

[i]After a bunch of plays I really didn't want to play any more. The game has a clever set of rules, but they don't come together to make an especially exciting or tense game. I primarily played this with my wife, and considering the limited time we play games there was no way this was getting picked over any of the other card games we play together.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Quick card game that plays well 2p and more.
- Easy to teach, but really has some depth to it. You really need to plan out how you can play your hand of cards.
- 7 cards: That's it, you do not draw additional cards in this game.
- Simple artwork, but quite beautiful, with excellent graphic design.[/i]

A simple, abstract card game... Yet it is so up my alley! I love how you have to mix the tactical considerations (win at the end of your turn) with the longer term management of your assets (keep cards and options in your hand as long as possible). It is quite unique in its feel. Though the game is interesting as is, the options make it even crazier and mentally challenging. Yummy!

This is a pretty neat weighty filler, providing an important choice each turn on how to stay in the game not only now, but how to set up your tableau for a long term stay in the game. If you can't play a card to your tableau that makes you win under the current rule, you're out. If you can't change the rule to something that your tableau is winning, you're out. Or both if necessary. Good cards that work together and help you do both helps a lot, but it's a filler so it's enjoyable regardless. It's not a fun "cheer and groan" type filler, but interesting enough to get the mind juices working.

Based on one play: A very simple game where you must be winning at the end of your turn or you are out. You lay cards in front of you and objectives in the center. After you play you must be the one leading the current objective based on the cards in front of you. Such as "Have the most even cards" or "the most cards under 4." It is really short and a nice filler, only question is whether it will get boring over time.

A quick-playing game with number cards and always-changing goals/rules.  If you can't change the goal to something that puts you in the lead, then you're eliminated for the round.  I liked the development of round-to-round play, with cards getting eliminated from play, but I'm not sure how I feel about second place in a given round getting absolutely nothing.  In any case, good fun for a filler, a little unfortunate it only plays 4.

It's like Fluxx meets trick taking. I enjoy it with all player counts, but I think 4 is the best. I did run into the issue of when someone wins, they win period with that player count. Maybe something like 25 points might work better?

Still need to try the optional icon variant. But so far, I quite enjoy the advanced game.


Edit: They keep updating the rules. I like that the 4 player game is now 30 points, and you can optionally draw a card when you play to the middle. This might be more interesting. I'll play with the new rules for 2 players.

Nice filler of trying to not get eliminated based on the rank and card color powers.  Definitely had to overthink all possibilities to avoid elimination.

Seemed harder to plan ahead based on what others played, so it felt a little tactical in just avoiding elimination every round and not always able to setup for future rounds.

Red7 is a wild filler from Carl Chudyk. The rules are really simple: at the end of your turn, you must be winning or you’re out. On your turn, play a card to your tableau, or to the center. The latter will change the rule/win-condition. I guess you could call it Fluxx for gamers, but I think that does it a disservice. There is certainly strategy in looking at a hand and trying to play it out in the best way. I’m looking forward to the advanced rule set.

(5+ plays)  There is a lot of room for surprises in this game.  Also, it's fun that you are the leading winner after every one of your turns... at least until you lose!

I got to play this at my local meetup today. I don't care if the game is theme-less most of the time but this game without a theme is dry. I can see repeated plays will give me insight to the subtle strategies of this game but for the most part it is still a card game and a tactical one at that. I won't care for another game unless I really have to play it. About a third way through the game I was thinking to myself that I wish the game would be over already.

1 play.

---- Update ----
After thinking about this game more I can see why it didn't click for me.

1. This game is designed to be a gamer's filler. This makes the game a bit more complex than it should if it wants to be a card filler that will get played quickly. The game that I was in there are some AP moments that makes me wish this game should be over already. 

2. Pretty tactical game with luck of the draw. The winning condition is always changing so everyone has to pay attention and change their strategy accordingly. This does not enable "off turn thinking" because the end game condition changes with each player. This game is in it's own dilemma. Do I want to be a streamlined card filler or a think-y game that let players think on their off turns?

Conclusion: Still a 5 rated game for me. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Played 3 times so far. I think the base rules are too simple to be fun, but adding just a few of the advanced rules really makes this game pop. Even just adding "draw a card if you play a rule modifier card greater in value than your hand size" adds a great deal to this game because it allows a person to work toward a dominant strategy and play or (hope to) draw cards that will allow its completion whereas the base rules of "draw a hand - exhaust the hand - score - draw a new hand" leaves you at the whim of the draw. Red7 sort of feels like playing a game of Kigi or some kind of set collection game - its smooth and fast like that. It might go up in rating after more plays and trying more advanced rules. The rule book is too short and unspecific. Download the BGG fan-made rules.

Second game --- No need to read the rule page now since we can just read the short rule on the card like "A Run", "All Different Color", etc. Speed up our game, started to know what should we do in order to win. I think for playing each card, we should build up our color palette to make it stronger and stronger. What I mean is that to make your palette to dominate as more color rules as possible. That means no matter which rule other players will change, your palette will have a higher chance to win. At this moment, I feel it is a great light card game and is a must-buy. I eagerly want to introduce it to all of my game groups.

After 10 games --- Still find it is interesting and want to play it with all friends.

Played its advanced rule --- Finally played its advanced rule on its real product. Better than its basic rule. Will like to play more.

When I first read the rules I was a little bit just okay kinda a simple game.  But then when we actually played the game with the rules for the 3,5,7 cards it changed dramatically.  We did play until 35.  after a couple of hands I re-read the rules and found that the winning hand is supposed to be taken out of the game. That is going to make it even more complex.  Simple game but the more rules the better this game gets. Use the advanced rules!!

Really enjoyed this one. Reminds me of Uno or Skip-Bo but there is no take that or lose a turn, which annoy a lot of gamers, it's just "Can you put the best card out there?" If you can you are still in, if you can't you're out of the game.

It also plays quickly or they have advanced scoring rules if you want to do a longer series of rounds

Takes a few games to wrap your head around, but I REALLY like this one.  The game is really simplistic when you look at it, but it plays at a really high level.  Almost always play for points and use the draw a card when you play a new rule that is higher than your tableau.

RATING: 7.9
Tremendously clever game, considering it consists only of 49 cards. I have never encountered a game that can be played in around 10 minutes with as much strategic planning as this one. With such a limited selection of cards to play, and the increasingly difficult demand of being able to end your turn winning, the game pushes you to balance tactical decision-making in the moment just to survive the round with longer-term thinking in how best to manipulate other players into playing just what you need to work with the rest of your hand.

Fontos, hogy így vagy úgy, de mindig jobbnak kell lenni az előttünk levőnél. Ha máshogy nem megy, akkor a kezünkből kirakunk középre egy új színt, amiben mindenkinél jobbak vagyunk.

RATING: 4
This is a cute and quick card game with multi-use cards. The general idea is you get a small hand of cards, and like fluxx one of the uses of the cards is to redefine the win conditions. On your turn you must play a card for it's ability or change the win condition, but the important thing is if you aren't in a position to win the game at the end of your turn, you lose. You also lose if you run out of cards and have nothing to play on your turn. It's meant to be played in multiple times in a row, clearly. It's a cute idea, but luck of the draw is everything, and while you want it to feel like amazing move-countermove-countercountermove like what you might get in the 7th sea boarding combat system, or the initial D CCG racing system, or in Battlecon, what you wind up with is people looking at their hands and being disappointed at not having their moves play out.

RATING: 7.77
Okay, I'd probably just go ahead and give it an eight.  I like it quite a lot.  It is similar to You Suck (which is terrible and fiddly), but without all the ridiculous and unnecessary pre-game crap you have to slog through before you actually start playing.  
Red7 is simple, tactical fun full of "oooh's" and "awww's."  Excellent stuff from Carl Chudyk.  Now re-release Glory to Rome, you monster.

RATING: 8
Red is a simple and delightful little card game, with seven rainbow-coloured suits of 1-7, each colour corresponding to a different rule for determining the current 'winner'. Each turn you play a card, change the rule or do both, the only stipulation being that if you aren't winning by the end of your turn, you're eliminated. There's a little strategy (think Love Letter weight) and a lot of laughs; plus you can customise the experience by adding various options for more advanced play. It's gone down really well with everyone who I've introduced it to and should be a big hit when it gets a wider release.

It's ok as a quick filler, but there's not much to it. It's a bit fiddly for such a small game, with a lot of tie-breaker rules that you have to constantly keep in mind. It's basically a slightly more interesting version of Fluxx. I'd rather play another quick filler like No Thanks.

A unique little game with interesting card play. It reminds people of Uno because of the colored number cards, but it is a lot deeper.

There are occasions in this game where players can be eliminated very early in the round or feel like there is nothing they can do to compete. Also the scoring mechanism is very unbalanced as winning the round with certain combinations scores huge points and others score very little.

May 2015: Each round feels like a little puzzle. You have to figure out an optimal way to play out all your cards. I really like card games that have this feature.

However, there is no way to figure out what's in your opponents' hand, or any way to control your opponents' play to your advantage, so it's not as interactive or strategic as I would prefer.

I know this game is just a filler. I know it's not extremely deep. Something about the ability to change the rules to your advantage, dealing with the actions applied by specific numbers, and trying to figure out if you will be winning at the end of your turn, really works for me. My daughter and I have played this countless times and even carried it around with us on our trip to Chicago and played in some weird places. It's one of the few games that I have just as much fun whether I win or lose.

So either you are winning by the end of your turn, or you are out.  If you are not winning for the cards you have played, change the rule of determining who is winning to one of the seven options that will make you the player considered to be winning.  And... be the last person standing.  

A little luck dependent, sometimes you have no options. Hard to rate a game where you can be left helpless like that highly.

Played it like crazy when I bought it and now for some reason it gathers the dust, but I still think this is a very good filler. Note: play it ONLY with all the additional rules, the basic version feels too much on rails, you hardly make any important decisions.

The advanced version though... Sure, it's still random and you can be out of a round before you even start playing, but for a game as quick as this one it doesn't bother me much. It's fun, it's crazy, it still allows some clever play and it has the "one more time" syndrome. I also think it's too cheap to pass on it, but if you're a control freak and hate uncontrollable randomness in games - stay away.

Have only played as a 'one-round' game so far. A twisted game of ensuring you are currently 'winning' at the end of your turn or you are out. 
Play cards to your display to be winning with the current rule, or play a card to change the current rule so you are winning. Or both!
However, double-plays of cards will deplete your hand more quickly; if you're out of cards on your turn then you are out.

The card in the middle determines whose tableau is "winning"  Each turn you either play a card that will make your tableau winning, or you play a card to change the rule, or both.  If you can't do this, you are eliminated from the round.

Doing both actions (play a card and change the rule) isn't good because when you run out of cards to play, you also are eliminated from the round.

Good card game.

On your turn add a card to the set in front of your and/or play a card to change the rule governing which set is best. The result must be that you have the best set at the table, and play continues until all but one of the players cannot do this.
This is a very simple card game though the rules are a little mind-bending at first. I suspect there is some depth to it and it has the potential for a great filler.

Another interesting and unique card game from the ever-creative Asmadi Games - this is a light game which plays in only about 10 minutes, with mechanics which are easy to grasp. And yet it feels like every decision is important, and it is far from obvious what is best, as you try to give yourself more options for later despite an ever-diminishing handsize. It probably is largely luck-driven, although I've not yet played either of the "advanced" variants which I expect to lessen this. I have no doubt that there is significant skill to this game, which will allow good players to win much more often than weak ones.

Definitely a game which should be tried by anyone with an interest in "simple" card games. I can't say that I'm in love with it, but I think there's definitely more here than meets the eye.

This isn't "Uno for gamers" because Uno isn't even a game. Many cards use numbers and colors on cards - Red7 just happens to do something very unique with it.

The game is clever, but I'm not sure it's GOOD. It's certainly preferable to Fluxx, which is the closest game conceptually to which I can compare it.

I've yet to play with the full advanced ruleset. Doing so may change my assessment.

Excellent card game for any number of players (I think is magnificent for 2). The more we play it, the more we like it. It´s a very simple,  cheap, complex, and extremely addictive game. There're 3 games mode (Basic, Advanced, and Expert, which is the best one). Games on Basic and Advanced mode can be 5-15 minutes long; but in "Expert mode", with all the rules ON, can last around 30-60 minutes. There's luck involved, of course, but not so much. For me, this little-tactical card game is one of the best in its kind, you'll have to think a lot in your turn trying to make your best move-combo of cards, and it has been a great surprise which I'm enjoying a lot: I recommend it!!

A quick card game without a whole lot of decisions. Normally, I'm OK with games like this, even if it is mostly fluff. If the game is light and quick enough, it can be something to do with non-gamers to wind down the evening. However, I found this one to be a little too clunky to fit that niche.  The different rule changes and how ties are broken are just a little too complicated to be my go to light, quick card game. Also, I've seen players knocked out without playing a card at all and there are times when there really isn't a choice to be made at all.

I've only played with the simple rules and I think I prefer it that way.  A round or two of the simple game works well as a filler.

This one is just about quickly identifying your best path for victory given your hand and reassessing as the game state changes.

RATING: 7
James Cheung (euonia) cleared up my rules confusion very succinctly in plain language that should be included in any subsequent rules printing. Something like this:

[i] Follow these steps:

1. Count how many cards that fits the winning condition. (For example, most different colours, that's 4 cards for the both of you.)

2. If tied, find the single highest card among those that fits the winning condition. (For example, a 7 for the both of you.)

3. If tied, use the color to break the tie. [/i]

Basic rules are good for a round of learning and then hit the advanced rules for a gambling game - when to hold them and when to fold cheaply. Advanced rules really improves the game - more tension, more decisions, more strategic withdrawals. If you want to throw in a bit of chaos then the optional rules are just there waiting for you, but I prefer the greater control of the game without the optional rules. There's some sort of control, but it certainly helps to be dealt a good hand of higher numbers in varied colours. Still, the skill is in reading the hand you've been dealt and working out a path to hold out the longest with as many escape routes as you can. (It almost deserves a proper theme.) Because it's so quick I'm keen on playing more as a nice little filler.

One I should get to play with my wife, as a hand takes at most five minutes but there's some great crunchy decisions to make about how to play your cards. I've heard for years about Carl Chudyk as a designer, and this made me immediately get why he's so revered.

Red7 is very simple card game.  Each turn, players have to play one of 7 different numbers, in each of the colors of the rainbow, and each changing the rule of the game.  If you can't change the rule so that the hand in front of you is winning (i.e. most of one number, highest number, most even #'s), then you are out of the round!

Surprisingly clever little filler.  Like Love Letter it suffers from the fact that sometimes one will get a hand that is basically unplayable, but also like LL the rounds are generally over quickly enough for that not to matter.
The advanced version tweaks can make for some mind-melting calculations though.

A huge hit with my extended family. We stretched it to 5 players in the basic game with no additional draws. It takes about 5-10 minutes per round so it was a fast play with new players needing a brief 5 minute explanation of the rules and then teaching during the game. A fun game that is easy and quick, we like it as a filler.

My geekbuddies and bgg "comrades" are all crazy about Chudyk and after trying and trying with Innovations things finally became clear to me with Red7. Given this a light Chudyk's game I felt it was a high chance I would like it. 

Nope. 

For my taste Chudyk's designs are too gamey and literal. Each game is just a sum of its pieces, and sure it's a "wild" combination and there's randomness, but mainly it's about rules written on cards and interaction thereof. It's more about "oh what does this rule do with that rule" instread of "what can I do with this rule". It's just combinatorics and I don't care how funky it tries to be it never gets outside its confines and limited horizons. 

Back to Red7 - I heard it explained as "Fluxx done right". Which means: "Fluxx done gamey". And it is. What it isn't is a light filler game where I would get to look players in the face more than the cards they've laid down. Everything that happens in a game happens because of text on cards and this is just tedious. (instead of players driving the game)

Cute ever-evolving trick-taking game where players keep playing cards that change the rules in order to be the last one standing.

There's an order to suits and the ability to draw cards dependent on what you play. It's not much to look at (all Chudyk games seem to suffer from decidedly garish, busy graphic design), but plays quickly enough to be a painless filler.

When I looked at this originally, I thought 'this should be a simple game for all the family'... BUT hey, this can really turn into a real 'thinky' card game.

You really have to look at your hand, and try and work out a sequence to play your cards that you hope will keep you in the round long enough to win.

Wifey a big fan, and we like it as a 2 player battle off.

Really clever idea for a game. Feels like a classic euro card game where they'd put some bizarre theme on it. I've got to say that as goofy as a pasted on theme is, I frequently appreciate it more than straight abstracts.

Red is a quick and light card game.  There are 49 cards: seven colors 1-7.   Each color corresponds to a different rule for determining the current 'winner'. Each turn you may play a card to your tableau, discard to change the rule, or do both.  If you aren't winning by the end of your turn, you're out. There are also advanced rules, so that some of the cards also trigger an action when played, e.g. you MUST discard a card.

RATING: 6
There was no way I wasn't going to like this game. Carl Chudyk designed it, after all. The rules are incredibly simple, yet each round is fiendishly difficult to puzzle through. There's more to it than Love Letter or Khmer, but it's at about the same rules weight. I think it would make an excellent teaching tool for conditionals and logic generally. The only downside is that it's a little long for how luck-determined the result is, but I can't imagine playing without the advanced scoring and draw rules, otherwise you're entirely hostage to luck of the draw.

[url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/207536/item/4564754#item4564754]1 play of the published version[/url]

We decided to play the advanced/alternate variant where the odd cards have a special power. And also to play the points game, where you put the cards that won you the game into your score pile; first to 30 (4er) wins. Uh oh, this quick little closer might not be so quick! It took us 41 minutes just to finish 2 rounds! By then, it was time for me to go! Those odd-number card powers really slowed things down for me, having to look them up constantly. I won't be playing with them again, at least not until I've played a heck of a lot more of the base game!

Good game, in the single hand version or the points version.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a small card game that makes for a really decent filler.

It is almost Flux-ish in how it plays.  The game starts with each player having a hand of cards, one card in their "palette" (a tableu in front of them), and a rule card in the center of the table (called the canvas).  The cards are numbered 1-7 in 7 colors.  Each player in order takes a turn, they have a choice of 3 actions, and at the end of their turn they must be winning or they lose.  This continues until all but one player is eliminated.

The 3 actions you can do are either play a card to their palette, play a card to the canvas, or both.  The reason I say it is Flux-ish is that the game starts with the simple rule "highest card wins" but each color also represents a new winning condition so by playing a card to the canvas you also change the winning condition.

There isn't the deepest strategy to this game.  That's not to say there is none, there is some, you can set up future turns with what you have in your hand and build your palette in such a way that you can win with multiple rules and watch what your opponents are doing.  BUT there are also 7 different colors representing 7 different winning conditions.  Your hand of cards can only be so varied and a lot of luck of the draw comes into play.  Sometimes a player will win just because they have a better hand of cards, no matter how well the other players play.

There are also several different additional rules you can include in the game, like there are symbols on many cards that represent special actions you can take when putting them into your palette.  And it is also extremely accessible and speedy to play.  As a filler with a very small form factor this is a nice, pleasant distraction.

[-]Game flows in a more predictable fashion than Uno, which promotes skillful plays, as opposed to random plays, but it's still hardly more fun than Uno.[/-]

Gave the game a second chance. It's a lot more fun when you're playing by the actual rules, as opposed to having house rules randomly thrown in by the guy teaching you the game.

Update: The game just gets better with more plays. I can just play this thing all day.

At first glance, this seems like a somewhat clever idea that was made into a somewhat poorly-executed game.  I've only played twice (4 player games both times).  In both games, a player was dealt the "red 7" card, and in both games, that player ended up winning.  In checking out the game forums here on BGG after the fact, this doesn't seem to be an isolated problem.  I didn't enjoy the game enough to try any potential variants that address this issue.

Card game where you lose if, at the end of your turn, you are not winning. Each player has a tableau determining their performance against the current win condition, which can be changed by cards played to the centre of the table, e.g. from "highest card wins" to "most even numbers wins".

Card games with ever-changing rules are popular, but generally they're either far too chaotic (Fluxx) or not dynamic enough to seem much more than a regular card game (Cosmic Eidex). Red7 strikes a good balance.

[Asmadi Games 15 edition] {Abstract; beer&pretzel, filler; scalable} Red7 is another filler in my collection.  The fun is the ever changing goal condition (similar to Fluxx).

The balance of different goals is good.  This is hard to design.  Applause to the designer.

It's an excellent filler: easy to teach, easy to learn, easy to set up, travel, cheap, chaotic fun.  It also allows ambushes!

The minor thing is the English ... Hope it can be language neutral.

Variants:
++ Advanced Red7: This is a fun variant to make the game more meaty.  Good

= Action Rule: This adds take-that to the game.  It becomes chaotic fun.

there's not much tension and very little in the way of player interaction. It feels as if everyone is playing their own game and almost nothing you do will have any influence on the other players, except possibly the person to your left.

Innovative mechanics a plus; game starts to drag way too much with the advanced rules: a big minus..

This game was on my list only because [person=6001][/person]'s name was on the box, but [person=1086][/person] told me how it worked and I promptly got one of the last 10 copies on sale in Essen.

Whilst quite entertaining to play, most hands felt more like trying to stay alive rather than trying to actually win points and I'm not sure how much you're doing each hand than simply reacting and trying to stay in.

Perfectly fine, but not very memorable.

(Played with the advanced rules, but not the special card powers)

Update: The game is so much better with the special powers! Why have I only played with the powers now?! They completely offset the bonus of having a good draw. I doubt I'll play without them again.

Rating: 5 for the basic version, +1 for the card drawing rules, +1 for special powers, -1 for the advanced scoring which just makes the game outstay its welcome.

At 2p, it hits the sweet spot for card game: relatively simple rules, quick play, high replayability.

Not recommended at any other player count-- you lose control over how the decisions impact your opponent (most notably: you lose the power to fold in order to sacrifice short-term points for long-term gain). 

Genuinely don't understand why people choose to play this game without the advanced rules. It's light years better with the special actions.

Akárcsak a Fluxx-ban itt is folyton változik a győzelmi feltétel. Sőt, kell is folyton változtatni, mert ha nem tudod úgy alakítani a kirakott lapjaidat és a győzelmi feltételt, hogy te állj nyerésre a köröd végén, akkor kiesel.

A kártyák kétféleképpen használhatók: vagy magad elé raksz egyet, hogy erősítsd a tablódat, vagy középre dobsz egyet, ezzel felülírva az aktuális győzelmi feltételt.

Minden kártyának van tehát színe/száma és egy gyözelmi feltétel, és te döntöd el, hogy a szín/szám vagy a győzelmi feltétel részét használod.

7 color x 7 number 49 card deck. You have a hand and a tableau, a draw pile and a rule pile. The color of the top of the rule pile tells what rule is operative: highest card, highest card below 4, longest sequence, etc. You must win each time or be eliminated. You can play a card to your tableau and/or discard to the rule pile to change the rules. If you change the rules, you must still be winning at the end of your turn; if you change the rules using a card higher than the number of cards in your tableau, you can (and should) draw an additional card for your hand. When all but one are eliminated, the winner scores the number of tableau cards contributing to the win. Next round.

The end score seemed too high for the little I played, but that's easily fixed, of course.

RATING: 7
One of the better filler-length games I've played.  Playing a single round is fun, and the tension rises considerably as options diminish.  I prefer the more "advanced" rules which allow for scoring as well as the occasional draw.  I haven't tried the optional actions for odd-numbered cards, though I probably will at some point.  I'm concerned that it'll make the game a little too prone to AP and take away from the elegance, simplicity and speed.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A neat game. It's fun and kind of has the feel of a trick-taking game, but the rules can change on anyone's turn.

A couple of issues: it seems like getting the red 7 card can be a pretty big advantage. It will permanently give you the highest card in the game (meaning you'll always win if that rule gets selected). Also some of the rules are a little fiddly. There are different optional rules and an advanced game in the rulebook, so it might take some tinkering to figure out the best configuration. I prefer when games just give a single ruleset, especially a card game.

Rating could go either way depending on how the luck of the red 7 plays out, and which set of rules we settle on after more plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
For a game that only contains 49 cards, it has a lot of thought behind it. 

Every player on their turn must either satisfy the current game rule or change the rule so they are in the lead. You do this by playing/pick up a card or both.

Its a good filler game at the end of the night.

Allways on the lookout for games we can play on the plane or train or while waiting for food and this looks like a home run for those situations. Light, fast, but still gives your brain domething to chew on. Still have to add the icons. Plays well with more than 2, too, allthough ut gets a bit more unpredictable and of course then you have player elimination. But plays are fast, so you don't sit out for long. And this game is just great for the cafe or pub.

Neat little card game that fits a nice hole in my collection for a quick filler abstract card game. The game gets better with the actions as without them sometimes you feel like you just get a bad hand and no way to challenge but as its a 5-10 minute game who cares? just shuffle up and deal another hand.

Edit - After lots of plays we find our ourselves just playing the vanilla game without the advanced actions just because the game flows much better. However I think the advanced scoring (first to so many points) is a fun way to play.

Red7 is a super light filler game. You get a hand of cards which are in 7 color suits with values 1 to 7. On your turn you have to manipulate the environment such that you are currently winning or else you fold and go out.

You can play a card to your tableau, play a card to change the win condition, or play a card to both. Every color represents a different win condition (have the higher number card, have the most of one number, have the most even cards, have the most cards under a value of 4, have the most of a single color, have the most different colors, have the longest continuous sequence).

Ties are broken by highest number and then by color, where a "warmer" color beats a "cooler" color. When everyone else folds you win the hand. The card(s) that gave you the win go into your score pile.

We also played with a variant that when the card you play to change the rules is a value higher than the number of cards you have in your tableau, you draw a replacement card. And there's a "some cards have special powers" variant we didn't play.

The game has a lot of luck, but there's still elements of strategy. It's quick enough that the luck isn't really a problem. It was fun.

RATING: 3.5
Chudyk is a designer that I appreciated quite a lot: [thing=19857][/thing] is one of my favorite games; [thing=144239][/thing] is excellent; [thing=175199][/thing] is pretty good, even if derivative. But this isn't a relationship without problems: I had several issues with [thing=63888][/thing]. Still, the number of hits is higher than the duds, so I was quite excited with [thing=161417][/thing]. Alas, this was another disappointment.

Often, during play, I felt I was being played. Although I kept trying to prepare for later rounds, both using cards that would put me ahead in two or more conditions, and holding cards for conditions I could reach easier (or already was leading). Yet, things changed too fast, by one or two cards played, and the participants can't even count cards, as so many stay out of play, meaning it was basically impossible to properly antecipate what would come - and a good condition this round could turn into a dead end in the very next.

I consider myself a decent card player, specially trick-taking (which [thing=161417][/thing] isn't, but has a close feeling), being the number 1 players of Hearts in BGA for a little while. However, in [thing=161417][/thing] I just wasn't able to develop a proper play, effectivelly unable to play in a way that I needed a good amount of luck to actual pull something off. Therefore, I was constantly being lead by what usually was one or two proper choices, and was often frustrated, even with the short rounds. The luck aspect is even present in the scoring - one can win a round and get 3, 5, 7 points, while other can receive 15, 20, 25. This disparity is too big and can make even winning a round feel "empty'.

In the end, [thing=161417][/thing] is just an interesting idea (of playing a card and end the turn winning in the current condition, or be eliminated), but it didn't translated into a captivating game. Will definitely avoid [thing=161417][/thing] in the future and I don't recommend it.

RATING: 6
It took me a couple of plays to see the goodness in this game. Perhaps because I played single games without awarding points first and then when I played with points I did not play with the rules allowing you to take a new card when playing a card to the canvas that is higher than the amount of cards on your palette. Confusing rules for ties though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Less trick-taking and more puzzling. Every time you play you're adding to your own set of cards trying to be the best at... well, everything, but especially either the current rule or a new one you put down. With 7 different categories you may have to compete in, you can't prioritize everything, but it's a fun challenge to do so.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The great filler I was looking for.
But be warned: As simple as the concept is in theory, some non-gamers were put off by the complexity. It's awkward when you need to tell people: "Erm, no. This card doesn't make you win ... No, this one doesn't either ..."
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The decision between what to play to the palette and what to play to the canvas is interesting. 

The optional rules of additional action make the game more balanced as the highest numbered card (7s) are weakened and lowest cards (1s) are strengthened.

It is an appropriate game to bring along during travelling.

Red7 deserves the numerous accolades showered upon by gamers. It is an amazing and novel design packed within a deck of cards.  However, the game is not without flaws. 

First, the good stuff: Red7 plays quick each round. With the basic setup, players draw and play only 7 cards each hand. Even with the advanced rule set where new cards are occasionally drawn from the deck, each round really doesn't stretch out that much longer. Since scores are variable each round, I would expect somewhere between 4-8 rounds per complete game as players race toward achieving a victory point tally. The concept of Red7 is unique. Players lead each hand not by playing the best trick, but by leading the field based on the most current ruleset on the canvas. Players play cards to their individual display called palette or to the canvas to alter the ruleset. Failure to lead the field at the end of one's turn results in player elimination. Last man, woman or child standing wins the game. For a card game, Red7 is relatively cerebral. While there appears to be some tactics involved in positioning your cards for optimum play, card draw still rules the day. High cards will always be better but high cards alone without supporting cards to form the right suits to satisfy the ruleset is not useful (such as forming a sequence, collecting sets, etc.). So while the game feels complex and requires thought, at the end of the day, I am not sure if you have that much control over the outcome or can form decent strategies with such a short hand.

1st impressions: Fun little game. It gives me the same feeling as a trick-taking game, as you are trying to figure out the right sequence to play your cards in to maximise your chances of winning. There is a surprisingly steep learning curve here - new players will slow the game down a lot and it really takes a couple of hands to find your feet. However, once everyone is there the game moves nice and quick and does provide some opportunities to feel clever without making it obvious when you miss them. I don't think this is a game you will get oodles of playtime out of straight away, but I could see it sitting in a collection and slowly accumulating many plays over many years.

To steal a line from Aschere's review: it's like "Fluxx", if "Fluxx" were a good game. The concept is extremely simple: you have to win every time that it is your turn, otherwise you lose. To win, you can add cards to your tableau, or change the rules of the game. The basic game is good for learning the ropes, but it is the advanced game that really shines.

It's a short game with obtuse rules, but you already knew that since it's a Carl Chudyk game. Much like Glory to Rome or Innovation, each card does multiple things, so explaining the rules might be harder than you'd expect for a deck of 49 cards.

I won my one and only game, but I feel like the game took longer than it should have considering the weight. If I can reduce the amount of time it takes to teach and finish a game in 10 minutes or so, then I think my rating will go up. If it stays around 30 minutes with teaching, I think it'll probably be traded away or sold.

A good game that strikes a great balance between strategy and quickness.

OK, it took me three tries to locate this entry in the BGG database.  The designers might want to rethink their decision to go with 'Red7' (no space) rather than 'Red 7' (space ahoy!), since the word-of-mouth purchaser will never find this game online.

Anyway, Red7 is a decent timekiller that I played both in prototype and published form, and the final "advanced" version is probably the best.  Though players who are able to draw extra cards are at a hefty advantage and the scoring system is undercooked.

So... maybe I just convinced myself that the basic one-hand version is best.  Your call.

Probably plays best with 2 or 3.

Cool little game with surprising depth. A bit of luck but definitely rewards planning. Played ~5 times. Yet to try extra card powers.

A very innovative game, though unfortunately without a theme. Rules may be a little difficult to explain. Lots of player interaction as close observation of other players' palettes is needed at all times. There is also a small element of bluffing in the game.

Without the optional rules, the 7s are slightly overpowered due to the second tiebreak rule, so it is somewhat strange that they are optional. 

Knowing when to fold and when to keep pushing is key to doing well in the 2-player game. This becomes a lesser consideration with 3 or 4 players.

Game components quality is distinctly below average. The card stock is not good and the card size is about 1mm larger than the usual Standard card size, making them a challenge to sleeve. Not much artwork to talk about, though they contain splashes of attractive bright colour.

I don't hate Uno and this is a notch up in mechanical gamey-ness, so, it's a decent color/number card game with Fluxx-like winning conditions...

Red7 is a good filler when played with just the basic rules, but I love how easy it is to move on to the Advanced Rules, and teach them to someone after just one play of the basic game. The Action Rule, and Scoring combined make this an incredible card game, and a main course in itself. I'm incredibly smitten by this little gem of a game.

There's much more to this game than meets the eye. It's like a much, much better version of Fluxx.

RATING: 7
Kind of like streamlined Fluxx... the balance of trying to balance how you play your hand to maximize points while staying in the game long enough to win is interesting.  Seems like something that would be a solid addition to my fast filler rotation.

RATING: 6.5
Fun filler game where a hand can literally be played in less than 10 minutes. Think of a fun, more involved version of Phase 10 where you actually keep the cards you score if you play multiple hands.

A quick and fascinating game of rule-changing. The way it works can make a player feel like they have too little control, but I'm pretty sure that you often have more control than you realize. Yes, you must be careful to conserve your cards; however, strategic play of an "unnecessary" card when a rule change would suffice to keep you alive often sets you up to stay alive in later turns. You see what rules/cards you have in your hand, so do what you can to maximize your chances of future changes to those rules keeping you in charge.

P.S. As is extremely rarely the case with games — especially simple ones like this — the variants that add a little complexity do [b]not[/b] appeal to me (note: this excludes scoring and playing multiple rounds; that's fine). I'm glad they're included, but the mandatory effects of some of the odd cards' icons rub me the wrong way.

I think its an incredibly well designed low component card game that accomplishes everything it sets out to do.

Part of it feels like micro innovation, but on its own merits its simple, elegent, deep, and fun.  Almost the perfect game that i love in the same way i love and respect hanabi.  Well done guys.

Nagyon gyors, könnyed(nek tűnő), de azért agyalós játék. Ettől függetlenül ajánlható szinte mindenkinek, de a profibbak próbálkozhatnak a haladó szabályokkal is. Elsősorban sztem utazós vagy strandra való játék. A rendes árát nem tudom, PnP ez is, ennyit megért.

Świetna karcianka. Sprawdza się w każdej konfiguracji.
Jednak w pełni można ją docenić w wariancie ze wszystkimi zasadami. Polecam.

Quick, engaging, interesting card game for humans of all types (gamer or non-gamer). Fun without any advanced rules, but really shines with all rules. Couldn't recommend it highly enough, for 10 bucks, should be in every collection.
Just wish there were some official variants for > 4 players.

The optional icon powers could make this slow down more than its worth, so it might be better not to play with them (but play the advanced game, which allows drawing). Clever game, some short and long term planning.

As a game of grand tactical air-air and air-ground warfare WL Supremacy is unbeaten: top-rate components with a fully mounted mopboard, off-map battle sheet for overcrowded squares and a quality of unit and data card art Iâ€™ve rarely seen. WL Supremacy (alone or combined with WL Victories), is a mini encyclopaedia. Add to that 24 scenarios together with two free downloadable scenario supplements (as of writing) and one of the best rulebooks in the business, and the gameplay value here is serious; design your own is also encouraged.

Giving any other score than 10 would be injustice for this beautiful, clever and rich game. Must have for all aviation fans and ww2 wargamers.

Great game. I have played 4 times and getting the hand of it. This is not a single airplane to airplane combat game but squadron level. So far the games have lasted less than 2 hours. The mechanics are very innovative. Specially as airplanes can not keep fighting until they are shot out of the sky, as happens in many games. 
I did not rate it a 10 as I do not fully understand the reasons for some of the Maneuver and speed ratings.

One of my favorite series of games. This one adds the really cool stuff to the game; all the late war planes. Better scenarios than the first game

The concept of this game is very cool. I really enjoy the early maneuvering. One thing I don't care for is that you get stuck in combat piles. Weather or not you choose to dog fight, you can't leave a square with an enemy you've tallied. So, as far as I can tell, you can't strategically retreat, which really ruins the funnest part (that being the maneuvering). The combat itself is mostly just a procedure without choices, what matters is how you enter combat, and the existing state of your planes. So once you're stuck in combat it's just repeated, long, and almost choiceless procedure until you or your opponent breaks.

Very beautiful game.
The game consider many interesting elements of the airwar in WW2.
Fan of air War and pilot, I'm a little disappointed. 
The datas that differentiate aircraft are not precise enough. Aircraft of different values are then similar. (Example P-51) The art of pilots is precisely to take advantage of these small differences. (Eg the "hit and run" of the P-40 pilots against Zeke's, how to do it?)
During the game you have to make only few decisions... You are only a spectator of a beautiful dogfight regulated by dices.
For me, it's not the ultimate game to simulate the air war. But maybe it's impossible on a table.

Disappointed with the historical underrepresentation of British bombers, especially the Avro Lancaster - THE key British bomber in this period. However, I've discovered the additional late war ADC's which includes the mighty Lanc and many others:

[b]Wing Leader: Supremacy 1943-1945

An Innovative, Playable And Entertaining Tactical Game On Air Combat[/b]

An unusual side-view representation of tactical, or rather grand-tactical, WWII Air Combat. The graphical representation and components are outstanding. While the rules are lengthy with 48 pages, the game is not a complex one, its confusing nature more a consequence of its novelty/innovation. The system leaves you wondering at first how much decision making is actually involved, and this is the games greatest flaw, yet its most rewarding factor when pushing through. Ultimately, the decision making process is coequal with your experience. This has more of a chess-feeling to it than I would want to admit to myself, but at the same time I enjoy it for exactly this reason. Everything is a matter of positioning, gaining the point of vantage. When the squadrons enter combat, you cannot do much. This can be highly frustrating for newcomers, but is most rewarding for experienced players.

Great, but a bit fiddly system. It's a bit like GBoH of the airs (lots of small markers and small rules one tends to overlook).

RATING: 6
Don't let the forty-eight pages of rule daunt you. Once you figure them out, the game can flow rather smoothly. Be careful, in a multi-player setting, to take it step-by-step (sequence of play and then sequence of combat) carefully. Myself, I'm not much of an air war guy, but will play this as long as it's someone else's copy and he's talking me through it.

Still in discovery phase for this game. A lot going on and I hope that as we spend more time with the game it gets better. But learning it has been a chore.

Refinement of the first volume, this set has even more aircraft larger missions, bigger box, and mounted map. I really enjoy the system.

Excellent stand-alone expansion to an original and well-researched series.

Captures with simple rules the very complicated nature of tactical squadron-level aerial combat in its most critical dimension, altitude.

Excellent standalone expansion to an already terrific series.

Captures with simple mechanics and fun outcomes the complicated, vertical nature of mid-20th century aerial combat.

This is a really beautiful game. I liked the first volume very much, and I like the system, one of the few boardgame realizations of WW2 aerial fighting that 'feels' right. I have no doubt I'll love this game, too. Lots of yummy hardware...Mustangs vs Doras, etc...groovy.

The next game in the highly successful Wing Leader series, but this time focusing on the mid and late war periods with better aircraft.  The components are outstanding and you are given a wide range of scenarios that take place across the globe, ranging from fighter sweeps to massive bombing runs over Germany.  As with the first game my only concerns are how many times will this get to the table and the scenarios at times feel all the same.  Still, it is a very interesting system with little to complain about.

Wing Leader Supremacy is a big game. There's a ton of pieces in the box and it's your typical Lee Wood level complexity in a game. The squadron/flight board is a nice aid to reduce clutter on the map board. The platform style angle of the game is also pretty interesting. It's deep and very crunchy, and not quite for me.

First play was tense. I love the late war aircraft, and this offers everything from escort to CAP to bombing and strafing. Procedural but tense and a lot of game. Rating likely to go up with additional plays.

Wing Leader goes late-war. The side view looks weird for an air combat game but actually makes this a highly realistic battle simulation.

One of the greatest tactical games ever made. Beautiful to look at exciting to play. It helps to do just a bit of reading on air unit tactics in WW2 before play. Lots and lots of replay value.

This title, along with it's older brother [i]Victories[/i], handles air combat in the most unique way, a vertical map of altitude. That makes it a [b]10[/b] in design but the gameplay is a bit fiddly for my personal taste with a fair amount of counter shuffling and organization. But, with that said, the tactical puzzles presented here are wonderful to behold and I'd love to get deeper into both of these. For now, though, a solid [b]8[/b]!

Rounds out the set with late war aircraft.  Interesting sideways system of combat and movement that works.

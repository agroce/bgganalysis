RATING: 5
2 plays / 4 players

LIKE: Light tile-laying, with some competitiveness. Turns went quickly. We used the face-down random tiles which I enjoyed, felt like it added some variety. Interesting tempo to the game, especially when trying to secure a windmill tile. I also liked trying to set up next to an opponent that they may score my windmill for me.

DISLIKE: Large point spread late game. The scoring is a little fiddly, trying to see who has the three different types of tiles. Dry theme, but the windmill meeples make up for it.

OVERALL: Not a lot of tension in the game, it's mostly a game of maximizing points from the given board state each turn. I've played governor version and non-governor versions, governor version seemed a tad more interesting. Less players may be less chaotic.

Good looking fun, pretty standard placement-style Euro.  I like the rondel and the art and the relative quickness of it, plus the double sided board and advanced rules.  There's nothing terribly new or exceiting, but I'd say it was certainly better than the average chit-placing euro.

Great 2p for me and J. I'm curious to see if the rondel play holds up with more players, or if it just becomes a chaotic mess that precludes any sort of planning. Adding the Governors and Records provides some additional strategic depth without any added complexity.

Rules-wise, not at all a difficult game; but figuring out the appallingly-written rulebook is a challenge! And the choices for player colours were not well-considered: a bit challenging for the colour-blind.

The basic game is bad, but might be appealing to older kids. The advanced tactical game? Much, much better; but still, a tactical luck-fest, where seating order around the table plays a big part.

Theme-wise, a fair bit of effort has, indeed, been put in to theme Seeland; but still, any theme could have been pasted on.

Seeland is a straightforward tile-placer in which the objective is to surround your windmills with a variety of crops, monoculture being frowned upon in the 17th Century Netherlands.  Tiles are acquired from a rondel, with a price being paid to move further.  The way that is handled is the game's most original feature; players move their pieces along a chain of guilders.  Reach the head of the chain and you are stuck with taking the next, free tile until the player at the back of the chain moves forward. That does bring possibilities for the player at the back to keep opponents perpetually without a choice of tile, but since that involves accepting the same limitation it's seldom a good plan.  Players need to be wary of the game end, which can come surprisingly quickly when the tile supply runs out.

I have only played using the advanced rules, which add a bit of gamerly interest to what would otherwise be a pleasant family game.  Both the record harvest and the governors make this less a game of simply grabbing quick scores. The side of the board with a preset island distribution or a random distribution of island tiles turned face up at the start both reduce the luck element.  Seeland is a well-crafted design that makes me nostalgic for the pre-point salad days of eurogames.  All the same, I wonder how many plays I'll get out of it as strategic options appear limited. 

Production quality is fine while the artwork is appealing.  The English rules are well written.

Richard Ham strikes again! I had seen this online before but never thought anything of it. Building windmills? No thanks. But after watching Rahdo's Run Through we just had to try it. The board is 2-sided allowing you to play an easy version where you see what kinds of crops will be available to help you score. Or there's the other side where the crops are hidden so you aren't quite sure what you'll end up with. Then you have several different modules you can add to up the complexity. Those things combined give it great replayabilty. The graphic design is very well done and once you've finished a game you can see what you've made and feel a little proud.It makes you think without inducing AP for extended periods. This may be one of the best and most underrated Eurogames in the world.

The payment system/look ahead aspects of the game are very interesting, and in only our second game I felt like I was able to manipulate them to suit my needs. The game state becomes a little tighter and a lot more tense as the end nears. The ability to pull the plug and end the game is also a little evil (and I like that). Topping it off, the game is beautiful to look at. I wish the tiles were as chunky as the wooden windmills, though. Played only the tactical version of the game with the governors and the point markers.

I bought this thinking it was a gamer's game, suitable for two, when I was in vacation in Vipiteno. Then I read the rules and felt it was very light. Finally I played it: first with the starting rules, and it was slightly boring and disappointing (I'd gave it a 5 without variants); then I played with the suggested variants (Record Harvests and Bailiffs) and the gameplay was more exciting and challenging. Good game in the end.

Another Kramer title that I picked up on clearance and it is about what I expected.  A simple tile-acquisition game with some spatial management with where tiles are placed to maximize your points and minimize for your opponents.

After a two players game with all the advanced rules, the game stills being simple despite all the adds.

Perfect game with enough meat to please a gamer playing with his family.

I specially liked that in the begining you can think mills tiles are worthless and undesireable, but later when the lasdscape tiles start to cover the whole board  they're good to close an area immediately.

I want to play Seeland again soon and discover new possibilities.

*update*

I like the rondel, but there is some definitely screwage in this game... The player in last place decided to end it because they had no hope of winning, but this also kept the next player in 3rd place instead of finishing two mills and winning the game with 1 more action.

Perhaps it is better as a 2 player game?  But then the map would feel pretty open and it would just be a luck fest with the order of seeds and mills coming out.

Definitely play it with all the optional rules.  I think they make the game much more interesting as the choices are pretty blah without them.

After 3 plays, I enjoy it.  It's quick to teach and plays well with 2 and 3 players (haven't tried it with 4 yet).  It's generally an opportunistic scramble for points with some short term (2 - 3 turn) strategy.  Possibly it is more strategic with only 2, but it still feels like a game that is meant to be played relatively quickly without a whole lot of AP.

Great little tactical game, with a perfect blend of luck vs. tactics and a surprising bit of interaction between players. I really like the money track alongside the rondel, which makes the typically tricky decisions in other (Mac Gerdts) rondel games even trickier, since you need to "budget" for future actions. I also like the tactical blocking and space-snatching that goes on between players: it means you can't just do your own thing on one side of the board undisturbed. The pressure of the governor tokens makes for some tense moments as well. All in all, a very nice, light but still satisfyingly challenging game.

Updated 11/7/10.

This has become another quirky, idiosyncratic favorite.  

First, I strongly recommend the randomized tactical version (randomized islands turned face-up at the start) with Governors and Records.  It is the only form that I play. 

Second, for my full thoughts, please check out my comprehensive review: [thread=577318][/thread]

Here are a few key passages:

[Seeland] is a game that lacks a narrative arc, a game in which every small action feels a bit too much like biding your time, and where the opportunities to make a big advance are rare. And yet it is a game that seems to make more from less, and produces a better gaming experience for gamers than several titles with much more promise. 

Perhaps it does this by defying expectations at every level. The marketplace rondel and finance track seem almost backwards. And yet it produces an extortive choice environment that is engrossing and results in the only rondel encounter I’ve actually really enjoyed. The tile-placement restrictions seem to require isolation and multiplayer solitaire (those expecting [thing=3]Samurai[/thing] would initially be sorely disappointed). But the additional nuances – islands with large scoring opportunities, farms, and governors turn Seeland from a mediocre [i]tile-laying[/i] game to a crafty and cutthroat game about [i]mill positioning[/i] and domino effects. 

In feel, it’s a little (very little) like playing two-player [thing=42]Tigris & Euphrates[/thing]. Excellent play requires constant attention to the potential consequences of the placement of a single tile. The early two-player game, in particular, feels a bit like an arms race -- each player slowly building up the developed area such that it is always a single tile away from opening up a desirable location, hoping to outlast the other until something has to give. For a simple game, mastering the spatial possibilities of each turn provides quite a tense, interactive challenge that draws me in again and again.

Overall, I find Seeland quite well-crafted, quite challenging, and quite addictive. It may be my preferred 2-player short game (it certainly is at the moment). I find the game occupies a space in my collection most similar to [thing=39683]At the Gates of Loyang[/thing] (perhaps also apropos because both games are a few turns longer than needed). The difference is that while I always enjoy playing Loyang, I always [i]want[/i] to play Seeland. It's a simple, but not simplistic, game that requires a lot of thought, has the potential to generate a fair bit of tension, and can be played competitively by cutthroat gamers without feeling combative. It hits the right spots for me with its combination of clever design features, quality components, and rich tactical gameplay. I highly recommend it to anyone who is on the fence about it (but not to those who were never intrigued by the concept in the first place).

Wolfgang Kramer who makes a game about a province of my home country—that's gotta be worth checking out, right? So me and a few friends sat down during a convention and had the rules explained to us. It quickly turned out that this game was a sort-of area control game where the we would be surrounding windmills with plots of land; once a windmill is surrounded the player scores points equal to the value of what is around the windmill, if necessary augmented with a few bonuses. Selecting the tile to place occurs on a circular track which puts me in mind of Mac Gerdts' rondel. The first step you take with the general pointer is free; if you take more you also move your own pawn along a track of five coins. If you are at the front of that track you cannot take extra steps and have to wait until there are empty coins behind whoever is last on that coin track. This prevents players from taking too large steps.

This game is a family game pur sang. The mechanics are very simple, there is no direct conflict, and it is all friendly point gathering. I found the tendency of the tile / money track to devolve into a screw-your-left-neighbour-affair to be somewhat annoying. As such there really is little wrong with this game. It just is boring as hell for those who are used to more meat on the bones of a game. In addition the graphics of the game are not that good to play this game with, in my opinion. There is a unnecessary convention of front and back side of the tiles themselves to indicate 'seeds' or 'actual plants', and there isn't too much visual difference between them and the windmill tiles either. The result on the gameboard—which isn't even a complete fold-out, but rather a set of oversized puzzle pieces—looks in nothing like the province of Zeeland. 

In short: not a game I intend on playing again, but if you want something simple to play with everyone, this is a reasonable choice.

Components: Somewhat pleasing board, with its meandering swamps. Cool windmill pawns.

Experience: Fairly simple choices, but pleasant and amusing. There are a few opportunities to be mean to other players, but mostly I just advance to the best tile I can, and place it near my windmill, trying to maximize my turn with no thought toward what I'll be able to do on my next turn.

The governors and score milestones add some nuance, but not much. Feels a bit tacked on.

There is a measure of luck in Seeland, but just enough to keep it interesting.  Otherwise it's about putting yourself into the best situation you can and seeing how it turns out.

I did enjoy the wheel used to select tiles & the decisions on tile placement, but it would not be my pick for a high strategy game.  Good light fun...just not top of the list.

Seeland plays in the golden era of the Netherlands (17th century). In this time the province Seeland (Zeeland) gains ever more power, prosperity and significance. The object of the game is to expand and extract more land surface from the sea. Players live as a respected burgher in this time and take part in the land reclamation.

Definitely my kind of game. Pretty simple to teach, but can be a little of everything to everyone as the more luck-based landscape discovery version is what you teach for someone's first game, with the more tactical option on the reverse side being there for those so inclined. 

Worked *great* with three players and it's obvious that its good with two as well, but I doubt I'd want to play this with four.

Wow. Big, beautiful game. Unless you're a newbie, don't bother with the basic game... play the advanced version from the rulebook.

Should starting islands be facedown or face up, though? Face up means far less luck, but face down means a much faster pace (making it a short enough game that some luck is just fine). Both are best!

Lovely; seems complicated for a second, and then you realize just how seamlessly it flows.  A couple of interesting scoring mechanics (the 'governor' and 'record' modules) add a little depth, though the limited supply of governors makes them feel more of an afterthought.  The luck-averse may find this irritating, as a lot can hinge on what's under a set of mystery tiles, but if that's not a problem this is a game whose moderate length matches its moderate depth.  Not intense, but satisfying.

Players are farmers in Zeeland, reclaiming land from the marshes, and using it for agriculture.  Pleasant tile laying game where players move a common pawn around a rondel, choosing a tile from the path ahead.  Tiles are either windmills, or one of three types of agriculture (canola, tulips or cabbages).  Tiles are places onto a lovely game board, growing the play area and creating scoring opportunities.  They players are trying to position windmills in lucrative positions and surround them with high scoring agriculture tiles - windmills paying off when fully surrounded.  The hook here is diversity counts - if you're surrounded with only one type of crop, you score zero.  Fast playing, mildly thinky game of scoring opportunism - reminded me a lot of Africa and Carcassonne.  Very nicely produced, easy to teach, lots to like here.

There's a fair amount going on in this game, particularly if you play with the included governors and records variants, which I recommend.  I really like the double rondel, the rules for tile placement, and randomness (I almost always play with the face-down tiles).  The components are great.  The only downside is there is bit of mathiness that sometimes slows it down, especially towards the end.

Fun, elegant, with just a bit of brain burn. Rules complexity is quite low so it is family friendly. We definitely prefer the tactical board as it reduces the luck, but we haven't tried the governor and records variant yet.  Not sure if it's needed, this is quite competitive without them.

[Quality note:  I like the Ravensburger group - but (as with Castles of Burgundy) having thicker pieces would enhance game play.]  Also, like Castles, it's a solid hex tile placement game that warrants improved quality.  

Place to maximize points whilst also minimizing opponent's score.  Great with two (though only also played with 3).  Good rondel movement mechanic.  Play first sans governors then add to enhance scoring delta by adding another strategic dimension to gameplay.  

At less than $20 including shipping on amazon, this is a definite recommend to anyone who likes tile placement.

This is an excellent and beautiful tile placement area control game which works great with 2 players. It's not often that this sort of game works perfectly with 2 (or so I've heard) but I think the rondel is what controls this aspect. Do you want to grab the best tiles? Then you pay for it. Do you want to employ the 'hang back' strategy to control the market prices needed by the governor? Then you do so at your own peril and take the less optimal tiles. This is the first game we've had with a rondel so it was unique to us. We still find that it works in a novel way and the rondel is different enough from our new addition Finca.

I'd be really interested to see how this plays at its full complement of players. At 2, it can be quite strategic. I find that this game has replaced Tikal for me. While it was difficult enough at first, we have become more efficient at using up our action points to greater effect and it became quite same-y. This is a game that is very variable due to the game generated board and the way the crops come up at the market. You have to plan on the fly and that adds to the replayability for us. We like the luck based version more than the tactical version because it adds to the excitement but both versions are fine. We always play with Governors. We almost never play with Records. The other half (who is Dutch) loves it. A winner all round.

I bought this one based on Chally's awesome review (http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/577318/what-youre-missing-ad...). Kudos to him. I hadn't the opportunity to play it since i acquired it : what such a mistake ! Wow ! This game is a blast ! A very well designed and thought out game for family but not only because it has enough meat around bones to deserve gamers's attention.

The "double rondel" is an elegant design choice to implement money without combersome bits manipulation : it simulates the relative spent money between players in a very efficient manner, driven the latitude you have and conveying in a glance other players's the possibilities. Brillant.

This could end up our first choice for gaming.

Quality production with beautiful artwork. 

Gameplay is simple - move the buyer on the rondel (ala Vikings) to 'purchase' seeds or a windmill.  The first position is free but move more than one space and you'll need to pay for it.  But wait, there's no money in this game!  This is achieved via a virtual money track on the rondel which allows a player to move clockwise up to 5 positions (or coins).  Now here's the catch, if one or more players allways take the free space purchase, then they won't move on the money track.  It's only when there are free spaces behind the last player that the coins are re-positioned at the other end of the track, thereby allowing all players extra money.  It can quite easily end up that 3 of 4 players have all spent up, and one player is deliberately holding back releasing money.  In this case, these players are forced to purchase the free option each time!

The next action is to place either the seeds next to one of the players own windmills, or place a new windmill onto the board.  If a windmill is completely surrounded then it is scored.

There are other options which include picking up 'extra turn' counters, and the advanced (and advanced tactical) versions of the game really do add that extra layer required to keep the game interesting.

Seeland is a family-compatible tile placement game. It offers little in the way of long-term strategy but flows at a steady, pleasant pace of turn-by-turn tactical decisions. The game can be played as a friendly point gathering or a more competitive game where you try to extort money from your opponents or fence them in with unfavourable tiles.

In any case, however, using the advanced rules seems to be a prerequisite for anyone wishing for a little depth in their games.

I love the 3 ways you can play Seeland. You can use the base game as a teaching game, a game for non gamers, or a game with young children. Then you can use the more complicated variants for more strategic playing. The components of this game are beautiful and the two-sided puzzle board is ingenious. I like that there's difficult choices at both the market and when planting; you get to try and minimize your opponents points while maximizing yours in both phases of your turn. This game is fast, the gameplay is satisfying, and it scales perfectly between 2 and 4 players.

Reminds many of Vikings in that most of the drama happens on the rondel. However, there's also an area-of-control battle on the map after the rondel. This turf war reminds me of another Wolfgang Kramer title, Mexica. All of these games have beautiful boards depicting idealized locales. I haven't even played the full version with the governors, but I know already I like Seeland.

It's ok.  Smooth, easy to learn, easy to teach, but there's no real stress or tension involved and not a ton of opportunity for interaction.  It's pretty and straightforward and there's absolutely nothing wrong with it.  Except that it's a bit abstract and we'd prefer more theme and more strategic depth.  Turning the board over doesn't seem like it will add enough to make the puzzle interesting enough to keep it.  Might trade it away after a few more plays.

Alas, what has become of my favorite game designer, Herr Wolfgang Kramer? I fondly recall his masterpieces: Torres, El Grande, Tikal and Java. Lately, his releases have been average at best. Sadly, Seeland falls into that category. This is a fine family game, but doesn't contain anything that will capture the attention of dedicated gamers. Sigh. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Decent design with a nice take on the rondel mechanic. It is a very simple game, where each turn you acquire and place a tile that either allows one of your mills to come into play or adds to their value. The double-sided board provides two very different amounts of randomness, one with face-down tiles at setup, and the other with the tiles already printed. Both versions work well. It is a bit repetitive, with constant adding, but overall an enjoyable family game.

Seeland, like many other Kramer games, manages to produce a game that is largely tactical without falling into tactical tropes. By this, I mean tactical games that become a strict exercise in score optimization. Seeland is not that. Rather, it is a game in which you want to spend your turns pushing to control the pace of the game, slightly helping yourself out (but not so much that it is too attractive, or too helpful to the other players) or attempting to reduce other players scoring and scoring opportunities (the worse here is producing a null-score monoculture for an opponent). Overall, this game provides a fantastic rules-to-depth ratio, allows for creative play (especially due to its stuiver double play option), and is well produced to boot: two thumbs up from me.

This game is okay. It's long for what it is and takes up more space on the shelf and table than I was expecting for the price. The game is solid but mathy and pretty cutthroat. You want to starve your opponent money to limit their moves, set them up to fail on meeting goals (governor judging), and complete their areas prematurely. It reminds me a little bit of Carcassonne. I really like both of the included expansions although they do make for a runaway leader problem

Hmmm. Fundamentally a very simple game where you just want to take the high value tiles (they range in value from 0-7), with a 'hang back' mechanism that's supposedly a restraint although it's in no-one's interest to really make use of it. Not much on board interaction with 3 players, 4 would be an improvement, but not much overall to really recommend this.

My favorite tile laying game.  Interesting economic use of the Rondel that I have not seen else where.  The Rondel not only keeps track of your money, but establishes the governor's bonus objective.  Linking these two means you could spend money and at the same time either make it more difficult or easier to satisfy the governor.  You are encouraged to plant three different crops around your windmill.  You can place a windmill tile next to your opponents fields and share in the value of his crops: a sneaky tactical play that adds a lot to the game.  Being Dutch, this game has a special place in my heart.  My folks don't play games and the really enjoyed this.  Seeland may become my go to gateway game.

Rating for basic and advanced game so far. Enjoyable tile-laying game which can be played with casual gamers but still can be fun for regular gamers. Think of Finca or a light version of Hacienda without the cutthroat aspect coupled with a variation of the wheel mechanism from Vikings. I'm wondering if it is intended or a production glitch that the colour of the seeds coming up can be seen on the side of the tiles.

I love the rondel and how it is balanced with the money system. You carefully have to juggle your choices as to what tile to pick, what you want/have to live to your opponent(s). I also like the possibilites for extra scoring and how that gives you an extra layer of thinking in that at the moment when you make the decision to go for the extra scoring you are not sure if you get the extra points or actually lose five points.
Three player game has both pros and cons. There is more interaction but less tiles to pick, and I felt the game should last longer with three players, it ended too fast. I felt I still wanted to build and surround my beautiful looking mills.
(The puzzle board is not my favourite though, but the atrwork is nice, especially the tiles).

This game is easily dismissed by most gamers. Thanks to Ben McJunkin's excellent "What You're Missing" article I decided to give Seeland a try. Ben's right. If you play with certain rules, this is an excellent game with clean mechanics and many creative gameplay opportunities. Like most games that I enjoy, it left me thinking about how I could play differently, and better. 

The preferred rules means you play with (a) the records and governors rules as well as (b) the advanced tactical rules, but with a modification not in the rulebook. The modification is that you setup the game as described in the base rules with island tiles randomly distributed on the marked hexes. Then you flip the island over so they are face up. This is the [i]randomized[/i] tactical variant and this is where the game shines. It's not in the rulebook, but it is, apparently, an official designer approved variant. Designer approved or not, this is the way I play, and it's terrific. 

I've played with 2p and 3p. It is a bit more chaotic with 3p, though more interactive since another person wants to mess with your plans. I liked it a lot with 3p. I love it with 2p. I'd be willing to try it with 4p, but I don't feel a particular need.

I love the mechanic controlling spending. I like that there is no hug increase in point gathering at the end (stays fairly steady). The only change I would like to have seen was less saturated color on the board so that the board changed more as you add tiles.

Solid and elegant game...  Theme and mechanics flow smoothly and effortlessly.  Once you read the rules, you never really need to refer back to them.  It all makes sense.  Great as a family game, but it also offers nice tough choices for a more competitive play.  Board components are excellent, though the choice of colors renders the board a little messy and more difficult to play on.

Update:  After two 2-person games and one 3-person, I upgraded this to a 8.  Three players made it even better. Have yet to play the flip side of the board which offers less randomness.

Quite nice game here. I'm not a fan of rondel system, but here it works nicely. Artwork is horoble (too colorful) and it's getting even worse when the board is more crowded. Nothing new or special here, so no need to own this, but definitely ready to play Seeland again.

A pure gem of a game. the mechanisms used in the game are so beautifully designed that it makes the game simple to play. Some mechanisms can bloat rules this is the opposite. Also fun for 8 and up. Don't be put off by the dry theme it's actually a thematic euro that is simple to learn and has strategic depth.

I need to play it more to have a better-formed opinion on this game. It's obviously a game which you get better at with practice. Still for the first time it seemed I got only bad tiles left when it was my turn... I'm not sure what to think yet. (rating: 6.9)

RATING: 6
It's a tile-laying game with scoring as a timing element.  I suspect that 2 or 3-players is the sweet spot for this.   

I would disregard the most # of governors rule at end game scoring!  I completely disagree with the end game scoring bonus reward of 10 VPs.  Finding governors is purely a matter of luck, so why reward 10 extra points more for random luck?  Makes little sense b/c in most cases, if you find a governor, which is lucky, you will make the effort to finish that windmill above the minimum score requirement.  Without this rule, I would rate this a 7.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Only played the base game - it was fine but nothing that got me excited. The "loan" system was interesting and did slow people down at times - quite unique I must admit. Outside of that, it was standard family fare and played quickly and easily. Nothing too involved although decisions get a bit more tight towards the end of the game as you try to eke out last minute points before someone ends the game.

I wasn't sure about this one. It came out in 2010 but has the look and feel of an older Euro. It also seemed a little ho-hum and procedural at first. However, it's a surprisingly vicious game, giving you multiple ways to screw someone else over and tough decisions to make. There are some weirdo elements tacked on (the Governor business as well as the point-scoring record thingy) but they're not too intrusive.

RATING: 6
Initial Impressions after only one 2p game.  The game has some simple and elegant mechanics.  However, I personally did not enjoy it enough that I would ask to play it again.  1)  No catch-up mechanism.  This plays like an abstract/euro game, where the goal is to optimize one's scoring opportunities.  In this sense it is similar to Colosseum and other Kramer's games.  If one player takes a significant early lead, it becomes almost an exercise in futility to try and catch them.  Because the actions are simple and repetitive, playing catch-up is neither exciting nor instructive.  Also, this is very much a number crunching game disguised by the colorful looks and light appearance.  Ultimately you are scoring numbers and tile sets, with some timing issues and some luck.

A scoring system a bit reminiscent of Samurai coupled to a pleasant and reasonably original turn order mechanism adds up to a game that I would gladly play again if somebody really, really wanted to. I can’t think of who that somebody would be, though, because like oh so many games in the current glut, Zeeland is neither a groundbreaking game nor noticably better than its predecessors at treading the well-worn ground of the mid-weight victory point race.

It doesn’t take a lot of divinatory powers to state that Zeeland will be gone and forgotten when Nürnberg 2011 comes around, since it is one example of the countless - perfectly fine, but also perfectly superfluous - games that arrive in their hundreds every year, making me question the marketing wisdom of the boardgaming world.

6-30-14-Played this a couple of weeks ago with 3p and it's much better, I think, than with 2p.  That market rondel is genius with the money tied into it.

6-22-14-Miles and I played this through this week, made some goofs and muddled our way, but still had fun.  I brushed up by re-watching Rahdo's run-through again and then broke it out for my game group today.  It was so much fun!  (Actually only 3 of us).  I am thinking this is going to be a new obsession...when you think of how little you do on a turn--essentially choosing one tile and placing it---wow! So much going on!  :)  It will be really quick for just me and Miles and even with my A/P prone game group, it won't be too bad.  Looking forward to really getting familiar with this game.

Single two-player game using the random tactical variant with governors and records. Game played nicely, but would be slightly better with three. Yes, it would become even more tactical, but the fight over records and governors would be more intriguing and the map wouldn't feel too large. Four players would be tactical to the point that you cannot plan a single move ahead.

10/16/10 Played a four-player game using the most basic rule set. I thought Seeland was OK. It looks nice, and the theme is different (creating polders in the Netherlands). I have no idea what the advanced game(s) adds. I rated it a "5" for now. That might rise if I play one of the other versions of the game that I think adds more "umpf" to the mix.

I like this one a lot, and I took to the game very quickly and easily. I generally do very well without a lot of difficulty, and I usually win this one - enough that the game has become frustrating for my wife.

Nous sommes des marchand hollandais. Nous désirons acquérir les meilleures semences de tulipes, de colza et de chou d'un marché commun à tous les joueurs, puis de les planter le plus judicieusement dans un champ, lui-aussi commun à tous. L'acquisition d'une tuile, en première phase du tour, se fait de façon très originale, tout en créant une tension transversale et constante entre les joueurs durant l'ensemble de la partie. La pose de la tuile acquise doit, quant à elle, viser à optimiser sa récolte, et à nuire à celle des adversaires. Intéressant, et pas trop compliqué.

L'une des considérations stratégiques s'articule autour de la notion de tempo: Précipiter l'acquisition des meilleures tuiles a un prix: celui de voir son potentiel d'achat futur entre les mains de ses adversaires! Toutefois, prendre son temps peut rendre accessible aux adversaires les meilleures tuiles! Encore là, la solution peut être encore plus drastique: perdre un tour complet, et trois points de victoire, avec pour seul but de rétablir son pouvoir d'achat.

L'autre considération stratégique implique aussi l'aspect spatial: Bâtir nos moulins et planter nos semences afin de récolter rapidement de petites récoltes, ou alors afin de récolter lentement de plus grandes récoltes? Une troisième option, elle aussi axée sur le tempo, est de s'étendre vers des contrées non cultivables, donc non rentables dans l'immédiat, mais qui nous permettent de rejouer un deuxième tour, tout de suite, laissant nos adversaires impuissants et pantois!

Autre élément spatio-temporel et transversal: les prévôts. S'ils sont positionnés dans la zone des champs, c'est toutefois vers la zone du marché qu'ils portent leur attention. Ainsi, les deux zones du plateau de jeu sont intimement et réciproquement reliées entre elles.

Par ailleurs, advenant que ces prévôts soient insatisfaits, ils s'en iront terrasser le plus près voisin, peut-être soi-même encore! À cet égard, est-il prudent de construire trop de moulins près les uns des autres?...

***

Le jeu n'a pas un très haut "ranking", mais probablement parce qu'il est trop évalué en fonction d'un jeu à 3 ou 4 joueurs. C'est à 2 joueurs qu'il semble être optimal. Il est vrai qu'il se dégage de Seeland une ambiance peut-être un peu trop "calculatoire", et aussi une impression qu'il manque peut-être d'une petite touche de complexité supplémentaire. Amalgamées, on peut en conclure que Seeland n'a pas été parfaitement testé et n'est pas complètement finalisé. 

Malgré tout, mon appréciation générale du jeu est positive. Si je devais choisir de ne garder que le tiers de mes jeux de société, je garderais Seeland. Il possède une mécanique d'acquisition très intéressante et originale. Il y a une assez grande interaction et tension entre les joueurs durant les deux phases de chaque tour. De plus, le temps d'attente entre deux tours est très court. Le joueur passif peut profiter du temps d'attente pour analyser et compléter certains calculs. La lecture du jeu se fait bien, il n'y a pas tant d'éléments à considérer, et le matériel est agréable à regarder et à utiliser.

Nice tile placement game, with a relatively short duration.

It's not great because:
-> Quite random: the tiles you get and otgher players actions have much influence. This is not neccesarily bad, but I like games with those features to have a shorter duration.
-> Not strategic: very tactic, no long term planning.
-> AP: too much considering its light tactic component.

As a side note, governors are a great addition, but giving 10 points (advanced rules) to the player with more governors seems redundant to me: players are already getting 5 points per governor, and you have almost no control at all of the governors you can get. This add to the randomness.

And about the Strategic game, I have not played it, but it doesn't seem interesting to me. The isles is the only element that creates tension (will I get a Governor, maybe the plantation tile I need?) and removing it is not a good idea. Also, even if it's luck, it's more similar to a "push your luck element", sometniong more desirable that just "pure randomn luck".

So, a game I would not refuse to play, but I would never suggest.

RATING: 5
First impression (3 players): At start of the game it felt nice but in the end the swings you can have in scores depending on those last scorings/tiles it seemed pointless what you were doing before that. I think we saw the best/worst possible luck there but left so bad taste that I don't think I need to try game again.

RATING: 7
The board is two-sided: there is an introductory version of the game on one side, with some fixed spaces, and an "advanced" version on the other. There are also some optional rules to make the game more complex. My advice is to go straight to the "advanced-complex" game, incorporating all the elements. With all the options, Seeland is still only 2/5 for complexity

Seeland incorporates a rondel which restricts the tiles available on your turn, but allows you to plan ahead and see what will become later. After selecting a tile is is placed on the board, adjacent to other tiles: players attempt to maximise their own score, and may also attempt to sabotage their opponents scoring. The Governor (advanced scoring option) adds a target threshold for some windmills- the threshold is variable and may be controlled by another player. Moreover, as each tile placement makes more spaces on the board available, players also have to consider the spaces that will become available to their opponents.

Gameplay is excellent with two players, and very very good with three or four people of equivalent skill. It is an advantage sitting after an newbie: it takes a game to understand the options you may be handing the following player. This is more than compensated for by the rondel mechanism and advanced scoring option. Seeland plays briskly (about an hour) and has attractive components.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]In some ways I am surprised this game has been such a hit with everyone in my family, but then again it is the perfect combination of simple and elegant rules with a lot of depth to explore while playing. The game actually feels quite thematic, there is a nice exploration quality when placing windmills and plenty of opportunity to mess with your opponents. On top of that this game is excellent at all player counts, including 2, and you have a vastly underrated game I would recommend to just about anyone. You can play it as a lighter family game or use some of the optional variants to make the game more difficult. 

Unfortunately it suffers from having a typical Euro cover which makes you think it is going to be another Euro in the same mold as many others. Definitely not the case and a game you should check out. Also Kramer was one of the designers and the income wheel seems to be the precursor to the resource wheel found in Palaces of Carrara.[/i]

[i]- Excellent 2 and 3 player game [i](and my wife really likes it).[/i]
- The theme shines through for me, the mechanics of the game simulate the 
- Love the wooden windmills, the board looks beautiful as you place windmills and the well illustrated tiles [i](which feature different crops).[/i]
- Simple mechanics (buy a tile, place a tile and possibly score a windmill), but a lot of hidden depth to be found in those simple choices.
- The rondel mechanic used to handle your income in this game is genius.

This is another Kramer/Kiesling game that I love. After my first play I was a bit underwhelmed because the choices seemed to be very simple. However; after repeated play there is a lot of thought that goes into placing crops and windmills. There is a lot of player interaction depending on how aggressive you want to be with your tile placement. This game is a joy to play, I am definitely leaning more towards games that present thoughtful decisions in an easily understood framework.[/i]

Beautiful! This is another great medium weight game that can be played on busy weeknights. The mechanics are well integrated and really make the game fun. My wife enjoys the treasure collecting aspect of the game of working her way out to reveal unknown tiles. She tends to miss some really great points this way but she has fun. The game is very simple, collect the most points around your windmills. The whole mechanic of money in the game is just great...it's all part of the roundel type movement. The simple bets you get to place when you make a good score also add to the fun of the game.

RATING: 7
Nice mid-weight Euro with easyish rules and easy game-play. Throw the theme out, it's a game of getting out your scoring piece, surrounding it with high-scoring field tiles (kinda Carc-cloister like), and scoring when enclosed. Or even better, placing your scoring piece into areas that are most the way enclosed already, or that other players are likely to close anyway allowing you both to score. There's some wibbles on the drafting of the tiles which is neat ... the further ahead in the queue you draft on one turn, the less options you have next turn, so you need to weigh that up. There are a bunch of random tiles placed out that turn over when you build next to them that could score you points or extra turns and both are good. The game is one of taking opportunities, very tactical, scoring the best you can and trying not to set up the next player with big scores. There's probably too much luck involved in the result if someone acquires too many extra-turn coins, so it's worthwhile going into the game looking for them.  Otherwise it's devoid of any major strategic overlay, but simply rolls along pleasantly in its 45 min light-end timeslot.

This game is was a pleasant surprise. When I found it on Amazon for $20 I decided to give it a shot since it seemed to be pretty cool. It is a tile placement game with a nice rondel to work around. I hear it can be cut throat for tiles and placement but in our game it didn't seem so bad. I would like to play with more as I know it will be more interesting when the locations on the land will be less open and indeed, more cut throat. Could be quite fun! I enjoyed it and my one play and love the look of the game. Very pretty. Components aren't the best quality but that is ok. Cool game.

I last played this game in 2014. I liked it ok at the time, but wound up replacing it with other, similar games. A friend brought it by this week wanting to play it, so holding fond memories I gave it a go. I'm sad to say it really hasn't held up well.

In this game, you have a tile selection wheel, and an area where the tiles will be placed. There are essentially two types of tiles. Windmills, and flowers. When a windmill is completely surrounded by 2 or more types of flowers, you sum the values of all tiles being considered and score those points. There's a little more to the game than that in that during the tile selection process you can spend money to jump over the next tile on the wheel, but you can't jump more than a few spaces ahead if one player hasn't jumped any spaces yet. There are also houses which when built next to give you an extra action coin. Ultimately though the process manages to be both mathy and dull.

The game also comes with some mini expansions of varying degrees of quality. One lets you place a marker down when you score, and then whoever got the most points gets even more bonus points at the end. Very weak. Another, gives your windmills ever shifting target numbers of points you need to hit to get a bonus, and not be penalized. I liked this one, because it meant you might delay completion of a mill on a turn the target number of points is too high. Overall though, it's not enough to turn this ok game into something I'd be willing to play again.

This is a good game. Something I get out usually when non gamers are around or people who have played a few games. Its pretty to look at and has enough going on to keep you interested. This isnt something I pull off the shelf to take to game night or if Im at home playing with gaming friends. I am glad to have this one though, very well done art and some interesting mechanics.

Seeland is a bit misleading. The initial reading of the rules and the 1st few rounds of your first game, you might think this is a more complicated game. The unique rondel mechanics introduce an interesting way for players to limit eachothers spending. Scoring is simple, but become rather intuitive when playing by the more advanced rules using the records and governors. The basic game seems very random and I don't recommend it.

Overall, this is a delightful game that stands apart from anything else in my collection. It's a little bit mathy and can cuffer from analysis paralysis in the late rounds, but could easily appeal to casual and serious gamers alike.

This game has some really unique aspects to it.  The use of money with the village wheel is really great and reminds me of the press your luck aspect of thebes and glen more but used in a financial way.  The rest is area control but optimizing your crops to score the most while balancing the nastiness to block your opponent by playing defense.  Really awesome middle weight thinking game that does have some luck that can swing thing a bit but this can be compensated for.   Can't believe I almost traded this away before playing it.

It's like carcassonne with only cloisters.  So, not that interesting.  The market looks like a neat rondel variant on paper, but it's actually too permissive to be interesting.  Overall, the game feel low on choices: on your turn, do the obvious best thing.  If there is nothing good to do, slightly spite one opponent with a bad tile.  Hope you flip over high tiles.

The advanced variant in the rules just adds a runaway leader problem -- it adds two mechanics that both reward things you already want to do.  So, they just further reward the player who is able to do them, which is largely luck.

Lastly, it is a shame that the three types of crops that are distinguished by brightly colored tiles are functionally identical in every regard.  I feel there was a missed opportunity at adding another layer to the game that would make placing windmills strategic rather than simply an exercise in simple addition.

Nothing about the game fails miserably or breaks, but there is no depth at all.

Seeland is pretty fun little game about laying different number tiles around windmills to score points. There are few bonuses you can obtain by meeting certain criteria and certain penalties you can.in the game you are claiming tiles in a circular wheel and placing them onto the board next to your windmills.

Pros: simple rules , fast gameplay , beautiful board

Cons: not a strong theme comes out, game is very mathy which may throw off some players.

Another one of those games that I understand why it doesn't get great reviews, but we picked it up cheaply and it has been worth adding in to our collection.  As others have said, the "Rondel" use in bidding for resources is a great part of the game and, so far, we have found that it is a good balance of luck, planning, and strategy.

The basic game here is really just that - quite basic. As you start to add different modules from the advanced game the richness increases. Still, it feels a bit tacked on, as if they came up with the base system, thought it a bit dull (but with potential), and looked for ways to improve on it by adding little quirky scoring bonuses - that's all they are really.

However, the game never leaves the comfort of the family category in complexity and is easy enough to teach, even to young children. The theme is engaging - especially if you've ever seen some of the old windmills and spun your kids a tale about draining the fields for farming and flooding them to defend against Spanish invasions. The maths is never too taxing, the market system is simple yet clever. All in all a good light family game, although perhaps little dull to stand up to frequent plays. There is only limited player interaction and it tends to be passive aggressive negative in nature. The bag graphic on the back of tiles is completely unnecessary and adds to fiddliness of the game. The experience lacks a little spark. Unfortunately, splitting the game rules into two halves has done this one no favours.

I played one 2P game so far.  So the following is based on that.

I like the rondel system and the way you decide how far ahead to jump (if you can).  For a Dutch farming game, it is an interesting mix of planting seeds and placing mills.  

Plays well enough with 2, but strategically is probably MUCH different with 3 or 4.

This game reminds me of Samurai; it's what you might get if you put it together with Carcassonne and added a rondel. It's like Samurai in that you score points based on hexagonally adjacent tiles on a shared board, and there are incentives to piggyback on the efforts of other players. Like Carcassonne, you're limited by your pieces, and you only remove them when you score them. There's also a rondel to constrain tile selection, which leads to some interesting tempo management. Underrated old-style euro.

This is a reasonably light tile laying game.  In this game players use this really neat rondel that represents each player's currency to pick a windmill or crop to place on the board.  The mills and crops each have a different point value and whenever you surround one of your mills with crops you score points based on the points on the tiles as well as the variety of different crops.

The brightest star in this game is the rondel, it is a very neat game mechanic.  Each player's position on the rondel represents how much currency they have and currency is used to skip over tiles at the market and take another.  This currency also constantly fluctuates based on whoever has the most currency.  Whoever has the most always has the maximum of 4 coins to spend and when they spend money to skip tiles the coin circles around to the end of the rondel giving all players more currency.

Past the rondel the game is a very light and accessible tile laying game where you are just trying to surround your mills with the highest value and most varied crops.  There is a decent amount of screwage available since you can place mill tiles next to any developed tile on the board so you can place low valued mill tiles around your opponents mills they intend to score.

I will say that the game is probably a little more interesting with more players.  It plays up to 4 and with just 2 players you are able to spread out on the map and play more of a solitaire game.  The rondel also fluctuates a lot more often since only 2 players are involved in the economy.  3 and 4 would make for more competition and interaction.

Very pretty production , interesting theme and great 'Rondel' tile selection mechanic

However, the game (like fellow 2010 Nuremburg release) seems to be all about what easy pickings you are left fron the player to your right and what you leave to the player on your left. So tactical, not strategic.

Happily play again, would not purchase.

Another smooth and elegant game by one of my favourite authors. The luck in the base game really doesn't bug me, as it is manageable to some extent. I would recommend to play with both included 'expansions'; they add some interesting options.

This is also very good with two. On top, the design is really gorgeous.

Middle-weight tile placement game. Tricky little tile-purchase mechanism, simple placement & scoring rules. Only played the 'tactical variant' (with all options) so far, 2-player & 4-player.

Playing this reminds me of Knizia's Kingdoms.

It's kind of like Kingdoms except that:

- instead of counting rows & columns, you just count tiles surrounding a hex
- instead of placing a castle or a random tile you instead choose from a limited set of mills & crops.

The tile choosing feels [i]more[/i] controlled & interesting than Kingdoms - there's a rondel where you can skip forward but at the risk of seriously constraining your tile choices for next turn.

The tile placement is [i]more[/i] restricted & perhaps [i]less[/i] interesting than Kingdoms - mills (scoring opportunites) must be adjacent to a placed tile, while crops must be adjacent to one of your mills.

The games aren't alike, but something feels similar

Some designers just click with you on so many levels.  For my family, that designer is Gunther Burkhardt.  We've enjoyed a good many of his games and the newest favorite from him (and co-designer Wolfgang Kramer) is Seeland.

What makes this game so good?  Simple rules and tough choices.  I'll tell you right now, skip the basic game.  It's too easy and isn't fun.  Go right for the full Monty and you'll see just how beautiful this design is.

Warning:  You've got to play like a jerk to do well.  Being nice will result in a good game, but not a great one.  The nastiness is necessary because blocking your opponents is often a key move.

This is a good game.  The play time is just right for the amount of game it is.  The tactical nature of it is perfect for 2 players.  After having played both sides of the board I think we will do the random side from now on.  I do like the perfect information but the surprise of expansion is fun.  Playing with records and governors is crucial.  These give the right bump in strategy this game needs.  I like how you can push your scoring timing around in the game, it's very open.

It looks nice too and the components are top notch.

The flipping of island tiles is a little bit bullshit, with such variable value in random tile flips, but I enjoyed the fast turns, little tactical choices and pretty graphic design.

It's classic Ravensburger family fun, but that's not a complaint, just an observation.

Update: Playing with the non-random board removes the swingyness of tokens but adds in the potential for some AP as everything can now be calculated. If people play quickly, it's still a nice game.

RATING: 6.7
tile-laying game with nice Netherlands windmill and land reclaiming theme
looks very nice
has some interesting mechanics (rondel, governors, records, ...)
but a lot of randomness, swingy moves and 'take that'
almost just a 2 player game, because it loses a lot of strategic considerations with more players ?
contains variants to either simplify the game (remove governors and/or records) or reduce randomness (predefined and revealed land tiles)
plays a bit odd because players often share the same point tiles (equalizing the points out in the long run) and can't avoid preparing good moves for opponents

in short:
+ theme and looks
+ mechanics and variants
0 a lot of 'take that'
- swingy moves
- not that good with more than 2 players ?
- a lot of points sharing and preparing opponents big moves
- board out of 6 puzzle pieces here not so good

Not sure about those Voigts and Records. They seem to give advantages to the players already getting lucky draws with their scorings.

Quite abstract, yet very approachable with the simple rules for asset acquisition and tile placement.

Seeland is a tile laying game about building windmills to reclaim marshy land in the Netherlands and then planting a diversity of crops.  You are selecting crops and windmills from a circular track, and you're constrained which ones you can take.  The next one on the track is free but you have to spend coins to skip ahead.  Except coins are on a communal track, where you move your worker ahead on the coin spots to spend money.  You only get more money when all other players move off the farthest back coin space, which then moves to the front of the coin line.  Your windmills score when they are completely surrounded and you want to get plant tiles of different types and with high numbers.  The game is fairly simple, but there's a not bad game here.  I've heard that it's absolutely cutthroat and highly strategic at a two player count, which I'd like to try.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
This was on my radar due to the double Rondel thing. But I watched a video of the gameplay and found the rest of the game uninteresting, while simultaneously my curiosity was satisfied on the Rondel mechanic.

Basically, one Rondel is the collective Rondel as in Santiago de Cuba (there's only one car and when you drive the car somewhere only you get the perk), and the other one is serving a very similar purpose to worm-laying in If Wishes Were Fishes (you pay to move further). But instead of an actual worm currency, the game tracks how much more you've "spent" on movement than the other players, and does not allow you to outspend them beyond a limit. Pretty cool.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Seeland had some neat stuff going on. The "money" system was pretty novel; everyone's money has to be within a small range of each other, so if you don't spend much, you're forcing others to spend a small amount too, limiting their options. It's fairly interactive without having a destructive element, and the luck is certainly present but not out of control.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This could rate higher with more plays. Unexpected positives, as it initially struck me as a bland Euro in appearance.

Highly tactical, the rondel for selecting tiles is sweet, and despite the crowded colors it carries an aesthetic experience that I liked too. Rare that I would like a point-salad Euro, and lacking Knizian simplicity & scoring structure, and it doesn't have suddenness of a PoC, but somehow it adds up to more than it's parts. 2-player only.

Have been watching this game for a while as it looked like a lightweight game with fun decisions, and I was right! Moves very quickly as tile laying games do with lots of fun planning and decisions to weigh. You can be surprisingly mean in your actions if an opponent makes a mistake over-spending, you can make them pay for it for several turns. Really enjoy s game and it's a steal at the price it's been going for.

RATING: 8

A fun tile purchasing game, with an exploration and area control scoring element. Purchase tiles from a rondel, place them on the board, and when one of your windmills is surrounded by tiles, score it. Diversity is rewarded with bonus points, and monoculture is punished by scoring 0 points. If you're clever and nasty, you can place a tile in an area and force a monoculture on your opponent. Very interesting market system in the purchase rondel, in that each tile you skip over to choose a better tile costs you 1 money. But, you only have 5 money, and can't get more until all your opponents have spent some. It's a neat self balancing thing, if I want to stop my opponent from spending money, I have to stop spending myself. Another strong point in the game is that it is very malleable, the board has two sides, one with a fixed setup of tiles, one with random tiles, and there are rules you can add or subtract to customize the game for your own kind of preferences.

I've played Seeland twice on the 'random island' side of the board, both games with two players. I won the second game by 11 points in a game where we each got > 200 points.

My husband found it mediocre but enjoyed the game. I found it boring with the only mild entertainment being flipping the random island tiles to see if I turned up a farmhouse (extra turn coin).

The action rondel, with two players, doesn't provide sufficient constraint so, within reason, it's possible to take whichever action you want. Typically I had two windmills on the board at any one time positioned to leave only two spaces free. This meant that the best tile to take from the rondel each turn was largely obvious. 

Going around and around on the rondel was strangely repetitive and - by about halfway through my second play - I was willing us to get to the bottom of the vegetable/field tile stack so the game would end.

Seeland is doubtless a great game for chess lovers and people who enjoy euro optimisation games, especially with the non-random island tile variant that removes most of the luck on the board.

RATING: 6
A very enjoyable game with several interesting and unique mechanics- in particular the two different rondels are quite clever and engaging. My initial play with (a) four players, and (b) the tiles face down during setup was a bit tactical for my tastes but I imagine this could be more strategic with three players and the tiles face up, so much so that I could envision picking this up if it turns out satisfying me with repeat plays.

Éditeur, nb joueurs : 2 à 4 joueurs.
Éditeur, durée : 0h45 à 1h00/partie.

►PUBLIC(S) QUE JE RECOMMANDE:
☺ Jeu tactique (plus d’éléments aléatoires et/ou de hasard raisonné).
® Je crains que son allure "sobre" soit peu attrayante pour les jeunes.

►JOUEURS, NOMBRE(S) QUE JE RECOMMANDE:
# Nombres non-déterminés.

►COMMENTAIRE(S) ABRÉGÉ(S):
- THÈME : quasi-abstrait; peu ressenti.
- Déroulement répétitif : peut donner l’impression que toutes les parties se ressemblent.
+ Expériences multiples : au moins 1 extension officielle incluse.
+ Expériences multiples : version de base et une version tactique.
+ Icônes : les icônes sont faciles à comprendre ou à mémoriser.

►REMARQUE(S) PERSONNELLE(S):
® Je crains qu’il retienne peu l’intérêt des joueurs lorsque le stade de la nouveauté sera passé.

1e essai  à 4 joueurs (version de base + prévôts). Bien que j'ai trouvé sa mécanique de rondelle intéressante, son manque de thème et son côté calculatoire n’ont pas retenu mon intérêt (ni celui des 3 autres joueurs d’ailleurs). Cependant, ce même côté mathématique pourrait être intéressant pour la pratique du calcul mental chez les jeunes (si le thème retient leur intérêt). À noter que ce jeu semble plus apprécié dans sa configuration à 2 joueurs (qui serait alors plus stratégique) mais je ne tiens pas à le réessayer pour le vérifier.

RATING: 8.3
This is a very fun game. I love the rondel used for spending money. I love the tile-laying aspects. Trying to maximize scores based on the numbers of goods you have is very fun. We played it the first time pretty passively, but I can see where you could really try to screw each other over. Seems like it would be even more fun with more people. Very solid game.

It's a very nice game that can be easily explained to others.

Teaching: (Yet to teach).
Mastery: (45 minutes as quoted).
Square box, 3/4 depth.

Place windmills.
Plant diverse crops.
Rondel to determine crops taken.

Designed by Wolfgang Kramer of Kramer and Kiesling, and Günter Burkhardt who designed Maori, Darjeeling and Casa Grande, Seeland looks to be another great little efficient Euro, a type of game I seem to be specialising in. Charming mechanics and components, I'm keen to get a first play in soon.

A "Solid 7" Euro.  Good choices between whether to pursue a luckless strategy or push your luck in getting to what you want.  Nice board.

A nice looking, easy and quick to play. Quite a lot of control to help you push your luck.

In the Netherlands placing windmills and planting hex tiles of cabbage, tulips and canola. Watch out for the Governor. Uses a rondel to manage the market. Nice art, nice play. Just not my bag.

RATING: 8
Simple and elegant tile-laying game with clean mechanics and slightly thin theme.  Easy to teach, lots going on, and fun.  I like the currency tracking wheel a lot.

RATING: N/A
Unusual theme with winning rondel mechanic. Connoisseurs of bgg style games say it's a hidden gem. Its two game variants can divide opinion but combo of both is apparently where it's at according to the well informed Mr Duff.

The rondel works well and it is an interesting game with a nice mix of luck and strategy. I feel the game will grow on me but too early to say just now.

RATING: 5
A harmless and fairly enjoyable game until the end, then it just gets annoying. In the last few turns, you might be able to grab a necessary tile and trigger your long-planned scoring coup, or the game might end too quickly and that scoring might never happen.  It just seems fairer to allow partial scoring for incomplete sections at game's end - perhaps half-points to unscored mills.

The fight for space and tiles is reasonably fun, regardless, and the rondel is put to good use.  Though unaware players will consistently set up opponents later in turn order for superhuman scoring opportunitiues, meaning that Seeland can (and will) suffer from "player to the n00b's left wins!" syndrome.

First play was slow to start and then over quickly and uninspiring. Needs some more plays.

Really like the atmosphere and artwork of this one, since I'm from Holland myself. Gameplay is about what you would expect from a Kramer, not a brainburner but some interesting decisions and a bit of luck.

An awful lot of positive comments on this one from my geekbuddies... seems like an overlooked and unique gem of a middleweight Euro.  So when it went on sale more than usual on Amazon I scooped up a copy!

RATING: 7
This falls into the category of relaxing games that still have some interesting decision making. The rondel works really well although most of the tile-buying choices are pretty obvious. Score-keeping is a bit of a chore but there really isn't a way around it, and everything else plays so smoothly.

A great lightweight game.  Easy rules, fun and looks nice.  Prefer this over ttr for an intro to designer games.

Mueve a tu mercader en el mercado circular para adquirir tierras o molinos. Luego colócalos en el tablero. Cuando un molino esté completamente rodeado se cosecha y puntúa según los paisajes que lo rodean siempre que tenga al menos 2 tipos de paisaje alrededor.

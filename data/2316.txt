See Micro Mutants: Evolution;  we got this first and it sat on the shelf for a few months because we never could get the winks to launch.  Then one day we played it on a carpeted floor and then we discovered the awesome little game we'd almost overlooked!

My boys can't get enough of this game, and for that reason alone it's a must own for me. But I played recently against my gaming buddies and we had a blast! Unfortunately, this one can sometimes stretch waaay too long if the tiddly-wink-finesse has gone missing.

If you like Tiddly Winks, you'll love X-Bugs.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
X-Bugs may have significant flaws-- that's up for debate.  That's why I've given it an 8 and not a 9 or 10.  Even so, this is one of the most popular games that I have.  Players are willing to overlook these flaws the way athletes overlook bad calls from the referee.  This is an outstanding action game that incorporates a fair amount of strategy.  If your group is getting burned-out by cerebral games, get this one to liven up the atmosphere.  Several well-worn sets of X-Bugs will always be on my gaming shelf.

Fun game!  Skill, strategy, and luck are needed.  Sometimes there's just no telling where these things will bounce, but that's part of the fun!  A good playing surface is a must; not too soft that you can't get any distance, but not too hard that you can't get height.  I have the Flyborgs and the USArthropod set.  It seems as if the Arthropods are a little weaker than the Flyborgs, and that there is a slight balance problem.  Usually I give the inexperienced played the Flyborgs though, so it evens out in the end.  Overall, a fun game that I would enjoy playing any time!

Tiddlywinks war game with different sized winks and special powers. Brilliant idea and a good laugh. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
We started with the USArthropods (white/blue) and Flyborgs (purple/yellow), and added 2 more armies--the Sovietopters  (light green/green) and the Chitinians (black/red). All of the armies have different special powers, and you really need to play them differently. It's very fun to play with the kids, but all my gamer friends have had fun with it as well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I like the premise here: Bug Wars. Each army has its own special forces and abilities. It makes things more interesting. However, under it all its simply a well-themed game of Tiddly Winks. The thing is, it works. For a Steve Jackson game, the components are very good. I'd play this one any time, as a fun change of pace filler between 'real' games.We own Sets 1 and Sets 3, for a rainbow of color and 4 armies to choose from.

Update: I could almost make this a 10, except that it would depend on who my opponent is. I really enjoy this game, primarily with my son.

RATING: 6
Tiddlywinks war with bugs!  The theme is fun, and the gameplay is pretty good too. It goes on a little longer than it has to, however, and it is often too hard to tell the difference between the different bugs, both on the pieces and on the dice.  Not bad, though.

RATING: 8
We had a gaming night at our church, to celebrate my B-day.  My friend's 7 year old daughter, Joy, asked if I would play this game with her.  She's such a cutie, so it was on offer I couldn't refuse.  So, there I was, on the floor, playing a glorified game of Tiddlewinks with a 7 year old - and I loved it.  Not that I would put this on our regular game night list, but the design, and execution, of the game is quite clever.  While there is a HUGE random effect - after all, it's very hard to exactly control just where a wink is going to land after you tiddle it - the special abilities do impart a slight bit of strategy into the game.  But the best part was that I got to make a little girl happy.  That's worth its weight in gold.  A great way to introduce kids to gaming beyond the usual standards, and a wonderful tool to develop hand-eye coordination, and to introduce the concepts of tactical vs strategic thinking. For adults, it rates a 4 simply because it is more of a kid's game that I wouldn't always want to play.  For kids, I think it deserves a 7 rating, but I'm giving it an 8 just for that one memory.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I played this a couple of times and really enjoyed it.  I have been meaning to dust this off and play it again, but I have never gotten around to it.  I still want to get the other armies.  With the recent influx of dexterity games I wonder if X-Bugs will get reprinted or receive more attention.

RATING: 7
Woe is me.  I suck so bad at this game, and yet I can't stop thinking about it.  I think if I could find the perfect surface to play on, I would buy all the sets and play all the time.  The surface has everything to do with how enjoyable the game is.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A tiddly-winks type game that works very well.  Players have a team of counters with stickers of bugs on them.  Bugs have abilities and powers, which can change if they flip over.  The object is to conquer your opponent's bases.  Great fun, with some interesting decisions to be made along the way.  I'm hooked!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
If Tiddlywinks was a real-time strategy game....   The upgrading of bases, harvesting resource chips is totally in the RTS vein, and everything works with the tiddlywink mechanic.   It's very fun, although the harsh penalties for losing a base may need to be lessened via house rules when playing with kids, which is the only way I can see playing this.  Good variety in the armies, too.  It's a novel and creative game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Clever use of the traditional Tiddly-Winks mechanics.  The different abilities of the forces keeps it interesting.  It lasts a little longer than a game like this should, especially with players who aren't adept at the skills required to manipulate the winks accurately - at that point it can become a little frustrating.  But it's still a fun diversion, and unique enough to warrant purchase.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Played once. Fun game, but can be a little difficult to convince people to play as it's tiddlywinks at it's core.  It doesn't take too long, and has a lot of replayability.  You can never completely control your moves.

This game has become an immediate favorite with the hometown crowd.  Ridiculously fun, but don't dare take it too seriously.  Definitely best with 3 or 4, mocking each other's misses and losses and my patented "No-no-no-no-no-NO!" chant when under attack.  =)  My only complaints are the list price and that three of the USArthropod unit types are difficult to distinguish at a glance.  I found the US version on sale, so I bought it on a whim.  I'm glad I did.  Then I paid a hefty price to import the Italian versions of the new armies, since SJG discontinued supporting it.

I have all Steve Jackson Games sets the original four armies.  One spare copy each of Sets 2 and 4.  I also have Nexus (Italian) versions of the Bifids (Vegemites) and Samaurachnids.

Tiddlywinks done as a sci-fi wargame!  It's actually rather difficult in terms of the tiddlying of the winks (winking of the tiddles?).  You have to land directly on top of your opponent's tokens in order to defeat them.  Each army has several different pieces of varying sizes and shapes, and most of them have some sort of special power.  Each turn, you can activate several of your pieces depending on which icons are showing on the dice.  You're ultimately trying to fly your bugs across the table and assault your opponent's larger, immobile base tokens.

X-Bugs is nothing spectacular, but I've always had fun with it, and it's nicely different from the other games in most (all?) gamers' collections.

RATING: 2
Played 10+ Aimed at 9-12 year old boys. Way too expensive for a page of rules and a handful of counters. The magazine advertising other Steve Jackson games which comes in the box will have cost more to produce than the rule book. The rule book is too big for the box so it is folded in 2. The rules for this game should have been nicely illustrated with some humour, they are unforgivably drab. There should have been a couple of stiff card crib sheets and maybe 4 card arena corners would have been nice. A bit of TLC could have made this into a respectable purchase. I am merely indifferent to the game, it is the producers of the game I have a real problem with. March 04

This was a lot of fun though it went on a little long. We did play on a big table though. This certainly not a serious game and there's little strategy. But if you expect strategy from a tiddly wink game, then you need your head checked anyway! I loved tiddly winks as a kid so I don't doubt kids (and your inner child) will love this even moreso.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (November 2017)

X-Bugs was one of my oldest unplayed games. I don’t remember why I bought it as my desire to play it was always very low. After playing it, I can say it (is) can be a fun game, but it isn’t for me. In general, I don´t like dexterity games, I would play them gladly and I have fun while I play them, but, I own very few games in this category and I never request them.

X-Bugs´s rules are very easy to learn and teach. You can do it under 2 minutes. The special abilities of each unit takes a lot longer to master, but it isn’t hard to learn. Playtime is around 60 minutes.

The game´s components are better than I expected, however, you have to stick a lot of stickers and that always bother me. My SO usually takes care of this though.

The decisions needed to play the game are rather obvious as you roll from 1-3 dice and they tell you what you can do. The “fun” of the game is to flick the pieces onto the desired spot. It is a lot harder than you would think, but, with a little practice, you can improve a lot in a short time. Still, it is a light game.

Best with 2 players, with more, the downtime would begin to bother me for such a simple game.

In my set, there are two different armies and I know that at last another 2 armies exists. I feel the pull to own them all, but I´m better at resisting those urges this year so instead I will sell this set, but if I liked flicking games, I would buy them all as the idea is very interesting (I also own Micro Mutants, but I haven’t played it so I’m not sure about the differences) .

Bottom line, X-Bugs is a good dexterity game, but it is not for me. I would play again if requested, but I have a low desire to do so. I will sell my copy ASAP. It has too much randomness in it, but it feels different from any other game I have played.

It wasn't as exciting as I hoped.  Most likely, this was due to a severe lack of skill on all of our parts but we decided to make the game end more quickly by having whoever defeated two bases first win the game (six player game).  The different races really didn't seem to be well balanced, but that might be really unfair since we were horrible tiddly winkers...:-)  I will likely keep it for now and maybe pull it out another time to give it another go just because its something different.

3 plays.

Nice, original dexterity game, with some tactics and strategy.  Variable player powers are also an enjoyable characteristic of the game.

Requires a relatively large space, and a surface which is not too hard.

The special powers are more complicated, with lengthier explanations than the Russoptères/Arachnoïdes ones.  But there are large round pieces in this set and not in the R/A one, which gives some nice variety.

I was quite enamored with this game the first time I played it.  However, it has hit the table very few times since then and the lust for it is just not there anymore.  It is a clever game, but the balance between armies is terrible and the artwork can sometimes cause confusion especially when trying to decide what side of a base is &#039;upgraded&#039;.

A dexterity game with a bug theme (sorta reminded me of Starship Troopers).  The bugs have powers and each team has a slightly different theme.  I think kids would enjoy this quite a bit and the adults can join in for some "stoopid" fun.

First impression: Weird dexterity game. The basic idea of the game is really good one but there were couple of things bugging me. Firstly, the pieces look way too similar to each other and there are perhaps a little bit too many special units/rules for a game that isn't played too often (this is my personal problem obviously). Secondly, the flipping and actually hitting another bug is too random. I know it is supposed to be hard but it's hard in a wrong - frustrating - way. Even when you succeed it doesn't feel like there were any skill involved. Yes, I know I suck at this... :-)

Battle tiddlywinks for two or four players.
Each team has different abilities but all require dexterity(Blue Moon meets Pitchcar). This was just enough game to be fun and not too long to get boring. The 5-15yr old crowd might find this worth playing multiple times.

Now this is gaming!  Great fun of playing tiddly winks with a bit of strategy. The different shapes and powers make it interesting. Having actions depend on the dice adds an agonizing risk-taking element. Diceland is in the same ballpark and has more interesting powers and the fun of knocking off others players' dice, but X-Bugs is a more polished product.

This is after only one play and I would like to sit down and play it again.  The armies seem a little unbalanced, but maybe with more plays and better skill my opinion will change.

Armies not as unbalanced as I first thought.  A different strategy is needed to play to the strength and weaknesses of the different armies.

The mechanics just aren't my thing - I don't usually like dexterity games like this one.  Also, the pieces confuse me when they're flipped. It is good with little kids though - throw out the dice, let them shoot 3 each turn and it's all good.

I want to like this game.  I can get past the part where I suck at it, but what I'd like to see is a little more control over what I'm doing.  Next time I play this I'd be tempted to scrap the dice or randomly chose and roll one with your other two actions free until your base gets hit (then one free action, then only a die).

Most of the time my best shots were just "Hail Mary"s into a crowd.  I was never able to get a resource...

Played 10+ times. This game is awesome.  Tiddlywinks crossed with WarCraft.  You have different troops that are improved when you upgrade your bases with the resources that you gather.  It's great.  The best defense is a strong offense.  Loosing a die and two bugs is brutal. (I don't think my two teams are evenly matched) 2005/09/29

Steve Jackson Games is publishing this game in the US.  They're being released in 2-packs (USArthropods/Flyborgs, Chitinian/Sovietoptera).  Both packs are being released in TWO color combinations each, so you can accommodate more than 4 players without confusing sides.
USArthropods/Flyborgs: Blue/Yellow and White/Purple.
Chitinian/Sovietoptera: Red/Green and Black/Light Green.

Is it advanced tiddly winks or a deeper strategy game? The game itself seems unsure. There's a lot of cleverness here, but it never seems as fun as you'd hope for. Blame the wingnut theme for making this game not as instantly approachable as it should have been.

The History: In the famous Roswell crash, the alien crew died, but some alien insects survived... and at the moment they're ready to conquer the world! But during the cold war, US and Soviet scientists studied a solution: genetically modified earth insects, strong enough to deal with the menace! The battle is going to begin! The Game: the game is based on the classic tiddlywinks: every army has three "bases" which have to be defended, and various "soldier insects" (winks) with various shapes, dimensions, and special abilities. An "insect" is captured when an opponent "insect" stop over it. A "base" is captured the second time an opponent "insect" stop over it. Three 6-sided creature dice for every army are rolled every turn, and dictates which kinds of insects can move. When you lose a base, you lose a die and therefore some mobility. When you lose the second base, you're out of the game. There are six armies, but only four were published in the United States. The game is sold in boxes containing two armies, and each army is separately available in two colors so identical forces can face each other: USArthropods Vs. Flyborgs; Sovietoptera Vs. Chitinians; Samurachnids Vs. Bifids (not published in the US as of 8/2007). Each set has enough pieces for two players; by combining sets up to 12 can play. About special abilities: some insects can mimetize, some can move twice, other can shoot some weapons like missiles or acid spits (represented by winks, too)... BTW, the Italian name for "Tiddlywinks" is "il gioco della pulce", which means "the game of the flea". Micro Mutants Evolution is an updated version of this game; I only have Set 2: Flyborgs vs USArthropods.

Excellent game concept by Marco Maggi &amp; Francesco Nepitiello. I would have never imagined to find so much strategy involved in a dextery game! Unfortunately a lucky shot on your base early on the game can put you in serious disadvantage. Another problem: it seems that one of new released races (at least in Italy), Samuracnidi, is quite unbalanced, I mean it seems too strong. No problems with the four basic races.

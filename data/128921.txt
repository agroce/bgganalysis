Didn't really have anything to do with [b]Rattus[/b].  Strangely, it played really fast.  It almost took me more time to explain the rules than to play it!  Pretty much just a couple of bluffing mechanisms.  Great art, and it has plenty of variation, it seems.  There is a fair bit of luck too.

We really like this game.  It's short and simple, yet dynamic.  The various buildings provide a nice variety.  I love the push-your-luck element that the nuns who are revealed at the end of the game provide.

I have one huge complaint, which has to do with the components and nothing to do with the game's design.  The influence board, where most of the points you need to win the game are going to be earned, needs to be much bigger.  The same goes for the stupid, egregiously small discs that you move up on said board and will be stacking  throughout the game.  Needless to say, one little nudge of the board and your game can be essentially ruined as the discs roll around, fall off ones they are stacked on, etc.  We actually have had two games ruined already as a result of this.  It's just a huge disappointment given how good the game itself is.  All they had to do was make a bigger board and, more importantly, have flatter but bigger/wider discs (that wouldn't roll around and fall off each other as easily).  The discs used in Caylus, for example, would be much better.

Just tried it. A fast and quick game. A nice balance between advancing on the 6 diferent influence tracks, but to advance more than other players you'll probably have to get rats. And if you have more rats then the sum of the nuns icon on the 5 drawn people cards then you instantly lose the game.

Az alap Rattust nem ismerem. Így nincs viszonyítási alapom.
A Rattus Cartus:
Fix körös játék.
Aki a legtöbb pontot szerzi nyer … már amennyiben túléli a pestist –a patkányokat-.
A patkányokat menetközben lehet „szerezni” illetve lehet tőlük megszabadulni is. Alapból mindenki 10-el indul. Van letéve 5 „apáca” lap: az ezeken található apácák száma adja meg, h mennyi patkánya lehet a játék végén a játékosnak, ha túl akar élni. A 10 az nagyjából az átlag ami a játék végén átlagos esetben lehet, nem véletlen a kezdésnek annyi. Az apácák száma természetesen nem ismert, a lapokon 0-4 lehet, 5 lap: max 20 min. 0 De van lehetőség egyesével megnézegetni a lent lévő lapokat.
1 körben 5 fázis:
1. épületek felfedése /játékosszámtól függően 2 v 3 db/
2. ellátmány szerzés: a felfedett kártyák sarkában 3 féle jel és azok kombinációi: laphúzás, patkány eldobás, apáca megnézés
3. Épület választás /ez független az előző ellátmánytól, azaz bmilyen épület választható, az előző ellátmányszerzésnek semmi köze hozzá, nem kell azt választani/
4. épületek kiértékelése – és az akcióik
5. új kör előkészítés

Van ugye a 6 társadalmi osztály, minden osztályhoz 2 féle épület tartozik. Minden fajtából 5 db van, azaz 12*5 épület. Ebből 30 kerül be a játékba.
Az alapleosztás javaslat szerint adott 6 épületfajta, de ezek az alap fajták, kipróbáltuk először így, az se rossz, de izgalmasabb, ha az adott osztály mindkét fajta épületéből teszünk bele. (azok között már vannak izgalmasabb lapok, akciók is. A javasolt 6 féle épületben nincsenek a plusz akciókat adó spec lapkák, tán csak a kard, illetve más egyéb jóságok is benne.)

épületválasztás: sorban mindenki megmondja melyik épületbe akar bemenni, s mennyi lapot játszik ki (ezt le is teszi képpel lefelé). Egy épületbe bhányan mehetnek, mindenki csak 1 épületbe mehet, döntetlen esetén az előbb beérkezőé az elsőbbség.
Milyen lapokat játszunk ki? Vannak lakosság kártyák: ezek a 6 társadalmi osztálynak megfelelő 6 féle fajta. Ezeket illetve a spec kártyákat lehet kijátszani. természetesen csak 1 számot mondunk: nem lehet tudni miből s mennyit.
Miután mindenki belépett egy épületbe –van passz kártya: lehet késleltetni a sorra kerülést vele-: épület-értékelés:
Az épületek sorban értékelődnek. (Fontos!)
Adott épületben meg kell nézni ki mennyi lakosság kártyát játszott ki. (plusz dzsókert). Aki a legtöbbet, az nyeri az épület fő akcióját, mindenki más a másod akciót. (A 2 ugyanolyan típusú csak a prémium több)
De ez csak a második része az épület értékelésnek: elébb a kijátszott lakosság –és dzsóker- kártyáknak megfelelően előrelép a játékos az épület osztályának megfelelő befolyássávon. Mindegy milyen lakosság fajta kártya. Csak a db szám számít. Azaz pl. parasztság típusú épületen a nemesség vagy papság lap is előrelépést ad. Az előrelépés után viszont az épület típusának nem megfelelő lakosságlapért, minden darabért 1 patkány jár.
Ezután jön még a spec kártyák kiértékelése az épületen, ha volt kijátszva (mástól lap elvevős, patkány átadós).
S csak ezután jön az elébb említett épület akciók végrehajtása/megkapása (sok féle: lapokhoz lehet jutni, patkánytól megszabadulni, spec lapokat szerezni, apácát nézni stb)

Ha minden épület kiértékelve, kör vége.
Épületek kuka, adott mennyiségű új épület le, kezdőjátékos-jelző balra, új forduló.

Ennyi.
S a pontozás a legvégén:
a 6 befolyássáv mindegyikén 10-5-2 pont az 1.-2.-3. helyezettnek. (döntetlen esetén aki előbb ott volt az van előbb)
A menetközben szerzett pár pontocska
A spec lapok minden típusából (4 féle) akinek a legtöbb van kézben: plusz pont
a lakosság lapból akinek a legtöbb kézben plusz pont

S ezután megnézzük ki élte túl a pestist.

Gyors, 4 fővel 1 óra alatt. Érdekes, izgalmas, pörgős, szerencsét sem nélkülöző, egymás ellen is játszós –azaz interaktív. Szóval bejövős.
(Mondom ezt úgy, h a 2 parti mindegyikében tök utolsó, nagyon lemaradva, igaz az elsőben nem lettem utolsó, mert jött a pestis, és a legtöbb pontot szerző játékos elhullott )
Update: még mindig jó, és 5-en is. Gyors, tervezhető. újrajátszhatóság: sokféle épület

Decent enough card game placed in a larger "full" box to accommodate some extra bits and extra card sets that provide variety. A different experience from it's original iteration... less elegant, but more depth. Neither is particularly remarkable, which is why I sold both, but each is a solid game none-the-less.

Nice little set collection bidding game however the special cards seem to come up a little too infrequently and therefore have quite a warping effect when they are actually used in the game (swords spring to mind). The victory points for different colours based upon where you are in relation to your peers is a nice touch and encourages you to bid on a variety of effects.

There seems to be far to many ways to remove rats and, with sensible play, no real way to gain more than you can handle therefore the end game feels a little by-the-numbers since there is no real threat of losing due to having more rats than nuns.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great game! So many different decisions interacting with everything going on, like a complex steampunk engine. A card game with the added influence aspect that results from your card plays, coupled with the negative aspects of playing cards that don't match the correct suite, plus the unknown element of the nuns that can be modified - maybe. Very nice little game, but the rule book made things much more difficult than they needed to be by not clarifying several points. Very simple and easy to teach once you know what's going on.

This is quickly turning into one of out favorite fillers. It plays pretty quick, depends on some luck but still has some tactical aspects to it (which buildings will you choose, which bonusses will you get etc).

The two-player game is very different from the 3/4 player game, but they're both great.

Rattus Cartus was actually better than I remembered from when I played it the first time. It's nothing particularly deep, but what it does is quite nice. I like The idea that overplaying cards can bring you rats but also points and that you could lose it all on rats. There's just enough different actions to make the game feel varied and the special cards when included add a bit of interaction which is welcome.  It almost plays as an abstract as the mechanics are really not related to the theme at all. Doesn't bother me so much in this game though.  A solid, light game!

Very pleased with my first impressions of this game.  It has this interesting mechanic where even if you win there's a chance you would have pushed your luck too much and end up losing but it's fun to play so you don't mind the losing so much (because secretly you know that you've won it)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Too much hidden information and luck. The most pronounced is the hidden threshold for corruption. You can spend actions peaking at it, but that is very slow and imprecise and your subsequent actions may reveal the essence of what you have learnt to your opponents. There's also a bit of negative player interaction to make the game 'fun'. There are some nuggets of neat ideas and interesting decisions but I think on the whole I wouldn't like this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The link to Rattus is only in theme. Rattus Cartus is a game of majorities. Players vie to get the most influence with six different factions. To gain influence, players bid with cards from their hands for one of the available action cards. Depending on the color of the action card and the number of cards of that color played, players gain influence. Obviously, drawing many cards of the same color is a clear advantage. Furthermore, players get to execute the action associated with the cards which brings differing advantages. There are some special cards involved and at the end players check whether their rat count is below or above the more or less secret line. Some players might automatically lose, the final VP count is mostly determined by who managed to get the most influence with more factions than the competition.
I'm still waiting for the second great game of the Bergs after Oregon which is one of my absolute favourites. Rattus was a disappointment, Rattus Cartus is ok.

The biggest offender I've ever seen of poor production quality ruining a game experience,  The game is not the best game of all time, but it's a fun little card game with some interesting stuff going on.  We did not enjoy playing it however, the card were miscut, badly, the colors were way too close to each other, pink and lavender cards, bright red and dark orange game pieces, tall round progress trackers, which need to be moved around and stacked... just so many horrible decisions when this game was published.  By the time it was over the entire table had had enough.  

I would be interested in a republish with a retheme and maybe a few tweaks.

Basically an auction game where you're bidding within card suits, and can play a number of off-colour cards with a glorious push-your-luck mechanic where you're simply eliminated if you pushed too far and underestimated the safe level of plague. Fun, but endgame scoring is fiddly, and the theme seems too arbitrarily fantastical; nuns should at least be plague doctors.

And I thought it’s the cardgame version of Rattus. But it isn’t. Well, it has more or less the same theme, some similar tiny ideas and the same artwork and iconography, but the game is completely different. But it’s possibly just as fun as the board game while it's more tricky than that. And knowing the designers’ previous games I dare not to say it’s very luck-dependent: Oregon and Rattus also seems more luck-dependent first than how they actually are. Still, the end of the game was funny: when we played, each player lost as we had only 4 nuns out of the possible 20 helping us (according to calculations, the probability of this happening is 5.9% which is not that low)

Did not enjoy this much.  The inability to plan for anything was annoying.  The scoring track was a disaster with five players, as a couple of times things were jostled or we could not hold onto the little disk which fell down, rolled, and knocked the other markers about.  Went on a couple rounds too long.  Just nothing special enough here to make me come back.  The total disconnect with any theme also disappointing.

Same outlook, but totally different from the board game. It has more depth (not difficult :P), because every decision will affect you in more than one way.

The one thing it has in common with the boardgame is the interaction between players.

There's a big dose of randomness in almost everything; that makes every game completely different from the previous one. There are no pre-made strategies. The player that manages to adapt better to it (luck is also important), has most chances to be the winner.

And then there's the "greed factor", allowing you to perform better for an increased chance to die and lose the game directly...

40 minutes is the ideal lenght for this kind of game.

The theme is forced, but the graphic design is nice (on the same line as the boardgame).

After first try: Seems like there are few strategy choices. The player who draws the most cards will win (as long as he gets to keep them from attackers). 
This game also allowed very few rats (5) so the only player not lost to the rats was the player who had seen all the rats cards, and never played cards that gave rats.

1) It doesn't feel like Rattus at all, imho it's a cardgame for which they want to increase sales and therefore attach a well selling game title to it

2) My 1 play with 3 was rather flat. Probably best with 5 I think as you then would have the most competition. off course, it would maybe go really fast if everybody would pick extra cards as a bonus. So have to try it first!

Gyors, alig 1 óra alatt lejátszható játék, amiben pici szerepe ugyan van a szerencsének, de ennyi kell! 
A játék lényege az, hogy éljük túl a pestis-járványt úgy, hogy közben a lehető legtöbb pontot gyűjtjük.
Minden körben van lehetőség az alap 10 patkánytól, amik a pestist jelzik, megszabadulni, illetve bizonyos vásárlások esetén kaphatunk is.
A szabály szerencsére nem túl bonyolult, kezdők is elsajátíthatják könnyen.
A játék végén a pontozás után felfordítjuk azt az 5 apácalapot, amit az elején leraktunk, ez fogja meghatározni, hogy hány patkánnyal sikerül túlélnünk a pestist, tehát meghalunk, vagy sem. Ezt az 5 lapot egyébként megnézhetjük egy külön akcióért cserébe.
A játék izgalmas, viszonylag pörgős, jó!

This game has some interesting mechanics. I like the rats but I wish they gave more tension. This game feels kind of like an area control game, but there are no areas. It is unique. It also feels kind of soulless. The theme just is not there and the artwork is bland. All of the mechanics work together but they do not engage. For me this falls very squarely into the "it's a good game but not a great game" category.

Played once with 4P. I have really vague memories about what the original Rattus was about, but this card game is quite good. Rattus Cartus has players bidding cards from their hand to gain the majority of influence in buildings which are randomly revealed in each round. Each building has a corresponding citizen, and players generally want to bid using the corresponding citizens. Of course, players may use any other citizen, but end up with penalties in the form of rats. 

There are immediate benefits of gaining a majority in a specific building (gaining special cards, citizens, VP or removing rat tokens) as well as long-term benefits too (end-game VP). Players will have to balance these while ensuring that their rat population is kept at a decent level, failing which they are automatically disqualified from winning at the end of the game.

As you cannot anticipate the upcoming buildings or the cards that you draw, Rattus Cartus is more tactical than strategic. Once past the rather complex rules, this is a surprisingly quick (~45 mins) and interactive game.

Almost entirely unlike Rattus in every way, but I can see why they used the existing brand to sell the game.

Rattus Cartus is much more abstract and has you managing a hand of cards and trying to bid to win influence in various houses whilst avoiding rats. It all worked fairly well together and was mildly interesting, but it seemed as though there was a lot of luck involved in which cards came up and when.

Really just not good. There's a huge advantage for whoever goes last each round so it almost doesn't matter what you do if you're not going last. There is also a huge luck-of-the-draw element that basically determines how well you do, especially in the final round. If you don't draw the right cards, there is literally nothing you can do sometimes. Not good.

Sold.

I really like this game, although I do like Rattus and I think the theme is very fun, my kids do not like to play it as much.  So I was excited to hear that Rattus Cartus uses the theme of Rattus and some elements, but is strategically a different game in its own right.  And a great one at that.  I have read comments about the publisher just using the theme to its advantage.  I don't necessarily agree since it is the same designer and elements are similar to Rattus. i.e. character actions, and picking the different building cards in the different types (magic, military, etc.).  It is an easy game to teach and is very fun, quick, and efficient.  My kids enjoyed it, and so do I.  Don't be afraid to give this one a try if you can get your hands on it!  Glad I took the time to move it to the top of the stack in my "games to learn and play pile!

Solid "Rattus" themed Euro card game that's about majorities but you'll need to get familiar with what the buildings do for you.

Card driven area majority in Europe during the Black Death. Six scoring tracks for the different kinds of buildings. Play people cards face down to pay cost for controlling position of an activated building card. Resolve majority to advance on the scoring track and use that card's ability. Take rat token corruption for cards paid in the cost that do not match the building's suit. Interesting conflict between pushing up the scoring track while managing the level of rat corruption. The wild cards make it good. The swords add a bluff element. Not sure enough is here to engage my group.

An interesting twist on the original 'Rattus' board game.
 
This falls into a category that I appreciate: different enough from the game that inspired it to warrant owning both, but not so different that it seems like a pasted-on theme as a means to cash-grab.

Be aware that it is a rather mean game and can be a bit tricky to wrap your head around.

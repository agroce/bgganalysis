RATING: 7
1st play - Tactical card game with a very cool theme and symmetrical decks.  Actions are limited and lots of room to play different strategies.  I am reminded a little of Netrunner with the goal of hiding agendas and trying to seek out the other player's weak spots.  

2nd play - Really satisfying to lay traps and fake each other out, bluffing shield walls where there are trolls and guessing when to seek the other player's hand for hidden powerful cards.  A great 2 player experience that plays in about 30 minutes.

RATING: 8.75
Vast improvement over Hera and Zeus; but the much needed text on the cards can, nevertheless, be a tad vague at times, and the wooden standees are totally unnecessary. Apart from that, a great, short game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Reasonably fun two player symmetrical battle.  Quick to learn, and a bit of room for strategic play. Low luck  factor for a card game, as there are clear tactics to mitigate bad draws and to stall if needed.  I'm awful at it.

RATING: 7
All the fun and bluffing of Netrunner meets all the fun and bluffing of Stratego, without the need to know a huge card pool (Netrunner) or focus on memory (Stratego).

RATING: 8.5
Never got a chance to play this in its earlier, Greek-themed incarnation, but I am really enjoying the card play, the Challenges, the different abilities you can use when making them, and that streamlined, simple-to-teach head to head feeling where you have to make careful decisions each round. The artwork on this edition is killer, I love the Norse mythology and am always happy to have more games based in it, and there is just enough theme trickling through to make that worthwhile.

Light war game with some strategies but luck is a big part of the game. If you can get good cards out and keep your main card in the deck, then you should win. I rather play Hero Realms or Battle line as there is more strategy in these 2 players games.

RATING: 10
Played the game twice. First time was learning, second time was for real. I really enjoy games like this. When you get to know the deck, and the powers of your cards, it really becomes an interesting game. Take the time after playing for the first time to take a faction deck, separate it and read each of the cards (or groups of cards, as some cards have several  of each in a deck). Easy mechanisms, good tension. Fun to play.

[January 2017 - 7.3]
Decent little two-player game. The start feels a little tit-for-tat in that you're sort of setting things up and burning cards as you prepare for the main event, which comes more in the middle of the game. That's when you can start playing more guessing games with your opponent, figuring out a strategy and laying traps. Depending on when the ring and crown come out, games can feel like they run too short, or a little too long. Still, it's a fun filler.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

In the same vein as 'Fields of Glory' and Battleline but has enough different to warrant having this as well.

Great art.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
You have to approach a game like T&L with a grain of salt.  It's got some strategic depth, but it's highly tempered by the random chaos of the card shuffle.  If you ever manage to cripple an opponent's column, that player has all, but lost as it's quite easy to combo cards long enough to always deny them an action point.

In the end, this is a fun little distraction and taken as a distraction, you'll get a lot out of it.  This is the kind of game you whip out at the end of the night for that one straggler who doesn't want to go home (or you are the straggler yourself).  This is not a game you want to study or master; it just doesn't demand it.

Some criticisms: The wooden pieces, while nice, are completely useless and the card text is vague beyond reason.  These are oversized table-eating cards that have PLENTY of room to explain what a card does.  Instead, the vague, ambiguous text will have you rifling through the rulebook index just to understand how a card is properly used.  A little bit more thinking into the overall graphic design here would have helped the game by miles.

Short version: Good, fun, but don't stress yourself over it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Tactical two-player, with flavors or Stratego, Summoner Wars, maybe a pinch of Magic. I like it much better than all of those. The game definitely rewards familiarity with the deck, so give it several plays before passing judgement. For those concerned about a run-away leader, you'll discover tactics to cope and to even avoid.

The newest edition is a great UI improvement: having the abilities right on the card is a no-brained and the whole reason I kept putting off playing Hera was feeling like I needed to remember all the cards. Just a dumb design decision in Hera.

So, now that I've played...it's a very straightforward game that plays quickly. It may even be the quickie, finite version of the Netrunner I've been looking for (hidden cards, discovery/challenge, concealing assets). You can get hosed by early draws but I think there's enough to mitigate any bad luck in the game.

Overall, great little filler that scratches a Netrunner itch (for me).

This game is really interesting.  Your first play through you are looking at the cards and asking yourself "is that good".  Then you play it at the wrong time only to realize later that there was an opportune time to play that card.  The more plays against an opponent the more deep this game can become.  Also, symmetrical sides are really nice.

In Thunder & Lightning, players take on the role of Thor or Loki and fight their way through an army in an epic mythological showdown. Because Loki has already stolen Odin's Crown, the Allfather has entrusted his son Thor with his prized ring of power, Draupnir, to help him defeat the vile trickster. But who really has what it takes to gain control over both relics and therefore claim the throne of Asgard?

BAD 2 player card game. The theme and graphical style is good, but the gameplay is very very  shallow compared to other 2 player card games. Luck is an important factor and most actions you take or cards you hide are rather obvious to an attentive opponent. The 2 decks are also exactly the same and most cards are rather boring. The descriptions on some of the cards also often don't reflect the description in the rulebook. Also a bit unbalanced because of the artifact that could be at the top of your deck if you're unlucky. Multiple rows and size of cards also take up more space than needed. Not recommended for couples.

RATING: 9
My wife and I love Hera and Zeus.  I did not think changing mythologies and art would make an improvement.

I was wrong.

The new abilities on some of these cards completely changes up strategies that worked so well in Here and Zeus.  The introduction of some "guided missile" cards also presents players with a constant set of unease, as goal cards, once discovered, become sitting ducks rather than a prize that can be kept juuuuuust out of reach of the opponent.

They knocked it out of the park with this reimplementation, and the only reason I am still holding onto my copy of Hera and Zeus is the nostalgia.

Might as well be called War: The Spatial Card Game. Not only are the sides almost completely symmetric, but this is just a game of comparing hidden values to see which cards are higher. There are some cards that allow you to manipulate rows and things, but nothing all that interesting.

Players deploy their cards in a secret formation and use their cards abilities to view and fight their opponents cards. The decks are similar but different for each side. Find your opponent's Thor or Loki card to win. My opponent particularly liked the hiding and bluffing aspects of the game. To me it's necessary to understand the card types well to get full game value. It seems like a good game but just not my thing.

Not sure about this one yet.  It gets a good press but has not really grabbed us in a way to make us excited.  For being a couple of packs of cards it does a good job, but it takes a lot of space and turning the cards over is on the fiddly side.  On the cusp of being culled but needs another play or two before we decide.

[b]Thunder and Lightning[/b] was sold via auction 10/15/16.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6 -> 4)[/COLOR]

[i]My son and I enjoyed our initial plays, but as I initially thought there is a severe lack of variety in T&L and the game became stagnant. The deck's are exactly the same which was a disappointment out of the gate and after we played a bunch of games there just wasn't much there to draw us back. It took me some time to figure out why this bothered me in T&L and not a game like Battle Line and I think it is because T&L relies heavily on the special powers of cards and they really aren't that interesting and instead make the randomness of the card draw feel more pronounced since there are very specific cards to balance other cards. The lack of diversity hurts this game. If I want a more streamlined game with some special power cards I'll play [thing=760][/thing] and if I am looking for a game with a lot of varying powers, abilities and counters I'll play [thing=178892][/thing].[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]- Beautiful artwork, but a lot of the cards use the same artwork for both decks.
- Cards that can be helpful at one point in the game can come back and bite you later on (I'm looking at you shield wall).
- Card management is extremely important, in some ways it reminds me of Summoner Wars. On the one hand you want a lot of cards out but at the same time if you can easily lose if you burn through your deck to quickly.
- There isn't a ton of variety in the cards, some have special powers but overall it doesn't feel as expansive as other card games.

I'm not really sure where I stand with this game. I've had fun playing it with my son, but I have a feeling it's going to get repetitive fast compared to some other card games we play (like RftG, VS 2PCG). I was hoping the two different decks would be asymmetrical, but they are not. My son enjoys the game so we'll get some more plays in and the game may continue to surprise me by offering more diversity in game play than it first appears to have. It'll be interesting to revisit this one in a year.[/i]

The theme fits much better than with [i]Hera and Zeus[/i], IMO. The artwork is much much better, too. Excellent reprint, retheme, and reimplementation.

2-player Hand-Management Take-That Bluffing Game. This Richard Borg game is a pleasure to play. Clever and colorful 2-player card game which takes about 30+ minutes. Interesting feel to this one; I love the mechanisms mixed with the Norse Mythological theme. I think the mix of tactics, strategy, and luck are even. Mild learning curve as you learn what your options are and feel out the strategies, but it's worth the light effort. Rulebook could be better.

I enjoy this game. My gaming wife does not.

Some players have said that this game reminds them of Stratego. Though I have never played Stratego, I have to believe that this game stands on its own.

Really enjoying this game. My girlfriend always wants to play it. It plays pretty smoothly. I didn't find the specific card rulings very difficult to understand. Took 1 play to get that out of the way, and plays buttery smooth for us. I'm amazed at how different the tactics can be from game to game, out of a deck of 50 cards. I enjoy the not knowing what your opponent has laid out, the searching for that game winning card to capture, or potentially obliterating your opponent's army to win the game. for how simple it is, it feels like a world of possibilities to me.

This was an interesting game. It seemed really balanced and the power went back and forth throughout the game. Possibly a little bit of luck can cause a "worse" player to win with a good random draw. There can be some very cool strategies associated with the mechanics of this game. We did have to reference the rule book and cheat sheet about the cards pretty frequently and still had questions that we made our best guesses on at the time.

RATING: 8
Really fun take on the Stratego.

I'll go ahead and say that I like another Stratego-inspired game more, Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation (I give it a 10), but this one is still good.

The thing that I like about this game (and The Confrontation) is the number of crazy situations that can play out in any game. Maybe somebody gets lucky on their second turn and finds your key item and wins the game. Or maybe it comes down to the final few cards, fighting back and forth to find the right card. It's a perfect balance between luck and smart play.

There are a couple of possible flaws with the game.

One is that you can be at a big advantage if your key item just happens to be near the bottom of your deck. It's completely safe there. Your opponent will have to be moving his key item around to keep it hidden, possibly wasting good cards and actions to do so, while you're safe because there are very few cards that target your deck.

Another is that sometimes a player can get a good action advantage and limit their opponent to one action per round, making it not very fun for the opponent. You get as many actions as you have columns of cards, up to three, so you can keep killing off your opponent's columns to limit them significantly. I've been on both sides of that situation. This can almost feel like a runaway leader situation because one person will keep taking a full turn of three actions while the other person just does one thing. I'm almost inclined to play that you always get three actions, or maybe a minimum of two just to avoid the situation where you just have one action.

Also, the "crazy situations" I mentioned can occasionally result in an unwinnable game. I just happened to draw a hand full of support cards in one game, so it was only a matter of time before my opponent decimated my battlefield because I didn't have enough units to put into play. This was exceptionally bad luck, though, because you only have one or two copies of most of the support cards versus up to five copies of different types of units.

The price is also a bit of an issue. Z-Man included two wooden blocks that serve no purpose, and they put the game into a larger-than-needed box so they could charge a higher MSRP. This is essentially just two decks of cards and isn't worth the going price.

Despite that, I'm keeping my relatively high rating because the game is just fun and unpredictable.

Clever and enjoyable re-imaging of Stratego.  Takes all the good bits of it and works an action management system around it with a better playtime.

Runs a bit long, and seems maybe a touch too dependent on luck? I liked it though, and need to give it a few more plays before I decide if it's a keeper.

Very fun two player take that card game with bluffing. Very back and forth. Easy to learn. The art is okay. The components are solid. Lots of luck with card draw.

great strategoish game, and I love the theme of thor and lokey. Some people complain that it is a bit long for 2 players, but I still think it is an awesome game.

Great two player card game that plays like a tense stratego variant. I love it. If you like The Lord of the Rings: Confrontation you'll like this.

RATING: 6.5
Area control with market manipulation and tile-laying.

Each turn you either place workers (which are VERY limited) or build a building, using the building cards in your hand.  The cards have a colour, which is significant for scoring, and a building type, which can also be significant for scoring.

Once a building has been completely surrounded, scoring chits are paid out to whoever is around the building (think Australia here).  Then the player who initiates the building closure can manipulate the market so to speak, and CHOOSE if he/she wants to score.  You only have 4 times you can score during the game, so choosing when to score can be difficult.  Game ends after all of one market type are finished, plus one more round.

Overall, I was slightly disappointed with this game only because Dorn's previous games (Louis XIV, Goa) rank among my all-time favourite games.  This is a solid if not spectacular effort.  I'm also not a huge fan of market manipulation games, but there are those games which I think do it better than this one (think Ys, Princes of the Renaissance, die Handler).  The game does seem to scale quite nicely from 2-4 players though.  Loses half a point due to poor quality cards(!!!) and scoring flags.

Fantastic abstract with lavish thematic artwork and lovely tactile pieces. It rivals Wolfgang Kramer's mask trilogy for strategic area-control fun and ease of play. The small element of speculation is an added bonus (when should I cash in my points - will prices go up or down?). A lovely design and under-rated.

Juego muy bonito que parece familiar pero esconde una amplia gestión del espacio, tiempo y dinero que hace pensar lo suyo.
Mezcla de juego de gestión espacial, por colocación trabajadores y de edificios a lo tetris (principes de florencia) junto con juego económico y gestión de multiplicadores de puntos (torres del castillo) y tiempos de cúando usarlos.
Muyy chulo, ideal con 3, recomendado para 2 también.

Really enjoyed this game.  It is quite abstract, but it's a lot of fun.  There could be a tendency towards AP with the wrong players, but providing you're intolerant of that as a group and play a reasonably fast game, this is good.

Lots of choices.  Elements of Princes of Florence and Samurai, whilst some of the pieces reminded me of Africa.

I am very pleasantly surprised at how much my 8 year old daughter enjoys this game.  She very carefully considers which card to take and which color of the castle to build.

RATING: 8
An enjoyable building/market game.  There are a few dynamics at work that interact in interesting ways.  There's a construction side in placing and completing new buildings.  There's a stock market angle for turning in banners and seals.  There are a number of strategic elements including placement of castle pieces, timing for turning in banners, timing for completing buildings, and more.

The above elements combine to form a game that is more than the sum of its parts.  The different dynamics work together very well to provide a game that can be surprisingly interesting.  It's not the deepest of games, but there are always a number of options and considerations.

I rather enjoy this one.  Could go to a 9, but I don't think it holds my interest enough, or is deep enough.

RATING: 5
I enjoyed this game. I think it's probably best with 3, because at 4 I didn't feel like I could execute a grand strategy due to big changes to the board between turns.

RATING: 7
Okish, not great -- if Arkadia were slightly lighter, it'd get more play, and be higher rated by me, but as it is, it isn't as good as Dorn's best.  It's also a little, well, dull, then not at all dull.  Strange structure, where we end up "setting up" the game over a long and rather boring period, getting neutrals, then the end-game where the action takes place happens very fast.  Not so light -- hard to feel as if your choices are anywhere near right!

Interesting, though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Build properties in ArKadia and then surround them with people/buildings to earn seals. Complete buildings and build central palace. Placement of parts on central palace decides value of seals at any point in the game. Try to sell seals when at highest value to earn most money that wins game. Quick game where as usual you do not have enough time to do everything you want to do. Enjoyable game.

My first game (2 players) was just OK. But I could see the potential for more interactive play (we built on opposite sides of the board for most of the game). I'd like to give this another go, especially with more players.

NEED MORE PLAYS!

Initial thoughts: This game is interesting for two reasons.

1.) The economic nature of the game is completely based on an abstract and spatial understanding. We're not manipulating markets and speculating on prices, but then again, we are! The way in which the game interacts with the markets is refreshing because of the way that the prices visually fluctuate based on castle piece placement. I can honestly say I've not played a game like it.

2.) The idea that scoring comes for every player at a different point in the game, and even more than that, you CHOOSE when you want to score! That adds an element of timing into the game that is superb!

With such a short play time it's hard to believe that this game can add so many meaningful and satisfying decisions.

The game is essentially about making the best use of your quite limited resource of own coloured men to maximise your earnings in the highest paying seals and to manipulate their value through placing blocks in the big central building. It aspires to be a thinker yet has few interesting decisions and nothing in the way of player interaction or fun factor to compensate.

Anyway, decent enough game which seems like it suffers from a strong/weak adjacent player syndrome.

RATING: 6.5
This is a tough game to evaluate.  The mechanics are good and the components (except the banner flags) are likewise good.  The problem (if there is one) seems to be with setting up the other players for big scores.  Unlike some games, you do not set up the player to your left, but 2 or even 3 to your left.  This means you have to look at the player 2 or 3 to your right for the best moves to capitalize on (which is not obvious).  The player to your immediate right may tempt you into taking a move, but the payoff will likely not be yours.  The net result of this effect is that it is easy for a player to get left behind completely because they do not see this.  This is not a fault of the game, but it can leave the odd player out with a unpleasant game experience.  For the players that are in the running the game scores are likely to be very tight and they will likely enjoy the game.  The disparity in the players' reactions is the biggest drawback to the game.

It's a nice game, with great components, and a very straightforward mechanic. Easy to teach, and really hard to master. The problem is this last part: it's a bit counter-intuitive at times, and other player's actions, while everything is open information, can really become a bit chaotic.

Probably needs more plays, though. I might raise the rating in the future...

UPDATE: I don't know if I finally got it or not. I'm doing better in the game recently, but as I do, my enjoyment declines. The Tetris-like building mechanic is great, but the worker placement and the "stock-like" scoring system is not so (at least for me). I'll play it once in a while, but it's definitely out of my wish list. Down to a 6.

UPDATE: Definitely not my cup of tea. I might play when people really want to, but I would never again "want to". Down to a 4.

Played house rule that obsolete building cards can be discarded and replaced.  A common bugbear - that the later players potentially get fewer turns and that that can be decisive as to deciding the winner.  Most of the game is spent setting up the next player.  Nonetheless an enjoyable game.

RATING: 6
"more of the same"?  yea probably a little.  There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with Arkadia, but it doesn't shine.  There are a few familiar elements here.  It feels a bit like Princes of Florence minus the auctions.  The spacial stuff is fun, and the fluctuating value of the victory point chips is neat. 

Players compete by constructing different tetris shaped buildings around the main castle.  finished buildings let you contribute to the castle which influences how valuable your victory point chips are.

The tetris-piece buildings don't have any real character other then their shape, which is a shame.

If you're new to the hobby and are moving beyond monopoly for the first time, this isn't a bad choice.  Enthusiasts will find a challenging, engaging game with great pieces but might still be underwhelmed.

Initial rating after 2 consecutive 4-player games. A pleasant and quick game of  tactical tile and pawn placements mashed up with a fairly simple stock market. My biggest concern with the game is the potential imbalance caused by a weak player as a considerable part of the game is understanding how not to setup your left-hand neighbour (similar to Hansa, or Medina). As such, I'd probably only want to play the game with 2 or 3, and even then with equally skilled players. Despite the potential for weak-player syndrome, I did enjoy the geometric tactics and the fluidity of the stock market.

First playing.  The game is very very deep for so few rules.  It was really messing with my head and turning it into mush.  This was very surprising since the rules can be explained in only 5 minutes.  Each player has 1 to 2 actions on their turn to perform from a pool of 3 actions.  Yet, there are so many underlying levels of strategy.  The game felt very circular, which could feel like you don't know what to do.  This certainly can lead to analysis paralysis though.  Since one thing that you do on your turn can affect so many things, one can feel overwhelmed with options, even though there are only two actions.  We botched a rule.  We didn't give the player that completed a building an extra seal.  This makes a huge difference because sometimes it is worth it to close a region to set you up later and you can still get a seal for not having a worker next to that building.  At any rate, I look forward to playing this game again and playing with the real rules.

Considering its rank, I have to think that I, personally didn't like it. If it was a '90s game Ι'd give it a better rating, but for 2006 I expected more , mechanics-wise. It's too simple without having something different to offer, and it's not more fun than others of its kind.

A fine, yet not outstanding game. Sort of area control and building placement to gain markers, followed by market manipulation, and cashing in the markers at the most opportune time. Simple gameplay, more complex strategies and timing. Some screwage in the market manipulations, building and worker placements. Simpe goal...own the most gold...that's it, no tiebreakers,no VPs, just gold. Has mechanisms from a number of other games yet these blend pleasantly to form a solid game. Decent parts too..not simply wooden cubes.

It has a chance to score more in the future. A few plays later I must admit it's a good game :short, sharp and strategic.

Played once as a 4-player game.  Arkadia is very similar to Kramer's Australia.  I'm not sure which is the better game. 

Anyway, I found Arkadia mostly unsatisfying.  The most interesting choice was which colored block to place in order to get the best price for the same colored seal.  I guess that memory plays a role so that you have to keep track of what colors your opponents have heavily invested in, but other than that, there's not enough depth for me to want to play this or for that matter Australia again.  Basically, I found Arkadia to be very relaxed and casual.

{2P: ???, 3P: 9, 4P: 8}

Here we are in the new year, and I have something to confess.  No, it's not that I plan on failing in my resolution to work out more this year.  Rather, I'm experiencing a bout of Eurogame burnout.  After running into different mixtures of the same mechanics over and over again, the line between games starts to blur.  On the surface, [i]Arkadia[/i] appears to have elements of [i][thing=21790]Thurn and Taxis[/thing][/i], [i][thing=555]The Princes of Florence[/thing][/i], and [i][thing=88]Torres[/thing][/i].  That's quite the stable of excellent games, but I had my doubts about [i]Arkadia[/i]'s ability to stand on its own.

Those doubts were unfounded.  I should have more faith in [person=381]Rüdiger Dorn[/person].  The man who created [i][thing=9216]Goa[/thing][/i] and [i][thing=13642]Louis XIV[/thing][/i] is not likely to disappoint.

Blah, blah, settlers, builders, influential families, and a castle.  We've covered this ground before.  Once you get past the overused theme, [i]Arkadia[/i] really starts to shine.  There are family seals in four colors, which are essentially a commodity market.  Cards determine which buildings may be placed, and for which families.  Play a card from behind your screen, place the building, and then draw a replacement.  There are three face-up cards, or you can draw a card from the face-down pile.  This idea has seen a lot of use (as in [i][thing=21790]Thurn and Taxis[/thing][/i]) because it mitigates the luck factor.

Like [i][thing=555]The Princes of Florence[/thing][/i], the buildings themselves look like [i]Tetris[/i] pieces: they have different shapes which use a block as the atomic unit.  When a building is surrounded by other buildings or by worker figurines, then it is considered to be "completed," and a payout occurs.  Players with workers around the building earn a family seal for each one.  The player who completed the building receives the seal from it.  In this manner, you collect the commodities (family seals).  Therefore the first part of the game is about placing buildings and workers so that you maximize the number of seals you receive, while limiting the opportunities for your opponents.  There is plenty of room for player conflict, as you can either place a building, or workers, but not both in the same turn.  That familiar angst of "I wish I could do one more thing" is definitely present here.

Complete a building, and you also get to add a piece to the castle.  This step is done by placing one of the [i][thing=88]Torres[/thing][/i]-like towers on the castle's foundation board.  Each tower has a family seal seated within its crenellations.  The castle acts as a fixed-ceiling market: the number of seals of a particular color that are visible when the castle is viewed from above determine the current market value of those seals (in gold coins).  Thus, by completing buildings you earn the seals as well as the ability to adjust their value on the market.  There are only ten such spaces available; once they are all filled, then you start building on the next level.  You also have the opportunity to have a personal payout.  This step provides you with two more workers in your color, and allows you to exchange your seals for gold at the current market rate.  Early profit taking in some colors leads to long-hold strategies in others, while balancing hand management and your resource pool of workers.

There is one, final, well-worn attribute about [i]Arkadia:[/i] it is a very enjoyable game with surprising depth.  These characteristics are becoming a hallmark of [person=381]Rüdiger Dorn[/person] titles, and they are ones with which I will never get tired.

Pretty good combination of tile laying and set collection. There is however a feeling that you don't have so much influence on the outcome of the game. But maybe it's because I haven't played enough yet.

This felt like a highly tactical game of seizing the moment for everything, especially scoring.  It's also a game about not setting up others... though, sometimes you can't avoid it.  I enjoyed it enough, but it isn't exactly my type of game.

There is a lot going on with this. Balancing when to "pounce" for scoring makes for a great game. Free placement of the castle makes for unique challenges every game. We are using it for one of our Summer Tournament games.Mike Snedeker, pres.BGoR

Wow. This game is definetely underrated!

It's been down on the low end of my want list for years. Finally, someone offered me a good trade and I got it. WOW! What a cool game. This is a family game with some depth. Choosing the best 4 times to score is simply genius and makes the whole game dynamic. This game, Tabago, and Evo are my 3 favorite family games.

A very solid game, quite balanced and short enough to make good timing a key component of your strategy. Not quite a brain burner but certainly gives your brain a good warm up.

Not to be confused with a building game (or Tetris). This is a stock market game pure and simple. Also worth knowing that your key resource is your pool of architects. Use them wisely and try to use all 11 during the course of the game.

What really strikes the eye when playing Arkadia is its components: although it’s an eurogame it doesn’t make use of any wooden cubes but plastic figures. It’s all smoke in your eyes though, as it lacks a flavour of its own and this bleakness is reflected in the anonymous way the game plays. [i](February 2012)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - One of the goals I set for my Fall 2015 rating revise was to limit half-point ratings to a minimum: thus, since Arkadia isn’t one of them, I rounded down my rating from 5,5 to 5.

Well, this game surprised me.  I have owned this since it came out but finally got to play it in Oct 2014.  The turns are simple but the decision is tough.  Placement, worker placement, when to cash in for points, how fast you want to drive the game to completion. Tactical in many ways, but you have to keep an eye on how you want to see the game to end.  All stuff I just love.  I only played it two player and it really blew me away with all of that.  The game looks great, too.  Can't wait to play it again (and to play with more).

RATING: 7
Fun, but the entire thing feels constructed.  A good game flows, you almost forget that someone designed it.  Here the designer's intent is palpable.  He is, almost desperately, putting together mechanics and creating decision points and it is all very translucent.  It doesn't help that theme is absolutely abysmal.

Okay game.  Fairly abstract & brain burning... but there's enough going on that you don't notice the abstract-ness.  Very much a "waiting game" with everyone trying to avoid setting up a big score for the opposition.  Not a game that would hit my table often... especially since my wife hates starting on a wide open board (ex. Mexica & Torres)... and I dislike "waiting games" as described above.

Reminded me of Reef Encounter but quicker and lighter.  In both, you are collecting a commodity (in this case seals) and attempting to manipulate a market that will pay you lots of points for the commodities you are collecting.  What makes this different from RE is that each player decides the first four times to score his commodities based on when he thinks the market is optimum.

RATING: 9
Arkadia is a euro to the core - a set of very simple rules that produce a large and interesting decision space for the players.  Fundamentally, you have only two choices on your turn: place a building, or place workers.  On any turn, you can optionally choose to cash in the seals that you've been working hard to earn and manipulate the value of for gold (VPs).  That's the sum total of the rules.  But they create a great game experience.  

Arkadia has two elements that help create an interesting decision space.  The first is that, if you surround a building, it is "built" and rewards those whose workers touch it.  The interesting part here is that the person who completed it gets a reward too, and gets to build the castle, which manipulates the prices of the seals you're earning for building.  It is a very nice mechanism that rewards scoring others' workers with a seal and the opportunity to change the seal pricing.  That opportunity is doubly important because of the second element: limited opportunities to turn in seals for gold.  You only get 4 opportunities per game, and you only get more workers when you take those opportunities.  This makes Arkadia a game of timing your scoring as much as it is a game of earning seals.  

Combined, these two things produce some agonizing decisions.  Because it is often better to score other players' workers and control seal pricing than it is to score your own workers.  There's something of a spatial puzzle built in too, because you want to place your workers based on the buildings you will be able to put around them.  And you want to use your buildings to pick up neutral workers as well, since they help you finish buildings.

After 5 plays, I think this is a gem of a game.  It is easy to teach, but difficult to master.  It plays well with 3 as well as 4 (haven't tried 2).  Most people we have introduced to it do poorly, but leave wanting to try it again.  This is a mostly tactical game with a layer of larger strategy involving predicting which seals will be worth more in future turns.  There is significant player driven uncertainty, so this is not well suited for those who need to control their destiny.  But it is a very good 60 minute euro experience.

I find it unoriginal and don't feel the need neither to buy or to play it again; it's a mix between Samurai and Dschunke. I don't like game in which you have to think at your best move and, at the same time, a move that doesn't give an advantage to the player at your left. Towers have only an esthetical function and I was disapppointed in discovering that you can place them in fixed spots (and not spread them on the entire board).

I really get a kick out of this game! Though players only have one of two options per turn (place a building or place workers), there is a surprising amount of strategic depth present. Also, I think that the stock market mechanism (and the ability to cash in your "stocks" a maximum of four times during the game) creates some very interesting tensions.

Note: so far, I've played with 2 and 3 players, and I think it scales well in that range (though they each have a distinct feel).

Pretty neat quasi-abstract game that's relatively easy to learn, though I imagine much room for improvement with multiple plays. Your building/worker placements require a lot of bluffing and distraction so that you don't set up your opponent for a big score. The scoring mechanism is also interesting, favoring certain colors earlier in the game and others later. You'll often find yourself helping an opponent complete a building just so you can depreciate the value of a color they've gone for.

OK game.  I like the tile placement and the element of trying to set yourself up for big scores.  There's not a lot of excitement to the game, though.  Seems to plod along rather methodically.

TRADED AWAY.  This may be a thinly veiled abstract, but it's a good one. It plays in about 45 minutes with 2 players and it's tense throughout. Do I trigger scoring now or push my luck?  There are always multiple good choices and many options. I suspect that the game might drag out with AP players, but neither me nor my wife care to maximize our moves. We just play for the fun of it. Excellent.

UPDATE: I've kicked the rating up to an 8, because I think Arkadia is actually a rather clever game, and there are interesting tensions and both tactical and strategic tradeoffs. It's also just the right length and a clean system.

But there is no theme here; it's a prototypical soulless eurogame, which is actually surprising given that Herr Dorn's previous games have been fairly well-themed (especially Jambo and Traders of Genoa, although the recent Robber Knights was similarly bereft). The themelessness may ultimately mean Arkadia is not a keeper. But I'm enjoying it for the moment.
---
Played once. The play of the game is interesting, reminds my simultaneously of Reef Encounter and Samurai. Like Samurai, you score points by surrounding things, and it has that "don't open up anything for the player on your left" combined with trying maneuver into power-plays using scarce, strong pieces, as well as watching for the opportunities to get cheap scores off of other players' moves. It's also got the bit from Reef encounter where the players compete to make certain colors worth more or less when scoring comes around.

What BvA adds that's new is the players' ability to time their cashing out of scoring pieces (gained from surrounding) for points; you can score your pieces on your turn if you think conditions are favorable, to a limit of 4 times a game. This is clever and adds some tension.

Technically, I think the only drawback to BvA might be that the timing of scoring somewhat overshadows the onboard play of surrounding and gaining scoring chips. The interesting bit of BvA is the tactical play, and not so much the mini-game to see if Red will be worth more than Green; that part is a bit simplistic and so should have a more minor role in the game than what it does in my opinion. Also, for me personally this just feels like a somewhat bloated version of Knizia's Samurai. Samurai strikes many of the same notes, decision-making-wise, but does it in a far cleaner, more elegant, and more attractive package.

But, where BvA really crashes for me is on theming. There is absolutely no theme here at all; it's a total paste-up. This would have been better shipped as an abstract, I think, going the route of Einfach Genial. When a game claims to have a theme, and yet there is absolutely no connection between theme and game, it is always jarring for me. I think the interlocking pieces of BvA, the decisions you make (which mostly involve fairly short-term tactical stuff, avoiding setting up your opponents while looking out for your own possibilities to make power-plays) are good - I like games where you can set up big plays. But this sort of game needs to supply a theme to have legs; if I just wanted the intellectual challenge, I'd play Go (or something). But I don't, I want some flavor, some roleplaying; not a lot, maybe, but at least some. Near as I can tell, BvA provides none whatsoever, zero, zilch. And so it gets whacked several points by me. Even Knizia's Samurai, which I consider abstract-ish, has decent elements of theme as well, so again BvA suffers in comparison.

This is my first genuine disappointment from Rudiger Dorn. I played on a friend's copy, and looking around, this is looking like a $50 price point, and honestly, I don't think it's worth it. After the wonderful Jambo, Traders of Genoa, Goa, and Louis XIV, Baumeister von Arcadia is flat and lifeless.

Pretty neat twist on a market system.  Place your workers around buildings to collect seals, and then mess with the market to make your seals worth the most gold.

Timing is really the key to this game, as deciding when to influence the market and when to cash in your seals for gold will really make or break your game.

Overall, a very good medium-weight game

Modern set collection game where you choose when to score independently from others.  Most older set collection has a somewhat predictable yet still a surprise (Alhambra, Queen's Necklace, and Union Pacific) scoring system.  Arkadia you choose when to score.

A very interesting game about gaining seals and cashing them in for the most money possible. Build buildings and place workers who get paid off in seals for their part in completing the building.

Arkadia is a fine but not spectacular game. It’s a classic eurogame with brownish components and a nearly non-existing theme – but that doesn’t matter to me at all. As long as the mechanics are fine, it’s all good. The gameplay is so simple as you either place a building on the board or place workers around buildings! If I didn’t know better I would have thought that it was designed by Knizia as the gameplay and scoring is so simple. You constantly manipulate the values of the various color buildings and try to cash in on them when they are worth the most – no easy feat as your opponents also try to do the same and you probably don’t collect the same values. 

The spatial element of placing tetris-shaped buildings on the board is a whole other game in the game, and you need to place your workers in a clever way so they touch as many buildings as possible, but your opponents can once again thwart your plans.

The game doesn’t last long, about an hour, and if you’re sneaky you can actually end the game suddenly and catch your opponents off guard – it’s awesome when this happens! Arkadia is a simple game with easy rules and a simple scoring mechanism, but there is definitely a lot of strategy hiding beneath the surface in this game.

Standard euro fare. A city building/stock exchange game which didn't really grab me. The palace building/seal value mechanic is neat. Very quick playing so it is important to use all four of your banners to get more workers fairly quickly and to cash in any seals worth probably four or more at that time.

This one has a lot of elements that I really enjoy about games - too much to do in too little time, nice components, shifting evaluations (yet no auction!), little luck, easy to explain with juicy decisions, and the right balance between the tactical (closing off buildings, when to cash in) and the strategic (which seals to seek out,the castle).  My one concern is that it may lack an appropriate depth - but more plays will reveal that.

The more I play the less I like it.  There are some clever well developed ideas here undone by a relatively mediocre right/left bound help-your-neighbour-help-you-score game.  Amusing if tired and prone to degenerate play.

Update: It is too easy to setup loss leading opportunities in which you will score heavily and each other player will heavily lose relative position if they attempt to stop you.  The result is a mesh of degenerate strategies which rapidly result in either a runaway winner or one player sacrificing themselves into last place in order to prevent the runaway winner.

In a strange way, Baumeister von Arkadia reminds me a lot of Kramer's Australia but with a bit more calculation and an added money economy.

Players are trying in this game to surround buildings with either other buildings or with their very finite pool of people. Buildings each have an associated colour, and when they are scored (surrounded), each player receives one chip of the building's colour for each man they have present on the edge of that buildings. The player who triggers that scoring also gets a bonus chip, and gets to place a piece on the score board which changes the values of the chips. At the end of any player's turn, they can cash in any or all of their chips for the value shown on the face, that is your victory points. The trick is that you can only do that 4 times voluntarily, and once at the end of the game.

So this is a game of surrounding stuff, getting chips for doing so, and then changing those chips into VPs. Much like Australia, it seems to be a game of "A-ha!", where leaving behind opportunities for the other players can be a real crippler. This game occupies the medium weight ground, it is fairly easy to pick up and play, but it does offer some interesting decisions over the course of a game. It is also short, around an hour, which is a nice plus in its favour.

I liked this one, I like games that have that moment of ephiphany, and this certainly has that in spades. This is probably too basic for me to ever move up its ratings, but it is also enjoyable enough where I doubt the rating will go down. This is a textbook 7 for me.

Számomra a tökéletes taktikai társasjáték, akár 2-en, 3-an, vagy 4-en játszunk vele. Én nagyon szeretem, bár egyszerű és elsőre nem is tűnik olyan hú de nagyon stratégiai játéknak.

Beszerzése után játszottunk egyet-kettőt vele (akciós volt csak ez motivált, és a Carcassonne alapjátékkal rendeltük meg, tehát fél évig süllyedt aztán a polcon), de miután újra előkerült felfedeztük értékeit. A csapatból én szeretem legjobban, remek játék.

A very good family game but just a bit too complex for SdJ IMHO.  I really like the scoring mechanic.  Bits are excellent and it is a fun game with lots of depth and replay value.  The scoring and think-ish-ness / Depth of strategy may have kept it from being the SdJ winner.  My 7-1/2 yr old did win our first game but it took a lot of advice from dad to pick up on the concepts.  This game is a solid 9.75, but not a 10.  Purchased 7-5-07 Thanks Thought Hammer.

Number of plays slightly low. This is multiplayer tetris style tile laying to earn `stock' that you have to trade in at various times.

Area majority multiplayer tetris-> stock market manipulation. I like the idea a lot more than I like the actual game, which is too light for my tastes.

RATING: 6
After many eons I found myself sitting behind this game again. The first time I played it I was a green rookie, able to compare games in terms of major titles only, and looking back at that comment made me shake my head a lot to the point where I decided that the comment should be completely rewritten.

The game itself is surprisingly tricky for a family game. Ravensburger haven't put out something of this level since, instead focussing on simpler titles like Celtica and Asara. It becomes quite clear once you take the reigns: Arkadia is a game of topological area control coupled to a simple stock market scheme. The idea is that players put down buildings and mark these with a seal (which is really a share of sorts); then they try to enclose these buildings with meeples or other buildings. The player to enclose a building gets the previously placed seal plus an amount equal to the number of his own meeples in contact with the building. Other players get seals for their meeples too. For every building enclosed the player then takes a Torres-like tower block and places it in a central square; when viewed from above a number of coloured dots becomes visible, with the number of dots indicating the seal's value. Four times per game he can exchange the collected seals for money at the current market price; a fifth time is when the game ends. Most money wins.

The game is, as I stated, tricky. For one thing the placement rules of buildings and such means that you want to create structures where your meeples touch as many buildings as possible. This gives you the highest amount of seals and thus money. On the other hand you cannot place a building and immediately enclose it: other players have to take their turn first before that is possible. This means you cannot leave a too tempting a scoring opportunity, for they might decide it's worth their rare meeples to claim things before you can. This topological balancing act is not easy, and a player going for long term investments may catch up in a major and surprising way. Then there is some left-right binding to consider when dealing with the ‘stock market’ or castle as the game calls it. You want to follow the player on your right for he is then unable to harm you without harming himself. But the downside is that a scoring opportunity [i]you[/i] set up might also be good for [i]him[/i], leading to an uneasy balance which can change in a matter of one or two game rounds. The combination of mechanics is seldomly seen in a family title.

Yet the game has some rough spots as well. A player can do very little but place his men and buildings; and he is quite dependent on the randomness in the building cards which tell him what type of building, and of what colour, he can erect that round. I'm not sure what that drafting mechanic is present; probably to prevent players from maximising enclosures which would render the game significantly same-y over time. Still, it stings a little that a small building is worth the same amount of seals as a large one, and that you have little choice in the matter.

All in all I think the game is significantly better than my memory led me believe; but at the same time I think it isn't quite good enough to be purchased. Still, I won't say no to a few more games to see how the strategies and tactics pan out; and that is not a comment I make often.

Played this once as a four player game.  It seemed enjoyable enough that I'm going to keep my copy.  I'll come back to it again and decide on it in the future.

That being said, I'm obviously not itching to play it again RIGHT away.  Seems to be a good family game, but my family needs to age a bit yet to enjoy this. 

Reaquired April 2010.  Now that my copy is no longer in shrink, we'll see if this gets played.

May 2010 - Played with group.  Bit of AP going on, but not too bad once things started moving.  Need to try this out on wife and family to see if it has staying power.  Going to start rating out at about 7.  Starting to enjoy this game.

This is the original German version: Die Baumeister von Arkadia.  Rating is after three two-player games, one game each with three and four players.  Very much enjoy the game and am thrilled to see that it plays well with two players.  Trying to balance the need to gain workers versus winning seals and trying to do so without giving your opponent easy opportunities for earning seals is the crux of this game.  It is a game filled with moments where you are just so sure that there must be a better move than what you are considering.  Agonizing moments.  This is good.  Am looking forward to seeing how this one stands the test of time.

Combines interesting, meaningful positioning with a really neat market mechanic and some resource management, all very well tied together.

I make sure to warn new players that endgame arrives more rapidly than they might expect, since the second round goes faster than the first. As banners generally give their greatest benefit before the final turn or two, this is something to watch out for.

[EDIT: I have to face the fact that while I enjoy this game, I don't feel nearly as much of a draw to play it as my original rating suggested. The game also gives a strong advantage to playing after someone who's made a mistake, since it's possible to set other players up very well. Downgraded.]

Components: Nice towers, but the game doesn't make good use of them, opting instead to just stack them all in the center. All around well made, but without being beautiful.

Experience: Very strange. There are some interesting choices about how to play my people efficiently, and when to cash in, but the ever-changing values of the seals is very difficult (in an unsatisfying way) to strategize around. I didn't feel I could plan more than a move in advance.

Players use builders, cards, workers, and neutral workers to build houses in Arkadia. Houses are built with the seal of one of 4 families; this family gave the building order and will get the building player its seal.These seals can be changed for victory points. But seals are subject to changing values. The growing castle (every time a house is built, players also build on the castle) has the 4 seals on it as well, which decides the value of each seal. The castle is also the game's timer: once the second layer is built, the last round starts. The player with the most gold wins.

It's difficult to help yourself in this game because you need a turn to place a building and then another turn to surround it. Meanwhile, your opponents likely will take advantage of your set-up before you get the chance to. So, the game devolves into avoiding a play that may aid your opponents and into co-opting what they (particularly the player immediately before you) have done.

There's a whole bunch of games coming out lately that have a rather polished and well thought out gameplay mechanics, but the theme always feels completely pasted on and playing the game feels just like following some arbitrary (usually not even very simple) rules.  Arkadia is one of them.  The theme is lame: you need to enclose a building, thus getting some kind of seal, which you then sell, getting money according to the colour of the building.  See what I mean?  So, the game works as intended, but I would rather play something else.

Pretty good game.  Feels a little like a puzzle where you are trying to fit a piece (or men) in just the right spot that scores you the most points/coins.  So be warned, the game is prone to a bit of AP as each player tries to optimize his move.  For some reason, the game feels a little like Reef Encounter to me.  We got some rules wrong on our first play.  I expect to like it even more once it hits the table again.

RATING: 6
Players place builders and buildings onto a gridded game board, to try and claim building seals.  Thoughtful placement game where buildings are placed onto the board, and completed when surrounded orthoganally by other buildings or builders.  Seals are paid out for completed buildings, one per builder surrounding them with a bonus for the player who finished it.  Seals are cashed in at opportune times for coins (i.e. victory points).  Nice game, feels very much like Samurai by Knizia, where you hope the player on your right is a dunce and will hand you nice plays.  Happy to play it, and happy to not own it!

My first impression didn't do a lot for me. At first blanch it seems like a bland little tile-placing exercise that lets you score in a stock game. For me this fell into the heap of forgettable tactical games like Attika. 
 
Furthermore, the vibe of trying to avoid setting up the next player for a good move, when coupled with the tile-placing-to-capture, just gives me flashbacks to Knizia's Samurai. I find Samurai to be more strategic, more charming, and easier to understand what I'm doing and why.

My brain hasn't tingled like this since the first time I played Tigris & Euphrates.  It's not quite T&E, but still very very good so far.

UPDATE Nov 2014: My tastes in games must really be changing.  I thought I loved this game, but I recently revisited it after not playing it for a few years, and did not dig it much at all.  The gameplay seems to be an exercise in NOT setting up your opponent, which is not a style of play I typically enjoy, although I do still really like Samurai which has a similar vibe.  With two players Arkadia is quite deterministic, and with more it's entirely tactical.  Not for me anymore.

This one was my pick for the 2007 SdJ and though I was happy to see Schacht win, I will probably get this game to the table as much, if not more, than Zooloretto.  It scales quite well for 2-4 players, so Shelley and I can play it together when we're looking for a 30 minute game.  The development of the castle is beautiful, and as the men sprinkle around the board you're left with some nice eye candy on the table.  I enjoy the choices of when to score - sometimes just to get the guys you need - and like the strategies of when to block scoring in a color.

This game is all about timing and tactics. The values of the seals you hold in your hand constantly fluctuate, and it's important to take advantage of opportunities when they arise. It definitely isn't a "hoard the resources until the end" kind of game.  Because of the modular placement of the buildings, every game is different; and it takes a little bit to understand how to properly use your workers to maximize their positioning. 

Arkadia also rewards the player who's willing to share a few points in the short run in order to more effectively control the game later on. You have to be thoughtful, aggressive, and crafty--all elements for an enjoyable gaming experience. It plays in under and hour and doesn't ever drag. Arkadia is best with 3 players, but also works well with 4. I don't think it would be that great of a 2-player game since there would be much less pressure involved in scoring seals, which is a big chunk of the game's enjoyment.

I have to make special mention of the box insert. It's wonderfully designed; each component has a home and the pieces don't fall out if you turn the box on its side. I think it's one of the best-designed inserts I've seen (along with Jamaica and perhaps Pillars of the Earth).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Arkadia would be a very simple game of tile placement if not for the clever variable scoring mechanic. Each player to complete a building may also choose value or devalue one of the four scoring tokens. Players have four opportunities to cash in tokens before the end of the game. Deciding how to valuate the tokens and the best time to cash in is what makes this game shine.

This game is far simpler than the components would first suggest. However, "simple" is in rules complexity only. Great combination tile laying/stock market game that forces a player to carefully share areas as well as control it to ensure other players don't devalue their seals.

No es tan malo como lo pinto... y el concepto económico del castillo central no es para nada malo, sin embargo creo que el hecho de que te dan muy pocos constructores de tu color y la mecánica en que se construyen los edificios no es la más entretenida u original...

What is this ? Too complicated for a family game, too less strategy for the serious gamer. One element which I dislike: you set a tile on the board with a plan in your mind, trying to fulfill it in your next turn. If the plan is good, others will do it for you, and this happens toujours...

Was disgusted they used the same pieces as Torres.  It made Torres less special, and this one seem cheaper.  That aside, it is a good game and I enjoyed playing it--I liked playing it with a full compliment of opponents--can't image it would be as much fun with fewer players.

I've only played twice but I was impressed at how good it was two player.  I thought it was good three player as well.  It's always nice to find a good two player euro with great production and a nice depth to it.  I'm not wild about the 'choose when to score' thing. I prefer a euro where the game structure handles the scoreing timing instead of me. Worring about when to score is too stressful and overshadows the rest of the game.  

I'm not sure why I feel sort of 'ho-hum' about it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Something just keeps bringing me back to this game.  It took a play or two to realize it but the game is really a commodity speculation game.  At first you view the game in terms of shapes of buildings and maximizing the seals you can get, but after a bit you'll start collecting cards for specific colors and playing specific colors of cards on other players.  

The game is all about figuring out how the seal values are going to fluctuate and trying to ride those shifts to victory.  In that regard there's a lot of symbiotic play and trade-offs between control over the shifts, and maximizing seals.  

The extra tension between cashing in your banners for workers as early as possible and holding off on them to try and sell particular seals for maximum profit is a very nice touch.  It's one of those games I categorize as "light" but I'm always intrigued by the play almost as if I were playing something quite heavier.

A fun area control type game. It looks older than it really is. The components are nice as the towers really give the game a unique look and feel.

The best part of the game is that you get to decide when you want to score and then manipulating the market. Area control games are not my favorite games but this is one of the better ones out there.

Dorn's new game. Blend of area majority with stock holding and currency conversion. Looks great. (Of course it does, it's a Ravensburger production.) Only downside are the cheap-looking plastic figures. They should have stuck with wooden pawns. Oh well, no one's perfect. I can toss the figs and replace with wooden cubes or pawns myself. On radar, and watching closely.

Terrific game!  OK, OK, it is way too over-produced, but the bits really lend an element of immersion.  Simple rules.  Groovy interaction.  Painful choices.

This will likely soon turn into one of my favorites.

Négyesben sajnos nem annyira jó. Túl nagy a káosz és a kiszámíthatatlanság. Simán lehet 30 pontokat veszteni egy kör alatt, anélkül, hogy különösebb hatásod lenne a dolgok folyására. Érzésem szerint hárman lehet a legjobb, de azt még ki kell próbálni, nomeg sajna aránylag ritka játékosszám. Így valszeg marad a 8-as értékelés.

PRO - Not quite like any other game I've played to this point.  Seems to be a good amount of depth there and I think all the mechanics tie in together quite nicely. A lot of decisions to be made each turn even though actions are limited.

There are certainly games with more depth than Arkadia, but for the few solid share holding games out there, I'm putting Arkadia at the top. A game that squeezes out tension and allows for moments of ingenious play through its rather simple mechanics. An all around a solid game. Tastefully overproduced.  A rare stock game that works very well with 2 players, in addition to 3 and 4. Another winner for Dorn!

Arkadia is a wonderful quick stock/ area control hybrid.  In a lot of ways this feels similar to Acquire but streamlined and played at a faster clip.  Decisions for building, placement of workers, and cashing in seals all require perfect timing.  An excellent choice for three or four players. Trails only Traders as my favorite Dorn design.

Update:  Doesn't take long for moods to change with me.  I still very much like this game, but there is a sameness to it each time.  Still better than Acquire to me, for a stock management game but it has felt cold and too methodical the last couple outings.  8 to 7.

A very good light/medium game. The artwork and theme work well though the game mechanics could be wrapped into many themes. If really feels like a stock market kind of game. On your turn to you change the values to help yourself or hurt your opponents? Invest in workers (grow your investment in a particular "stock" by placing them strategically? Or "sell" your stock when the market is good for more VP? The placement of workers to try to apply them to as many valuable buildings as possible makes for a little AP nail-biting. Highly recommended and easy to teach.

After 4 plays including all player number possibilities (4,3,2) I'm pleased with Arkadia.  I like the building placement mechanic best of all...it reminds me of other games where the Tetris shapes must be optimally placed (Cleopatra and the Society of Architects, Blokus, Domain).  It seems to scale well and has a nice tension trajectory and plays in the right amount of time.  It's a beauty as well.

After 10 plays over going on three years this one continues to please and gains in appeal.

After 16 plays, I doubt if I would ever part with my copy of this game.

Highly enjoyable tile playing and resource price management game.  Plays elegantly and quickly.  In the first 2 4p games using the beginners start position it came to a finish before everyone expected it to, that has improved on subsequent playings.

Suprinsingly different game from Dörn. Even when sold as a Ravensburger game, directed to more mainstream audience, it has a feel of a gamers game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
It's an excellent game that scales very well from 2-4.

A very good strategy game with just a smidgen of luck. I'd say it's more a gamers game. But those that enjoy strategy and hidden information added to their worker placement games, then Arkadia will pass with flying colours.

I've raised my rating a bit for this after bringing it out some more. This is a really good game with a lot of depth that doesn't become evident until a few turns in. I found some can suffer from AP as there is a lot to consider on your turn the farther into the game you get.
The scoring mechanism is absolutely brilliant, and this is what makes it stand out from many other euros.

It's a really good game, but not one for kids or families. This is a gamers game without a doubt, and the layers of complexity is likely what made this fly completely under the radar.

If you like worker placement euros, this is one of the best I have played.

Need more play to solidify opinion.  Very, very reminiscent of Australia from the same publisher.  I found the gameplay interesting, but worry that it's too hard to set up scoring opportunities for one's self; i.e. this may be mostly a game of capitalizing on opportunities created by your right-hand neighbor.  Or maybe not.  I'm looking forward to my next play, but I doubt this one will hold up over time.

For some reason I keep thinking this is Michael Schacht. Come to think of it, that might also explain why I did so badly. Dorn's games are tenser than Schacht's, and my memory of playing this is mostly that I kept thinking "if I do that, something BAD could happen!"

There's more to this game than first appears, and that's a good thing. I suppose none of the mechanics are particularly new, but they still combine into a nice mix.

Interesting tile-laying game with pieces that seem to be taken from "Torres" and the computer game "Tetris". There is some room for clever playing, but being limited to either place a tile or workers was probably a bad design choice. That means that instead of pulling out great moves, you are more likely to set them up for the next player.

open board starts out somewhat amorphous, but guided by the villages that you squash to get the little tan neutral dudes.  Then things start to take shape as buildings fill in and then the dudes swoop in to score. i was off to a slow start on my first game and then started picking up a bit, but I misunderstood how the endgame worked and didn't play all my dudes causing me to miss out on a bunch of points which in turn led me to write this run-on sentence.

It has no right to be this good when it is so simple. Despite its simplicity, there's a lot going on--it's area-majority meets stock market meets Tetris. Accessible, pretty, fast, and very fun. Dorn seems unable to do any wrong.

A very tactical game that has an abstract feel to it (mainly due to it´s mechanisms), atleast if played with only 2 players. The score mechanism is very well done and the heart of this game.

Appealing. Visually pleasant, mechanically surprisingly tight. I was expecting a slightly more forgiving game, but the very limitted workers kept it tense. Exactly the weight I want for its playing time I think. High production values, but I had trouble counting the gold, would prefer a numbered currency.

I'm not really into Tetris type games.  When placing buildings, I always seemed to be helping someone out.  If I tried to get points, the next player would be able to score even more points...  Don't think I'll be playing this one again.

The pieces are nice though, except for the four flags which hang from your player screen, they are too thin.

RATING: 9
(04/12/2009) This is a fascinating game of 'castle building', which involves laying down buildings and workers, to collect influence from four aristocratic families. The influence can be cashed in for gold, depending on the relative amount of influence of each family, displayed on a set of ingenious, 3D castle pieces. Play is fast, with only two things to do each turn: 1) lay out a building OR place workers, and 2) optionally, play one of your four banners to get more workers and score your influence into gold. The game progresses as the empty board fills with buildings, bustling with workers, and the castle pieces build-up on one another to rise above the town. The theme is very good, as one struggles to balance laying out buildings or placing workers for future scoring. Easy to play and teach, as the rules amount to 3-4 pages. There's plenty of subtle strategy to this game, along with exciting tactical play, which plays in 60-90 minutes for the first time. It could drop to 45-60 minutes on subsequent games with experience. Rating: "9".

(10/06/2013) 7 plays: Played three consecutive games with 3-players, which was incredibly fun. There is no mistaking that this is a "classic", "pure" Euro, through and through, up there with Tikal, Settlers, and Torres, but somewhat underrated and overlooked. Spiel des Jahres Nominee, and deservedly so. This is a superb design, with a simple ruleset, limited action choices, family-accessible, but with a thought-provoking decision space. Quick playing time is a plus. Visually appealing spatial elements, with Tetris puzzle-like building pieces that begged to be placed optimally, so as to get as many neutral workers and/or set up to collect as many family seals. As soon as a building is surrounded, the active player gets to add Torres-like castle pieces to manipulate a simple stock market mechanism that is also eye candy. With only four scoring banners, this presents deliciously agonizing decisions on when to get more of a limited supply of workers and trigger a cash-out of collected family seals. Still has holding power after all of these years, and it is most refreshing to see what simplicity and genius look like, after the glut of overproduced, overly complicated, or gimmicky "Euros" that have appeared lately. Continues to be a strong "9".

First played May 8th, 2007.  This takes a bit to figure out/learn/teach, however it's pretty strait forward.  It doesn't take too long to play (maybe an hour).

RATING: 6.5
I enjoy Torres, especially the stacking tower pieces, so was swayed into getting Arkadia, but Arkadia is more than just Torres II. The spatial placement of the buildings, in addition to placing people, plus the strategy of timing involved in when to play your limited cash-out flags in relation to the ever-changing array of tiles, gives Arkadia added dimension. If the tents and flags were of different material, and the pieces were easier to put away in the box (if each shape of building had a spot that you could set them into and use for gameplay) I would enjoy it just that much more.

On www.yucata.de now.

Based on the first couple of plays - a solid "good" game for me.

I needed the first play - not only to get the feel and timing of the game - but to get over how few workers that it seems you have to use (a big part of the game is making your workers "go a long way").

The game always seems to end quicker than you think.

Even though it's not my cup of tea, it's still *much* better than I expected.  If you like tetris, you owe it to yourself to try this.

The stock market simulation really did it for me.  You have some limited ability to both control the prices and control when you sell off your holdings.

Ideal Players: 2-4

Description: Place buildings and works. When a building is surrounded, players score points for workers touching that building. The points scored are also dependent on the colors showing on the tower, which change each time a building is scored. 

Pro: Minimal randomness. Interesting investment dynamic for weighting the tower towards/against a color. Blockus-like building placement is spatially challenging. Easy game to play.

Con: Not much complexity. Theme pasted on game mechanics. Hard to come back from being behind.

Die Baumeister von Arkadia has a number of interesting aspects - particularly the Reef Encounter-style scoring. On the negative side, the options open to you on your turn are perhaps too strongly affected by the actions of the player before you. The components are rather attractive, adding some semblance of theme to an abstract game.

I feel like I need to give this game one or two more tries.  In all the times I have played this, I have felt like something was missing.  One player seems to always fall into a position where they place a building and by the time it comes back to them, all they can do is place another one since all the positions had been filled.  

When you are the player in the downward spiral, it is nearly impossible to regroup  and you end up just watching the rest of the game.

A solid entry by Dorn.  It has the spatial interplay that you would expect from Princes of Florence, but that does not quite materialize.  The scoring and valuation mechanisms are interesting, and I can see real replay value from this.  Pretty heavy for a Ravensburger game.

Area influence:tile placement:market manipulation

initial rating 1 play 4 players Essen 06

This is a solid offering from Mr. Dorn that I believe has some decent replay built in but as others have mentioned nothing new and nothing particularily interesting stands out here so might stale quickly. 

Initial card distribution determines for you which buildings you will be able to place on your turn. On your turn you have the option of man placement, building placement or using one of your 4 flags, flags give you 2 more of your own men from the supply to place on the board later and you have the option to sell your colors for the current market value at this time so you do need to becareful when you use them. Building on top of "camps" give you neutral men which can be used for placment, these won't score you points but will help you to initiate scoring. After finishing a building and scoring you now get to place a tower in the "market" to help influence the future worth of the colors. That about sums it up, fairly simple and elegant but also lacking strategic depth. 

Similiar to Australia in the placement of men and multiple scoring opportunites but I think I like that game a little more as it seems more strategic and harder to see the optimal move. It could be the player numbers I have had for each game though, this game might be a little more strategic with only 2 or 3 at the table ergo somewhat better, with 4 it is far more tactical but still good. A nice little screwage factor built-in with the placement of towers which as mentioned is influencing the market. Good pace so no big downtime factor, 60-90 minutes, very little luck, easy to learn but lacking depth and the sitting left of the weak player syndrome is present also. 3 probably optimal but it should scale well. I won't be buying as it is too similiar to Australia for ME to justify both but I will certainly play if invited.

A low-medium complexity game that is interesting, quick, includes some neat components, and has some new mechanics that I've never seen before. That being said, it's pretty abstract and I have no real desire to play it again. I would play again if asked, I just wouldn't request it myself.

While fairly abstract, I think this one is a winner.  Enjoyed by all I've played it with so far.   Dorn has become one of my favorite designers.

My only complaint is the double-sided tape used to put the tiles in the tower pieces does not hold well.  It looks like I will need to glue those in.

RATING: 8.5
Rating after 7 plays - three 2 player and four four player.  Game works well with both numbers, but is a lot faster with four (use those scoring markers!).  The placement rules are simple, but it is the rolling stock market that makes the game.  It is highly frustrating when you are about to cash in and suddenly the market shifts, so plan those scoring rounds.  Another quality effort by Rüdiger Dorn.

I was surprised by Arkadia. I wasn’t expecting a good game but Arkadia presents you with some hard decisions. The game´s rules are very easy to teach and learn, however the game has more depth that I initially thought. The game components are ok when you take them individually, but when they are displayed on the board, the game looks gorgeous. The game has some luck in it due to the cards, they are managed a la Ticket to Ride, however when you play your workers or cards AND when you cash in your banners creates for some very interesting decisions. It is very hard to set up possibilities for yourself, you have to capitalize on what the other players (specially your left neighbor) are doing. The play time is relatively short if there is no AP player in your game, otherwise the downtime can be excessive. 

On the down side, there is no theme at all. 

Arkadia is a good stock market game, I’m willing to play it again soon. Perhaps it can go higher in my personal ratings.

There's definitely some strategy here, but the game doesn't grab me.  Essentially Arkadia is a stock-market game, but there is a time delay between recognizing opportunity and cashing in on it.  Not unlike a real market I suppose, but real markets don't have area-majority scoring.  I think there's game here, but I'm pretty sure I don't want to sit through another five plays to find it.  Solid title, not for me.

RATING: 5
It didn't do much for me. My Tetris mind kind of broke the game and made it really shoot by. Once I had come up with the trick everyone at the table immediately did the same thing (they would have found it anyway if I hadn't been earlier in the game round).

The game was OK, but very light and very quick once that trick happened. We actually weren't sure we were playing it correctly, but we were (Rick Thornquist backed us up..he just said he'd never seen the board look like that before).I won't be picking it up personally unless there's some huge sale (update: 2008, there was). 

I had way more fun playing the Downfall of Pompeii in comparison--they are nothing alike, but I'd put them both at about the same level of complexity. 

Arkadia is an OK game, it just didn't do much for me out of the gate, but maybe it'll grow on me a bit. I will totally say that it is a beautiful presentation though and plays as quick as it says. 

I love the Torres pieces as well! :) The scoring reminded me of the tile scoring in Reef Encounter, so much so, I wonder if there was inspiration. Doesn't bother me at all though 'cause it works.

One of my favourites from 2007... I can't seem to find the time to play this one enough.

Every turn provides you with multiple choices as to what and where to play.  The scoring system (and when to score) is controlled by the players... so waiting a turn or two could actually decrease your score.  Almost too many choices...

Hasn't gone over at the club like I thought it would, but I keep trying...

RATING: 9
I believe this is the first 9 rating I have handed out.  This game is great.  Many things going on here, from having to manage your workers, placement of your workers, placement of buildings, and picking and placing castle pieces.  All the while tring to manipulate which seals are worth the most so you can cash in when there stock is high.  This is basically stock market 101.  You invest in a certain color of seal and sell them when they are worth the most.  Great game, good mechanics just plain fun.  Easily one of my favorites so far this year.

RATING: 8
We've played 2-player so far.  One of the best tile-laying/geometry games I have played.  I like the "lay funny shaped tiles" genre (a la Cathedral and the like), and this combines it with a stock-market-like scoring mechanic.  The result is a very subtle timing game.  There's always too much to do on your turn, and it's often easier to improve your opponent's position than it is to improve your own!  This leads to a lot of strategic give and take.  Be  very  careful about when and how buildings are completed.  And never let yourself run out of colored men.

Interesting investment game where on your turn you may either place a new building or place workers around a building on the board. You are looking to surround buildings with your workers so that you can receive colored seals which can later on be sold for gold. 

The players are actually in control of the market value of the seals which adds a nice level of decision making to the game.

Very interesting tile placement & stock manipulation game.  I think there is a little more "art" than "science" involved in trying to read the trends in the value of the seals and the timing of cashing them in and that is one of the appeals of the game to me.  I think this game has an interesting psychological element in trying to predict what other players will do and by baiting them to do what you want by presenting tempting opportunities for them.

RATING: 7.25
This is an excellent game.  The gameplay mechanic is deceptively intricate and the game goes by a lot faster than you might think (once you've got the rules down, of course), yet you still have plenty to do and significant choices to make along the way.  There is something satisfying about building the castle vertically while playing; it is both aesthetically pleasing and different than most area control/tile placement games i've played.

Choosing when to trade in your chips for scoring provides each player with a great amount of flexibility... but you can only do so 4 times, so choose wisely!   This works great in the two player format.   

Nothing too special about the components... just little plastic men and stackable plastic castle parapets, but the end result works so well and the 2D artwork sells it.  

Pick this one up if you like games with a lot of choice, both tactics and strategy, and if you like the idea of building things.   Two thumbs up.
 

UPDATE:  Did not see enough table time in my home, so reluctantly sold it.  Still a very good game.

Gameplay is thankfully quick and off the beaten path. Highlights:

1. Highly replayable modular board
2. Hidden information actually works for once (players get to hide resources and points once they receive them).
3. Explodes the standard scoring round structure so that players may time their own optimal scoring. This is the game's standout feature.
4. Mediates hard currency through temporary credit (seals of the four noble houses) so that players are all competitively tampering with an exchange market. In other words, there's a kind of preliminary scoring that other players can try to head off before it "counts"- this is awesome and distinct from all the other games in my collection
5. Visually can be like playing multiplayer tetris - a bonus for those who like a spacial element to their games (e.g. Carcassonne) and a definite negative for those who don't.
6. Despite the spatial puzzle component, the theme makes for good conversation as the town develops.

Tiles of different shapes are placed around a center rectangular area. Once a tile is surrounded by other tiles or your people tokens you gain coins and the chance to place a tower in the center to change the number of colors used for scoring. The challenge is scanning the board for tiles that can be closed off. It seems fun, but the strategy seems a little abstract at first.

I think of it as a Samurai -lite.  Without the intense struggle for majorities, play is not as tense.  Instead, people score in proportion to the number of men surrounding the building, and so the issue becomes a matter of efficiency rather than control.  Still, the game is plenty rich.

One irony - we noticed that the pretty stacking towers are not only non-functional, they harm the functionality of the game by blocking lines of sight and making it more difficult to assess what colored shields are on top.

Only online plays so far at www.yucata.de. The game feels a bit dry and even old-fashioned. The multiplayer game is prone to kingmaking as bad moves by the player to the right can leave the decisive opportunity to the next player. But there is also room for clever moves so it still gets an initial rating of 6/10 which might rise with further plays.

Interesting game, the special pieces (plastic workers and Torres-like castle pieces) really just jazz up what is essentially a tile-laying game.  Physically it's a tile-laying game but it's also a stock game, in which you try to push certain ones up and others down by skillful placement.  I believe that over time, the best placements will become more obvious.  I like how quickly the game plays and look forward to trying it out more.

RATING: 7.5
A light tile placement game where players try to earn seals and cash them in for gold. There is a bit of market speculation as you try to figure out whether the other players will help you propel a house forward, or whether you should dump the seals while they are worth something. Gameplay is fairly quick, no real AP except deciding when to cash in. 

Components are certainly eye-catching, from the Torres-buildings to the player screen with hanging banners. The gold pieces were a bit iffy to me, but they are functional. Although I have to ask: why bright-colored plastic workers? They never move, so some nicely-drawn flat cardboard chits would've looked less jarring on the board.

Also, player screens were too THIN. Mine kept falling and the paper was so light that a slight breeze would cause it to fly.

The game is unusual, because it is not possible to play too personally. The player must place a tile in one turn and only in the other one he may place meeples. And this creates an interesting feeling of always helping the others. The aim is to get as much benefit from this as possible.

Žaidimas įdomus tuo, kad negalima žaisti pernelyg asmeniškai. Tai, kad vienu ėjimu turi statyti kortelę, o tik kitu gali dėti žmogeliukus, sukuria įdomų jausmą, kad nuolat padedi kitiems. Tikslas - iš to išpešti kuo daugiau naudos.

This is much more simplier game than it looks. Behind the beautiful components and all this little pieces it is actually a very abstract game, but quite good one. There aren't long time strategies, but you just try to maximies your points on every turn. A couple of usability issues and "too much preparations before you can actually starts", but still a very much '7' game to me.

[2007.Nov.29] An intriguing take on set collection and stock markets. This clever game by Herr Dorn requires careful balancing of initiative (knowing when to do your own thing), parasitism (knowing when to ride on someone else's coattails), and timing (knowing when to cash out). Another good-looking production that deserves some table time.

A really delightful card/tile-laying combo strategy, layered with a multi-tier scoring/timing mechanism.  Everything is based upon the tactical influences of placing your workers.  It plays very quickly once you get the hang of what you can do, it all goes dynamically quick.  End game is big.  Timing and opportunity are as vital as determining accurately what your opponents' are planning to place influence on and when/what they wish to score.

Very satisfying game that packs a lot of decisions into 45 minutes.  Early rating, this has the potential to move up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Solid, quick little stock market game which is very unforgiving of mistakes, particularly in placement of your workers.  You get 5 scoring opportunities in the game, the first four occur when you wish at the end of one of your turns.  These four scoring opportunities also give you 2 much needed workers for future use.  Skillful placing of your workers as well as timing your four optional scoring rounds (banners) appear to be the key to winning the game.  If by some chance you have the opportunity to complete two buildings in the same turn, its too good to pass up as you can really manipulate the value of the seals most times in those situations.

Ultimately, I have many stock market type games and would prefer others over this one.  Sold in the charity auction for Lydia.

Arkadia, while fun, is in many ways exactly the type of thing that Eurogame critics hate. The theme is dull and cliche, and ultimately not reflected well in the gameplay. The mechanics have a lot of artificial restrictions on them that additionally remove from the theme, making the game even more abstract. It's the sort of situation where although I don't mind the game, I can totally understand anyone who doesn't.

The game has Tetris-like buildings and workers that you use to collect colored seals. Then there is a tower in the middle of the board that dictates how much the seals are worth in gold. I should really like this game, but for my tastes it is a bit dry. 

I do like the Tetris aspect of the game, but repeated plays have left me flat. I think this is largely due to the 1 action per turn: build OR place workers. With the theme of the game it seems like you should be able to do both.

The stock market aspect of the game is pretty, but feels forced and actually helps other players more than yourself. For example, lets say I cash out 5 seals with 4 tower pieces in play - 20 points. The next player completes a building, adds to the tower making it 5 tower pieces in play and cashes how his 5 seals for 25 points. In short, there is no way to block an opponent.

It is not a bad game, just not one I would play very often.

[thing=25643][/thing] reminded us of mostly of [thing=6249][/thing] where you try to collect seals of a particular color.  The major difference is that you have some control over the value/distribution of the seals whereas in [thing=6249][/thing], the value/distribution of the colors are fixed (although you can use the dummy player to change the values of your opponents tiles in the two player game).  The tetris-like spatial component reminded us a little of the mosaics in [thing=22141][/thing].

The game worked fine with two, although there weren't many big fluctations in the color distributions---no one could really build up the value of the red seals without the other player either lowering the red values back down or piggy-backing and getting red seals for themselves the next turn.  This might be a case where having a little more chaos between turns might actually be more fun.  Still, I thought the stock market mechanism was pretty neat, although she found it a little boring---she thought it was too simple with not enough actions/decisions each turn.  All in all, especially for just two players, we enjoy the spatial and dummy-player component of [thing=6249][/thing] more.

This game sat on our shelf for a very long time before it got played, and I honestly don't know why. It's a wonderfully produced game, with great artwork, and really nice bits - the plastic men and castles could easily have been cardboard, but they make the game so much more thematic.

What I really like about this game is the scoring mechanic. At the end of your turn, you have the opportunity to turn in one of your flags in order to convert the seals you have collected into gold (VP). You only have 4 flags, so you need to be cautious, but flags also give you more men, which you need for collecting seals, so you may have to occasionally use a flag when it isn't optimal so that you can increase your earning potential later.

I also really like that this game has such easy rules that it could even be taught as a gateway, and yet there is enough complexity here to keep anyone thinking.

It's a placement game and anticipation/opportunist game, that make the planning difficult in long term, since we have to react and take the first opportunity that we can have.  The counting system is original. The game finish fast and is may be too short, but it's a ligth game.

Just played a 2nd game--ooh this is way more fun than I expected.  It sure is fun trying to figure out the optimum time to score. I don't want to read any strategies because that will spoil all the fun. Did I say 'fun' enough?    

Early days, since it's our first play (2p) BUT I have to say that this game is so DIFFERENT and loads of fun!  Miles also is intrigued which is a definite plus.  It's worker placement, though different than the usual and one of the better themed games I've come across.  The 3D aspect coupled w/the tetris-shaped building pieces make for a visually interesting game.  We will have to play many more times to be able to understand how to best time using banners and evaluations to gain workers and gold but it will be fun figuring that out.  I love the components and even the flimsy player screens for hiding info from your opponents are nice with places to hang your banners on the front!

Oh how abstract this game is. Workers surround a building and it is completed? Number of symbols on stacked castle seen from bird-eye view makes difference on coin's price? Come on.

Anyway, this is a mixed bag - card drafting, tile laying, worker placing, don't-do-good-to-your-opponent factor, and a kind of stock manipulating. Nothing new.

That said, it is well-interwoven. Placement of tiles and workers is completely abstract but gives lots of choices and things to think over. But the core part of this game is stock(coin)-manipulation. It makes the game more tense, more interactive.

My wife and I have played it once so far, and we both enjoyed it.  Like the novelty of gameplay, nice bits, and lots of tactical and timing decisions. Chance elements (but too heavily done) which is good so that the chess-master/go-master in the family doesn't always win. Also like the screens which keeps the game in suspense for everyone.  I was surprised at the end when my wife revealed a pot of tokens she had horded in one color.  We used the suggested setup for first-timers.

RATING: 5
1 play.  Liked it less than I thought it would. The placements are counter-intuitive and there is no direction in the early game.  The various components of this game were appealing - (tetris-like pieces, plastic figures, castle pieces, coins, etc), but it felt disjointed to me and I never got a real sense of discovery or fun.  Like Domaine, too much changes from turn to turn making the game play purely tactical with no strategy.  Also, should have been an abstract as the theme is COMPLETELY pasted on.  

Would try it again to see if my opinion changes though.

Rating after only one play. I played a 4-player game and three of us played overly conservative having one or more banners and workers left at the end.  The most aggressive player won.  I'm not sure that's always the best strategy unless everyone is playing conservatively.  I did find that the game felt as if it moves rather slowly at first and when I thought we were hitting the midpoint of the game it was suddenly over.  More plays will most likely adjust my perception of the game and my rating. Overall I did enjoy the game and feel that there are enough decisions to make to keep it interesting.

I've played 2 two player games now and I'm very pleased with how the game plays with two.  I can sense the end game better (more plays may have done that anyway) and I feel more in control of who will be in a dominant position when closing and/or evaluating.

I am continually surprised by the games that win me over. The first two rounds I was thinking, "I really hate this game; stupid plastic workers and your stupid Tetris buildings." By the third round I was having a great time. This is basically a dressed up abstract where you have to score points by placing your plastic workers around buildings, score seals, and then try and change the price for the seals by adding corresponding towers to the castle. (Much easier than it sounds). The game looks a bit kiddie, but it really isn't a game that would be too accessible to younger children. Overall, I thought this was a super fun game!

04/03/10 Played a three-player game. 
I enjoyed Arkadia once I got the hang of what I should be doing. I suppose its not really any more abstract than most German type games. But it strikes me as more so, I think mainly due to the components. Those castle pieces smack of Torres, which is nothing by an abstract game, and one I don't like. I look forward to playing it again.

Initial rating after first 2 plays:
Average euro city building game where everyone's very keen that their move doesn't support the other players too much. Due to this plus it's sometimes hard to figure out what's your best move, it's possibly a bit A.P. prone. But meanwhile it plays still reasonably fast. Gives a tensionable play within an hour.

Although I happily won my first 2 plays I'd have to play it more to see where various tactics lead, and to see how much replayvalue this has.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A couple of plays. For some reason this just doesn't quite work for me. It isn't bad and I do want to play it again but it doesn't seem to have that *magic*

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Game in a Nutshell: Lay buildings and workers on a grid playing surface to earn seals. Then cash in the seals through a evolving market when you decide to gain gold (VP).

Played as: 2,3 player (2,3,4 player on Yucata.de)

Pros: A great, fast puzzle-like game. The tile laying allows for creativity in play and a loose-ness that keeps the game from quickly becoming scripted. The back and forth pull of players affecting the market combined with timing the sell of your seals compliments the tile-laying. The game's length (45 min) is quite appropriate such that it does what it does then raps up the game. The design could have easily been lengthened to include a whole lot more of the same, wearing out its welcome, but remains surprisingly tight instead. 

Cons: More on the 'brainy' side than 'fun.' It's easy to get caught up on its initially confusing abstract nature and it will likely take a game or two to blossom. Doesn't do any one thing so well that it separates itself from all the other euros out there, and the theme disconnect doesn't help. It's just one of those games of everything works, but that's almost it.

Other: My first play took me by a bit of a surprise. The game ended before I could grasp what I was doing or even formulate a strategy. After that, I understood the flow of the game better, but still can't say I grasp exactly how I should play. It doesn't seem to affect my ability to win or lose so I'm not sure what to think about it.

Best Use: Fast Puzzle-y euro.

An interesting tile-laying stock management game (when you boil it down).  Players can place a building card from their hand OR place workers.  Once a building is surrounded: a) the player who completed it earns it's family seal (stock) and every worker piece, around the building, also earns it's owner(s) additional seals (so you can work in unison to complete projects) b) the player who completed the building places a castle piece which shows a family seal onto the castle grounds, usually covering up a different coloured family seal (stock manipulation). If you're still following the interesting part is after a player's turn they can decide to play one of their four pennants and score any seals they have for gold.  The value earned is the number of seals turned in times the number of seals of that colour currently showing on the castle.  I was impressed by how fluid all the mechanics fit together despite the fact that Dorn's patented stacking mechanisms were missing.

This game reminds me of two others which aren't that great to me - Reef Encounter and Goa.  All of these games have lots going on, with no real way to keep track of it all.  Either too much happens between turns for you to plan ahead, or there are enough random elements that you can't plan ahead.  I feel that Arkadia suffers a little of both.  The building cards are pretty random - it is difficult to plan ahead on how you will place buildings and workers because your opponents might do so many different things, and none are predictable.  I don't know if this makes any sense... it's hard to explain... but the game just doesn't do it for me.

RATING: 7
Arkadia is essentially a [geeklist=73884]"stock game without stocks,"[/geeklist] centered around Tetris on a board. It's a tight little game, easily explained but offering quite a bit of difficult game play. I like how the game shifts as it progresses, so you never feel like you're doing the same thing repeatedly, even though you are merely choosing between two actions on every turn. While Arkadia has the advantage of being playable with two to four players, I found my one four player game dragged a bit, so I really prefer it as a quick but meaty two-player game. (Perhaps it is best with three, as BGG says; I haven't tried at that number.)

Pretty typical fare from Ravensburger; Simple and clean idea that doesn't feel fully realized. There is certainly an interesting dynamic to the game as you place workers in ways to hopefully benefit from other buildings as they come out. I think what ultimately ruins this game, for me, is that you can only score 4 times over the course of the game. This presents not only a high barrier of entry due to the fact that you have to be careful when you score, but also the fact that opportunistic players are going to benefit from this the most. It kind of reminds me of Alhambra, in a lot of ways, in that the scoring is both aggravating and oftentimes rears its ugly head at the most inopportune times. The game may just be too tight for what it is. I enjoyed it well enough, but don't see myself returning to it.

A charming game, incorporating elements of Tetris as you try to muscle your way into a position of superiority while building the city.  Uniquely you get to decide not only when the scoring takes place, but also how it is counted, by placing tiles on the castle, which also acts as the game timer.

This game is elegant and finely balanced, but has not done enough to warrant a permanent place in our collection.  While I admire its qualities, and think it would shine with more players (I only play with two) I find it a bit dry and believe that something would always be picked before it.

Le jeu dure moins longtemps que ce que peut laisser comme impression la première portion (1er étage) de la partie. Chaque dėcision doit être bien réfléchie, mais pourtant on ne ressent pas vraiment de temps morts comme tel puisque nous sommes intéressés (et très souvent positivement ou négativement) affectés par les choix des autres joueurs. Deux systèmes (placement/gestion de ressources & scoring) très bien implantés et intereliés.

Pas le jeu le plus complexe qui soit, mais peut s'avérer assez déroutant et ne pas convenir à certains type de joueurs.

Picked this up randomly from a sale and played a few games before giving it away to a friend when we relocated.  It was fine, but the various mechanisms (tile laying, building, price manipulation) always felt a bit 'messy' and never really meshed for us.  Only tried 2 player, which may have made a difference.

RATING: 6.5
Players either put workers onto the game board, or put down buildings with a colored seal. There are four colored seals in the game: silver, black, green and red. Everytime a building is surrounded (by workers or other buildings), colored seals are distributed. Whoever has an orthogonally adjacent worker to the building closed, receives a colored seal of that buiding. In addition, whoever closed the building, gets a bonus colored seal. That player also gets to put down as many castles as buildings closed. Each castle has one of the four colors, and the sum total of the colors represent the amount of gold each seal is worth, an amount that fluctuates as more castles are placed, and the castle can go up to three levels. 

Players can also earn migrant workers by placing buildings over rubble on the map. Also, each player has four flags to use during the game; gain two more workers, and/or trade in their seals for gold. At the end of the game, a final evaluation takes place, and whoever has the most gold is the winner.

I played this twice with four players. The mechanics are simple, but there are tactical plays which one has to look out for as you try not to leave too much stuff for your next opponent. With four players, it seems that near the end, you have to ride out the storm as best you can, and hope your seals will win the day, as the values can change pretty quick. It's an okay game where you play it tactically from turn to turn. I do prefer games with a little longer term strategy, but hey, different strokes for different folks. I would willingly play this game, but I wouldn't suggest it.

RATING: 7.2
A mix of tile placement and stock market games that turns a series of small choices  into something that's surprisingly strategic. A strong amount of player interaction emerges from the changing valuations of the seals that you collect. Choosing when to take advantage of your limited scorings is probably the most unique element here. With 4 players it's decidedly more turbulent... I probably enjoy it most with 3. A  game of simple rules, limited resources, and opportunism.

One of my favorite games played at the 2007 GoF. I really enjoy the decisions of when to place your dudes on the board, when to score your coins, and how to manipulate the scoring mechanism. I see this one getting a lot of plays. Not really worth playing with 2.

Tentative rating based on one play.  Some interesting placement things going on here, but I'm not sure how I feel about the pacing of the game as a whole.  Final rating will probably end in the 6-8 range, with either end being as likely.  For now, I'll average them.

--update--
After a second play Arkadia rests at a 6 - but a good six.  I don't know how much game is really there, and I'm seldom truly excited to play it, but I don't anticipate ever being disappointed after playing it either.

A combination of generic components from other games utilized in with a strange mix of mechanics makes Arkadia an odd game. As more and more polyomino tiles get placed on the board achieving the game's simple goal increases in difficulty, but gradually enough that a novice player's understanding can keep pace. Abstract and puzzle-like, but attractive enough to hold player's attention.

Place buildings and workers.  Once a building is surrounded by either other buildings and/or workers the building is scored by giving the contributors coins.  These coins, in four different colors, can be exchanged for victory points four different times in the game, and once in the end.  When converting you look at the middle building and count how many times your color shows up, that's the conversion rate.

I enjoy this game, the first play or two might be tough for new people because of the timing of when to 'score' but the learning curve is not too steep.

That feeling you get in Web of Power where you're the first one to break a region?  There's a LOT of that going on here, and it snowballs.  The strategy (and fun) seems to be knowing how to best ride that wave.  Very fun.  Getting tired of the theme, though...

Not sure if it's best to concentrate on one seal or try to get many. Can be beneficial to hold onto seals until they are worth 5-6 apiece, not necessarily damaging to use a flag early and not collect any money for it.

RATING: 8
It's a stock game hiding in a medieval setting. It's basically a quite abstract but doesn't feel too much like one. You're trying to make most of your 11 workers and buildings you or others build during the game. In the beginning there doesn't feel to be many clever moves you can make and also it's annoying because you don't want to give too good positions to opponents.. Just lovely turn angst with your actions! I like scoring options the game gives because beside the end scoring you can freely 4 times during the game sell seals at the current price. Therefore you can do some extra profit by timing your actions correctly. An excellent game that can be played around an hour.

Stock market and tile laying game with a very weak renaissance theme. Simple rules which are easy to explain, but a fairly tactical game where good timing and organisation and an awareness of the players around you is needed to do well. 

I enjoyed my first game as it was fast and flowing but on a revisit the game locked up as everyone became to concerned about not setting up the player to their left. (7.5)

RATING: 8
Deeper than it looks, Arkadia is a classical area control game given the Euro treatment - players lay tiles from their own hand on the board and in order to score they try to surround them with their own guards (or otherwise neutral guards they gather as they lay tiles on special squares on the board). Each fully surrounded tile allows a player to gather seals and build a castle which shows the current change rates between seals and money (obviously the richest player wins), so we've got the well-known two-fold majority mechanism thrown in the mix yet again.

Of course this all reads like a typical German game - it is indeed one, but varied enought to stand out and so finely tuned that would work perfectly without the topic as well. Its focus is mainly tactics - only one castle can be surrounded at a time and therefore the rivals have got to be prevented from filling loose gaps at once.

A lovely blend of Tetris-esque tile-laying and stock-market economics, well in keeping with the excellent reputation of its designer. With the price inexplicably plummeting, there's no excuse for anyone not to own a copy of this. The design of the colour palette seems to be a particularly poor choice for playing under low light levels, but it's only a minor quibble.

Further Thoughts: Promoted from 7.5 to 8.5 as the intricacies become more apparent. A really beautiful game.

This is an ok game.  I don't like the way the game ends.  It just kind of sputters out...just not real elegant.  Other than that the game play is pretty good.

Nice game, nice materials. You should play it several times to get more the grip of it. It offers quiet a lot of gaming pleasure.

Arkadia to me was neat, it worked, clever even, but was so completely soul-less and so OTT Euro that I'm not sure how often I want to go near it again. I couldn't make up one little story about why I was doing what I was doing - just no link between theme and mechanic at all. The game-play was workmanlike, mechanics were fine, perhaps a bit too slow to play, getting a bit of that Torres paralysis. I did like the twist on "you choose when to score" mechanism in that the only way to get more scoring men was to use 1 of your 4 score triggers, meaning you're forced to pace yourself consistently through the game. I do have concerns about RH setups being too strong a factor however. Not sure how much I care though.

You place buildings and meeples around the board and once a building is surrounded it gives you tokens of different colors and allows you to modify the value of these tokens. You may also chose to score after you play and this timing is very important since since you are in control of when you score (a nice mechanic).

Tetris combined with a stock market mechanic.  It seems like knowing when to score is key, and it can sometimes be advantageous to "score" even if you won't get any points.  The obvious strategy is to place your dudes so that they touch multiple buildings (or place buildings so that they touch your dudes).  However, the whole stock market thing just seems to add an element of multiplayer chaos--you don't really have much control.

First play was fun, 2p with wife; wicked good looking game. I'll suggest it next time we have a group of gamers together.

Update 3/15/15 - 4.5 years since my initial thoughts and rating of a 7.  In the meantime I had traded the game away as I tend to do with euro-games in this weight and timeframe. I really enjoy playing as many of these mid-light games as possible, consuming their rulesets and initial tactical revelations, but very few keep me coming back like their heavier brethren. I enjoyed Arkadia enough that I normally wouldn't have traded it away, but in my first math trade I was over eager and listed ten games that I thought I'd be alright without.

I was wrong about Arkadia.  Even though it didn't get played regularly, it had crept into my head and established itself as one of my favorite games; maybe my favorite mid-light euro.  I just repurchased it last week.

Arkadia rewards a combination of taking advantage of the ever-changing board state to maximize immediate benefits available on your turns, and manipulating incentives to encourage others to make plays benefiting you when it is not your turn.

There are three different systems you manipulate to your advantage.  The first is building around the castle where you are placing building tiles to take immediate advantage of surrounding previous buildings and covering worker camps to gather more workers; and you are placing your workers in places where they will likely collect multiple crests, where they will make it more difficult for opponents to make big plays, and adjacent to buildings or worker villages luring opponents to make mutually beneficial plays.  

The next system is building the castle and changing the value of family crests.  More strategic considerations go into effectively building the castle.  You may want to improve a certain family if you have many of their buildings in your hand, or if you are adjacent to their crests on the board.  You may also want to advance a family to make it more attractive for an opponent to finish a building you are next to (especially if it can be finished by a certain building shape that you do not have access to).  Of course you need to pay attention to your opponents so you can diminish the value of crests they are collecting that you aren't.

The third aspect of control in the game turning in your banners. I love that you determine when you score in this game.  It is very satisfying to take a turn where you complete multiple buildings, collect a slew of crests, build up their value on the castle, and then turn in your banner, pulling in dozens of points.  More often you will use a banner because it is the only way to get more of your workers, and while you may not be able to get a huge score every time you use a banner, hopefully you can collect a few crests that will be at a high value and worth trading in for each of your banner uses.

The players determining when they score is absolutely brilliant.  In many area control/majority games and games with changing valuation you use your turn to improve your situation as much as possible, and then hope you weather the chaotic tide of the other players' turns.  In Arkadia you get the ability to immediately reward yourself when you have a really awesome turn.

This makes Arkadia excellent at all player counts; however with only two players it can become a much more strategic game where you can set up a big play over multiple turns without your opponent's interference.

Some last thoughts on this Arkadia's excellence: It is the handsomest game I've ever seen. It plays in an hour or less and can be explained to new players in five minutes.

Rating adjustment 7->9, this game is Best in Class and is the only lighter game that I have scored above an 8.

I feel quite optimistic about this one. At first we started to build buildings (into empty board) without knowing the purpose. Later we figured it out better. This usually requires a first try-out game or some pre-laid buildings on board. 

Building system (tower and houses) works fine and there is always something to do for everybody. Sometimes it's quite hard to see all how a building can be effectively closed with workers, but it can be learned!

I like the scoring mechanism and the puzzle like building. Also, there is this strategic placement of your workers. This is great, but the luck involved with the cards is a little annoying. Also, with 4 players the value of a color may change a lot until it's your turn again. That's the things I don't like about it. Anyway, very good game!

My wife totally loves this game. It is a hard game to define, probably a strategy positioning game title would suit it best. The piece positioning as well as the timing on when to cash in your pieces are critical. One missed opportunity or sell and you are down in the game. I would recommend this game for people that really like thinking types of games. There is luck introduced by the random card draw, but this is minimized by the fact that there are face up cards that can be picked. The components are very pretty too.

This is a brilliant example of simple rules disguising a surprising depth of play possiblities.

There is a bit of an element of Tetris, fitting the blocks (buildings) into the play area, and then surrounding them with workers. It works really well, giving you lots of things to think about with each placement (trying to gain extra workers, surround other buildings, cut off opponents, etc.)

Then there is the stock market element, where you can influence the relative value of the various coloured seals you collect throughout the game, and choose when to cash in to get the best value you can.

The components are great, although the player screens & banners are a little on the thin & flimsy side.

Arkadia has the rare distinction of a game being played back to back. This is mainly due to simple turn options laden with some look ahead considerations and subtle spacial tactics which become more obvious during your first game, that you feel could improve on (placing workers next to small buildings); also games feel short due to the absorbing play, ensuring another session.

I too will add my voice to the many by saying Arkadia is an imaginary world where what you are doing makes no narrative sense. Surely a business and executive placement with a central stock exchange during the course of 3 days would be a better fit.

RATING: 8
In this game, players get a hand of cards. On their turn, they can either place a card, which then adds the corresponding tetris tile and matching seal to the board, or they place workers on empty spots. When a tetris tile is fully surrounded with things, workers standing next to the building produce matching seals for their owners. Then the player who completed the building has the opportunity to add a castle piece to the central structure. Each castle piece has a seal printed on it, so at any given time, each seal is worth VP equal to the number of visible seal icons in the castle pieces. Since the castle is a plastic construct, once the first level is built, you start stacking on previously placed pieces. In this way, the values of the seals are ever changing. The nuts part of this game comes from the 4 "get new workers" banners. Four times per game, you can discard one of your banners to sell your tokens for what they are currently worth, allowing you to try to time the market.

I love tetris tiles, and I like simple stock market mechanisms, so this game was a big hit for me.

Interesting idea for a game and I love the components.  Played with 2 and 4, and my hunch is it's best with 3.  Probably suffers from a person's plays having strong influence on the player to their left, so if three players of equal skill and one new not-so-good gamer are playing, the player to the left of the new guy has a big advantage.  Still, a smart hybrid of stock market and, uh, whatever the other part of the game is.

Solid fun game.  I'm finding I'm not a fan of "complete the box" games, but Arkadia provides enough variation and geometrical placing to make it quite good.

I've found that players hoarding workers can really drag the game out.

This game is deceptively move challenging that it appears to be. The play is simple, but still requires a bit of strategy. To me it seems that there are too few workers, but adding more would definately change the feel of the game. I like it, but the end game seemed to fall a bit short to me.

RATING: 7
Visually pleasing game, nice components.
Place buildings on the board then try to complete them by surrounding them with other buildings or workers. Everyone who helps gets a seal in the building colour. The value of the seals depends on the castle: built section by section when buildings are completed.
Cash-in seals when they are at their most profitable. Most money wins the game.
Takes one play to see how it all works but then is easily accessible.
Good fun game.

RATING: 7.5
Very simple in it's mechanics, with enough strategy to keep me interested. The flag/scoring system is what really stands out here, meaning timing is everything in Arkadia.

I'd say 3 players is probably the sweet spot here- where you'll have less downtime between turns, meaning more control over how the tiles get laid around your workers.

Overall: Arkadia feels like a classic that breathes new life into the classic board game formula with a couple novel ideas. Very fun

RATING: 7
At first I thought the game might just be a degenerate game of chicken.  However, once you get the hang of the pacing of the game, it works very well.  Judging when to use banners to get works and do early scoring is interesting, but not as mathy or swingy as I'd thought -- you could do no intermediate scoring the entire game and still do well, but timing it right is an edge.  The balance between placing buildings and workers is interesting.

While I don't normally mind hidden trackable information, I think this game is worse for it.  Playing with visible seals (but hidden workers and hands) makes the choices more interesting but still not too AP-prone.

update: but the game really suffers from turn-order issues.  Seating order is the most important factor, especially with beginners in the mix.  This makes it exceedingly hard to introduce people to it.

Got this earlier this year, when it first became widely available. I was on the lookout for it, because I saw it played at BGG.CON 06 and i had mistaken it for some weird torres based prototype game. So I wanted to see what it was about. It's not a bad game, but there wasn't enough going on to hold my interest. It made the table a few times, but I'm not in a rush to play again.

----------

Very gentle stock market game -- seal values never get too high or go too low.

The game has a lot of strategy in placement of workers and buildings.  Timing is crucial to get the big payout, and you have to make sure you don't leave a good play open to your opposition.  

To me, Reef Encounter fits this niche much better than does Arkadia.

I enjoy this.  Overproduced for sure, but I enjoy the pieces and they set the game apart from the rest of the Euro-crowd.  Your options, while limited in type, are wide open for strategic placement of your buildings and workers.  Like Reef encounter (only easier)... being able to impact the value of the scoring seals was key, and required that you watch your opponents possible scoring options.  The inclusion of the generic workers is nice, as they encourage laying out the buildings in a spread across the board (in order to hit the camps), while providing you the opportunity to ambush a building that opponents think is safe.  I look forward to another play.

A really fun stock game. Very little randomness involved.
I would like to try a variant that uses only two or three banners (with an extra worker gained per exchange) -- or a variant where a banner trade results in the replacement of workers OR seal exchange (not both). It seems like either variant could make the game even tighter.

A reasonably pleasant little game, maybe a little too placid starting to shade towards boredom.

The 3-d plastic castle ramparts add a full point.

RATING: 6
2009 - Clever mechanism where all the little details come together as a whole to provide about an hour of fairly light and enjoyable gaming. The shape and size of the buildings, the neutral figures, the timing of the scoring - it's all rather well thought out. Of course it's abstract and doesn't give you anything satisfying in the way of a theme, but the bits are very nice and it's a pleasant enough game. A 7 for me.

2012 UPDATE:
The more I play this the more I appreciate it as a very clever game. Simple, packed with meaningful decisions and an enjoyable level of player interaction. What it really really lacks to make it a great game is a credible theme. While the castle and builders has a very traditional theme, it seems to me they missed the mark and failed to see this as a city building game (maybe with a mafia theme). I dunno, but there's got to be something to tie together this excellent mechanic to a really good theme.

With further play I've squeezed a little more out of the finer tactics in the game.

Dorn comes through again. Interesting stock market game where you feel as though almost everything you do is helping out someone else more than you. 
I like the number of things to do and think about on a turn, and I like that you control your scoring. Cool game. 

Small complaints: The theme is so tacked-on and thin it's laughable. And for some reason I [i]hate[/i] the plastic workers. I would rather have wooden cubes. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Very tight game.  On your turn you get to do one of two actions: add a Tetris-shaped building to the board, or add workers to the board.  When a building is surrounded by any combination of buildings or workers, it is "completed".  Players whose workers surround the building receive a seal corresponding to that of the building.  The player whose turn caused the building to be completed receives the seal that was on the building.  4 times during the game, you may trade in any of your seals for their current value (a multiplier that changes during the game) for gold and take 2 more workers from the supply.  Player with the most gold at the end of the game wins.  Very well designed game.  Plays extremely well with 2-4 players.  Game lasts 45-60 min.  Everything meshes together very well.  I think it should be a staple in everyone's game collection.

I have little interest in returning to this, but here's what I wrote at the time it was released: 

The key to the game is figuring out when to cash in banners.  I think the timing changes greatly due to how the game is played.  This is not something I initially appreciated, thinking that there was probably an optimal time.  Now with repeated plays, I can see that there is a little more strategy to it.  Overall, the game is solid, but kind of dry.

I might bump it to a 10 if your flags were specific to one color of seal... I'd like to try it that way sometime.

Very interesting and solid game. It has the mosaics (albeit done right!) from Cleopatra and the Society of the Architects, the demand track and manipulation from Handelsfursten: Herren der Meere, and the interesting help-you-help-me placement of your own markers from Die Saulen von Venedig, and it's better and far more satisfying than all of the above.

This is an economic game at its core, because you alternately compete with and cooperate with other players in terms of completing features to grab colored tokens, and also manipulating the values of each color. There are many, many things to consider, in terms of whether you want to complete a feature, posture (and dangle a carrot) for others to complete for you, get more neutral workers, try to find a way to obtain a certain color etc.

Three weaknesses. First, this game is AP hell, because it's very tempting for people to try and figure out the move that optimizes spatial placement and share manipulation, and that takes forever. The game usually wraps in an hour or a little over, but it feels much longer because of the downtime. Second, there is a lot of hidden information, though it is actually wise that it's hidden because it'd make AP even worse. Third, the boring Euro 101 theme + artwork and unexpectedly strong and unrelated gameplay just seem incongruous with each other.

4+2

A pleasant game that combines both 2D and 3D puzzle aspects.  The Tetris-like 2D game is that part that appeals to me the most, though I also enjoy the 3D portion of the central castle.  The limit of only four scoring rounds that occur only when you choose places an interesting constraint on the game.  In fact, planning for these becomes quite essential as the game seems to pick up speed toward its conclusion very quickly.  In fact, it is quite possible for the end to sneak up on you without being properly prepared as the flood passes you by. [03/14/2008]

So far, the best new game I've played in 2007.  (I wrote the previous sentence in May.)

Arkadia -- Played Die Baumeister von Arkadia three- and four-player.

As some players collected seals and waited for the value to increase before selling them, we ran significantly short of those seals.  For a game of such high production quality, this shortcoming was a disappointment.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Played once with 3P. Arkadia's an abstract, newbie-friendly Euro. It has some elements of tile placement (ala Princes of Florence) and stock market manipulation. A lot more tactical than it is strategic, there is quite a bit of interaction as closing off a building is often a (begrudgingly) co-operative effort. I also liked the idea of being given the choice to sell 4 times throughout the game, so there is a bit of a push-your-luck factor in there are players wait to see if the value of their seals increase or decrease. 

I was absolutely crushed in my first game because I didn't place enough workers on the board, and therefore didn't collect many seals. The game also ended much faster than I thought it would (~40 mins). Still, light and abstract Euros aren't very popular among the people I play with, so it might be some time before I can try to improve my score.

[1 play] I've only one online play to judge from, but this seemed like a good solid game. It failed to "wow" me in any way however, so I think I need to play it in person once more before I'm sure how I feel about it. The ability to choose when you personally score throughout the game seems like a cool mechanism.

Most recent play 7-13-10 with Corey and Gerard.

RATING: 7
Thematically weak, potentially dry. Yet this Dorn game meshes several already seen before game elements into something quite tension-filled and exciting. Players either place workers or play card that allows placement of tetris-style building tiles. Once a building is surrounded by either workers or other buildings, it's scored and players involved pick up corresponding seals.

To add complexity, there's a strange stock market system going on. For completing a building, the player gets to place a torres-like building in the center. This building has a seal colour which determines the multiplier when cashing in seals for gold/vp. Eg: There are three gold seals showing and a player cashes in 4 seals and gets 3 x 4 = 12 gold.

To further compound the agony, each player can only cash in four times and once more at the end of the game. Cashing in is important because you also get a fresh supply of workers! Lots of interesting decisions to make in this well made game. It doesn't feel like a typical Dorn game but it works.

After one two-player game, I'm in love. Quick-playing building game although the big variable of when to use your banners for optimal scoring may be a challenge for some casual players. For a light-medium game, though, it's a gem.

Tile placement. Great game in the ~1 hour time slot. Tile and worker play mechanic feels satisfying, especially when you can reap a good payday out of the subsequent castle building. Just a tad too complex to be a great gateway game, but I think could make a solid second game.

Not much interest in it from my group, so it didn't survive the great purge of '12.

RATING: 6
Arkadia is a game about positioning and timing. Your decisions in the game are aimed at collecting little discs in four different colors and then timing your sale of said discs to whenever the going price is the greatest. There are four or five nested "layers" of resources, depending upon how you look at it. You play *cards* to lay down *buildings*, which you then surround with your *workers*, to gain the colored *discs*, which allow you to play *castle pieces* which influence the value of the colored discs, which you then sell by using your *banners*, and get *gold* (which is what you need to win). So the game is set up like a cataract. You need to use A to get B, B to get C, C to get D, and D to get E, and she who has the most E wins. This is fine and well, but the pacing of the game is kind of odd, and it will end before you know it. So you need to play a few games to figure out WHEN to use your banners to sell your colored discs, and WHEN to complete buildings which allow you to build castle pieces which control the value of the discs, and WHEN to place the workers that will allow you to collect the colored discs in the first place.

It sounds complicated, but the rules are actually pretty simple. Arkadia is a straight-up optimization game in the Euro-game mold you are familiar with, and may be weary with to a degree. It's a game with a very mechanical and premeditated feel to it. There is only one basic strategies, and that's it. Figuring out the strategy is not why you play Arkadia, as anyone can do that. The winner will be whoever is best at implementation. You go after one or two colors and then try to control things so that these become valuable enough at the right times for you to sell and make lots of gold. There is a little bit of player interaction in that players may compete at times for worker placement - that is, the player on your right may snap up spots you have your eye on. That's it.

Arkadia is a solid game, but along these lines, I'd much rather play Domaine (for its brutally fun interaction), or Samurai (for its elegance), or Puerto Rico (for its variety of possible strategy), or Web of Power (for its tension).

The rules for this are probably a lot easier than I thought.  I don't really have a feel for the strategy yet.  (For some reason the center castle section reminds me a bit of an area-control game like a trimmed-down version of Reef Encounter.)

Rating after one play. I liked the Tetris and stock market elements, but there was a lot of conflict between players (more than I prefer). Because there are so few workers, the players were trying to mess up opponents' placements most of the time, rather than optimizing their own workers.
Edit: I bumped my rating down a point. On reflection, I'm unlikely to play this one again.
Update: Traded this one away.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
What a neat little stock market game.  I found that the game was chock full of neat choices, where you try to better your board position yet balancing out what you want to score off of.  The castle stock value element I found to be quite innovative, and made for enough shifts in value that you really had to work to make the most of your seals.  Mostly this game is all about intuitive timing, knowing when to sell vs when to replenish, all tempered by early investments in seals vs following trends.  I found the system lovely.  This light quick twist on stock games to justified its right to stay in my collection.

UPDATE: The more I play this, the more I can't wait to play it again.  Elegant and beautiful.  I suspect that this will be a much overlooked masterpiece.

It's building! It's area control! It's stock manipulation! It's an intricate web of mechanics. No one of them is particularly compelling on its own, but like Dorn's other games, the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.

Tentative rating based on first impressions. Exceptional, tight Euro goodness, plays tricks on the mind used to ever-increasing share prices in games. It will take a few plays to get a feel for all of the tactical considerations and tempo issues, but this game obviously has a lot going for it. I may introduce a 60-second timer once everyone has it down, as AP can be a big problem, leading to lots of boring downtime in a 4-player game.

Lowered rating to six after a miserable second game. With three players it's very easy to get out of tempo, so that every move just sets up the guy to your left.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's a good and clever game. However, the theming is really a stretch... the seals, placing the palace pieces, the payoffs, the migrant workers. Also, the physical banners are junk; I'm not sure why tokens weren't used instead. That said, I can overlook a poorly themed game if it plays quickly, is fun, and is constructed well, and Arkadia is all of those. EDIT: But not fun enough to keep - traded.

The scoring mechanism reminds me of Reef Encounter, but Arkadia is no where near as scary as that game. When you're first introduced to the game, it seems impossible that anything can be done with so few workers, but playing through that first game shows that there is more to the strategy than one would at first guess.

A fun stock market game that I really didn't get until about half way through the game. Plays very quickly and Dorn did a wonderful job with the simple rules yet deep strategy. My one and only complaint is that with the stacking tower in the middle, its hard to see what is going on all over the board. I constantly had to stand up and look while playing. Can't wait to play again.

Good area-control game.  Lots of timing and planning need to be done, as you have to decide when to score for having a layer completed as well as what are the colors of the towers that you can build.  Really enjoy it for the decision-making, and the components are cool, too.

After a couple of plays (4 player and 2 player), I like the game a LOT!  We were playing incorrectly at first, but after a more careful reading of the rules, figured out our mistakes. Don't forget to play banners early on or you'll get stuck. (The later rounds seem to fly by)

It's an area influence tile laying game. There's a deck of cards showing each of the building tiles in the game, with a colored seal. On your turn, you either play workers (start with 3 in stock, hidden) or play a card (4 in hand; draw replacement). When you play a card, you place the corresponding building on the board, with a seal of the color shown. (If you cover certain spots on the board, you get neutral colored workers.) In either case, if you completely surround a building (= occupy all orthogonally adjacent spaces), you take the seal on it; all workers in orthogonally adjacent spaces also give their owner a seal of that color. In addition, you get to play Torres-style blocks, with colored seals on the top, into the castle structure in the middle of the board (must complete level 1, then level 2). Then, at the end of your turn, you may turn in a scoring banner (you have 4): this allows you to gain 2 more workers, and also exchange as many seals as you like for gold (VP) = #seals x value of seals. Seals are valued by the number of seals visible in the castle when looking from above. The last round is triggered when someone finishes the 2nd level: everyone, including that player, gets one final turn. Then, a final scoring occurs.

The game was fun, but it's not something I'd necessarily have to purchase. The endgame seemed to come very suddenly, with none of us really prepared (all had 1 unused banner). There also seemed to be a waiting game going on, with everyone trying to avoid setting up the next player(s) for a big scoring opportunity. It was a good game, but I found some of the others to be more interesting.

I like it-I'm not going to lie to you.  There are so many things to consider each round it's almost mind-boggling.  I would rate it higher save for the tile laying aspect.  The geometry involved with the different tiles is relatively minor but enough to distract me.  Of course, that's a personal quirk.  Otherwise, quite a fun game, especially the stock element and fluctuating prices.  Good stuff!  Update:  I'm a big fan of the way the prices fluctuate, making the decision of when to sell a key strategic element.  I hope Arkadia will have long-term staying power in the upper end of the rankings.  A game this well-designed deserves it.

The obvious game to compare Arkadia with is of course Samurai by Knizia. An important difference is the scarcity of workers you use to surround the buildings. A natural tactic would be to use them sparingly, but it's actually better to trigger scoring rounds often, so you get more of them. If you don't, the game end may come sooner than you would think (or wish). Like with Lost Cities, this sudden end puts a lot of pressure on the players, making your choices more important and therefore interesting. I like that.

+ Combinaison of spatial placement and stock market is really unique

- The boards, cards and buildings are a little beige
- Non functional money
- Theme is thin

:star: VERDICT
Really fun game. Placement and banner use must carefully be planned and timed. The stock market part of the game means you have to check what your opponent do and try to outsmart them.
Perfect mix of simple gameplay (2 actions to pick from) with depth and interaction.

RATING: 7.5
This is NOT Torres, okay?  If one more person says to me, "Hey, this is just like that other castle game."...  Arkadia is a game where several different mechanics work together beautifully to create a very enjoyable and competitive experience.  Each individual element of the game is fun, with a couple of highlights being the manipulation of the market and the players' choice of when they do their own scoring/money collection.  And the production value of the game is excellent, although how cool would it have been if all the buildings were 3-D as well?  Very cool, that's how cool.  I realize that's asking a bit much, but Eagle Games would have done it (I know they went under - what's your point?).  But the odd thing about this game is, even though there is practically no luck in the game, it still feels quite chaotic with 4 players and it seems impossible to plan a strategy.  Rather, you find yourself reacting to the other players and trying to minimize the benefits that they will receive after you're finished your turn.  Therefore it seems to me that the game would play more strategically with fewer players, since it would allow you to better focus on pursuing your own gains.  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 3.5/5  Total: 7.5/10

RATING: 6
Probably a good example of a well-designed game that doesn't appeal to me; the "make a good play without setting up the guy on your left" genre.  Unfortunately, my instinct in these games is to to refuse to make a sub-optimal play to hose my left-hand opponent just because my right-hand opponent refuses to do so.  This instinct is totally wrong, so not only do I usually lose, I usually cause my left-hand opponent to win, which doesn't make me too popular.

After 2 years and 6 plays, I'm going to give Arkadia the half point of rating.  It is always interesting but not always in exactly the same way.  Players play geometric shapes and surround them with their own pieces in order to collect coins of 4 different colors, meanwhile manipulating the market values of the coins.  The first thought you have about the surrounding system might not be "Clever!" but it turns out to be engrossing.

Has some new ideas which I'm always excited to see. I'm a bit disappointed with the flimsy paper flags -- I would have preferred cubes or even thick cardboard tokens. You have to be careful that when you help yourself, you're not helping someone else even more -- *especially* if that person is already ahead of you. It loses a point due to this Njet!-factor. The game feels like it should be an 8, but it may not quite make it. In fact, it could drop if this issue crops up too frequently.

This is a solid game.  Nice little economic engine, some good territorial struggles...I'm looking forward to playing it again.  I don't like the overproduced castle much, but I guess the market dynamics are such that it's a reasonably efficient way to do the work.  But still--can't we play a game that doesn't involve building castles?  Would that be too much to ask?

Rating after one play.  May go up.  Forget the theme.  This is an abstract game.  Players place Tetris-like "building" tiles, and "workers" on a grid to score colored "seals" which can be exchanged for "gold" victory points via an exchange rate that is dictated by the current configuration of the "castle".  Despite being almost completely divorced from the theme, I rather enjoyed it.  It works very, very well, and it plays fast enough that it doesn't seem as dry as it could be.  I look forward to playing again.

RATING: 8
A stockmarket game in the same sort of ballpark as Knizia's Samurai. Placing buildings & workers that don't move, with a view to gaining tokens by contributing to surrounding buildings. Instead of drawing new tiles to replenish, you get just 4 opportunities to obtain 2 new workers, and you need to pick those moments carefully because they're also opportunities to sell the tokens you've collected to earn cash at player-influenced rates. One final grand sell-off of tokens at game end, then most cash wins. Works great as a 2-player, and I'm keen to play with more ASAP.

This game has some interesting things going on, from the spatial element of placing buildings & workers, to the commodity speculation of tracking and influencing which colors are valuable and which not, and adjusting your actions accordingly. 

That said, so far the game hasn't wowed me. It seems quite dry. Only 2 plays so far, both times with 2 players, so the jury is very much still out after more plays,  with different player counts. But I doubt this will ever be more than a 7 as it seems to lack that special something.

I'm not entirely sure how to describe this one. Its a fun little game that combines a number of familiar mechanics - stock, area influence, and spatial game play. Each player is helping to build the central castle (sort of). Playing cards lets you play a tetris shaped piece onto the board. Each tetris piece will have a color on it. Players also play their workers to try and exert "influence". When a piece is completely surrounded, there is an influence payout to those surrounding the piece. Players can also (at their choosing) score the influence pieces based on their worth at the time they want to score them. Its really less complicated than it sounds and the different pieces work well together.

To me, this is a neat twist on worker placement.  A finite number of workers and once placed, you can't get them back.  Played two times so far and both times played out very differently with people using their workers more sparingly in the second game than in the first.  Definitely a fun game!

Very solid, but really bogs down as a two-player game given the dynamic of having to be very (perhaps overly) careful about not setting up the next player for a killer turn. That dynamic, also seen (and implemented better) in games like Medina and Hansa, can cause a bit of analysis paralysis in Arkadia. Update ... the don't-set-up-the-next-player dynamic is even more pronounced in a four-player game. I often like that sort of tension, but in Arkadia I don't find it all that enjoyable. A clever game that just doesn't seem like a lot of fun to me.

RATING: 8
Very accessible game, but a few people I have introduced it to have had difficulties developing any sort of strategy and end up not placing all their workers. The game plays exponentially and the end sneaks up on you. The game plays very differently than any other game I have played, which is always a good thing. In fact, the three games I have played before this writing all played out differently as well. Highly recommended game that plays relatively quickly with some good tactical decisions. I have not played 2-player yet, but 3- and 4-player plays great. I have a feeling 2-player plays even better on a tactical level.

Rüdiger Dorn is famous for multi-layered balancing mechanisms, and this is a very tightly woven game of efficiency.  Arkadia is tough to get one's head around but is very enjoyable, even for those who are--like me--not "spatial."  The 3-D pieces are what drew me to Arkadia in the first place, and they are completely unnecessary.

I enjoy this game more than two of the other SDJ nominees (much more than Thebes, and slightly more than Zooloretto) but not as much as Yspahan.  It is basically an abstract, but loosely enough that I can get into it.  My wife rates it a 10--she absolutely loves the shifting conditions of the game.

RATING: 5
A decent, tetris-like game. The center area forces some interaction, but otherwise in a two player game, it's easy to ignore one another. That could change with additional plays. I'm a fan of player shields, so that's another plus.  While the production value feels pretty good, especially with the castle pieces, the art itself feels outdated.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7

I like games where you and the other players have built something in the end like Railroad Tycoon, Carcassone and now Arkadia.

More tactics than strategy, scales well from 2-4.  I am glad it is in my collection.

Update:  Rating stays the same.  I still like this game.  I really like the stock-market mechanic. I was mistaken in what I wrote earlier - it doesn't quite feel like you've built something like RT and Carc. 

Update: I haven't played it again, but I wonder why I don't bring this out more. Part of it is that while the theme is fine and the components are nice individually, the total package is a bit strange. I just don't feel excited to introduce it. The flags are weird too.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 2


Overall - 1.5

:star: I like the way the palace is being built in the middle of the board over the course of the game
:star: the fluctuating values of seals, combined with the limited number of opportunities for cashing in seals and the uncertainty of how many seals others have, make for an interesting decision
:star: also a nice puzzle is when to use your own workers, and when to use neutral ones or no workers at all
:star: game doesn't overstay its welcome by any means
:star: cool workers, seal tokens and palace pieces

:nostar: only 2-4 players

A city building game with a stock market.  Interesting, could rise with repeat plays.  It forces interaction, and forces the players to be in everybody else's business.   My games put into a blender analysis Medina, Loco, and Blue Moon City.  Just not as good as the above mentioned.

Nothing new, nor well done.  I'd never ask for this to come off of the shelf.  I'm a big eurogamer and I would rather play almost any other euro game.

Rudiger Dorn has done it again.  This is yet another great game by Mr. Dorn, and surprisingly different from his other great games (Goa, Louis XIV, Traders of Genoa).  It's a stock market game with a spatial component on the board as you're placing workers and buildings on the board to gain more seals (i.e., effectively investment in the stock market) and using your placement on the board to give you chances to influence/modify the value of things in the stock market.  It also has tricky decisions as to when to score just like Gheos since you can only score a few times during the game and it's up to each player to decide when to score what they've collected, so you can push your luck and hope that your stuff goes up in value, but this can also backfire if you wait to long.  It's a fun and interesting game that plays surprisingly quick, especially with only two players.

Stockmarket tetris!  As soon as I learned the rules I knew I'd like this one.  There is a lot of tomfoolery with building and placing workers that I need to get better at.  Timing and knowing what your opponents are going for is crucial in this game.  Still not sure if it is better to place workers where they will catch a bunch of other player's buildings or placing them where you can build your own next is best.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The design of the game is very nice and thorough. I don't see any rules that seem irregular or hard to understand. I don't really like the 'option to score'. When a player feels its a good time to score he uses one of his markers and scores appropriately. I think its one dimension of the game that isn't completely developed. Most of the strategy revolves around laying buildings and workers. Which can sometimes be on the limited side of strategy. Overall, fun to play and easy to teach.

RATING: 7.5
Rating after 10 plays.

This game is really cool. There are a number of interesting mechanics involved, much of it requiring decisions of timing. You certainly need to stay on your toes so you don't fall too far behind, but if your head is in the game, this can be anyone's game right up to the end. I really liked the game at first, and with each play it continued to prove enjoyable, especially once I realized you can tackle a 3-player game in 40 minutes (plus about 10 minutes of teaching, setup, and takedown). Similar to Mykerinos in its weight-to-time ratio. What a great Dorn design.

Some friends disagree, but I've always liked this game.  The rules are very accessible, the shared geometries and the open opportunity for scoring make this game a favorite of mine. The separate scoring opportunity of the castle, adding and blocking off scoring colors, is a great idea. Peculiar to this game is the ability for players to determine when they score, which is a neat method. I'm sure it will get more play.

面白いのだが、ゲームを見た瞬間に受ける印象『テトリスみたいに工夫して置いてワーカー配置して得点』とはぜんぜん違うゲームだった。仕事を終えたワーカーが戻ってこないというルールが縛りとして非常にきつく、このおかげで何度やっても「クレストを取れるのはワーカー２人で....この手番はワーカーを置かずタイルでカバーしたいが....そうすると敵がワーカーを置いてくる可能性があり....敵は何色を集めており....」と全要素を考え込んでしまう。思考中にルーチン化して自動化できる部分がない感じ。囲碁みたい。ワーカーを増やす方法がもう１つあり、そこにゲーム性が込められていれば（たとえば中立ワーカーに金を払って雇うとか）、もっとラクで楽しかったと思う。

This game can best be described as a light stockmarket game. All the decisions are there: Do I go for majority stakes on a small part of the board or do I participate a little all across? Do I sell my stocks (seals) now, or do I wait a bit more? Do I secure my profits or do I risk waiting another turn? In short, if you like that sort of game (like me), you will certainly dig this title.
My only complaints against this game are the looks (components are tiny - certainly not what you expect when looking at the pics here at BGG!) and the fact that it is only suitable for 2-4 players (which means it has loads and loads of competition).

Oof, another gem by Rudiger Dorn!! He is fast replacing Knizia as my favorite designer!! Arkadia is ingenious. Yes, the game can be a little dry and lacks theme, but the action is fast and furious and certainly quite brutal. His games always play more than 2, but boy, the game is a gem with 2 players as well. Resource management is tight with having only 2 men with each banner usage, but it is enough to create lots of delicious tension.  Love it! I wonder if with more players, the tension is diluted since you have less control of the board and less able to capitulate on your opponents' moves. Way to go Rudiger!!

This game has some real potential and looks beautiful!  It uses tower pieces that look like they were riped out o Torres.  There are alot of competing goals.  You only get two guys and you have to use them to surround buildings.  They aren't going to do it, so you have to crush nomads with buildings to wring additional workers out of them.  They aren't really yours, so you have to turn in a pennant to get more workers of your own.  The problems are that you only have 4 pennants and it just so happens that you can only turn money in at that time.  It is a challenge to balance out your options.

RATING: 8
After playing some 250 odd games, I am not as easily impressed as I used to be, or perhaps it's that I am now working my way down the rankings rather than up. In any case, it's refreshing to play a game like Arkadia and be substantially impressed again. Like most stock games, Arkadia is mostly about timing, but Arkadia adds a spatial element that is reminiscent of Acquire but at the same time totally different. You don't want to set up too good of a move for the person going next, but you do want to cooperate a little bit or you won't get your seals and the seals you do get will tank in value. The compete/cooperate dilemma is subtle here but quite engaging. The production value is great also.

Seems like there's not quite enough to do each turn.  The decisions aren't quite important enough.  The interaction among players is subtle.  It's hard to fortify your position and easy for the other players to get in your way each time around the table (which is only slightly helped by the voluntary scoring).  It will take another couple of plays to understand the tempo of the game, but I doubt I will give it enough attention to figure out the finer points of playing.

Hello dryness!  Hello boring-ass building theme!  Hello bizarre abstract mechanics welded onto aforementioned lame theme!  Sometimes it just seems like game publishers aren't even trying.  Okay, the main mechanic is mildly intriguing, and the components are nice, but the game is just dying to be made fun of.  The best that they can do for a theme is building in "a faraway land?"  What.  The.  Hell.  That theme wouldn't fly with me if the mechanics were "have the best sex of my life."  Fuck you, Euros.  Fuck you.

Oh, and the mechanics are of the type where if you get other people to unwittingly help you out, you'll win.  The end.

RATING: N/A
Tetris-y tile laying game, where you place buildings on the board, then try and surround them to earn differently coloured tokens. When you complete a building, you place a palace section on the board, which allows you to change the relative values of the tokens.

The game is a tactical "do I cash in my tokens now, or can I make them go up in price later" kind of thing. You only get 4 chances to cash in during the game, and only two replacement men to surround the buildings with each time, so you're really hard pressed to get the buildings surrounded.

Arkadia is a game about building the city and castle of Arkadia.
\13\\13\
Players use builders, cards, workers, and neutral workers to build houses in Arkadia. Houses are built with the seal of one of 4 families; this family gave the building order and will get the building player its seal.
\13\\13\
These seals can be changed for victory points. But seals are subject to changing values. The growing castle (every time a house is built, players also build on the castle) has the 4 seals on it as well, which decides the value of each seal. The castle is also the game's timer: once the second layer is built, the last round starts. The player with the most gold wins.

Interesting game - values for your seals change during the game, so you want to collect till its high then "payout".  Your build options are limited by cards - the 3 player game felt like you'd get a lot from "tagging along" with another player in the same color,  punishing those who build alone.  Feels like a lot of "sell high,  then push the price back down" while rotating the color you favour.  Kinda makes me think of Imperial now....

pretty decent game with a tetris like mechanic. I liked the use of the castle blocks to create the castle and used to create also the stockmarket effect governing the values of the coloured seals. However, I have a few issues with the game..1. It's kind of ugly. Both the board and even the illustrations of the buildings..The castle towers look even uglier and less inspiring than Torres and there's no reason why the couldn't have used a stacking concept but maybe a completely different and funkier design/colour (yes I know they are different than torres with the Brick facade but it's very very marginally different). 2. unlike a lot of Rudiger Dorn's works (which I mostly like) the theme is as thin as a sunday pancake as well..But aside from that I *do* like how the game plays out, there's still a medium amount of fun factor to the game, with more strategy than initially appears. Also I was pleasantly surprised to find this game also plays very quickly and is easy to teach to new players.

Played about four times in my group. Some people really enjoyed and others did not like that much. I am looking forward to the next game... I have to update my "comments": As 2 player game Arkadia is good and the best strategy wins, with more players a good strategy can be destroyed or sometimes only the others benefit from until it is your next turn... Nevertheless, I really enjoy it but prefer as 2 player game!!!

Nice tactical game, with great production value.

I got a decent track record on this. 

Something about the game clicks with me. Like it a lot.

Fun game that I need to explore a bit more. I like the building/puzzle aspect of the game - the tetris like board creation as it fills in. Will play now and then. Rating may climb with more plays.

This is a fun little tile placement game. I like the control over when and how scoring happens.

An excellent city building game. The rules are simple and straight-forward, with each player having only one mandatory action (either place a building or place workers) and one optional action (to cash in 'influence' for gold and gain valuable workers) each round. Players can only cash in influence four times during the game and when to do this is the most difficult part of this game. Cash in too early and you may not get the best influence to gold exchange rate; wait too long and you may not even get to use some of your four cashing in actions. Fiendish stuff, but quick and extremely enjoyable.

place building tiles to be built, with cards OR place builders to work on said building tiles... IF you surrounded a tile with workers and/or other tiles, you set-collect 4 colors of tokens, then you get to place a castle piece that changes the values of the 4 token colors... THEN, you MAY score any of your tokens and take 2 more workers (up to 4 times during the game)... building tiles are different "Tetris" shapes and there are spots on the board that will give you neutral workers when built over... most gold (VP) wins!... thinky and cool!...

RATING: 7.5
+: easy to learn
+: no randomness (except player chaos :-) and initial turn order)
+: interactive/conflict-rich: try to snatch opportunities (placing your men between other's buildings), while not giving such opportunities to others
- not for 5+

Cool Tetris feel, but fairly light.  I always feel like playing meatier fare.  Even when I feel like something lighter, it seems I never pick this.  My friend keeps asking for it, though.

Interesting tile-laying game. Needs a few turns, or maybe a complete game to wrap your brain around it. Reminded me of Gheos in a way, because of the "shares" in different colors, and the tough decision of when to cash in (score). I don't think this will win SdJ, because the strategy needed is too opaque. That doesn't bother me, though. Nice bits, good presentation.

City building with a puzzle element in the tile placement.  There seem to be more depth than it first appear, especially in setting up your workers in positions that will score you as many seals as possible.  Low in player interaction, and although you can manipulate the seal value in the castle, it felt nearly impossible at times to prevent someone from scoring big, thus contributing to the problem of a run away leader.  There is also a seemingly first player advantage, as well as for the person that triggers the game ending condition.  Need more plays before getting a good feel as to whether this is a good or merely an average title.

I like Arkadia a lot and am willing to play it more, but it seems difficult for me to grasp what a good strategy would be; maybe that's why I want to play and explore.  In any event, I'm terrible at Arkadia and still want to play it - always the mark of a good game, in my opinion.

Underrated game.  A mixture of worker placement and area control and manipulation of victory point conditions,  Interesting game.

I feel the geek rating is too low for this game. It has surprising depth of strategy and it's easy to learn. Blocking your opponents is fun and key to winning.

An excellent designer game that might feel a bit "middle-of-the-road" if you're burned out on this style of gaming, but offers interesting  spatial thinking, price manipulation, and overall an attractive, quick package that plays well with four players.

Like, this game is just missing originality. Like it has shared mechanics, shared peaces, even shared rules with some other games. But... in the end it makes really great gameplay, so... I just shouldn't complain.

Coloca tus trabajadores en el tablero para tener la mayoría en un edificio y así ganar los escudos de las familias presentes en el castillo central. Los niveles del castillo varían por lo que el momento en que vendes los escudos es importante.

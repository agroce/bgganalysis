Typical Crayon Rail system.  We tried with the variant Open Contract to allow for more player interaction. We played the new version which has the 4 piece puzzle board instead of the old 6 pieces.  Deliveries seem to be a bit more different since there is more load going East - West than before.  From Ebay, 04/11/09 for $10.  Sealed.

I found this a lot of fun the first couple times but now it's just too much multi-player solitaire. Maybe more interesting with more players and it's still a decent amount of fun but I prefer Railroad Tycoon for my train game

RATING: 7
Good logistical game.  Great fun for 2-players or more.  Probably tops off at 4-players since 5 or 6 would really cramp the small board.  I enjoy the public locking rules and many other variants.  Haven't tried the variant where you make Newcastle & Plymouth major cities and require 5 of 6 major cities to be connected.  Note: I have the boxed 3rd edition.

A real mind-bender. Between learning the geography of 100 English cities and figuring out the best way to fulfill contracts for 100 different commodities, my brain started to hurt. Seems like something they should play in business school.

RATING: 7
I used to think of this as Roads and Boats Lite, and to an extent it is.  Many on the 'geek recommend the crayon games as good starter train games, which they are.  But the more I play this, the less "lite" it feels.  It is an easy game in the sense that your task (and the rules) is very straight-forward.  Accomplishing the task well is the key, and it is here that there is much more subtlety than I used to give credit for.  The interaction between the money spent on the network and the distance the train can travel could occasion much analysis, and it certainly is more nuanced than I previously thought.  Having the board be wide open, with the networking possibilities completely open is something I'm really starting to enjoy.  Indeed, of late I've come to appreciate deeply the design styles of the late 80s/early 90s (like Silverton, UvC, etc) that emphasize grinding, repetition, and a longer end view.  The rules are easy to master, and the play is about ramping up well and mastering the game length (which can be long).  This one is underrated.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
About half way through this very long game, you realize that you're either still in it, or out of it.  By that point, drawing, counting, and recounting crayon lines has gotten old, and there's nothing to do but sit back and wait for the inevitable conclusion.

The last (and truly last) game of this I played ended when someone intentionally used the leader's track to get the damn thing over with.  Thank God.  We might still be there.

I really wanted this to be a hit with my wife.  Pick up and deliver seemed like it would be a good mechanism to try out, this was listed as one of the best games for couples, and it seemed at first like it would be fairly simple as a step above Ticket.  But no.  I don't know if it was because I picket the british map, because the chips all looked too similar, or because it actually turned out to be more complex than we thought, but we only got through half a game, then put it away to finish later.  That was a year and a half ago.  I still have hope though, for some reason.

Comment from Iron Dragon:

I don't understand the appeal of any of the crayon rail games, on turn 2 someone was eliminated because a bridge was washed out in front of him and you are not allowed to turn around and he had no money to rebuild (it was only the second turn) and so that was it, he was out. The end game was sort fun, but the 4 hrs it took to get there was worse than getting teeth pulled, I will NEVER play one of these games again!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
For those who aren't familiar with this game system, which is based off of Empire Builder; players build train routes using crayons, drawing track in-between points on a map of the UK. Each city on the map supplies certain types of materials, and demand cards that you have in hand dictate what cities want what items. You control a pawn, which represents your train, and it moves about the board, picking up and dumping off loads. You win the game by connecting the 4 major cities, and having 250 in cash at the end of your turn.

Frankly, I was extremely let down by this game. Turn to turn decisions are straight-forward, and the amount of time it takes to do things is tedious, even with players who play quickly. After each delivery, the hassle of having to locate each city / demand area on the card, cross-referencing that with where you are and where you're going, and cross-referencing THAT with where the goods you need are feels more like busy work than a game.

Luck of the draw is absolutely huge here as well...one player who can get a couple of high value loads to a given city is going to have a huge advantage over the player who ends up with things strewn about the board. The "dump your whole hand" rule seemed to do little to help this, as there were always at least 1 or 2 decent cards in my current grip, and 1 which tended to cause problems, either because of locale or the value of the goods.

On a final note, the opponents in this game should each add about an equal amount of playtime to the game, and I just don't think that they add that much to the system. There is very little (if any) competition for the finite load chips, and on the board, the most they are going to do is make you go a slightly longer way around and spend a few more bucks. I don't think I would even want to spend the time on this solitaire though.

I've played Empire Builder and Iron Dragon, I like this version better.  I think it's a fantastic game for two, the map constrains track construction and therefore limits the time you'll spend playing.  The first time I played with my 13 year old son the game took just a few minutes over 2 hours, including a rules explanation as he had never played a crayon rail game before.

I hate crayon board games.

It doesn't really hold my interest. There are better games out there which are better than this one. Why would you spend time playing a bad game when you can play a game which is more worth your time and enjoyment?

Why this version than another in the same series? I don't see any major differences between the crayon board games. They are all a like to me. The more I play, the less I enjoy this kind of game. Major turn off. Come to the point, if the game is propose, I prefer not playing anything at all. Don't know why many gamers enjoy these types of board games.

There are too many better games out there that playing this game on a regular basis is a waste of time.

I don't plan to play British Rails any time soon.

I'm a big crayon rails fan, and I enjoy British Rails, but it's not really balanced (the line from London to Liverpool and then straight up the west coast dominates.)  Bruce Linsey has a new demand deck and some map changes that improve the game, but even with these, which we always use at my house, it still falls short of Empire Builder, Eurorails and India Rails for me.

I love the crayon rails games, so this is not an impartial review. I live in the UK and that also adds to the appeal for me.

Our most recent addition to the series.  Our copy is a first edition, with the puzzle map, and punch out cards and load counters.  Got it off eBay again.  It was unplayed and unpunched.  I didn't realize there would be such a difference between the editions.  I may try to pickup a newer version at some point in the future.

My first crayon rails game.  Only played a couple of 2P games with Karis thus far.  We quite enjoy it, but it seems to take a long while (2  hrs) even with the fast rules and no events.  I'm sure more plays will increase our familiarity with British geography and the production locations, and thus speed up play time.  However, I don't expect we'll want to play this more than once every other month, so the familiarization might take quite a while.

Fun like other crayon rail games, but obviously way too long and doesn't show its age well in many mechanisms.  The random events are such a killer and don't strike evenly at all.  Still fun to build up your network and watch the map develop.  Long deliveries for big $, well, pounds sterling, are so satisfying.  Overall, this is a good game which I don't have any particular expectation of ever playing again, so in my rating scale, that is a perfect 6.

Another interesting board for the Empire Builder series, that is perfectly suited for three players. There are several key choke points/valleys on the board that are up for grabs. So much so, that there was more borrowing of track than in other games. It is simply too expensive to build through the mountains after someone has grabbed the ideal route. As always, it is a matter of personal taste.

Rated after two two-player games with my wife.  As usual she cleaned my clock, but it was fun.

The flooding events and Longshoreman's Strike events can cause havoc.

Not my favorite crayon rails game.  Can be very unforgiving -- one of the winning conditions is to build rail to Scotland, but if your demands don't make that run lucrative, you might end up putting it off until later in the game.  By that point, the other players might have already grabbed the inexpensive routes to that part of the board. Good with three players, not with other numbers of players.

RATING: 7
The classic Eurorails map has never really been bettered, but British Rails puts a nice twist on proceedings with a calculated risk as to how far you dare build at any given stage. I prefer the distribution of contract cards: the multitude of shorter routes making it easier to get up-and-running and rewarding spacial planning.

The production qualities, even for 1984, are pretty dire, though. And how on Earth do I make a storage system for a thin box like this?

A well balanced rail game. Provides for a tight game between players. A really enjoyable game for 2-players. If you are trying to purchase one of the rail games and were not sure about buying this one (like we were), don't be. This rail game is most fun and frankly we don't mind owning any of the rail games...they all are a blast to play.

The most amazing thing about this game for us is that coincidentally our first game of this was picked to play the day that the 2010 Secret Santa targets were announced. And our target was from Bolton, just outside of Manchester, Great Britain...go figure!

I found this map similar to Nippon Rails, with long north-south links & runs with only two cheap routes. I only play the system 2 player though, which works out for this map and so we've always enjoyed it.

This is probably the most linear of all the crayon rail games.  The first one to build a line from Glasgow to Manchester and Birmingham will probably be the winner, since the rest will have to take a more circuitous route.

RATING: 7
The geography of this map makes it very difficult, the map is very small and very mountainous.  If you're playing with four players, you will be getting in each other's way, and don't rule out riding each other's rails.  This is probably the most confrontational crayon rail I've played, which isn't what most people expect out of a crayon rail.  If you like that style of play, though, you'll probably enjoy this map.

Fun, interesting version of the Empire Builder crayon-drawing railroad games.  A good one.  But, like Wagner operas, these crayon rails games seem to go on forever.  Expect at least 45 minutes per player, and our group averages almost 90 minutes per player per game.

Got interested in the crayon rails system, decided to try this one first based on the smaller map and simplicity of the system.

After one solo play and one 2P play: pretty fun - I like the logistics and planning aspect of this game quite a bit. The tactile route drawing is also enjoyable. We played with the quick game rules, and while I might set starting cash back to $60, I can't see why I'd use the slow 9/12 movement trains rather than 12/16 - with so many turns spent just moving it's much better to have the high allowance. Also, we decided not to play with the event cards, as they only serve as a random spoiler factor and don't add anything to the strategy.

I do wish there were more player interaction in this game. Without more experience with other pick-up-and-deliver train sorts of games, I'm not sure quite what that would entail, but it would be more enjoyable.

Update - I think I prefer Silverton to the Crayon Rails system, but this is still pretty fun.

The version I played had four pieces of cardboard boards that fit together fairly decently, with plastic crayons for marking.  They didn't mark very well, and you had to be careful to not accidentally rub out other players' tracks with your hand as you drew your own.  Drawing across or along the board joins didn't work too well, either.  The "tube" version might be the best playing surface.

RATING: 8.5
NOTE: This is one of the faster-playing crayon rail games. Since it is one of the first it has the least complications. It also has a small map and the benefit of being familiar terrain (so less time is spent looking for cities!). The end result is that this game tends to be played more often - hence the higher rating than the others in the series!

The map is tight, leading to good games for 2-3 players, with maybe too much competition with more than 4 players.

The main problem with these games is the length of time they take to play, although numerous variants exist to help with this.

NOTE: "Honeymoon" variant exists for 2 players (involves removing one of each type of good & lowering connection limits to cities)

OWN: 3rd Edition (the newer boxed edition with errata & more balanced loads/routes so that more of the board is effectively used).

Money is initially tighter than in the other 'crayon' railgames. Even with only 2-players the cheap routes were pretty much all taken quickly. Much of the SW part of the map may never be included in the rail net as all 4 required major cities are in a mid-E-W N-S line.

British Rails, and it's brethren of crayon games, is an excellent pickup and deliver game where players create their own railroad network.  Players must balance spending money to create their network with the returns they'll obtain by delivering goods to complete orders.  I absolutely love these crayon games.  There is something very excting about utilizing your route to deliver the best goods for the most money!

For me the best of the crayon-rail games.  The good thing about these games is that it's not the rules, it's understanding the maps.

This is the best for multiplayer, since you find yourself needing to move fast to get through the cheap routes. Of course, to make good bucks and win you need to extend the cheap routes, so the "build local and then out" works as well, but is a bit trickier to play.

I absolutely LOVE the crayon rail games. A friend introduced them to me a few months ago and now I would just love to own em all! British rails works really well for two players. My wife and I played this and she got quite into it which is always good for me. There is something to drawing/building and seeing your rail line continuously grow, all the while making decisions on how much rail to build and when to upgrade your train etc. That moment when your opponent makes that first 30+ million contract when you have a couple of 12's happening can be disheartening and a lot of fun! Learning the geography is a lot of fun as well, and one of the main reasons I enjoy these games so much. I like how a player can come back from behind in a moments notice just by getting a few good contracts. The map itself is pretty tight especially moving north; the fight for the north was a lot of fun and frustrating which was great! I also really enjoy the discussion generated by these games, namely the humour. After dumping a load of tourists to gain some speed (variant rule), my opponent remarked on what that would actually look like in the real world. Or dumping a load of fish by some random small town. Or some of the contracts appearing quite strange due to where your rail is getting its goods from. All in all a lot of fun. British Rails is great for two players. Havent tried 3 yet.

Not my favorite crayon rail.  Smaller board makes for more congested play, which is not bad.  It just takes more planning. But, the slower train are just painful.

Got in 2007

Strategy - Jute in Dundee and Clay in Plymouth are the big money items.  Tobacco in Bristol, Fruit in Hereford, Chemicals in Ayr and Tourist in London are also important.  Carrying extra of these items can be very helpful.  Upgrade to a 12 movement train as soon as possible.

I'm pretty much always up for any of the Empire Builder series of games.  This is one of the ones that I prefer for 2-player (which is what most of my games are).  It looks as though things could get really dicey with 3+.  As it stands, there is enough of a challenge finding routes between the two of us, which causes a little more conflict than in straight Empire Builder. [8]
------------------------------------------------
Apparently I rated this higher in the past because of its use as a two-player map.  While I think it is still good for that, they all seem to play pretty well with two players.  Beyond that, I find that I am rarely all that interested in playing this one.  This was supposedly re-balanced to give a lot of the East-West routes more of a chance.  As far as I can tell, this really hasn't happened.  There are vast areas of the board no one ever wants to visit when we play.  That to me is a problem.  True, this occurs in other titles, but in this one, this area ends up being a substantial portion of the playable area. [05/24/2009]

What took me so long to discover the overwhelming fun that is a crayon rail game!? I know, it was the time to play one that kept me away. Don't make the same mistake... the time is immaterial when you're as immersed in the game as you are by these games.

I never thought my husband would sit still for a game that can last 2, 3, even 4 hours as our first one did. But he not only endured it, he loved it. And though my head is spinning from staring at a shiny board full of dots, I want to play it again... right now!

British rails is a game that I have loved since the first time I played it, back when I had only played a handful of games ever. It was one of my first strategy games. It's too long, it's quite possible for players to lose in the first couple of turns. It has a huge runaway winner problem. Yet I love it and I wish I could get other folks to play it with me. It's so satisfying to make a plan and count out your money and scout a route to maximize your profit. I really wish this game had a new edition to iron out some of its wrinkles, but I will never stop loving it.

British Rails is a crayon rail game. I had never played a crayon game before and wasn't sure what to expect. It's largely the same as many other rail games except your drawing a path rather than placing hex tiles to mark your path. There's the same type of building cost/terrain penalties that you see in other games. BR is purely a pick-up and delivery route building game.

Your goal is to get 250 million pounds, and build a route to the four major cities. On a turn you move your single train and then either build route or upgrade your train. Trains can be upgraded to move faster or hold an extra good.

You start with 3 demand cards each of which shows three possible deliveries. The demand and production of goods is fixed in every game, so you'll always know that Jute is produced in the far north and will sell well in the south. Trying to jump into a game for the first time is a little rough as you have to constantly refer to where things are produced and whether those goods are widely available or rare. Just finding places was difficult for me. Luckily there were handy cheat sheets or I would have been completely lost.

As soon as you fulfill a demand you discard the card and get a replacement. Trying to work out the puzzle of how to make multiple cards synergize is really the hardest part of this game. You'll want to find a way to combine traveling to a delivery with picking up something you can deliver elsewhere. That's often tricky when you have to factor in 9 possible deliveries along with checking where those goods are produced and comparing their distances to each other and to established routes. After the game I was mentally wiped and had a bit of a headache.

The other big challenge of the game is deciding on routes. While you'll want to build routes to deliveries, you have to think long term about what will be most efficient for future deliveries. In the early game you might spend as much, or more, to build a route as you'll make from your deliveries to that spot, but you're building an infrastructure. Later in the game you'll want to avoid building as much as possible and try to maximize your existing routes. Picking your deliveries will often have to take into account these route considerations... making those decisions all the harder.

I really enjoyed the game even though it was overwhelming. I think it would be a lot easier once I figure out where things are and remember all the resource peculiarities (Sugar is only grown in Lincoln, Fruit is only grown in Hereford, Coal is everywhere, etc.)

I love the concept of crayon rail games, and this is the only one I own, so this rating is kind of for the whole list of crayon rail games.

Building the networks is fun.  Using crayons is fun.  Making the deliveries successfully is fun.  But, unfortunately the whole experience is not.  Most of my turns feel extremely simple.  I know in advance exactly what I am going to do, and could explain in advance what I will do in 5 seconds.  But, then it takes a full 1-2 minutes to carry out the turn!  Adding up the cost just takes too long!

As a result, you have a lot of downtime while playing, and when you finish the game, you realize you spent 2.5 hours playing, but the game was only about as deep as a 45 minute game would be.  

I know that a computerized version exists, and this may be the solution, I don't know.  I don't think I could convince my friends to play a computerized version.    I really want to be a huge fan, but I just can't be.

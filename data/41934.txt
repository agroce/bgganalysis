Disclaimer: I playtested this game.  A great WaW product... rules have been clarified and the activation passing issue has been addressed, some new twists [leaders, a couple of on board arty units], lots of units and many rather interesting ones, scenarios cover a range of topics, so all in all a lot of fun to play.

RATING: 9.8
The variety of countries available in The Untold Stories drew me into purchasing this as my first "serious" wargame.  Great components (maps, counters, dice) complimented by some very cool looking scenarios. The rating will go up as I get more plays in, but only until I have more experience with the game.

In my first play through I struggled mainly with the chit drawing and figuring out how that worked alongside the status markers (ops complete, ammo depleted, etc.). Combat was a bit shaky but a few more plays should hopefully iron that out. Played a brief custom wargame exercise involving the Canadians (PPCU) and the entire West German forces on map C.

I have since upped my rating after getting in 3 scenarios (of which I posted 3 AAR's for on the game's session sub-forum). It is a LOT of fun and I've enjoyed every moment of this game/system. I also highly recommend getting some Litko playing aid pieces, they add so much flavor to the game.

Quality of components is almost identical to Blood'n'Bridge but the very (very!) good batch of scenarios and the number of nations in this box makes TUS my favorite WaW title so far !

RATING: 9.25
A 9+ for this game series practically across the board.

It rarely fails me when I want a quick-playing session of modern-era warfare--complete with a chaotic and deadly (cardboard) battlefield. Helos, chem strikes, mech infantry, a multi-national order of battle (TUS in particular), air support, air mobility, and yah, tanks and infantry. All in a easy-to-digest compact set of rules.

TUS, as mentioned above, brings an excellent level of diversity to the mix with the variety of NATO allies and WP nations, which is a good part of its appeal for me. Playing with, and against, Danes, Belgians, Canadians, East Germans, and Poles successfully conveys the scope of the retro-speculative WWIII history and spares players the need to *always* play U.S. versus U.S.S.R. scenarios. 

And in that, you get little scenarios well-suited for quick, in-between sessions (such as the first scenario), mid-sized stuff that plays pretty well solo (4th scenario), and big meeting engagements with lots of armor (third scenario).

I dig the system, and I dig the people who make and support it.

The whole physical package is quite impressive and the introduction of geomorphic maps is a nice step towards more generic (and open) scenarios. Rules have been streamlined and are quite stable now. My only quibble would be about some scenarios stretching reality (or at least the kind of reality you would expect in a WW3 setting) beyond what is reasonable (east german troops attacking polish forces?!?!?). Again, the playing experience remains very good.

Played a game of solitaire to get acquainted with the rules.  But once I master them, this has become my favorite out of the entire WaW series!

The boards are inferior compared to Blood & Bridges, although the price is high ($65).

The rulebook is now in B&W instead of color.

Disappointing...

 Rules are an improvement with new features and weapon systems. Ready to play this bad boy.
After extensive play this is likely the best module bar Into the Breach.

This set of scenarios surprised me - They were much more fun than I anticipated. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Too much luck dependent for my taste. Not only by rolling dice, but mostly becouse of chit pull mechanics. One bad draw can ruin your game. Also first scenarios that I played don't seem to be well balanced.
Still very thematic, and you can play Polish army.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
A great addition to the WaW series.  Has over 500 counters with large contingents of East Germans, Poles. and Canadians.  The three geo-morphic mapboards are very useful.  The scenarios are some of the best in the series.

RATING: 8
Who knew dice rolling would be so much fun?  I thought that the fictional setting would make for uninspiring scenarios, but how wrong I was.  Incredible scenario design with asymetrical forces makes each battle a joy to play.  Of particular note is scenario 4 where a lone west german supertank platoon with minimal support defends against a hoard of crappy polish armour.

Was fortunate enough to be able to playtest this module.  The scenarios are great and have a variety of situations.  The module has a great variety of forces and counters, and includes three geomorphic boards.  Component production is great.  I think Scenario 12 could possibly be the best scenario in the entire WaW Series.

RATING: 7
I become more interested in the modern weapon and technology differentiation between NATO and the Soviets with this series.  Simple game system but it simulates the differentiation neatly without much burden.  It is fun to use the longer range NATO gun to blast the Soviets from a distance, while seeing the Soviets coming up in hoardes!  Hope more different Warsaw Pact units coming up in future too. I just jope that the designer would have patched up some of the ambiguities in the rules.  Then it will be perfectly alright.

First play rating, took almost till the end of the game to really grok the rules with my opponent and I. We both enjoyed it though, will probably go up once we play again to cement the rules. Learning a new system is always like this though.

RATING: 9
Probably one of my favorite fast-playing systems. Chit-pull is great for F2F or solitaire, the components are top-notch, the rules are simple yet detailed, and the theme is brilliant. 

Every wargamer should at least try this if not own it (or it's WWII cousin Nations at War).

I bought this game two years ago.
During three months, a lot of my friends came at home, had a beer and played this game with me.
Ok I loose my girlfriend because of this, as she was upset by all these comings and goings, but what a great game experience, that's worth it.

Thank you Mark.


PS : and don't be alarmed, I've found a new girlfriend.

NATO versus Warsaw Pact... more scenarios, more maps, lots of counters... components aren't up to Blood and Bridges standards but are still nicely done...

RATING: 7
Plays fast, bloody and fun. Quick to learn, easy rules hampered by a rulebook that could be better laid out. Pretty counters, but the map seems cartoonish. Wide variety of scenarios - some are gamey or dicey. Many scenarios pose interesting strategic or tactical challenges. Easy to get on the table, generally worth it when you get it there. 

Cons: highly abstracted, very random/dicey, and some weird OOB choices in the scenarios. Why are the ATGM tracks attached to the tank company rather than the infantry? Why are the mortar units for the mechanized infantry on foot, with no transport?

Excellent.  What a nice, balanced system.  Smooths out some of the EBG rules and adds some good well-balanced scenarios.  Marine units are interesting.  Beautiful components; counters hard on old eyes but worth it.  Many decisions are necessary.  Subtlety of game may be lost on some.  Scary looking dice as usual, but not as bad as EBG.  ;-)

RATING: 7
As a WaW game, this one continues the series with more of the same albeit a few rule changes.  I downgrade my rating based on the component quality.  Compared to their previous release of EG and B&B, the component quality is worse.  I'll go so far as to say "It's not Scottish" if you know what I mean.  The boards are thinner and one's already warping.  The counters could have been upgraded to the font quality found in White Star Rising but weren't.  The rules are in B&W.  The dice are poor quality.  Still, if you like the system there are plenty of new units and scenarios to keep you fighting NATO against Warsaw Pact troops for a long time.

This is the Game to get if you want to learn the rules for the series, flat out. Use these rules to play all the other games in the system. Quick play, fun, and gives a good feel for Command & Control because of the chit draw system.

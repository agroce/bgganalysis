There are a lot of things going on in this game.  there are lots of roads to victory and some interesting economics.  The biggest thing is the A/B action selection, which really makes long-term planning important but also difficult.  A lot of tension, and a lot of interaction.  This one is a keeper.

RATING: 7.5
Another Martin Wallace game with some very interesting mechanics -- this time, an "A" and "B" turn. In the "A" turn, you select actions by claiming them with Action Discs... in the "B" turn, you claim the action by removing the disc. I find the setup very fiddly -- similar to Brass. Once past that, it works very well, and provides you with a variety of interesting choices -- some excruciatingly difficult to resolve... which is, as we know, what we love about a great Martin Wallace game.

I'm still forming an opinion on this one, so my rating will change over time. This is where it starts for now (7.5).

Rating is based on our annual play of RoE.  I love the arc of the game and the stabby nature of the end game.  It's not a 10 for me, as I only want to play this once or twice I year, but I do love it when I do.

THANK YOU SECRET SANTA 2009!

A decent, light civ game with all the essentials: trade, war, area control, resource management, technology and urbanization.

Update 5/2010:
Dropped the rating from 8 -> 7
The game just tries to be too much and ends up not having a soul.

Update 2010/12:
I thought it would be appropriate to donate this game to a loving home. For me who has already seen quite many games, RoE just doesn't offer enough. But for players at the beginning of their boardgaming career this could be a crown jewel and thbus gain immortality. 7->6

RATING: 8.5
I really like this.  It's typical Wallace - lots of ways of winning and stacking up potentialities for victory and it can be hard to see who's winning.  I think it's right up there with Perikles (which it's heavier than) and Struggle of Empires (which it's lighter than).  My only grumble would be that it's a much longer game than the 150 mins suggested on the box.  Try adding on an hour or even more to that...but I think when we play it again we will use an egg timer - maybe 1 min for each action unless it's a battle/cube placement in which case you get 3, or something like that.

A very good mixture of worker-placement cum war-ish game that taxes the brain power to re-act to the ever changing environment.

Would consider this a heavy eurogame that would be enjoyed by gamers that like a longer challenge in complexity and diplomatic resolutions.

Not for the light eurogamers.

Light civilization game (3-4 hours)? Sounds intriguing! This sounds like it will work with our hard-core gaming group. Best with 3 players, gets really long if with more. May not purchase, since it may have limitations for getting it played (3 players that is).

Rise has a lot of little neat ideas. But I'm not sure if its flow would get too samey with repeated play. The tug of war for leadership gets pretty intense towards the end with a bit of a bash the leader scripted into how the players will be motivated to act.

I like the variety of things you can do besides fight for territory control and the unique action selection system. However, territory control is still the main and plain of how you get points. I wish the rest of it were a bit more developed.

Reasonably well implemented historical civilization game. All the systems mesh well, there's some tension trying to think ahead for the back side of every turn, and it has a lot of paths to earn victory points. No good with only two, but great with four.

Nothing screams innovative about it, but it's solid and worthy expenditure of two to three hours.

A resource management / area control light civ game, that reminds me a bit of mare nostrum and struggle of empires. Very balanced and robust but as with all area control games the interaction and the kingmaking didn't let me enjoy this game to its full potential.

RATING: 8
After 1 play. Well its not at all bad, not earth shattering either. Less complex than TtA, less "fiddly". Also less "fiddly and shorter than "CIV" Pehaps not as good as either, but it fills a 2 - 4 hr slot CIV game reasonably well. Suspect 3 - 4 player will be optimal for player interaction vs downtime.
The board position does seem to be the most important aspect, but you need the off board tiles or the board play stalls rapidly.
Typical Wallace game....you simply cannot ignore any one aspect of gameplay, if you do then often you come very unstuck mid - late game

This is quite a strange game. It was marketed as a sort of Civilization "light" game, but it is not at all! It is an area control game, with some elements of resource management and various ways to score points. It's a strange beast to manage, and it surely deserves many plays but I fear it would seat unplayed for a while due to its lenght...

Initial Impression: This Martin Wallace game can be a real brainburner. The mechanism of determining actions requires that you plan many moves in advance. That one mechanism gives this area placement game a really innovative feel.

RATING: 8
Looks again like a very strong game from Wallace. Because of time lack we didn't finish our first game, but everybody agreed to play it again. In fact the game isn' t very difficult to learn, but hard to win.

Second play : The game's good but heavy and long. Because of the same actions in round a and b sometimes it's very hard to plan your actions. Nice idea but dangerous for mistakes. Still a good strategic game.

RATING: 5
The A-B thing is great.  During the A-Turn, players alternate choosing 6 actions by placing discs on the corresponding action line from left to right.  Then during the B-Turn, players are forced into playing those same actions from right to left.  However, players get to choose the order in which they resolve those actions.  If 1 or more of your opponent's discs are to the right of your disc, you are forced into paying a cost for your action.

Other than the A-B thing, the remaining stuff is just average.  I'd play again to see if the A-B thing can keep me interested enough to explore the stuff that's not "rising" above an average Wallace game.  Right now I much prefer Struggle of Empires.

Pretty deep, a lot of options and trade-offs. It will take several plays before figuring out viable strategies. Very nice, I don't regret the purchase.

RATING: 8.5
Initial impression.  I thought the components in the Phalanx edition, although very high quality materials, were at times difficult to see due to the muddy colors running into each other.  On close examination of an individual component you would notice that the artwork was very well executed.

The only other issue I had was the endgame effect in which the last few moves could be calculated out to the last decimal place since all the information is face up in front of all the players.  This could create AP in a person and would be frustrating for the rest.  

That being said, if you have a good group to play with the game is quite a lot of fun.  We do have a good group of Martin Wallace fans so the game is quite enjoyable thus far.

RATING: 7
4-player solo.  Hmmmmm. Well, yeah, love the mirrored turn mechanism - makes ya think quite a bit. A bit of a problem with the muted colors/print - hard to "read" the tiles and differentiate them. That mutedness lends to the "heavy" feel of the game.  Also, the idea of innovation/discovery comes across quite abstractly - first place, the tiles seem to small relative to the other types of tiles (it gives the impression that these are much less important, when, thematically, I'd like them to be more important - disconcerting).
But, still, there's a meaty game here - got some serious exploring to do.

RATING: 8
First Play: Initial impressions are that the zone control for primary and secondary points are a well trodden path. Next the progress chits has been done so many times before and these benifits are somewhat lame and uninspired. The action allocation system there and back again is quite inovative, but all in all I felt that although I really should have liked this, it was dry and lacked any real soul. Very like After the Flood, like in part to Age of Empires III, I struggled with this one. We played for over 3 hours with constant need to reference and cross reference the rules and only completed 2 eras. I was glad when the offer was then made to call it a day.


2nd Play: I am embarrassed at how much my opinion has changed. This time the game fell into place, the pace was faster, it all seemed to make sense and I found it a much more challenging and enjoyable experience. I'm thinking that I really should buy this now.

Jan 2010 Bought.

Subsequent plays and it is a good one. New players must write off first game as a learning experience.

This one felt like a blend of SoE and Endeavor to me. Since those are two of my favorite games, it's not surprising to me that I really enjoyed this game. It plays a little longer, but I'm sure with repeat plays it would diminish somewhat. It felt very well balanced and while you do have to look up each new tile that comes out, it wasn't overly complex or a brain burner like some of his other recent titles.

This game takes the implant of Struggle for Empire and modify it adding land tiles to produce resources as in caylus.
The result is a game worst than SoE, that has a better and more realistic theme. The back and forth turn is not enough to make this game shine. I prefer much the alliance bidding in SoE, that provides a solution to the kingmaker issue that RoE has.
Here there is a mess of different resources, but these are never costrained, nor there is the need of a tight management.
The VP are made with area control and buildings, but these grow exponentially in the three ages. First age provides 10% and even less than the total VP.
Why play it? It adds unnecessary lenght to an already  long game.
To sum it up, Struggle of Empire is a better game.

Long and stressful game. I am slightly frustrated with all long games just now, just don't have time for them, but the overall quality of the game impresses me nevertheless. Based on two plays I give the game an 8. This is a game for those who enjoy unforgiving and complex games and is a must for any Wallace afficionado.

Update: Still a good game, but too long to get played most of the time. Lowering to 7, since I would often pick another game even if I had the time and players.

Not a bad game, but I prefer Struggle of Empires to this one. The rules are not easy to teach, and the game mechanics don't gel as well as they could. The paths to victory are not as varied as I first thought.

2009, area control, axn pt allow, var phase order, M. Wallace.

Others say:
Too long, abstract and unengaging... mostly pushing cubes around and maximizing points for 4+ hours.  Less nation identity/customization as in Struggle of Empires or Princess of the Renaissance, less thematic than Liberte, Byzantium, or After the Flood.  Action drafting/ area majority game in which you build an abstract and crude economic engine, and push cubes around a fairly ugly map.  If you get behind early, you're going to be a spectator for 3+ hours.  Every two turns, the board basically resets itself. So, it feels a bit like playing three games of El Grande consecutively.  The A/B decline mechanism is clever, and game mechanics play out okay, but Endeavor scratches this type of empire/civ-building itch in 1/3 of the time.

RATING: 9
Another of Martin's "let me dazzle you with the array of tiles there are in this game!" What other designers/publishers do with cards, Martin does with tiles. The theme is epic in scope - the expansion of civilization from the Mediterranean area to the rest of the world. The object is to build the most successful empire, as measured by VPs that are accumulated through a variety of means.

The map would quickly remind you of such games as: "History of the World," or his own "Struggle of Empires." The flow of the game and some of the mechanics seem more akin to "El Grande" or "Puerto Rico," but much more thematic. There are some typical Wallace "hooks" (the mirror-structured action sequence) but essentially the idea is to develop an engine to produce VPs.

The Phalanx production values are in full evidence, and the rules are well* presented, complete with a partial game turn example. This has all the appearance of another (reasonably) well thought out strategic board game by a master of the (almost well thought out) genre. Rating is preliminary - stay tuned...
* Ok, maybe not so well as I thought :p 
------
Well, we are seeing some order being imposed on the flurry of questions that arose around the rules. The minimalist approach failed again. I'm satisfied with the resolution of most of the issues and am hopeful that this game will start to get the respect I think it deserves.
------
Finally got this on the table! It didn't disappoint. Five players, first time for all of us, and the playing time was about four hours. This suits us just fine and the rules clarifications helped as well (no arguments). Obviously, this game is going to take some "playing into" which is fine with us as well. Rating wasn't far off - going up a notch. I expect this will see regular play.

RATING: 4
Thought I'd love this - by about 30 minutes in I was so wishing I was either playing Struggle of Empires or Through the Ages.

I thought it would be strategic, it wasn't really, just the usual area control game intermingled with 'buy stuff' to get stuff resource management game. With an Empire game I want to be able to think about it, plan my approach and then try to implement my plan in the game, in this one that's not really possible as you're driven by what tech advances appear when. 6 actions that you draft and then in effect use in both A and B of the era, sounded cool - but wasn't really, as the second part is a blind call, you won't know what tech or territories are available, nor will you have much idea what the board will be like. 

And the first era seems rather pointless, I scored 14 VPs in the first era (7 in A, 7 in B) and won with something like 140 at the end ... just deal out some stuff as a starting empire (or draft it or something) and play just the final 2 eras and shave a chunk of play time off for no real loss.

Finally, I can see this sliding into AP hell with some and also suffer from kingmaking on the last turn ... 

Some interesting ideas, but for me misses the mark - needed a bit more development. Wanted it when I first heard about it, glad I tried before purchase, now I'm not interested in owning a copy.

** Update, played again and even less enthusastic this time around - just don't find the game that gripping and the whole random availability of techs annoys me rather than giving me an interesting challenge, and the A/B mechanic just leads to AP while people try to predict what the heck they're going to need in 'B' (rather impossible I think). Now at a stage I'd rather not play this again ... rating lowered.

RATING: 5
There are some clever mechanics here but a game of this length needs to have a stronger theme to keep me engaged. As it is, I felt like I was just pushing around cubes and maximizing points the entire game (4+ hours)with no real sense of progress of growth. It bills itself as a civ-game but that's being pretty flexible with the term. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Decent enough action selection euro with significant
actual interaction. Nothing really groundbreaking here,
and the hard to read tiles probably cost it a little in rating. 

The 'special sauce' on this one is forcing the players
to take the same actions again in the second era. 
It's a clever mechanism, but not enough to make the whole 
game particularly special. Just forces some preplanning
and requires that players be familiar with the entire
tile manifest (not all of which is presented in the 
play aids).


For a supposed 'civ' game, the technologies don't interrelate 
any better than does the board position. This is little
more than an abstract optimization problem - but an interesting
one.

One play. Nice civ game that though heavy, is one of those that is worth the three hour experience. One small "drawback" is the familiar mechanics/appearance, with little new to add. But the borrowing is well done (El Grande, AoE III, Endeavor). Also, the theme suffers slightly in trying to cover too much history. The action selection track is an interesting adaptation of Endeavor's shipping lane (or the other way around?). I would prefer Endeavor to RoE, due to the beautiful simplicity of the former, and length of play.

The rating may be unfair, but my initial impression is not very positive - you are bidding for position and sets of hidden tiles (so it really is a blind bid). Furthermore, we did not finish the game because two players started to argue over one rule. Man, that session was a total disaster...

Interesting and exciting game, with some original ideas on how the game goes ahead. I like very much the action panel system to establish the actions and the game structure with 3 eras of two phases each. Each phase is of 6 action for player, so a player will do 36 actions in a complete game. I like also the map, however some rules are not quite well explained, especially some advances. Good civilization game.

A Wallace empire building game is always something to look forward to and this didn't dissapoint.  While the rules and mechanics aren't too complex the multifaceted interactions means this is at the meaty end of the scale.  Our first game was long - around four hours actual playing time - but it should speed up with experience to around the 180 minutes quoted on the box and worth a extra point or more if so.

RATING: 6
The coolest thing here is definitely the mirrored turn element, where you end up taking all the same actions in turn B of an era as you did in turn A, taking them in a mirrored fashion unless you decide to take them out of order.  It's a fresh mechanic that really makes you think about what actions you're taking.

Other than that, it's a pretty neat game of area control and engine building.  There are several resources to manage in order to score points in several areas, and it all comes together very nicely.  All in all, it's a well-designed game but I'm not sure I had a ton of fun playing it.  I'd still be happy to pull it out now and again, though.

Just  played a run through of the game and I relatively enjoyed it. Each action gives you lots of options and requires deep planning.  Unfortunately the game came be rather unforgiving and it is easy to fall behind if you make a couple of poor choices early on.  Though the components are well made, the colors are a bit bland and dull for my tastes.

RATING: 5
Updated 5/23/10.
Played with: 2, 3.
Length: 2.5 hours

Rise of Empires is, sadly, at the lower end of my 6s.  I purchased it because my wife expressed interest in a civilization-themed game (she loves games that involve "building things").  In all honesty, however, this is not a civilization game.  It is a lengthy Area Control game that has some distracting civilization trappings.  That alone doesn't make it a bad game, but it wasn't what we were expecting. 

[u]The Bad:[/u]

Length: At 2.5 hours per game, Rise of Empires is firmly in (or exceeding) the territory of some great games (Le Havre, Shipyard, Agricola, Brass).  The windows of opportunity for such a game is rare in our household, and thus RoE is not a game that comes off the shelf often.   

Downtime: There is a lot of communal downtime counting food, cubes, coins, disks, and victory points every turn.  You kind of have to trust your opponents to be honest and count their own, or the game would go on forever.  My wife prefers for me to count for her, as she sometimes misses things. 

Theme: The game is very gamey.  You feel like you are playing a game, rather than building or expanding an empire.  Our most recent game was the most thematic, but it takes some real effort to step back and evaluate your civilization.  I think the game would have benefitted from a tech tree of some kind.  As it stands, only a few of the progress tiles (representing cultural developments) are related to your pre-existing civilization.  I would have preferred to see some developmental pre-requisites, or more tiles that only work with X number of cities. 

Scoring: The first two games have had a runaway leader problem.  There are some minor catch-up mechanisms, but if you're more than 30 victory points behind, things are just going to get worse. 

Balance: The general consensus is that the player with the largest population is going to win.  The board just has too many opportunities for points relative to cities and developments. 

[u]The Good:[/u]

The game is actually fun to play, despite some of the flaws above.  It has enough decision space that you are usually left pondering your mistakes for a few hours after the game ends.  Once it is out and set up, we almost always want to play again immediately (but never have time, see above).  Importantly, it seems that the game balance gets better with more players (we've not had the opportunity for more than a three-player game).  This is because there is less space per person on the board, which means that it becomes a less-viable source of points.

[u]The Verdict:[/u]
If you're really into civilization-themed games, and you're looking for a two-hour cube-pusher that will make you think, plan, and regret your mistakes, this could be the game for you.  I'd recommend starting with the 4- or 5-player version of the game, just to see if the right balance is there for you before you buy.  But as a 2- or 3-player game, it's not one that lives up to Martin Wallace's reputation, nor one that (for me at least) deserves the high average rating.

One play so far but it is not a game I am willing to invest the time in to try again. It feels like a hotchpotch of many ideas from other games and the sum of the parts do not add up to a better game but one that is overly-long, clunky and abstract with little narrative. 

The A and B move mechanic is clever but not really much fun. The empire tiles provide lots of opportunities for screwage and kingmaking, both of which I dislike intensely. The board is rather unattractive and the icons are not particularly intuitive. The 'discoveries' (eg. television) don't seem to relate to the game in any way. They just serve as a dull alternative way to earn VPs.

Fun stuff going on for an area influence game dressed up as a civ game.  Not sure if there is enough unique parts to really givfe me an itch to play it often.  The neat action selection locking you into a set of actions for the subsequent turn should have really factored into my play, but at first play, it didnt' seem like it did.

Τhe younger not so inspired not so brilliant not so interesting brother of Struggle of Empires. The lack of theme now is too obvious and some rules are absolutely ridiculus (cities with to land - maybe in space). If it was published before SoE I would say "A very good game" and SoE would be "the brilliant new game of Wallace". Now we have a mediocre effort.

-1 for rules that are conflicting and ambiguous. Maybe if I ever get a clear authoratative clarification on all open issues I'll give the 1 pt back. 

Still, the game is really good. It feels like Struggle of Empires minues the dice and alliances. And what it adds is a nifty "A/B" thing where do actions and mark them, then do them again as you "unwind". I feel like I could get this on the table more than SoE, but curiously playing this makes me want to bust out SoE. Hmmm...

Good military domination game.  The A/B track is a very cool game mechanic which forces players to plan well in advance for their game moves across turns.  The rules were a little convoluted, making learning the finer points of the game more difficult.  this game has it all - politics, technology, building empires - and it plays in a long evening.  All in all, this is a heavy euro style game worth giving a try.  And the dynamics of expansion and control will make the war gamer in you happy.

Bought it as soon as it shipped, and as with most of my wanted games, I was partially let down.
My main problems are:
1) Area Majority: I expected tiles could act as a sort of counter balance wrt Area Majority control. But it wasn't so. Area majority is the way to win the game. Tiles are only helpers.
2) Civilization theme. It isn't there. You can't feel your civilization expanding, you can't breathe it.
3) Tiles powers. 1st era Cities are so underpowered they are a joke. Whoever gets them is behind in turn order for the 2nd era. After every era you get the same sort of tiles with growing powers, with small variety.
All these aspects make me prefer Struggle of Empires to this title, while I expected the opposite. It's another game with that bash the leader aspect due to area majority control, like El Grande / Struggle of Empires and the rest. IMO, this is a lost opportunity for this game, not bad, but not even so good.

RATING: 7.5
I don't know what to think of the "mirror mechanic": you have to perform the same actions in both the A and B part of an era; it's a nice idea, but in some way I feel uncomfortable by being bound; having map dominance is too important compared with taking tiles; theme is totally pasted-on; nice game box, but it does not have to do anything with the game IMO; despite this, it is still fun playing.

Otro gran juego de Martin Wallace, y van ya ... En fin, me encanta, es un Eurogame puro y duro, con tema de civilizaciones, pero que nadie espere un juego civilifláutico. Se juga por Eras, tres eras en concreto, y cada Era son dos turnos, turno A y B. Tienes seis acciones a elegir en cada turno A, mientras que en los turnos B no eliges acciones, ya que son un espejo del turno A, todo lo que hagas/selecciones en el turno A lo repetirás en el turno B. Mecánica genial alrededor de la que gira todo el juego, junto con, por supuesto, el mapa. Mayorías para puntuar el mapa, y también puntos de victoria a través de otros elementos del juego (ciudades y otras losetas). Varios tipos de recursos que manejar para conseguir tus objetivos (señores que irán al mapa o al mantenimiento de ciudades, recursos, comida y monedas). Es algo caótico como todo juego de mayorías, si todo el mundo te sacude no ganarás te pongas como te pongas, por lo que es conveniente no destacar demasiado pronto.

Uno de mis favoritos, un clásico instantáneo.

Difficult to gauge from just one 3-player game. While enjoyable, it seemed to be fiddly, and unclear on some rules. The production quality is outstanding, and you get a lot of wood and cardboard in this game. I'd like to play this more, as it seems there is a lot of fun to be had with this one. 

Rulebook is very poorly written. Lots of things in the FAQ that should have been clarified in the rules. Such a long FAQ for the short rulebook it has.

Longer, more complex, and less deterministic than Endeavor, while shorter, simpler, and more deterministic than Struggle of Empires.  It lacks the (admittedly light) historical simulation value of SoE, but the gameplay experience is far deeper than that of Endeavor.

The downside is that for a long game, it can be a little fragile -- If getting left behind 30 minutes into a 3-hour game is not something you can handle, then this is probably not a game for you.  It can be very hard to come back from an early mistake (and very easy to blow it with a late one).  It's your own fault, though -- there are almost no random elements to the game.  (Trust me, I speak from experience!)

Decent, quick civ game. Not as interesting as [i]Struggle of Empires[/i], with one player even describing the game as "soulless" at one point, but then it's not as long, either. More likely to appeal to eurogamers than SoE, if that's your crowd. Some odd rules quirks and contradictions, but nothing serious.

After one play (4 players) - I really liked this despite some rules ambiguities around New-World/Far-East expansion. It captures the feel of Civ development with a genuine positional map, using an easily digestible rule set that still presents a raft of possible strategies and tactical possibilities.   

The action/drafting mechanic is interesting (though a little gamey) and the combat resolution mechanism is excellent.

Second play (4-player) it does run a bit long - however it was essentially a first play for all of us and there was a little AP in some quarters. I still admire the design and it does provide a civ game with tech development, economic and miltary issues to be considered, plus a map in a playable time frame. 3-player may be a bit more manageable.

Rating dropped from 9 to 8

I almost didn't buy this game based on the conflicting impressions from this forum but I'm glad I took the gamble and got it!

Played one full game today with three players and my initial impressions are VERY favourable. 

This game has many interesting mechanics - some quite unique - and they actually seem to hang together to make an absorbing engaging game.

Can't wait to try it again. 9 of 10 for now.

RATING: 6
Long game (4h with four players). I think this game suffers from the same problems as most game in this category. You must bash the leader at all times even if it's not in your best interest to do so. If players do what's actually best for them you'll probably have a runaway leader problem and have to sit out the last two hours despite already knowing who'll win.

I like some of the mechanics in the game such as the reversing of actions. You first have an A round where all players perform six actions, then in the B round you do the actions again but in reversed order more or less. Makes for some interesting planning.

Typical Wallace game to me, a bit too unpolished to be really good.

Truly awful graphic design hamstrings what could be a really great game.  The tech chits are unreadable and the city tiles are actively misleading.  But the activation system is really cool.  And while it tries to do euro-war better than "lose units one to one so all other players win", with 0 kills 2, who would ever want to go in to a region first?

RATING: 5
Players build up an empire of territory, progression, cities and land over the course of six turns.  Players take turns to take actions, which gain territory, progress, cities, trade or deploy population cubes out onto a world map.  At the end of each of the six turns players gain or lose food, as well as gaining gold, victory points, population and resources.  Repeat for six turns, with the points ramping up as the game plays out.  Weird game - certainly quite clean and straightforward mechanically, but several problems keep it from becoming great.  Good stuff includes the switchback action mechanism, which really makes you think and does provide some anguish.  Bad stuff ... well, a real catch the leader problem - you have no hope in making ground as leaders simply shadow what you do.  Exert pressure on a leader in one direction, they'll easily counter you.  You need a reliable ally, or be condemned to being a spectator over a 3-4 hour game.  Graphically, quite ugly too.  Reminded me strongly of El Grande, with bits of Struggle of Empires bolted on - and not as good as either game.  Endeavor and Age of Empires III do the progress/expansion thing much better.  Typical Wallace for me - interesting to try, but too many warts.

[1 unfinished play] Why do I play Martin Wallace games?  It's not the hope that someday he'll do one I like, because he already has.  I should just keep playing Liberte and avoiding the new ones.
I've reached the point where I get that sinking feeling every time someone opens a box and takes out a map of the world (or western Europe) that's divided into little Risk-y-looking compartments. I simply am not interested in games about reliving the golden age of European imperialism.

RATING: 7
This is an interesting one that piles up a lot of common and pleasing mechanics and sticks them around a really interesting action selection mechanic.  There's a lot to do, and you don't feel quite sure it's balanced, because of the usual Wallacian tile flood (which I miss in the Treefrog games).  The biggest failing of the game is that the theme isn't worked in enough to feel important, and although the game pushes you into specializations, they are not clear enough to give personality to the empires.  It ends up feeling like a cube-pusher and disc-placer, though a good one.  Wallace is best with games that feel full of his iconoclastic warmth and cheer, but this one feels a little heartless.

Early return says much more fun than Antike though, for example.

I like this game more than some of Wallace's other games, even though I certainly see similarities.  The mechanics of the reversing role order is unique, and one I enjoyed.

Attractive with good art work.  With 5 took a long time to play.  Liked better with 3.

One of my favorite Wallace games.

Game notes:  Food production (territories) ='s maintenance of cities that give VP's each round. Wonders extra VP's but don't need maintenance.  Also cities don't need maintenance.  As with many games, a balancing act.  Choose islands with accompanying Progress tiles.  Most important territory in beginning game--Mediterranean.  Most important move of game--be last person, last move, take Empire tile.

Veramente troppo lungo per quello che offre. Si vede che è un design invecchiato male. Il solito area control con maggioranze che danno punti e bonus, il tema è inesistente. L'interazione diretta fa si che uno possa venire spazzato via dalla mappa ed un altro fare una enorme quantità di punti con pochi cubetti. Il sistema di azioni è simpatico, ma niente di che. Downtime che ti fa invecchiare. Nessuna voglia di rigiocarci.

Played 3 times each with 3 players with the games lasting 3.5 hours. The game has the feel of a heavy weight Vinci / Small Worlds and like these games it can get bitchy as you generally have free choice as to where you move on the map and you are likely to have to trample on someone. If you can live with the aggression then this is a most satisfying fully engaging game. My rating may go up. June 11

Not a particularly hard game to understand, rules-wise. 

The hard thing is playing well. Decision making is hard, very hard. Not Le Havre level, but nearing it.

An other thing is combat. War is brutal. Brutal. Not a girls' game!

It is a simple formula:  Martin Wallace + Empire Building game = MUST play.

Rise of Empires is exciting, tense and filled with a myriad of tough decisions.  There are numerous factors to balance, and as in many great games, there are more actions a player desires to perform than he is allowed.  One must choose his actions carefully, but even the most careful plans can be upset by the actions of one’s opponents.  Adapting to a changing environment -- both on-board and in the various tile selections -- is a constant challenge.

Rise of Empires is a fine game that attempts to create, albeit in a fairly abstract manner, the feel of empire building.  While the absence of historical empires causes the game to feel too abstract, the progress tiles add a touch of atmosphere that does help a bit.  Still, I long for the sense of history and atmosphere that is evoked as I lead and maneuver historical empires such as the Egyptians, Syrians, Romans and Great Britain through the challenges of their eras.  

The lack of a historical atmosphere, however, doesn’t doom the game.  Rise of Empires is very engaging game that constantly challenges players with often agonizing decisions throughout its three hour duration.  As with the legendary Civilization, it forces players to pay attention to more than just warfare.  Trade, cities, progress, resources, food and finances -- all play a critical role in the success of one’s empire, and the challenge is to find the optimum combination and balance.  It is a challenge that has proven exciting and enjoyable each time I’ve accepted it, and I have no doubt it will continue to do so in the future.

Tentative rating--could go down, but more likely to go up if it warrants the playing time. The reverse action mechanic is not just a gimmick, it matters a lot, and there are lots of things to do and ways to go about doing them. It's essentially a dressed-up area-majority game, and I do like area-majority and dressing up. Rather too long, though.

Very good game. There's a lot going on, including fighting, building and strategical planning and the game consumes some time, but it's worth it.

While I can't stand "Struggle of Empires" at all, this one and "The Golden Ages" are by FAR the best civilization games out there.

A light-to-medium civ game, that really is more of an area control game than civilization game. Being a design from Martin Wallace, I was excited to pick this up and give it a try. We played with four, which seems to make area-control a better long-term strategy than city building; this should work better with five, but it is going to take awhile to get this one back to the table, as it left a bad taste in some people's mouths. The mirroring of the actions is a novel idea, but seems out of place in this game, as it makes no sense. The combat system is brutal, with the empire cards (and there were disputes about the rules), and the economic system is very simple and straightforward. There is a lot going on here, with many choices, but in the end, it seems to be about the empire cards, and not technological progress. I don't know; I need to sit with this awhile, as I know intuitively, there is a very good game in here--I just haven't found it yet.

Update (01/20/12): Now that I have Struggle of Empires also, I'm beginning to wonder if this will ever make its way to the table again? Still licking wounds from the first play.

Played once. Went for the "population booming" strategy and totally destroyed my equally unskilled opponents. (I had more points than both of them combined, I think.) I agree almost entirely with this review: http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/453710/review-after-five-plays-a-huge-disappointment

It is nice that the game isn't artificially "balanced" but it was also clear pretty well from the end that I was going to win easily barring a historic collapse.

I am much willing to cut a game some slack when it takes less than several hours.

The mirror turn thing is a nifty idea but I don't think it is really carried out to its full effectiveness in this game.

A/B action is very cool!  Playing time was a little over 1 hr per player so make a day of it.

The replayability is probably a little limited compared to, say, Struggle of Empires.

I think it's best with 4 & second best with 5 players.

[q="MULRAH"]2p variant:

1. NW Africa and Anatolia grant only one, not two, population cubes.

2. When scoring map regions, the controlling player may pick between getting the rightmost number in VPs or the resources granted by that region. If the other player is present in that region, he gets whatever the controlling player did not choose. The leftmost number is ignored.

3. When Ideology and Religion tiles are flipped, immediately remove them from the game. They provide a nice boost to the last place player in 5-player games, but essentially hand the game to the 2nd-place player (i.e., the one who hasn't built any Cities or Wonders) in a 2-player game.[/q]

I really enjoyed the first age and to some extent the second age.  By the time the third age came around, it had begun to feel a little repetitive and, well, long.  I really like area control and I think it is very well implemented here--the tiles allowing it have different capabilities and need to be correctly timed--and I liked the technology tiles, and the use of resources--in fact, nearly every element of the game is very promising.  But I wasn't sure that it was enough payoff for the 3 hours+ we spent on it.  

I also didn't like the way that options can disappear near the end, so that for instance, a player may be forced to take--and pay for, mind you--an action that s/he is not at all interested in.  (In particular, I am thinking of a city in the A phase here.)  A future play may well go more smoothly, and I'm willing to give it another chance, but I didn't have a great experience the first time around. (1 play)

This game has a boring and bland mapboard of the World. I mean hideous and ugly. The pieces are the basic wooden squares and discs which are poorly cut and painted. The Americas and Asia are depicted in two bubbles at the bottom that seem very confusing. In contrast there is a sideboard in which tiles are layed out with graphics that are almost cartoonish in nature. It's almost as if they came from a completely different game.The components are all well made and sturdy, but the overall presentation is one of the worse I have ever seen.

When Wallace misses for me, its usually by a mile.  So it is with Rise of Empires.  RoE is an overwrought area control game that feels like a conflation of the less interesting elements of El Grande with the fiddly bits of Princes of the Renaissance.  Combine that with a 4 hour playing time, and you get the sense that this title could have used some more development.

There are lots of inelegant quibbles to grouse about, but by far the most jarring is the board play.  Every two turns, the board basically resets itself.  So, it feels a bit like playing three games of El Grande consecutively (and so you could, and probably to better effect, in the time we alloted for this game).  

The tiles have an engine building quality, but this is made far less interesting by the relative abundance and fungability of commodities.  The scarcities were insufficient to real present player's with a problem to solve.  

Furthermore, there is a real divore from the boardplay and the tile collection in ways that make RoE suffer in comparision to say Puerto Rico, which has some similar elements.  If you want something global in score, yet thin on theme, try Endeavor.  You'll get 9/10ths of the punch in about 1/3rd of the time.

A very solid Wallace's design.

As usual as in Wallace's case the following features are present: striking originality, tightness, components interlock together very well and a there is a lot of factors to consider when choosing actions.

The game is a nice mix of the economic optimization of your 'civ' with the (simplified) fight over territories on the world map.  Optimization is crucial, but without the success in the area-majority portion of the game you cannot win.

EDIT: Uneven technologies and 5-player mode being way too long and chaotic are minor nitpicks.  Two factors push it for sale for me:
- the area-majority part is very important and it's hardly controllable with absolutely no guarantee what you would get out of a scuffle. 
-  after 7 plays the game has simply worn out for me and I feel that every game is similar now and there is nothing left to explore...  There is no replayability built-in and tactical manoeuvring is not varied enough to remain interesting after a few tries.  
One fresh – great, BTW - concept – of placing disks to perform actions and removing them in the mirror-like fashion (to perform the _same_ types of actions) - is not enough to make the game a keeper for me.

Sold.

Not quite as rich and unique as Wallace's other similarly-themed, tile-driven, "epic" majority game, Struggle of Empires, but this does play a bit quicker and still has plenty of interesting decisions. There are 6 turns, each of which consists of 6 actions. The turns have an ABABAB pattern whereby action disks are placed in the A phases and then removed as actions are selected in the B phases, creating, in theory, a reverse mirror image of phase A. I say "in theory" because you can pay to select actions earlier than the mirror image would dictate, and it isn't usually that expensive. However, you are pretty much stuck with the same actions, even if the order of them can be manipulated. So the A phases do require some forethought as to what you want to accomplish in the B phase. It's kinda cool, but I think it ultimately sounds cooler than it is in practice.

Downsides? It's hard to catch up if you fall behind, but I don't really see that as a flaw - just play better! Set up and break down takes a long time with all those tiles to sort. Even though you are playing on a map of the world, there are no region-specific or culturally inspired tiles, which gives the game a bit of a generic sheen. So the game is a little sterile, but the large decision tree makes it pretty engaging overall. Solid, if not great.

Slightly busy, board curiously brown. 3 seems to be the sweetspot.

I was disappointed with this game. There appear to be many decisions to be made, but actually to stand any chance you really need to be producing a lot of men to go on the board which will move you down one set path. This in turn forces the other players into sub-optimal plays and decides the game quite early.

The buildings have a really steep upkeep cost (in men on the board), so that whole side of the game turns into a VP grab in the last turn.

Some of the developments are very underwhelming (there's pretty much a clear order in which they will go irrespective of your strategy).

RATING: 6
Be wary when a new "Empires" game of Martin Wallace is announced. Get prepared for lots of gratuitous complexity, some weird rules stuff, production glitches and long long playtime decided by some more or less random decisions in the very last round.
The first rounds I enjoyed the game - develop your engine with varied civilization upgrades leaving room for different strategies, stake out claims on the map to generate resources, a clever action selection mechanism with orders in the B-round basically reversed from the A-Round and tight money management. Messing up can take a player out of the game but 4 out of 5 players performed well enough to have a say in the final kingmaking. And this is where the game breaks down for me. Our final scores were like 133/132/130/128/90. After 4 hours and lots of thinking and optimizing it all came down to single decisions that could have decided in either way. Such a close ending could be judged as a sign of a good game. But in a good game I want my own choices to decide. As is, the winner is decided by the whole group with an advantage for the players with the strongest military presence as you will need victory points from the board to win and you are more up to the mercy of other players when focussing more on city building than military might.
Within its genre, it's a good - possibly great - game as ratings show. I'll give it 6/10 for this, i.e. on par with Struggle of Empires. But my intention on playing either of them is low speaking for 4/10 which just seems too harsh for the undebatable qualities.
Game design quirks: scarcity of material without losing a word if it is intended to be limited, strange naval rules (a weakness of Wallace), cities that will never be taken by a qualified player.

Fascinating game.  It is primarily an area control game but the strategy is complex and victory points can be earned in a variety of ways.  Heavy military does not equate to domination.  There is a lot of mathematics in the game; you can often calculate your moves for maximum benefit.  There is a lot of "dick the leader" which can be frustrating but leads to a very tight and competitive game.  The board is ugly and movement between the old and new worlds can be confusing.  All in all a good game though with definite replay appeal.

Initial reaction.  Rather long, and tons of direct screwage.  Subject to a large amount of kingmaking decisions.  The tech tree was interesting.  I played with experienced players, and they warned me against playing it with 3 or 5.  

So as a 4p game only, it loses utility.  As a long game with enough complexity to rule out wins from newbies, it loses another point.  We spent 3.5 hours (including teaching), and I've seen this happen everytime 4 or more have played.  

Too long, too much kingmaking, and my enthusiasm for playing again is blunted.

Like so many Wallace games this is also a bit underrated but I do feel that the theme is a bit off.

That theme would fit the mechanics a lot better in my opinion.

Very good resource management and area control strategy game dipped in a civilisation sauce. The mix of very familiar mechanisms has been integrated with an original and interesting "mirror"-like action selection mechanism in the two rounds of each era.

Rise of Empires is another example of the trendy "more is better" philosophy in game designing. Games designed by cramming mechanism after mechanism into the them seem to garner very good geek ratings, but to me this is just plain wrong. I'd much rather play Struggle of Empires, which gives similar flavor, but is simpler, way faster (SOE has hours(!) shorter playing time) and wayyyy more fun. 

Extra minus has to be given to Rise of Empires for its poor and depressing graphics, which also are often very unfunctional (just try to understand what the tiles do by interpeting the miniscule, illogical symbols).

Very similar GAME EXPERIENCE than Struggle of Empires. Of course there are some big differences between these two (diffent kind of battle system, SoE offers diplomacy, but RoE some engine building elements), but as I said the FEEL is the same. But which one is better one? RoE's engine building element is a big plus and because of that I prefer RoE a bit better, but the battle system is bland compared to SoE's - now RoE doesn't offer any surprise elements.

So I guess there should be a mix of these two games to get a great game. Either way, both takea a LOT of time which why I play these rarely. In a same playing time I can have much more fun with the 3x 1h games.

I think I hate most Martin Wallace games because he seems to adds mechanics to his game for the only prpose of adding mechanics. Note: This review is after a 2 player game.

First, you manage various kind of resources: Cubes, Gold, Food, Black tiles, etc. And you must get sure that you never get short of these resources. There is so many different incomes, upkeep and convertions methods for each of these resources that you actually never know if you are actually getting short. It's actually a pain to plan ahead how much resources will be left.

I think  most of the complexity of the games come from the fact that there is a lot of unique stuff and some have special abilities. Most of them only gives bonus or malus to some resources. It's easy to identify, it's just the resource calculation which is painful. 

For special abilities(technology) you just need to look at the reference sheet all the time. Still, I find that some abilities are very weak while others are very powerful.

Then there is the action selection. I don't really like action selection but the fact that the actions on your first turn is going to be the same than your actions on your second turn makes it a bit annoying, but there is some degree of realism. If you focus on something, you must continue until the end for it to work.

For combat, since we played at 2 players, there was not really any competition for the combat tiles and the board space. Still, I found it a bit stupid that you would know the combat results in advance. I also found it stupid that some tiles are better than others. Nobody would pick them unless they are the only ones left.

In overall, there is really not a good feeling of actually running a civilization. Most of the time you seem to be struggling with your management of resources. Personally, I don't really see any interesting mechanics in this game either.

This Wallace game is very straightforward to play, but still takes a fair bit of time as you think through your options and do the accounting during the food, income, and VP stages.  I'm not sure how well this compares to Struggles although there is definitely some similarity.  Struggles stands apart for it's team/allies approach while this one stands apart/unique for the A/B turns where the B turn you may end up paying to take actions that you selected during your A turn.

Interesting combination of Empire Building and Area Influence.  I have played three-player  and five-player (2x). Three player may not have been ideal due to a general lack of tight competition and an endgame situation involving the alliance technology that led to a trailing player determing the game's outcome (although one could say that the winner earned the victory by grabbing the alliance at the right time),  Five-player was far better.

LONG. HEAVY. DIVERSE IN STRATEGIES.

If you can handle the 3 factors above then this is certainly for you.

It's really about choosing a path of terrain tiles + power tiles + some city tiles, while making sure to get a piece of the action on the main board; the latter of which is important to help garner timely resource markers and money and can also be a serious source of points.

The only negative is TIME. Our first game went four hours. I could see this getting down to 2.5-3 at best. I'm uncertain that it will see frequent play due this factor alone, but it certainly won't go untouched.

This game is grossly underrated.  It is a great civilization building game that can be completed in less than 3 hours.  The components are very nice and it is some very simple yet unique mechanics.  Every age is played in an A Age and a B Age.  In the A age you put your action markers on a track, in  the B age you have to pick up those markers an take the same action but it reverse.  It forces you to think two turns ahead.  It does have some limitations where some tiles are very much better than others.  I cannot see where some of them would be chosen unless all of them where bought and there was not much remaining.

Rise of Empires may be one of the best civilization-lite style games I've ever come across. Everything seems to make sense in some way so the abstraction level isn't that distracting from the overall theme. I got a great feel of civilizations struggling against and cohabiting with each other through time. Allies and deadly enemies are made throughout.

This one certainly looked good from reading the rules ... in actual play, however, it felt like a genetic throwback to the dark ages of boardgame design.

A multiplayer wargame that does not even consider kingmaking and who-whines-most-wins as problems to solve, but rather flaunts these faults might have rocked the house in 1985 and would still have been tolerable in the late 90s, but today it's just an embarrassment. Especially if you throw in some crucial, but only vaguely defined rules like resource limits.

Played once.

I have to say I wasn't sure about this one at first. It was the end of a long, stress-filled week at work and I just wasn't getting my head wrapped around the whole A turn - B turn (in reverse). Add a bunch of special progress tiles and multiple paths to victory and you got yourself a recipe for confusion. The fog doesn't last long, however. The gameplay is actually pretty straightforward, it just takes a bit to get up to speed. Unfortunately, this is one of those long evening games that would benefit from multiple plays in succession (Brass comes to mind), which is not always easy to do. This is a solid game. It feels like Advanced Endeavor to me. There is a lot of depth and variety in the decision making. Not sure if I need to own it, but I look forward to playing it again.

I will probably withhold judgment until I play this again.  While it shares some surface similarities to Struggle of Empires, it has a lot more in common with a civ game like Through the Ages, in my opinion.  Learning the game made it a bit on the long side, but it wasn't horrible...

Played this twice and liked it well enough, but never really had the urge to bring it back to the table.  It feels very abstract with no real theme, especially compared to the tight theme/mechanics coupling in Brass.

02/16/10 Played 2/3 of a five-player game. There were many choices to make each turn, but I didn't feel overwhelmed. The board is rather dull looking, much like Endeavor.  The action choosing mechanic is quite innovative. But some things, like the black resource disks, seemed just thrown in. The graphics/icons could be better. But I saw more good than bad. I look forward to playing it again. Tom Vasel says its a very good three player game. I hope to find out.     Oh, and much like my Age of Empires III board game, Rise of Empires has virtually nothing in common with its alleged computer game namesake inspiration. Why both publishers wasted the money to buy the rights to name these games such is beyond me. 
02/12/11 Played a (whole) game with three players. It took a lot longer than I anticipated (4 hours). But I liked it.

Update after playing it again, december 2010. Downgraded it. Still a good game, but for the time it takes, there are better options around. Good for sometimes, this game. 2/3 players has a dominant military strategy to win. With 4/5 players it is more balanced. 4 is optimal, with 5 it certainly takes too long.

This is another brilliant game by Martin Wallace. I love the mechanisms. Play is easy, but the choices are many. A brain burner trying to manage and optimize the different currencies: blocks, food, wares and money. The military strategy seems very strong, but managing food becomes a key issue then. You're vulnerable when players specifically attack you in your lands that offer foodbonuses.

This is a very, very good game. It would have made 10 if it weren't for the long playing time. With five players, a learning game took over five hours. That's almost an hour a turn. Twenty minutes per player to make a decision six times and take the appropriate actions. Downtime can be an issue, and AP can be something chronic with the wrong people. Still, this is an epic in every way. Pure, unadulterated genius.

Area control, civ-like.  I like it after 2 plays.  Lots of choices.  Need a few plays to get an idea of the depth and re-playability.  Heavy, long game.

Came to the conclusion that this wasn't going to see much play so I traded it in GenCon math trade.

It's pretty rare I don't buy a new Wallace game blindly. I didn't buy this one immediately thanks to a well written review by a geekbuddy who stated the game was disappointing. 

After playing the game once I don't feel disappointed, but not too WOW either. 

Negatives: Gameplay feels a bit fuzzy. We didn't get the feeling of having a bit of control on the game. Or game with 5 took 4,5 hours, which is just an hour too long for what it is. But maybe it was the newness of the game, or the slowness of play.

Positives: As with all Wallace's, there are various interesting strategies/tactics possible. The new "what you do in turn A, you have to do in turn B" mechanic is frustratingly nice.

We did enjoy our play. I guess I might buy this one eventually when found cheap.

UPDATE jan 2012: got it 2nd hand. Let's see how long it takes before it gets played...

Pretty good game.  It is rather abstract, but lots of tension over making your choices, which always seem too few.  The A/B part of a turn interesting, as what you choose in A effects what you may choose in B.  I hope more games do not use this, but in one game it is pretty interesting.  Super thick pieces.  Has some similarity to Struggle of Empires.  

9/17:  A second play.  It lasts a bit too long for its own good, and turn order a bit too critical, and leads to AP.  You need to know the tiles well, otherwise you make bad choices..

Played once.  This game is a beautiful action-choosing mechanic that is buried under a hideous mess of fiddleosity and analysis paralysis.  The action choosing mechanic is just brilliant: on each turn players get 6 actions; to choose an action they put a marker on one of five action tracks (each track gets you a different action).  Then, on the next turn players take their actions by _removing_ their markers from the action track.  So, when placing in round 1 you must take into account that in round 2 you'll also take that very same action (and can't take any actions that you didn't also take in the previous round).  That's just great.

The rest of the game is a mess.  The accounting is ridiculously fiddly: some resources are paid once when you get tiles, some resources are paid every turn (from a pool you have in front of you), some tiles incur costs every other turn, and some resources are paid every turn from a track on the board (that you simply track your increase or decrease in the value of).  And you can earn these resources on at least four distinctly different items, which go in different areas of the board.  The artwork on the pieces is not nearly as helpful as it could be in differentiating these three types of resources / payment timescales.

And, on top of collecting land, technology, and city tiles, players also have to control regions on the map with workers in a classical area-influence mechanic.  The action that allows players to place workers on the map combines placing meeples on the board with allowing fights (spending your own meeples to remove other meeples from the board); given the importance of the map, the many possible battles that can be done, and the many times players can change the map each turn, these actions take forever to carry out.  The game also seems a bit overly aggressive: it's easy to wipe out 4 or 7 other players' meeples in a single placement action, meaning that whoever goes first or second in a round might as well not place any meeples down.  

All in all, this is a long fiddle-fest that's not worth your time.  It took us four hours to play a five player game, and everyone at the table couldn't wait for it to end after the first two.

I wanted to like this one more than it turned out I did. It's not really a civ game - more a euro with civ elements. It's basically one of those games where you generate a resource engine which you then use to upconvert to some other resource or to vp, and bolted on top of all of that is an area control component. Still, for a resource management/area control euro, it is complex enough that it consistently defied my ability to predict and solve it. I'd call it a more complex version of Antike, and I won't say no to future games, but it's still nowhere near as interesting as Sid Meier's Civ.

An exemplar of "want to like" titles, Rise of Empires has ultimately failed. The game might be balanced for five players, but at that player count it takes forever and has considerable downtime during which there is little to consider. At lower player counts, the game gets successively imbalanced in favor of map domination, making tile selection an elementary process. I tried to adjust for this with some [thread=795200]variant rules[/thread], but the mindless "population bomb" strategy remains both strong and boring. If you want an area majority game (which this is), just play [boardgame=93][/boardgame]. If you want "civ lite" centered on tile selections to upgrade your civ, play [boardgame=92319][/boardgame] (or Goa, though that's a bit of a stretch). These other options will take only about 90 minutes, which is the absolute [i]minimum[/i] for this game, and even that's only for two players. Finally, if you've got the time for an epic area majority game that includes ways to "upgrade" your stuff, [boardgame=62219][/boardgame] has this one beat up and down.

RATING: 5
Over three epochs, guide your people to victory through a combination of technology, area control and building. Being a Martin Wallace game, there are the requisite tiles that give you special abilities, and the requisite elimination of cubes in the area control part of the map. There are a couple of neat mechanisms where you pick actions in reverse order in the "B" phase of an era, and he has eliminated the dice.

However, the game relies on people to be very experienced, since kingmaking happened in our first game.  Our first game with 3 players took 3 1/2 hrs. I was engaged the whole time, but I hated being picked on even when I was not leading anymore. There are some neat mechanisms, and I am willing to give this game another chance. However, my initial impressions are the system is okay, being able to smack anyone, anywhere, anytime is not my type of game. It felt like any decisions that I made were negated by being pounded.

Martin Wallace fans will enjoy this one.

Good civilization game. Good, but not great IMHO. The main thing I don't like is that it seems to be more tactical then strategical, because the situation (especially on the board) changes too fast. 

Too much advantage for the attacker, especially for the last attacker in move order.

My rating takes into consideration that the game is quite long. Consequently, if I have to spend a lot of times on this game, there are other games with similar length, but with more strategical depth that I prefer much more to play.

But still worth to play, because there is a lot of good "tension" and it is nice to play.

Not as complicated as most Wallace games. There are several paths to victory as usual. In our first game, I had tons of resources, Dan was collecting people and Rodger had a strong gold lead. Overall, the game was close, since there are several areas to play into, but you just can't get everywhere. You really need to concentrate one something, but with three, it's easy to let someone get away from the rest. Blocking is dangerous, since you need to use your limited moves to do it.

After the second game, we were discussing how the early rounds seemed almost extraneous. The points that you're collecting late game are so much more than the early game points, that it makes the early rounds almost meaningless. Hoarding resources for late game is a good idea, since you can get the bigger buildings and better trade deals. For a game that takes 3+ hours, it feels like it really comes down to what happens in just the last round. Makes me feel like maybe some kind of quick start setup might be in order.

First impression (4 players, 2/3 of a game): I really like the tension this A/B action selection system brings. You select what types of actions you do in phase A and then do the same actions (usually) in different order in phase B. Other than this there is couple of ways to score points, some of them coming from area control you have on map, others you buy with different resources/actions. Felt a good game and would like to try it again sometime.

RATING: 3
Broken rules (I am referring, for example, to this question http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/451411/new-world-far-east-question ). Come on, we are in 2009. It's no more the 80s when games needed houserules. When will Wallace produce a playtested and RULE-READ game? Is it so difficult to hire 50 gamers, have them read the entire rulebook alone to find out problematic sentences? Moreover, is it so difficult to draw a meaningful map (I am referring to Wallace answer http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/4178625#4178625 ) with proper boundary lines where they should be?

Apart from the rules' problems, the game seems to be an improved version of After The Flood. It inherits the same awful idea of "one piece of anything" and unfortunately it also inherits the concept of a totally chaotic map. You can develop your wonderful strategy on the map combined with the best strategy on progresses, but if another player with his bunch of cubes in hand decides that your regions are 1% better than the others... you can lose a lot of points just for his random decision. 
Yes, you can let players talk and discuss and therefore turning the game into a "whining and blackmail" game, where the winner will probably be the one who cries most or who picks 20 dollars from the wallet and gives them to the others not to attack him! But under these conditions I'd prefer to play Diplomacy or Small World which are explicitely focused on this aspect and do not annoy me with bookkeeping of food and resources.

Moreover, cities suck. They cost a lot, give you few points, and are good only to try to build the wonder the next turn.

Finally, players do the SAME actions. At the beginning everybody rushing for progresses and territories trying to be last in the empire action, and at the end everybody rushing for empire actions.

Is there something I would save in this game? 
Yes, the turn A and B mechanic is original and it works by itself (it does not work in combination with the actions whose choice is too straightforward). And I would save the food track, at least I do not have to manually count any fish counters.

It is not enough to be called Wallace to produce a good game!

Only had 1 very hitty 5 player game which felt like it got too kingmakery too often, as you get quite a bit of freedom on who to wipe of the board in the battle actions and, with the multiple ways of earning VPs, it's not easy to discern who the actual leader is, so doing it on feel can generate iffy-ness. Other than that, it's got an interesting feel about it. Turns are decently fast and come around often, and the A turn followed by the reverse-mirrored B turn in each of the three eras is a concept worth exploring (the 6 action types you take in the A turn will be done, more or less, in reverse order in the B turn). There's different engines to be built and tried, so reply is offered. Despite the lack of randomness, the hitty-ness made the end result seem too out of your control though.

Surprisingly the game is quite easy to explain, but as with many Martin Wallace games, the choices get more complex as the game progresses. You battle on the board for space, getting benefits and points for having the largest armies in an area and just points for being second. You use your tiles to get men, but they also have an upkeep at the end of each era (each two rounds) and also half your men, rounded up, are lost at the end of each era. One of the best new games at Essen, a must!

While nothing specific in the game is particularly objectionable, the game is just too long for the amount of enjoyment derived from it.  The symmetry of actions between the "A" phase and "B" phase felt clever at times, but at other times it was just frustrating.  Taking empire tiles seemed like a giant game of chicken, as it was obviously the best to be the last player taking such an action.  It didn't really have the feel of an empire-building or civilization game, it was really more about building a victory point engine under some pretty severe constraints--everything about the game just felt pretty difficult.

Slight upgrade: 8,5 - 9: This game have issues, its fiddly with all the tiles and all the endless counting of resources back and forth in the end of the game thurns. And pherhaps just a touch to abstracted for its own good too. But after several more plays I just realize how much I enjoy it.

***

Played with 4 as well. A bit long-ish, but very good. Run-away aspect actually seems weaker with 4. Perhaps still better with 3 with the less amount of down time.

***

Just two 2-player game + one 3-player game yet. Need at least one or two 4-player games before I learn the true nature of this game.

RISE OF EMPIRES is an odd bird, but for all it’s shortcomings, and maybe even because some of them, it is a very interesting game.

I’m not sure if the game is too unbalanced. Even if it plays very “euro” in it’s style compared to Wallace-standards, it is by no means one of these super-balanced, polite games where you get decent with VP’s just as you not are making stupid moves all the time.

One reviewer said that RoE “punishes certain styles of play and sub-optimum early actions”, and I find it to be very true. There may be a “run-away-problem”. On the other hand, with players familiar to RoE this should be less of a problem as the players can even out the odds them selves (i.e bash an early leader for one game turn or two).

There is some potential King-making, well a lot to be frank. But I don’t really mind that.

In two of my tree games there have been a huge difference in the end-score between players. Especially in the 3-player game.

But the game is FUN, and I am longing to play it again, and that really what matters in the end.

A tweaked version of Struggle of Empires. There are some things I enjoy more in RoE versus SoE. For some reason the game is more fluid which I like but does not seem quite as deep. Maybe as I have more experience with the game it will surpass SoE as there is certainly depth here. One of the best.

Wallace's take on the Civ theme.

Worker placement, area control, tech tiles, light combat rules, timing your expansion. It plays through 3 eras, but the tech "inconsistence" that is so prevalent in other civ games is absent here.

RATING: 7
The neat thing about RoE is the action mechanic. Each turn has an A phase and a B phase. During the A phase you can take whatever actions you'd like. You leave disks on the spaces of the actions that you choose . After each player has taken their actions in the A phase, the B phase requires players to remove their disks and take the action associated with it. If your disk is not at the end of the row (if you didn't place your disk last), you have to pay a coin for each disk that was placed after yours. What this means is that you are penalized in the second half of the turn for being early in the first part of the turn.

But the most important part of the game was the area control and I am not someone who enjoys area control. One of the players was incredibly clueless--a complete novice gamer--and there were many times during the game that I played suboptimally because I felt bad destroying the player who was thirty points behind me and making incredibly stupid moves. I would rather lose a game than all out attack a weak player. It's just no fun. The tiles were nice, but they took forever to set up and then most of them weren't beneficial enough to be worthwhile. 

It was a weird game and I'd play again, but I'm not running out to purchase it. In fact, I'm guess that my rating will decrease the next time I play it.

RATING: N/A
Typical clever Wallace game.  I like the interplay between area control, resource collection and engine building.  It's not really a true 'Civ' game, rather an area control game with a Civ-building theme.  I already have games which give that Civ-building feel, so I am prepared to part with this one.

Opened and played once.  Some minor crumpling of one of the box corners.

RATING: 6
Rich in decisions and opportunities, with a good worker-placement mechanism and echoes of El Grande in the area-majority contest on the map. Played once with five players. The game ran way too long and suffered from too much downtime and player chaos. Not sure I'm willing to play again with five, but might try it with fewer. My rating might rise if the duration and chaos can be reduced. But so far I think this one's guilty of the oft-heard accusation that Wallace's games are too much like work.

RATING: 5
Suprisingly abstract Wallace design. Not as much nation identity and customization as in Struggle of Empires or Princess of the Renaissance, less thematic than Liberte, Byzantium, or After the Flood. 

This is a pretty straightforward action drafting/ area majority game. You're essentially building an abstract and crude economic engine, and pushing cubes around a fairly ugly map. And if you get behind early, you're going to be a spectator for three more hours. 

However, the A/B decline mechanism is clever, there's not much downtime, and the whole thing hangs together reasonably well. I'd play again, but I don't expect any great depths of strategy or memorable narratives.

Really nice game. Works better in 4 players then in 3.

What I like:
- area control and movement
- cities and resources are off board, so cannot be destroyed
- nice and easy tech development
- you can be ganged up upon, but still protect most of your VP income

What feels weird:
- using a couple of actions you can spread throughout the world. It can be prevented by other players, you need people for it, but it still feels a bit weird.
- Old world is not that important in later eras

RATING: 8
An easy to learn, but weighty civ building game by Mr. Wallace. A clever turn-order mechanic lies at the heart of Rise of Empires, and it's this very mechanic that allows for such a rich experience. Often, the toughest decision you'll make each turn is on the action selection track. 

There are multiple strategic path to victory, and each one requires careful civilization management, and a sharp eye on the other player's actions.

Components are very good, but the art is somewhat bland. Everything is extremely functional in typical Wallace fashion.

This is the game I'll be turning to for my civ building fix.

RATING: 7.3
--Nov2009-- Fascinating take on the worker placement model:  linked pairs of turns, where one takes the same set of actions in both ends of the pair.  That hook, by itself, is perhaps cool enough to justify the occasional play; but the game is intriguing, well balanced, subtle and very enjoyable:  I'll hope to get it to the table regularly.

A civilization game about having more victory points, using mostly an area control system, but with other ways to score.  It feels like [i]Struggle of Empires[/i] revisited to make it shorter, clearer and sharper.  Nevertheless, from now on and expecting more plays from both, I like better the original game, even when this one is another excelent title.  Probably the game lenght keeps this from getting a rating of 9, but this issue may be vanished with more experience.

A very elegant and easy to learn game.  It's on the light side for wargamers (and I do mean light), but the trade off is that you get to move through all of civilization in about 2 hours and change.

Good production values, the A--B mechanic is very ionteresting, and the elements of civ building and conflict interact well.

От цивилизации в игре мало что присутствует, хотя технологиям (тайлам Прогресса) много уделено внимания. Однако, эта игра 100% продукт Мартина Уоллеса. ОПять же приятно, что как всегда продукт оказался абсолютно самобытным. Что то есть от Сумеречной Империи, что-то от других его игр, однако прямых параллелей нет. В сравнении с другой его "цивилизацией" Темпус, здесь мы имеем полноценную комплексную игру, в отличии от того "цивилизационного" карлика. Из минусов: количество пересчета разнообразных очков в течении каждого из 6 ходов немного утомляет.

After really trying to fix After the Flood with a lot of houserules this game comes as fresh wind to restore Martin Wallice as a Civ lite game designer.

Sure the theme of building a civilization feels a little out of touch but this is a fun game non the less.

The only problem I have with the game is that the cities during Era A feels like they are  a little weak as you don't really have any actions to spend om them. We are trying to fix this with a simple house rule:

All Cites has the ability that lets you swap 1 food for 1 player cube.

More plays will determine if this game holds up

RATING: 9.5
I'm really loving this.  I've now played it a few times.  And while it is a long one, I feel constantly engaged throughout the entire effort.

There is a ton of stuff here that is lifted directly from other games (namely El Grande) along with mechanics that we have all seen hundreds of times (drafting, worker placement, engine building), but the whole thing fits together so nicely and in a new way that it feels like a fun comfortable play. Plus you aren't going to see many of those things in a game with this much conflict.  

That said the "B" side to every era is quite new and frankly, really rocks my world.  The way it plays out makes for some really thought provoking decisions.

I should point out that Wallace really brought worker placement into being with Way Out West and still doesn't get credit for it, so I think it is just quite satisfactory that he has reinvented his own wheel.

This could make it to a ten rating with more plays.

RATING: N/A
Only one play isn't enough to rate this game. First impression was that this could be a very good game, solid and some new mechanisms that really convinced me. I have some doubts about how to control your strategy when playing with 4 or 5 players.

Components are generaly above the average although I don't like the art on the board very much. It's not a very cruel game to players in general, because resources are available for everybody at some point. Of course that since I've only played it with 3 players maybe choices were easier because of the strong offer.

The civilisation feeling it's not that strong, at least for me. I found the theme very well implemented but didn't get the civ feeling. Maybe it's my fault I admit.

I really have to try this game again.

After playing a few times more, with 2 and 3 players, I still don't have the civ feeling. It's a good game and I have to play it with 4 players.

Played again. First buildings suck. I don't understand why should players buy them because they don't work at all. They cost cubes to keep and give 1 or 2 VP's. Plus, they also cost one action.

Food is an important issue at the end game but not at the beggining. In that sense this game works as a different civ. The secret of te game seems to be in the board and in the number of cubes players can get.

Some discoveries are pointless when comparing to others. Why should players invent something like TV that gives, at most, 6 VP's and costs 5 coins (almost 2 VP's at the end of the game) when they can get Lenine for about 7 to 10 points costing nothing?!

Still struggling with some issues of the game. I don't like to play it with 3 players and I'm afraid that I'm discovering a totally chaotic game, not only with 3 players but also with more. The way pressure arises from every part of the map makes king making a very plausible scenario. Still have to play it with 4 and 5 player to determine how much do I like or not of this game.

The bastard child of El Grande and Through the Ages. Not as elegant as the first or as fun as the second

Very disapointing far too much going on. Artwork not functional.The mirror turn system not very interesting, too many choices mnay of them a bit random.

Not very much interaction apart from the bashing at round end.

Will play a few times more though

The sweet spot of this game is 5 players - pop bomb does not work

After my first play, I was not sure I liked this game - it is a complex mixture of resource management and conflict.  After my second play, I love it!  I was able to anticipate and plan a much more, using different combinations of progress tiles, territories and cities.  I can see many possible ways to victory in the game - the sign of a good game.  And even though it is rather long (4 hours), you are always engaged and time goes quickly.  So try the game at least twice - the first is a learning game.

A classical euro, a resource management covered under a coat of a civilisation developement game. The game mechanics seem to be decent, but some tiles are probably not balanced (certain very weak technologies and strong territories). Also, the rules are rather not elegant: because of numerous "small rules" and exceptions, the game doesn't progress smoothly. 
I found the game very dry, the mechanics don't match the theme, but it's of course my personal impression.

This game combines several elements that completely wreck a game for me. A rich get richer symptom, a kingmaking issue and it is very uninspiratiuonal. Granted, it's a better Civ-building game than Tempus, but that wasn't too hard. Also, the rules are quite ambiguous and lack important info. All that wouldn't be quite as bad if only game time were reasonable for what you get. But unfortunately it isn't.

One of my favorite games ever created is Struggle of Empires, created by the same designer, Martin Wallace. Wallace is currently my favorite designer. Rise of Empires plays out like a Struggle of Empires designed for a smaller number of players. Which is a good thing because Struggle of Empires is really at its best with 5+ players. RoE implements a lot of similar mechanics, but it's a different enough game to justify having both in your collection.

The most interesting element to me was the action selection/resolution mechanic. Players place their action tokens to take their turns in the first era, then they remove them in revers order (I'm simplifying a bit here) to resolve them again. So you have to think about what you want to do during the second phase as well as what you're doing in the first. The game is interesting enough in that part alone.

I still prefer SoE over this one, but the challenge with SoE is that you must have a higher number of players. If I thought I had a group that would play this often, I would probably pick it up. Alas, the group I will most commonly play with already has a copy. So I'll hold off for now.

It is a very good game but it takes too much time to calculate food, income, resources at the end of each turn. It has some innovative mechanics, it is well put together, and there is no much downtime (except at the end of each turn). It could have been an excellent game if there was a faster way to go through income, food, resources, cubes, victory points at the end of each turn. Components are very good.

Update 2014: I've moved away from complexity for the games sake in Euro games. There are much better ways to get down with this sort of dynamic, so this game feels like a quagmire .

*

Civ's are differentiated with tile pulls that define special abilities, actions, or resources. VP opportunities are also part of this tile mix, and an uncomplicated resource management layer that frames the game well & can be levered. Play feels balanced among these choices.

The 'reverse turn' mechanic is unique, you're taking actions that will be performed again in reverse (grab a calendar - it provides an interesting tactical edge in the reverse trip through the actions). Planning far enough ahead to leverage this return 'trip' is exquisite; bombing it can hurt.

Another nice touch is the halving of everyone's population at the end of each era - keeping most the established area control intact while also tightening the ratio's so every area remains competitive & there is a rise & fall to chase.

There's alliances & incentives to play with, neither of which I exploited well in my one play. So how robust this is I don't know.

Some decent stuff here, but the game is MUCH too long for what it is - it is fairly shallow, and at 3 hours or so I want something with more depth and/or more flavor (Rise of Empires is very abstract).

If the game were significantly shorter I would still have some issues with the design - I don't care much for the way the board play works, for example - but it would be worth playing.

The graphics are not helping, I should note. The board, while extremely drab, presents information reasonably well. However, the tiles are awful - muddy colors which obscure the important information, icons on the smaller tiles which are often unclear and are crowded out by pictures anyway, and massive inconsistencies (there's no way to tell a one-time cost from an ongoing cost from the graphic design).

Gang,

I played this for the first time yesterday.  It's an interesting game that requires a lot of decision-making and thoughtfulness.  However, it has a few flaws.  For one thing, the tiles that you select during the game are stacked in several different piles, and after each turn, the excess have to be removed.  Given how many tiles are in each stack, it's very easy for the piles to slide and spill over.  This game should be re-designed with cards instead of tiles.

Some of the technology tiles are quite interesting and by playing the game multiple times, certain technologies will be found to be far more advantageous than others.  Also, if there's a technology that provides instant victory points, then you should ALWAYS decide to select that one, if available.  I won the game we played, but by only one point, so if I hadn't chosen one of those critical tiles at any point in the game, the outcome could have been different.

Another drawback is that the game can be quite long.  It took us at least two hours to play with three people.  I suspect that it would have been even longer with more.

Seems like it should be good.  Then it isn't.  This seems to be due to a lot of things being not quite good, but no one thing being truly bad.  The art is pretty... but many of the numbers are difficult to read, particularly across the table.  There are multiple ways to compete in the game... but putting guys on the map seems to clearly be the best option.  There are a lot of currencies... but very little way to distinguish them in gameplay.  Civ-building and imperial expansion theme is appealing... but the implementation is exceedingly generic.  In sum, the game suffers the death of a thousand cuts.  There are better civ-builders than this one in the same amount of time.  Try [gameid=3931].

Interesante y entretenido juego con algunas reglas poco o nada elegantes (típico de Wallace) y un horroroso diseño para las losetas. Tengo la impresión que mejorará en futuras partidas...

Rise of Empires isn't a bad game. Unfortunately, there are already so many similar, better games that I can't see a reason to play this one. 

The standout mechanic here is the A-B-A-B-A-B turn sequence, where you must take the same actions in phase B that you chose in phase A, in (more or less) the opposite order. But it really isn't as compelling in practice as it might seem in theory.

Perhaps my biggest issue is that the game lacks a narrative arc- you are basically doing the exact same things in each of the game's three eras. Thus the game has none of that epic feeling that makes a classic like Struggle of Empires so immersive. It is basically JASE, and there are plenty of other 3hr soulless euros with more interesting game play.

This is a Martin Wallace game, so one should expect to find some of the same things in this game that one would find in any other of his games.  It has a small number of turns, but a lot of different things to consider, so the game will run longer than most games.  Like some other Wallace games, this one has a lot of tiles and things to break the normal flow of the turns, and since not all tiles are known ahead of time, familiarity with the tiles is almost a necessity, so that players aren't acquiring tiles that won't be as useful as something coming up on a future turn.  This is another area control game that isn't just an area control game, but ignoring that part of the game isn't a good idea, either.  It's definitely a game that requires multiple playings to truly judge, but it's off to a good start.

It a deception.
Poor development of the game. 
The designer never has played the game in its final version ! 
The game played in the 2-player version is broken.

A light version of Struggle of Empires. I think this one is more approachable than the former though the theme suffers somewhat because of greater simplicity. Still, this one is still low on luck and high on game play. And, as a fan of all-thing-Wallace I give it an extra 3/10ths bump.  I've read the reviews covering both favorable and problamatic issues with the game.  At heart, this is a game about map dominace and area control.  The Civ theme is pasted on with ways to provide avenues to gain the meeples you'll need for the land grabs.  I don't have a problem with that and feel this is an excellent Euro from Martin Wallace that falls on the light side of a gamer's game.

I liked it, but yet was disappointed by it.  It is, in my opinion, the least streamlined of Martin Wallace's recent games.  It is a bit fiddly, has a ton of choices, and overstays its welcome a bit.  

This game might have been better by being a bit "less."

RATING: 5.5
Provisional rating after a 3 players game interrupted during Era3 turn A because the place was closing.
Moreover, we missed the rule of discarding half of the cubes from the area after each era. Therefore we ended up with a severe Runaway Leader.

The game is cumbersome to be laid out, next time (if ever)  would place tiles one turn at a time.

It seemed too long and boring but with some interesting mechanics. The rules (my fault) weren't too clear and honestly they are too complicated, with small things to remember such as "during Era II turn A you could go to the americas but only if someone already took that tile..."

Maybe next time it will be better but i think there won't be such a thing as a next time.

Empire building Euro over three eras on a collaged world map of the Americas and Mediterranean regions.  Deterministic combat. Two-phase action selection system creates interesting long term strategy considerations.

Did this completely bomb?  I wonder.

Aside from my one play, I've never seen this hit the table anywhere. Not at conventions, game club meet-ups, my weekly gaming group, or anyone's house. Nothing.

[i]Update[/i]:

Played again, regretfully. Rating lowered.

It's too long, the religion/ideology tiles are overpowered, the island/ship strategy is suspiciously effective, it's too easy to bash the leader with battle actions, the map doesn't scale with the number of players (it should get bigger/smaller), the rules are a cavalcade of imprecision, new players are overwhelmed with options (hello, paralysis), and my mother doesn't love me as much as she used to.

In case you skipped to the bottom to get to the good part, IT'S WAY TOO LONG and I'M IN FAMILY THERAPY.

Like many Wallace games, you have several options each turn and you have to balance short and long term goals.

Elegant mechanics. Lively play. Very tough decisions. Loads of possibilities. As much going on as Through the Ages. Highly recommended for gamers who love medium heavy, meaty, games. An excellent game. Better to play with seasoned gamers. Newbies who don't like longish games will not be pleased to play this one.

Not sure about this one.  Wallace seems to work on coming up with an "odd" mechanic and then working to make the theme fit it.  When Feld does this, it works for me.  For some reason, when Wallace does it, it leaves me colder.

By way of explanation, the "odd" mechanic is a variation on action allocation.  In odd numbered rounds, you select actions.  In even numbered rounds, you are forced to perform the same types of actions you performed in the odd round selection, but not necessarily in the same order.

although mechanically it is a good game I felt the theme was very pasted on. Really didnt care for what each improvement represented unlike, for example, in through the ages. It felt more of a knizia design than a MW one

You need to play this game with people that are not afraid of conflict. You cannot play defense in the game, because there isn`t any. The main downfall with Rise of Empires is that the game seems weighted toward a single victory strategy (holding as much territory as possible). Other than that, and its long playtime (3-4 hours is standard), it`s a great game.

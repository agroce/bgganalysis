My rating is no longer tentative.

There is enormous potential in this design, but there are enough holes to flood all of Holland if your opponent wants to win with cheap, gamey tricks. The OB is beautifully done. The maps are clear and functional. The scenarios varied and interesting (once you get past the hatchet job done on the setups).

Here are some concerns:

1) In order to make Operation Market Garden "compatible" with the SCS system, I wonder how many historical sacrifices were made. I do not like reading about alternative strategies that involve 1st Airborne ignoring, or virtually ignoring, Arnhem until XXX Corps arrives. Where is the historical fun in that?  But I guess if I did not read this kind of "stuff," then I would not know, and ignorance would truly be bliss.

2) The charts provided are not up to the tasks needed to play this behemoth. Thanks to all those with the skills and software to step in and help. MMP is not alone among this game companies who do not provide the necessary charts.

3) The setup time is gicanourmous. Because the designer does not like them, no hex placements or reinforcement turns are printed on the counters. Hey, Dean! Unless you are going to get off your duff and come to my house and set up the counters, how about setting your preferences aside in order to help those of us who spend money on your games?!

4) There are a host of historical quirks and quarks that make this the SCS version of Paths of Glory.  You won't be playing INS to see how well it reflects history, but how effectively it distorts it. 

5) The designer's "kiss my feet" attitude went stale some time back.  This game is evidence that Dean can still sell designs, but that he lacks the willingness to foresee the problems, and to properly address them.   

Somewhere, in this box, there is a great game.  And all those folks who add their own house-rules on CSW seem to agree.

Excellent monster sized game with very playable rules. Each scenario that I tried played like a full game and while I dio not have the space now, I see that the full campaign would be very manageable given the fairly easy rules.

Finding units for scenario set up is a bit tedious but that can be remedied with a couple counter trays using more sorting of units moreso than just by color.

This rating is after one session of play that went 12 turns. If you're a fan of SCS games, add two to this rating. If you're a fan of monster games, add two to this rating. (Yes, if you're a fan of both, this game goes to 11!)

This game really needs at least 5 players around it if you want to finish it in a weekend of play. Preferably 7 or so. All the better if they are already experienced SCS players. (The roles might be, roughly: XXX Corps., 1st Airborne, 82nd Airborne, 101st Airborne, Germans north of the Neder Reijn (Arnhem area) or perhaps the Waal, Germans east of the XXX Corps. route. Germans west of the XXX Corps route. Some role adjustments can be made as the game progresses.)

Expect turns to be as quick as an 45 min.-1 hour for both sides together with experienced SCS players, upwards of two hours per turn or more with inexperienced or new-ish SCS players. The opening turns and reinforcement-heavy turns will be particularly long. Have plenty of reference charts, combat tables, and dice-rolling areas handy for players.

Personally, I had a great time with the game, chiefly because I was in the company of experienced SCS players who are great guys to game with. The game itself is also very good, but I hesitate to go to great since I'm neither an SCS die-hard, (though I have played several different titles) nor a great fan of monster games—even less so after the 12-hour mark at the table.

I expect that I'll play this again, since the SCS is one that can be mastered fairly easily—though don't go too long between plays—and the subject is a siren for WWII wargamers generally. And given that every player will handle at least a divisions worth of counters in company-level elements, there are no small or unimportant roles to play if you can simply get yourself to the table. 

With the benefit of experience to guide me, here are some things I think groups should do if they decide to tame this beast:

1. Each side should do a 'map recon' of the board. 

If this is done at the gaming site, each side should have time at the table alone to discuss the primary objectives, the rivers and their crossing points, terrain generally, the route for XXX Corps' advance, details of the drop-zones, and the reinforcement schedule—even if you're a big fan of the campaign itself. Some of this can be discussed with everyone at the table, but each side should have 30 min.–to an hour alone to familiarize themselves with the map and their roles in the campaign.

If this is done away from the gaming site, each side can meet informally for as long as they like to go over someone else's copy of the game and map or with a number of printouts. 

2. Our host had _everything_ ready to put on the table as soon as we showed up to play. The reinforcement schedules had units on them, ready to go. The DZ's were marked and all landing units ready to be scattered on the map. If you're still punching counters on game day, you're doing it wrong.

3. Break the game up into managable stretches beforehand. I'd suggest breaking up the game into blocs of three or four turns at a time and then taking a snack/meal break away from the table. This sets points for individuals to leave or enter the game, assume a new role, or adjourn until the next session. It helps people to manage their time so they can plan for contingencies, duties, or other appointments. Our group generally followed this plan. 

As for the game, it felt at times like playing the SCS titles 'Bastogne,' 'Yom Kippur,' and 'Stalingrad Pocket' all at once. And given the size of the maps and the number of counters involved, I think that's no great exaggeration. It still has all the things that SCS fans  players like that I'm not convinced of: generous road movement, exploitations and overruns, and the assurance that every unit can navigate the road net unerringly and cross bogs and ditches unfailingly. 

I realize that these are absractions to make the big operations that the SCS system covers stay managable and playable, but they still grate somewhat. Again, it's a personal peeve. 

For SCS and monster game fans, you're going to have a great time with this game!

Un très bon jeu, idéal sur un week end. Il est étonnant qu'un jeu si vaste et avec autant de pions soit envisageable sur deux jours avec 2x2 joueurs. La situation est très agréable avec un début de campagne avec presque aucun pion sur les 5 cartes du jeu. Les situations stratégiques sont vastes et variées assurant une grande rejouabilité.
Le système tourne parfaitement. Il faut bien maîtriser les franchissements des rivières ou fleuves pour ne pas faire d'erreurs. Les règles de "marche sur route" sont à assimiler avec soin afin de ne pas se faire surprendre. Celles sur le ravitaillement sont également primordiales.
Le jeu n'obtient pas le 10 sur 10 qu'il mérite en raison de la possibilité de faire poser planeurs et parachutistes en ville dans les placements libres du scénario 1 avec une seule chance sur trois d'avoir des pertes...C'est un peu trop facile de s'emparer d'Arnhem et de Nimègue ainsi...
Néanmoins, c'est un jeu qui procure beaucoup de plaisir!

RATING: 8
Excellent, simple game for two teams of three people each. Great fun, paranoia and roleplaying elements when playing isolated para units literally a yard or so away from each other. 

The only downsides concern the 30 corps advancement: one, it is dependent on not having bad luck when clearing out a single German step stuck in a city supply road hex and two, moving a hundred or so 30 corps units can becomes pretty boring when there is little or no opposition and only stacking, map entry and road move rules are holding you back.

The first game i've played as a multi map monster. I got my lungs handed to me by the SS panzer devision. My paras never made it to Arnhem and spent the game defending their drop zones. 30 Corps had some success but never quite got there. A game really comes alive when its not a random chart result or scenario condition that your holding out for, but a real person 4m down the table.

RATING: 5
Poor: Grand Tactical/operational - WWII - Easy

Plus:
-Market Garden provides the perfect narrative for a wargame
-Very accessible system, unbelievable how few rules this game has simulating a very complicated battle.
-Scale is perfect: not too small, not too big; 5 maps seems huge but the game provides enough detail that a market garden game requires; this battle was fought between batallions squattered around a large area. Some games try to compress everything on 1 or 2 maps in order to provide a manageble game but backdraw is that you lose important detail on pivotal battles at Arnhem, Nijmegen, Grave, son, Veghel etc. 
It Never Snows provides an insight in all the important hotspots on realistic scale.

Minus:
-Rulesset is so thin, I suspect it to cause oddities. Certain situations has to be dealt with with certain rules but there is no chrome whatsoever in this game. I read some comments on the ease of the Germans to cross rivers too easy. 
-Not good history if you know how to (ab)use some rules to your advantage. CSW provides alternative rules to prevent this. Have yet to try.
-Huge game when playing the campaign.

Revisited but ease of play is unfortunately also it's handicap. Sold it.

RATING: 9
Fantastic game. We started at the beginning of the campaign game - all five maps of 10 feet of "A Bridge Too Far". Simple, yet enough complexity to keep us hardcores fully engaged. No front lines and chaotic. A new version of the "big, dumb monster wargames from the times of yore". Highly recommended.

While it lacks beautiful chrome (leaders!, reaction movement, die modifiers to the combat, etc), there's enough "beef" here. Graphics are ok. No counter art,but, this is just a game for bashing. One of those few games to appeal to new recruits to the hobby and those of us with a bunch of hair on our arse.

Best compliments I can give this game is that a number of people stopped by while we were playing:

A hardcore wargamer: "Why am I working and NOT playing this game?"

A young potential recruit: "I had no idea games like these existed. It looks MUCH cooler than the games I know. WOW. What are these things and where do I get them and play them?"

So, get this one. And, play it at your local game store; it's a good recruitment tool. Hats off to MMP and Mr. Essig. And, now we need this similar treatment for da bulge.

RATING: 6
It was a fun game but as a simulation you have to overlook so many weird things happening. The SCS system and this scenario lead to a lot of gamey tactics that break the simulation and even the game if you think about them too much. The supply rules actually do break the game and force the Allied player to "gamey" movements of the paratroopers.

When a paratroop unit is approached by any XXX corps unit, and it's not too clear that the assigned armoured units to the paratroopers are XXX corps or not (different players had different interpretations on that), the WHOLE paratroop division for the next turn then has to draw supply the same way XXX corps does. What happens in game terms is that a XXX corps unit will approach a lone paratroop unit which is guarding a crossroad (an they HAVE to with the SCS high-speed train like road movement rules) and suddenly the whole paratroop division which could be a half map or more away is now out of supply. Next German player turn the German player can now attack the whole paratroop division at half defense since there's no way the majority of it will be in supply (think of the 82nd surrounded in Nijmegan way up the map from the XXX corps as an example).

The Allied player is now forced to have their paratroop units RUN away from XXX corps to prevent this situation from happening. Well, this certainly is realistic.....

The problem I have with the designers/publishers is the cavalier attitude they have to this rule and their ignoring of its effects on the game. They have simply stated for players to interpret the rule however the players think logical, well as it's in the German players interest to follow the rule to its exact wording they will want the Paratroopers out of supply asap. Yet on the other hand the designers/publishers state that other rules are to be interpreted EXACTLY as written. Why the two different ways to read the rules? Why don't they just admit they messed up and fix the supply rule? How about have the rule kick in when the Div supply drop zone is in range of XXX corps? While they are at it, clearly state that the assigned to paratroop armoured units are or are not part of XXX corps.

So to sum up this rant, before playing make sure that you and your opponent(s) agree on how to work the supply rules in regards to the paratroopers and their relationship to XXX corps AND if the para attached armoured units are to be considered part of XXX corps or not. You will then have a trouble free game.

Oh, and referring to my "high-speed train" movement comment, SCS road rules and what happens in the game (lots of shunting units to side roads to let the express units through) could be used as the inspiration for a rail game.

It's ridiculous that all roads are treated the same and there is no combat penalty for units in column road movement.

What about tanks? They are no different than infantry other than faster movement and lower defense values. The paratroopers must each have about a dozen bazookas strapped to themselves jumping into battle. No real feeling at all in this game for the difference of armoured units to infantry and at this scale that should be significant.

The SCS rules really need a major revision, they feel like they are from 1974 and not in a good way.

Another strange thing, no extra penalty for landing gliders in a city... OK, I'd better stop thinking too hard about this game now or I'll ruin the fun.

Typical Standard Combat Series game from MMP except that it uses 5 maps for the campaign scenarios.  As always with he SCS games the rules are very close to the classical "norm".  Only the airdrops and full-movement-factor exploitation (seen in all? SCS games) aren't standard fare.  Fun and easy, a Market Garden game for those times when life is wearing you a bit ragged.

I've played both this and MMP's other "monster" Market Garden game (actually only the Where Eagles Dare half of the two-game set) and find I prefer the Standard Combat Series version.  The hex scale is coarse enough in It Never Snows that only artillery gets ranged fire while in Where Eagles Dare (of the Grand Tactical Series) the scale is such that every unit does.  The difference is enough that It Never Snows feels almost operational while Where Eagles Dare is definitely tactical.  Despite the quasi-operational feel, It Never Snows works well on its company scale.  Good game, and with only 2 counter sheets it's a "monster" that plays in a weekend.

I also tried the 2-map scenario that's been posted on the web.  It showed the game system to good advantage, yielding historical results with a lot of nail biting.

It could be a much better game if victory conditions were attainable by the Allies. As they are, the Axis needs only to destroy 1st Airborne and fortify Nijmegen and Arnhem and it's impossible to defeat them. Victory should be based on a system of points based on performance. Other than that, counters and map are good and game system is correct. Game experience is good.

Now the SCS wasn't all Sierra Hotel to begin with, but why does Dean Essig have to ruin everything he makes by making it bigger and even longer to play.

Honestly, the SCS is supposed to be a simpler system that is generally highly playable. Then he goes and ruins it with games so big that one side might as well not bother showing up while the other side is moving.

I used to own LOTS of Gamers games ... excepting the ACW brigade series I think I owned every other game (about a decade back: OCS, NBS, TCS, SCS.) Played them all, too.

RATING: 9
Excellent, best Market garden game I've played. I really like the straightforward SCS system, this adds a few extra rules and plays very well. 
Very detailed OB (which means it takes a few hours to set up). Plays on a 9 foot by 4 foot table.  
March moves take a little getting used too, it's frighteningly easy for the Germans to smash into the side of the corridor.

I tweaked a few rules:
Pontoon bridges are treated like ferries the turn they are created, i.e. only four units may cross and they must stop in the first hex on the far side.
Opposed crossings: Pontoon bridges and ferries can only be built in an EZOC if they pass a die roll: to succeed pontoon bridges must role a 6, ferries a 3 to 6.
For artillery purposes units may spot enemy units on the far side of a river bank provided the two units are only separated by one "P" hex.
(Very optional). Allied aircraft need spotters to engage units inside the XXX Corp boundary. They may engage units north of the Wall provided they are spotted by non-British Airborne units, Once XX Corp reach the British Airborne the British Airborne may spot as per other units. (the allied tactical air force was forbidden to engage targets of opportunity due to some unfortunate misunderstandings in Normandy when they fired on allied troops.)      

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.8
Some major issues in the campaign game.  Most obviously, if the Germans blow up more than a couple of bridges, the game is over, as the Allies simply don't have any more bridging units.  Quite literally, this means you might as well just roll the D6 a few times to see if more than those couple bridges are blown because there's just no point in playing if they do (It becomes literally impossible for the Allies to win).

Supply rules are a bit goofy, as are strat moves.  With perfect information, both are able to wind their way on a lovely joyride up and down the map unlimited spaces, weaving around enemy troops with ease.   Road blocked?  No problem, just take this side road over to another side road and then back around that road block (and so on...).

The two northern-most drop sectors are pretty much doomed when playing against a competent German player.  The supply zones don't move, and so the Allied player must artificially protect these areas and this distracts from the main goal of capturing the respective town.

There's nothing tremendously wrong with this game, there's just not a lot of real wargaming here. So many "gamey" tactics are employed because if you don't your opponent certainly will.

Three scenarios and one campaign game played so far. Big game, simple mechanics, the campaign is meant to be played. Hopefully they will publish an "official" XXX Corps scenario for Map E. The Arnhem scenario (5.6) is a learner, not one for competitive play. Most excellent game.

RATING: 3
After four campaign plays, my rating reflects the fact that First historichal campaign is virtually unplayable for allies. Second some bad rules (ex. supply can be traced over prohibited terrain is quite funny in a wargame) make the game experience not so good.
Third the charts and tables that you can find here in BGG files are far better than the charts you can find in the game.
It is true a campaign is very quick to play but i prefer play one hundred times Devil's Cauldron or Where Eagles Dare scenario than another campaign of this. 

UPDATE rated 3 because the allies can win even not take the ahrnem bridge nor have a single 1st airborne unit in the game.
also you can bypass river and take the bridges after from behind (also with tanks and motorized units).

Stalingrad pocket (I or II) remains the best scs game so far.

Nearly a great game, but ignores several essential historical constraints.

SCS at his best. The size, density and nature of this particular campaign makes this one a fun game to play for both sides, from the very beginning to the very end. The victory rules are a bit ... well... better played without the victory conditions stated in the rules.

I like the simplicity of the rules yet complex situations presented of Standard Combat Series (SCS for short). Wargames are often complicated and need time to learn rules and understand the situation and having a system that allows to know the basic rules for all games with just some small additions of specific rules makes the life of everyone who want to explore the fascinating world of wargames much easier. 

It Never Snows presents great scenarios from the operation Market Garden and both small scenarios (Germans defending city of Nijmegen and it's bridges across the river Wall/Rhine) and the whole monster campaign are aproachable and exciting to play. This was the second game in the series I played afters Bastogne and I really like both.

I believe this is a game struggling for a reason to be.  It is the usual SCS fare in that it does have low rules overhead and is simple to grasp.  However, it's sheer size makes the game problematic - eliminating some of its "soul" instead becoming a becoming a bit of a chore to push counters around.

Set up as the Germans is particularly annoying (a problem in general with all SCS)

This is not to say it is a bad game perse - if you can play the whole thing.  Just that I believe there are better treatments of the battle.

It is trully a beareable monster. 

The light counter density makes it easy to manage. 

It is true that there are some historical inaccuracies but it is definitively very funny.

Love the SCS or as I refer to it, the "Simple Combat System".  A very "solo-able" system.  Not sure if I'll ever get a full campaign game on the table, but there's enough smaller scenarios in this monster to keep you satisfied for years on end.

Mixed feelings on this one.  I liked the easy rules, fast playing, little time spent referencing rules, grand scale, and the big push in the campaign scenario.

However, the supply rules are brutal for the airborne units and they can quickly become useless if they go out of supply and no longer can attack at all to try to reestablish supply.  The road march rules seem unrealistic and gamey as the Allies can quickly move through Hell's Highway once cleared.  With all the road connections, it is hard to block supply or prevent units rapidly moving with road march.  On the other hand, a single weak German unit can move all over the map and cut off the Allies entire supply or hold up the entire convoy.  There are many types of units, but all of them play the same other than their strength regardless of whether they are training infantry, anti-tank units, or panzers.  A bit more chrome would have allowed you to take advantage of the various types of units rather than simply have them get lost as generic ones.

**NOTE** Seems "Rod Johnson" likes to give almost every game on BGG a 1 rating. I doubt Rod has played INS, since it isn't out yet. He is also not listed as a playtester. **/NOTE**

I've been playtesting since HomerCon and watching this game transform with each rule update is simply amazing. (Disclaimer) SCS is my favorite series to game and Dean Essig is my favorite designer.

This game packs in a LOT of goodness. The campaign is massive, but very playable and has a great feel to it. I've enjoyed it thoroughly. Just recently got access to the smaller scenario's and in typical Dean fashion, there are a bundle of goodies to be had. So if you feel that this game is "too big" for you, think again. This game has everything you could want... a giant campaign (that plays quickly) and many smaller scenario's that fit on 1 or 2 maps (looks to be at least 4 1-2 mapper scenario's covering different situations at the bridges/major supply roads). What more could you ask for in one box? If you lack the space for the campaign, you can just play the scenarios, which will be like a full SCS game anyway.

In short, this game is turning out to be a real gem. When this thing finally goes up for pre-order... definitely BUY IT! My score of 10 stands for now, as our group has had a lot of fun playtesting it and it only seems to get better with each version revision. This is one you will not want to miss, as there is a lot of goodness to be had. Yes, I am an SCS fan boy. :)

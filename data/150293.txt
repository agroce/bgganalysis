The Ravens of Thri Sahashri is a game of very subtle strategies. My wife and I found it fascinating and fun. Those who enjoy co-operative or puzzle-like games should pick this one up. The asymmetrical aspect sets it apart from most other co-op games, as well. The theme and art are beautiful and mysterious. Bravo to Kuro for giving us such a unique, challenging experience.

I like the idea, I like the art, and I still have no idea what really went on.  But I like the game.

This is a game where the rulebook struggles to explain the complexity and nuances of the rules, but it's a great puzzle that I enjoy working on, especially with the interaction and predictions between the two players.

I picked this up because it seemed so different from other games and because the backstory / theme was highly compelling.

Unfortunately, I wouldn't say that either of these comes through in a particularly great manner.

I love the asymmetric play in something like Android: Netrunner, because it adds depth to the game and theme. But Ravens is not actually an asymmetric game. It's a deduction game that, in effect, uses a second player to peak at a face down card and say "Yup" or "Nope". Technically, that player has some extra abilities, but the game still feels 90% like a solo game that just happens to use a second person to deal with the problem of hidden information.

Whereas, the main player is going to be head down, running numbers, rearranging cards in his head, looking over the available special powers, etc. It's a full and interesting solitaire game. Not a terribly thematic one - it feels like juggling multiple tasks more than it feels like an attempt to ferret out Ren's lurking psychological issues - but certainly an engaging one.

So as a two-player game, Ravens only recommends itself to a couple where you have one hard-core gamer who is forceful enough to make his partner sit there, bored, peaking under cards so that he can play a hard-core solitaire game. I worry about the home life of the designer of this game.

This isn't to say that an asymmetric game with different difficulties is bad. You might be playing with a kid or someone who enjoys gaming more than they are particularly good at it, but I doubt that most children would be sufficiently entertained playing as the Ren character, and I feel like you would do better to find a different co-op that still allows your partner to do something than play Ravens. If your partner isn't terribly good, then just tune the difficulty to something appropriate for you two. There's no need to find a game that makes their participation largely irrelevant.

While short, the rules are very convoluted. You'll probably need to re-read them in full 2-3 times before you will be able to play, and still reference them again during play. It is not a game for the casual player, unless you are playing as Ren of course. But it's not clear, to me, that this complexity really serves much purpose. In terms of providing an overwhelming quantity of stuff to keep in mind, Glass Road or Merkator both offer that, yet have a very streamlined and smooth set of rules, while also offering solitaire play or a *genuine* two player game. So I would recommend those if you're looking for something heavy to play solitaire.

If you want a good co-op with tune-able difficulty, a small package, and theme, then I might suggest looking at the Oniverse games. I haven't played it, but Sylvion looks to be the most complex, if that's what you're angling for.

RATING: 7
It is in the nature of fully cooperative games that they present a problem that must be solved and are thus fairly puzzle-ish.  I don’t enjoy puzzles very much.  To me, the success of a fully cooperative game depends on the depth of thematic gloss concealing that puzzle-ish nature. 

Ravens is a number puzzle.  The aim of the game is for one player to complete three sets of cards whose values total seven and one set whose value totals five, and to do that three times over.  This task is aided by the other player overlapping cards of the same suit in a puzzle-ish fashion to form sets of value seven.  Making the task more difficult are thieving raven cards that diminish the deck round by round.     

However, I find the thematic gloss very appealing.  We represent two characters; one (Feth) is a psychic who is trying to assemble and repair the fragmented memories (represented by partially obscured images on the cards) of the other (Ren – his girlfriend in a coma).  I see the ravens as representing Ren’s inner demons.  Those sets of numbers she is assembling are the lines of a poem in a traditional form.  Cards she keeps concealed represent her deepest feelings.  

 As you will have gathered, the game play is quite asymmetric; Feth does most of the work, while Ren is mute and inactive for long stretches, as befits someone who is unconscious.  I don’t mind that, though it does bother other commenters.

I own the Osprey edition.  The artwork is nicely done and the cards are thick, though not of the best quality.  The rule book could have been clearer and more concise; it does rather ramble on.

Wow!  I'm not one for theme, but Ravens definitely drew me in.  

It's a 2-player asymmetric cooperative where players can only communicate their thoughts by the cards they play.  Imagine, no group strategizing, no alpha player.  All you can do is hope your partner figures out what you're thinking/hoping by your card choice.  

And the theme of one player trying to save the other just gave me chills.  Silly, I know, but I really liked it.  Definite keeper.

This is an experience. I play it with my wife mostly, and you have to use an incredible amount of non-verbal understanding of one another to be successful at this game. After winning for the first time, it was an awesome surprise to open the first envelope and realize that the game was made harder, which increases my desire to get it to the table again and again after winning.

RATING: 8
This is an EXCELLENT puzzle. There's so much to think about, so many interlocking pieces that twist your brain just right. And I love the legacy element, though it does present the game's only one true bummer:

It just doesn't feel as replayable as other co-op puzzles. It's addictive as hell until you open that third envelope (in our case, four games) and then it just feels like you've "beaten" it. Don't get me wrong - I will happily come back and play Ravens lots more, just because the puzzle is [i]so[/i] good, but the ultra-addictive quality fades as soon as that seal is broken. The randomization element just doesn't make for as strong game-to-game differences as in, say, Pandemic (or even Hanabi).

And on that note, without spoiling anything, I will say that we didn't care for one of the rules added (or rather, removed) later in the game. Yeah, it makes for the game's biggest challenge... but it also removes a huge point of interaction for one of the players and reduces player interaction overall. From now on, we'll be doing the hardest challenge every time we play... [i]except[/i] for that one bullet point. It simply gives one player much, much less to do.

Despite my quibbles, this is a fabulous game I would happily recommend to just about anyone.

Amazing 2p asymmetric co-op deduction microgame from Japan, with a unique theme and tricky, innovative mechanisms.

I think the game is better when the Ren player has a card holder so that she can see all her dream cards and not have to keep secretly looking at them.  Borrowing one from 10 Days in USA/Europe/etc. should do the trick.

A spacial and numerical cooperative puzzle game with a cute story about fighting memory-eating birds. Certainly very stylistic, and great all the way to the end.

Absolutely worth the price and the experience.

Ravens of Thri Sahashri is puzzle-oriented 2-player co-op with asymmetric roles. For a simple deck of cards, there are a lot of rules with this game, which will probably lead to a lot of rules questions. If you can power through them, get them straight, and find someone who's willing to delve into this game with you, there is good replay value here. The Osprey Game's edition, in particular, is a wonderful package. The cards are now Dixit-sized, I enjoy the graphic design of the cards more, and it has a greater sense of progression and story than it previously had. I've always liked the anime artwork in both editions and it's nice to see anime artwork being used that people do not consider lewd. One point of caution to mention would be that one of the roles has significantly less taxing decisions to make... that could be a positive or a negative depending on your preferences. At it's current cost, this is definitely worth checking out if anything of what I've said sounds interesting.

This is a strange little fascinating game. It's not complicated as such, but it has so many things going on at the same time and that makes the rules something that you have to work for to get right. It's a challenge, one that I look forward to every time we play it!

"Igår fik vi endelig taget hul på [b]The Ravens of Thri Sahashri[/b]. Der er tale om et asymmetrisk kooperativt kortspil, hvor spillerne påtager sig at spille et forelsket par, henholdsvis pigen Ren, der har nogle traumatiske oplevelser med sig i bagagen og nu ligger i koma og den unge mand Feth, der skal forsøge at dykke ned i Rens drømme for at vække hende op igen. Spillet lyder umiddelbart lidt kryptisk og vi måtte også starte forfra på et par prøvespil før reglerne efterhånden kom helt på plads. Da vi først blev grebet af det spillede vi så også fem spil i streg selvom spilletiden er sat til ca. 45 min. Og vi er kun lige begyndt! Grundmekanismen er, at man skal forsøge at kommunikere udelukkende gennem sine valg af kort. Af tre omgange skal man fremstille et japansk digt på formen dodoitsu 7-7-7-5. Det foregår på den måde, at der for hver strofe er et lukket kort som kun Ren kender værdien og farven af. Feth trækker så mange kort han vil fra en bunke; ikke for få, da han gerne vil kunne lægge kort i hver farve samlet med summen 7, men heller ikke for mange, da han ikke må løbe tør for kort og der hver gang kun kan tages et kort til digtet og han jo flere kort han trækker også løber risiko for at støde på ravne, der kan finde på at bortføre dele af drømmen. Feth placerer de trukne kort i en central konstellation kaldet Atman. Kortene der afbilleder Rens drømme er delt i fire kvadranter, hvor nogle kvadranter er overmalet som symbol på, at drømmene er udvisket. Der skal være overlap imellem mindst en udvisket drøm på de overlappende kort og typen udvisket eller klar skal matche alle steder der er overlap. Det er fra denne at Ren så må tage et kort og tilføje til den første ufuldendte strofe i digtet. De kort der tilføjes til digtet kan udover at de skal færdiggøre digtet også give Feth større mulighed for manipulation af kortene, de giver signaler om hvilke farver, der ikke skal være i Atman og de giver ledetråde til hvilken farve det skjulte kort i strofen har. Det er nemlig sådan, at når et digts fire strofer er fuldendt skal Atman indeholde kort der har samme farve som de skjulte kort i digtet - og alle farverne skal være repræsenteret. Jeg forestiller mig ikke, at man kan spille endsige forestille sig spillet på baggrund af denne beskrivelse, men måske få en fornemmelse af, at der er mange afvejninger undervejs. [b]The Ravens of Thri Sahashri[/b] er udpræget et spil, man kan have glæde af at spille med den samme person gentagne gange, så man efterhånden kan forfine de signaler der ligger i udvælgelsen af kort. Udvælgelsen af kort kan i første omgang virke en smule intimiderende, men der er meget mere logik og deduktion i spillet end f.eks. Hanabi, hvor det ofte bliver meta-spillet, der skal give signalerne. Det syntes jeg ikke er tilfældet i tilnærmelsesvis samme grad i [b]The Ravens of Thri Sahashri[/b], hvor man skal være meget mere stringent i tankegangen. Fantastisk interessant spil."

Asymmetrical, two-player only, cooperative card game like no others we've played before.  The rules, when you first read, are a little hard to understand but once you've played a turn or two they start to make sense.  Overall, it's a great little game that packs quite a punch.

Winning my first play of a co-op is very unsatisfying, because then I have no idea where the real tension is supposed to be and am not really motivated to play again. And then I can't even tell if I like the game.

Plenty of "aha" moments in seeing how the game systems fit together. Those insights just further diminish the theme's role in the game, though.

Wonderful 2 player game for a rainy day. I was worried that the player playing Ren would be board, since the detective is the one solving the major puzzle of laying out the memories. However the Ren player is very invested in their turn, and makes some of the most crucial decisions. They also had some story hidden away in envelopes giving the game a light legacy feeling.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Ravens of Thri Sahashri is an unbalanced two player cooperative game, with some of the limited communication of Hanabi, based on sequential tableau building, the Feth player building a card source for the Ren player, and both players battling against the Ravens.

It's a puzzle game- Ren cannot communicate directly with Feth, except by card plays, and Feth provides the source of cards to complete the 3 Poem tableaux, while battling the Ravens that will steal the memory cards Ren needs to win the game for both players.

I found it difficult to get one's head around at first, but it grows in ease as a pair of players continue at it.  Also, the gorgeous new version from Osprey includes a series of Legacy style envelopes that amp the difficulty as players continue to play, providing continued challenge with the game.

Though a couple of the Rules wordings are a bit unclear, the game is as appealing as the best manga can be, the play is challenging, and the parallel solitaire games are compelling.

It's a terrific reprint of an import, and one I'm very glad to have around.

An unusual cooperative game in which players take asymmetrical roles. Kind of like Mysterium for two. Not everyone will like both of the roles but I think that playing Ren is very fun and challenging and it reminds me of trying to communicate with card play like in Tichu and other partnership games. The one flaw of the game is that it can end suddenly due to ravens being flipped early

Whoa, what a game - a definite brainburner to me, although there is a small luck effect (especially in the third round, when you can calculate well which numbers are needed, but have little chance to find out the colors in time). 
My wife is not likely to play this with me again - she says it does remind her of Hanabi - so I will have to let it go, I'm afraid. But I am very glad to have had the experience of playing this thoroughly unusual and beautiful game. 

The German rules have not been proofread, unfortunately - tons of typos, anglicisms, missing verbs and what not. I was happy to have the English version which is better.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (March 2017)

I have heard good things about The Ravens of Thri Sahashri and after reading the rules, I thought the game was going to be great, however it ended up disappointing us.

Reading the rules wasn’t as easy as other games. I read a PDF I found here on BGG (from the 2013 edition), and it has some parts that were a bit confusing, for example, when talking about the end of the round and the matching colors from the Atman it doesn’t let absolutely clear that zero is a valid answer. Also, if you read BGG´s description of the game it says “Once all four hidden cards are completed, the round ends and unless the playing field has exactly the colors represented among the hidden cards, the players have failed.” and that’s NOT the case. When a round ends you can have some colors in your heart that aren’t in the Atman, but all the colors in the Atman need to be also in the heart. The rules I found in the box (Osprey Games) are much better and clearer than the ones I read.

Once the rules are clear, they aren’t very hard to teach, you can do in under 14 minutes. I love the name of the game.

The art of the game is great. The cards are of good quality but I always sleeve my cards and when you do that, they no longer fit back into the box :( (a minor issue, but an issue nonetheless).

The theme is very cool and fresh.

The play is asymmetrical (a good thing) and, although we lost the game twice, I found the decisions needed to play it aren’t that hard or deep. The Ravens of Thri Sahashri wasn’t exciting or fun for us. If you play as the boy you have more decisions to take (how many cards to draw from the deck into the atman, how to place the cards into the atman), there are some rules about how to do this, but they aren’t complex. If you play as the girl your choices are much simpler (you take a card from the atman). The game is unique, but not very fun. All the clues need to be done non verbally, an idea I love in Hanabi, but here it fell flat. Due to this, there can’t be an alpha player (a plus in cooperative games).

There are three sealed envelopes in the game, you are supposed to open the first one as soon as you win the game once, but we didn’t. Still I love this idea. I cannot comment about the sleeves but I guess they add more content to the game and/or they change the rules. A very cool idea and the only one that gave me pause before selling the game.

There is considerable luck of the draw with the cards and with the ravens. With clever play and experience you can mitigate it, but you cannot eliminate it. It doesn’t bother me though because the game plays rather fast and it is a cooperative game.

Bottom line, I was expecting a better game from The Ravens of Thri Sahashri. We played it twice and lost both times but the second play through we did vastly better than the first one. I wanted to play it again to beat the game but my SO said the game was too boring so we played another game instead. I also find it unexciting. I really wanted to beat the game at least once to open an envelope but we lost the interest after the second play. I already sold the game so I won’t ever know about the envelopes. It is, however, an unique game. The decisions needed to play it aren’t hard and I was expecting a deeper game, perhaps that’s my main disappointment.

The game consists of memory cards (numbered 1-5 in 5 colors, each with a special ability and a four-sectioned pattern on clear and cloudy squares) and 5 raven cards, 1 in each color. In the game, one player draws cards, as many as they want, and then adds some or all of the memory cards to the middle of the table in a grid of overlapping "tiles" governed by the cloudy and clear squares. Raven cards drawn are put into their own row next to the memory row and any cards that should be discarded of a certain color go under the matching raven instead. The raven row is adjacent to the memory row and protects the cards that are placed next to them from getting collected by ravens. 

The other player meanwhile has four face-down cards that comprise her "heart". Each turn she will take a card from the center of the table and place it adjacent to the top card. The rows must complete in numeric value, one to the next, in a pattern of 7-7-7-5. This "poem", though, is not complete until the colors of the face-down heart cards matches the color of the cards in the center of the table after the rows have been built. As an option instead of taking a card, the heart player can discard cards from the middle, communicating to the first player which colors should not be added to the table. No talking is allowed. There are also certain patterns that reveal heart cards and abilities on cards that can be used after they are added to the poem. When a poem is complete, all cards (except heart cards) that match the color of the ravens in the raven row are removed from the game, making the game harder as each phase progresses. The poem needs to be completed 3 times for the players to win. The 3rd poem must be completed in 3-4 rounds, but the heart cards previously saved can be used to help.

Really it is the balance of actions that can be both good and bad that make the game so interesting. You need the raven row to prevent all ravens from coming into play (a loss condition), but they will also eat your cards and diminish your chances to win. You need to discard cards to communicate undesired colors, but it causes delay and you cannot reshuffle until a poem is complete (going through the entire deck is a loss condition). These points of tension make Ravens an exceptional experience and worth the effort to wrap your head around.

Beautiful visually, good thematically. Very difficult game to learn, and the rules really aren't that clear. Lots of arbitrary terms in the rulebook, which play to the theme but makes trying to actually parse the rules difficult. But once you get the hang of it, definitely try going through the entire "campaign" included with the game, it's quite rewarding and a lovely story.

Unas mecánicas algo complejas y confusas al principio, con un sistema cooperativo que debería jugarse en silencio, no parecía ser la mejor receta para crear un buen juego a dos, pero qué va! El juego es una auténtica adicción, con unos mecanismos muy interesantes y una estética fabulosa. Si a esto le sumamos los sobres que van aumentando la dificultad progresivamente, estamos ante un auténtico juegazo para dos jugadores!!

A nicely odd little puzzle. Mostly impressed by the way in which the supernatural story and "open this envelope when you win your first game" prize make the first couple of shonky, misread-rule games feel like in-character failures, with no temptation to blame the underexplained rules and call it a win.

At first i thought this game a 5 or 6. But after coming to grips with it's intricate systems and understanding how it all works, I love it.  At first the mechanisms don't seem intuitive, but as you and your partner fail over and over, it will eventually "click" and you are in for a wonderful little cooperative experience.  

It is like a 2 player version of mysterium.

A rulebook a bit clearer on gameplay and lighter on story, would have made this easier to grasp.  Although i do love the story.

This game is a gem.
Unbelievable depth. A lot to discover.
But you definately need a partner to slowly discover the nuances of the game over several plays.
Unique theme. Unique mechanisms. Asymmetrical sides.
Sure, the Ren player has less to do and less decisions to make on her turn. But these decisions so crutial that her role is as important as Feth´s.

The strategy of this game is rather unintuitive and the rulebook I think suffers as a result. I think I'm playing it right? I can totally see people playing this almost randomly without understanding the strategy at all. After all it might seem you just draw as much as you think you get something useful and stop, and that Ren has nearly no option at all. However, it appears very long term clock management is extremely important, while getting the 7 set of a color in the Atman can be very crucial. adding several layers to the decision of when to stop drawing. Also, Ren has to consider how the Atman cards will be oriented (will she make it hard to place more cards, or make it so her next card take will split the Atman) besides considering colors. Add to that the card abilities and you have a game that can definitely leave the wrong first impression of being broken but has more depth underneath.

Obviously, one of the draws of this game is that it is an assymetric co-op game that requires true cooperation and alpha gaming is impossible. Ren definitely has less to do, but her single action can have large ramifications in the game.

I've only opened the first two envelopes, but while thematic I'm not sure if such a system was necessary. Don't want to have spoilers but note if you feel like something is missing or imbalanced in this game check the envelopes out.

Quite impressed by the production values. I like anime style art but even if you don't the art is good, the cards are very large, and the box case is like one of those fancy cases for holding multiple books together.

EDIT: Apparently I've been playing a couple of rules wrong, with the actual game making the game more nuanced, especially making Ren's actions a lot more important and giving out a lot more information. I really like how the game while seemingly really luck dependent on when you draw the ravens actually has a lot of mechanisms that counteract bad luck (e.g. safety row for ravens, if there is a 7 of a color in the atman but there isn't a matching color in the heart to score, you at least get more information that that color isn't in Ren's heart). I think I like the scoring mode of the original rules better than the current Osprey version, at least after you have played through the envelope "campaign" once, as the original has the sum of the scored cards mattering (0-3 = normal ending, 4-10 = good ending, 11+ with 2+ ravens scored = happy ending)

Amazing asymmetrical co-op deduction game that requires alot of in-depth thinking. The game is difficult to grasp at first but once you have the rules down it all comes together. Each player has their own puzzle, Feth must fix Ren's memories but also give Ren cards to work with so she can tell him the contents of her heart in the only way she can. Ren has to answer Feth's silent questions or hint as to what you do or don't want to be apart of the puzzle. Lovely puzzle game that I would reccomend anytime save for little ones

The Ravens of Thri Sahashri ist schon ein ganz besonderes, kleines Spiel. Zuerst wäre da die große Einstiegshürde zu nennen. Ich habe mir 2 unterschiedliche Let´s Play Videos angeschaut und danach die Anleitung gelesen und selbst dann war die erste Runde holprig. Ich möchte damit Niemanden abschrecken, sondern ermutigen, sich dieser Hürde zu stellen, denn es lohnt sich. Anders als Zee vom Dice Tower finde ich das Thema weder deplatziert noch austauschbar - im Gegenteil. Natürlich ist The Ravens of Thri Sahashri ein sehr abstraktes Puzzlespiel, aber es profitiert unglaublich stark von dem sehr mystischen und intensiven Thema. Kurz und knapp geht es um das Mädchen Ren, welches ihre Erinnerung verloren hat. Sie scheint eine sehr bewegte Vergangenheit zu haben und die Aufgabe des anderen Spielers ist es, die Erinnerungen zu reparieren. Beide Spieler nutzen dabei Karten, die wie ein Puzzle zusammen gelegt werden und unterschiedliche Farben haben. Die Farben und Zahlen der Karten müssen dann passend zu der verdeckten Auslage von Ren passen. Dabei dürfen die Spieler nicht kommunizieren. Die Namensgebenden Raben erschweren den Prozess, denn sie fressen die Erinnerungen und müssen beseitigt werden. Insgesamt müssen die Spieler drei Träume (Runden) schaffen, um das Spiel zu gewinnen. Danach öffnet man einen der drei versiegelten Briefumschläge. Darauf wird die Story vorangetrieben und die Regeln für die nächsten Partien festgestelt (es wird noch schwieriger!). Hat man das Ganze drei mal geschafft, hat man Ren´s Erinnerungen repariert. The Ravens of Tri Sahashri ist spannend, intensiv und eine extreme Puzzleerfahrung. Das Thema ist grandios, die Karten von überragender Qualität und das Artwork spitze. Ein kleines, feines Spiel, dass mich extrem beeindruckt hat.

If there's one thing that's likely to impress me these days, it's uniqueness. Having played over 700 games in the past few years, it's very rare that I come across a game that makes me think 'ooh, I've never seen this before'. The Ravens of Thri Sahashri is one such game. 

It's an asymmetric 2p-only co-op in which one player represents Ren, a Japanese courtesan who has fallen into a coma, and the other her friend Feth, who is trying to help save Ren's memories from being devoured by metaphorical ravens. 

If that wasn't unusual enough, the mechanics feel very fresh too. One touchstone is the silent and subtle hint-giving of Hanabi. But Ravens adds an interesting spatial element atop that, with Feth tiling and overlapping cards to construct a kind of 'brain map'. 

Osprey Games have quickly become a real publisher to watch for me. They combine excellent taste in their choice of games to reprint with production values that live up to that.

Let me just start off by saying that this game is weird. The theme, the art, and the mechanics are unique in a way that it felt like a mad scientist designed this game just to be different. Let me set up the mood, its a 2 player co-op that allows no table talk and the story is that one person plays a girl in a coma while one person plays as a boy to find her memories while fighting off these ravens that are trying to steal the girl's memories. I bought this game because of it's complexity and only consisting of 40 cards. I do however, enjoy this game. It plays really quick and I like the co-op aspect of this game. Is this game for everyone? Absolutely not, its a very niche game. If you're looking for a game that strays away from traditional board game design then this might be the game for you. I like that you really need to keep track of all the cards and have a lot of trust in your partner to provide/take the cards you need at crucial moments in the game to beat it. I think this game has the ability to grow on me as I do like certain elements of the game but I can only play this game with a specific type of hardcore gamer.

Read the rules again and hoped for the best. Realistically though, it's a very beautiful game and quite intense for a small asymmetric co-op.

On one hand, It involves giving each other hints in a Hanabi like fashion and on the other it requires you to put some thought into solving a puzzle with the memory cards. It is a bit more solitaire than I would prefer though, as one player (playing the boy) clearly has more to do than the other. But the hints that the other player gives are still super important. Even though this 2 player co-op game comes in a small box, it needs quite some tablespace, and with its gamelength certainly does not qualify as a filler. Good game for a lazy Sunday afternoon.

Credit goes to the designer for coming up with such a cool theme that honestly, rather fits the mechanism. Probably not too surprising since this game came from a Japanese designer and all. 

Ravens is a 2-player coop where players take on the role of Feth and Ren in search of a way to unravel Ren's dreams and to wake up from a coma. Feth must build a dream scape and Ren must unlock a dream sequence woven into strands of poetry. The theme is all nice and elegant though the game play is a bit fiddly and not intuitive. I had to read and reread the rules a few time to make sure I got the difference between a Raven being discarded or being chased away. Not intuitive! However, like all games, after a few plays, these rules should melt into the game play.

I like Ravens fine as a co-op and the game is not terribly complicated though can feel rather open ended in the beginning. The strategies are not out in the open and easy to grasp, but I do think there are some subtle nuances to the game which we have yet to explore. Question is, will we have a chance to explore these subtleties?

Update: Having successfully completed the first game and opening up the envelope, the restrictions imposed for the subsequent game sounds impossible to complete. Apparently, the first game was merely a tutorial and the original rules in the Japanese version is found in the variant rules. Yikes!

This game is quite challenging, even just playing one round. The art is fantastic. I wish I could say that I would play it more often, since I love cooperative games and this one is definitely unique, but the imbalance between the two roles bothers me. Also, I almost never get to play two-player-only games, and the hidden information nature of this one means it isn't soloable.

A love story journey into zen, buddhism, and Japanese poetry. A co-op two player card game. The boy can travel into the girl's coma to make her atman memories whole in an overlapping color and value card puzzle. Wasted memories get eaten by the Ravens of Thri Sahashri. Within her morose coma the girl can use some of these flashes of memory in her sad frail poetry in the form of a dodoitsu.  Deep themed and deep thinking puzzle where strategy depends on the ability of communicating the needs of her hidden heart only by the choices of cards selected. Feth, the memory builderr role, has to do the heavy lifting in this one with so many aspects in the game to consider. A single two sided sheet of rules clearly explains the story and the rules of play. Wow.

An amazing 2-player asymmetric cooperative game! The theme is about a boy and a girl who have fallen in love, but in trying to escape the girl's horrible life, tragedy happens, someone is killed, and the girl falls into a coma. Now the boy must delve into her mind to attempt to wake her up.

The game is a lot of fun, and made even better by the two players not being able to talk strategy during the game. The game is not that difficult to play, but it's a very tough game to teach, given the unique nature of it. Some rules are circular, in that you won't quite understand the individual pieces until you've first understood the entirety of the game. Luckily the rules are quite short.

I look forward to playing this a lot!

Rating is after one game and is likely to change as we open the packages.

We won the first game but have decided not to open the first package yet so we can play the first level of difficulty more in case we just had beginners luck.

This is currently the best cooperative game I have ever played.  The no communication rule is really what makes it work.  Too many cooperative games the person that is best at the game can help the other players out too much for it to feel like everyone is totally necessary.  The balance of this perfect that both people need to be involved and know what needs to be done.

Hoping the game gets more difficult because I am not a fan of non-competitive games that you win all the time.  I prefer something that a win feels very special.

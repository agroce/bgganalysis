RATING: N/A
The most convoluted, complex set of rules I have ever seen. After several days of trying to work through the "walkthrough" rules (which are just a restatement of the full game rulebook) I was still at a loss as to how to proceed with even the opening round. 
Add to that the fact that, while you play as Klingons or the Federation, most of the non-generic crew available are sworn enemies--Shinzon, Jem-Hadar characters, Centurion Bochra, Lore, are all available crew members for a Klingon or Federation captain. Meanwhile, if you decide to play as Captain Sisko, there are nearly no DS9 characters with which to crew your vessel. 
Shaka. When the walls fell. 
Not a good Star Trek game, and not good board game either. If you are a Star Trek fan, there is no reason to play it.

I was so disappointed. I thought "Mage Knight + Star Trek"? Should be a win. Well, although it's interesting how the Mage Knight mechanics were re-imagined for the Star Trek theme, here is a list of my disappointments after playing through the "First Reconnaissance" mission: Components: where the Mage Knight art is bright and beautiful and elicits a sense of "magic," Frontiers art provides screen captures from the TNG and DS9 shows for its card "art" and all other components are dark and a bit muddy such that it's difficult to tell what's what. (Note: screen captures don't bother me in "Firefly: The Game" probably because I still have a craving for the show and want it to live a second life in the game) Where the cards (linen) and boards (thick and stay flat) in Mage Knight are of the highest quality, Frontiers' cards are thin and one board was warped and kept spinning every time we touched it. Game Play: yes, I can see how the mechanics map but there is some missing depth. All Warbirds seemed the same and pretty easy. I never had that sense of adventure as I do with Mage Knight - like I want to go into the tomb to see if I'm prepared to get that reward. Away missions never gave me that same feeling. I'm sure those who analyze games more than I do understand why. I just know that I was ready for the game to be over. We immediately pulled out Mage Knight, oohed and aahed anew over the art and the components and the day and night differences and the beautiful painted heroes and cities and gorgeous art work on the cards and then looked at Frontiers and agreed the game would not be staying in our collection.

RATING: 9
I am not a solo gamer but this system is so amazing that I easily lose 3 hours exploring the galaxy.  It also captures the Star Trek theme very well including the difficult decisions that those characters faced in many episodes.  Coming from a non Mage Knight background I found the rulebooks hard to parse and the font just too small, please use bigger font in any enhanced edition and a glossary would be a good addition.  The only other down point is the dark nature of the tokens I get that it is thematic, but brighter colours would help me see them.  Just an incredible game.

+ Very enjoyable solo experience, building your capabilties, exploring the galaxy.

- If plays didn't take so long, I would play this a lot more often.

- The art is a bit bland. Not sure if I would like it if I hadn't seen so much Star Trek in the past.

- I can't imagine this being fun at more than 1 player, just because it would take so long. Then again, if both can do thinking during the other's turn. I'm curious about the PvP and coop features, though.

RATING: 9
Rating after a few solo plays on the first reconnaissance scenario. Has potential to rise as I get more comfortable with the rules and see how the borg cube attacks work. Good mechanisms. I expect this will become a great solo deckbuilder for me.

***Edit 3/7/17: Have started playing conquest and since I'm more familiar with the rules, the game flows much faster and smoother. Very, very enjoyable.

***Edit 4/4/17: I've been playing a bunch more solo games over the last month, as the wife hasn't wanted to play much in the evenings lately. The more I play other solo games, the more brightly this game shines in comparison.

I owned Mage Knight, marveled at its pretty art and many, many moving parts. I couldn't trade that away fast enough. How it is then that this version--similarly taxing, similarly cramped rules manual, similarly wonky gears mashing together to move, or recruit, or even visit a planet--somehow outshines the original MK? 

I bought both as purely solo experiences, but this is the one that delivers on the promise.

3 games played

Pros:
Aesthetically pleasing.  Almost good enough to mislead you to think you’re actually playing a game based on Star Trek
Good game mechanics

Cons:
Low replay-ability.  Highly repetitive scenarios/gameplay.   Game is not dynamic at all.  Plays the same every time.
Feels like players are doing their own thing most games
Low excitement 
Anti-climatic ending
Fake thematic:  Other than the pictures/game pieces, nothing about this game feels Star Trek
Challenging to learn the rules, but strategy-wise, the game is very simple
 
Most Damning:
Me: “You know. I don’t think I like this game much. It’s not really the type of game I like.”
Friend: “I liked it, but I wouldn’t want to play it again for another 3-4 months.”

Frontiers is a reskin of Mage Knight. As such it plays nearly identically. Even so, even though I was familiar with Mage Knight, it was murder to learn, partly because everything had a new term and it was almost impossible to transfer knowledge from one game to the other. There are problems with the retheme as well, since players, even Federation players, are given the opportunity to do things most Fed commanders would not with no diplomatic alternative. Though if you want a Fed commander who IS willing to decimate a Class M planet, Sisko is your boy. If you already have Mage Knight, just play that.

MK is one of my favorite games, and I'm a huge ST fan, so this was a no-brainer. I like that this isn't simply a reskin: certain changes have made the game less fiddly/convoluted, though the game is still complex. The away team mechanic is interesting (and thematic) but IMO unnecessary because it severely lessens the usefulness of units from how they were in the base game. The designers have also gotten rid of the day/night cycle, there are no fortified enemies, partial blocking of damage is now allowed, and you can attack from an adjacent space.

The end result is that this game is really fun, but also a little too easy. Being able to attack from an adjacent space means you don't need to generate movement before a battle, making it much easier to generate attack. Similarly, since you can partially block damage, it's not a big deal if you take wounds (since you will be able to reduce them with partial blocks). 

Overall, it's Mage Knight Lite: still a fun, epic experience, but not one that will put you through the ringer.

This is an initial rating - so take it with a grain of salt - but the depth and solving aspects of this game excited me on every turn.  No wasted time, just brain-activity goodness.

Mechanics follow Mage knight close, only a few changes to streamline the game. The quality of the components are not as good as original, cards feel cheap, and the art is not as good. I prefer the theme of Mage Knight but I am not a Star Trek fanatic either, so take it as you want. I do like some of the changes but the game is still a beast to get out and play, so if I got to pick one to invest the time in it would be Mage knight. Not opposed to ST:F, the mechanics are solid and the game works, but I don't see the need in owning both.

First impression: Really struggling with the graphics compared to MK. So much harder to perceive/distinguish in so-so light. I'm normally not such a baby about such things, but the MK system is such a drain to play as-is, I have a hard time imagine I'll enjoy it with that additional barrier added. I really want to like this.

Well, that was a surprise. Mage Knight is one of our favorite games, but Star Trek: Frontiers was a big disappointment. The board is bland, the cards are bland, the miniatures are lumpy and bland, the "gems" are just flattened lumps of plastic. Even the box is bland bland bland. And the gameplay itself is too easy and too much the same. The war birds, for instance, all feel the same and you encounter a LOT of them, where in Mage Knight, the enemies are quite varied.  Sigh. I really can't recommend this. It's a bland and uninspired package all around.

I was very worried about this game. All I heard was that it was a beast to learn and teach. Admittedly, this took about 45 minutes to learn...but once things started to click, it came together nicely.  There are some minor quibbles Id like to address. 1st the quality of the cards...I understand they wanted to keep the price point below a certain cost...but blech, not a fan. The box size/ insert is stupid!! How in the hell were you supposed to get all those tokens in there with out spending 45 minutes gently making it work??! Overall, my biggest complaint is the component quality. My husband and I are big Trek people and enjoyed this. I have zero intrest in the original Mage Knight, but I found this to be quite enjoyable.

Mage Knight is one of my favorite games of all time, and ST: TNG one of my favorite TV series, so hard to really go wrong here.  Do I need both?  Not personally, but my friends prefer Mage Knight's theme, and my son wouldn't touch Mage Knight and will play this instead... so, guess I'm keeping both.  The way I see it, I now have another big box expansion to Mage Knight... same old mechanics, but fresh new takes on the game, especially with the Away Missions mechanic.  Brings some interesting choices to make, given that you have to deal with Repair of ship damage and Heal of crew/captain wounds separately.  Combination assaults where you have to deal with ship battles followed by away missions in the same turn provide fresh new "puzzles" to solve with the cards you have to work with.  Definitely a blast to play.  Oh, and I agree with another person's comment... I miss having an equivalent to artifacts as well.

(2016/07/08) So far we have played this once in full coop and won easily in 4 turns. The changes to night/day and removal of many of the map obstacles make this game feel easier.  In particular, it will come as no surprise that the basic full coop scenario is not comparable either in challenge or excitement of the General Volkare scenario in the largest Mage Knight: Lost Legion expansion. While it is unfair to compare a base game coop scenario and expansion co-op scenario that is probably one of the best ever designed, Frontiers feels so far like it has little to offer to players with MK and all expansions on the co-op front. I will be withholding judgement until we have had the opportunity to play the competitive scenarios.

On the plus side, the away mission mechanic is an improvement to MK, which permits Diplomacy abilities to remain relevant until the end of the game for some players. Removal of day/night and artifacts, on the other hand, may simplify the game but at first experience made it feel less rich. One might argue that if someone is playing this system, it is not for simplicity.

Essentially a Mage Knight reskin. There are some tweaks but it feels basically the same to play. I personally don't have a strong preference between generic fantasy and Star Trek, so they get the same rating. To quickly summarize my feelings, I enjoy playing these games as romps but can't take them too serious as games. There's some light puzzle aspects, but mostly you just tear around the countryside/galaxy killing orcs/romulans and looting them for all they're worth until you're strong enough to take on dragons/borg spheres. The problem is that I always get the feeling (in fact this is the case for a lot of this designer's games) that he couldn't properly figure out how to decide on a winner and so at the end you just count up every possible thing you could have gotten and they're all worth one or two points. It's always very anticlimactic. If you want to play it, play it to see how exciting of turns you can put together and don't worry so much about the score at the end. Honestly this is probably too high of a rating to give a non-game, but it is a lot of fun to play,

==============================================================
[u]Start Trek vs Mage knight[/u]

1. no day and night 
2. movement cost is never more then 4
3. two fewer terrain types 
4. only 3 crystal colors instead of 4 
5.one new "mystery" die
6. there are no artifacts 
7. Cities have been substituted by Borgs ships
8. there are 8 encounter types instead of 7
9. no longer siege attack, Combat works like this: 
If an enemy can be handled with Diplomacy, this happens first. 
Next is Long Range Attack. Then the enemy attacks you, and you block (you no longer have to block ALL of an attack. Partial blocks work, and you only take damage from the remainder (i.e. if you get attacked for 5 and block 3, you only take 2). Finally, the normal attack phase.
10. Skills are similar.
Scenarios: First Reconnaissance, Full Conquest, Blitz Conquest, Full Coop, Blitz Coop, Conquer and Hold and One to Return are in both and Liberate the Research Stations is essentially Mines Liberation.
The final scenario in ST:F is called Where No One Has Gone Before and is unique to ST:F and is about exploring as many tiles as possible.
There is no analog for Druid Nights nor Dungeon Lords. ST:F has 10 total, MK 11.

===============================================================

Some of the differences:
1. You always get +1 Experience (ie Fame) when you explore
2. There is no day/night
3. A new mana (now "data") type of purple which can be used as purple to power some rare cards or rerolled
4. black still powers "undiscovered" items (ie spells) but is not limited to just night-time.
5. There is no artifacts deck - spells and artifacts are merged into one deck.
6. Unfortified sites are re-themed as planets you can beam down to, taking one or more crew with you as well as your "captain"
7. Units cannot soak up damage when fighting enemy space-craft (the rampaging enemies and "fortified" sites).
8. Your captain and units can be "wounded" and "healed"; your ship can be "damaged" and "repaired". i.e. there is a new type of "wound" and now two types of "healing". Magical glades have become docking stations where you can repair your ship, and villages are ports where you can heal your crew/captain. A wounded captain is a very bad thing!
9. You do not need Movement to assault adjacent locations, you just assault it as your action.
10. You can use Diplomacy (i.e. influence) to overcome enemies on planets you beam down to, to avoid a fight.

Great play mechanics. I like the changes to streamline the ruleset for this game from MK.  Only small gripe I have is the data chits.  I wish they were a bit thicker to ease picking them up.

Compared to Mage Knight they have improved some things and made other things worse:

Worse than Mage Knight:
- The design is extremely bad. You can barely differentiate the different recruiting icons on the crew cards. It is an almost black romulan star base on a black background. everything is very dark and has little contrast.
- the game is considerably easier.
- even though they have simplified some rules, they have added a hand full of new rules, like away teams and the distinction between Healing and Repairing. These new rules don't add much to the game either.
the artwork is so very bad, I just couldn't look at. No kidding, I sold this game, because the artwork ruined it for me. Mage Knight looks better, so I kept that. This is very unfortunate, because I actually prefer the Star Trek theme.

Better than Mage Knight:
- they have simplified some rules, that never really added any depth to Mage Knight anyways. (Unfortunately they seem to have missed to adjust the difficulty accordingly)
- the components themselves (apart from the design) are of good, sometimes even better quality than Mage Knight.

I've always wanted to try Mage Knight but avoided it because of the generic fantasy theme. When I saw all the glowing reviews for this game claiming it's a streamlined version of MK I was sold.

If this is streamlined I'd hate to see MK. This has one of the worst rule books I've ever seen. Long and boring and poorly organized with tiny tiny font. I gave up trying to find anything in the rulebook and just had to watch video playthroughs to learn the game.

In the end I found the mechanics overwhelmed the theme and the game doesn't do a good job of capturing the spirit of Star Trek. I already have a better more streamlined deck building space exploration game... Emergence Event. It plays quicker does a good job of telling stories, and has a solid rulebook. How can Wizkids be so successful when they have such poor quality control and rulebooks? I just don't understand. The Walkthrough is a small novel rather than the QuickStart guide it should be.

I must say that I do like the mechanics. There are lots of interesting choices to be made and once you learn the rules it even flows well... It's just not fun. There was never a moment where my heart raced, my palms started to sweat, or a smile crossed my face. Too much work (setup time and rules lookups) for too little enjoyment. Honestly the game felt more like work than play.

A fan made story/paragraph style away missions. I'll give that a try before giving up on this completely...

I rather enjoy this re-skinning of Mage Knight. I think the theme fits a bit better here.  There are sufficient changes to make this feel like it isn't just a pure re-theme though.  I generally liked all the simplifications of the Mage Knight system.  The only potential drawback is the reduction from 4 to 3 colors of mana.  It tended to pigeon-hole effects a bit too much to me.  I think my favorite changes are the simplified movement (in part due to the removal of the day/night cycle) and the Away Missions (particularly the situations where these are paired with Space Battles in the same combat).  The biggest problem here is that it has been made demonstrably easier than Mage Knight. While I've played about 6 solo conquest MK games, my highest score there was 203, while my first three playthroughs here netted me scores of 257, 225, and 240.  I would definitely still play this due to the theming and refinement of the system.  However, I'd like to see an expansion that would add some difficulty.

Long story short, this is Mage Knight with the Star Trek theme. Playing this game was a nice trip down memory lane for me, as it reminded me of how much I enjoyed Mage Knight early on in the hobby. At the same time, WizKids didn't go out of their way to fix a lot of the problems with the original game, mainly when it comes to the rule book. Can we please get a clear, concise, and well-written rule book that doesn't include an introductory guide? It really feels like they gave the absolute minimal effort to present the rules in a decent form.

That aside, the system works pretty well, and they've cleaned up a lot of little things about the game while keeping the same feel intact. My one problem here, like with Fleet Captains, is how ridiculous the theme is portrayed. The story goes is that you're going through a wormhole to take down these Borg ships, but along the way you're recruiting...Shinzon? Why on Earth would Picard ever agree to have Shinzon be part of his crew? So the theme is presented in a pretty ridiculous way, and it would have made much more sense to include more Federation and Klingon characters, especially ones more specific than "Federation Officer," as people to recruit.

The system is still solid, however, even if a lot of things feel shoe-horned in for fan service and/or the mechanics to be present (i.e. Data Crystals). All in all, I think the Mage Knight theme fits better with this system, but I own this game, so there isn't really much of a reason to reacquire MK.

A VERY long and complex 1-4 player exploration/deck-building game.

My main complaint about the game is that it is LOOOOONG! I'm talking 3+ hours for two players to get through one of the shorter scenarios! Sure, being more familiar with the game would cut that down by maybe 30 minutes, but that is still a long playtime, especially for a supposedly "short" scenario!

I haven't even attempted one of the longer, more complex scenarios yet due to the long playtime and lack players I know who can stand to sit through this more than once!

A fun star trek themed game. Never played mage knight, so no preconceived notions going in. Would be ranked higher if scenarios were more varied and had higher round limits. Just as soon as you have a deck that's competitive and a crew that can handle most situations, the game is supposed to end. Feels like the emphasis is more on beat the clock than exploration. Have only played solo, maybe more players would change that sense. Original rank of 6.5.

Edit: Embarrassed to admit this, but had the game on the shelf for a few months (life happening, other games, etc) and decided to play another scenario. This time, read the entire detailed rulebook to refresh my memory and some gaps from before got filled. Played the solo conquest scenario and scored my highest score to date. AND IT WAS FUN!! I had always avoided damage like the plague, but I realized that to really get the most out the experience, you have to be willing to collect some damage cards. Even with damage knocking my score down a bit, it was the highest score I ever had. I learned that maximizing battles and encounters is the key. Some good fortune with the token reveals doesn't hurt, either. This just got a boost in rating from me.

Frontiers is a re-skin of the heavy low-luck adventure game Mage Knight Board Game into the Star Trek TNG universe.  The rules and gameplay are mostly identical to the original game.  However, this game does streamline out the day/night distinction, which is certainly a welcome change as that was just extra complexity for little benefit.  The other major change is the introduction of "away teams", which gives you another option--using diplomacy--to take on certain challenges.  While I did appreciate the extra use for diplomacy, I found it a little difficult to keep the extra rules straight.  On the whole, I think those who like Mage Knight will enjoy this as well.  I'm certainly one who appreciates this system, but I do struggle at times keeping all the rules in my head.

Very deep game that combines elements of deck-building,  map exploration, and many interesting choices. The Star Trek theme is quite well integrated (although I did find that optimal play for Picard often involves doing somewhat unthematic subjugation moves). I can see this being a good solo game as well.

Negatives: can be on the very long-side and overwhelming for new players; there really should be individual player aides that include expected enemy distributions and weapon symbols.

This is basically Star Trek themed Mage Knight.  Probably the two biggest differences are the addition of away missions and the removal of night rules.  I thought the addition of away missions made it much more thematically matched to the Star Trek universe, but it also added more complexity, which I suppose was cancelled by the night complexity of Mage Knight.  All in all, it has the same pluses and same negatives.  A great RPG game, but long and reading the rules is like trying to understand the mathematics behind the General Theory of Relativity.

RATING: 7
[thing=96848][/thing] is one of my favorite games, so I knew I had to give [thing=182340][/thing] a try.  It's mostly a straight retheme of Mage Knight.  Since fantasy is my favorite theme and I'm a very mild Star Trek fan, this was a downgrade for me.  But obviously, for some people it's a big upgrade.

There were a few minor changes.  Movement was slightly less painful because the average cost to move is lower than Mage Knight.  Also, a lot of the locations are interacted with from an adjacent space, so you don't have to move quite as many spaces.  So this was an upgrade.

There are also two different types of encounters now, space (like normal MK) and away missions where you send your crew (allies) and/or captain (you) to the planet.  We didn't really understand the away missions, so we played them like normal missions, but I believe this is a pretty major change.  Like if you go down to the planet and take a wound, the ship is kind of screwed.  Also, a lot of the enemies can be defeated with diplomacy, which I appreciate.

Ultimately, this is a rethemed Mage Knight.  If you love Mage Knight and Star Trek you should get it.  If not, you can probably pass.

Great game, marred by similar annoying reference issues that Mage Knight BG had. Some initial rules or token explanations found in the Walkthrough rulebook are not in the "Full" rulebook. Backgrounds of black space provide bad contrast for some iconography. Not all the icons are on reference cards or back of rulebooks. All of these are fine once you know the game I'm sure, but it makes an initial player have a harder time at it.

Demonstrated for 3 days. I found it night on unplayable with other people around. The systems are clunky, the attack modifiers can become rediculous very quickly and it requires a preposterous amount of time referring to the manual and cue cards for fringe cases or even basic explanations of symbols and their effects which are don't follow too much logic or pattern.

Overall I didn't find the complexity satisfying and was wresting it all the way rather than marvelling at its mechanical beauty. I felt so much more could have been done with the rule book, mechanics and the readability of components and symbols.

Might be really excellent as a computer game.  I really hope it happens. Or as a single player experience where you can peruse the books layed around you at will. But didn't work for me or anyone I've played it with.

Perhaps it was because I wasn't fully aware of all the categories to be scored...so it felt more random that it probably should have.

"Work together to defeat hostile ships or compete to explore and uncover hidden mysteries." YES!  To go boldly.. where no man/woman/machine/nerd.. has gone.. before.. again. I must wait a year or two (as per usual) and buy a used ("fixed" 6th printing) copy).. If the comments read well. They will. Hope it comes [i]with[/i] an Item Shop and Quest Deck... there's another $40.00. edit: 'Well, that didn't happen.'

It's out! It appears the fan expansions will make it a keeper, once again. Live long and prosper, modders! Can hardly wait to download and print up all those scenarios, variants and add-ons... I'm not sure the vanilla copy can satisfy the itch for space exploration, but neither did the series. Official expansions are also a possibility.

Still wondering what "Abrahms-Trek" is.

Vlaada is brilliant, but this is a well implemented redesign that makes some clunkier of aspects of Mage Knight a bit more intuitive. There is a place in this world for both. I like the Lost Legion expansion quite a bit from MK, but I think in most cases, I would break this out when playing with new players to the system.

I've gotten several plays of this and Star Trek Ascendancy finally. Both great fun! I much prefer Ascendancy though. I won't compare ST:F and ST:A further because they are totally different games with different purposes. That being said, for solo play and two person then ST:F is necessary. More than that, ST:A would probably be better (expansions out soon too). My biggest problem with this game is the complexity and rules. I don't know how it could be simpler except through repeated plays. But if you don't play often you have to spend some time relearning. I suppose if you want a really deep game and have the time/will to give it, then this game is ideal.
Also, the artwork on the cards are too dark and the tiles could have clearer images.

Hard to compare this to other games I rank similarly.  This is my top ranked hand management adventure style game.  Is it better than TM or AFFO?  Would I rather play this or one of those other two?  I think it depends on my mood and what I want to do.  This scratches a different itch.  I prefer this over MK.  I think the expansion will only make me like this one more.

Co-op / Solo

I've never played MageKnight before, so I cannot make any comparisons. I had fun playing solo mission. From what I have seen, the Dummy Player is a good idea to help balance co-op and solo play. I can't wait to play with another player. I definitely recommend using the variant rules for combat. In solo, i just rolled the dice instead of choosing the colour. Adds more flavor. 

The ships are nice if not a bit too small. 

I do have some criticism regarding the experience tracker. It seems like a waste of space, Although this is coming from a solo play experience. 

And finally, I  think WizKid has a lot to learn from other companies regarding there rulebooks. No Index ? come on. 

Other than that I had some good fun playing

Finally starting to learn this. After numerous solo games where I made major mistakes and bailed, I got to play with someone who knew Mage Knight and had a good sense of how things worked. One game of Blitz Conquest took 6 hours, but it all came together. Now I can't wait to play again.

A good solid thinky/puzzly type space dungeon crawl. Have only played solo so far but am keen to try competitively with two.

Only gripes really are I would like to have seen more characters for recruiting and not all the characters make as much sense as they could eg loads of characters are way better than Data but in reality Data would trump them all and I can't see Klingons hiring Romulans/Jem 'Hadar. I guess this is a result of the pasted on theme but it still works well.

Mage Knight is one of my most prized games, and this is not only updated, streamlined, but also with a changed theme that allows to draw different audiences.

Mage Knight light! Still a great game and a better introduction to the system. While the painting is basically only a coating it looks still better than what is in mage knights base game.

Havent played mage knight, to me this is a pure gem! Deep thinking and strategy involved, i like that very much. Cant get enough from gameplay and the theme. Steep learning curve for me, but the game rewards me more than enough now. Played solo only.

A deck management game favoring efficiency, this game has interesting decisions to be made on most turns.  Rules were a chore to work out in some parts, and some of their iconography decisions are awful.  It uses the same symbol for shields (sometimes) and defense and those two things work differently.  Also the damage types and resistances were not intuitive and were not included on player aids (only on the back of the rule book).  Overall the mechanics and theme work well and make for an engaging game once you invest a lot time to learn and play it.

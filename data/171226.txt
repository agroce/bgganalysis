Two-player head-to-head blast 'em game. Why is it that these types of games (MtG?) have to have 20 health points? The card play is cute: you have to build up a column to get to the 'good' cards. And you can use the back of a card as a default 2 hits. But you can flip cards too - and there's no way to know what's on the other side without fantastic memory or constantly looking. I dunno. Not sure there's a lot of variety in this.

Juego para 2 jugadores, con ciertas mecácnicas curiosas (parte oculta/visible de la carta). A falta de jugar con más naves y más cartas en modo completo para valorarlo mejor.

RATING: 7.1
Great 2 player game, very inexpensive, good fun and quick to set-up and play.  It has cool innovative game mechanics, lots of strategy with some luck.  A player can get a bad draw and lose even if they are the best strategist.  I think this is a good thing, it is quick to play so you can play best of 3 which should balance it out a bit.

Games are meant to be fun, some games like chess (I play a lot of chess) the stronger player always wins which is not a lot of fun for the other player.

The idea of applying an effect everytime it becomes visible again is great and makes for fun gameplay and chain reactions. For the same reason, this game is clearly for gamers.

Rating may go up as I play more against competitive players and upgrade to Skirmish & Deckbuilding mode.

Bought the game; spent 30 minutes learning it and explaining it; conceded at the end of the second round when the score was 15-3 and my opponent still had 7 ships on the board to my 2 because he drew useful cards and I drew garbage; packed it up and put it away. The chained effects seem cool, and I guess I'll play it again some time, but wow that wasn't fun at all.

Du coup, les annonces de jeux rethématisés se multiplient (Timeline SW, carcassonne SW (sic !), perplexus SW, ...). Et bien starfighter ... ça n'a rien à voir...Ah si, c'est de la SF, et c'est de l’affrontement de vaisseaux spatiaux.

Didn't click for me in the first three plays. Could not follow any strategy due to the luck based card draws and limited number of cards to play each turn. 

No final opinion yet.

RATING: 8
Had a few goes of it.  It's mechanically quite simple, but the combo-building can be complex and a hell of a lot of fun to pull off when you get one working the way you want it to.

Out of the box, the game is very much affected by luck of the draw, but I do not feel that it is dependent on it.  Many times I ended up with hands of only L3 cards and still managed to pull off some good stuff using L0s to set up other stuff.  In fact, I lost a game precisely because I made a bad decision, not because I was left with cruddy cards.  If you can learn to work with what you have, you'll find you can break all kinds of placement rules because the effects allow you to manipulate the cards as you see fit.

The better part is that you can apply effects to your opponent's board, often upsetting their own combo strategies.

This is simply a wonderful game of back-and-forth and the only detriment - I think - is that in order to do the deck-building variant, you should own two copies of this game.  I don't think it's worth owning two copies, so the straight-up random draw is going to be where it stays for me.

Juego de combos con un toque original. Algunas cosas cuesta un pelín verlas, por los giros que pueden dar las cartas, pero tiene decisiones interesantes y distintas formas de ganar. La pega es que la asimetría de los tableros no es más que una desventaja para un jugador, que estará aún más a merced del azar del mazo de cartas.

RATING: 6
Starfighter is a perfectly interesting uber-tactical card game with just the thinnest veneer of space battle theme.  We enjoyed deciding where, when  and how to play our cards and how to make best use of card abilities. But I did find that the wide variety of cards that could be drawn from the face-down deck and the fact that _these_ are the cards you must play, was a little tiring. Easy enough to draw a shitty hand while your opponent lands a better one. Some thoughtful card play can mitigate a bad draw (or take down your opponent's strong hand) but I couldn't wipe from my mind that the game is too much decided by the cards you draw. So that's fine; games of chance and fate have their place. And I like those types of games, but I have too many of them. There are some distinguishing aspects to the mechanics of Startfighter that get my respect. But the fiddlyness of flipping and moving cards all the time rubbed me not in the best way and the spatial-puzzle exercise-ness of the game made me forget about the space theme a little too much to get drawn into the atmosphere. So overall, good. Just not great.

The game works. And is chaotic. At least in the first play. I assume that as you get used to the icons and start to remember what is on the reverse of the card that you played, or at least when you start to make long-term (for the whole round) plans that really work, then you may start to enjoy the game.
However if I am to choose between this one and Neutoshima Hex... then it's a no-brainer. I choose NsHex.
Otherwise - the idea behind the game (although a little fiddly) is ingenious - all these combos that emerge almost from nothing are cool.

It is rare to come across a 2p card game that is truly innovative. Even more rarely will I come across such a game that I have not heard anything about. How is this game virtually unknown on BGG?! 

One of the games I tried this year (2016) that made me say "wow!" about 10 minutes into my first play. I love games that have so much space for clever combos. The spatial element is brilliant design. If you play 2p card games, you owe it to yourself to check this game out.

Unfortunately, the cards are not balanced. Some are strictly better than others. With a more balanced deck, this would easily score 9 or higher.

Un très bon jeu de carte avec un super mécanisme qui colle au thème. Il se passe toujours quelque chose et nous ne sommes jamais au bout de nos surprises.

Thoughts after 5 plays - This is a game I really want to like and I thought was right up my alley, but I think I may have been wrong.  I even watched a playthrough before I bought it and thought it looked awesome.  I'm just not finding the moves/combos you can pull off to be that compelling.  I may give it a few more plays, but there's no strong desire to play this on my part.

FUN: really clever tactical puzzle with a nice scifi theme.

UNIQUE: the card flipping, card rotating and the shifting boards: everything feels unique.

NEGATIVES: the basic game is a bit too basic and the advanced game is a bit too much too handle when you play for the first time, so you basically need 2 back to back plays to understand and enjoy the game.

Starfighter is a clever card game with tactical choices galore. Clever double sided cards with powers on both halves of each side make for interesting play, and combos galore. Powers activate each time they become visible so you have real options. Highly recommend from me, though the initial learning curve may put people off.

[b]Starfighter[/b] was sold via auction 2/14/16.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]After 1/2 a dozen plays my excitement over the game fizzled out. While the game mechanisms were fun and original there wasn't enough card variety to sustain repeated play. Definitely one I was glad to try, but not a game I need to own with the amount of competition in my collection for 2p games.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Wow this game is vicious, you can destroy someone quick if they aren't paying attention. 
- Games last about 15 to 20 minutes [i](which is the perfect length considering the random nature of the card draws.[/i]
- If you like building card combos this is the game for you, it is possible to chain together 3 or 4 moves by playing 1 card.
- There are 4 different ship boards included and I was quite surprised by how they changed your strategy.
- Innovation, the combination of having to pay attention to your ship board and the way you play cards is unlike anything I've played before. 

This is a really hard game to describe without visuals, I'd highly recommend you check out [geekurl=/video/78697/starfighter/video-review]Marco's video overview[/geekurl], he does a great job explaining the mechanics of the game. It is easier to understand once you see how the board/cards interact.

All that said I'm not sure how long this game will last in our collection since we have so many 2p games and I have a feeling this game could get old do to the limited card pool. However; I definitely think this is a game worth checking out.[/i]

A perfect example of all that is wrong with BGG. Here is a fast, cheap, two player game with very original mechanics, eay set up, SET IN SPACE, and it gets less attention than candy land.

Update:  initial enthusiasm was  horribly misguided. This game blows.

RATING: 6.5
There are some interesting mechanics such as the initiative and battle resolution, however all the rotating and flipping cards gets annoying as you can't remember what is underneath then or what your opponent has, so there is a lot of checking to see what would happen if I rotated this or flipped that. Otherwise the game is fairly interesting but after two plays I'm not so sure how many more times before the initial interest int he machanics wears out.

A good effort.  It's always nice to have a heads-up space combat game that can be played quickly.  The rules are sharp and intuitive, and the game is thinky and tense.  That said, there are a few problems:  black bordered cards get scuffed easily, the art is somewhat minimal, and the theme is somewhat abstracted...it didn't necessarily NEED to be a space game, and that takes a bit away from it. But, I like it enough to give a somewhat cautious recommendation.

RATING: 8
Better than anticipated!

A card game of combos, combos, combos - set in space. There is a cool spatial thing going on with the big ships maneuvering alongside the fighters.

I have only one caveat about the game: that timeline. Gosh, the story is pure bs! It almost made me put the game back on the shelf without playing it. This would actually prevent me from investing in the Total War feature, if for any reason I became interested in doing that (so good thing the game doesn't have expansions, I think).

RATING: 5
A combo-heavy puzzle game disguised a space combat game. Initial plays are positive. You play cards onto your board in hopes of having enough fighter ships visible in order to damage your opponent. The catch is that a lot of the cards let you move or flip your opponent's cards, which will usually hide some of their fighters and weaken their attacks. Really unique. It was also a nice touch to include multiple boards, so you can play mirror matches or play with slightly asymmetric boards.

The game has almost everything I could want: simple rules, asymmetry, fast play time, an unobtrusive and slight catch-up mechanic, well-balanced cards.

My [i]only[/i] issue keeping this from being a 9 or 10 is that, at least so far, it seems like the luck of the draw can largely determine the winner. As I mentioned the cards seem to be well-balanced, but sometimes you just don't draw a good counter to what your opponent is doing. Even the strongest cards in the game can be countered by being moved, flipped, or destroyed outright, but sometimes you just don't have a card that will let you do that. That can result in at least one round where you take a lot of damage or you have to waste your own cards just to try to defend against a heavy attack. This can also result in some blow-out games where one person takes almost no damage before getting their decisive victory.

Still, the game is fast and fun enough that I can live with the card draw issue. This game is definitely worth playing, and for around $20 online it's a steal.

Update: I've played a few times now and I'm still a little torn. When you have the right cards, you really feel like you're making some smart combos and shutting down the other player. It feels good to play and still feels unique. But when you don't have the right cards, it can feel like you can't do much as you watch your opponent doing all of the cool combos after he got just the right cards. It just feels like the luck of the draw determines everything.

Probably one the most underrated games I know of. A very unique, and very confrontative game filled to the brim with awesome combos. Passing and shifting the boards is a great mechanism creating very dramatic decisions: Do I not play these cards but have the decision over how we are situated and let my opponent play their cards uninterrupted or do i play more cards? Because of the spatial elements it can also feel a bit like chess in a good way, and i say this as someone who's not a fan of chess. It isn't a really thematic game but it is a unique experience, so if you are okay with the game mechanism telling the story of a battle, and don't expect something that's thematic in a usual way, not reading flavor text but instead just feeling like fleets maneuver around you might love this. I haven't even tried to play constructed decks, and don't generally like constructed formats, but just the fact you can do it is interesting too. If the words card and combo sound good to you, you must give this a try.

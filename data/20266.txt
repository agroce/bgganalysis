Very weak system. Advancing through the enemy is faster than moving through unprotected ground, much gaminess re: attacking with lower strength for better results, crazy CRT table (1-1 in clear has 3 positive  outcomes for attacker, at three different levels of success, one result which is neutral at best and a good thing for attacker in most cases, and two defeat results, both equal to the least severe success result in terms of retreat/losses). Balance issues with scenario too as Germans, with average die rolls, in historical setup, can cut off 1/2 of russian forces on the map before the russians can even react. I thought I would like this game but I actually ended up hating it. Production levels very high though.

Stunning graphic for a great game. My only doubt is about compass clarifications about combat system, for it makes impossible to outright kill high speed unit if not surrounding them. Unrealistic, expecially when a whole panzerdivision attacks a tank brigade.

After one play as the Soviets that went the full 26 turns. The game ended in a German tactical victory.

Bitter End is an engrossing, fascinating, thrilling, and infuriating battle for the reduction/relief of Budapest. Players on both sides will require aggressive play, force management, and risk-taking to ensure their chance at a win. 

Most games of this sort are steam rollers for one side until the defense can hang on long enough (and well enough) to receive reinforcements and slowly rebuild their strength for the third-reel counter offensive. Not so Bitter End. Both sides will have their periods of attacking and defending, though the Germans seem to have the lion's share of attacking and the Russians must grin and bear it through the lean times of bad weather and no reinforcements until the sun peeks through the clouds and the clank of fresh armored formations can be heard coming up the road.

For the Germans, pedal-to-the-metal dash and vigor are required in reaching Budapest as soon as possible. Once the city is tagged, the next task is to build a defensive line along key terrain and hang on to the objectives you've acquired.

For the Russians, the on-ging task is to reduce the Budapest garrison as quickly as possible. In the early turns, as much force as possible must be preserved in the best terrain you can find. Cutting roads and isolating Germans whenever possible is also important. After January 9, you must become aggressive (but not reckless) and find ways to isolate/destroy the Germans and drive deep to recover objective cities.

Since being out of supply doesn't kill you, even isolated units can be real pains in your opponent's back-side if used judiciously. Both sides need thick hides and not lose hope. The Russians particularly, since the Germans typically enjoy armor and divisional integrity advantages over the Russians in battles.

On the whole, I think the German side enjoys an edge over the Russians. Their units are tougher on both attack and defense. Their divisions are smaller (which, by the rules, means they routinely enjoy "integrity" advantages over the Russians), they have more armored formations (another bump in most battles), and fuel considerations are never an issue for them. 

A huge chunk of the Russian OB is tied up in Budapest and is not released when the garrison is reduced, but on a particular calendar date whether they're reduced or not. Several divisions are stuck on the map until either the Germans attack them or the calendar releases them. 

It sure seems like the Russians are made to follow a script while the Germans have a freer hand. But, despite that, the Russians have a genuine shot at winning. They just need keen judgement in knowing when to retreat, when to attack, when to be patient, and when to take a calculated risk.

This is not a casual, sit-down-and-play game. The system itself is not difficult to learn, but it will take an average of about an hour per turn as you learn the system and slowly bleed units as you learn things the hard way. It will kill a weekend, even a long one.

Overall, I had a great time, since there was a variety of challenges to meet throughout the game. Most turns offered both hope and despair. I'd probably play again, but would be happier if it were more of a multi-player or club event.

A few solo plays indicate that this isn't just a pretty game, but a clean one. Rules are well written and easy to take onboard, and play aids are excellent. It's a quick-playing game (I'd estimate half an hour per turn max). A few rules areas that I dislike, but nothing too significant. If you're looking for a reasonably simple, attractive, and fast-playing game on this campaign (with some variants and options), this is well worth considering.

Compass and Todd Davis are to be commended for producing a game with this level of production value as one of their first efforts.

Fresh out of the box (October 2006).  My mum as a little girl saw the whole thing unfold when the Red "liberators" arrived.  They had a Katyusha battery in her town, Fot (3 hexes from east edge on northern map) firing into Budapest.  Weeks before they had Germans, then Russians, then Germans, then Russians, ... billeted in the town.

A very good game, and well balanced.  As with all Compass Games the map, counters, and the rest of the game is of high quality.  The game is not too long although it can last a while if the battles are evenly matched.  The people at Compass Games were very prompt and helpful when I asked them questions concerning the rules.  I would definitely recommend this game.

RATING: 10
A brilliant recreation of a little-gamed battle. Both players must attack and defend at the same time, due to the nature of the siege and relief operations. Hard for the German player to win, but they'll probably have the most fun. Subtle combat system, combining step losses and movement points for retreats. Excellent map graphics and large counters.

This is pretty much a straight reprint of the 1983 version with updated graphics; and despite carrying forward some out-of-date mechanics (particularly as to ZOCs), this is a really fun GAME.  It is not, however, a particularly good simulation with the standard scenario.  I would say that playing the variant "ultra-historical" scenario gets you much closer to the severe limitations the Germans faced in executing an offensive of this magnitude in 1945 -- and is recommended.

The German player has to be aggressive, and most of my games devolved into a wild swirling battle with just about all of the units on the board out of supply at any given time.  But again, that was part of the fun.

The components are very good.  The rules are straight forward and easy to understand.

Very good: Operational - Eastern Front - Easy/medium

Plus:
-Revolutionary graphics
-Stunning Map and player Aids
-Great Theme / Strategic situation
-Very accesible with 10 pages of rules 
-Low counter densityx (except for Budapest)
-Innovations: you can choose to either take step loss or retreat a number of hexes

Minus:
-Watch out that the map does not rip on the folds
-The combat systems has it's quircks and is not intuitive like many other hex & counter wargames

General comments:
Excellent game and Compass indeed set a new standard in the industry. The graphics and counters are wonderful and the stuation is the most interesting I have come across in a hex & counter game: Budapest is a game within a game. Although limited and difficult for the Germans, it has various strategies and it is getting really excited and you try everything to relieve your besieged comrades. If you like accesible yet detailsed hex & counter games this is for you.

The short six turn scenario was a very fun play and it went to the last couple of movements before the outcome was decided. Great game, it's a keeper!

I have to give this some more praise! It is still the best game anyone could buy for the price offered. The Rules, the maps, the counters, the setup charts and everything else including game play is excellent. If you like Eastern Front games, Battle of the Bulge games, late WWII battles where both side have a chance or even games like Caesar Epic Battle of Alesai where there is actually two battles going on at the same time, this has all that and more. It's like having two battles at the same time, the battle around Budapest and the battle of the relieving forces. Both side have many decisions to make. It plays well solitaire or with 2 players, I could even see 4 players having it out in this one, two for each side. The armored silhouettes are very cool, as I always love pushing around different types of armor and who doesn't like to push a King Tiger a few hexes. Yes there are even NATO alternative counters for you old school guys. Let me not forget, besides the Germans & Soviet units, there are Hungarian & Rumanian units as well. Really, if you want to buy a good wargame, this is it. Good job guys!

Update 2013:

About every year or so I play this game. I have played the Historical Scenario, The Northern Attack Scenario, the Ultra-Historical Scenario and the Historical Scenario again with both the Additional units/counters and the Ultra-Historical units/counters, which was a blast using everything. I have played all four games Solo, and found it wasn't too long, spreading out playing times over a week here and there.

A bigger game than the description would indicate - I'd guess it needs *at least* 10-12 hours to finish.  And you need to use at least the German free set up variant to give the German player a shot at creating his own interesting plan.  It compensates for the easier time given the Germans by making Budapest much too easy to take - it's impossible to see the city holding out as long as it did in real life without house rules.

Mechanically, it was ahead of its time, with a fairly interesting combat system and a well thought through move-attack-exploit system.  Unfortunately, twenty five years (or so) have seen newer designs leap frog it and there are elements that will leave you scratching your head. (units that can survive indefinitely when out of supply, etc.)  It works on its own merits, but the historical purist will be annoyed by its shortcomings.

This is a very solid package from Compass Games. 
The quality of components are some of the highest Ive seen in a wargame and combined with its surprisingly low price this is an incredibly good value buy.
The rules are well thought out and errata is almost nonexistent (although there is a very important rules change in regards to retreating).
There is a short 6 turn scenario which should be playable in under 4 hours and on its own (combined with variable deployment) is very enjoyable and replayable. 
There are then two much more epic campaign games taking more along the lines of 10 hours to get through and with the variation rules and deployments should play very differently every time.

Complaints: Im not 100% happy with the way combat results are applied. It seems to work well in a design for effect sense but can lead to some kind of weird retreats/advances at times.

Unfortunately takes up a bit too much room and takes too long for me to give it more than an 8 by the bgg rating guidelines..

RATING: 6
Not a bad game, just not a great one either. The subject matter is interesting but the game is quite a challenge for the German player, and can be frustrating for both players. Components are top notch, but something in the game play just misses the mark. It takes over 25 hours to play the game, the only other scenario being an impossible 6 turn introductory game. The mechanics of the game are quite interesting, gameplay itself for some reason moves slowly. Perhaps a great game for 2 really dedicated wargamers.

[02/23/2009] 1 play of the 6-turn scenario. The combat mechanism takes a little getting used to, and I'm still not sure I like the retreat MP/loss rule. However, you get used to it and learn to change your thinking. And it's worth the effort, as this is a solid game with both sides attacking and defending.

A terrifying situation: The Axis in Budapest is besieged by the Soviets.  Meanwhile the German army and Hungarians are trying to break the siege.  There is a lot of tension in this one.  I love the components.  Rules are clear enough and the game plays well.

Beautiful game on a fascinating topic, which is the German drive to relieve Budapest.  It takes awhile to get your head wrapped around the combat/retreat rules and I still seem to forget things during the various turns.  It's a game where the terrain rules take precedence over just about everything else.

RATING: 7
Hammer and tongs Ostfront game that ultimately can't overcome the limitations of its 8-track tape era mechanics. It's not so much that it fails to simulate the campaign as it just doesn't feel like a credible account of running a desperate armored offensive in the middle of winter at the end of a long supply line. The Budapest fighting, meanwhile, is a drag, a lot of dicing for a foregone conclusion: the eventual collapse of the garrison. Upped a point for the excellent graphics work on the map and play aids.

 The CRT (Combat Results Table) for this game is kind
of strange using a bleed off system. Had the
right idea as units may have been mauled very badly or understrength but not sure 
if this was the way to go about it.
 The affected units kind of "morph" territory and regrow under this system. Nice Counters and graphics in this game.
 Historically very well researched battle of a little known German Counteroffensive late in WW II that headed 
East into Hungary against advancing Russian Units. 
This German Offensive was a doppelganger to the Battle of the Bulge.

Just as the Battle of the Bulge was drawing to a close, the fight for Budapest was beginning. One has been done to death in wargaming. The other? Not so much. That is a shame since the Battle for Budapest is an interesting and very bloody battle to simulate.

This game is a reprint of a former "grail game" by Hobby Japan and it is for the most part, a straight reprint of the original (with a major graphics upgrade). I'm fine with this since the original was a great game, albeit difficult to win as the Soviets. There is an advanced version of the game that puts historical limitations on the Germans and makes it (IMHO) a better game than the original. 

A good game and proof that you can reprint a game and improve it instead of reprinting it and making it worse (I'm looking at you, Decision Games!).

This is the Bulge game for the Eastern Front.
-----

Components.  The detail on map art is great.  At first glance is may seem to all blend together, but once you've figured out what each type of terrain looks like there's a nice flow to the artwork.  The counters are also very nice.  Armored units give you a pick - either NATO icons or pictures of armored vehicles.  Other units are NATO icons.  Play aids - there are several included, all in color, and they pretty much give you all the info you need that you would not want to sift through the rules or charts to get.

Rules.  Seem to be a pretty tight development.  Writing style is easy to follow, setup makes it easy to reference, and there are several examples of play to illustrate the rules that are key / have a bit more meat to them.  The downside may be the font which is slightly on the small side, but nothing that will irritate folks in any large numbers.

Setup and play.  Playaids give you deployment areas in which you can set up your major formations.  Based off this, setup can go a little long, but on the flip side it's nice since it gives you the ability to adjust your units as you see fit.  The first few turns may also take a bit to play out until players get the feel for how to use the terrain mainly due to how it influences combat losses (see below).  Beyond that the simple sequence of play keeps things moving quickly & free of drawn out procedures.

Combat.  Just adding this since it's a bit different from other games.  The CRT gives you results that can be satisfied in terms of lost steps or MPs retreated.  The key here is to have terrain that you can retreat through to the rear if you are pushed back.  Otheriwse combat is a simple odds based system influenced by a small handful of DRMs (division integrity, armor, etc...).

What's not to like?  Some may not like the ability to make a poor odds attack and simply pull back to avoid losses, just to move back into that position in the Exploit movement phase (Todd Davis has some nice "very" optional rules, one of which makes attacker losses mandatory to deal with this).  The only other thing that immediately jumps out is that movement (due to the movement and exploit movement phase) gives this a very mobile feel even in relatively restricted terrain.  Neither of these impacted me as something that ruins the games play or the gaming experience, but I'm sure someone will disagree.

Other recommendation : if you are new to this game and it's CRT system, I'd say play the short 6 turn scenario before hitting the campaign.

Other pluses : the scenarios.  There are several that limit or free the German player in terms of combat and deployment or add in new units which should vastly aid replayability (for example - an assumption that the Battle of the Bulge didn't happen for example).  There are also about 11 extra units included as a variant (along with some new rules) that are from an old Perry Moore article that adds yet another level of replayability and historical flavor.

What a clever game! I haven't played anything like this, and can't wait to bring it to the table again. It speeds right along and offers a fun bit of number crunching and enjoyable auctioning. You can easily play in 30 minutes as well. Stefan Dorra is one of the most talented designers out there... his games just keep on appealing to me.

One of those rare games that I enjoy more the more I play it. On your turn you choose between auctioning shops or moving potential customers around the board.  When customers of your shop's colour arrive outside your door, they come inside and pay you lots of moolah.  Marracash sets up tough choices between the one and the other.  It also asks difficult questions about the value of each shop.  This depends on proximity to an entrance to the souk, how many shoppers of your colour remain to enter, and how likely other players are to allow them to head your way.  

Production quality is decent.  The artwork is ordinary but functional.  The rules are clear.

Brilliant conception.  Turn order is critical.  Can't help wondering if it would be even better with some rule tweaks, for example, allow arbitrary deals between players instead of fixed kickbacks—it never killed [gameid=122]

RATING: 7
This is another ‘simple rules and deep game-play’ type of game, my favourite gaming ingredients. I suspect it plays better with four than with three as it just tightens up the game. 

It lacks a little excitement that is the only thing I hold against it, that could change with more plays though.

Elegant and simple (once you figure out how multiple payments work).  Another light, but not too light game from Dorra.  Do you maximize your own stores or help out an opponent&#039;s for a piece of the profits.  If anything, the game often feels like it&#039;s over just when it&#039;s getting started (some have actually bought extra copies so they could extend the game with more meeples.)

Disliked by my group, there's just too little here. Moving patrons into shops of a Moroccan mall is simply blah.

Amazingly simple rules, which are easy to pick back up after years on a shelf.  The production works for me, outside of the samey player signs.  I could see liking board art too, with the right theming.  Probably the most fragile game I own.  It often gets played 2x between visits, with players thinking they have a plan for the second game, and concluding at the end of it that they know less now than when they started.  Definitely recommend for fans of Chicago Express, consider it to be in the same galaxy.

The game is very easy to teach, but its simplicity disguises some interesting decisions to make that pop up during the game--whether to move pieces from the gates, sharing the profits with someone in order to prevent them from taking all the profits, ignoring those choices to further personal fortunes, etc.  Very good with the possibility of moving up.

:d10-3::d10-4:

1/2016: The 3-player game is fragile. One player can't allow the other two to dictate the flow of customers. That said, I think it's probably better than the 4-player game. Players have more control over customer flow, which makes the incentive play stronger.

3/2014: In the same vein as Bridges of Shangri-La, Marracash is about incentive manipulation, spatial positioning, and timing/sequencing of actions. I'm not thrilled with this one, as it seems a bit swingy for my tastes. But I can tell I've only skimmed the surface of [i]Good Play[/i]. Another half dozen plays should help clarify whether this is truly a 6 or if it's more like an 8 or 10.

RATING: 7.75
An elegant, tactical, open and deterministic auction game that plays quickly. Despite the simple rules and old age, it is a meaty game with original and refreshing mechanics.

In MarraCash, players are trying to balance out between helping only themselves, while helping others simultaneously.  Players must sell shop space, or buy shop space, and try to guide customers into shops so they can make money. In a nice twist, players gain commissions for sales and for guiding customers into opponents' shops; so there are reasons for moving customers into shops even if they're not your own. This facet of the game, and the fact that there are queues of customers, ensures a nice flow to the game. Beginning players will have a difficult time gauging how much a shop is worth (location matters of course), and so it probably needs multiple plays to really get a good handle on the mechanism.

[Originally got it used on eBay, but then it for Pueblo. I regretted getting rid of it and managed to get it for a great price in a BGG auction.]

Game definately needs a play to get an idea of valuation and game flow.  My first game of this I enjoyed but there were some very submoptimal moves.  Really not a favorite of anyone else that played it (and probably will not play again with those guys).  It can get deep and thinky for such a short game.

I give it a 6.5.  I'd like to play with some experienced players.

I waited quite a long time to try this game and it was worth the wait.  It is simply an auction game where you are trying o buy shops in a town.  On your turn you get 2 actions where you can either put up a shop for auction (winning a cut if you don't win it yourself) or move a group of people around town.  If the right people move in front of a shop they like then they go in and stay there, scoring money to the person who owns the shop (and a cut for whomever moves the pawns).  The playtime is short and the rules are easy.  There are options for some creative play and it is very much a fun game with good player interation. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Genius.  The rules are simple.  It plays quickly, no game ever drags. There's visualization, calculation, manipulation.  There's some evaluation in the auctions, but the auctions don't overwhelm the game.  There is some spatial planning. There's balancing the short term and the long term.  Great ingenuity in giving players just enough movement power to set up their opponents, not themselves, forcing people to cooperate to get points.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A decent bidding game also involving the movement of pieces on a board. Players auction off shops throughout a map, and also move pawns of various colors, which enter the shops and earn the owner cash.

The spatial aspect was interesting enough. For a first play, it was a bit hard to know how to value buildings, until you get to see how much cash each shop will likely earn throughout the game. Overall, an enjoyable game that I don't have enough interest to want to own.

RATING: 7
One of the most unfair sixes I can imagine giving. I'm almost certain it will go up on further plays. What is not to like? Short, brutal auction game of perfect information, incentives, and scraping off the top. Anyone familiar with my tastes would think it was right in my wheelhouse. Alas, 1am on the second day of a con was not the time to try and wrap my head around it; I couldn't get the hang of valuation, nor see what might constitute good play. I look forward to trying again.

4 plays, 4p (different groups) - fast, intriguing game, a possible masterpiece...? Seems like an original and adroit mix of mechanics, fairly simple gameplay with a range of choices, sometimes very tough choices. Impels rapt attention, leaning forward.  Also turns move quickly. 'Tis a fun game, a painful smartie, a serious game with a nice flow of mechanics.  And how about that impressive, elusive, teasing strategic feel? I think strategies float on the tidal drift of group behavior, not absolutes. Takes less than an hour.

RATING: 8
Marracash is an old-school game from Stefan Dorra that has been often overlooked. 

The game depicts the city with a large number of unclaimed shop stalls in various colors, a number of fountains, one at each intersection, and a teeming horde of customers standing outside waiting to get in. The game begins with each player auctioning a single stall of their choice, and then play begins proceeding around the table. On each turn you can either move a group from a fountain to the next fountain and move another group; move a group and auction a stall; or auction 2 stalls. 

The goal of all of this is to make money, as customers are sucked into shops of their color when they walk by. If you own the shop you get 100 for them and 100 for each person that was already in your shop (as customers are never removed once they go in; make of that what you will thematically!) up to a maximum of 500 per entrant. However, the person who moved the group that deposited that person in your shop also gets a cut out of your earnings, and that goes up as the number of people in there goes up. There is a similar payment made to the person who auctions a new shop.

Because the currency you use to bid on the auctions is the same thing that is used to calculate the game winner the proceedings can be a little slow in the auction, but I like a lot of the ideas in this one. The variable queue of customers outside changes things up considerably, and adds a strategic element when paired with the auctions as you can see who is going to come in and that can dramatically impact the value of some stalls.

Helping out other players is not only beneficial but necessary, if someone is going to make a big score you can at least take a cut out of it and further your own gains in the process. The game might have some kingmaker issues, but I think with closed currency holdings that kind of thing (as in the deliberate choice between two players) should be at a minimum as it's very hard to keep track where all the money is between the auctions, the cuts from that, the customers, and the cuts from that. Because of the length I would classify this as filler, and for that game length this is an amazing title. Fun, would be glad to play any time. 

Players do need to be aware that this is a big-time left/right game though; ideally players are always presenting "gifts" to their left hand neighbor that score both of them points in the process. This can make the auction a bit weird (as stalls can easily be value-added if the auctioneer sets the shopper pieces up correctly prior to conducting an auction) as they generally have much higher value to the next player to take a turn, but this is really at the meat of the game. It can be susceptible to new player issues as a result though. Great regardless, so much going on for such a stripped-back game.

The German first edition has a problem with the wooden visitor pieces. They are really top-heavy and topped over all the time. Lining them up to form the visitor queue on the board is a bad idea. A slight tap on the board will make then fall over. :( Someone told me the newer editions have better visitors that are better balanced.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A nice game for an evening ender. It takes all of 5 minutes to explain and 30-45 to play with fully engaging decisions. What makes it stand out is the way you get a cut of auctioning shops (that other players buy) and moving customers (into other players' shops). You have to find that narrow space where co-ompetition lives such that you profit just enough along with others. 

I'm not sure I'll ever be good at this game, but I do enjoy the unique experience of trying to navigate that course where helping others helps me. For example, instead of letting someone get $500, you could move customers for them and get a cut of the fee such that they get $300 and you get $200. Or you each get $50 instead of them getting $100. These are the moves you need to find. 

Complicating matters is that there's a line of customers coming that you can see and try to anticipate by purchasing the shop(s) they want. So, you buy the "right" shop and put the "right" customers on the board at the end of your turn -- but your opponents will get to move the customers that you just placed long before you turn comes around again. Ai carumba! 

Oh, it's good fun trying to chain it all together in a way that works. My only complaint is that I'm not convinced as of yet that 3P is a good number for the game as it seems two players can get a good synergy going with the 3rd being locked out and not able to take advantage of competitively cooperating with someone.

I played this in my very early gaming days in the late 90s and I didn't much like it then. It's an auction game, and I'm bad at these basic auctions. I played this again a decade later, and I like it a little but not much. I can't see this being published as is today, it feels a little basic and unbalanced or unrefined. I think that today, there'd be some third option, maybe of changing the queue, or making people leave a shop. The balance of money in the game would be changed too, maybe everybody would start with a free shop but less money. There certainly is an interesting game here, moving tourists round the souk past shops you own is a nice combination of theme and mechanism. But maracash feels like it's lacking something, not necessarily more actions, but something to bring the players closer, maybe a turn-order mechanism rather than clockwise order. The rich get richer, getting shops and tourists early on gets you back in the game. Controlling the queue makes a big difference. Maybe the later players get to move three places, or maybe movement depends on the size of the tourist group (small groups move faster or alternately, the group moves as many places as people). Marracash is okay, but doesn't thrill me. But I am bad at auctions.

Auction game where players try to rent the best placed boutiques in order to attract customers.  Money is spent on bidding for the good spots and money is made through commissions and revenue from visitors.  Nice combination of planning and bidding.  Might possibly be a kingmaker problem in that the revenue increases radically as more and more visitors go into the same boutiques, so the initial revenues are meaningless compared to the endgame moves.  Still lots of fun and very ingenious.

Short, clever, very interesting game about semi-cooperation. It seems quite sensitive to whether other players gang up against or give the game to someone. Perhaps open money is the best solution to this.

Plays so quickly you could almost regard it as a filler game. There's usually a very fine line between winner and losers. The tiny sum you bid to get that shop that didn't attract quite as many customers as you had hoped it would often makes the difference. On the other hand, one customer more or less can make a huge difference, and a player's influence on who does or doesn't score big is somewhat limited even though the entire system has no random parts at all.

There are financial incentives for the auctioneer and for the mover, but more than just financial incentive you can diminish potential returns for other players by how you auction and move. There is tons of room for alliances in parts of the board while trying to differentiate from the same player on the other side of the board. Also, the way the patrons come on the board is going to make each game different. Looking forward to more plays.

I think what separates a good play from great play is being able to get the person on your right to make you mutually beneficial moves as offers, and making good move/offers to the person on your left. Trying to work those incentives so that you are benefiting off others' actions is what a lot of the game is about. This one is a gem.

Somehow I missed Marracash the first time around.  It's great!  I'm fascinated by games that force players to cooperate in order to win.  Marracash highlights these decisions in a way similar to Fifth Avenue, Modern Art, Titan the Arena, and Quo Vadis.  In each of these games, the seating order is an important consideration in forming temporary alliances.

Marracash is a funny game of attracting tourists to get the most profit. This game is devided into two parts. One is auctioning and bidding shops for customers. The other one is guide on visitors to get profits. The rule is quite simple, but the winning passage is not very simple. The game result is not decided by tactical planning, but by occasional prompt measures. For me, I am not fully satisfied the game mechanics. By the way, I agree Marrcash is a recommendable classic boardgame.

More strategy than first meets the eye here, not untypical for Dorra. Quite an elegant title with very little rules and fun to play. 

A unique and fast playing one hour auction game that has a bit of a coop aspect to it. Best with 4 and the only number I would want to play with. 

Excels as a one hour middle weight alternative to RA that I will request to play when time is short or as a good opener as well. RA is probably the better gateway game (this could work though) but between gaming friends I would probably request this one first. 

Rating could rise with more plays

Nice auction game that gives incentive to help other players. Watch other players though... I was allowed to build 3 shops, 2 adjacent, one across the street, and right near one of the entrances... I was able to bring in lots of customers by myself (I was almost playing solo and ran away with it). Hopefully if it's ever reprinted, it will have better bits for the customers (vs. these ones which fall over very easily)

RATING: 6
An auction and movement game that gets irregular play in my group. There is a bit of a learning curve to this one as the active player must decide how best to use his two actions. It's important to realise that your opponents will have the first chance to benefit from your building auction and the new shoppers that you may have introduced at the end of your turn. A game I would like to see more of.

RATING: 8
The rules for Marracash are amazingly stripped down. The board consists of markets in 5 colors connected by roads. There are three entrances to the city where customers enter. Customer pawns are colored to match the markets they'll spend money in. The city starts with 3 groups of 3 customers at the entrances and a randomly drawn line of customers waiting to get in that stretches around the board.

At first I thought the game was simply one of constantly shifting valuations based on the tactical positioning of customers in relation to where the owned shops were located. And that is a major part of the game. But in our second game other elements started to pop up. Negotiation of where to move customers. Shared revenue by guiding customers to other player's shops (the player moving the pawns gets a pretty decent cut). After the game as I was driving home, I started thinking of more elaborate and pointed negotiations that could have taken place. I saw a viable strategy for, especially early in the game, of intentionally sending customers to other player's stores to reduce their money intake. Making money from a shop you didn't pay for is a beautiful thing. Attention needs to be paid to who is entering the city before moving pieces from the entrances. I think there's quite a bit more to learn from this simple game. My one minor issue it that, due to the game's short length, it is almost impossible to recover if you don't set yourself up competitively in the first couple of turns. But, since the game is short (about 40 minutes), it won't be long before you get another crack at it.

RATING: 6
With its combination of a short playing time, simplicity and auction-based interaction it could be a precursor to current Winsome games such as Chicago Express. On your turn you get to take two actions which can be moving two groups of customers, moving a group and auctioning a shop or auctioning two shops. That's it. In-game currency is the single victory condition. Out of these deceivingly simple rules a deep game of valuation and cooperation evolves. Not at its best with three players but my inital 6/10 rating probably rises with four players.

I lost miserably at my first game, and would definitely play much differently the next time around.  The auctions ended up getting quite heated, and would probably always be so if all the players were experienced.  Don't underestimate the value of the entries!  I love the theme of this game and it seems very fresh and original.  Marracash plays quickly and is just simply a lot of fun.

Update: Even though it says for 3-4 players, I feel that the game loses enough with 3 players that I would only want to play it with 4.  There is much less tension in the auctions and less competition for tourist movement.

Economic game. Be careful not to overbid for a shop. The other players might prevent that visitors ever reach it. Be careful not to bid too low for a shop. Lots of visitors might generate a huge amount of cash. The unpredictability of the other players will determine the value of your investments. So, the amount of control you have is rather low. Nevertheless, buy the shops early and avoid buying too many shops. Tactical play with the visitors can be more rewarding in the endgame.

Another Dorra game that is simple, elegant and deeper than first blush.  Serves as an excellent gateway game or for gamers.  Lots of stuff happening, double-ending people procession, auctioning shops where timing is key, commissions tables for both visitors and auctions, tactical movements of visitors, etc.  Excellent and beautiful looking game (only wish the visitor pawns wouldn't roll around; meeples would work fine).  Has a slight similarity with Der Untergang von Pompeji.  One major hint must be addressed to inexperienced players is that:  it is "very powerful" for any one player to have two adjacent shops at one of the three gateways.  This can create a dominant runaway leader issue.

Quick brainburner where you seek to bring shoppers to your shop.  You also receive comission if you have them travel and visit an opponent's shop.  You can choose 2 actions on your turn:  1.  Auction two shops, 2.  Move a group of shoppers from one fountain to the next space twice (with shoppers leaving the group to shop at occupied shops, or 3.  move a group of shoppers from one fountain to the next and then auction a shop.  Player with the most money at the end of the game wins.

I can't think of another game that plays like this one. You have the auctioning of the businesses, then the moving of the "customers", all the while you have to help your opponents to often get equal gain, and other times just keep the customers to yourself.

This game is a hidden gem.  You are auctioning properties in a marketplace and you can also move tourists around a board to deliver them to owned locations.  There are some tricks as to when you try to deliver and which buildings you want to buy.  I did find the game a lot of fun but there is one issue.  The board appears way to big for what it is.  Players will cluster near the entry locations.  It seems that the game could be re-printed and there should be more entry locations.  But overall, it is a unique design that was a lot of fun.

I tend to enjoy games with random setups, open information, temporary alliances, and varied incentives, all of which Marracash has. The problem is that the game suffers from a turn order issue in which you want the weakest player to your right. If that player puts new pawns onto the wrong fountain or groups them the wrong way, the player that follows will likely capitalize. One such bad move can turn the tide of the game. With a full pool of competent players, I can this being very interesting.

MarraCash is an old gem from the 90s that one of our group members picked up a copy of. It's everything that I love about old Euro games that have unfortunately fallen out of favor. Instead of flooding you with a hundred mechanisms and an equal number of ways to score, the game rules are very simple and allow for direct player interaction through building and manipulating incentives. In order to do well, you'll have to work with your competition.

A good game, colorful, nicely thematic, no luck (unless you use the variant special cards), plays quickly. In our three-player games, the auctions have been a little dull, with the bidding rarely exceeding 500 Dirham for a store.  The idea of being able to share in your opponents' profits is a good one, but with the cuts so low, there's usually not enough incentive to do so. (The auctioneer's cuts work better.) Doesn't seem to reach the table very much, although my wife likes it, despite the auction mechanism. [5 plays]

After one play - simple rules with a fairly deep strategy.  Easy to explain, fast to set up, neat mechanics.  There's a tension between trying to do yourself as much good as possible, but knowing that you have to help others in order for it to work out for you, that's unique to Marracash I think.

Marracash [nope, not Marrakech or Marrakesh... get it straight!] is a perfect information auction game, which seems stupid when you think about it. The problem is that it's also a shared-pieces and shared-profits game, so everything you buy you're depending on the other players to make profitable for you.

The game is unlike anything else I'm familiar with, and quite surprisingly heavier than its simple game structure would suggest. This is probably my poster-child example for the "kind of games" I wish were still being put out regularly. It has shades of Acquire, Torres, Hansa, Samurai, and the like. The game is wholly interactive.

Bid for shops, then move different colored tokens into them (or into other player&#039;s shops) to score points. It&#039;s not a bad game, it has a couple of neat mechanisms, but sometimes it feels some people are set up for a big score and there isn&#039;t too much you can do to prevent it.

Not many games have an expansion that introduce more luck into the game and detract from the experience, but count this in the list. It's an auction game with the twist that the shops you win in the auctions only become valuable if you can get other people buying shops just past yours so that other players will drag people into your shop along the way. Which means there can be a lot of subtle kingmaking if people have choices about which route to take to get similar playoffs, which is why I don't rate the game higher. But it's short enough and different enough to warrant the occasional play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
This is exactly the kind of elegant, interactive, short but deep Euro that I love the most. I wish more games like this were still being made. Essentially it's a game about incentives. You have only two actions in your own turn, but you need to use them in such a way that the other players are coerced into helping you out on their turns too. It reminded me quite a bit of Knizia's Quo Vadis? in the way the topology of the board drives collusion and competition between players. But I prefer it to QV because the negotiation is more implicit in the moves you make rather than explicit in what the players talk about.

This is an out of print game by Stefan Dorra (Amazonas, The Bucket King, For Sale, Intrige, Medina, Razzia, Turn the Tide). This was on my buy list and was surprised to find a used copy (but in excellent condition) at an online game store for $19. The players are shop owners in an old Moroccan Bazaar. Players select shops of specific color to put up for sale in sequential auctions.  One of the options a player has on his turn is to move a group of shoppers from one fountain to an adjacent one, and as they pass by a shop of their color, they enter the shop. This is the primary way players earn money, which at the end determines the winner. The game is fun and at the same time strategic and involves practically no luck.

I felt like the game end came prematurely. If I were to suggest a modification, it would be to limit to 1-3 (instead of 2-4) the number of shoppers (visitors) that are brought in to each of the city entrance fountains. This would allow more time for longer term strategical planning. The tough strategic decisions include which shops to put up for auction, how much is a shop put up for auction by another player is worth, which group(s) of shoppers to move and where, and which set of shoppers to bring onto the board at the end of one's turn. These options offer a nice and varied blend of tough decision making choices. We did not use the Souvenir Cards variant.

One complain about the shape of the visitors pawns. They are wooden and nice, but the bases are too small and makes them unstable. During handling they tend to fall over and roll on the table; very annoying.

Is a 1996 simple auction and movement game in a bazar were you can lead clients to stores for the commission and/or you can be a store owner and earn money. The player with most money at the end is the winner.

Extraordinarily happy combination of auction game and tactical movement game. One of those overlooked gems that badly deserves a reprint and a wider audience. Simple enough rules and considerable player interaction, high level of replayability, comfortably paced, and perhaps most surprisingly, quick: a three-player game will be over in an hour.

RATING: 6
Interesting auction and movement game.  After one play, I can see the neat auction choices and how the movement rules effect valuations.  There is a bit of a learning curve in realizing when a potential high scoring move might be available to the next player, which could require you to "take one for the team."  Whether that element is reduced with more experienced players is a factor in how much my rating for this game might rise.

An aesthetically pleasing game that is akin to watching raindrops fall on a plain that, over time, erodes and funnels water into deep, coursing canyons.  I know of no other game that feels like this.  Skillwise, the game a pleasant combination of spatial and numerical concerns, competition and cooperation.  For some, it will be jarring to play a game that allows a lot of marginal utility calculation and yet is heavily influenced by player-induced chaos (more so than Tigris and Euphrates), but to me, it seems just about the right weight for a 45-minute game.

See the "intense elegance" list I wrote about why this game rocks. 

It'll surprise you.

There's tremendous opportunities to manipulate the whole-game flow, set up choke-points and divesions. The opening matters more than you'd think.

The Mad Anthony Gamers have played this twice, and although I haven't come close to winning, I have really enjoyed this game. Purchasing the right shop can be so difficult; there is a neat element of chaos in that you never know where your opponenets will move the shoppers to once you set up shop.

Blech.  Didn't much like the auction or spatial mechanisms, and unless players play with a mind to not helping their opponents, it can devolve quickly into "no fun."  I couldn't muster up any interest for this one.

RATING: 7
An excellent, quick, interesting game that is long out of print and hard to find (generally) in the US.  I think that is a real shame.  Once you complete the variable setup it all depends on the decisions of the players.  Do you help your opponents a little in order to help yourself as well.  Do you help only yourself.  Fair amount of interaction with plenty of neat decisions.  [01/08/2011]

Marracash -- Played once; four-player.  

Not only does Marracash exemplify what I think of as "eurogame synergy" (streamlined rules and simple mechanics combining to make deeply interesting play and involving choices), but it does so while maintaining a unique feel.  

There are several choices which have immediate and long-lasting repercussions.  To name a few:
Which locations to purchase, and for how much.
And when to do so.
Which locations to auction (with the possibility of having to keep it).
And when to do so.
How many pawns (and what colors) to move to empty entrances.
Which entrances to move them to.
When to cause pawns to patronize opponents' shops (to reduce opponents' payouts and get yourself a cut).

Other games have overshadowed Marracash for years.  Sometimes new ain't better.

Great game about people moving.  Perhaps too dry and abstract for some, but I feel that there is more than enough apropriate theme.  Intriguing system where players want to manipulate crowds to take advantage of where other players will score.  You always want to be sure to get a cut of every action.  This game gives the feeling of having a great strategic depth.  I'd imagine that the more that this game is played the more it would reveal itself.  The only reason I don't give it a nine is that it is quite dependant on all players being aware of what leads they are giving away.

I like this one a lot.  It seems like the game would last longer, but it seems to usually be quite quick.  Has quite a puzzle element to it where you try to determine what would be your most profitable move (in terms of making you the most money, and partially to deny money to other players)

No, it's not a typo, Marra[i]Cash[/i] is just obviously a game about generating as much cash as possible. Yet it's the way you must generate this cash that makes the game so engaging, and so puzzling.

The setup is simple. In the market square, there are a variety of shops divided up into red, yellow, green, and blue. Around the outside of the square is a line of potential customer in the same four colors. As the game progresses, you and your fellow players will do two things: (1) auction off shops in the market square, and (2) move herds of customers through the market square streets. Whenever someone walks a customer past a shop of his matching color, that customer is compelled to enter the shop and spend money. What's more, the greater the number of customers in the shop, the more money new customers will spend (evidently, peer pressure is very high in the city).

And now here's the tricky part. First, it's not just the shop owner that makes money when new customers enter his shop. The person who moved the customers past the shop, and therefore initiated the sale, takes a cut of the profit -- right out of the pocket of the shop owner. Second, whenever a shop is auctioned off, the auctioneer takes a cut of the final sale price from the bank.

Given all of the above, you want to make sure you purchase the best shops -- preferably of a variety of colors and nearby the shops of your opponent so that no matter who is moving customers around the board, there is a good chance that you will make a profit. Second, you want to auction off the best shops (but maybe not too good) so that, if you don't buy it for cheap, you still get a sizable cut of the sale price. And finally, you want to move customers into your opponents' shops so that you can skim away a chunk of their profits and prevent them from cashing in big-time. But! -- you don't want to move too many of your opponent's customers into their stores lest you hand them the win. Better if you can manipulate them into sending customers your way so that you can pull in a larger chunk of the profit even if they do skim off the top.

In other words, the incentives are all over the place, and it's great! From a simple set of rules comes a complex web of competing influences. Balancing them all so that you pull in the most money is a challenge. My first game (and who am I kidding, my second and third) were a whirlwind of confusing yet intriguing string of decisions -- not only my own, but those of the other three players. Playing MarraCash is like trying to put together a mechanical watch without the manual. You might come up with something beautiful, but it will still be a mess. So try again!

For a game from 1996, the design is brilliant. However, I must say something about the components. Everything is functional if not dated -- maybe even a little gaudy. The production values are of their time. However, most disappointing is the lack of support for colorblind players. Let's just say that bright lighting will help if you play with people who have trouble differentiating colors.

Production value aside, though, the game is well worth tracking down.

A terrific game with great board and bits. Not much more than an abstract, but I always enjoy this one! Update: I still appreciate this streamlined, elegant Dorra design, but it has slipped in my ratings of late and no longer commands table time. I still like Marracash and would be happy to play this in the future, but no longer feel the need to own it, given the large number of games that I absolutely love that don't see enough play time.

The original bazaar board game is worth its place in history.  MarraCash is simple to learn but impossible to master.  It comes down to the basic problem of how much to help everyone else in order to help yourself?  Delicious auctions eat up precious cash while the customer queue whithers away.

After Matthew Gray created the new "Personal Recommendations System" (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/254274), I was excited to see that Marracash was my #1 recommended game since it was a game by Stefan Dorra that I'd never heard of before.  Therefore, I jumped at the chance to play it on the first weekend after that new system was launched.  Unfortunately, it turned out to be an auction game that just didn't grab me at all.  I'd be willing to play again sometime for sure to give it another chance, but given its relative rarity I'm not sure if that opportunity will arise.  Ah well, on to the next most recommended game, Timbuktu.

Nice uncluttered luckless auction game. Players guide tourist pawns around a marketplace; tourists get sucked into same-colored stalls if a player has previously bought them at auction.

Much is made of the revenue sharing, where the player moving the tourists gets a cut of the income when he brings them to someone else's stall. I don't see it. The cut seems so small to me that I wonder if the design wouldn't just be a little cleaner if that aspect weren't there.

It struck me that the key to the game is obtaining stalls where you will be able to bring at least five tourists, as those stalls make the real money. So, you either obtain those stalls yourself, or make sure your opponents are paying as much as possible for them. Attractive concept, as it seems like you should theoretically always be able to figure out which incorrect valuations allowed the winner to win.

I inherently don't much like auctions, categorizing them under "too many options to consider" as an aspect I try to avoid in games. It strikes me that MarraCash would be relatively easily modified to be more enjoyable for me if the stall auctions were replaced with a card market or something. (Though, it wouldn't be luckless anymore.)

Great little game that holds something for everyone. A game can be played in little more than an hour and is usually tense, as downtime is low and the best decision is not necessarily the one that makes the most profit in a single turn. Players can work together to keep the shoppers out of the leader's stores, but only at the expense of their own opportunities. This game just never seems to get old. My only gripe would be that the optional rule (souvenir cards) does not add anything to the main game.

This is somewhat reminiscent of Hansa, in that part of the game is making sure that the next player doesn't have an optimum move to take, but there's also some semi-cooperation taking place, too, since you earn money for helping other players out, too.  Even still, this is a mean game that's about sticking it to your opponents.

THE BOTTOM LINE: 8.5/10 -- A lot more engaging and nuanced than I first thought from just reading the rules. The fact that you can improve your own lot by helping others is difficult to evaluate... Is earning money for Bill (and getting a piece of the action) better than getting a bit of direct cash and possibly letting him net a huge windfall? For only two turn actions available, there are some really tough choices. And even though there is definitely competitive play here, the fact that you can make positive moves for several people at once helps keep this from feeling confrontational. I highly recommend it, as it's really provides a distinctive gameplay experience. It is well worth tracking down.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Not too sure about this one yet.  My initial impression is that once you're behind, it's pretty much impossible to turn it around, since whether you get customers or not is mostly at the mercy of the other players.  You may be able to move the colors you want onto the fountain closest to you, but there is no guarantee they will be there when it is your turn again.  So the rest of the game is reduced to trying to make money off of their customers, but then the rich becomes richer and the gap between you and them becomes greater.  The real game is in the purchasing of the right stores at the right locations, because that will be the biggest factor in determining whether you get customers for the duration of the play.

After 1 Play: I'd have to play again to get a better sense of the game.

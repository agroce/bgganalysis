RATING: 6.5
This is a well produced game that has a very thematic feel. I've never surfed, but this seems to capture what I imagine. From the little surf boards, to balancing, to catching a perfect wave and hanging ten, this game does it all. It's a bit confusing for some players because of the simultaneous resolution of cards. And it's challenging to keep in mind you are catching a wave *and* trying to stay balanced on the board. The competition is in getting to the waves and pushing your luck with score cards. Over all, pretty fun, but feels repetitive (again, probably much like surfing?).

Parts of this game are beautiful and parts are a little clunky. Balancing your hand while riding waves has a fun risk/reward element. I like the scoring mechanism. But I wasn't a great fan of how the game length worked with a card deck running out and that being the game. It seemed that you didn't get enough rides in for the scoring mechanism (but the game still probably is too long).

I think this is kind of amazing because there are all these elements in a game that I'd dislike, yet because of how well it's ties together with theme and presentation, it's closer to a game I don't mind rather than one I would otherwise avoid like the plague. Press your luck and luck based games just aren't my thing but in this case, hey not so bad.

I backed this on Kickstarter mainly due to the unique theme and mechanics. I am impressed by the quality of the game components and the graphics are top notch. So far I have played one game. Since I had watched several gameplay videos I had a pretty good idea of how the game mechanics worked. However, it took about half of the first game to get into the groove where it all clicked and the game started to flow smoothly. 

The mechanics/theme really do work. You can tell there was a lot of thought put into it and I'm sure a ton of play-testing. Everything made sense based on my limited knowledge of surfing. Looking forward to playing with more than just 2 people to see how that changes the dynamics.

Update: Played a second game, this time with 3 people. I talked my wife into playing with my son and I. She was a little overwhelmed at first, but by the end she was a pro - she ended up winning Grand Champion! I think we found another game she actually wants to play with us!!

Cody does it again with another awesome game!!!

There's so many great things about this game, that I don't even know where to start.

The theme is a rich and fulfilling experience. You can tell the game was built around the theme and not the other way around, like a lot of games now-a-days.

The components are stellar. Especially in the deluxe edition of the game. Everything is just beautiful and really stands out in bright, rich colors and the artwork is very well done as well. Just a beautiful game. Even the rulebook is laid out nicely, as was done in his previous game Xia, with color coordinated boxes separating each section, making it easy to find what your looking for.

Put all that together with the amazing gameplay and WOW! You've got one hell of of a great game. Plus the game can be played solo, which has its own set of rules to go by or you can play up to 6 players. Again, not something that you can do with a lot of games today, which usually limits you to a party game of some sort.

Honestly, I can't say enough to give this game the justice it deserves and I'm so glad that I jumped on the Kickstarter for this one. Ah the Kickstarter, which was also an amazing experience in itself. Cody runs some of the best Kickstarter campaigns that you'll ever see. Constant weekly updates every Friday, which include things such as where the game stands at that point in time, videos of play testing, pictures of everything you could imagine, voting polls on what the backers would prefer or like to see and even maps with where the current boat is at sea during the shipping process. It's an unbelievable and very enjoyable experience.

Many, many thanks to Cody and his awesome family for all of their hard work, time and dedicated commitment to not only the game, but to all of the backers as well. You really couldn't ask for anything better. Keep up the great work my friend, and I'll definitely be looking forward to seeing what games you come up with next.

I have zero interest in surf, but I really appreciate how thematic this game feels. There is quite some randomness in all three types of cards, and they often limit what you can do or add a push-your-luck element, but your decisions still matter. Good fun overall, but it's a bit too long for what it is and can be very frustrating when luck is not on your side.

RATING: 8.5
Very thematic surfing game (not many of those around).
The mechanics are simple and the choice of cards can be a bit obvious sometimes (I can't play this card because it will take me off my surfboard and I will fall in the water).

It does make it very accessible at a gateway game level. Components are top notch and colours just pop. Very glad I have this game. 

Solitaire campaign is fun, if a bit hard, as opponents get very pushy and force you out of waves.

RATING: 8.5
The gameplay in this one really brings out theme: Turn to turn, you're either trying to catch the best wave you can, or trying not to fall off your board. Riding waves is very tactical, with a fun dose of push-your-luck in terms of playing it safe or trying to raise your score for that ride. But then about halfway through the or so you can get a feel for whether you should focus on improving your overall shortboard or your longboard score, coupled with lots of pressure to do so before the game ends. Writing this makes me want to play again right now . . .  my rating may go up.

Collector's Edition:
I honestly skipped right over this game. I thought ehhh surfing who cares. I have never surfed before, I have no interest in the sport. So why even try the game right? WRONG!!! I kind of fell into this one at a convention. Saw some friends playing, they had a spot, so I jumped in. I am so glad that I did! I am a sucker for theme. This has a tremendous amount of just that! Not being a surfer, I cannot say this with 100% certainty, but this game is super engrossing and the theme gives players that sense of "surfing". This is a beautiful production all around. It is a very fun push-your-luck game. I consider it light to medium. Medium due to it being a tad fiddly keeping track of things etc. If you don't like push-your-luck games then you MAY not enjoy this. Although you can play ultra conservative and still be competitive. You aren't forced to push your luck. Unlike some games where that is the core mechanic, and sometimes ONLY mechanic. Some of the negative reviews are from people who pushed it and failed. So obviously that is the games fault??? ...I don't think so. Anyway, exceptional game! Don't make the mistake I almost made, and pass it by just because you don't think the theme interests you. HIGHLY recommended!

I like the scoring system. This game is unlike any other game, and that's a huge plus for me. Once you get the rules ironed out (took about half a game), this goes really fast. It's fun to gamble on big waves, trying to pull of mega tricks for massive scores.

Kowabunga! The surfing theme of Tavarua really shines through in this excellent game of hand management and push your luck. Beautiful quality components, especially the boards, wave tiles, and custom dice immerse you in the surf contest battling your friends for the perfect wave to ride into shore and score big. I would highly recommended the game to any group, especially if you consistently end up with 5 or 6 players for a weeknight light to medium weight session. With learing, 5 played in about two hours, turns going much faster in the second half.

Absolute dreck. I dont know why people rate this one so high. Its an extremely repetitive and frustrating game. You can take several turns doing boring activities just to end up whipping out on the water, essentially wasting several turns with no compensation. On top of that the rulebook is a mess, it is hard to teach even though you dont do much at all during gameplay.

My gaming group always enjoy coming over to play games at my place. However, this game left SUCH a sour note that some of my invitees haven't been too willing to come play boardgames again. Its just SO BAD! For that reason I dont just dislike the game, I DETEST it! I'd burn it with fire but I'm not about to waste lighter fuel on this tripe. 

Dont buy this. Stay away from it.

RATING: 6
It's a nicely captured theme, and that's why you'd play it. There's a series of 6 waves coming in of various values (set by dice), and you can catch a wave when the value of the dice is >= the number of spaces it is away from shore. Each turn it will move closer. Your turn is either to play a card to move out to a spot where you can (or will soon) catch a wave, or once you're on a wave, spend a card to move forward or backwards on your board, knowing that the wave deck will then play a card to also move you forward or backwards (you have some idea, but not perfect), and as long as the movement doesn't send you off the back or front of the board, you score your card and continue your ride next turn. The longer you can stay on, the more you score the wave. Score your best waves using a short board and a long board, best scores win. There's a ton of other thematic rules, like barrels. But it's also a ton of rules that engineer unwavering randomness on top of randomness - the wave values when you're in a position to catch, the cards you get, the wave card flips, the contests to get on a wave - so in the end it feels like the waves have ridden you rather than the other way around. It's an ok ride game, but there's too much randomness to justify this many rules.

Living in California and watching surf competitions at the beach, I have to say that this game feels like the real thing!  The components are stunning, the game plays quickly and there are even solo rules that seem to work!  Maybe it's the excitement of getting a new game but this one really rocks.  I feel like giving it a 10 and I am very picky and facetious with my grades so I'll give it a 9.5 for now!  The ability of this grade to stay this high will depend on the longevity of solo games.  Perhaps we'll even re-create the WSL in the same way that the Rallyman community races the WRC every month?  To do that we'll need to understand how Cody created the solo decks and understand if they can tailored for each region to perhaps model the waves of each locale so each competition has a specific flavor?

RATING: 7
The theme is fantastic; it's obvious the designer knows surfing. As far as game mechanics, it's a push-your-luck game. You can play without taking risks and end up with a modest score but if you want to score highest you'll probably need to take some chances. Having only played one full game I can't say how the odd work out with heavy risk taking but playing it safe brings in a reliable middle score. Strategic planning can boost that a bit too but I think to really dominate you're going to have to take some chances.
So ultimately, the game has a fair degree of chance, but there's solid strategy too and the theme is ultra-strong. Normally not my type of game but I rather enjoyed this one and would play it whenever someone suggested it.

Good little game with a surfing theme that comes through very strongly. The mechanisms are tightly interwoven with what is going on. I have never seen gameplay such as this game tbh, very impressed with the originality. The production is top tier, and I have the collector's ed with the wooden pieces, so even better there. After 2 plays, I feel a little underwhelmed though. I felt like I was pretty much doing the same thing every round. I didn't feel a sense of progression, and the dynamics of the game felt pretty much the same from round to round. I also don't like how the stoke cards work. Stoke tokens are very important in the game so I don't like to spend one to draw a random card that may or may not help me atm. Granted, they are all very powerful one time actions, but still.. would've preferred a different approach, like maybe having one face-up to choose, or draw two keep one sorta deal. I also think the game goes on too long for what it offers. Regardless, I like a lot of things about it, especially the theme and the production. I want to explore it further and see if it wins me over.

This is such a great game! Its fun, thematic, looks beautiful and its so well designed! Im so impressed how all the mechanics in the game works so well together, how you use your cards to paddle out in the water, catching waves, doing tricks and trying to stay on the board. There are so many smart things going on here and they all fit perfect with the theme of surfing! The only negative thing I have to say is that there are many things that you have to go through during a turn and its a lot to remember, but after a couple of plays its no longer a problem. But it can be a bit overwhelming for new players. Great work Cody, love this game!

RATING: 7
I hadn't heard of this game before, so walked into it blind. Immediately I liked that the theme was something I'd never seen before. It's a game about surfing. The game looks nice and has good components, but as it was a kickstarter game I wondered if good components might be the only thing it had going for it.

In the game you're trying to be the best surfer. There's a longboard and shortboard competition. At the end of the game the best longboarder and the best shortboarder will be in contention for the win, with the score they got in the other competition determining who wins. So the best shortboarder will match his longboard score against the best longboarder's shortboard score.

The way the game works is you have a hand of cards showing some sort of surfing trick with a direction and a number 1 through 4. These cards can be used in a number of ways depending on where you place them around your surfboard and whether you've already caught a wave or not. If you aren't on a wave the four card slots let you paddle out, paddle in, wait or catch a wave. If you are on a wave, they let you "ride" the wave, score points, bail or recover from a wipeout.

Paddling in or out just lets you move out to sea or back towards land. there are "wave tokens" that will be moving towards shore each round, and you want to position yourself to catch a wave. Each wave token gets a die on it which is randomly rolled. That wave "breaks" when the die number is on or below the space with the matching number. So a 1 die only breaks 1 space from shore, while a 6 die could break 6 spaces out. You can only catch a wave after it's broken.

Catching a wave puts you onto a wave token, and you then move towards shore with it. However, the card you played has a direction and number and you have to move that many spaces on your board in the appropriate direction. After you resolve that card it gets put into the score pile which will get converted to points later, although not so much if you wipeout. So large number cards are great as you get a better score... except they force you to move on your board a lot. If you ever are forced to move beyond the edge of your surfboard, you wipeout and will have to spend a turn recovering. Similarly, after you've caught a wave, in subsequent turns you'll be able to "ride the wave" by playing a card, which means moving the number of spaces shown on the card in the direction shown on the card (and again risking wipeout).

Riding and catching waves are a little tricker too because every round a wave card will be revealed and you'll have move that many spaces on your board in the appropriate direction... and that's in addition to the movement from your catch or ride card. And this could also wipe you out. You don't know the exact value or direction of the wave, but you can see some information on the back of these cards and have a rough idea how many spaces you might move and the possible direction. There are also "stoke" tokens (that you get when catching a wave, wiping out or getting to shore) that you can play to adjust your catch/ride cards, but that must be done before the wave card is flipped and revealed.

There are some bonuses for catching a wave exactly when it breaks, "hanging ten" on a longboard, riding a wave all the way to shore, and surviving a "barrel roll" wave. If you bail or make it all the way to shore you score points depending on how well you did on your surf. (If you wipeout you get a score but it's not very good.) The points you scored during the surf get converted to a 10 point scale. At game end you'll score your two best attempts at both types of surfboards. The game ends when the wave deck runs out.

The game is interesting. There's a little bit of luck in your card draw and in what order waves come out and whether new waves have a good number or not. Given the game is only about an hour, maybe less, it didn't feel like the luck was inappropriate. There's definitely an opportunity for strategy, and the gameplay was fairly good. I had a lot of fun playing it and really enjoyed the unique theme.

RATING: 5
An ok tactical abstract with fancy mechanics but has an awfully large option tree due to the multiple spatial degrees of freedom. Kind of reminds me of Dungeon Twister. Hard to plan ahead because the board can change very drastically between the turns. I suppose there are not any greater strategic depths to the game, you just seize the opportunities at the very moment they present themselves. Moreover, basically you want to stay close to the corners of the boards so that you can jump across the gaps to two other boards when they drift near to you. This is especially true when it comes to the opening moves. A bad opening can mean that you need two turns to get anywhere. 

I would not mind the limited nuber of ways to play the game if there was one clear winning condition that everyone aims at. However, in Dokmus you are collecting points here and there from reaching certain spaces on the board + some extra points from spreading your influence as wide as possible. 

There is also a feeling at the back of my mind that the special powers are not very balanced. To be more specific, the benefit from moving a board seems very situational. This is because there is only one free space on the table and only half of the boards can be moved into that space. So, the position of half of the boards is locked tight. And if you are not next to this free space, the special power it useless to you. For comparison the board rotating ability can be applied onto any board on the table which makes it useful most of the time.

Was not left with a need to play again. I could but would not suggest myself.

An elegant abstract with surprising depth, not only are you trying to array your tokens on tiles so that they can score the most temples, but you'll also get added bonuses for how many tiles you've placed near temples, and how many tokens you've sacrificed to do so. The Guardian card abilities are simple, but interesting, and giving Dokmus that spatial element of tiles potentially rotating and sliding about the board makes all the difference from a lot of other area control type abstracts. Very cool.

Elementen van KingdomBuilder, maar iedereen heeft dezelfde opdracht.
Heel eenvoudige regels, maar na enkele ronden bijzonder veel mogelijkheden in het spel, dus wel wat denktijd.
Alles staat samengevat op handig kaartje.
Volgens mij te spelen met divers publiek, en daarom ook gekocht.

Dokmus reminds me a lot of Kingdom Builder in that you're playing your buildings to spaces of a board, trying to place them in such a way that gives you good future opportunities. At the end of the game, you'll score points based on adjacency to some key point-scoring spaces of the map.

The twist here is that the tiles that make up the land mass can slide and rotate, which can drastically change what you have access to as things move around. It's pretty fun trying to figure out how to manipulate the map to your advantage.

Overall, the game is very abstract, which is something I don't typically like, but this one felt pretty rewarding as you made progress in spreading your buildings across the map.

A very deep, satisfying experience that is more tactical that strategical, more abstract than spacial. Despite my penchant for a more strategical area control game there is something awe inspiring about this game that make me want to play it many more times and with various types of thinkers. I really like it for being a ten minute "rules to playing" learning curve with seemingly endless re-playability. I can only imagine my score going up in the future.

The box is not much to look at, but what a great game inside!  Players draft a card allowing special movement or first player token for the next round then place tents trying to get adjacency to temples for victory points.  Tiles can be rotated and moved to allow encampments to spread.  Good stuff!

What a unique and thinky abstract! I feel like I get better at this one with every play and I'm really enjoying the discovery of clever plays and the balance between strategy and tactics. One of our newer additions so we have 10 games for a 10x10 hardcore abstract challenge in 2018.

Abstract game with a wizard-temple-theme varnished across. The board consists of 8 squares, each containing a grid showing temples and ruins scattered between plains, forests, mountains and lakes. The 8 squares are in a 3x3 grid with the middle left open at the start of the game. Over 8 rounds the players place 3 huts, after having chosen their starting hut on 1 of the corner squares along the outer rim of the board. They try to score points by placing huts next to temples. Each round they also have to choose a card which determines order of play, as well as a special wizard action (become first player, shift the squares horizontally or vertically, turn a square 90°, move one of your huts at zero movement cost). An extra wizard action and a victory point can be obtained by placing a hut on a ruin.

Like a 3D Pentago - reminded us of Kingdom Builder
Re production, some method -- such as using two layers of cardboard for each tile with cut-outs on the top layer -- might help keep the tents in place.
More fun than expected though we enjoy this type of puzzle-placement challenge.

I can see why people think of "Kingdom Builder" when playing this game, but this one is quite different and to me much better and interesting. The rules are short and easy, but the ability to change the board is what defines the game and that works very well.

Every turn, players draft-and-pass a hand of 5 "guardian" powers that either make you the start player, or allow you to move or rotate board tiles or move a piece already placed. In guardian power order, players each place 3 pieces adjacent to pieces already placed and use their guardian power in any order they choose. After 8 turns players run out of pieces and the game ends. The board tiles feature about 8 different types of terrains and structures that all have different placement rules, some requiring you to sacrifice one of your three pieces to use. The object is to meet various scoring objectives having mostly to do with the temple spaces. You score for temples you are adjacent to, for building adjacent to all temples on a tile, and for being adjacent to a temple on as many tiles as you can. While you move slowly through placement, you really need to manipulate the board to spread your pieces around and build on the edges so that you can jump from one board to another. 

There's a lot of room for creativity in how you place and manipulate the board, but without a lot of distracting special powers and such that are prominent in many modern designs. This is an old school game and it gives me an old school satisfaction. Just be careful as you move the boards around. The game takes on an unintentional dexterity element as you rotate and slide boards with lots of pieces on them. Let the pieces slide off and everybody loses!

The game doesn't take long, but has a very interesting mechanics of always changing map. Although it seems that there are not many tents, by moving and rotating various map pieces the can travel pretty far away. You simply have to not miss an opportunity and not miscalculate where your pieces will end up.

Žaidimas netrunka ilgai, bet turi labai įdomią nuolat besikeičiančios lentos mechaniką. Nors iš pirmo žvilgsnio atrodo, kad ne tiek daug palapinių turi žaidėjai, stumdydami ir sukiodami įvairias žemėlapio dalis jie gali nukeliauti pakankamai toli. Paprasčiausiai reikia nepraleisti progos ir neapsiskaičiuoti, kur tavo figūrėlės atsidurs.

Dokmus is a really interesting consept which I like to play quite often. It seems there are only limited number of strategies to victory which makes tha game a little boring. But with the randomazed board and other factors the chances for victory are usually the same for all the players.

Feels a bit like Kingdom Builder, but is a bit heavier and can cause serious AP, especially on the last round, because you can't necessarily do that much forward planning. Gives you good old school euro vibes.

"Overall, I quite like Dokmus! I think it's about the same as Kingdom Builder, in my mind, as far as "which one would I prefer to play", which is nice. Generally, I'm a fan of these types of games, so having more variety in this space is basically only good for me. It's a neat spin (pun intended) on the genre with the map manipulation abilities, but it also does a decent job of keeping players fairly separated for a while to let them get adjusted to the mechanics (rather than just playing anywhere like Kingdom Builder. It seems pretty easy to pick up, as well, which is always nice, but I don't totally understand the super-thin, insertless box, if I'm being honest. Oh well, either way, if you're looking for another abstract strategy game to round out your collection, I'd recommend checking out Dokmus! It's a lot of fun."

Abstract game with some similarities to Kingdom Builder. People say it is better, though. Maybe very fiddly (rotate tiles and move tiles with pieces over the tiles).

RATING: 7.5
Dokmus has a bit of a similar feeling to Kingdom Builder, each turn you just build three of your pieces next to your existing pieces. But at the beginning of each round you select special powers that can let you move and rotate the map tiles that comprise the game board, and also powers that let you move your pieces around. Surprisingly thinky and is short enough to be considered a filler+ game (a bit beyond filler), at most about an hour even with a full 4 players.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

At first I thought it quite neat...and then I got frustrated when I couldn't manipulate the board as desired and got trapped in a corner. Guess I gotta figure out a better way to play! There are some comparisons to Kingdom Builder but this stands alone. The action tile selection piece that determines your special action and turn order certainly drives the game.

RATING: 8
Feels like a descendant of Kingdom Builder - fairly straightforward abstract game play that has you putting a few of your pieces on a board for scoring opportunities.  Doesn't have scoring cards or special tokens that give you abilities like KB, but instead you'll be trying to reach temples to score points while picking actions cards that give you one time abilities.  The map will vary from game to game since the tiles are double sided and can be manipulated throughout the game, but the scoring is always the same.  So, in my opinion, a little less deep than KB and less variety from game to game.  Still enjoyable to play, if you like puzzling out your moves to score the most points.

This is a nice abstract game of moving across the landscape of 8 square tiles. Every round you choose a special role, that allows you to for instance turn a tile, or move a hut one space. Interesting little game. Points can be earned for having a hut next to temples, a sacrifice place or by spreading out across as many tiles as possible.

It's abstract with a light theme but it works really well. Players, first draft actions then take turns placing their expedition pieces. On your turn you get 3 placemennt points and a free action allowing you to hop over a space, rotate or move a piece of the board. Players are trying to spread their pieces across tiles to get close to temples. There's end-game points for dominating a tile (reaching each temple) and for getting to temples on multiple tiles. You have to figure out how to get around temples, volcanoes and the other player's pieces. It's a cool little 45 minute game.

Better than I expected. Highly tactical placement game. Working out the best ways to score is an interesting puzzle. Probably better with fewer players, as there's quite a bit of chaos in the four-player game. Resonates with Kingdom Builder: if you like that game, I think there's higher than average chance of enjoying Dokmus.

Indifferent.

My favorite of the month. This game is an abstract game with a few moving parts. I suppose it could seem samey after ta few plays but, you could say the same thing for any abstract. This is purely an abstract game and I just love it. Boards rotating and moving and you are trying to optimize your placements and claiming good locations. A game I just want to play over and over.

Comparisons to Kingdom Builder are justified. Abstract settlement building and little player interraction besides the occasional blcoking on the map. This is more to ky taste than most similar games. Dokmus doesn't constrain you with a tangible theme or convoluted rules. It feels almost chess-like in its simplicity, but open to deeper strategy. The rotating and pushing god tile powers let you reshape the entire board and always get everyone's gears turning for their next move.

Solid euro-game with clear rules. Play feels like Kingdom Builder or a bit like a mix of GO, Eight Minute Empires and Lords of Xidit. Recommended.
Upsides: Little randomness past other player action which you should be able to predict. Should. Solid, good quality components. Easy and clear rules. Good re-playability. Balanced scoring and and few different ways to score points, different tactics win different rounds with tight margins (no single clear winning tactic). Plays well with four and two players (haven't played with three) with personal preference for four players.
Downsides: You rotate and move (small distances) tiles that have some wooden playing pieces on them. No problem unless you are a klutz. Rules reference cards use too short sentences to work properly for those who are unfamiliar with the rules and only a single reference card is provided for each supported language.
Other notes: Scoring board is not that mandatory for the points are scored at game end. Plays smoothly but has little theme to it. When mentioned that Volcano in the game should be replaced with desert or swamp (now we have volcano and mountain areas) the designer team replied that different terrain, perhaps including the mentioned ones, appear in later expansions.

Plays best with 4. My rating is for 4 players (would be lower for 2p) I haven't played with 3 players yet but the blocking with 4 players is part of the fun (IMHO).

Abstract area control strategy by snake connecting temple tokens on a shifting and rotating 3x3 square-tiled Rubik like terrain board.

Easily made it to the top of my list. Why? Because it is packed with meaningful, seemingly straightforward decisions. It scales very well and plays slightly different with 2, 3 and 4 players. The overwhelming amount of combinations of board layouts gives it a huge replayability factor. Seriously, it feels like it is a different game each time. Can be taken to a cafe and played on a table. We even tried in a forest on a rock.

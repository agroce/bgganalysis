This gets a generous five, and only because the additional heroes and some of the new cards work quite well if you create a custom Cerberus Deck Building Experience by mixing and matching. Otherwise this is a torrid expansion that was poorly tested, and both the original and Street Fighter versions are superior. Steer clear unless you're a great fan and want to mix and match the games.

After playing the original and seeing this one being played when we stopped by a game store my wife really wanted this game. Already she enjoys it as much as the first version. Soon we will combine the two for an epic game of DC deck building. =)

RATING: 8.5
5-5  in 4 player games

I love this game more than the first blue deck builder because all the matches I've played up to this point have been really close.  Like 10pts between first and last place, another game was 7pts between first and last place.  I don't understand how people have complained about balance issues because in my group, they've all been good games.  With the original deck builder, it was much more common for someone to snowball the match.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
My favorite of the big box additions. I like the heroes, the lattern corps cards, just everything. The only possible issue is that Kyle Reiner can insta win a little too easily if you let someone pull it off.

RATING: 7
Good addition but difficult to mix with base, main deck becomes too big
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Almost exactly the same as the first, but it's to be expected from a generic system. Although people complain that the game is without theme, I'd argue that all of the cards thematically work the way they're suppose to; all of the characters/abilities match each other.

RATING: 9
Much better base game for the DC DBG range than the rest, since these 'Super Heroes' give more variety for players and don't make a player's strategy so obvious (unlike that found with the original base game)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
One of our most commonly played games. Card variety provides enough good combos to keep things interesting and heroes in this base provide more buying options.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.8
More is what I wanted. More is what I got. Some great heroes to expand out the core game, and even better, this one has some of my absolute favorite villains from the DC Universe like Trigon, Talon, Killer Croc, and even Helspont who was acquired with the Wildstorm universe...a great way to further flesh out this fun deckbuilder.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
If you played and enjoyed the original game you will probably enjoy this.
The locations work on a somewhat different mechanism but are much the same, giving a card if they work. The Heroes aren't as simple to play well in my opinion so I'm not sure how well they compare to base game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
A fantastic set with some awesome combos! I really enjoy having the 3 core sets to build my game however I want, and it's hard to pick a favorite, but in terms of sheer gameplay this is probably the standout. A prized addition to my collection, and highly recommended as a fun, easy-to-jump-into romp through the DC universe!

RATING: 5
Sadly, this game mostly plays itself.  There are no meaningful decisions to make.  Just buy the most expensive thing that you can afford.  There is no difference between villains / equipment / super powers.  Everything is simply treated equally.
Also, there is a major rich-get-richer problem. As the super villains are defeated, they bolster the decks of those players already winning.
This box is even worse than the original since it contains lesser known DC characters.

RATING: 6.3
My feeling is that the interactions on the cards in this expansion/game ramp up too quickly, giving you 18 card hands with multiple interactions & it slows the game down.

RATING: 9
This game is playing to my love of all things DCU.  That gets it a few extra points in my book, but love it for the fact that it's a quick and dirty, distilled deck builder.  We do enjoy more complex ones, like Eminent Domain, but when we're hurting in the concentration department, we'll aim for this.  Sure it's light, but when I'm in that kinda gaming mood, it's a perfect score!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Probably one of the easiest deck builders to teach because of the "one currency" on the cards.  Even though this is technically an expansion to the first game, I am hesitant to mix it in with the first game because of the potential of becoming bloated.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I rated this higher simply because it has Nightwing, that being said, same as the first set but less cool villains.

RATING: 9
This offers the same kind of mechanic as Dominium, with a few spicy additions such as 'identity' abilities and intriguing combos. Way way better than I was expecting. Also love the way that add ons like this and others in the range can be played independent of owning the core set. Ace!

This is the same game as DC Deck Building Game. I prefer the original because I like the heroes (who I've heard of and who have better powers) and I like the original locations better. I'll play either, though. I don't suggest mixing them, because it's just too much deck maintenance.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Unnecessary second base set that basically adds a bunch of cards but not much depth. Game still plays as basic and simple as the original.

Can be stand-alone or mixed with original set. 

Adds more heroes, most of them uninteresting.

Mo' Heroes; Mo' Problems.  Adds a few of what some would consider B-list heroes, but adds even more variety in the Main Deck, so for me it's a hit, even if it *is* considered "More of the same".

Inferior to Marvel Legendary in every way

Pros
Simplistic gameplay

Cons
-One currency for all actions...really?
-Attacks are annoying
-Major lack of theme (why are heroes competing to defeat villain?)
-Game effects don't always correlate with comic book personality
-Runaway leader
-Game is too long for what it provides
-Fairly long down time
-Cards come out randomly, hard to formulate long term strategy
-Cards come out randomly and possible to get stuck with all expensive cards early, or bad cards during your turn etc.

While it is a lot like Ascension, I prefer the DC Deck Building game instead. Ascension art is hit or miss with me but overall it is mostly a solitary game. With the DC game you have the standard version or crisis expansion with that and the normal villain/super villain that pop up to add in a light player vs player mechanic to it. Yes it's not perfect for a superhero game, but for an easy to learn deck builder, it's fun enough that you might want to give it a try.

RATING: 6
Man, the DC bench is thin on memorable characters -- once you get past the heavyweights like Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman (all from the first set) you wind up with some real bozos. They likely should have held out Green Lantern or the Flash for this set. Still fun, though. Our games seem to run a little longer with this set, and the incidence of card destruction is higher, requiring different approaches. Glad to have it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A nice expansion that can be played as a core by itself or can be combined with the first dc deck builder. We enjoy this one but the first still shines stronger having the main DC bigs in it but this one balanced better with more female heroes.

RATING: 3
Way broken game.  The original game is a well balanced game where this game I think needs cards taken out of the game, erratas for at least 5 cards and game/card balance on cards of equal value is lost.  Not worth buying.  Play the original.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A slightly more frustrating version of the base game. Relative to the original, it seems to magnify early decisions and lock one player into a spiral of winning (or losing) that becomes difficult to escape. It's pretty routine for the winning margin in a 2-player game to be a lopsided factor of two.

To the extent that they are different, I prefer the original. The heroes in the original are more iconic and have better abilities, and there are fewer gimmicks and trick cards.

Much better than I'd expected. Like the base game, it's not super-thematic (although, there are nice touches like the force field) but gives you a strong feeling of becoming more and more powerful.

The cards here make for some neat combos plus a lot more decision-making in terms of what you buy (sometimes to deny others) as well as what you discard and retrieve, etc.

Probably the easiest, no frills, filler deck builder I know of. Pretty much mechanics of Ascension and Dominon mixed into one. I do like Dominion much better, and Ascension is much better But, for my deck building fix I'll stick with Legendary, Shadowrun Crossfife, or Xenoshyft.

One can argue that Dominion is on that cusp of being filler, since it can play as fast or sometime faster than DC, but the main difference is that Dominion has expanded and in many interesting ways(I won't mention Legendary, because it destroys this game). Seaside and Adventures alone can really change the feel of the game. The problem with Cryptozoic is they expand the game with new base sets that add "small" mechanical changes and more cards. More cards is great, don't get me wrong, but we don't need(or want) to pay extra for more sets of base cards again and again. Just release big box expansions, charge less and I'm sure many will be happy. But I know it's working for them financially cause there is a crowd that will buy it, so what do I know... At least Ascension adds whole new mechanics like Dreamscape, Night and Day cards, Transforming cards etc. 

For those considering, go straight for this set pass on the others, unless you absolutely must have everything for the game. Nothing to write home about, but a decent game in its own regard. Now if Cryptozoic would stop making "base sets" and release better expansions. I'm sure fans are swimming in punch, weakness, kick and vulnerability cards.

I really liked the parent game.  So, this was similarly comfortable for me.

As a stand-alone . . . felt like the heroes may be a bit more balanced than the original game, and there was really good interaction in the line-up cards.  Only downside is that some of the heroes in this version may be a bit obscure to a non DC comic fan.

Also, have discovered that - on average - the super hero powers are weaker than in the base game.  Several of the super heroes that I have seen played may rarely have their power used.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Just a fun variant of the Original. I actually prefer some of the character set here to the original... but unlike the following sets no new focus, theming or mechanics is added here. Basically... more cards, Which is not a bad thing.

DC's second deck builder improves on the first game, with a greater range of powers and avoiding combos that become far more powerful when linked to certain heroes. The downside is that not every hero is the same power (Booster Gold is weak) and the first super villain gives an unfair advantage.

BIG PLUS: more DC!
PLUS: easy to learn, keeps your attention, improves past game
MINUS: imbalance between some heroes, too many Lanterns
BIG MINUS: suggestions for mixing base sets aren't that good

In the DC Comics Deck-Building Game: Heroes Unite, each player takes on the role of a Super Hero such as Shazam!, Hawkman, Red Tornado, Nightwing, Black Canary, Batgirl, or Booster Gold. Your Super Hero has an ability that will guide your strategy throughout the game. Each player starts with his own basic ten-card deck and draws a hand of five cards each turn. Power is the currency you will use to buy new, stronger cards to add to your deck. There are five different types of cards that can be acquired: Villains, Heroes, Equipment, Super Powers, and Locations. Unlock special abilities, like Force Field or the Helmet of Fate, and unleash devastating card combos against your opponents! Craft your hero deck into a well-oiled machine to take on the most vile villains in the DC Universe in your quest for Victory (Points)! Mix the cards from Heroes Unite with the core DC Comics Deck-Building Game set to wage the ultimate showdown!

Simply put, this is a must-have expansion for the DC Deck-Building Game. Yes, this is a stand-alone, but it shines as an add-on to the main game. More heroes, more strategies, and more villains are all welcome additions, but the big thing to me is the expanding DC Universe in the game. The main game focuses a lot on Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman, but this expansion shows that the game will be expanding into the larger DC Universe, as well. I love it!

Cryptozoic definitely stepped up their game with this one!  So many plays you can make in this one it's crazy! You have to try out 2v2s, it's a whole different feel!  
Take it from me, don't listen to these low rated people, strategy is needed in this game, a bunch of replayability if you have the original.
I definitely recommend this game to families, friends, and father's who still have the kid in their hearts (like mine, he loves this game)!

There is really no difference between this game and most of Cryptozoic's other deck building games. This game is the same as Street Fighter and Naruto.  What I mainly dislike is the fact that the game can take many hours to complete just because a super strong boss ended up underneath the starting boss.  I love the theme, since I am a comic nerd. But I feel that the characters' powers don't really add much to the game.  I much prefer Legendary for theme and gameplay or Resident Evil deckbuilding game (a mix of DC and Dominion) over this one.

Much more interesting than the 1st game, love the strange combinations with the rings and many other cards. Although what the heck is the deal with Black Canary? seriously...and how does a a character like nightwing hope to win against her? I'm also tired of the promo crap. none of my LGS's claim to have received their promos from the distributor.

Worse than the base game as this is really nothing more than a lazy imitation of the original with different heroes and villains. 

Yes there is a more central theme here in the form of Power Rings and they serve as a set collection goal of sorts but an expansion should do far more and take the system much further. 

Tripe this one.

IF you liked the original game, this is a nice compliment to that.  However, this is a stand-alone game and doesn't require the original version.  In fact, while this is an expansion, you should really take care when mixing the two sets together to truly take advantage of the benefits of particular cards.  The rules explain these considerations in more detail.  Overall, I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the original game and/or seeking a light card game with a DC comics theme.

Compared to the original DC DBG, the superheroes are more muted and the game plays more evenly overall.  Heroes Unite feels more a nuanced game, and less a comic book romp.

This version feels a lot more balanced than the original.  Also, it's much easier to accumulate power which makes it feel a little more exciting; the game length is faster and the victory point totals are closer.  It's unfortunate that the iconic heroes all ended up in the original game...

Now, I'll start by saying that, at my core, I am a Marvel fanboy. I love DC Vertigo but, other than The Flash, really don't have time for the DC Universe. That said, this game is great. I've played a number of deck builders over the years since Dominion and this is by far my favourite. This version features what some would call b-list DC characters, so it may be less appealing to some people. (Also in the series is the a-list set with Superman, Batman, The Flash, ect., and  A two-player Batman Vs Joker game.) All are great fun but this one is by far my favourite.

A fine enough deckbuilder, reminiscent of Ascension. The DC theme would've carried it the rest of the way if it wasn't so modern. The New 52, Blackest Night, villians so new I'm not even familiar with? It's almost sad how much it misses on hitting my buttons. And this is the second one, so it's got all the 'secondary characters': Starfire, Booster Gold, Black Canary, Batgirl, Nightwing, Hawkman, Red Tornado, Shazam (who is apparently overpowered); why would you choose these characters? If you're going for less known dudes, go all out. 

Would gladly play again with friends, but otherwise, Ascension please.

This is a stand-alone base game for the DC deck-building line of games and while it can be used as an expansion, it does not need the original game to be played. The original has the most well-known Justice League members while Heroes United takes more of the heroes that aren't as well known, although many are recognizable to fans of the cartoons and/or comics (Shazam, Batgirl, Nightwing, Black Canary, etc) and the same goes for its super villains. It is essentially the same game as the original mechanics-wise but there are some new cards with effects but nothing too complicated.

A pretty straight forward deck building game with a DC comics theme.  It is easy and straightforward to play.  But no easy way of thinning out a deck which really hinders the game and causes it to be unnecessarily long.  Art is good and if you like DC comics, you will probably like this game.

This is an awesome expansion...even better than the original because the heroes have MUCH better powers! We haven't mixed the cards yet, but I actually think that will be a great thing as the cards here take a much different approach than the first game, which will make a great mix. (JW)

I think this improves on the original.  If memory serves, the original game was the first version of the Cryptozoic deck builing system they have used for other licenses.  This added additional card types and mechanics that gives you more options during play.  While this can be integrated with the base set, I would prefer to just play it by itself.

It is always nice to have new cards for a great deckbuilding game. Nevertheless, the characters are by far not as awesome as in the original set, and the synergies between cards are difficult to see or dumb. Perphaps these issues will solve playing the game as much as the original one, but so far I'm not as impressed by this expansion as I normally would be.

Good follow up to the base DC comic game. This second set focuses a lot more on attacking. It has some very interesting new powers, and the Power Rings are a nice addition. Once again, balance between the heroes remains an issue, but there are a lot of fun combos. Some of the combos in this version, however, can really stretch out a turn length.

This is an awesome base set.  I had already had a lot of fun playing with the original base set and this topped it off.  It is just as easy to pick up on as the original and slightly more fun in my opinion. The style of play this set provides is very fun and is even better with the crisis 2 expansion pack.  The only complaint I have is there are a few cards that have too low of a cost/too much power. It can get kind of ridiculous how much power you can accumulate at times. Other than that this base set is well worth the investment!

Shazam is the only character that seems broken and we no longer allow as a playable character.  Being able to buy a random card off the main deck can be a gamble but too often then not it nets a card that should not yet be in your deck as you only start with a max of 5 power and you can get a 6 or 8 cost card that can really break your game.

Everything I wrote for [thing=125678][/thing] is valid for this game. The only things that changes in this game is the cards: new equipaments, villains, supervillains, locations and, of course, heroes. In here you don't play with Superman or Batman, but, instead, you get Nightwing, Batgirl, Booster Gold, Hawkman, and others. I do think that, in this implementation, some cards are a little more OP, particularly those that give points in the end game - like the Rings, and cards that give you as many points as you have of different villains and heroes, which can be quite a lot.

So, for the rest, I will just say again what I said about [thing=125678][/thing]:

****************

[thing=142852][/thing] is a light-ish deck building game, in which players embody famous super-heroes, like Batman, Superman, Green Lantern, Cyborg... ok, Cyborg isn't all that well known, but I know who he is just fine.

Anyway, the game uses Power as currency, and has cards for purchase in what the game calls Line Up - five cards that the player can buy, and also two more: Kicks (which, for some reason, are a super-power) and Supervillains. The Line Up works just like the central row in [thing=69789][/thing]: after you buy one or more of the cards in the Line Up, new cards will be open from the main deck for the next player. Not everyone will like this, since, you could have a turn with a good deal of Power, but only average cards to buy, and once you take one or more cards, the next ones to come are great card, which you could have taken, but just can't because they wheren't there when it was your turn. This also makes the game slow down, at least in the first games, because you have to read what the new cards that keep entering the game do.

Another thing that one can have problems with: no thematic link between what you can buy and use to the hero you represent. You can be Green Latern using the Batmobile and Heat Vision. I don't mind this all that much, but it would be nice if the each Superheroe had a deck of their own, and only the said Hero could purchase cards from there (like the way [thing=88408][/thing] has two decks of cards that only you can buy). The main deck, then, would have only generic equipament and powers, but the Heat Vision? Only in Superman's deck. I won't mind that, say, a card named Ring Blast (which would be in Green Lantern's deck) would do exactly the same thing as Heat Vision - the thing would be to have thematic link, not exclusiveness (though, some cards could have/do unique things). Well, I know this won't happen, but I like to dream.

Now, my biggest problem with [thing=142852][/thing] is the way the Supervillains cards work. They are the one of the main way to get big points - think that they are like Province cards in [thing=36218][/thing]. However, in [thing=36218][/thing] there is a huge element of timming: when to stop buying effects and coin cards and when to start to buy victory points cards - because most VPs cards won't do a thing for your deck, no, they will clog your "machine" almost to full stop (if you start to buy then too soon). This is a really nice thing in [thing=36218][/thing]. But, in [thing=142852][/thing], the Supervillains actually are a BIG help to have in your deck - so there isn't a timming here: when you can "beat" a Supervillain, just go for it. Basically, always. This, to me, seems just bad. I would like [u]much[/u] more if the Supervillains, once you put then in your deck, start to wreck things up. The attack they made in the other players when you use them, should be directed only to you - Darkseid would make you destroy two cards in your hand (the Omega Effect is a bitch); the Joker would make you discard cards, otherwise the other players would draw cards; and so on. But they don't work this way - they are, as I said, a big help - some of the best cards in the whole game - so, in this game, the rich become richer, as once a player got the first couple Supervillains, if you aren't in the same pace, you will be left behind, as the big VP card will also allow the player that took them to take more big VPs cards.

Well, with all that said, one could think that I severely disliked [thing=142852][/thing] - but, no, I actually enjoyed it, I just found it lacking in some aspects. It plays somewhat fast, it is really easy to learn (you aren't limited to 1 action and 1 buy in your turn, you can use as many cards as you want and buy as much cards as you can) and the attack cards aren't all that nasty, so this is a friendlier game than even [thing=36218][/thing], that some say is a solitaire multiplayer game. It helps that I'm a big DC fan.

[thing=142852][/thing] is far from perfect, but I sure won't mind playing it again, since it is so simple and once you know what you are doing, it plays fast.

RATING: 8
Second core set to DC Deckbuilding; using the second-tier characters and a bunch of post 2000 villains I don't recognize. In a clever move, it's designed to have it's hero characters take a longer time to get up to "speed" power-wise, and its more dependent on players finding the corresponding cards that match their hero to reach maximum power levels. Just about as good as the original if not for the less iconic characters, and that it MAY be slightly unbalanced for two player sessions. Red Tornado!

Rating after 1 play of a 2 player game.
It was fun. It was chaos. And that with only 2 players.
It took longer than expected, but I loved it.  I can see how with a lot of players/a long map it could get frustrating/incredibly long, but I'd still like to give that a go.

Second game with 7 players.  We didn't finish.  But it was fun.  I realised it probably isn't a good idea to sabotage your robot with a load of red wine. It really doesn't work as well.

Have played quite a lot now and just really think it is a great fun game.  Just played a short, deadly, 6 player game.  Only 2 survived.  Loads of fun.
Upgraded to a 9.

Had a really fun experience with this one at Kristen's 21st birthday / end of the semester party.  It was just the four of us and a lot of rum, but we had a blast.  Somehow I managed to roll straight into a pit my first turn.  Can't wait to play some more.

I don't get all the hype. Makes me feel like a mechanical rat in a maze. I don't like games where players can die early and have to watch the other players finish the game. Someone else here says it well, "too long and too light." Plenty of other games I'd play before this one.

I'm drawn to racing games but there are very few good ones.  Robo Rally is the best racing game I've played, and a great game in general.  Puzzling out the most efficient use of cards while trying to predict where your opponents are going to end up makes for a fun a challenging game.

There is a learning curve regarding being able to visualize where the cards in your hand will land you on the board.  Until you know how to drive your robot it's best if you stick to simple one board tracks.

RATING: 7
Great fun, especially when players are close enough that they influence each other. Occasionally, a player can get off to a fast start (thanks to the luck factor involved) which reduces interactivity, but all of the games I've played have been fairly close at the end, so I'm not sure it's that big of a problem. The game can be extremely frantic, and player elimination can become a problem, so it's probably best to take this game in limited amounts

It's like Logo (that old kid's computer programming language, remember?), only now your turtle is a killer robot, racing towards the final goal.

Fun, and easy to get confused due to turns and board interaction (there are things that turn and move you on the board, as well as other robots that can push you around).

A brilliant streamlined system of programming, and a great race game. I loved my first play and can see the huge variety which is present in the multiple boards and options. I imagine AP could set in with some players and slow the game down, but with the right crowd this game is fantastic.

Lovely game in many ways - actually better with more players. Fun-loving, but not terribly strategic. For a good time, it's good. For a good game it's.... feh. My variant now is to play one card at a time. Sure, it's really easy, but it removes the frustration of this game and still maintains the fun at least for me. Feels more strategic too and substantially less chaotic. Sold it.

Robo Rally is one of those games in which the journey is more important than destination. This is due to the extremely chaotic nature of the game. Your plans are most guaranteed to fail.

But the magic of the game is in failing. It is like throwing things down into a gorge just to see what happens. For non-serious gamers Robo Rally offers great laughs and fun.

Can't really give it a good rating as I've only played one game.  

Interesting premise.  Several programmer friends of mine love the game, and so a friend of a friend brought it out and we finally got to play it.  They said that all programmers love it... but my husband wasn't too thrilled by it.  Sure, you "program" your robot, but the entire game is about spacial awareness.  I'm great at that... my husband, not so much.  

The game would have gone better if all of us had been allowed to read the rules.  Two of the people playing had played it many times before, and three of us (me included) had never played it before.  We would have benefited from having more things explained.  But that is not a failing of the game, so much as a failing of the people we were playing with...

That said, my husband and I didn't do too poorly.  We were playing the "tag the flag" gametype where we had to go from one flag to another, in order from one to three, and the first bot to reach three would win.  Everyone in the game at least made it to the second flag.  Some of us got almost to three.  And again, would have been better if we had known more of the rules.

Hopefully next time (if there is a next time) will be better.

I've yet to play this game sober.  I'm sure it prove more strategic if I were, but drinking just makes this game fun.  Nothing quite like watching your friends twist from side to side in their chair trying to figure out just what the heck their cards are going to do.

A good game but one best enjoyed very infrequently;   you don't want the novelty to wear off.   A few times a year allows you to appreciate the game;  any more than that and I'm afraid it would degenerate into tedium....

This reminds me of a cross between the Hannah Barbara racing cartoon and the movie short circuits Johnny 5. It was the game Richard Garfield was pitching without success when he ended up having to fall back on his backup prototype a little game known as mtg. Robo Rally is about a crazy robot race through a series of modular boards with different kinds of obstacles and environmental conditions in order to be the first bot to take flags in each board in sequential order. The catch is you have to program your bots and then execute the actions in order so this leads to all kinds of crazy shenanigans. Especially when you damage other robots and start locking certain commands into their tableu. Robo rally is a good racing game. As far as race games go, I think it is probably one of the better ones.

This game is far from perfect, but I always have such a good time when I play that I have to assume there is more here than the sum of it's parts. I have played both the old and new version, but the one I own is the new one (which, despite a setback in component quality, is worth owning for the suggested course layouts alone)

(Sold to make room on my shelves.)

A fun game that always gets laughter at the table.  Plays better with more players.  There's a little bit of a problem with runaway leaders, though.  If someone can break away from the pack, they'll have a much easier time for the rest of the game.

Update: I've had to bump this down to a 6 for my group.  The runaway leader is a huge problem with the number of players we are able to bring together.  Maybe if we could get more to the table, it would be harder to break away from the pack.

Lots of chaotic fun....requires a large group that can relax a little.  Also, every turn you are trying to program your robot to react to different board situations.

Every so often a game comes along where I recognize the sheer genius, but it's just not fun.  This is that game.  My head was spinning trying to program the robot, but the lack of necessary cards ruined the game for me - of course, it was probably more like I didn't know how to use them.  Doesn't much matter, the game just wasn't fun - and the robots were horrible - couldn't tell where half of them were facing.

I bought Roborally by chance without knowing anything about it in 1996, an impulse purchase.  I played it a lot during the next two years. It was really different to all my older games and represented a new experience for my friends and me. Fond memories. I felt the same attraction few years later with Settlers of Catan, and then with Puerto Rico and then... Still fun to play, but now I will probably choose a newer (more euro) game.

Can be great fun, but can also be a real mess that goes on forever.  The fact that one fires in the direction one moves means that the game can encourage a kind of turtling (since it's not fun to be in front presenting an undefended back to everyone's guns).  I wonder how the game would go if the default gun position was to the back...

very good simultaneous action game, but it takes a little bit too long for most people.
Some also say that it is too random since you cannot possibly know where others are going to end up. Although I'll admit it is pretty chaotic at times, the same people always win. You simply need to take every other player into account when planning your phase ahead, making this a very strategic game indeed.
My point being; don't let yourself be convinced by those don't like it, 'cause actually it's a gem.

A "not for me" game. I hate it. Watching others for 15 minutes when they try to find the optimal move...which does not exist because of the chaotic nature of the game. For me this is a giant waste of time.

RATING: 2
This game has the distinction of now being my least favorite game with any sort of reputation, bumping Galaxy Trucker out of that position. First off, I'm absolutely horrible at the game - I somehow programmed my robot to jump off the board in the same place twice without having anyone change my direction or interfere with my orders. I just don't seem to be able to wrap my head around the conveyor belt and how it rotates your direction at the corners. I was also the first one to take three lives before anyone took even one. And even with a pity extra life, I was still way out of the running, and still moving away from the target flag. However, I would also say that this game is completely chaotic with no way of really being able to plan where you want to go even if you could properly visualize where you want to go. I'm sure there is a first-run, small time game by some unknown publisher out there that I dislike more than RoboRally, but I just can't think of what that is.

While the concept of the game is interesting the execution during a game can drive me crazy. Keep it short with a few players and it's a fun game.

When I play this, I prefer the variant where you start out with an option card, and get a new one at each checkpoint.

The main problem with this game is that the example set-up in the rules is horribly flawed, leading to lengthy games with a run-away leader problem. But if you don't realize that, and design all your courses that way, the game becomes a lengthy exercise in frustration, ultimately tossed in the closet.

Hopefully, the upcoming reprints will have some sanely-designed sample courses.

Great robot mayhem! You try to plan your way towards the goals, but as the movement cards are turned and the board elements are turning things around you´re carefully programmed robot can wreak havoc on itself and unsuspecting neighbour.

I think I have what is known as the "second" edition.  Pewter bots.  

I LOVE this game.  The programming aspect, dealing with what cards you get, hoping for the best, making the best of a terrible situation, etc. really appeals to me.  The "randomness," player elimination, and the "once you fall behind good luck catching up" factor are big turn-offs for some of my crew, though.  

Whatever.  Just don't fall behind, then.  :)

While this is a pretty fun game (heck we bought all the expainsions) it is not for everyone.  

The most common problem I see is people keeping track of where a move will take them (confusing directions).  

For myself because I have dylexia I am allowed to have a drawn compose so I can keep track of which way I will be facing...

However amoung my gaming friends the words "Cannary row is hard" has become a standard thing to say for anything that is difficult :-)

RATING: 7.5
The game's strength is it's tactical level.  You'll try to use the actions you have available to you to move yourself towards your goal, maybe by riding on a conveyor belt or sitting on a turning platform to save a few actions.  You know which actions are going to execute in which order, so once you have your hand of actions, play is entirely determined by your decisions.

The exception to this, of course, is if one of the other players makes a move that affects your path.  If a bot ends the register (after each robot has executed that order, and after the terrain has triggered) facing another bot, it will be able to attack with a laser.  If a bot runs into another bot, it will be able to push the other bot, potentially throwing off the entire rest of the round for that player.  This is an interesting aspect, and the only thing that stops it from being a pure race, but whether or not you'll be a RoboBully or a RoboVictim comes down to whether you happen to start the round close to another bot (which usually happens incidentally, as "Destroy all other bots" isn't usually the goal), and whether you get closer to the cards you need than they do (which comes down to pure, dumb luck).

Prolly my most favorite game in the universe.  During our after-Thankgiving battles, the sober guy always seems to win!  I'm so dyslexic, if I get in the lead I typically get excited, program the wrong turn, and jump right down a pit or off the board.  Doh!

Update: Played with the 8.5 year old and he loved it. I guess coding is a STEM skill?

RATING: 9
  A great game of planning and programming a robot in a race to checkpoints, the first robot to the last checkpoint wins.

  Each player has 9 cards with move orders on them; Move forward, turn left, turn right, u-turn etc... They then select 5 cards that will be the robots next 5 actions, then watch it play out. Mistakes are made, robots crash and shoot each other, robots end up running around in circles due to a lack of move forward cards or are stuck on conveyer belts. Brilliant, silly fun, do yourself a favour and pick up a copy :D

Great game for those gifted with logic intelligence. Others can have a hard time, especially when they miscalculate.

One of my favorite board games of all time!!! Definitely give the different types of board set-ups and rules a try in the back of the manual (or make up your own!) I love playing this with 4-5 people... more than that can be both hilarious and frustrating. My husband and I will play it by ourselves but often with more than one robot each and/or with funky "house rules." If you play it with the original rules and with just two people it can be boring and one of you can run away with the lead with no catching up.

My wife enjoyed this and the strategy behind figuring out your moves and how other pllayers pre-programmed moves may impact you (as a player you setup/program 5 moves at a time and then act them out).

Bit too random for my liking with too little going on to keep me interested.

RATING: 5
I can see the appeal in some ways, but it's just too chaotic.  It's dumb luck when you come out ahead (no amount of planning can account for your own cards, your opponents' cards, and how all of them are played), and if someone DOES get ahead, there's not usually much anyone else can do about it while they bump around with each other.
Somehow if this were a demolition derby instead of a race, I think I would enjoy it more.

This is a fun game that generates a lot of chaos. It's always fun to watch people's plans foiled unintentionally by others. We've found that instead of moving each bot individually, that it's faster for everyone to move at the same time (unless there is a conflict) for each register phase.

Really fun game. We always have a blast playing it. But it has to be played with more than 4 players, otherwise the robots don't get in each others' ways.

RR is one of the few racing games in which a losing player still has a lot of fun in going through the motions, just watching adversary robots collide or fall off the board.

There's some need of spatial vision capabilities, but nothing excessive. It can be played by anyone.

Interesting at first, but wears out its welcome fast. Frustrating miscalculations and difficulty preparing for what your opponents can possibly do just because there's no way of knowing what cards they have and at what initiative order. Falling through a hole in the map is just brutal.

I recommend not allowing players to power down after taking too much damage. It makes the game more thematic and light-hearted when robots are basically malfunctioning with program cards stuck in place.

the lack of prepainted minis is criminal.  i like the idea of the programming, and the stuck register mechanic is a really funny idea.  shortly into my first game i started playing random cards and found it more fun that actually planning anything, though, and it's not because i'm averse to such things. i kind of had fun, but it was almost in spite of the game, not because of it.  i can't see how this one has any replay once the ultralight novelty wears away.

This game can suffer terribly from Analysis Paralysis.  If the supercomputer is bored, do you really think it will take 5 minutes to plot out and program a robot's movement - incorrectly?  Not likely.  This game really needs a timer on the turns and house rules for incomplete programs (i.e. cards not played in time).  When its fast and furious, the game's underlieing humor emerges and we all enjoy watching Twonky race through the hazards with his 'firiends'.  [GTI Code: TGSD]

For me, this game is about having a lot of fun while my brain gets all twisted around trying to program the movement of my robot.

I think that people definitely have a love/hate relationship with this game.  This is a game for the analytical types.  Programmers will love this game because it's what they do all day long.   If you have the Wizards of the Coast edition You may need a timer to prod the AP types.  Make sure you give this game a couple of tries.  In your first game the chances are that you will be lost and trying to figure out how the game works, and you probably will go down in flames.  Also this game can go slowly if everyone is having problems getting past one tough part of the board.  Also has a tinge of the laugh at your opponents misfortune that you will find in games like Pompeii and Survive!

It might not be the best choice for someone who gets angry when their plans go awry. I basically view this as the gamer's version of a party game. There is an actual game to play, but the value of the game comes primarily from the laughs and the chaos.

Requires superhuman (robot-like!) planning skills. New players are usually taken off-guard by the disparity between light theme and difficult gameplay. But if they're not it's awesome.

This edition is much flimsier that the Wizards one I remember as a kid.

Have 2005 edition. Great game, appeals to my programmer nature. Mainly only ever play the simple map, as we always seems to have people playing it for the first time. Would like to try a more challenging map but if it isn't the first game of the day, every non techy player gets tired to quickly to play this at their best.

Great game - lovely components and superb game play.

Programming your robots from your hand of cards and then watching them get knocked off course by your opponents is hugely entertaining. (It's even better when you do unto your opponents before they do it to you!)

The various expansions add extra hazards to the game.

Great as a two player game but even better with more players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Played several times with various expansions and variant rules. What the game is, and how it feels like, is determined a lot by these, so it's hard to give a rating for just the base game. Love the concept, sometimes love the gameplay, but in the end, I feel there's too few truly meaningful decisions over the course of the average game for this game to really shine. Mostly you're just trying to see the most optimal pattern in your set of cards given your position on the board (which just takes time), hoping you didn't make any mistakes, and only once or twice per game do you get to second guess your opponents. Those are the moments when the game shines, but it's too little for the amount of time a game can take. Gets significantly better with more players, as then there's more chances of more of these moments, and the added chaos makes the game more fun.

A great, fun, and kind of light game that works equally well with few or a lot of players. Good luck finding a copy, though!

If you're one of those people who has to orientate a map to the way you are facing before you can read it, this might not be for you. On the other hand, that could make you the ideal player, for the joy you'll bring to others. I can't recall the last time my family laughed so much when playing a game, mainly at the expense of Mrs Baddice who keeps driving off the map, much to the amusement of the Baddice children.

Update: and naturally I almost immediately have to update this entry to report that in the very next game Mrs Baddice stormed to victory.

Warning:  Do not play this game with more than 6 people -- especially if you have a lot of inexperienced players.  It's too slow and chaotic at that point.

That said, RoboRally is just plain fun.  The mechanics of "programming" your little bot and watching him bash his way through the factory floor feels unique and is totally entertaining.  It's not the most strategic game but it always seems to elicit plenty of laughter and smiles.

Fun game, the only problem is it takes a little too long (usually) for the mood it conveys. Playing RoboRally is fun when you're alert and energetic, less so at 4 in the morning. It also promotes defeatism in anyone trailing too much. It's no fun when two or three players don't even bother to look at their cards. But the zany action and unpredictable excitement make this a winner.

I love this game for evenings with friends who don't game too much.  The timer keeps the slower players from holding everyone up and it always feels like it is your turn.  Lots of laughs, but best with about 6 people, just the right amount of bumping into each other without it being impossible.

Unquestionably my very favourite game. The hilarity in this game, as well as the strategy, is unmatched. This is a game where things are more or less straightforward, save how much will go wrong. However, this is not a game for everyone. It is very much about enjoying it when things go awry; so if you can't laugh at yourself, this game is more likely to cause frustration than be a good time.

This game has great potential.  My problem lies in the run-away leader potential.  If someone breaks away from the pack, they have an easy time staying ahead.  Good course construction can help limit this problem, but doesn't quite solve it for me.  A tad too fiddly, also.

Hilarious if playing with non-gamers who are directionally challenged.  Really fun for the first hour... gets old if the game doesn't end quickly.  If you do plan on playing RoboRally make sure to only use one board and 2 flags.  Otherwise you could be in for a very long, boring evening.  

I have both the Avalon Hill version and the WOTC version with the Armed & Dangerous and Crash & Burn expansions.  I prefer blending the best of both versions.  I'm glad they did away with "virtual" robots.  The starting docks are the way to go. 

RoboRally is more fun for players who design their own courses, tweak the rules, come up with creative variants, and/or customize the components.  I always play with the Dealer Variant.

One play with eight.

Even though it took a little longer than hoped and therefore were not able to completely finish the game I really enjoyed it.  It comes with a timer for a reason...  use it!

Trying to get your robot through a factory with tonnes of pitfalls including lasers, other robots with lasers, black holes of death, automated walkways and spinning thingys.   You lay out your route of five moves and then chaos ensues.  A whole lot of fun as you never really know what is going to happen.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Rules are relatively simple, tricky part is being able to visualize your robot's position after each order, since many locations shift your direction. Game includes various board maps that can be joined for longer games. This game is fun because you roleplay a robot trying to aviod getting killed. Strangely though I have not had any desire to play it after my half a dozen plays... and now I know why! You basically play solitaire, since your oponents actions and your own can be quite chaotic. The board is your real opponent and it can be quite unforgiving. I'll pass...

All right, so I finally learned RR and this is a one-play rating, but the epically long (almost 3 hours!!?) 8-player game I participated in was exhausting...there were several players who got thisclose to winning a couple of times, but they'd get all shot up by lasers and have to power down, or they had the wrong cards, etc, so it dragged on and onnnnnnn.  Talk about overstaying your welcome.  Next time it'll have to be with fewer players.

Decided to upgrade this one from 9 to 10 for the reason that this can be played with almost anyone, anytime.  The flexibility of the game allows pretty simple and quick setups or more complicated and longer setups thereby allowing most anybody's gaming taste to be satisfied!

For once my wife wanted to get a game even more than me!  We both enjoy this game very much.  It can be confusing keeping track of where your robot will be going (hopefully) with your chosen five program cards, but randomness is built in through the simultaneous play anyway.  This is certainly a game to try out and see if it fits your gaming style!

Wizards of the Coast 2nd Edition

All tokens are unpunched.  6 factory floors and 8 zinc robots are in great condition, and all cards are present, unused, pristine, and still in the order they were when packaged.  The flap box holding the programming cards has some creasing, probably due to the deep dishing in the box bottom.  Despite that major creasing and some obvious signs of shelf wear, especially at the corners, there are no split corners.

RATING: 8
It's not too complex and was very easy to get the hang of. Players start each turn with 8 move cards by default. 5 of them are selected in a sequence and places face down. At the beginning of the turn all players reveal their first move card and move accordingly. After each turn where all players have made one move you take in obstacles on the course and deal out damage or do extra moves if required then all players reveal their 2nd card in their sequence and so forth until all 5 cards have been reveal. This can lead to interesting results and it's always humor in seeing your friends end up somewhere totally of course or plain (stupid). The is no permanent death but you will suffer penalties in number of cards you can chose from should your robot be destroyed. There are other ways to be encumbered by penalties aswell and the most common way is if other players are able top aim their laser your way. 

First to go through all the checkpoints on the course will win. The best thing abut it really is when your friends mess up in their move sequence or you end up in a close battle with someone to win.

If you're playing just to have a good time, this game is a lot of fun. If you're playing with people that are trying to over analyze, then not as good (even with the timer). Some of the most fun moments come when you realize that your great plan is about to go horribly wrong.

Avalon Hill version. Not nearly as good as the old WOTC version, but I couldn't get myself to spend over $100 for it online. Favorite board: The Maelstrom, baby!!!! Seriously, how much fun is it watching someone think their moves out (maybe doing some gyrations in their seat), only to have their robot fall into a pit or get shot to bits by lasers. We have a lot of fun with this one.

I now own both the older WotC version and the new AH version.  The AH version component changes are not at all bad---the robots are not as attractive as the original version, but they aren't that bad, and most are not difficult to tell apart, even unpainted.  You want to paint both the old and the new robots, of course.  I actually like the thinner boards of the new version, since this means you can cram more Robofactory third-party boards into the box.

I love the programming mechanic of this game, in combination with all the different interacting elements on the boards.  I wish I had known about and played this game in college---I would have loved it.

Here's hoping they put out an expansion a la Armed & Dangerous for the new version.

The utter randomness of the card dealing mechanic knocks my rating for this game way down. There's always some poor sap who never seems to get any movement cards and some other happy idiot who gets dealt perfect hands and zooms ahead to victory.

Really unique and fun mechanic.  Plays a lot like a wacky party game but still has a lot of strategy.  I think the strategy of collecting lots of options is overpowered but smarter players can overcome this by ganging up on the player exploiting this strategy.  The game scales very well from 3 to 8 players using different sized maps.  You can also easily set how long the game will last which makes it a great game for any occasion and player count.

RoboRally is a race game.  On each turn players program their robot to execute five movement actions.  Each robot then executes the pre-programmed movement actions simultaneously.  As the movement actions are executed the robots interact with each other in unexpected ways that impact the robots program and location on the map.

RoboRally is a truly unique game.  It is a lot of fun to play.  It scales well with a large number of players (very little down time is added with larger groups of people).

I prefer the one map scenarios with fewer objectives (game can be a little long (for what it is) with larger scenarios).

Good fun!

So far, I have only played this twice both times with six people.  We played a single factory floor board with 4 flags each time.  It was a lot of fun and really chaotic.  It's a lot tougher to hit those flags with so many people going for them than I initially thought.  The game ran about two hours each time, and I can see how it could last much longer with more floor boards or people.  All in all it was a lot of fun with a lot of laughs, although I could see how it could possibly drag on.  Everyone seemed to have a good time playing.

I've loved the idea of programmed movement ever since my cousin introduced me to his Big Trak programmable car in the 80s.  I find it cool that you have to think multiple steps in advance where you will be and how you'll want to turn at that moment.  This game delivers that experience to me in board game form.  I also like the somewhat chaotic element added by the board effects, the other robots bumping you, and some other special cards.  All around this seems like a fun game that could possibly go up in rating if I play it more.  The only problem for me is that I actually played Space Alert before this game, and I just like the cooperative aspect and the time-crunch in that game better.  So I can't see Roborally ever reaching my list of favorite games, because it won't measure up to the one that came years later.

This game is amazing. It's heaps of fun, and can be played with 2-8 players with equal levels of success.You can play straight from the book and there's enough scenarios to never get bored, or you can get creative and make them up on the spot. It's got everything I like in a game - fast, only a little downtime between turns, interactive, tactical, and a little bit chaotic. I find the sweet spot is 4 players though.

I wish this game had better components.

May suffer a little from the run-away leader problem, if playing on a map with sufficient "cover."  Maybe play with 4 flags (or flags that criss cross each other) to fix this.  Actually, definitely play with 4 flags, since 3 flags can be too short - if you have to power down, you're losing a lot of time.

After the first player has reached a certain flag, maybe give everyone else Upgrades.  Sort of like in Mario Kart.

It's easy to learn and teach.

This kind of game is right up my alley and I really enjoyed my first few plays of it.  I doubt that I will buy it because I highly doubt that, when I am the person bringing the games, the people I play with will be interested.  So, I'll just play it with others who own it already.  It IS fun if you enjoy the idea of programming something and can deal with the chaos of it not working as planned.

On second thought, this game doesn't seem like it's right up my alley with all of the craziness.  But, I've enjoyed it every time I've played.  It's fun to program your bot and watch the mayhem ensue.  I look forward to playing it more which won't be difficult since I acquired it in a trade.

Roborally is an allegory of techonology: on a theoretical level everything works fine but then, when put into practice, something always goes wrong and nobody - not even its engineer - knows what or why it did for there’s no way to patch it up.

The same happens with Roborally: when the game starts it’s chaos rampant, thus playing may become frustrating very quickly. [i](September 2011).[/i]

[b]Update I[/b] - After trying Roborally in its full splendour (eight players) I had to make up my mind: it’s a hit! Since then, playing this game has been a completely different experience for me: now I can both fully enjoy the game and see what I missed once. 

This is, where all the fun lies: chaos, confusion and heavy interaction among players, which is exactly what I look for in a game. I wonder how I could miss to notice it before.
Thus, rating raised from 5 to 8. [i](June 2012)[/i]

[b]Update II[/b] - I just can’t get Robororally off my mind. I keep playing it over and over, enjoying it more and more: it’s both fun and a sure hit with my friends, even more so when playing with a large group. As a matter of fact I enjoy chaos in a game and Roborally carries out this task excellently, as it keeps everything simple whilst spawning an overwhelming mess on the board.

In my opinion, but one trick is needed to let this game give its best: simply allow any player to activate the hourglass as soon as he feels like during the programming phase. This will make both the cards choosing more agitated and funny events on the board more frequent.

That being stated, this game deserves a full 10, the third time I’ve rated a game so high. [i](January 2013)[/i]

[b]Update III[/b] - Over the years something happened and now Roborally doesn’t shine as much as it did lately: actually, I’m ashamed to say that lately, when offered to play it, I even started skipping it in favor for other games.

Somehow I’m not feeling attracted to playing it anymore, which in October 2017 led me to lower my rating from 10 to 9.

RATING: 7.5
Chaotic past the point of fun. It gets a five only because it's well designed and I may actually give it one more try in a far and distant future.

Rated an 7 for the enjoyable and hectic game play, especially with 4+ players.  Watching everyone try to figure out their moves (usually with grossly dramatic hand gestures) is something to behold, especially when everyone has had a few drinks!

This game is just pure fun. One of the few games that I don't care if I win or lose; it's all about the playing. It's pretty much impossible to plan a strategy, because you're at the mercy of the cards you're dealt. I don't usually like that, but like I said, this game is all about the experience--I just LOVE this game.

Great game for kids to get into. Really helps them with visual and spatial thinking. The difficulty is if you make the rally too hard, ie 4+ flags, people will tend to lose interest, especially if someone is really ahead or someone is constantly drawing turn cards. But if you can avoid that, the game is FUN FUN FUN. The weapons are an added touch to really make people scheme as to how to mess with other players.

RATING: 7
Significantly more fun when you come up with your own rules variant that keeps players all roughly in the same area. Racing from board to board to board results in very low player interaction.

Idea: 4 flag points, one per corner of a single board. First player to end a turn on each flag in any order wins.

Idea: The center 16 squares are the safe zone. Ending your turn outside the safe zone results in two points of damage. Last robot standing wins.

RATING: 8
Fairly light and fun game of robot racing and fighting. The hook is preogramming your 'bots and hoping that they do what you want them to do-- which depends on the vagaries of other players and obstacles on the map. Can be confusing for some players, especially newer gamers, since you have to consider where you want your 'bot to be based on the cards you hold, what other bots are likely to do, and how to overcome obstacles in your way. This can lead to analysis paralysis and can make games last a bit long. The newer edition has a timer (which helps), suggested map layouts (even better), and a starting board that eliminates the old, complex "virtual 'bot" rules. Upgraded for the addition of a timer and suggested map layouts in the latest edition.

Boring, boring, boring.

It seems to be a good game after our partner Suffo's explanations of the rules because the idea is original and looks funny, but some turns later the game started to bore me, every turn it's the same. My girlfriend wanted the game to finish soon and play another thing but the game took around 2 hours... for her was a torture. I didn't like it too.

Never want to play it again, it's not my kind of game.

I really like the idea, but I found it difficult to program my robot's moves.  Just figuring out where my robot would end up was a huge pain, and if something went unexpectedly, then everything was just crushed.

This game to me is worthless. Played it with 2 and 7 players.

7 players: Spend 5 minutes frying your own brain trying to figure out how to move forward with your crappy cards and get irreversably screwed because someone else made a mistake in their calculation.

2 players: Almos nothing happens.

It seems the only kind of interaction possible in this is to REALLY piss someone off mostly by accident.

Use variant rules to shorten game, and give more control.
Players get 1 card more than usual.  All players can do 1 re-compile a turn (Upgrade allows recompile for free).  Fire Control can only disable an upgrade for the remainder of the turn.
Deal 3 upgrades, choose 1, at start of game.
Discard 1/2 (round up) upgrades on death.  If this reduces to zero, then get a new one.

This is one of those games where the fun aspect and the laughs you will have outweigh the need to actually win the game. "All" you have to do is move your robot around a factory over a series of checkpoints, using a series of cards to pre-program movement. BUT you can be shot by other robots, pushed by robots or walls, fall in to pits, get whirled around or moved on conveyor belts, get damanged, lose action card picks, get actions stuck from one round to the next and so on. Great fun!

RATING: 4
I get with this game is trying to be, but it's basic design is fundamentally flawed. Players focus should fundamentally be about tactically navigating the obstacles and other players, and finding delight and horror in the unexpected results of their carefully laid plans--er, programs. It's a great premise.

But instead, because the results of the execution are entirely make or break, and the game is structured with nether wiggle room nor time pressure, players and up having to focus on tediously analyzing every sequence of moves. This is especially glaring when it comes to rotating conveyor belts, since the specific sequence of when you reach a square and when it turns you has such a profound impact. That means that instead of racing across the stage in a state of flow, the game continually grinds to a halt so that players don't experience frustrating, pointless mistakes of anticipating the precise order with which different pressures are applied.

I don't have a clear fix, but if this were my game, I would continue to develop it and experiment with elements of chance and error correction so that there is still depth of tactics and risk of failure, but less danger of being tripped up by an edge case of the order with which events are executed within a turn. I think you should also completely get rid of turning conveyor belts.

I would also do some work to expand the range of boards and scenarios. the very simplest boards would take a group of three players more than an hour of painstaking move execution to get through. Why not have a few radically simple starter boards?

A promising game, just not really a finished one.

So many people I know hate this game and refuse to play it.  As such, it rarely gets played.  I find it best to play this with individuals who just want to have fun and don't need to have an absolute master plan.  Master planners tend to hate the game as someone will inadvertently mess a route up.  Also, the game has a runaway leader problem if too many flags are used.

Keep the flag limit down and keep the board limit down to keep the game from being stale and long.

Works very well with children, they get excited playing and it is great fun.

A chaotic and at times frustrating race game that becomes more frenzied and unpredictable with more players (up to eight). A great beer & pretzels fun-fest not meant to be taken too seriously. Careful planning can be rewarded but only if you get the right cards to implement your ideas and you manage to avoid bumping into the other 'bots arcing about the board. If it is going to bother you to see your little 'bot carried (or pushed) off the board to its doom while you watch helplessly, then you should play something else...

Also there are a few people in the world (particularly women?) hard-wired to REALLY HATE this game.

This game is pure Chaos, but fun.

Take your charming little bot and turn him loose into a warehouse from hell.  You get to help him stumble through all sorts of dangerous conveyors and obstacles to be the first to dock at 3 different stations.  If you plan better than the others you win, if not you end up with a whimpering pile of bolts on your hand.

This game i beleive should be played with a one minute hour glass to add intensity and excitement.  If not a person slow at reading his card options will make this game dull.

A great game for people that have a sense of humor and can et into an industrial theme.

It's not easy to do the right moves.
Maybe not for players that doesn't like stressful situation.

Because of the modular boards, this game has quite a bit of replayability. Even though it is super-light, some of the funniest board gaming moments I have ever experienced have occurred in this game. The satisfaction of pushing a robot one step off-course, and then watching it accidentally plummet to its doom is satisfying! It's a special kind of joy that you can only really get from Roborally.

VERDICT:

Regardless of my numerical score for this game, if you don't own it, you need to. It's the perfect game for when you have a large-ish group that just wants to go nuts for a game or two. It gets old because of a lack of depth, but it's hard to not come back to the fields of robot destruction, time and time again.

Initially fun to play, especially when the challenged players cant keep their bots programmed properly. I will never play this again after I lost a game when I was about 20 spaces ahead due to the fact I could not pull a rotate right card for 3 turns on a 9 card hand!! The luck factor is annoying and once the competitors get spaced out and if you get left with a vegetable robot in last place with a 4 card hand there is no fun to be had other than avoiding the stompers for the next tedious hour until the winner crosses the line. Another game where you have no control over your destiny and a carefully planned turn can leave you a wreck if someone else accidentaly bumps you or something.

This game is so much fun to play: it's almost as much fun to win as it is to lose, or to make another player lose (accidentally or on purpose *evil grin*).

And while it's great to play just for the experience, it's also possible to play skillfully. Think about the possible moves of the other robots when planning your move, and you will get pushed and shot much less than other robots. Take advantage of the board and always plan one turn ahead, considering the possibility of drawing a hand with limited options (e.g. no turns) and then the game won't be as luck-based as it might seem at first.

I have fond memories of the delightful chaos of the original Robo-rally, but haven't had a chance to play the newest version yet.  I have faith, though, that it'll be just as fun (and chaotic) as I remember it.

Update: it is.  Player elimination can be a little off-putting, but the game is still fun and chaotic.  The "take-that" feeling that comes from reaching for the timer is pretty grand, too.

Only played once. Chaotic race game with robots, lasers and conveyor belts. Each turn you plan your next five moves. But if you get it wrong or someone pushes you off course anything can happen. As your robot becomes more damaged you get fewer cards to choose from making your moves harder to do, and eventually your final moves become locked in until you shutdown for a turn (and leave yourself at the mercy of the other players) or die. Great fun. Probably insane fun while drunk.

RATING: 10
This is an EXCELLENT game. However, if you lack good visual-spacial skill, you'll fail miserably and find the game frustrating. You have to be able to visualize how a 5-step plan will play out on a board that can alter your course, speed you up, shoot you with lasers, or simply kill you in various ways. If you have a hard time being able to think of where your robot will be if it 1. turns left, 2. goes forward 3 spaces, 3. goes back 1 space, 4. does a u-turn, and 5. turns left AND take into account how the board will move, shoot, crush, push, etc your robot than the game is hard and can be frustrating and feel futile. If that's something you can do, then the game is awesome. Take the tactic of kill all other robots or race to hit each flag in order. Use your special powers to save yourself or squash your rivals. You can decide how hard and how long the game is by choosing boards with more or less ways to destroy and move you and choose how many flags your robot has to touch to win this relay race. 

This game works for competitive and non-competitive people. You can play it like a demolition derby or you can play it more like simultaneous solitaire. The goal is simple. The basic rules are simple. It's good for serious gamers and new gamers (although I recommend staying away from boards with nuclear waste and more complex boards for newbies). The old version has better pieces, but the new version has a better set up for player areas and nicer cards. We use a combo of parts from the older editions and the new edition.

The Avalon Hill edition surely enhances the original game; but my opinion hasn't changed so much. I think it's often boring, sometimes frustating, with very few funny moments during the whole game. Special cards, which could spice up the game, are really a fraud: you lose turns in getting them and many are rather weak

I can see why this game is something of a modern classic, but more recent programming games (I'm looking at you, Colt Express) have better pacing, are more visually digestible, and in general provide more sense of agency for the players. Robo Rally supplies an alternation of frantic planning and complicated but fatalistic, unforgiving execution.

I only have two issues with this game:

1. The player tokens are really difficult to tell apart.

Other than that, one of my favorite games.

The robots move along the inside walls of the cube, wrapping around from board to board.  The problem is trying to find other players willing to play due to the length of time the game takes, "cubed" version or not...

You need at least 3 players to appreciate the chaotic hilarity of this quirky, ridiculous game. I can understand why people don't like the inherent unpredictability of the cards and your opponents' actions, though with a little imagination you can try to predict their moves (and possibly outsmart them in the process). With the right group and the right attitude—understanding that you'll probably lose for no reason—this is a pretty fun game. It's not good with two players, though.

The first game I played 2-person with my 10yr. old. He caught on to the gameplay immediately and it ended up being a very close game. We've played with 7 people, one board and 3 flags. Very fun (mayhem). The ages of the players ran from 44 down to 10 with two Moms in the mix. Everyone agreed that it was fun and "most" wanted to play again.

After reading so many negative reviews I hesitated on picking up this one......Then after hearing a relative rave about it I ended up adding this one to my collection and I have to say that if you make sure the course is not too long and you have players that can do their movements quickly, it is a blast. The true gold in RoboRally are those moments when things don't go as planned. Like having your robot pushed by another, sending you off your course of programmed movements and then ending up stuck on a cog that rotates you 90 degrees and your next programmed card sends you into a wall of lasers or worse a pit of death. Funny when it happens to you. Absolutely hilarious when it happens to someone else!

RATING: 6
A pretty fun programming game, where players program their robots to do stuff based on their hand of cards each turn, and then run them to see what happens!  The goal is to race your robot around the board to several checkpoints, doing so before the other players.

Of course, there are a lot of tricks to prevent you from doing this very efficiently.  You might end up on conveyer belts, getting spun around by gears, and even pushed around and shot by other players.  Even the hand you are dealt sometimes will severely limit your ability to do anything productive for a turn.  All of these things severely mess with your plans, so often a winning player is the one who has the least amount of unfortunate stuff happen to them!

The only drawback is that the game can run pretty long and overstay it's welcome if you build too large of a course.  There is also an awful lot of fiddliness in constantly shuffling and dealing cards. I stick with the medium length examples in the rulebook, which seem just about right to me.  Anything longer, and it starts to get a bit old.

I've just taken this one down from 10 to 9, because it's too hard to find a group that loves it as much as I do, so it rarely gets played--and with the wrong group it bogs down. But I still love it. I'll play this any time, and I'm hoping for that perfect group that will want to play it frequently and will play it with verve and speed. Sheer genius. The simultaneous movement, the theme, the turn length limiting sand timer, the chaos factor, the graphics and components--it all pushes my buttons.

RATING: 7
A RoboRally game can be very exciting or very disappointing/boring, depending on how the course is set. (See my personal tips below.) Furthermore I do not recommend the original rules, since even slightly damaged Robots are at such a large disadvantage that there is a runaway-leader problem. I also do not like full player elimination. See my House Rules below. Send me a PM if you like to discuss them. 

DRAWBACKS:
The basic game rules take a long time to explain and digest, but can be remembered easily enough. There is also a significant luck factor.

GOOD: Fast, competitive and fun-chaotic gameplay. 

STANDARD HOUSE-ROULES:
*Damage chits _either_ reduce available hand cards (up to four) _xor_ jam program cards (up to five) _xor_ disable/explode option cards. Usually the damaged player may decide damage placement. Damaged robots are thus more controllable and much more challenging, reducing the need for boring power-downs.
*Repair stations can be used on any phase, but never twice per round. Reduce risk of runaway for the leading player, keeping the game interesting. 
*The course must always cross itself multiple time, for example all even numbered flags on side and all uneven flags on the opposite side of the board. Try to use as few boards as possible.

RATING: 8
There is a real sense of accomplishment when you manage to get your robot where you intended considering the constraints of our hand, the environment, and the chaos of the other robots.

Unfortunately, I have trouble getting the game to the table. I think part of the problem is that people find there are too many factors in play to consider and so they make errors. Making errors isn't fun. Having to try to visualize what happens after you end your turn on the spinning things isn't something a lot of people want to do a second time. And even if I don't find it necessarily difficult, I admit it isn't what I enjoy about the game. I enjoy the unintended consequences of the human interaction, not so much the interactions with the board itself.

This is pretty much a love it or hate it game. As for me: the more I play this, the more I dislike it. 70% of the game is desperately hoping you get the right cards. The emphasis on luck means the game can run for far too long and has players getting severely punished for things completely out of their control. Tends to have a pretty big runaway leader problem as well. Fun for those who crave chaos, very frustrating for anyone else. RAMBots is superior (and cheaper.)

I tend to find extended games of RoboRally a bit tedious so we usually play with a max of two boards and three flags.  We often tweak the upgrade rules too so that they get used a little more.

RoboRally can be a bit frustrating to play unless it is with experienced players.  Many new players find it a bit of a headache trying to work out moves.  Once players grasp that, then it becomes a lot more fun.

EDIT: Having played this much more this has become a game that gets played at the majority of my gaming get-togethers.  I strongly suggest that the first player finished programming his robot sets the timer, leaving the other players with a set time to finish programming.  This increases the tension and speed of the game significantly.

If the game was only robot vs. robot vs. robot and you tried to win the race while impeding and damaging your opponents, then this game would be fun.

8.6:  New edition.  Yes, I know the board is more flimsy, but it serves its purpose just fine.  The inclusion of the timer (in the way it's used) and the preapproved courses book is fantastic.  The flags are better and the new player sheets make everything easier to grasp.  The games are faster paced now and just more fun.  Excellent.

7.4:  Brain-burning.  If you really feel the need to give another player a hard time, you end up playing paper, rock, scissors.  Better to just make the best play you can.  I didn't really feel the game was as much a race, as it was a personal triumph to have a complete turn go your way.  I like having to think this much though.  I think the important part is to set the game up so that you create something competitive.  I didn't have such luck my first play.

I’m glad I finally got to play Roborally! It’s yet a “classic” game that you just need to have played at least once. I have now played it exactly once, and while I would like to play it again I don’t think I’m going to request it all the time, and I’m a bit sad that I wanted to like it more than I actually do. The biggest reason for this is simply that Roborally takes too long to play. 1½ hours is just too long compared to the amount of fun I get out of playing it. Yes, it’s great fun to play when your robots bump into each other and your best laid plans get destroyed because of the other players – but it’s not hilariously fun over 90+ minutes (but then again, which game is).

My other complaint about the game is that once one or two players get a lead, they have it relatively easy as they’re not constantly bumped into, so they get an easier time trying to reach a new flag etc. Mind you, I’ve only played once with 7 players, so I don’t know how it would work on a different map with fewer players, but I think it would only enhance the problem. However, the problem can be mitigated by for instance placing flag 1 and 3 close to each other and flag 2 and 4 the same in the other corner of the board or something like that; that way the robots should constantly crash into each other, so that’s what I’m planning to do in my next play.

Finally, my third and final complaint is that the card drawing is pretty random (obviously), and you can really be screwed over because of this. I don’t know what the card distribution in the game is, but I know that in our game I got quite a lot of turns and only 1 move forward in the very first turn. And in another turn I needed 1 turn left but only got forward moves and a couple of rights… I do know that the game should be taken lightly as it’s a great deal of fun, but it’s still a little annoying that the cards – and not just the other players! – can screw you over.

Anyway, having said this, I still liked Roborally quite a bit! I am definitely willing to play it a lot more, but I do think it requires at least 6 players in order to maximize the chaos and fun, and I’m rarely playing with that many players. Furthermore, as stated above I think there are a few issues of which the length of the gameplay is my biggest concern. It’s funny – and frustrating in a good way! – when your carefully laid out plans get ruined because your opponent just moved his robot into yours, pushing you that one damn space away which absolutely smashes your next 5 moves; but that’s just part of the fun!

Even with a fairly minimal board setup, this game had a bad runaway leader problem.  And the programming phase took too long to see your plans devastated on turn 1 because you didn't anticipate somebody else's off-the-wall move.  I guess I think it's too chaotic for the level of effort required.

My criterion for rating games



http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/147053/item/2300390#item2300390


1) Sense of wonder: This game feels very samey from game to game except that the unknown chaos that comes from the other player's decisions. You will never know where your robots will end up.

2) Meaningful/fun decisions.  This game has only really a few decisions to make; what cards to play in what order. However, your decisions will be wrecked by your opponents and as you lose health you lose options. Less options as you go along in the game.

3) Player interaction: Tons of interaction in this game. This is the strong point of this game. You are guaranteed to get bumped and shot by your opponents and returning the favor.

4) Components/artwork:  Great miniatures and the boards look great. Very evocative of the theme.

5) Game length/complexity:  The game lasts too long if you have more than about 3 players. The more players you have the more chaos and as one player gets close to winning the others will gang up on you and kill you thus slowing the game to a crawl at times.


Bottom line: This is a chaotic fun game to play with 3-4 players. Any more and it lasts too long. But it can be fun for a group of gamers that are not too serious about their games and don't mind losing to the blind luck of getting bumped onto a conveyor!

RATING: 7.5
I admit I may have some bias since I am a computer science/robotics master's student in university, but I really, really enjoy this game.  It's always a hit at department board game nights.

Players "program" their robots to drive around a death-trap of a factory by playing instruction cards from their hand.  Naturally the robots all have lasers (and other upgrades) so even if you can't reach the objectives yourself you can at least try to prevent your opponents from doing so!

One of the best mechanics is the minute-timer; if one player is taking too long to decide on their actions you stick the timer on them.  Once the time runs out you take their remaining cards, shuffle them, and randomly fill in their remaining instructions.  It keeps the game moving, and hilarity usually ensues!

My first game was with 7 players, and it was rather fun (the chaotic nature of the game lends itslef naturally to that).  I would like to play with 4 players, and see if I can't find that "sweet-spot" to determine the "bestest" number of total players.  I am guessing it would be six, adn I want to find out.

What makes Roborally fun is the chaos.  The more players the better.  Try to set up flags in a pattern that encourages backtracking because there is a runaway leader problem to this game.  Also, the game length increases significantly with the number of flags.

Would love the newer version with plastic bots.

I like RoboRally quite a bit; the "programming" is fun, seeing how rounds turn out can be hilarious, and there are plenty of different maps to increase replay value. While it doesn't bother me, the biggest complaint I hear is that games can occasionally be overlong, especially if there are several new people playing. I feel like this could easily be addressed with some sort of timer; I'll have to try it.

If only there were RotateAndMove1(2) cards, I think I would give this game a 7 or an 8, but it just takes forever to get anywhere.  I also got frustrated with crippling bad hands (all rotates anyone?). Either way, I wouldn't mind playing again. --Update: this game is so much better with 4 players and a smaller board.  Increased rating based on shorter more suitable play length.

A great game, but a VERY long game.  If you don't put a timer on the "setup" portion of each turn it gets ridiculus.  Regardless expect the game to take two to four hours to complete depending on how many flags you put out.  The expansions are neat, but just add complication to an already complex game.

An evergreen of fun. Due to the modular gameboard every game can be custumized to meet the needs of the group.
Go for a fast chaotic race on one or two boards or make a long race and use all the boards and flags. The mechanics are easy to learn, so every type of group can enjoy.
The upgrades, so called optinss, are fun and versatile. Play the standard race, or make it a death match, or team death match or capture the flag or what ever other variant that comes to your mind.

5 plays (2p, 2x3p, 5p, 6p)--fun! Mostly played on 1 board, 3 signposts. That even worked well with 5p and 6p for short games. Played twice with 2 boards (3p) and that was good too (maybe 1 hr of play each). Like many games, I think this succeeds as long as the game time is not long. This is an achievable goal here.

RATING: 7
The chaos that ensues when playing this game with a group really makes the game. When everyone is trying to get to the same space and you keep pushing people around there is no telling where your robot is going to land.  Plus we find the theme amusing.


This game can go on for hours but if the lightning ball special rule is added, it makes the game more and more chaotic.  It needs the right group of people.

The game is so random at times that there is almost no point in planning your moves.  It can also have major 'run-away leader' syndrome.  But if you take it for what it is, it can be fun. (There are times when it seems like we laughed the entire game.)  Works well with people who don't have to be in control every turn and who don't want to play anything serious.

We add a house rule where each time your robot is destroyed, you come back with an additional upgrade card (for game balance and interest).  Also, this game works best if there is lots of overlap in the legs of the race (each flag) to increase the amount of bumping into each other.

Three robots (four at most) seems to be ideal for this game, and more than four is too chaotic and eats away at solid planning.  That said, the little chaos in a three robot session pushes this game to the top of my preferences.  The large number of courses and scenarios provided will keep this game fresh and versatile for many years.  Beautiful components and simple rules contribute to this game's greatness.

One of my early hobby game purchases.  I picked this up around 1999 or so.  I wish I'd had the foresight to grab the expansions at the time.
The "runaway leader" problem hurts this game, but it's still a lot of fun to play.  I think it needs to get some more table time with my groups.

A great game. Good for kids and adults alike. My only problem with the game can be that the playing time can drag out longer than it really needs to sometimes.

RATING: 7
This is a pretty fun game. It does have a runaway leader issue and there ends up being a lot less chaotic interaction than expected, especially if you end up out in front. I think this game could be improved by making the checkpoints double back on each other to cause the lead robots to come into contact with the tailenders and encourage a little healthy leader bashing (it is needed in this game since it is like a formula 1 race without needing pitstops and without catching up to backmarkers otherwise.)

2nd game rating upped from 7 to 8. More diffiult maps rule out run away leader problems for the most part. I managed to avoid losing any "lives" but at the expense of taking my eyes off th main goal. I ran three quarters of the way around the board and powered down once keeping my robot in one piece when I should have let it die and gone after the next checkpoint.
I introduced my wife to this and though she was initially frustrated she got the hang of it quickly and soon kicked my butt and Aaron's butt. The remote control was used to great effect to kill me twice and Aaron once. Kami ended up winning with at least two lives in hand. She had also been leading the race for the flags most of the time until I passed her but got nailed so close to finished when I got cards that allowed me to go over the final checkpoint but not stop on it.
It was a fitting end to the game when Kami sent me to my doom despite being half locked up.
4th game 2 players is too few. Funny how long it takes to get to some flags then zoom you finish the other flags in no time.

Very fun and funny game.
This game needs to be played by people who are willing to go quickly. Otherwise it can be to long. A recent game felt like it was dragging a bit with 7 players. maybe a 1 minute timer should be used for every turn.
Rating wavers based on being long and slow or having runaway leader sometimes and being hilarious fun at other times.

I would like to start a local race season with money earned based on performance to be spent on upgrades or fix ups for future races.

Lachlan was surprising good at figuring out the moves in his first game and beat me with a little help.

Love this game - the more players the better. Have played this with gamers and non-gamers and it works well in either group.

The game is at its best when you and/or your opponents are *not* playing at optimal levels, or at the very least, are clustered together on the board and at a much greater risk of bumping into each other, which inevitably throws off the rest of the program...  Recommend using the egg timer to put the pressure on the better players around the table, but let the young or the new have more time to work out their options.

3 órás, 8 fős játék után azt mondom: nagyon jól indult, nagyon nagy reményekkel vágtam neki és hatalmas csalódás lett belőle. Az első 30-40 perc izgalmas, vicces. Még mindenkinek van 7-9 kártyája, még mindenki nagyjából egy helyen van, ha valaki "meghal", visszatérve nem érzi azt, hogy annyira le lenne maradva. Ha még ugyanennyit játszva véget ért volna (bár így is nagyon rosszul álltam), akár 2-3 ponttal is többet kapott volna. Ehelyett a következő 2 óra azzal telt, hogy egymásra vártunk, nehézkes volt a játék, aki meghalt nagyon messze a többiektől éledt újra. Óriásian befolyásolta a játék kimenetelét a kézben lévő lapok...

Ami a legnagyobb hibája a játéknak: nincs eldöntve, hogy partijáték, aminek izgalmasnak, szórakoztatónak és gyorsnak kellene lenni, vagy inkább stratégia játék, aminél fontos szerepet játszik, hogy mit lépnek a többiek, de ha jó játékos vagy, meg tudod nyerni. Nos ezek semelyike nem illik a RoboRallyra. A kártyák szerencsefaktora hatalmas, akár köröket kihagysz rossz kártyákkal, sőt sok esetben "öngyilkosságot" követsz el velük... Ha ki akarsz kerülni a rossz helyzetből sokat kell agyalnod rajta, hogy milyen sorrendben játszd ki a kártyákat, ami alatt a többiek csak várakoznak, és zavaró, hogy mindenki rám vár, dehát mit tudok tenni, ha nem jó sorrendet állítok fel, kiesek, meghalok...Amennyiben 1 órás lenne, ezeket a hátrányokat elnézném neki, sőt élvezném is, de 3-4 órát (3 óra volt az elsőből a 2. pontba eljutnia az első játékosnak!!!!) rászánni egy ilyen szerencsefüggő játékra, nagyon sajnálok... 

A hangulat, a robotfigurák, a viszonylag hamar elsajátítható szabályok előnyére válnak a játéknak, de ennyi.

Though there is no denying this is a fun classic game, I was very, very dissapionted with the quality of the components.

This is a light fun game for me. It takes some forthought  and strategy as well as a bit of guessing what others might do. An enjoyable gaming experience. I now have the original.  Entertaining, but by no means awe inspiring game play.

Just when you think you've set out the perfect plan either somebody bumps you or you forgot about that darn gear that would spin you around and send you in another direction...  Great fun and good for a lot of laughs!  My son and husband both love this game.  For kids, I think it's best to play with 2 or 3 players to limit the chaos and destruction -- at least until they get used to the flow of the game.

Solid family fun as long as you don't mind your pre planning getting messed up by other players.  Playable and winnable by a 7 yr old.  Give the little ones a bit more time and tell them to stand the way the robot is facing and they will pick up on it quicker than you think.

What a depressing pile of crap. Clearly intended for the same people who manage to derive enjoyment from playing the same boring and mindless game for hours and hours and hours and then some more. (Think Risk or The Great Dalmuti with house victory rules.) Chaotic, random, annoying. If you're ever forced to play this title, make sure to commit suicide ASAP to get the point across to the others. 

Why a 1? Because there truly is no point to this game. There is no way you can think of clever tactics or strategies, this is just meaningless card drafting, organising them, and then watching your robot crash and burn thanks to the actions of other players.

I actually liked this more my first play. I think that the second was ruined by the option card "Mechanical Arm" or some such.  After that it didn't really seem like a challenge.  But I expect that the more I play it the more I will like it as the planning stage is fun.  Definatly something to be played by 4+ people in my book.

This is one of those games that I don't think is a great game mechanically, but is just oodles of fun to play.  It tends to be a love-it-or-hate-it kind of a game (generally depending on whether people can visualize their moves easily).  We always play with the house rule that you get 3 option cards to begin with and get to pick one to keep.  I do think it tends to be a game that runs long and can have a runaway leader problem, but robots battling to the death (and sometimes accidentally driving themselves into pits) is well worth playing, despite any flaws in the design.

I found Space Alert to be too stressful and chaotic for my tastes, so RoboRally came as a pleasant surprise.  They are clearly very similar - plot out your actions ahead of time and then sit back and see what happens.  You negotiate your robot through a maze trying to hit certain checkpoints in order.  All the while you dodge various dangers and other players' robots.

A low-stress puzzle game that's random but fun.

This was one of the funnest games I've played in a long time.  There is something quite amusing about programming your robot, and then forgetting about a gear or having someone push you, and then end up walking back and forth through a laser or bumping against a wall over and over.  One of the few games I can lose at, and yet still have a blast.  Note: This game does not usually go over well with the ladies. My girlfriend hates it.
UPDATE: I lowered my rating to 8 because the game does get a little old after a while, and it's hard to find the right group to play it. But is still fun from time to time.

Fairly fun party game. Once someone takes the lead, they tend to run away with it for the rest of the game. For me, treating it as a party game, this doesn't kill the fun of navigating the map as long as course is short, but others may find this objectionable. 

The one problem I have with RoboRally is the constant shuffling and dealing of cards. This doesn't normally bother me in a card game like Hearts, so I'm not sure why it does in RoboRally: perhaps it's the frequency, perhaps it's due to having to work around the huge player mats and course boards, or perhaps it's the feeling that the shuffling and dealing is repeatedly interrupting a single continuous race, whereas in Hearts it punctuates distinct rounds.

RATING: 10
Roborally is not a game involving precise control over your destiny. It is a game about laughing when things go horribly, painfully awry - perhaps to you, perhaps to others. Schadenfreude + Masochism.

On simple boards, getting where you're going is more about the luck of the draw than skill - though you can usually take potshots at those ahead of you. On complex boards, skill is [b]much[/b] more relevant, to the point where planning turns becomes rather brutal for players who are inexperienced or don't have a head for the sort of spatial planning the game requires.

This game's fun per unit time increases notably if you cap turn programming; we use 60 seconds normally, or 30 seconds for a speed game. You get many more turns in, there's less downtime, and many more mistakes are made, all of which are positives for this game.

Production: Fairly functional board, though the numbers on the crushers and pushers are difficult to read, and conveyor arrows can be obscured by the robot pawns.  Play: My one, five-player game lasted too long for the interest it provided.  I enjoyed plotting out my course, but disenjoyed having to do it in my head, rather than actually simulating it on the board.  (1+0+1) (1 play)

RATING: 7
This is a great game where you program your robots and then see where they go. A lot of people have a hard time figuring out right and left from their robots perspective, but once you get the hang of it, the game is great. It's also important to play with a small criss-crossed track so that one person doesn't get to far ahead or behind and get left out of the interaction.

RATING: 9
Wonderful chaos!
I never get sick of this fantastic random chaos. The more players the better. 
Best to start with small games of no more than 3 flags on one board and build from there until you know the rough game time. 
Can occasionally blow out into mega games of attrition.

Watch for the great new player dance as they turn themselves physically to replicate their planned robot's turns ;)

Absolutely ridiculous (in a good way). I'm not sure how lengthy of a game I'd be willing to sit through, however.

I should add that every time we play this, we modify the rules a bit: you flip the hourglass the moment the first person has locked in their choices. Stemmed from a misreading of the rules, but makes for a more frantic game.

Love the concept, design, and humor of this game. The chaos doesn't bother me and I rather enjoy watching it befall everyone, with the preplanned moves going completely awry and no way to change them. It's prone to bog down at times. If done briskly, most often a fun time.

RATING: 8
I have played with 2, 4, and 6.  Each time a player is added, the player interaction becomes more rich and the game play more chaotic.  All in all, more players makes for more fun.  However, there is one thing that seems common in all three groups--It's difficult to stop the leader, as you have the additional task of thwarting his/her progress (if it's even possible) while advancing yourself--the more prevalent and likely focus of your attention.

One way we've mitigated this↑ is to distribute an option to each other player when the current leader touches a flag.  This brings up another (non)issue...
Options.  Without some sort of house rule, you won't see many of these cards out on the table.

Fun race game with robots. The challenge is that you need to programme them in advance, but with all kinds of element moving and turning and last-but-not-least the other players bumping in to you from time to time, the robots often go in a different direction than initially planned. Also, as the robots becomes more damaged, some of his turns will be fixed until he gets repairs.

It's a game for 2-4 players and usually takes some 45-60 minutes. There are 4 different boards which you can use and combine, and start and finish plus any checkpoint can be chosen per game so every game will play differently. The box says 12+ but my son (8) plays this easily.

A few years down the road. Still like this game, but doesn't get much playtime. Therefore considering to trade this away.

RATING: 4
I enjoyed working out how to move my robot and though Ian seemed to hate it with a passion, my enjoyment never ceased. Maybe I was heavily influenced by the fact that I was always winning though and never screwed over too badly by being pushed.

Ian's rule change - flipping the timer as soon as anyone had finished 'programming' - gave it a far more hectic feel, increased the challenge and allowed for more than a few mistakes - with often hilarious consequences.

Other than myself and Robert, none of the 6 would try it again.

There is little interaction really - as you never know where others will move, it's inefficient to try to shoot others. All that can be done is to program a route that uses your cards efficiently to get to the targets - beyond that, the game feels chaotic enough to be nearly random (though there may be some predictions that are possible).

The cards dealt can feel like the main factor in success or otherwise - damaged robots making potential screwage completely exasperating.

I could imagine even myself getting tired of the mechanics after a few games.

In retrospect, it was mainly the battle against the timer thanks to our house-rule that injected most of its appeal for me.

Crazy, chaotic and lots of fun!  Also very easy to over think.  You might mess up on a turn but watching everything unfold and go wrong is often far more entertaining than seeing everyone's plans work out perfectly.  Only real problem is that if you get too far behind you'll likely be out of the race.

Not a perfect game but I've had fun with it so far.

When I played this game, one of the players had no idea what was going on and could not move at all.  The rest of us were bunched until I made a breakaway.  Once I got ahead, I could move freely and there was no way for the rest of the players to catch up becasue they kept bumping into and shooting eachother.

It was different from any other game I have played, but it was slow moving and the programming mechanic made this feel too much like work.

Fun game if you aren't easily frustrated by the constant thwarting of "best laid plans." Consider four players on a small board the minimum if you want to appreciate the consequences of player interaction, intended or otherwise. Also plays a bit longer than you'd think it would/should. Would love to play it more often.

Bought a second set: Hoping to run at our church's game night with either a massive 8-vs-8 game in Capture the Flag mode, or simply run two simultaneous games. The trick will be selling how much fun chaos can be in a keystone cops fashion for those not able to plan the proper moves.

Classic programming race game that adds some complexity through dealing with the board's special movement tiles with some guessing of what your opponents might do. Neat components with painted metal plastic minis. Old school art style with boards, cards, and bots.

Decisions are relatively simple. Turns can be quick but the overall game is rather long. Power cards are not equal but it isn't a high strategy game.

Program robots five turns at a time to navigate a board to collect flags.  Then all programs run at once and robots crash into each other and push each other off course.

Great fun with the right crowd and a timer. Especially with more robots on the plan. Plan your route from a limit hand of robot moves, then watch it panout or fail as other robots get in the way. Gets dull if there aren't enough other robots on the map or players analyse too much (hence the timer). A good mix of planning, analysis & mad-cap mayhem.

A lot of the guys I studied with love this game. I think it´s an Okay-Game. Somehow I find it a bit boring without really knowing why. Maybe I have to give it another try.

Edit: I gave it another try and I still can´t see why everyone seems to like it. It´s a racing game without any real possibility to plan your moves properly btw. develop a strategy. I´m sure a lot of people enjoy this type of gameplay since it plays fast and you can´t really mess up a turn. But I prefer games in which I can make a plan and see if it works out the way I thought it would.

I have played this game several times and I can see why it is enjoyable.  it is a little too random for my taste and a little to indepth to teach my non-gamer friends so it doesn't fit any niche that well.

I think the game was probably good for when it came out, but I would like to see it get streamlined.

Wonderful game play and great production values.  Suffers from the fact that it can take a very long time to play a game with more than 2 map boards (and even just 2 can take some time).  Nothing beats watching people do the 'robot dance' whilst looking at their cards and trying to figure out how their robot will move. :)  The unfortunate side effect of this comedy act is that it's a sure sign that analysis paralysis is setting in for that player.  My best tip for winning this game (and for avoiding AP in the game):  plan a move which minimizes the danger to your robot, even if that means just sitting a spinning for a turn, or having to move sideways.  Having to reboot from a clone can be a huge set back.

I will hold off on rating this as I have only played it once with two players. In that mode it was tedious in the extreme, there was no interaction whatsoever and the play was almost entirely driven by the card draw.

Hasbro edition. Really liking this game.  Easy rules.  Play length and difficulty is adaptable based on board selection and # of players.  There are also a ton of board combos with just the base set (8 boards!).  It's also a fun game to play, where everyone roots for their robot to do "the right thing". Lots of theme for such a simple rule-set. You really feel as if your robots are zipping and humming across the factory floor. I could see this rating go up to a 9...especially if it plays well with 7 players.  My guess is that 7 players may introduce too much chaos.  Looking forward to my next play. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Players race their robots across the factory floor.  Robots are programmed, by dealing everyone a hand of cards, then using those cards to fill five registers.  Each register is actioned, robots are moved as directed by the card, then the factory floor kicks in - lasers fire, conveyor belts move, etc.  The interaction occurs when robots are hit, pushed, etc.  A great game if you like your chaos programmed.  Handy if you can tell left from right.

[Garfield] While I love the concept, RoboRally is just too agonizingly slow.

RATING: 8
Idea:
Try to guide robot through pitfalls, lasers and moving/turning floors through the flags. While trying to shoot/distract other players robots.

Mechanism:
Put 5 direction cards for your robot secretly and all players resolve those simultaneously. Your plan may fail if something happens and if someone programmed robot fast you have less time too. Also damaged robot has less cards to choose from or even some program cards stay stuck. If robot is destroyed you return to last touched flag.

to who:
This is easy to teach and better with multiple players. Really fun time to time. I havent tried 'special scenarios' but they certainly put more play value to game.

Each player is a robot navigating a death-trap of a factory, filled with conveyor belts, lasers, and bottomless pits.  Each turn you will "program" your robot by creating a sequence of five cards (move 2, turn left, back up, etc.) that your robot will follow, but it's a robot -- it will still blindly follow your instructions even if you mess up and turn the wrong way, or if someone bumps into you and pushes you into a square you weren't expecting to be in.  Most of the fun comes from these mistakes and the ensuing mayhem.

I haven't played this for years and have only played the original version.  It was good fun, if chaotic as all hell.  It does have a potential to go on for a bit too long due to the nature of the chaos but generally it's a fast, furious, zany game that's a lot of fun.

One of the pewter robots is snapped in half (I think it's the zipbot)

There is no priority 600 card (it should be a move 1), but there are 2 priority 500 move 1 cards.

Very original game, but I wish the power-ups were easier to get and didn't set you back so much.  Another problem is that a runaway leader can emerge very early on and become impossible to catch.

Let's not mince words here - some people have the ability to visualize movements in their head...some don't. If you are in the latter camp, you will HATE this game. Your robot will spend its short life running in circles, dropping into pits, and getting shot by your opponents. If you DO have this ability, it's not a bad game. Too many checkpoints can make the game drag, so short courses are my preference.

RATING: 7
Innovative and fun, to a point. The AH version has serious quality problems... the cards are not flexible enough to shuffle without causing permanent damage. This is unfortunate because the game requires the cards to be shuffled A LOT. Gameplay is fun for a while, as it can be challenging to figure out how to program your bot to do exactly what you need to do while taking into consideration all the conveyer belts, rotating gears, etc. But once you play a few games and start to get a grasp on the visualization aspect, it really becomes more a matter of getting the cards you need in your hand. Still, a unique experience overall. Best with about 3-4 players. Get enough robots involved in the same arena and CHAOS ENSUES! And that is where the real fun is to be had.

I played RoboRally once with the first english version a long time ago. It was a 5 player game and we had a blast playing RoboRally.

When we played RoboRally, the game was already out of print. Shortly after our game experience, my brother bought the german basic game which was still available at the time. The main difference between the two basic versions is that the german version supports 4 players instead of 8 players and there are no option cards. Option card are very cool to have on your robot.

To play with 8 players with the german version, you need to get the Crash & Burn expansion which can be hard to find.

Today, Avalon Hill did a reprint of the game. Original game was from Wizard of the Coast.

**Recently played 3 games with the new Avavon Hill version. One board and 4 players. We had lots of fun.

I am looking into getting the new Avalon Hill's copy of his game and getting rid of the german version. The more players the better in RoboRally. The most that I have played with so far is 6 a player game. It was on two boards. I manage to win that game too, using my mechanical arm for 2 of the 3 flags.

It is great when you shoot at the different players to cause them damage. The more players you have, the greater the headache.

I played with my mom, and she doesn't have good cordination with her left and right, the gears etc. So she can go in a pit all by herself.

8 plays since recording games played.

TRADED.

Got an Avalon Hill version of Roborally in a game trade at Granby 2010.

This is the first game I'm really gonna bag on.  I played this back in the day and from then till now I still don't understand why people find this one fun.  Even giving some props to the mechanics, it still holds 0 entertainment value for me personally.  Probably deserves a 4 or 5 rating, but people's inexplicabble liking of the game forces me to make my rating out of vengeance rather than reason.  However, my spite is somewhat satiated by the fact that this game was given to me as a present and is right now in the ownership of people who actually enjoy playing it.  To each his own, I suppose.  Check out Himalaya and Space Alert for similar mechanics with gameplay that has been vastly improved upon.

I nearly wish that instead of 5 moves, you only programmed 4 at a time.  That might make things too easy for almost everyone, but sometimes when you get a hand of crappy cards you just want the turn to be over faster.  I know that everyone should get their fair share of crappy deals, so it should balance out, but it just doesn't feel like it does.  Or if there was some persisting hand, like you keep the program cards you don't use or discard, and you get dealt up to your remaining life at the next turn.  In fact... I might use that next time I play.

I think the biggest issue is an uncontrollable luck factor.  Seems like it gets to a point, the leader is set, and the game is reduced to hoping the leader gets amazingly unlucky.  It would seem that with a bit more control, you could mitigate this problem.  I also think somewhat shorter races are in order (5 flags and four boards?!  You HAVE to be kidding me)

Wake my up ANYTIME for this game. It may be chaotic but I'm a sucker for nostalgia : this is the game that started my boardgaming hobby (a friend of mine had the Wizard edition and in that time, as a student, I had other interests but still : bought the base set and all extensions on EBay (ludicrous prices) and I am planning on painting these miniatures as soon as I find a little bit of time struggling myself away from BGG).

UPDATE: There’s since been another “new edition” (with substantial tweaks I haven’t tried) and I’ve re-acquired another copy of the old new edition.

Tried the new AH version the weekend it came out and I like it quite a bit. Brain-burning fun with a healthy dose of player-inspired chaos. I think it takes a little too long for the AP-prone, sort of like any other race game but good for occasional fun.

Traded away. I will still play it if offered, though (which admittedly isn't often).

This is the most zany racing game that I've played.  I really like the programing sequence and then resolving the sequence.  There are a few issues I have with the game.  The main being is that I think it would take far two long to play with anything more than a basic track.  Unfortunately, the disadvantage of a small track is that when people get close to the goals, things will get extremely chaotic and the person that remains 'on track' can then leave the hectic area and you'll run into a runaway leader syndrome.  I don't know if I prefer this or a more traditional racing game such as Snow Tales.  This one is certainly more innovative however.

Mad rush to get cards in the right place, avoid being shot and get to the race destinations. 

Reminds me of space alert.

- So get random cards and place 5 from the 1-9 you get (depending on how damaged you may be)
- Act in sequence according to card numbers, so others may alter your path if they push you out the way (hence more people = more madness)
- The boards have conveyor belts and cogs that can move, or turn you.
- Each robots auto fires a laser at the end of each turn/round. And there can be lasers on the board, so you can get damaged (more damage, means less cards. Heavy damage means cards are locked into place)
- There are repair and upgrade spaces to heal and improve your robot!
- Don't mess up your left and right.

More people = more madness, so more fun. We played with 4 and 5. One person easily won each game (different person in each game) while 2nd to last was pretty much clumped together. Stupid conveyor belts!

Embrace the chaos. More often than not, an opponent and/or obstacle is going to push/shoot/kill you, and ruin your carefully planned turn, so just throw caution to the wind and don't worry so much about careful planning.

Though I have enjoyed it, it is polarising and there are simply better games. See 'Colt Express'
Issues:
1. Duration. Always played the 'short' races and yet they can take hours. I have no interest in playing a longer race.
2. Punishing. You are punished for failure. This is difficult to justify in a game when there is so much chaos. This would be fine if not for (above) lengthy duration.
3. Chaos. There is fun in chaos but this game just goes too far. The cards you are dealt are random, so in addition to elements on the board changing your plans but what you can do about it is also completely dependent on a random draw. This is fun at first but gets tedious.

Ha, this is awesome. It rocks, it sucks, it kills. In that order. You'll laugh about your opponents, mocking them when you just botched their programmed movement, you'll cry and say bad words, when they did it to you or you mixed left with right (not that THAT happens often). And you'll get killed (well actually your robot playing piece, not your fleshy self) more often than not (either by your adversaries or yourself). The rules are simple, at least after re-reading the booklet for say, three to four times ;) (regarding the minor details, like timing sequence), but in the end everything is explained quite clearly. Now, I heavily recommend getting "Armed and Dangerous" since that will add so much more options and kill-potential (as much for yourself as for your opponents). Oh, and btw it is a lie that people with good spacial thinking have an advantage. Simply fill them up, that should even the odds. Another thing I'd hazard to recommend, rather play on a smaller area, say a single board, instead of a larger one. In that way you'll increase the contact rate quite a bit, and you can catch up to the leader, since he must cross your path several times to check all the flags. Less space + more players = more fun. So say I.

RATING: 8
This is a decent 'programming' game, and is a good bridge for non-gamers.  It does a decent job of having a balance between strategy and 'randomness'.  

A house rule I use frequently is to provide each player with 1 upgrade card for 'free'; adding an additional with each 'death'.  This tends to keep non-gamers quite engaged after a death due to the increased chance of "Revenge" or "Catching Up".

[101 plays] And looking forward to making it 1001.  I can't imagine ever tiring of this fabulously fun game.  

Roborally was fun for me right from the start.  It's a game that new players can enjoy (as long as they know left from right) even while bumbling around the board making classic beginner's mistakes and perishing.  Once you have a medium idea of what you're doing, there's enough randomness involved that you start to have a chance against better players.  But skill and experience have the edge in the long run.  

I really like the learning curve and skill-to-luck relationship here.  There's enough crazy randomness that skill disparities aren't a great barrier to entry for new players, but there's enough challenge and depth that it remains interesting as you become more skilled over time.  When I first started to be able to read the terrain, it was like a third eye opening.  

Actually, before I even could really see it myself, I remember when I began to see that the better players were seeing it.  It's like looking at a contour map:  if you're not really familiar with them, it just looks like a bunch of curvy lines.  Once the concept is explained to you, you can think through "OK, that's a hill." But if you are accustomed to making and using contour maps, you can look at one and immediately visualize the actual land.  That ability to immediately translate from the conventions of a two-dimensional map to visualizing terrain in three dimensions is akin to the skill veteran Roborally players develop in reading the board. And the more you understand the terrain, the more you can develop your ability to chart a path through it.  

The replayability here is inexhaustible.  There are so many different boards that can be combined in different ways, and near-infinite possibilities for designing your own courses on them.  (That's without even getting into the whole area of player-designed boards.)  There are also all kinds of interesting play variants.  

Roborally lends itself well to calibrating for different levels of ability.  You can set up an easy, beginner-friendly course, or a nightmarishly challenging and perilous one.  There are also a number of possible ways to handicap the game, should one wish to.  And you can design a course suitable for more or fewer players, for more or less player interaction, and for a longer or shorter game.  I'm no good at this myself, but I have seen experienced players be very accurately able to lay out a course so that the game will take a certain intended length of time.

A nice light game good for an 'in-between' game or with kids.  Don't expect any depth, but it is fun shooting a pal and then pushing him into a pit.  I don't understand why this sold for so much on EBay.

Controlled chaos. Do yourself a favor and make this game as short as possible. Use a single board and very few flags. This game will wear out it's welcome and have a runaway leader problem if you let it. The mechanics of this game are engaging and thrilling until they turn on you and become repetitive and frustrating, this takes about thirty minutes for me.

March 2008: Very clever game mechanics but plays long. Best played with 4+ players on a single board with just 3 or 4 flags.

RATING: 6.75
To play games like this, I have found it's best to vet your opponents, and don't invite those who are lacking good spacial visualization, as they tend to feel frustrated after inevitably making unintended moves. Maybe, with the right attitude, they may laugh it off, but that's not the same as liking the game.

It also helps to be good at estimating degrees of success stemming from possible outcomes; anticipating the chosen path of other players' robots is vital to avoid having your robot's program interrupted. Nevertheless, you also should embrace the potential for such interaction. When it occurs, sometimes with disastrous results, you're usually faced with two options: determine whether there is sufficient time to pursue your previous goal, or go on the offensive and set back the lead player, preferably the one that pushed/redirected/exploded you off the board.

It's unfortunate some players can't see these tactical aspects beyond the haze of "too random" mechanics, because more people might decide they like it after all.

I have mixed feelings when it comes to Robo Rally.

The core idea and play of the game is fun but it can be quite frustrating when you draw hand after hand of cards that leave you powerless to change your circumstance, i.e. only getting turn cards.  These bad turns can bog down the game and slow it down more than it needs to be.

Given the number of revisions I am surprised to see so little documentation regarding Option Cards and from browsing the forums I can see this is a commonly grey area of much debate on the forums.  Greater clarifications on an official FAQ, errata or new edition to the rules would be appreciated as the version on Wizard’s site currently match the printing of my version.

My main issue is with Avalon Hill's 2010 printing is the boards... if you can call them that aren't really boards so much as thick card which if held at one corner flexes slightly, it may seem nit-picky but essentially fresh out of the box, my boards won't sit flush with a table and can make it slightly awkward moving bits between boards.  Normally I wouldn’t gripe about something like this but considering it is a full game with a retail MSRP of $50 USD, Wizards of the Coast need to step up their game to keep up with the solid production from companies like FFG, MayFair Games and Asmodee.

Bought for hubby because of his fond memories playing this as a kid. But also bought for the kiddies because it's kind of a gateway programming game (& hubby wants to instil the virtues of computer programming at an early age). Although this newer version doesn't have the metal robots of the 80s version, they're still nicely done.

Edited to update: now have a copy of the original 80s version as well (incl two sets of robots but no box). Definitely like the flags & artwork of the new version but the old robots are kind of cool (although nothing wrong with the new robots, really...they're just not metal).

I know some people don't like it but in the games I play usually all the players enjoy themselves. Only on occasions when one player is too far ahead without any badluck, it can be frustrating.

Great concept for a game, especially at the time.  However, there are many games which have taken the programming mechanic and improved upon it.  My current favorite is Pirate Dice: Voyage of the Rolling Seas.

Using dice, rather than cards, speeds up the game significantly.  Also, the death penalty is slightly less brutal, which is nice.

Can't beat that killer robot theme though...

RoboRally's fun theme is just the icing on the cake.  Underneath, it's got a perfect blend of strategy and luck.  Almost every action you perform is based on a random allotment of cards, but using what cards you're granted can be a truly exhausting exercise in strategic resource management.  The various robot upgrades are assigned randomly, but utilizing the upgrades to their full potential is a pretty intense strategy experience.  And the boards themselves are really interesting, each of them being designed with the subtle intricacy of a level in a video game.

Like most other Richard Garfield games, RoboRally's over-reliance on a complex phase structure can be bewildering, even frustrating, but it's a great game, regardless.

Based on one play.
+ Very exciting at it's best.

- Can be like a solitaire when other robots are far away.
- When moving robots, all players concentrated on their own robot, and sometimes ignored exciting situations other robots were involved. This inspired me to design a game of my own, "Captain Planet", where all players witness all exciting situations.

I am surprised at how tired I eventually became of this game, after really enjoying the "program 5 phases in advance" mechanic.  The robot upgrade cards, one of the main gameplay-freshener mechanics, don't come out very fast.

Played 10+ times with 3 and 5 players. I had some real concerns with this game dragging on too long (especially the first two times I played it, once at game group, once at a local game store) but the new AH ed. comes with a sand timer that but the kibosh on anal/paral. This game started out as a 7 that I thought would lose its novelty, but has since grown on me because it makes for an admittedly chaotic and very humorous game that plays well 3-8. I used to think this wouldn't work as a casual game, but I played it with two mid-casual gamers guys, and they both enjoyed it tremendously, and we were in stitches nearly the whole game. Maybe not for young kids or super casual groups, but a real blast to play. Glad I finally picked it up. // I recently taught two more buddies how to play and they LOVED it. We ended up playing 4 games in a row. I had no idea this game would be such a success.

[Programming, Race] [2005 Avalon Hill reprint] Man, this is one chaotic, random game. The programming part is fine, even EASY; that's not the problem. It's even fun for a while when the board chaos is fresh, but it quickly turns frustrating as the random card deal and the narrowing options caused by damage mount. Missing turns due to shutdown or death just make the game more annoying. Throw in the long game time, the unbalanced option cards and players who are out of the running for the win long before it's over and you have a game that I'll only play again under duress.

Könnyed, jópofa robotprogramozgatás. Nagyon random, de nagyon élvezetes is. A leírások alapján kicsit féltem tőle, hogy túl hosszú lesz, ahhoz képest, amennyi van benne, de én eddig minden percét élveztem. Igaz, hogy extrém sok fővel 6+ még nem próbáltam. Ott már lehet, hogy tényleg vannak gondok. De 2-5-en belefér 60-120 percbe, ami soknak is tűnhet, de annyira jó móka, hogy nem az. :)

Azért 8-10 játék után kicsit unhatónak tűnik néha. Kár, hogy nincs eltérő képessége alapból a robotoknak, illetve hogy nagyon nehéz fejlesztést szerezni, így azok szinte teljesen feleslegesen vannak a játékban. Nehezebb pályák, több fővel unalmassá, nyögvenyelőssé válhatnak, mert meghalni azért nehéz, de megcsinálni szinte lehetetlen.

The game that got me into gaming as we now know it.  Bought this back when it came out mostly because Richard Garfield (Magic:TG) had designed it, and a little because of the cool theme.  I know it's not for everyone, but I could play this game anytime, anywhere.

This game can be long but it's wacky, simultaneous action selection at it's best.  The quality of the new AH production is disappointing to say the least.

RATING: 8
Mad fun. Especially hilarious with spatially challenged players. Can start to drag a bit if you run with too many players on small maps or too few players on large maps, so don't do that. Robots, start your engines. Let the mayhem begin...

With the exception of the robot pieces (plastic instead of pewter) the new editions vastly improve the game. The player boards and the starting board in particular are good ideas (and can rather easily be used with the old one as well).

I never understood the appeal of this game. It's completely random and chaotic, and not in a good way. There's basically no strategy - just have your set of cards laid out, and move your robot ( and not near anywhere where you thought you would be ). This may seem fun at first, but very quickly wears out its welcome, and the game drags on and on. It's basically an exercise in endless frustration. If that's your idea of fun, then by all means get to it. If you enjoy playing a game with actual strategy, then ignore this one like the plague. I'm glad that I sold it when I did.

I have had this game since the beginning, and my the box to the WotC edition disintegrated.  It is absurdly complex and is worth every play moment to watch finely tuned move orders go haywire, causing a robot to speed into a bottomless pit.  The new edition added a number of needed things, such as player sheets and a timer (forcing more people into the robo-rally dance), and though I am saddened at the removal of crushers, it's not a big deal and my old boards still work.

Nope...chaos ensued. "I like randomness, I don't like absolute chaos" was a quote from another BGG'er that put it best, I think. Tough call though because there's things I like about it.

Good chaotic fun.  Tougher than you'd think to plan your moves.  Much embarassment ensues when you keep driving your robot off the edge of the board.


EDIT:  Last time we played this there were some hard feelings.  This is just not a game for everyone.  I don't dig shuffling the cards every damn turn.  Playing this game is actually kind of a chore..."6" is generous.  A classic, and I respect that, but I won't miss it.

I love Roborally, but I know this game is not for everyone. I personally love the programming of your robot, and the chaos that comes forth of conflicting routes that your robots travel. Some people can't stand that there robot is moving directions that they didn't intend, but for me that is the biggest fun factor of the game. Chaos in a box. But fun chaos.

Finally got to play RoboRally after years and years of hearing about it and seeing about it and never getting a chance to play. I assumed from what I knew about the game that I wasn't going to like it, and it pretty much met my every expectation. Concept-wise, it's great! Programming your little robot to move around and make objectives is a cute and singular idea. But the chaos in the game makes it totally off from what I like in games. I don't even have to go into it for this comment: one bump or unexpected occurrences means your robot will go bonkers for the rest of the round, doing shit you didn't plan for. Maybe some people find this hilarious but I find it frustrating and stupid. Yeah, you could go wide out of range so that you limit the chances of your opponent hitting you, but then you're really crawling towards the objectives - and this game is kinda slow anyway. Feels very wash and repeat, even with the progression towards completing objectives. Yeah, I was actually expecting I was going to like it slightly better than what I thought it would be but it was not to be. Still, a very cute idea and so it gets points for that.

One of the classics of board gaming.  With the use of cards to program and not knowing what other people do, it turns into a hillarious demolition derby even though no one is really 'intending' on bumping into each other.  It can play as long or as short as you want depending on how complicated the board, or boards, are.  It should be in everyone's game shelf.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I found this game hilarious! Our meticulously planned moves were destroyed by the actions of other players or our own stupidity ... all without malice. I was inadvertently pushed into a laser beam by another player and stuck there for 5 moves as I (or so I thought) lined myself up to grab the flag! Miscalculations of movement made me go round and round the conveyor belt. Players drove right off the board ... madness and very entertaining! A great game with the right group and number of people.

I've tried RoboRally several times on two different occasions so far and my feelings are kind of mixed about it. On one hand it's a fastpaced, easy to learn game and I've had some good laughs playing it. On the other hand the game has a weakness in the fact that the learning scenarios aren't very interesting. When I play the easier scenarios I almost get bored because nothing surpricing happens. The game is best when playing medium+ difficulty scenarios. It really shines when things get just a bit crazy and unpredictable! :-) A good beer and pretzel game in my opinion.

I own the original version of the game with the pewter figures, but I've played the newer edition. Although, I enjoy the design and heft of the pewter figures, the starting bay is very welcome addition and the plastic(?) flags are nice, aesthetically pleasing as well. Played it with five players recently and, even though I was pushed down a pit (twice), I still would love to try it with eight. Every time it's been brought out, my group has always had a great time.

RATING: 3
Roborally is a blast.  This may not be the deepest game, and it can be rather dependant on luck, but Roborally never seizes to provide laughs.  Roborally is without any long term stategy, as tactical decisions rule the day in this offering.  Since every program is assembled from a random card draw all one can do is cross their fingers and do what they can with what they've got. Chaos is the fuel in Roborally's engine, and where as that would make most games fall apart, Roborally is held together with the strange cosmic glue.  

UPDATE:  Roborally is falling in my favor.  The game can drag on and although it can still lead to laughs, it is becoming less desired to find time on the table.

UPDATE:  With Dragon Delta becoming my preferred simultaneous action selection race game, Roborally is beginning to show it's age.  It can still generate laughs, and may well deserve a classic status, and it also is always a fun game to introduce people to, yet I have grown tired of this once often played juggernaut.

UPDATE: After a recent playing this game has been again lowered.  Roborally is a game that has alot of early appeal, but the gameplay and humor quickly wearout.  Once all players are adequate enough with programming their routes this really is nothing other than a luck fest.  The chaos and bad luck of others can be amusing, but the joke is one dimensional.  This is ultimately an adult version of snakes and ladders - but can drag on for hours.

In [b][i]RoboRally[/i][/b] you control a happy-go-lucky laser-wielding robot seeking to be the first to complete an obstacle course. The core mechanic is all players secretly and simultaneously place multiple orders that are then revealed and enacted. Your orders will then interact with your opponents' orders in unexpected ways. You'll also take damage over the game which will restrict your options and then eventually kill your bot--don't worry, you come back. The damage element adds an extra dose of chaos that I appreciate. The longer courses can outstay their welcome and so I only recommend the short- or medium-length maps.

I must admit that I was a little dubious as we began to play.  I also have to admit that I am a wretched player of this game.  I was worse than doing the robo dance, I was standing doing the robo dance.  I came in last in flags achieved - I never got one, behind a guy who had died 3 or 4 turns earlier who had only achieved 2 flags.  I really like this game.  I rate games relatively.  If I really like the game I always rate it higher than the geek average which was 7.5 so RR got a 7.85.

I absolutely loved this game when it came out - To me, it was the best game I knew at the time. I have since come to accept that it has a runaway leader problem that I think (sadly) cannot be fixed. It is still fun to play with the right group of people and proper board configuration, but there are many other games out there now that without a question are better than RoboRally. That said, there's no game that "replaces" RoboRally - It stands unique in pantheon of games.

The specials never got used since it was a waste of time so I changed the rules so you get one automatically at each checkpoint.  The game is still a little to slow and very frusterating for most people who can rarely understand exactly how thier robot will move.

After many years of wanting to try this game and never getting the chance to. I decided to finally buy it before it was to late. What a terrific decision this turned out to be. I now own both the WOTC 2nd edition and the AH 3rd edition of the game.

This game is flat out awesome fun. The game isn't that hard to learn and after the first play or so it becomes very easy to play. Games can be played with 2-8 players, but it seems like 5-6 would be the sweet spot. It's just more fun and chaotic with robots pushing and shooting at each other all over the place. It makes the game just that much more fun.

I must admit that I do suffer from AP at times. A habit which I try to get away from with every play and I was a little afraid that this might not be a good game for me. Due to my slight AP problem, but I had no problems with it at all during game play and once you have played the game a few times. Your pace will pick up.

The components in the game are very nice. I do however like the single sided thicker boards of the WOTC 2nd edition a lot more than those of the double sided 3rd edition by AH, but they are still ok and able to be combined together. However I do like the 3rd edition flags, docking bays and player mats. They provide a very nice touch to the game.

So if you have been even the slightest bit curious about this game. Don't delay. Go out and buy it now before it's to late and goes out of print forever. This game should be in everyones collection. I highly recommend this game to everyone from Families to gamers.

Many thanks to my beautiful and loving girlfriend for finding the 2nd edition of this game and giving it to me for Christmas. Knowing that I had always wanted to try it. I love you cupcake. Your the best. :)

A combination of Wings of War and Fearsome Floors or Fast Flowing Forest Fellers, beautifully published in an oversized box. The theme appeals rather to boys than girls and because of this it's hard to play it with kids. When you convince them to it brings a lot of fun and laughter.

A fine family game that can be played by hardcore gamers as well. It has original theme and nice graphics. Take a look and maybe you'll love it.

In theory a very nice racing game. In practise, this is almost always played on too long tracks, when there is too little mayhem and contact for this to work. Playing with time-limits is a must, as some players will otherwise take forever to take their turns.

Robo Rally is a great game if you have a group of people who will latch onto the mechanic. That said, I have played it with my wife and daughter and they play just fine, and seem to enjoy it, but don't ask for it to come out. The simultaneous card reveal is a neat mechanic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
You really need a lot of players, or at least a lot of robots.  Interaction is the fun, so with only 2 or 3 players, use two robots each.  Also key is keeping the course overlapping and tight.  So far everyone I've played with has loved it, although there is a potential for a new player to be put off if eliminated.

Entertaining programming game.  I love the theme and it is pretty entertaining when your best plans go to waste.  I don't know that I would be in the mood to play this too much and I do think it can drag a little bit.  I certainly can see why this game gets such praise.

RATING: 7
I enjoy this even though it's a bit old and it's an awkward size of box that doesn't fit with anything else. You have to play on a small board with only a few flags though or else it will run really long. It can be easy to get into situations where you're so far behind you don't have a chance.

This game can potentially take forever. But it's funny seeing people moving their hands, eyes, fingers, and mouth trying to "program" their movements in their head. It's sometimes tough to keep track of everything that's going on...conveyor belts moving, lasers shooting, other robots attacking and pushing and bumping...but the end result is pretty neat. 
Watch stop-motion of this game on youtube, and you can see it really reflects what a futuristic robot race could be like.

One of my favorite multiplayer games. Simple rules, easy to understand.  Bad hands can be frustrating, and overly complex boards can really slow down play.  But we still keep playing it. As my friends say "Robo Rally is not about forgiving". We have held grudges for years over this game.

I like this game much more in theory than I do in practice. Robots, lasers, mind-bending tracks to race around in a very chaotic and violent way. What's not to like?
Well, every time I've played it I have felt "Wow! this should be so much fun...but it really isn't". I think that is mostly because the programmed movement has a crippling effect on people prone to Analysis Paralysis and then the game drags on and on. Most of my games have a playtime of 3 hours, and that is with only 3 flags on a single board. Now, I'm not saying that the game is bad, I'm sure it is all kinds of fun when played with a drastically lower play time. I however have played all I can muster of this one.

A facinating game. The all reveal they're move at once mechanic is great. But I remember that I only thought the first rounds where fun. I have not played it for years, but have recently bought my own copy. Maybe the premade maps will enchant the game?

My few plays have confirmed to me the widely held opinion that this is fun, chaotic, and sometimes frustrating. Best when games are kept short (like just one board and two or three flags). There's a risk that some people get really frustrated and don't enjoy it.

RATING: 9
I enjoy the "programmed movement" idea, and Robo Rally is the best implementation of that idea. Just don't make the mistake of setting up a long, difficult course, which tends to lead to a fatiguing game and/or a breakaway leader.  I recommend a modest course: two boards with two or three checkpoints. Put the checkpoints in relatively accessible locations, and place them so that there will intersecting traffic between robots who are on different "legs" of the course.  Although I love Robo Rally, it's not a safe recommendation for just anyone.  It's the type of game that requires a lot of mental energy and planning, all of which might be negated by the unpredictable choices of your opponents.  Not everyone enjoys that style of game.  Also, many players struggle with visualizing the spatial relationships and movement patterns, making the game a frustrating experience for them.

A unique mechanic with the programmed cards. The theme is tied in well with the wrenches and robots and conveyors and so forth. A very clever design.
The game stalls down and is not its best unless you only play 2 boards and you also need to stagger the 1-4 flags around so that you get good robot "interaction" so that the guy in dead last can at least try and screw with the guy in the lead a few times during the game.

I really enjoy this game. Emphasis on the I. No one else does. I have far too many people declare hatred for RoboRally before the completion of game #1. People find it wearisome and spatially complex. 

I am a visual person and have no difficulty translating movement cards and conveyer belts into results on the board, but I can understand the difficulty for others. I just can't understand the hatred. I haven't given up on the game yet. With 5-6 seasoned players, I imagine this would be a joy to play.

Far too long playtime. If it played in an hour or less I would make sure it hit the table much much more often.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
There are things that are meant to go wrong and planning your robot in this game is definitely one of those things. It is meant that you should bump, zap and oops and to in some extent plan for that it will happen. There is definitely skill and strategy involved in the game, but it is the random things that make it fun. It takes some skill, but there is ways to avoid runaway leader problems (make the routes cross each other and don’t place the flags in too vulnerable positions). This game (with Carcassonne) opened my eyes for designer games.

I have mostly played with the newest edition and though I heard many complaints about that edition, I think it works fine and in some ways improve previous editions. I’m not entirely fond of some of the maps though, as they seem too hard or boring.

This game plays better with more players and fewer player boards. It is too bad that many of the boards aren’t that useful with playing with only one board. Why is it better with fewer boards? Well, there is more chaos and the game time is pretty short where you can usually clock in a game in little more than an hour. Why is it better with more players? Well, the interaction and chaos is the reason here. It doesn’t take much longer to play with more players and the programming is simultaneous. At most I have played with 10 players on one small board; that was fun. My recommendation is to play to 3 or 4 flags and don’t put the flags on too vulnerable spots.

I enjoy this game even though there can be a high luck component based on the cards you're dealt.  In fact, I think I enjoy the challenge of trying to figure out how to best cope with a bad hand of cards more than just getting all the cards I need.  Some people dislike the runaway leader problem, but in my experience this can be mitigated by careful course design.

More people=better game.  Love the chaos and the insanity that ensues.  Quickly becoming one of my favorite games.

Edit.  After having it a few years I find that I try to find other games besides this to play.  I'm just not a fan anymore.  I keep it because the wife loves it.  I think the fact that there could be a person so helplessly screwed and can't do anything about it bugs me.  I want a game that always gives an opportunity to get back in the running.

"The epic game of spinning around on the spot, while everyone else laughs." I really like it. I'm also pretty good, even while drunk, at rarely messing up. I think you need good spacial awareness (you need to imagine the bot's actions as you place your orders face down, taking into account other robots' likely moves, and conveyor belts, turntables etc. on the board). Having a mind that works in terms of event sequencing (this happens, then that, then that - I view all tasks as series of steps, so it's par for the course for me) is imperative for success; some people seem to be able to do it, while others can't. Chaotic fun, anyway.

A game that is a nice break from the more traditional board games. While luck certainly plays a part, the off-handed craziness makes for a fun evening of lazers, belts, and bots.

I recommend playing this game with no more than 4 if you want to get done within 1 hour.

A game especially well-suited for the analytic-minded. If you're a programmer, you'll love Roborally.

However, caution must be used when designing a layout. Far, far too often, people think a long, difficult race will be fun. They're wrong. Make it short and "easy" (trust me, it'll be harder than it looks and the players will happily screw each other up every chance they get). It's far better to have a game end prematurely (you can always play again) than have it drag on and on. Playing on more than two boards is just asking for trouble.

RATING: 6
In theory, I *love* this game. Wonderful bits, great variety/replayability, good choices, direct and indirect player interaction. But in practice, it almost *always* takes too long. Setting time limits for programming robots is a must, but also I think guidelines for how many boards per player should be established.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
This game suffers from bad design. Once a player falls behind from making a mistake, they will never recover, effectively throwing them out of the game. See "Space Alert" for an example of how programming moves ahead of time can be done RIGHT.

A fast and furious race game that is a lot of fun. I imagine that with the wrong players this could drag on with AP but as long as everyone is playing at a fast pace and keeping things moving it's a blast.

Entertaining, but only on a small area, max two boards and make sure people will run into each other all the time by placing the flags right. Otherwise, a runaway leader will spoil the fun. I have the first edition and all expansions except Crash & Burn.

RATING: 7
I like it, but everyone else in my gaming group found it confusing and irritating.  I have to admit that it is a bit long for what it is.  For example, an easy 3-point map probably takes over an hour, and longer than a Formula De race.  Since there is a lot of uncontrollable chaos (a feature on the box!), I guess you either like a bout of craziness, or you don't.

So my rating is based on having to put up with the complaints of the people who I drag into playing it!

Note that you must have at least 4 robots (players) to make things interesting, and playing more than one robot does become very confusing.

pre-programmed robots with autofiring lasers in a factory that very well may kill them, what could possibly go wrong?

a great game that has a pre-program mechanic. you are pretty much assured to run into and shoot someone. the issue this game has is analysis paralysis big time. you should set up a timer that kicks on after there is only one person programming or do one for the whole programming turn. if everyone is good about it you may not have to do that but some players get really hampered by the spatial aspect of it and it can bog things down.

Fun chaos not to be taken seriously. Someone told me their winning strategy: come out fighting to cause more damage to the other robots than you receive. Then go after a bonus card. Then go after the goals. I tried this strategy once but couldn't make it work. My current theory is it doesn't lend itself to strategy; just have fun with it.

Imagine playing dodgeball with friends in a room full of kickballs...in which no one ever is expelled from the game for being hit.  This comes close to roborally for me.  It's a hoot a first, then tiresome, then annoying.

I've played twice, for a total of 5 hours of play.  I've yet to reach a flag!!  Ok, that's not entirely true.  The one time I landed on a flag, I didn't survive the round, so I had to go back to my starting point.

May raise my rating if I have a better experience in another game

update: played 3p game on a very simple board and had a much better time.  was really fun without so much chaos. raising rating from 5 to 6

I had a blast with this several years ago with a bunch of physicists and copious alcohol, but very recently I bought a copy and tried it out on my (increasingly long suffering) familiy.

6 of us sat down to the shortest available beginners course and it was abandoned after about 2 and a half hours, when somebody finally made it to flag 2 (out of 3).

Gripes: It's too long a game. The initiative system seems largely pointless and with so many players really slows down gameplay. It's too easy to get lousy cards. There seemed to be little player interaction except for people apologising for inadvertently shooting each other.

Possible solutions: Fix the initiative (perhaps go broustophedon, or rotate it with the dealer?). Allow card trading (people will tend to feel sorry for those behind them in the race and tell the leader to go sing - avoiding the runaway leader problem). Make shooting optional (same arguments apply).

I haven't actually tried any of these - they may save the game as a fun familiy activity, but it would be hard to damage it much IMHO.

RATING: 6
Fun racing game that can (and probably will) be pretty chaotic. The most fun comes from players that wrote a bad program for their robot or just got shot by other players.

There is a good amount of luck involved, but due to the nature of this game, it doesn´t really decide much.

I like how there is very little downtime as people are taking their turns at the same time.  Every time I've played it, though it suffers from a severe runaway leader problem:  One person breaks away from the pack, and everybody else shoves each other into pits and blasts each other with lasers trying to catch up.  

Fortunately, the runaway leader is usually me.

(Mai 2012, Commande internet via Francois) Un jeu intéressant, mais qui demande tout de même de bonnes capacités en visualisation spatiale. Ce n,est pas toujours évident de programmer les bons mouvements de notre robot en fonction des différents éléments perturbateurs du jeu. Il faut également être en mesure de bien visualiser ses 5 actions en avance dans sa tête avant de réaliser les actions. C'est un jeu qui amène une bonne interractivité à plusieurs et qui est divertissant, mais ça ne plaira pas à tout le monde. De plus, le facteur hasard peut faire en sorte que l'on se trouve avec des mauvaises cartes et que le robot tourne en rond ou ne fait aucun mouvement en raison de cela. C'est un jeu tout de même original et esthétique. Ce jeu frustre trop ma blonde toutefois et elle ne veut plus y jouer. C'est un jeu qui peut plaire toutefois aux amateurs de jeux vidéo!

Rating after one play. I like the flexibility provided by the multiple boards, and to my knowledge, it has pretty unique mechanics. However, I found myself fighting with the mechanics more than actually playing the game. I was forever picking the wrong turn card because I forgot which way the conveyor would spin me. Although I suspect this would change with more plays, it then seems to me that there would be an obvious optimal path to take, and if you couldn't take it, it would be purely luck of the draw. The pushing rules make it so that when there IS player interaction, it happens purely by chance, and mostly ends up hurting both players. Shooting rules are similar; you sometimes accidentally shoot people, but can't really try to go for the kill. Finally, there are a multitude of upgrade cards but only a couple will ever make it into play. That is sad, because they would give it a lot more variety. A game like this would benefit from starting player powers, but if not, it would at least be better if more of these upgrades came into play. Monsters Menace America, King of Tokyo, etc. handle mutation/modification cards a lot better. Nevertheless, I would be willing to play this one again. Perhaps some of my concerns were specific to the scenario.

Fun if you are in the right mood - more fun with more players. 

Pros: variable boards and scenarios, customability, lots of opportunities to screw with your opponents. Easy to bring out and play with new players.

Cons: player elimination is an issue, the robot pieces all look the same to me. Gets a little repetitive to execute all the moves after a few plays.     

On a personal note: it seems that apparently I have none of whatever skill it is that is needed for programming a robot to move towards a flag. My bots just tend to move abount randomly until they eventually drive into a pit. I doubt I will ever be able to win this game :(
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It's an okay game, mostly notable because it can be a way to teach programming or even electronics (especially multi-processor programming) to a lay audience.  From a fun point of view, I don't like that the bots shoot each other -- it makes the game too confrontational for me.  I think the options are fun, and it would be good to start the game with one or more.

This is a good game if you're interested in adding a little spice (and chaos) to your evening.  "Programming" your bot is fairly straight forward, provided you have been passed the cards you need (if you didn't get any left turns, you may have to turn right a few times to get your bot to point in the right direction).

I liked the simultaneous moves and the special ability cards, but the game is a tad too long, random and chaotic for my tastes, so I sold my copy.  YMMV.

RATING: 6
While I'm not sure we played with the correct rules, the quick and dirty programming (we actually used the sand timer immediately every time rather than only for the last player) makes for a fun and frantic game in which you're not quite sure how things are going to go down.

I'd like to play again with the fast and furious programming, but with the other rules in place as well.

RATING: 6
It's kind of amusing provided you don't mind that slightly dissonant combination of heavy forward planning and player-induced chaos. I can see where it could last way too long though. I wouldn't want to play more than 3 checkpoints. Keep that timer handy!

Oh, one more thing: for a programming game, Himalaya beats this one hands down. It's less chaotic and the player interaction a bit more meaningful.

This is one of my absolute all-time favorite games.  It is just the perfect marriage of theme, planning, and chaotic mayhem.  Don't make the mistake of using more than 2 boards at once!  You need to keep the players all very close together to maximize accidents.  Because there is nothing funnier than someone getting pushed into a hole or onto an inescapable conveyor belt when they didn't expect it, and watching the death play out slowly via their subsequent commands.

RATING: 7
[Initial Impression: 7] I thought this would be a fairly dry exercise in programmed movement, but it turns out to be far more fun than I would have thought. I have to project myself "into" the board in order to track the effects of gears, conveyor belts, etc., but it gets the job done. Miscalculate, or have someone with a higher priority push you before your movement, and you'll find your bot wildly off course. Recovering from such mishaps and locked actions takes a special kind of fluidity and vision, including an ability to adapt to the cards at hand. Spatial thinkers will love it, and it will make others cringe. The chaos comes from the interactions between players as they try to reach the same goals simultaneously, but predicting and reacting to others adds the element of uncertainty that makes the game shine.

My husband rates this an 8, and I rate it a 6, so let's compromise and go with 7. I am super directionally challenged, so I am rubbish at this game.

RoboRally, where basic robotic programming meets hand management, chaotic mazes, and the sand-timer for some interactive robot madness.

It's unfortunate that no one has republished all the increasingly pricy expansion boards for this, and it's easy to lust over the old Wizards of the Coast versions and their pewter robots, but the basics are captured and delivered, even in the Hasbro/A-H reprint that I own.

Chaos, and bad things happening to you, have rarely been so hilarious.  A runaway leader may cruise to victory, but still the Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad Factory floor of RoboRally is a hoot.

Caveat: if you do not find spacial-thinking/planning your cup of tea, and/or are not a computer progammer, this may not be the game for you.

But I have loved this game since playing my friends copies of the Wizards of the Coast edition(s), and I think this is one of those games all gamers should just have: for me this is an essential.  Great game.

WARNING: The quality of the pieces in the new edition are nowhere near as good as the original.

By the designer of Magic the Gathering. Technically designed first, and because of that we have Magic (long story).

I played the original game a lot, and always almost liked it, but the new edition goes a long ways to fix the problems of the original. The best addition is the inclusion of a timer. The mechanic is simple, and not what you might expect, but it helps remove AP. Some of the core issues of the original still exist, but they can be dealt with. My rating is for the new edition.

This is a great game for the spacially cognisant.  However, those who get right and left mixed up should not play.  It is a great interactive battle fest, and can be fun just rtying to mess up others in leu of winning.

Down-side is that some find it increadibly frustrating, and can't actually program a viable move on a solitaire game!  There is also a lot of confusion on the action sequences and their effect on robots.  This is definitely a love/hate game, and should not be foisted on those who are unwilling. 

Last frustration, the expansions are impossibly expensive...

Some clever mechanics. Unfortunately it's completely lost in the tedious, boredom, randomness and silliness.

I can see that the interchangability of things make it quite replayable... would I replay it? No chance

I got into a debate over how plannable turns are in this game. I liken it to computer programming while the computer is upside down and you're blindfolded. Good luck

RATING: 8
Reminiscent of the computer games Robot War and Robo Sport, as well as the Star Fleet Battles board games. It is a smart game, requiring precision forethought, as well as some luck. This is a game that a computer programmer would absolutely LOVE.

The object of the game is to race your robot across the various random boards to touch a given number of flags (number up to the players) and then return to the starting flag to win.

You get nine cards in which to program five moves for your robot in your five registers. The cards are a random mix of move forward, backward, left/right turns, and U-turns. Everyone locks in their five moves, and then all moves are executed simultaneously, although the timing on the cards tell you what moves take precedence, as one robot could push another robot before that robot has a chance to move. If a robot is in the LOS of another, then it takes a point of damage. Robots can take up to 10 pts before being destroyed, and players start with 4 lives. However, the more damage a robot has, the fewer cards he receives for the next round! On the 5th hit, the last register is "locked", and hence the robot will be forced to execute the last move card programmed there. It is possible to reset the damage/memory by shutting down, but this means you're a sitting duck for a turn. You can also repair damage if you arrive at a "wrench/repair/archive" point.

The boards represent treacherous factory floors, where there are conveyor belts, turntables, pits, and other contraptions designed to mess up your movement (by moving/turning you unwillingly in-between your registered moves), or at worst, kill you. One false move, and you could fall into a pit, losing a life, and setting you back to your last "archive" point. This is a way-point you set on the board, so you don't have to start all over again at the start flag.

You need a math degree in vector analysis to do well in this game (well, sort of). Given your cards and looking at the board, it is a deterministic exercise in optimally programming your robot to make the most progress towards a flag, given the cards you are dealt. However, there is substantial interaction among the players as your plans may be severely disrupted by another player's faster move. So, your perfect path could lead you into a pit (like what happened to me several times in the first game). Also, there are "option" cards which give the robots additional offensive/defensive/movement capabilities.

It's chaotically fast play, with some potential downtime in programming the cards by some AP players, but always results in funny and generally frustrating outcomes. The game length can be adjusted to the players' tastes. Since it is a race, players will bunch up on another during the first several turns (and around flags), but a good/lucky player will be able to break-away and coast to victory (literally, on the conveyor belts). There is no catch-up mechanism, but hey, that's life (and robots).

I enjoyed this game to a point.  I think my son would love it.  The problem I had was that it lends itself to big time analysis paralysis.  The game really dragged and was too long.  I would definitely not want to be the person managing/overseeing the moves.  So, the concept is great, but it's not a perfect game by any stretch of the imagination.  I had fun for the first hour of the two or more hour game.

Here's the thing with Roborally... We probably played this about 50 times in the mid 1990's, and just got burnt out.  It's a wonderful game, and the expansions make it much better.  Somehow, though, I'm still kind of tired of it.  Huh.
Note:  With the expansions (particularly Grand Prix and Armed & Dangerous), this is an "8" for me.

This is a racing game, but it plays really slow.  Runaway leaders can turn your experience into a long battle for 3rd place.

We play Roborally at lunch time when running our school holiday program, Kraftworks for Kids. The program is for kids aged 9 - 14. This game is hard for the younger kids to grasp -- most young kids trust to luck once a move involves turning conveyor belts. We pair up the beginners with one of the Leaders. Sometimes we don't finish the game by the end of lunch but it can easily be resumed at the end of the day while waiting for parents to arrive. Lots of fun for the adults!

RATING: 5
The archetypal programmed movement game. It's a good humoured, if highly chaotic experience with far too little control for this to qualify as a strategy game. I'd suggest separating the cards into 'moves' and 'turns' and allowing players to request as many of each as they choose up to their hand limit. Don't set up too large a board as the game can drag on, especially with more players. Great miniatures.

Original WotC version.
We had many a good night playing this and we had the Armed & Dangerous expansion too, which was great!  Pre-program your robot with turns and moves, avoiding the lasers, pits, and other factory nastiness.  Get upgrades and weapons to wreak havok on your opponents and claw your way to the flag first.  The only downside is when someone gets far ahead and people spread out, it becomes you against the game instead of each other.  My wife is painting our minis and they look sweet!

RoboRally has not aged well.  It still makes a good drinking game, but that's about it.

This is a very fun game! VERY chaotic and Exciting! Though there are people who would feel it getting to repetitive and boring if it goes for too long. So for these people play a nice short map and it should be FUN! 

For people like me who is willing to play to the end, there are so many map configurations to try!

Only played with 3 ppl so far and it was FUN! My friend and I kept trying to aim for an Option Card space and got so drawn into the game that we got beaten by my nine year old sister without even realising what she was doing! Hehe... 

Also, the game might get too hectic with too many players. Probably 3 - 5 is the sweet spot :)

Definitely not a game for everyone. I really like the concept, but not sure if I love it just yet. I will also need a lot more plays to be sure.

First impression is that I'm not so certain that this can really be exciting. Too many unforeseen incidents and the time in the beginning isn't really spent on a strategy other than your own.

I love the fact that the time spent playing the game is somewhat independent of the amount of people at play. So if 8 people play, it will only take slightly longer than a 4 player game.

After the first play I wasn't too sure I enjoyed this game but after a few more under my belt the game has become a lot more fun. The control that you have mixed with the chaos of the other players really makes this game a winner. The fun is in watching all the interaction occur not on trying to win. Anyone who takes the game too seriously will get frustrated beyond belief.

1st played 01/02/08. Taught in ~10min. Played w/ 4 & took 2 hrs w/ the start board, however we didn't discard unused cards each round (slowed down). The object is to make it to 3 checkpoints (in order) before others do. Players pick 5 cards for a phase hidden, from their hands (start w/ 9), in a specified sequence. Cards are move 1-3, move 1 backwards, turn left/right, or u-turn. Spaces on the board: spin left/right, laser 1pt damage (dam), move 1x/2x on track, repair 1 pt dam (if you end the round there) & walls (block view/movement). Everyone plays a card & then evaluate the board at the end of each phase (including robot shots in direction faced at others). You have 9 dam pts before you die & have 3 lives. You also die if you run off the map. If you end a phase at a checkpoint you can clone yourself there (death restart space). Each dam received, one less card drawn. After a few dam pts, late phase cards are locked & carry to next round. Bots may %u201Cpower down%u201D to repair all dam; however are sitting ducks that round (don%u2019t move). Special improvement cards can be received when bots are on certain spaces at the end of a round. I'd recommend it if you know someone who has it, however I wouldn't consider purchase.

Finally took a stab at this game after buying it for Christmas last year. Played it with my three kids (ages 13, 11, & 6). I have also bought Robot Turtles as a started to help my youngest understand the concept of planning and programming, but we haven't played that in months. My kids were a whole lot faster at finishing/filling their registers than I was (had to tell them we weren't going to use the timer for the slowpoke on this first go around!). Yes - that means that 2 hrs was because I was slow... not my kids. My 6-yr old even impressed me with his ability to calculate where his robot was going to end up at the end of the turn through a conveyor belt and gear! Overall was a blast to play and I look forward to bringing this out a whole lot more with my kids.

RATING: 9
There is something vaguely captivating about Roborally that I just can't really explain.  I suppose it simply appeals to the computer geek in me.  I have the newer Avalon Hill version and have already taken the liberty to paint the bots as it can get a bit confusing telling players apart in close quarters.

Luck of the cards is certainly a factor, but the more skilled players will always find a way to get the job done.  I love the chaos that comes from having multiple players as things can get quite crazy.  If the runaway leader problem was fixed and the game was shortened a bit, I would easily give it a ten.

-Here's hoping for expansion reprints too!

One of my very favorites.  Rewards quick thinking and offers a lot of fun . . . as long as you believe a certain amount of chaos can be fun.

The only downside to the game is that you may be hard pressed finding a bunch of folks who like it as much as you.  [My wife doesn't "program" well and continually runs her robots off the boards or into pits (without being bumped) . . . she doesn't like to play this one.]

This game.... TWO HOURS... of my time to literally feel like I accomplished nothing aside from hitting a flag. I refuse to rate it a 1 because there is a game there... but it's not a game for me. I will never play this again. I can't recall a time I didn't at least have FUN playing a game.. but this was a chore for me to get through, started out enjoying myself and quickly divulged into a point of never wanting to play again.

I like the combination of deep thinking (planning moves) and humor (robot/board interaction throwing all the deep thought into chaos).  I much prefer a short game with 2-3 boards over a larger, longer game due to a player inaction aspect that's emphasized in the later stages of a long game.

A lot of fun for a group with analytic minds. Needs a "pen & paper" to track player order (to make the turns go faster). A lot of laughter when the players get their robot instructions incorrect! Requires a large table (and a speedy host) when there are 6+ players.

Best with 4+ players.

This could be a 3/4 or 7/8 depending on the group you are playing with, as it's just meant to be plain light hearted fun. With that mindset, the right group, the right number of players, the right game setup, the right game length the game will have some funny moments for sure as people fail to program their robots, get shot, run into things etc.  With the wrong group it will be downright painful and tedious for sure, and if you put yourself out of the running it will be a long wait to start a new game.  

Recommended to not play more than 40 minutes or so I would think as it would start to get pretty old fast, as there just isn’t much too it. Will have to play again with the right group and conditions

RATING: 4
Ugh, this game is tiring.  I think I might need to lower my rating a bit.  The only thing that is keeping me from lowering it down to 5 is that I think you could make some pretty interesting house rules and variation that would make it better.  I think some capture the flag type variants would hold some promise.

UPDATE: Lowered to a 4.  The only thing stopping me from putting this on the trade pile is the fact that my son likes to play with the robots.

This game is heavily dependent on setting up a good map.  No matter what style of game you like in RoboRally, your map layout is either going to facilitate it or ruin it.  There are some folks I won't play this with, but the pre-programming of your move really works for me.

More fun than I had expected.  You're trying to get your robot through the course before everyone else, but not only are they trying to melt you into a puddle with lasers, the course is trying to smash you flat.  You get a hand of cards each turn and then play five of them to set up your sequence of moves.  Hilarity ensues when a mistake is made or something unexpected happens, resulting in the robot doing exactly what you had ordered, in the wrong place.

I don't overly mind bad or mindless games; though I feel this is one of the worst games I've ever played. I suppose children would love this game due to the silliness factor. However the game mechanics are so random that I feel you may as well just submit your moves at random and see what happens. Game play takes forever and all you do is move around in a semi random direction (cards direct movement, there's alot of turn cards) hoping that you get to the flags and not in the pits. I will never suggest this game to anyone (child or adult) and will walk out of a games day if the game is brought out.

RATING: 6
Not awful, not great. The player who gets out in front usually comes off the best, but as soon as players start taking damage the game rapidly descends into frustrating chaos. 
Also, with more than 3 players, games can drag somewhat. Even 'quick' 1 board games with 3 checkpoints have been known to drag on for 3-4 hours with 7 or 8 players.
Have played this a few times where I've had a clean run to the finish in 1st place and then sat and waited 1-2 hours until the 2nd place comes in to the finish. Just lucky card draws and not being interrupted by any other bots, rather than skillful play on my part. This is obviously a problem with the game. 
A good house rule would appear to be to give everyone 2 upgrade cards at the start. None makes for a boring game, while a single card per person often leads to one player having a clear advantage. The chances of getting 2 great cards are slimmer, so this seems to be a good medium. It also lends each player more of a unique 'character' to their bot.

Fun, but be very careful not to get too ambitious with your board layouts. 2 boards with 6 players, 3-4 checkpoints and 2 upgrades to start will be a fun (but still potentially unbalanced) 150-180 minute game.

As I recall, it was more fun for the theme and the bits than for the "programming your robot" game play.  And as I write this, it's been almost 4 years since I've played it.  In the meantime, I have played RAMbots (a similar game with Looney Pyramids), but it didn't bring back the nostalgia.  This is more a game I'll agree to play rather than a game I'll bring out.  Update (6/2011): Played it again, and the comments above are about right.

A race game that is complicated by the other players as well as the features of the board.  This game is about programming robots, and getting thrown off by being pushed in step 2 can really mess up your plans on steps 3-5 since you cannot change the program at that stage.  This can be a frustrating game for those who have difficulty visualizing what the intrauctions will do to their robot.

Didn´t like it very much. It has a long play time and I find the luck factor to be annoyingly high. I don´t think I will play this again soon.

Edit 2011-12-27

After much avoiding and deliberation, my friends managed to convince me to play this again and I’m very glad :D. This time I had a lot of fun.

I enjoy the simultaneous programmed movement mechanic and the game offers lots of laughs but BEWARE, don´t make the same mistake I did, play a small scenario with lots of opportunities to interact, otherwise you will begin to hate the downtime and the sameness of the game.

This is not a game for everyone, play before buy

Race your robot to get to the flags in the correct order. Play five movement/turn cards at a time in a "program" for the turn. All programs executed simultaneously. Robots push and shoot each other so your program may be interrupted.

Good interaction.  I've introduced over 20 people to this game and played with over 50, and I assure you every single one has at least found it ok, and of course most enjoyed it.  Make sure: (1) *Never* play on more than 2 boards  (2) Always have some trail crossing between targets.  Also, a "negative feedback scavanger hunt" house rule rebalances the leader for those who like to put the brakes on any early advantage.   In any case, best played with Armed and Dangerous. And personally there's three Options which we remove: Robocopter, Fire Control, Buzz Bomb.

Complex and chaotic, there's a great deal to like here, especially when using few boards and few flags.

Not as good as the original version.  I find the original rules using virtual robots to be much better than the start board in this one and the components are low quality, though not as bad as the 2016 edition, where the components are just really bad.

Too long for the number of players necessary to keep it from being multi-player solitaire.

can be a little demanding for the Eurogame crowd.  Game length is all in how you set up the board - from 60 minutes to nigh on impossible.  My favorite variant was a tag-team race with two robot teams.

Played a couple of games of this with just 2, and now with 4 and 5.  I so far I can say I've enjoyed it more with more players.  The game does get sort of "long" (as you add more players, play time increases) but there are lots of initial setups I haven't tried yet, and people seem to enjoy the chaos involved with robots shooting and pushing each other.

My rating went from 8.5 to a 9, and I expect it to stay there or go up as I try the different configurations out and actually become better at the game.

This game can be a little frustrating to start with... I have seen many times a robot stuck at the starting block going in circles.  But if you can get passed the initial false starts (learning curve), then this game comes to life. A fantastic group game as the more players and tighter the board the more fun this is... bumping into other people's robots and knocking them off course. Well worth learning and sticking with during the early days!!!

WotC '94, 1st ed.  Arrrgh!  What a delightfully frustrating game this is, especially for those of us who are spatially impaired.  The luck in the draw of the programming (movement) cards is balanced by the skillful use in making the most out of them.  I appreciate the fact that you can customize the game length and complexity to facilitate any level of play.  We play a lot of 2-player games using 1 board, 4 flag counters and 3 lives along w/ the deal-2-keep-1 option card variant at the beginning of the game.  Very happy to finally have this in our collection.

RATING: 10
Battle Bots comes to board gaming in this extremely fun adaptation. Chaos erupts into laughter as players sometimes confuse their own perspective of what's left and right with the one of the robot, all while near-simultaneous play and challenging board layouts offer exciting perils for your machine. It doesn't have enough of a combat mechanic for me, but I still love playing it -- and I have to give an extra bonus point for any game that comes up with a way to force slow players into catching up!

MEGA PLUS: thirty seconds left for the last player to choose their moves
BIG PLUS: huge entertainment factor, mental challenge
MINUS: one mistake can be costly, really more about planning

One of the games that got me into board gaming. Enjoyment will depend on a few things: 1)How well can you visualize the robots movement.Because those that can't picture where the robot will go tend to get frustrated. 2) How well the boards are set up. I'd play with 2 boards and 3 flags. Put the flags in reachable locations that are no more than two rounds from each other assuming a normal hand of cards. Those two things should keep games to an hour or so. Good solid game.

A game where you program your moves five turns at a time and hope that your programs pan out as you anticipated. With the conveyor belts, gears, lasers, and other robots bumping and shooting you - finishing five moves where you had planned to finish is more challenging than it sounds.

GREAT game with the right crowd. Lots of laughs bumping into each other and shooting each other up - sometimes on purpose, but often inadvertently. The game can feel out of your control at times and those who are overly frustrated by having their plans foiled may find this more maddening than fun. The variable maps and card draws can make the quality of the game sessions with this highly variable, but also ensures variety. It's a fun, solid design.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Two-Player [1 play]: 6.5/10 for the two-player version. It's more of a race at this point with less ways to injure your opponent or throw them off track. I'm betting I'd like it more with more players.  

3-player [1 play] Again, not a lot of robots running into each other in our game. 

Great concept, though. I bet it's great with 5 or 6 or more.

Juego curioso en el que manejas a un robot mediante la programación de sus movimientos.

El juego está bien, pero me da la sensación de caos absoluto, ya que el tiempo para programar tus movimientos es muy corto, el escenario es dinámico y va cambiando y además tus compañeros también se mueven. Puede resultar que programes una jugada y el resultado final sea totalmente el contrario.

Da la sensación de que las partidas se alargan demasiado, aunque me gustaría darle otra oportunidad.

Ugh!!   This is one of the games I really have a negative reaction when people suggest it.  Really don't like the randomness, and random chaos, of having to predict five moves in advance.  It's also real difficult to track what right or left turn will do when you have to factor in those tricky conveyor belts.  Would prefer to have a version where you have to plot just one move at a time; i.e., can you imagine Speed Circuit or Formula De where you would have to post five turns in advance?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Organised chaos. One game that definately improves the more players you have.

It's a race game, but don't expect Formula D.

Program your moves then watch in horror as they go horribily wrong.

Will appeal to fans of Galaxy Trucker and Space Alert. (But remember this came first)

Almost good enough to forgive Richard Garfield for magic the Wallet Cruncher.

Fun, Fun, Fun that's all this game is.  For me, it doesn't matter if your getting the shaft it's still fun.  The game greatly attends to my problem solving mind and you get a huge sense of satisfaction when your plans unfold the way you wanted them to.

However, we wary of a runaway leader

Update: This is probobly the most controversial game I own in that there almost always is a player or two who does not have a good time and then there are several who have a blast.  On our last play I had someone vow they would never play again.  As always, someone always dominates at the end and the race is never close.  I personally rate this an 8.5 regardless if a win or lose, but because so many people can get really frustrated with this game I have to take it down a point.

This was the most popular game with my non-gamer friends during the 90's. The programming mechanism works great and it's always big fun when somebody prefers eliminating other players to winning the game. The secret to enjoyable games is the right construction of the courses. Players have to criss-cross others on the way back, the number of boards should be tailored to the number of players. Early on, we made the mistake to choose as many boards as possible and lay them in a row. The result were lacklustre games of runaway winners/losers.

The visual challenge of this to a legally blind player like me is pretty close to a killer. I kept running into nigh-invisible walls. As with any programmed-movement game, it can be fun or frustrating depending on how thwarted you get and how long the game takes. A quick, say, Wings of War duel is fun; a long circling exercise in which no one can kill off the other isn't. Same with RoboRally. Add the general "challenges" of programmed movement to automatic laser firing, smaller hands of movement cards, and (with enough damage) some or all "frozen" maneuver cards, and my eyes start glazing over.

This game consists of alternating between two things I enjoy. First, making the best use of a set of movement cards. Then second, watching your plans go awry because of unexpected actions from the other players. I laugh a lot when playing this game.

Update: I've got a problem with the ramdomness in this game. It doesn't seem to greatly affect who wins, but it does seem to affect how long the game lasts. My last game went four hours, which is about twice what I was up for.

I wouldn't want to have too many players, and the player elimination is a major downside to this game.  I don't mind the randomness of the card draw - you have to make the best of what you're given.

I'm a little less than thrilled at the actual quality of the components for the recent printing (2009?).  

The "painted robots" look junky and badly done.  The stickers for the flag are a little...weird.  (Going to have to dig out a hobby knife to cut it so I can get one to go on the base without looking weird.

That being said, the actual gameplay is quite fun and is a nice change of pace from brainburners.  Sure, there's some thinking involved in movements and planning right, but the general lightness of the game keeps me from feeling too upset when I screw up.

Not everything needs victory points.  Sometimes it's just nice to have a game with robots with fricken lazers attached to their head.

Race to the checkpoint game with quirky robots. Game designed from Battle bots concept. Moderately challenging, entertaining game but [b]requires a good grasp of spacial abilities and planning. [/b]

I've seen a hand full of players who can't grasp the left from their right - not as easy as you think! Lack of mobility and randomization of the cards adds to [b]frustration[/b]. Getting several bad hands is very discouraging.

Overall, feels like progress is pretty slow, but [b]fun with chaos of 5+ players[/b].

A crazy game of programming robots to go left and right and not crashing into other robots! How can it not be good? There's lots of fun to be had, especially with more players and when everyone gets confused by their movements. Game length is unpredictable, but having the freedom to create your own courses is great.

Really enjoyed my first game of this (short as it was). The weight of the game seems heavier due to the computational aspect of it. The rules are actually pretty simple. The game is chaotic and actually planning out attacks on your fellow players is difficult. This makes it all the more enjoyable IMO. Given some moderately experienced players this game shouldn't take too long, however, some people just don't have the knack and it'll take them an age each round.
UPDATE: Programmed play is picked up by Space Alert, a country mile ahead of this slightly clunky game. I enjoy it but it takes too long comparatively. Dropped from 8 to 6

RATING: 9.5
One of my all time favourites.
I use some houserules to make it a better game (imho)
-If you die, just start at last checkpoint with 2 damage. -As a result we don't use powerdowns generally.
-You can't get out of the game.
-You have 1 minute after the first player puts down his cards.
-I only use the option cards sometimes because I think the game is chaotic enough without these cards.

-Use 2 boards at once max. Bigger playing fields doesn't mean more joy. Better go criss cross over a small area to get more player interaction.

Plays very well as a 2 player game.
Higher player counts (6+) only with experienced players.

A nice game, which does not require a lot of thinking and long explanation of the rules. Of course, the opponents can (on purpose or accidentally) screw you. But if this game is played knowing that, then this can give the players a lot of laughter and fun.

Smagus žaidimas, nereikalaujantis daug mąstymo ir ilgo taisyklių aiškinimo. Žinoma, varžovai gali (tyčia arba ne) labai pakenkti tau. Tačiau jei šis žaidimas žaidžiamas turint tai omenyje, būna daug juoko ir teigiamų emocijų.

This game is absolute chaos - if I dislike games with one simultaneous selection at a time imagine what I think of having five in a row. To make matters worse it is a racing game and the pain lasts two hours so the novelty wears off long before even your first game ends. It might appeal to some people based on theme but even that doesn't do a lot for me. One thing I have learned in my relatively short time with board games is that peoples' tastes differ - widely. Some people find chaos fun and that is perfectly valid. It's just not for me.

Fun, but a little slow.  Wouldn't recommend more than 2 boards though.  Also, can't help but feel that priority would be better served by a round robin system rather than comparing every register (it bogs down seriously with 5-8 players).Also, no need to shuffle every round, no need whatsoever.  But, a fun game nonetheless,

I enjoy chaotic games, as long as they are short.  This is chaotic and long.  The programming of the action cards is interesting, but half the time the player's plans are going to get ruined by someone else and they might as well just pick their cards randomly.  Also, even if there is a way to avoid getting your plans ruined, you probably will not even have the cards.

This was haha funny for the first 30 minutes, mediocre for the next 30 minutes, then terrible for the last 90+ minutes (with 7 players).

This disappointed me for some reason. I don't think it was because I had any trouble with the programming (I got a critical rule wrong in my first game, effectively lost several whole turns and still finished second out of five); it might have been to some small extent because I had expected a circuit race; but I think it's more that any interaction that took place was entirely random and having the robots carry out their orders just wasn't much fun. My second game (seven players!) was more fun (and I won), but it's still an exercise in chaos, and the random tech handouts are way unbalanced.

I recently purchased this in a charity shop because I played Robo Rally in the past (the dutch edition).

This version has room for a total of 8 players and brings in extra cards to upgrade your robot.

The cardboards are thinner thus weaker than the Dutch counterpart which is the only drawback. They get easily damaged compared to the other boards. Also it makes combining them a bit odd but ofcourse still possible. Who is up for a full weekend of Robo Rally. Lets get ready to RRRUUUUUUUMMMMBBBBLLLEEEE!!

Fun, but then it's disappointing when you realize that the game is most fun when robots are messing with each other, but to do well everyone pretty much knows to keep their distance from each other if possible, so for stretches of the game, I feel that we're all missing out on what should have been the fun part of the game.
Resist the temptation to make a big course; it will not be more fun, it will make go on too long, and decrease the interaction.

Rated after a single play with my wife. I can see the rating going up after more plays...especially with more people.

Update #1: I bumped the rating up from 7.5 to 8. After a few more games with my wife this is starting to grow on us. I think that RoboRally will be rated much, much higher if I ever get a chance to play with a bigger group!

Update #2: Nearly a year later and after a few more plays with bigger groups I've decided that I really don't like this game. You literally just spin in circles for hours. Up on the trade list it goes.

Update #3: Traded away. Good riddance.

Fun game about a race of robots in a futuristic factory. Has a good mix of planning and chaos.Each turn you lay cards to plan the movement of your little robot. Sometimes it can be pretty difficult to actually end up where you wanted to. A lot of the time something goes wrong because your planning wasn't that perfect (ooops you forgot about the conveyor belt? Well bad luck you get shot by a laser...) or because another robot pushes you around.
The remake has thrown out all rules that could potentially slow down the game - which i think overall is a good thing.

The classic game of programming your robot with moves in secret (with cards) and then everyone reveals and all robots move simultaneously and antics ensue!  A fun and zany game.

RATING: 3
This game has received more playtime than it probably deserves on account of the fact that it plays up to 8. Essentially this game works as a race, where people are often unable to do what they want (because movement is controlled by cards) and where no one gets to where they want to be because other players' turns affect what can be done.

Playing this game with 8 is a nightmare; I don't think I've ever gotten through an 8-player game of this without calling it at some point.

One key problem is that players with poor spatial awareness and sequential reasoning are going to get mauled all the time by this game and there's nothing that can be done about it. I personally stop having fun when 3 people are racing well against each other and one person is miserable and is just turning around in circles because their brain just can't visualize what's going on well enough. In addition because this game punishes taking a long time to take a turn (which is a good thing because otherwise turns would get very, very long) the least adept ends up getting wrecked from without and within the most.

I like robo rally a lot, mostly cause of the flavor and that I painted my own figs, giving me a chance to showoff.  The game BEGS to be customized in terms of how to lay out the board, how to assign upgrade stuff, and how to determine win conditions.  That, too me, makes this game worth it.  The rules given are simple (adding complexity is as simple as buying the expansions) and therefore give us the chance to make the game as we see fit.  When we played just the original game, straight rules, unfortunatly, once someone starts winning, it's hard to stop'em, but the game gives SO much room to create your own board, rules, upgrades, any "problem" in the game is IMO ultimately solvable, and maybe a game in and of itself.

RATING: 8.5
I really like the simultaneous action selection mechanic, and I think this game uses it nicely. And I don't have to deal with the wheedling you get in Diplomacy. This game really is at its best with a larger number of players. With 2, it is a race where the better cards will likely win, and there is likely to be very little interaction. The true fun of this game lies in robots crossing one another's paths.

Oh, a timer is a must. The rules say that after all but one player is finished, the final player gets 30 more seconds to put down his cards. Okay, fine, but if you have two really slow players, it's still way too slow. Better to use an electronic time programmed for a minute or so. Maybe 90 seconds for a more casual group. Really needed to keep the game moving.

I only wish the cards shuffled themselves each round.

Great game of [racing|programming|damage control]. I rediscovered this with the 2005 AH edition, having previously felt somewhat lackluster about it -- probably due to complicated courses and/or longwinded games. The sample setups included in the AH edition probably helps bringing about a more balanced game.

A good thing about RR recently pointed out to me is that even if your behind or in your own corner of the board, you still have a small optimisation problem to solve each turn programming your moves. This keeps each player occupied at all times.

I think playing with an at start option shakes things up a little, and adds to the fun.

Kudos to AH for re-releasing this!

(Update: Played the Wizards of the Coast version this weekend -- it does suffer from the "virtual" robots as well as from the lack of a timer & player mats. Still good fun, though. Give it a 7.)

Silly and chaotic are probably the two words that probably best describe "RoboRally".  You're forced to creatively maneuver using your cards, and are often hampered in your movement towards the goal.  Robots bump, shoot, and fly all over the board, while inducing quite a bit of laughter along the way.

Either you like this game or hate it. Some can think in the way recquired for successfull play; others can't. There can be a HUGE frustration factor if you don't get the cards you need.

There's a runaway leader problem as well.

That said, I have a great deal of fun playing. devising a great turn with crappy cards is the bomb!

This was love at first play! About 10 minutes into my first game, I looked over at my wife and said "I must have this game". Cards are "programmed" into your robot to try and guide them to tag the flags in order. The problem is that the other robots and the environment (a dangerous factory filled with all kinds of damaging and course-altering elements) will often disrupt or at least influence how your programming will turn out. This game has appeal for all ages and is extremely well-designed.

Avalon Hill reprint.  This game appeals to the programmer in me.  Reminds of computer games like CRobots and Omega.  Lots of fun trying to successfully navigate the robot to its objectives.

RoboRally is a mixed bag. I like the game if it's played as quickly as possible, with everyone likely to make serious mistakes on each turn. But if two players attempt to slow down play and cover all their bases the gameplay drags and the results become much less chaotic (and thus, much less enjoyable). Also, the game is seriously unbalanced in favor of those with a more acute sense of spatial orientation. The game is better with more players, and I'd say that with any less than five you should probably play something else. Still, the variety of maps and the quick, chaotic gameplay certainly make RoboRally fun.

Ebay purchase after playing it at Millennium with Rick.
Sold on BGG '10, maps are lame in new AH version and with gametableonline the board version is actually not as good.

I have the Ah version.  Better with more players, the markers are a tad cheap for the price, but the boards are nice, unfortunately a 4 board max unless you needlessly purchase more at I'm sure an extravagant price.

For some reason it hasn't been as fun as the first time I played, I think the old boards were better.

Quality rating: 6

Really unique race game that allows crazy things to happen outside your control.
Tons of fun though, but needs lots of players and the boards that come with the AH version are lacking imo.

Some people love Roborally, some people hate it. I think that it takes the right group in the right mood for Roborally to be fun, and it can be a pretty good game in the right setting. 

Part of the fun is the challenge of programming your robot, part of it is in the adventure of seeing what unfolds after everyone's moves are resolved.

Roborally is an incredibly chaotic game in which players must program robots to race through the most deadliest course ever.

Each player simultaneously programs five orders for its robot in secret, and then they are resolved. As orders are resolved, robots may push each other, not to mention there are all sorts of obstacles scattered throughout the board, such as conveyor belts, which will move robots around too. And here is where Roborally's fun resides: you must try to do your best with the order's you've been dealt, while keeping in mind both the board and other players.

The game is very chaotic and, at times, very luck driven, but it has an undeniable charm and, most of all, it's unique. While the meat of the game it's at the programming phase, it's when you are resolving orders where the fun is: seeing how robots race to victory or, on the other hand, rush relentlessly to their doom, is really fun.

The game is specially recommended for those who like thematic games and have tried to program a robot at some point in their lives. If you've ever goofed around with a Lego Mindstorm, you'll be surprised how well Roborrally captures the theme, while simultaneously adding layers of hilarity.

RoboRally has been described as a party game for geeks and I wholehearted agree with this statement. It is a fun game with lots of interaction and thoughtful planning. In RoboRally, you will try to be the first to move your robot across a number of checkpoints in a rather bizarre factory. During the race, you will have to use the conveyer belts to your advantage and avoid the negative effects of crushers, lasers and other robots. RoboRally is a great planning game, although you'll never be able to predict with certainty where your robot will end. Certainly avoid falling in pits! Instead, push another robot in a pit or even off the board ...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
An excellent and fun game where players use cards with instructions to "program" their robot tokens to move around the board, playing a "capture the flag" game with added lasers, crushing parts, moving conveyers, and death pits. The ability to customize the board to the group's challenge level and desired play time is nice, with suggested board layouts and extra mechanics included in the rulebook. The option cards allow for special bonus powers as well, changing up gameplay if the default mode isn't exciting enough.

Fabulous game. Quite frankly, it's ridiculous that some people complain that it's too long. That's like saying you don't want to jog because you have to go too far. You make the map as short or as long as you want! I don't know anybody who plays with the default scenarios.

Your task is to move one of the stupid little robots out on the factory floor through a series of checkpoints scattered throughout the factory. The wrinkle, however, is that the factory floor is filled with all kinds of inconvenient (if not down-right deadly) obstacles located in various locations: conveyor belts, crushers, flame-throwers, pushers, teleporters, oil slicks, pits, et cetera. But the real fun comes when the robots cross each other's path, and suddenly your perfect route is something less than that...

This is a great game for my engineering and computer science friends to get together and play.  The game can become a blow out if one robot manages to get separated from the pack.  To overcome this, our group adds a dummy robot that always spawns at the next flag that the leader is required to touch.  The control of this robot rotates around the table, this can slow the game down more but it keeps the leader closer to the rest of the pack and forces more mayhem.

I prefer it with as fewest boards as possible (one or two seems ideal with me), partnership teams of two a piece and hopefully under 90 mins. in length.  I don't like this one to drag on and on for a long game time but I do like it if it is under 90-minutes medium game.

I like both this game and its distant cousin Ricochet Robot. Unfortunately, most of my gaming group does not, so it doesn't get played as much as I like.

RATING: 7
Basically, I scored this game high because I enjoy a diversity of game mechanics.  This game's mechanism intrigues me in planning five steps ahead and the potential for being totally knocked off kilter by what others do in their preplanned moves.  Be sure to play this game with an egg timer that forces people to make decisions with their programming cards quickly or this game will likely drag.  While it plays 8 and comes with numerous boards, I would advocate for playing on 1-2 boards and 3-5 players to keep the game relatively short (And DON'T START with the complex looking boards!..:-) )

Während den Zügen schießen die Roboter gegenseitig aufeinander, das Brett befördert via Förderbänder die Roboter irgendwohin und geschubbst, getreten und gestoßen wird auch noch. Wer als erstes diesem Wirrwar entkommt, hat leichteres Spiel, da er sich nur noch mit dem Board konfrontieren muss, aber den Konkurrenzknäul hinter sich lassen kann.

Having played Colt Express and Kind of Air and Steam as predictive/programming games, this felt more chaotic than I was expecting, & easier to make mistakes whilst also finding it easier to predict opponents moves, albeit thinking that their intentions didn't give me much room to change my plans

RATING: 9
Easy to learn and both fast and fun to play - a real killer combo.

Both tactics and luck play a crucial role in winning, and if you don't concentrate, you'll just as soon end up killing your poor 'bot as catching a lucky break because your opponent expected you to zig when you zagged.

Oh, and the more, the crazier :)

This is the game that created our gaming group and really got us into boardgaming. Good brain exercise and lots of fun at the same time. It's really one of the rare games where you can enjoy when things go really bad for you (did someone just say ooops!?). It does have a runaway leader problem and a hopelessly-last problem AND games can take forever, but it's fun all the way. I have met people who totally hate it though. This review reflects the old edition.

After one play through I feel like its a little long, and you really need a group in the right frame of mind to enjoy the chaos.  I don't like having to figure out the turn order every time.  We figured out pretty late that if you're rotating then turn order doesn't really matter, that sped things up a bit.

My wife and I both really like this game... lucky I guess since about half our friends love it and the other half really don't. Something about the main game mechanic of trying to calculate what a series of simple operations combined with predictable factors (from the board) and less predictable factors (the other players)... such brain-bending tasks and the inevitable failures trigger some people's "fun" response and feels like the most frustrating kind of work to others.

This was one of my gateway games into Ameritrash, Eurogames, and everything else that's a level or more above Trouble. It's still fun, but I find that it's rarely as chaotic as the box advertises. If you want something fluffy but still kind of cerebral, this is a great choice.

The game doesn't appeal to me. It's quite chaotic and many things (e.g. player elimination) happen by sheer bad luck. For instance in the first game 5 out of 7 players did not finish the race and the last two decided to end the game so that it doesn't drag on while others sit idly.

I understand why this is so popular but I just can't bring myself to raise it to that vaunted level. Sure, it's fun, but its TOO chaotic. I love simultaneous movement selection as a mechanic but it misses something that other SM games have. The game becomes much more fun to play once you and your friends have a few drinks.

Also, kids love this game and it's been great fun to introduce this to a Games Club that I started at my son's elementary school.

first time we played with 4 or 5 and it was great. played quick and flowed smooth. I died at some point but i still liked it a lot. 
Last time we played was with 8 players and the resolving was so slow and everyone kept bumping into each other so no one got anywhere. It was horrible, long and basically torture. 
I loved it with 4 and would discourage to play with 8.

RATING: 5
This game is pretty chaotic, but not so much that you can't plan and predict what opponents can mess you up, as you can generally tell who is close enough to push you around. The real time aspect is more to get rid of AP than actual real time. I like the laser/damage aspect of the game as it adds interaction/adds an additional layer of strategy, but overall the bumbling, trundling feel this game provides is not my cup of tea.

RATING: 7
This game is very fun. But I thought it was possible to have more control. You really depend on the cards that are dealt to you. It's sometimes possible to "solve" the puzzle of moving where you want to. I need to play more to see if the fun of the game is worth the lack of control.

I think this game could lend itself to league play. By adding an experience system (for kill, for life left, for flags touched) to buy options.

This is quicly becoming one of the favorite game of my girlfriend. It's quick to explain to new player. When you lose it's never your fault and when you win you can show off :)

A solid game.  It's obvious why it's been touted as a classic for so long (although MtG probably has better legs).  I really liked the programmed aspects of the game, which I found rewarding when I succeeded and educating when I failed.  There's probably more chrome tacked on than is necessary and the game can run longer than desired, but a fun time for a wide range of player numbers.

This game has the advantage of being novel, you must plan your moves beforehand by choosing from a subset of 9 randomly dealt cards.  The not cool thing is that there's a lot of dealing that goes on.  It's not too interesting beyond the novelty of the implementation.

I have had a lot of fun with RoboRally and horrible experiences with RoboRally.  Some games I have played are chaotic fun, where everyone has a great time.  Others have dragged on way over an hour where you a bored to tears.  It is very much a function of how you setup your maps and keeping them small.  

Also, it is not a bad idea to deal out a special ability at the start.  

I must admit the bad outweighs the good.  It can be fun but when offered, I almost always ask to do something else.

I really wanted to like this game.  It is an interesting game in concept, but seems to have a tendency to drag when it really needs to stay fast-paced to maintain interest.  Only played with 3 and it seems to need at least 4 to play well.  Worth another shot, but not sure it will get it.

Dragon Delta or Wings of War fill this programmed-chaos niche for me.  They are simpler, faster and more fun.

If this is accurate, then it is not likely to get played too often.

Still uncertain if this is worth getting. Maybe try online at Gleemax.

This is excellent - although it can get booring with continous play.  It's right on the border between party-/casual-/gamers-game.  Fast paced and some strategy, but you need some luck with the command-cards.

This is a fun, albeit chaotic game. In our first play, we devised a course of our own (2 flags) but the game lasted hours. Needless to say we'll stick to courses from the manual for a while to keep the game length in check. There can be a runaway leader problem, though this could potentially be alleviated by designing courses with a lot of back-and-forthing.

Very nice game which pleases experienced gamers just as much as non gamers.

As a computer-geek one just has to like this one. It's great entertainment to watch peole try to figure out where their cards may bring them by twisting and turning themselves.

Light and chaotic, this seems like it should be a fun game, but a major flaw kills it for me (severe runaway leader problem). One player randomly is less screwed up by others at the start, and once ahead they get uninterrupted movement, while everyone else is hindered by being amongst others in the pack.

So after a quarter of the game time, you know how things are going to turn out, its boring playing as the leader because you just run for the goals without much interaction, its frustrating playing as anyone else because nothing they can do can effect the outcome.

Its a shame because I like the mechanics of it.

Great fun. The programming is easy to understand being a science minded type, and the game is quite easy to scale depending on how long you want to play for. Most enjoyable (I feel) with numerous players, lots of options, several boards and lots of flags, which tends to generate satisfactory chaos. If you position the flags right (crisscrossing back on each other), you can avoid runaway leader problems. Destructive havoc is always fun.

Quirky racing game that guarantees unintentional (and some intentional) mayhem. Hasn't gotten a lot of playtime lately due to some members of our gaming group having trouble telling left from right. (hint: it's the hand that makes an "L").

Own the original version plus expansions, bought when it first came out due to Richard Garfield fandom.  Played this game to death for years, have used the boards in RPG games, and generally just love this game.  Cards are extremely worn and need to be replaced.  Sister was famous for getting her right/left confused and then driving robot into all kinds of trouble.  Now-husband was famous for 'sit and spin' on double wrenches so that he could go after us with a souped-up robot.  Won a Roborally tournament at a game convention (Egyptian Campaign? in Carbondale IL, I think), won a Roborally T-shirt and wore it to death.

Fun puzzly game with lucky card draw elements.  Benefits include: 1) game length is determined by players; 2) tons of boards and flag options mean endless variety; 3) plays 8 just as well as 5.

A fantastic game. I always tell people that they should expect to die and welcome it with laughter, I also tell them that it is possible for no one to win. The game is full of mayhem and disaster no matter how well you plan things out. The game is also much more fun in terms of playing in a shorter timeframe and having far more laughs with the implementation of one house rule. Instead of flipping the timer when there is one player left programming, flip the timer when the first player has finished programming.

Although this game can take over 3 hours depending on how big you make the board, the number of checkpoints and each of the checkpoints distance from one another, it is still a fun silly game.

The aim is to have fun even if that means shoving someone else in a pit or crusher. Most games aren't completed but it is clear who has won by that point.

Still one of my favorites - with a lot of players, one has to place the flags carefully (and possibly use some house rules like shields around the flags) to prevent leader breakaway, but apart from this, it's flawless. We play with a time limit of 3 min for programming.
Played 50+ times.

Don't really care for this one.  Just too chaotic, and too much rides on the luck in the cards drawn.  Fun theme and idea, and can be funny with the right company, but there are several other games I'd rather play.  I will say the "programming" of your robot, trying to take everything into consideration, including conveyor belts, lasers, and all that is fun... but you just never know who's going to get the best cards and if other players are going to bump into you.  If everyone had their own map, and were given the same set of cards, and it was a race to see who can best use their cards given the pressure of the timer - I think I'd like that a bit more.  Just me though.  I know people who love this game.

The only problem, as I see it, with this game: playing with girls.  Whenever I play a game there is usually a girl at the table, and the spacial awareness (left and right) involved in this game is usually too much for them.  Sorry if that sounds sexist.  To be fair, this statement applies just as much to the guys if there has been sufficient alcohol consumed!

RATING: 9
Roborally is one of those bipolar Love/Hate games. Either you enjoy the chaotic/unpredictable gameplay that can ruin your best laid plans or you get frustrated and every game is a infuriating test of your patience. Fortunately I include myself in the former group and think that Roborally is a great way to spend a few hours with some friends or family. The key (IMO) to appreciating the game is to ignore the board set-up in the rules and play 1 board per player (up to 4 boards max) and place flags so that paths have to cross. Armed and Dangerous adds more death and destrucution (adding length), while the other expansions give more board options to deal with (can add length as well but some also speed play depending). 

I think the point at which you really start enjoying the game is at what I call, the "Aha!" moment. This is where the programming becomes second nature to you. The more you play, the more familiar with the boards and the way that they will interact with your robots. Up until the point where all of that is 2nd nature, the game seems really luck driven. The reality couldn't be farther from the truth however. Once you can program your robot and KNOW where it will end up and which direction it will be facing, you can program your robot to do almost exactly what you want it to do. I say almost as the other players certainly will have a say in it at some point. But good programming skills can keep you out of 80% of harm's way. At some point you realize you are no longer confused or surprised when you move your robot, and it's that point where you go...Aha! Get a group that are all skilled in programming and you'll be amazed at some of the things that happen.

Of course even the best laid programs go awry, but the difference is not through your ineptitude, but through the better program of an opponent.

My group loves this game. We never play with more than 3 boards or 4 flags and the games take about 2-3 hours. Oh and btw....it's a SIN to play with unpainted Robots!

Although I like playing this game, the challenge of the imperfect navigation fits my skills. But in my experiences by turn 4 to 5 one person is so far ahead there is no point finishing the game.

Incredibly fun game.  The most often heard complaint is that it takes too long to play but many of the people I have talked to that complain this also say they are playing with 6+ flags on as many boards.  Keeping the number of flags and, more so, boards reasonable makes the game faster and helps keep one player from gaining an early, unassailable lead.

Almost everyone I have ever introduced this game to absolutely loves it.

Chaotic but can be fun. Gameplay is a bit on the long side depending on how you set up the flags. It has potential to have runaway leader issues.  The new edition drastically needs better robots (in different colors).  It is more fun when you ratchet up the tension by starting the timer at the beginning of the turn and giving everyone only 30 seconds to program!  A game that I would play on a sporadic basis and only with a larger group.

RATING: 8
Mad fun as you try to program your robot to race around a course and reach the targets before your opponents, all the while dodging their lasers and the boards own dangers.  The random nature of the card draw for the programming means there is an big element of luck involved, but in a way, that is part of the fun and in fact there is much fun to be had from watching everything go wrong and your robot spin out of control...  Excellent multi-player fun.

If played on too many boards, this game can drag on a bit.  But with only a couple boards (or even just one board with 2 players), there can be a fair amount of strategy, a good bit of take-that, a few moments of "oh, crap!" and a lot of laughs.

RoboRally is the poster child for making chaos into a game mechanic, and making it delicious. It's like no other game I've ever played.

An old family favorite.  The programmer in me has always enjoyed the chaos caused by bugs in the bots.

Part of the rating is nostalgia at this point.  The game really can be frustrating at times - especially when you draw cards that don't provide any ability to move whatsoever.

Complete, uncontrolled chaos and destruction with attendant comedy and entertainment value.

I usually don't cackle uncontrollably at the misfortune of others, but I sure do when playing RoboRally. Something about the way someone's carefully laid plans fall apart brings out the evil in me.

To be sure, the game isn't perfect - the game can go way too long for one thing - but it is something of a classic. What I find wildly original isn't so much the programmable movement as it is the use of the timer to force people to play quickly and send their robot out without fully calculating the consequences of their plans.

It's amazing to me that the same genius who made this game also made the abomination known as King of Tokyo...

RATING: 3
While I can see the apeal in a Rube Goldberg sort of way there's far too much chaos for me. The damage mechanic is particularly punitive and eventually forces you to actually skip your turn (power down). If you get an early lead you can usually keep clear of most of the trouble and cruise to a victory. This is painful for the players who are tangled up with each other constantly getting pushed off of their intended paths and exchanging lasers. The upside of this runaway leader problem is that the game actually ends otherwise it's just stuck in an infinite DO-loop.

My girlfriend really likes this game, but I think that's because she always beats me.
This is one game where the randomness of the cards doesn't seem to detract from the overall strategy, as you usually end up heading in the correct direction anyways.

Strangely I missed this game until recently. Seems fun, but I can't stand the randomness of the card draw. Even at Draw 10, play 5 you can get screwed so bad as to make the next 30-45 minutes painful. I'd like a house rule of trade 3 to 1 or something. 
Otherwise goofy fun with some basic programming thinking. and robots!

The cute and charming aesthetic of this game hides a vicious cutthroat experience that will test the strongest of friendships. The simple idea of racing robots across a factory floor is made interesting with a pre-programmed movement mechanic that requires a bit of forethought. The miniatures are begging to be painted as the sculpts are good but the silver look is a little hard to read.

What a stinker of a game! I am generally tolerant of most games, but can't stand this one and will likely never play it again after only 2 plays. Why? Too much thought required for tense planning of moves, only to have it really not matter at all, since one bump from an opponent sets you off on a random course which most likely ends in doom. Add to this the huge weak-player syndrome, which ensures that newbies like me will never play again after getting smoked by veterans (i.e. anyone whose played it more than once); way too much chaos for way too long of a game; plus player elimination. Boo! My wife can't stand this one either :(

RATING: 8
Played 9 times.
Last play was Sept 23, 2007.

This is a fun game.  It is a little random on how things go, but it is full of suprising moments.  More players is better.  This game takes a little practice, but even when you know what you are doing you can still get messup pretty good.

Last night we played a team game of pure carnage... no flags.  The teams were randomly chosen and ended up being a little unbalanced (first turn my partner went into a pit with out any help from anyone else.)  The game also took a long time and my partner and I ended up with only 1 life point left while the only one player on the other team had lost even one life point, by the time my partner had to leave, so the last turn we both programed our robots to commit suicide by jumping into pits.  But it was fun, we just learned a few thing to make next time play better.  Like either handicaping one team (less life points?) or starting with fewer life points to begin with to make the game quicker.

Runs a little bit long for a chaotic, fun game for laughs. Card draw is very important but random, and the starting position is not balanced. The rules could use a trim too for this lighter game.

This one is hard to rate. The interaction during the game is as fun an experience as I have had. The table talk, pushing your opponents off the board, shooting powered down bots with your "ass" laser, and making sound effects are an awesome way to spend the evening. However, the game play is slightly dull. Unless everyone is piled up screwing each other's programing, the only goal is to find the quickest route using your 5 cards - BORING. It is really the only game I played where winning is the boring part. So, I don't love the mechanics, the experience is boring, but the interaction is awesome.

Hard for me to get enough people together to play this. It lasts longer than it should. Front runners tend get away uncontested, missing the interesting part of the game, which is all the robots messing each other up in the middle.

Watching people twist and turn is always great fun.  This game plays better with a speed element.  When the second last player selects their cards everyone starts counting to ten.  If the last player doesn't complete their turn the robot is programmed randomly.

RATING: 8
This is a game I fell into by accident. The theme did not appeal to me; I hated the idea of "programmed moves" (there's history there, but I won't go into it); the quality of components is far inferior to what you'd expect to find in a European game - Avalon Hill's component quality is pretty shocking, to my mind. 
I had long resisted the temptation to play RoboRally, yet this is one of the best games I've played for a balance of interaction, personal tactics and speed. It's phenomenally easy to teach and play, but fiendish in its complexity - by which I mean, anyone can use their cards to move, but it takes skill and planning to minimise card use, and make your available hand fit the moves you want to make. Yes, there's the luck of the draw, but it heightens rather than detracts from the planning. A successful move gives you a rush, and the sand timer piles on the pressure.

I am always willing to be converted, and this game has won me over. A solid 9, right from first play. Genius (with the caveat that, with a full complement of 8 players, this is probably chaotic to the point of being unplayable).

Fast and chaotic racing/programming game where your piece's movement over the hazardous-filled board is laid down five steps in advance under time pressure. The best laid down plans are naturally foiled as one's mistakes and the opponents' movements interfere with the program that still must be performed in spite of the new situation, with almost certain catastrophe and hilarity in consequence. Medium-high degree of direct player interaction and medium session times of about 90 minutes for five players.

This is fun except that (in our play group) very quickly one robot breaks away from the pack and never looks back. It's somewhat more fun if you have an "over and back" race, giving the bots in the back another crack at shooting the leader, but still after a while we felt like the randomness (or player failures) was too much.

RATING: 8
This is a wonderful casual game which I thoroughly enjoy playing.  The humor and silliness of the game make it very enjoyable without requiring too much heavy thinking, and the constant player interaction makes for some hilarious encounters.  It's not without its flaws as the board often gets crowded with more players and it suffers from player elimination, but I'm more than willing to look past those for some extremely entertaining gameplay.  It's a great game to introduce to non-gamers and a wonderful break from more serious games.  Everyone I know enjoys this game, although it's been quite a while since this one hit the table.

I primarily play short games of this with co-workers at lunch and it's always a blast.

We have yet to finish a single game of RoboRally.  We have tried a few times and always give up a few hours in and declare someone the winner so we can play a much more fun game. At first the game looks super fun, programming the silly little robots around a maze trying to get flags and shoot the other little toaster like robots, but its no good. There are much better programming games out now (not a genre I particularly enjoy anyway)

Played this with some 11-year olds and they thought it was OK fun.  It just didn't catch my particular fancy.  Maybe it's because it's so slow-paced, compared to a comparable vidgame like "Bomberman."  Whacking the other robot was more a result of happy accidents, rather than proper planning.  I prefer my wild mayhem be more direct and responsive, and not so hinged on the luck of the draw.  As a similar card mechanic, I much prefer "Wings of War" for it's stream-lined simplicity.

The basic game mechanics have _so_ much potential. It's disappointing to see them get bogged down in the tremendous amount of complex cruft that has been grafted on.

I want to like this game more. It would seem to be right up my alley. And when I start playing it, I'm always saying to myself how much fun it is. BUT, then the crunch for Flag 1 happens, it takes 45 minutes just to clear it, and then the players who get passed the flag first sail away into the sunset with everyone else in their rear view mirrors while they zoom away unhindered. In the two games I've played, the game takes a little bit too long, and the leaders run away from everyone else leaving the other players with little to no chance to catch up. For theme and mechanics, I give this a 10. For length and runaway leader problem, I give it a 5.

                                                   Designer/German games. Despite being a long, and to many people, complicated

                                                   they, and the main game, went out of print in the US. I highly recommend this game,
                                                   especially to those with a technical bent. I haven't played it much recently (4 times in

I wish I liked this more.  The chaos sounds fun in principle, but it is too long for a race game and mistakes/interference only make it longer.

I picked up Duck, Duck, Go! and it's short enough and simple enough that I think it replaces RoboRally.

RATING: 6
A very fun game with lots of interesting twists.  I dislike the race aspect of the game because it makes for games where one person gets so far ahead that the rest must just play "catch the leader."  I much prefer to play variants like Capture the Flag or King of the Hill to encourage more robot interaction.  The best play variants are those that encourage team play.

Very fun game with lots of mayhem. My only beef with it, however, is that the time it takes to play a full game seems to increase dramatically as the number of players increases. A 3 player game can be finished up in as little as an hour or two. 5 or 6 players, however, might take as long as 4 to 5 hours!

Ugh. I program computers during my day-job, why would I want to play a game around that?? Long downtime (I'm usually done way ahead of everyone) and sometimes-unbearable randomess makes for a package I'd much rather avoid. Plus the game can take literally forever to complete.

Tanga buy.  Played with my game group.  It was a blast but I fell into the pit three times and was out of the game in like 10-15 minutes (my own fault).  I'll be more careful next time and I still thought it was fun.  
Just doesn't get played.

Played Hasbro reprint of Richard Garfield's first big game.  High production values and okay gameplay.  Very much into 'programming' sequences of steps, but expecting havok from interaction with other players.  Not a 'strategy' game per se, and I see how some people would enjoy this a lot.  Would not always want to play it, but could use it to kill time.

Own the new AH edition. Component-wise, I think the box is oversized, with no inserts. The boards and cards could be done with a better quality paper. The game itself is brilliant, a great brain exercise. My only problem with this game is that luck can play an important role. In a recent game I received 9 orders: 8 to go forward. While this is FRUSTRATING, it is fun - at least for the other players. :)

I like the theme very much, programming my robot etc. The game really shines with more people, as you get in each others way, programs get wonky, best laid plans, that sort of thing. But its also where it starts to bog down, with having to make sure everyone goes at the right time. Think my rating may go up with a few plays now that we have corrected a rule misunderstanding. Where are my Highlights magazines to better my reading comprehension?

Ah, mayhem. Met expectations: chaotic, which I'm not always going to want, but lots of replay value with the different boards, and I'm certainly interested in understanding the game well enough to know what makes a good course. Clear that choice of course can have significant impact on the level of  interaction (not to mention mayhem). Even works with two.

Play with a reverse timer rule (a mistake from someones video review that seemed like a good idea).  When the first person is done setting up their moves, flip the timer (instead of when one person is left).

The fighting rules rarely come into play unless you have many players, and too much of the ruleset and learning curve is on the virtual-bot case, which represents a very small percentage of play.

This is a pretty fun game, but it doesn't have enough social interaction. The game time is divided between simultaneous action selection and resolution phases. During the simultaneous action selection phase, everyone is busy and no one is talking. The resolution phase is rather tedious and everyone is concentrating to make sure it's executed correctly.

I love this game. The planning of using your programming cards to ensure that as well as benefiting you it has the opposite effect on your opponents is very challenging but enjoyable.

RATING: 6
Pick sequential orders to first move your robot to the finish line.

Plays: A couple.
Type: Thematic race game – a theme-driven game where you race to be the first across the finish line.
Complexity: Medium.
# of players: See BGG.
Playing time: Depends on the race and the number of players.
Player interaction: Racing. Conflict. 
Randomness: High - card draw.

Replayability: Low. This is very much an "in the mood" game. Once in a while is enough.
Fun: This is designed to be fun above all. The decision making under time pressure is fun. The spatial thinking is fun. Particilarly when you get it wrong and your poor robot runs into a laser. Or a pit, or off the board. Or when some other robot pushes yours onto a conveyor belt, completely screwing up your program for the rest of the turn, leaving you far, far from where you wanted to go. No other game is as much fun when things go wrong. Sometimes it's even fun when things go right! Strangely though, this is most fun when you fail spectacularly.
Memorability: Pretty high, the hapless robots and their failures are quite inspiring.

Thematic integration: Theme rules over mechanisms here.
Components: Good.

Who will like this: Strategy gamers that enjoy the theme and want a laugh.

Ah, Robo Rally. The game that started it all for me. My first game was 8 players, 7 of them new, and started at 1 in the morning. Hysterical, chaotic bliss. This is actually a game I think is better the worse you are at it- once you master getting around in the game it devolves a bit into a fairly straight-forward rally. However, clever flag placement or house rules can fix that (Brad and I play football-style every now and then, four robots on a side, one dedicated flag-tagger and the rest running interference). I still love it though, and will gladly play it in whatever form whenever I can.

Picked up in a mathtrade... 

Tried for the first time tonight with my son - a hysterical, laser blasting, shoving pushing, exploding, moving, turning racing time. One of the most fun game sessions I've had in a while, and I played a bunch of games earlier in the day preceding this one.

Several unrecorded plays of this. My problem, I think, is that I just don't care for these games where I program my moves, and then spend the second half of every round sitting there watching the outcome passively without any control.

That, combined with the ridiculous game-length makes this a game that hasn't seen the table in quite a while. Not even the kids enjoy it.

Actually own the newer edition but didn't see it on the list. The fun level of this game is largely tied to how fast/slow they folks are that you're playing with. With fast players, this can approach a "10". With slow players, the game can take forever. Yes, they have the timer but that seems to just lower the fun rather than speed up play.

It's robots!  Moving across a booby-trapped map!  There are lasers and drills and battering rams, oh my!  What could go wrong?

Well . . . quite a bit, actually.  For my money, RoboRally does so very many things right - fantastic art, great design, lots of variety and replay value - but then stumbles into a major, if not exactly fatal, flaw.  

One of my most important metrics in evaluating a non-cooperative game - and I recognize many others may simply not feel this way - is how well it engages the player(s) who is losing the worst.  Does the last place player feel the compulsion to press on, grasping at the slim chance of victory, or out of sheer enjoyment?  Or does s/he just feel like participation is a waste of time?

RoboRally falters badly on this score.  Simply put, if you get off to a bad start in this game (which can happen due to your own incompetence, opponent machinations, or random chance), you might as well pack it up.  I've never played a game that is more punishing for its lagging players, with the possible exception of Diplomacy.  Moreover, because you simply respawn upon dying, you can never simply die with dignity (or hilarity).

When a game of RoboRally is going well, it can be tremendous fun - it is intense without being tense, competitive without being hostile.  But when it goes badly, which happens all too often, there is too broad a "spread" between the front of the line and the back of the pack to make it enjoyable.  That flaw bars RoboRally from the ranks of the regular favorites.

'Program' your robots moves in advance and then reveal and carry out those moves as you race to clear the checkpoints and get to the finish amongst all the factory floor obstacles including conveyor belts, pits and lasers!

The predetermined movement is a genius idea, and makes for a fair but often accidentally violent game. Good fun, but plays best with 4+ players (which sadly stretches the game on for TOO long).

Quite a bit of deck strain with 5+ players- almost every card must be used per draw- without sleeves my cards have quickly worn out.

Also shame AH didn't re-make the expansions...

Lastly I've found as my games group changes so does like for this game- certain players find RoboRally boring and frustrating to various degrees which naturally spoils my experience as well.

This game can drag out exponentially depending upon course size/difficulty, and although its fun for an hour its sucks when you are still not half way through after 3 hours!

The timer is also a double-edged knife- sure it cuts out  AP players dragging on the game for even longer, but they will also despise the game with a vengeance! I have a gamer who is AP prone but also doesn't like pressure mechanics in games- he had barely decided on two cards by the time the timer had ran him out every turn and he hated it to the point of sapping the fun for everyone.

Completely inferior to the more recent edition.

Played this when it first came out, then lost track until I acquired a cheap Hasbro edition. All the familiar hallmarks are there, but will chaos overwhelm the game?  We had one experience player who carried both games, but the rest of us floundered, some only getting one flag and others none at all.  Obviously it takes talent, but is it too frustrating for casual players even considering the laughs? More plays will tell.

Fun chaos for about 45 minutes then it drags due to crappy card draws for most players. The map needs to channel robots back through a central spot so that the laggards can shoot the leader. Needs the right group to see it as a crazy race rather than a serious competition.

Great game.  Program your robots to move around a maze and get pushed around by other players and conveyer belts.

The 'programming' of your robot is a nice idea - that it gets glitches when bashed is even smarter.  }:o)

My inner Richard Garfield fanboy kept me interested in RoboRally longer than I should have been. Basically the game has 3 issues that simply don't meet my current standards: it's unpredictably chaotic (as in "you're trying to program stuff with a random hand of cards against other random hidden hands of cards"), suffers from a sluggish pace and tends to develop an early runaway leader (or loser).

I own the Avalon Hill reprint. It's the only version I've ever played, but I love it already. Played maybe five times as soon as I got it out of the box. I love how- and why- the timer is used.

Very cool board game which plays very fast once you get the hang of it. The execution is simple and is fun with a lot of players. I like the programming of the robots and working with the board to reach the flags. Well worth it as long as you don't have analysis paralysis people (which they included a timer to combat this yeah!), or people who just can't program their robots and complain about how stupid their moves are. Simple in execution but very fun nonetheless.

RoboRally is a fine game, and it definitely has some really good qualities.  I like the simultaneous move planning, and I like that it can play with a wide range of players.  The upgrade cards are a good touch, though I wish they were easier to get, and the ability to customize maps is always a plus.

But I just don't find myself enjoying this game as much as I think I should.  Perhaps its that your control over movement is on such a fine level that the progress comes really slowly.  Or perhaps it is that despite the fine control, you are really at the whim of the cards and it is actually quite difficult to go where you want to.  I don't have any trouble visualizing how the board will effect me, so it is only the cards that seem to thwart me.  I don't mind playing RoboRally, but I wouldn't pull it out unless there were a lot of players.

RATING: 4
While it has a cute theme and I want it to just be tons of fun, there is a surprising amount of skill to play. This means that  better players will quickly out pace poorer players. Our group almost always winds up ranking in the same positions barring terrible card luck. While cards are meant to add some randomness, they can just wind up frustrating as you never feel 'lucky' just unlucky. Game play improves with more players as some is more likely to be doing worse than you. Also supposed to be better drunk (which knocks skill component down) but irrelevant for our group.

The bots are cute, but there is no actual difference in game play between them (you could replace them with meeples) making it somewhat pointless.

While this game is supposed to be chaos and anything can happen, in reality its a game of bad cards and spacial manipulation.

One of Richard Garfield's games before Magic.  Preplan moves for your robot (move forward, left, right, backward, turn, etc) and attempt to reach objectives before your opponents. Weapons allow you to shoot or push other robots around.Some neat concepts, but the idea of pre-planned moves, then collisions with other robots, getting your robot shot in the back (though it has some appeal) gets quickly chaotic. I could stomach a short scenario, but a game that took 4 hours, with one person gaining better robot abilities really turned me off the game.

This game always seemed like it should be great fun, but there's something missing for me. I love the mechanism of programming your move, and that taking damage 'locks' your moves so that you need to compensate. 

When we played, though, it never felt like a satisfying competative game. We found that the player who got out in front just kept their lead and won. We tried out all sorts of double-back tracks and house rules to try and keep the leader down, but it just didn't seem to work.

I guess others may have had a different experience with it, but for me this one always remained perplexingly unsatisfying.

A chaotic game that can be a lot of fun with many players (especially six or more). This game is very unique compared to all other boardgames I have played; movement program cards are selected in order and then everyone reveals to see where each robot ends up. Can go for too long if the robots are not interacting or the board is too big.

I was given this game for my birthday and we played it all weekend long. We were able to include my nephews with only the slightest moderation to rules and everyone had a blast.

After a couple plays, we decided to let everyone randomly select an Option card at the start of the game to give each player a little something special/different. 

And I'd never be forgiven if I didn't mention that, yes, in one game we were all soundly beaten by my 5-year old nephew.

I've played games that were worse from a purely technical standpoint, but on a gut level, no game has aroused as much loathing and revulsion in me as this ultra-chaotic, headache-inducing nightmare.  The special weapons are unbalanced, there's a colossal runaway loser problem, you can sit and rotate all day long because you never get dealt any move cards, and it's well within the realm of possibility for a player to get eliminated 20 or 30 minutes into a game that goes on for another hour, or more.  The only blessing is that you can legally commit suicide and remove yourself from the agony.  There is absolutely no way I will ever play this again.

Way too chaotic for my liking. Going into it, I thought it was supposed to be a serious, heavy game... my mistake. You have so little control over your actions if there are any opponents in your vicinity that you will do just as well randomly selecting your actions (which I proved several times in the game I played). Also, the powers, at least in the new version, are ridiculously unbalanced. The power that lets you get within one square of the flag (even diagonally!!!) should be removed for sure. A few others are way too powerful as well, and the lucky player that gets any of them can just run away with the game. After a few rounds, when I realized how completely random and silly the game was and I started playing for pure fun, I started to like the game better. I'd gladly play again, especialy knowing what I know now, but I doubt I would ever request it, and the original version with the expansion I found at a Savers for $2.00 is going to go on eBay soon! :)

Scott owns this. We set it up really really badly when introducing some people to it and then spent 2.5 hours trying to get to the first marker before giving up. That was like two years ago and we haven't gotten it out since.

Chaos, chaos and chaos. I have a hard time separating left and right in my every-day life, and this... Well, it not a game for serious gamers, who want no disturbance in their plans. This is the exact opposite. Don't expect anything to go according to plan. I love this game! (And so does my wife!!!) It's a good laugh. Just don't play it after a bad day at work.

RATING: 3
I hate it - played it once, and I'm definitely not going to play it again. I found it extremely boring, and the only good thing I can say about it is that it allows you to drop out of the game without impacting the other players (which I did, after playing for more than two painful hours, with no end in sight).

RATING: 10
One of only three games in my collection that deserves the perfect '10'!

Hillarious theme and absolutely fantastic mechanics. The Movement Cards add a touch of randomness that make sure the game will never get repetetive no matter how many time you play. Everything still depends on the skill of the players though.
You program you robot 5 moves at a time, trying to avoid the dangers of the boards, as well as the other players.
Game gets better with each player you add, yet doesn't increase down time, since all players program and move their robots at the same time.

RATING: 5
A game for player enragement.  One can plan out and program your robot perfectly, then a knucklehead will mess up his play:  "oh I didn't mean to play that program card!".  So their robot is now in the way and obstructing you. I burned my copy in total disbelieve.

I play this on and off, and I absolutely love the game. However, I don't feel I've played it enough to actually give it a thorough rundown. When I have, I'll get back to you.

You have to build the map properly. It has to be built in such a way that people who are trying to get to the first flag can still much with people going for the third or even fourth.

That said, my ONLY complaint about this game is the life system. Of course, the only issue here is that it really only affects new players, which is the sad thing. Once you have an idea of what you are doing and how to go about it, you shouldn't lose more than a single life in a game.

RATING: 5
Everyone controls their own robot by placing 5 cards in their 'control banks' that vary from 'turn left', 'turn right', 'move forward one space' etc.  Everyone takes turns moving their robot with the goal of the game to get their robot to touch the different flags in order.  

With 5 or more players, the board gets really crowded.  With the nature of robot movement, how robots push each other and get in each others' way, it makes any strategy you have, inconsequential.  The game is fun, but for how chaotic it gets, Roborally tends to overstay it's welcome.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It's a grid-based race game like Regatta with a pre-planned algorithm twist (a la Space Alert), two of my least favorite subgenres/mechanics. I think I dislike race games because they can last a long time (if the goalposts are difficult), the turns can get repetitive, it's chore-work-challenging (rather than fun-challenging) to keep track of your directional facing and directional movement, and they are boring. Nevertheless, this one is the best I've played so far in that genre.

Chaotic and fun. Don't be too serious with this one. The official rules are a bit broken, but with a bunch of house rules this is really good. The bad thing is that the game last a bit too long.

RATING: 6
Enjoyment of this game, more than any in my collection, is dependent on the players.

There is a line in personal involvement in any game.  Somewhere between "invested in the game/win" and "not taking it too seriously" is the Platonic ideal.  If you've got a group of people in this zone, this game can be a lot of fun.  Inevitably, your well-thought-out plan will be disrupted by a slight bump in the road, a laser between the eyes, or your own bad programming, and as long as you can laugh with the weirdness this game is golden.  It's all about how you deal with the hiccups... and, of course, shooting your opponent's Twonky repeatedly in the back while on the same conveyor belt.

However.

If you get thrown out of gear by chaos -- and I know far too many gamers who do -- or if you must win at all costs, this game is not for you.  Furthermore, you'll drag down the fun of everyone around you.  The game drops to 1.5 if your game contains a single person like this, and even lower with multiples.

This game is fun, very much a logic and planning game. Although getting pushed one space by another player can totally hose you. This game is much more enjoyable when played on a smaller board. I usually only use one board for three people with two flags. Makes for a shorter game, but still lots of fun. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It's a game that almost everybody loves. I played with several groups and up to now, pretty much everybody fell in love with RoboRally (more than me!).

It has a problem: when a player gets an early lead away from the pack, it's almost impossible to catch up, because there are accidents in the pack and the solo player goes unchecked for the win. This is solved by choosing the right course: a course that make people come back to the same área of the first checkpoints.

Also, I find that the card deck gets exhausted too often. The game should contain more cards.

Otherwise, it's a perfect game for certain moments. It is fluid and always create funny moments.

First impression: Fun racing game. Programming moves ahead makes Robo Rallying interesting - and pretty chaotic. One of the most fun racing games. You probably should never use more than two boards no matter how many players there are. Even then there often is a bit run-away-leader problem but at least games will be a bit shorter. There is player elimination but it's often not a big problem

This is a fun game but it takes much too long for its own good. Players are not without control but there is a lot of luck mixed with chaos and even more chaos. All this suits the theme but do I care for the theme? No, not really. Winning this game felt just as insignificant as losing it.

Good fun, not a game I'd want to play all the time as I'd have to be in the right mood. I'd certainly suggest it if there was a big group of us and we wanted to play something a bit light hearted over a few beers. Don't play unless you can laugh at your mistakes and put up with a bit of frustrating randomess. (7.5)

One of the most hilarious games around, surprisingly chaotic for the relatively little amount of pure luck it has (quite a merit). If a round gets to be too long it might get a bit tiring (especially if you've been rolling on the floor laughing for the previous 90 minutes); at least there's always the chance that the player most likely to win lands on the conveyor belt that goes straight off the board...

I was totally blown away when I first played RoboRally at a game convention in 1995.  It was different to all those 'mainstream' boardgames I'd played growing up.  I was so impressed I went and bought it (1994 WOTC version) the following week.  So much fun to plan your moves in advance - and so much anguish as your robot gets bumped on the first register phase and you try to mentally calculate where it will end up.  It is a good idea to limit the time for planning moves.  You will find you can't help doing the "robot shuffle" as you turn your body this way and that to work out where to send your robot.  Great game! I painted the 8 metal robots that came with the game and they turned out really well.

The reason this is a 6 is because I can't find people who want to play it.  It has lots of elements of a puzzle, with some problem solving necessary.  I guess people just don't like exercises in logic.  If it were easier to find people to play, this game would definitely rate higher.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Starting this as a 7. I have only played 2 players and fully expect the rating to rise as I play with more, unless I don't enjoy the resulting chaos.

I really like how player-driven this is, which seems to be the case with many Garfield designs. In the vein of greats like Sackson, Garfield has created a barebones system where the players are playing each other more than the game. You read the rules to this and think, "That's it?", but it clicks when the robots hit the factory floor for real.

Updated to "8" when played with 7 and a short map. Hilarious and fun.

I mostly like playing this as a death match. One board, extra weapons, and a very short timer to choose moves.

I do wish they would re-release some of the old expansions.

RATING: 8
Although this 2-8 player programmable movement game plays fast and furious, even with higher player counts, some people might be turned off by the high degree of luck required to get the exact cards you need to execute the right sequence of actions on your turn. Additionally, it is easy for one, or especially two players, to practically make the game unplayable by intentionally going after others in an overly aggressive way instead of trying to get to the objectives like they are supposed to.

Even with the above criticisms, this game is an all-time classic and a blast to play over and over again with players who don't take it too seriously or become overly competitive.

This game has the feel of a computer game. Players program their robots and they all perform their actions simultaneously. The programming of another robot can spoil your own robot's programming and can screw up your strategy.  It is a very fun and light game with simple rules and high playability.

May take too long, otherwise great! Total brainlessness! Hillarious Robo-Rampage! Fantastic! If I'm behind, I often don't even bother with goals and flags anymore, I just run around harassing other players who deserve it (and if they can take it), or do other stupid moves, even if it kicks me ot of the game. You can easily do that in this game without being a jerk, believe me. 

It works only with at least 5 players. One should consider painting the miniatures, or using those of other games, because it's hard to distinguish them.

And one more very important thing: USE THE TIMER!!! Sometimes it seems best to start it at the beginning of a new round just to create stress and enforce mistakes.

I was a big [i]Magic: The Gathering[/i] player, and naturally, I've heard of [i]Richard Garfield[/i].  And I also knew that he was trying to get [i]Robo Rally[/i] published before MTG.  So I wanted to play RR for a log time.  I finally decided to pick it up on an impulse buy.  It was the [i]Avalon Hill/Hasbro[/i] version.

I like the game.  It's fun and I like to play it.  But the quality of the components was [i]really[/i] disappointing.  The game boards are made out of the same type of cardboard with which cereal boxes are made.  And they are double sided so it's not possible to play each board with the all of the others.  Some of the components are nice, like the flags and the robots themselves, but they don't make up for the really cheap feel of the game.

I gave away my copy.  I would buy it again if it is republished and the quality is improved.

I like the mayhem factor. Personally, I'm not bothered by the randomness and lack of control. Hey, it's only a game, folks, and the idea is to have fun. But be forewarned: there is plenty of both in this one. I see this as a party game, preferably for gamers, or for those times when you can spring this on non-gamers and teach it to them. The more playing, the better, assuming everyone's okay with increasing levels of chaos. Players who like to feel they're in control of what happens are not going to like this. For yourself when you start, and for new players, use the easier boards and set-ups, because the harder boards can become quite confusing and frustrating. But once you start to get the hang of it, the game plays pretty fast, and, if someone gets analysis paralysis, you can use the provided 30-second timer to get them moving. On one hand, not as hard to figure out as I imagined; on the other hand, the usual beautiful Avalon-Hill-produced four-color rule book comes with ample illustrations that nevertheless leaves one with many questions about rules--stated or seemingly not. But these are not insurmountable hurdles. My 10-year-old son, Trevor (as of 2009) rates this game a "7.5". By the time Trevor was 11 3/4 (end of 2010), he had dropped his rating to "7."

Magnificent!  Programming your robot, then watching him fall into a pit because things didn't go as planned... now that's my kind of game!  It's a good simple strategy game that involves well planning your turn.  Everyone else's turn directly affects yours and that often makes things very funny!  I like that there are a multitude of different boards, which creates in turn a multitude of different types of games.  Only one thing that bothers me... I wish the robots were more easily identifiable... I guess I'll have to paint them!

OK, at first I didn't get into this game too much. I think I just needed to get over the learning stage of maneuvering my robot. Now, this game is more fun with each new play! Place your movement cards quickly before time runs out and move your robot one move at a time to see what happens! You have to be the first one to get to each of the flag locations in order to win!

What a great, great, great game! I have no idea why this one did not sell more, and as a result, went out of print. All the expansions are great, too. (They are selling on eBay for mucho dinero!) We have played 2-player games, but they turn into a slugfest, damaged and killed robots, and a slow game. If you are going to play 2-player, choose a variation. We use this one: robot-to-robot lasers are disabled, deal out 4 option cards to each player and choose 2 of those to start the game with, and when a robot is killed, it re-enters the game at the spot it was where it started on the turn it was killed. Now you have a real "race for the flags"! We have all the expansion sets and thus, many game boards to choose from for each and every game. I thought these were too expensive when I first bought them. Oh boy, was I wrong! A game well worth the money.

I find the card deal too random and the execution phase too chaotic. If you get pushed one space off course, that can mean ending up on a conveyor or gear, and being 90 degrees out, so the rest of your turn is completely wrong. 

Some people think this is fun. I think it is boring. I suggest that the reason some people like this game is due to the emergent story-telling (and the wacky theme) i.e. unexpected, effectively random events that have a large bearing on your performance - but that stands in conflict with interesting decisions and skill. 

The game is just about acceptable if played on a single  board with checkpoints in sensible places. Otherwise it drags on forever. Executing the programming takes too long (so most of the time spent playing is spent implementing decisions that have already been made, not making decisons).

Coming as I do from an IT background, I thoroughly enjoy the challenge of programming my robot under time pressure. We play that the timer gets turned as soon as the first person finishes - which can be within seconds. That introduces a whole lot more fun into proceedings as things go haywire more often. The fact that you can make things easy or hard to suit the mood and time available is a bonus.

RoboRally is so cool and so different from anything that everyone needs to try this one sometime. This game can appeal to all ages and all levels of gamers. Get through the rule basics and setup; then the fun and magic begins when the robots finally move and the factory floors come alive.

The more players, the more the chaos and fun, but also the more length of gameplay. It's probably best to play with a timer.

Any edition is fine, but the latest edition probably has the most polished rule set.

I'm terrible at this game. I also find this too fiddly for me, and an incredible exercise in frustration.

Fun game, though you want at least 4 players to keep an early leader from running away with the game. 6 to 8 players can prove rather chaotic, with lots of kills to slow things down.

It's quite fun, but way too fiddly and long for the fun involved.

I'd definitely recommend the online implementation that was done for WotC's Gleemax a while ago, though - if the computer's doing it for you, then it's excellent, and I'd give it an 8. It also has AI to play against.

This game is highly polarizing.  You either love it or hate it.  I love it myself, even if I get trounced.  Another problem with this game is that if one person gets a decent lead, they're going to win, because everyone else is interacting with each other.

This is really frustrating - in a good way :-) The stress in programming, the limited options when damaged, the mistaken directions... Only drawback is the elimintation, make one mistake too many and you have to sit and watch the others finish the game.

Finally played it right, although the instructions are not very clear on many points, this is a fun game that has a lot of laughs. Plays quick and the more players, the better. Lots of variations (due to expansion boards) and lots of surprises. However be aware that the game can be very long, playing with less boards is better since there is more interaction and the game does not drag on with people far away from each other most of the time.

A clever game, but there are a couple of things about it that detract from it for me. First I'm not a spatially oriented person, so I have a hell of a time trying to figure out what to do--and I get easily frustrated by it. Second, this game takes *way* too long for the enjoyment you get, even if you're only using a couple of flags.

I love this game. It is a great puzzle game. There are many ways to customize the game with variant rules. Can be very chaotic so becareful when adding too many special rules. This game is fun with two players but is best with 4 or 5. Can play with up to 8 which is a deffinite plus, but more players means more chaos. The most entertaining part about this game is the humorous situation that happens when someone gets pushed or better yet, when someone makes a mistake. I often drive into a pit by my fault alone. People who don't like this game are usually the ones that have a hard time telling left from right and get confused easily by the shifting board. Others state that it is too random. True that you are delt random cards and occationally you will get stuck with a fist full of turn cards, but this is some of the fun. Just use them to shoot as many opponents as you can and make up the distance in subsequent turns. I really hate to see this game go out of print again and I wish they would print more expansions for it.

It's fun, but too long for what it is.  If you end up in the same general vicinity as other players, you'll always get messed up somehow.  There's always one player who ends up in a different part of the board, and is able to escape unscathed.

RATING: 4
Bought the new AH version on vacation, mostly because of the box and theme appealed to my son. Ended up enjoying it and the interesting mechanisms very much! Cool because you can play with so many players, has a very unqiue sequencing system for moves. Because it's hard to take it very seriously (in part because of randomness, in part because of the theme), we've had people jump in in mid-game, had others who've made no attempt to win just interfere with others, and had a wide variety of responses to it's play. It's amusing to introduce to serious gamers, who puzzle at it and take it too seriously. It is very chance drive, so you cannot get too hung up on winning, just ram around and have a good time! Kids will love the flashy look and cool plastic robots.

Update: Dropping to a 6 - this game is just too stinking long. With more plays I think this will go down lower. Novelty is wearing off...

I rarely have a bad time playing Robo Rally, except that I get tired of constantly shuffling the cards (yeah I know, next time I'll take turns!).  This game is usually pretty fun, but occasionally just goes over like a lead balloon.  Certain people just can't like this game because of the way their brain is wired, and are often miserable throughout and hurt the experience for others (just throwing down random cards, getting eliminated too quickly, etc).  Also the game can 'play out' to be very fun or semi-tedious based on luck and checkpoint locations.

I would own this if I knew I could count on people wanting to play it. It's chaotic fun, but the time pressure, and programming your moves is going to put some people off.

Played with six and it was fun, but think I prefer it as a 4-5 player game. Also find that I really only like playing it once a session. It's not a game I want to play again immediately.

This would make for a great mobile or xbox live type of game.

RATING: 6
Humorous manual, nice artwork, I always tell myself I like this game, yet somehow it's never quite as fun as I'm hoping.  Part of the problem is that it's too difficult for most of my gaming group -- most of them aren't spatial and can't properly program the bots.  But even with good players, there's just too much unpredictability, volatility and, frequently, domination by whoever gets out to a good lead.  When so many places on the board kill you, running into another bot unexpectedly can be extremely hazardous to your health.

Still, I keep giving the game chances and suggesting it to likely prospects, so I think I like it somewhat...

Great party game. The more players the better!
The chaos is sometimes so great that the last player(s) never get(s) to the first flag, before the lead player touches the 3rd and last flag to win.
We play without the timer so the move planning takes a long time. Perhaps now that we know the game it would be better with the timer so that you not have time to make the optimal move?

One of my new favorite games! It's easy to teach but hard to master. There are so many variations and different boards you can play which keeps it exciting.

Interesting game that's sort of a logic puzzle -- you are racing your robots to flags while trying to avoid other robots and lasers while using rotating gears and conveyor belts to your advantage. Easy rules, but we found it a little difficult to get the hang of how to best use the cards to get where you want to be. 

I think it will be more fun once we have a few more plays under our belts and can think about disrupting other people's plans in addition to just trying to move the right way.

Despite losing the first game, D gave this a nine.

Elemental coding.  Robots.  Seems fun at first but wears on me after a few rounds.  Still enjoy it but the game seems to have greater potential.  RoboRally drags which lowers my enjoyment and rating.  Component quality stinks.  Modular boards came out of the box warped.   Frustration runs high when another player's accidental move ruins your entire round but that is a main part of the game.  Just wish the game progressed quicker.  Large boards take forever to move across.  Forget about playing with multiple boards.  Really want to like this game more.   My family seems to like it more than me.

RATING: 7
Very cool puzzle game with a heavy dish of chaos to keep things more interesting (or frustrating, but I like a little bit of chaos). Still, chaos with 3 or 4 is a much easier pill to swallow than chaos with 6 or 7.  This game really doesn't scale well to 5 and up.  2 players is more of a logic puzzle, and you're playing the system too exclusively.

Some folks just won't want to apply themselves to what the game demands: meticulous planning, spatial comprehension, and, the frequent disrupting of plans because of (1) other players' clever play, (2) other players' mistakes, and (3) one's own occasional errors.

Not bad but pretty chaotic: players manage robots running around a facotry. Because you pre-plan all your movement for the round, if you get pushed by another bot or mess something up, it's just be a disaters for you. But I suppose that's the whole point. Not a deep strategy game to be taken seriously.

Like my non-gamer friend described it...  "the most elaborate waste of time I have ever experienced".  Well, OK, not that bad.  I might play this again, with one board and a couple of other people (not seven like last time).  It's too long to be fun for the limited amount of decisions compared to randomness - especially with many players.  Cool metal painted figures though in the copy that I played... I really like what my pal did with these.  - Played a second time.  It is not good.

Wild and crazy game, where you often don't have control after your first card or so.  If you are looking for a brain burner, this isn't it.  It is, however, a fun game for sitting around after dinner with friends, or other more "social" occasions.  Trying to navagate your robots through a factory while working to avoid falling into pits, getting shot by lazers from other robots, and running over conveyor belts make this one a lot of fun.

RATING: 8.75
A race game with a cool theme and a clever system of programming your robot movements.

Half the time is spent programming where you'd like your robot to go using a hand of cards. The other half of the time is spent watching the robots carry out those instructions. And when it all goes wrong because another robot nudged you, or because you simply made a mistake, the results can be hilarious!

The game is more chaotic (and for that reason also more fun) with more players, but can take quite a bit longer if there are too many. It is still fun with only a couple of players too, but you should expect less robot interaction & more of a focus on fighting against the track itself.

Careful track selection/design can help with these issues.

The AH 2005 edition includes loads of track suggestions, with handy ratings in categories such as "time", "number of players", "difficulty". There are even quite a few tracks with custom rules to keep things interesting & give ideas about how you might come up with your own challenges.

Components are great. The box is a little on the large size (just to handle the boards), but it is actually mostly empty. Perhaps splitting the boards into smaller sections would have helped here, and at the same time would have provided more options for creating tracks?

I love the programming aspect, planning ahead and sure chaos that will ensue.  One of my earliest game purchases and still one of my favorites.  Not sure how I feel about the Starting Board in the later revisions.  I'm still a fan of the Virtual Bots, but can understand how they could be confusing.

RATING: 6
A much loved/hated "classic" which I've now experienced as a demo on AH's website; I can see this appeals to the puzzle solving players much like Ricochet Robot did. The latter game had the problem that the most skilful player would dominate, in Roborally, your program cards at least gives lucky, less skilful players a chance, but at the same time prolongs the mental process. I'd imagine gameplay would be more fun than Ricochet, but give me brevity of mental workouts anytime. Can't really rate it as I've never played it, but I suspect it would be a 5.

RATING: 8
Absolutely need to impose time limits on turns. Also, playing with a small board is important, as it keeps interaction going. Otherwise, it very quickly becomes a game you are just playing by yourself.

A great game of rally racing with chaotic player interaction and merciless stage hazards.  I've never had such an enjoyable experience of frustration and anger when my plans fall apart.

RATING: 8.1
Simple in concept - pass through checkpoints to complete a course... with robots... that you program in all their moves before they resolve... and you might get lasered or shoved into a pit by another player's robot, often not through their own choice...

Chaotic fun, as long as you're not someone who has a problem with other players messing up your plans. Though in fairness to the game, you ought to expect this and make your plan for the turn factor in the possibility of being screwed over.

RATING: 7
Great game; headache inducing.  The timer mechanism works well.  One issue I have is that there really seems to be two strategies:  (i) race through the flags as normal, (ii) camp out on upgrades and try to take out the other players.  Both are fun, but I wish the upgrades were easier to obtain and use up.  Something like Alien Frontiers use or discard mechanic.

RATING: 5
This is a difficult game to discus as 'who' you play it with determines how good (or bad) the experience may be. The game itself is a tactical puzzle and can be quite challenging. With people that think/move quickly, this is an excellent game (a 10 rating). However, if there are 2 slow-pokes in the group then this becomes a tedious, torturous experience that never seems to end. One of the worst gaming experiences I have ever endured was a game of Robo Rally where the host for the evening convinced everyone that it was 'more competitive to play without the timer! (This particular game made a six player Risk game feel like a filler.) It is an excellent game with the 'right people'. The design feels similar to a Colovini game.

You're working through future movements in your head, trying to figure out where everyone else will move and how all the board elements will affect your robot.

3 - I love everything about this game except actually playing it, otherwise this would have been lower.

Except for one remarkable occurance, I have only ever played with 8 people, as it was for a long time the only game I had that supported 8 and when the crowd grew too large for other games and we looked for something to play someone inevitably murmered RoboRally.  from the outside this game is perfect, it's a sandbox racing game allowing you to take any path and make your own courses with ease and it features careful planning requiring logo-like programming where everyone moves simul-quentially and it has adorable robots that shoot and murder each other as they go.  This game is infuriating and a nightmare and almost every game (save the one that had 3 players) ends the same, people get frustrated with getting shoved and bumped and shot and trapped and thrown in pits and they simply walk away from the table.

A race game to get to the checkpoints first. Each turn  consists of 5 programed rounds where you have to plot your course of action. Of course items on boards or actions of other robots will interfere with your program. A good way to get a level of simultaneous movement without a lot over overhead. It can be fun for a while to figure out the puzzle of how to take into consideration all the conveyor belts, gears... not to mention what the others are doing.

I wish Hasbro would make just the new parts available for sale for all of us who have the original.

Anyone for some CHAOS???  That's what ensues when you play Robo Rally!  In this game players must successfully race their robots through a series of checkpoints by programming those robots with different cards.  What you think will happen rarely happens because other robots will push your's out of the way, into lasers, into pits, or off the board.  Don't get shot too many times or you'll lose a life.  This game can be a lot of fun with the right players!

Not always an easy game to teach, but the unique card movement mechanic makes it a great game if the players are willing. Get a lot of 'never played ANYTHING like this' over this one.

Nice game of chaotic racing. I tend to like to play this with only 1 life per Robo though. It ends much sooner, as I feel single game takes too long otherwise.

There is a lot of potential with this game, but the sheer variance of boards available creates a problem, since many of the possible setups are just a mistake.  I'm not sure I'd even want to play with 2 boards, let alone 3 or 4.

I appreciate what AH did with the latest printing and that runner board - it's much simpler than the whole virtual robot idea - but in some cases there can be a substantial advantage to starting in a given slot.

OMG so much fun :) I love this game. Programming robots and then moving them is supercool. Sometimes you can really juggle your cards to come up with something and quick. Sometimes you're lucky. Sometimes you just mess up with your spatial senses and end up in a completely wrong spot. Lot's of laugh, wacky "robot dance", player interaction. 

Register resolving is usually quite quick, don't see an issue with this. It's quick, it's frantic. Actually, game scenarios are brilliantly organized, so that you can pick up anything you like, for desired amount of players, time and difficulty. Also, it's a great sandbox game, that you can take and redesign in your own way, introducing new options, new boards or rules. Probably the second best non-party game for 6+ right after Eclipse.

And, oh, the hourglass included has a bloody red sand in it! So very cool!

What I like about this game is that the randomness and luck factor is immense, yet it is still caused by tangible elements which are the other players. So whatever happens and no matter how much chaos is caused, it is not down to that untouchable mechanic but what the other programmers do. Thus, the randomness does not feel frustrating but rewarding if anything. On the other hand, I did struggle with the complex map a bit and while I do not mind being annihilated and outsmarted by oppenents, I found it a bit annoying that I had so many oversights and lapses. Of course, I see how this is the point of being a good gamer, but it feels to brainy and puzzle-like for me. Still a nice one.

Awesome.  Best race game I've ever played.  Players who play enough go through three stages.  First is the noob stage when a player spends their turn just trying to visualize how their robot is going to move.  Second is the race stage where the players try to optimize their route.  Third is the interactive game where players play an offensive/defensive game of bluff and counter bluff while trying to optimize their route.

Excellent race-and-crash/damage the other robots game. Nigh-universal appeal and plays well with many different ages (12 ) and types of gamers. Only drawback is the excessive time that bad hands can cause the game to drag on too long. It is tough to even get a 3-flag board completed in an adequate amount of time for what the game is.
[b]If time or patience is a concern, only play 2-flag maps![/b]
I can't understand why people would want MORE options, maps, or hazards to play on - the virtue of this game is simplicty and quick-play. If you muck it up with more hazards/difficulties, it would lessen the game's strengths.

One of my least favorite games of all time. The promise of the theme is great and I want to like it so bad, but the randomness and length of this one make it so tedious and boring. this game probably has one of the greatest disconnects between theme and the successful execution of that theme I have ever experienced in a game. This game should be frantic, funny, and fast, but it manages to be none of those things. A dull game of planning actions which ultimately don't matter, in order to meet very specific goals. Does that even make sense? Why would you design a game's goals to be so incongruous to the nature of the game's mechanisms? Terrible.

I wish I'd fallen into the chasm rather than my robot. The selection of movement cards is repetative and playing them out tedious in the absolute extreme. Never again. Played it twice: one board and giant six board game. Both reduced me to committing robot-suicide just to get out of the game. My wife was the same. It is just so tedious.

Others seemed to enjoy it though - in fact, they were enthralled. If they gave it a 10, I wouldn't argue the point, as I can see why it has its fans.

Ultimately, however, this is the first game I've played in which I would threaten murder with a lead robot and a slingshot if subjected to it again.

One or the earlier board games from my collection.  This is a game that I love the concept of (both thematically and the game mechanics).  The idea of programmable movement is awesome.  Trying to push your robots through the maze is great.  However, if the board is too big or the other players aren't into it, it can be cumbersome.  I tried to play with my kids, but they struggled with the programming element and lost interest.  Now, the game doesn't get pulled out too often.

This game is suprisingly enjoyable considering the amount of chaos involved in it.  I'm usually dead set against chaos in my games, but this is just plain fun.  Everybody who has had doubts about the game and I have convinced to just try it has turned out to enjoy it as well.

Bought it at GenCon 2005.  One play so far.  Dissapointed in limited interaction and almost no option cards in first game.  However, love the base mechanic and rating may change with future plays.

I like it more now.  Mostly I needed to approach it with a party game attitude so I wouldn't be frustrated by the seeming lack of control.

Edit: Lost favor with me, dropping score.

This was the first board game I bought myself as an adult.  Having played Settlers a lot, I was looking to get something new and different for our group of friends to play, and being that I've always had an interest in robots, this game called to me.

I've played several small games so far and find it fast-paced, hilarious fun.  Picking your moves is challenging, especially with the time pressure against you.  Due to the randomness of picking cards, you often don't get what you need, forcing you to try to make the best of a bad situation.  Add in mistakes in visualizing what will happen and the inevitable unplanned run-in with another player, and this game becomes mayhem.  But even though it's mayhem, it's still fun.  People get a great laugh out of the silly, unexpected things that happen.

You would think the chaos would make the game unplayable, but because everybody is fighting the same problems, the game remains relatively balanced.  It ends up coming down to who can best visualize the consequences of their moves and who can find the safest routes around the board.  In spite of the randomness, skill and strategy are still an integral part of the game.

The boards are wonderfully illustrated and the characters are unique and lively.  The special ability cards also add an entirely new dimension to the game.

My only real problem with it is that it tends to be long.  For such a fast-paced game that requires consistently paying attention, even a short 3-player game is often an hour.  I'd love to play larger maps with more people, but the time to play grows quickly.  Also, doing the moves can be cumbersome, with people all reaching out at the same time and forgetting who has performed what steps.  I find myself having to play referee, asking each player their move and making the moves for them.

Despite the issues during game play, the people I play this with absolutely love it.  There isn't a lot of intentional conflict between players (though you'll see a lot of unintended run-ins), everybody gets a laugh out of it, and it's exciting the whole way through.

One variation I would like to try is having each person draw a random ability to start.  I find the ability cards never get a chance to come into play otherwise, but the players are always interested in them and wish they would come out more.  Perhaps handing them out explicitly would be a better option, giving everybody a varied play-style, without benefiting some more than others.

This game is high-speed, wacky fun. I really recommend it!

I love this game, and we will play it occasionally.  The problem is the time sink.  It just takes too long.  I know part of why it takes so long is because we don't play it enough, but that's the catch.  We don't play it enough => we don't want to play it. :-) Still a good game though.

Can be chaotic & it's not for everyone, but this is an occasional fun race game that involves working out where your little robot will end up following your placement of 5 direction cards each turn. 
Sounds simple, but your movements will be altered by other robots pushing, conveyor belts & turning wheels, not to mention pits & laser fire!
Can be highly frustrating when all the cards dealt to you will only turn you in circles!

An interesting concept.  Probably best with a lot of people and waypoints to really add to the chaos.  However, this also makes the games excessively long, and therein lies the problem.

Quite a fun game.  I played two games, each had six players and the general opinion was that the game is better with more people.  I would definatly play it again as it was a lot of laughs.

I only discovered this game as a grown-up, and wish I'd played it in my teens.

If you allow yourself to just enjoy the sheer hilarity of people realising they've made the wrong move or that their carefully-laid plan has been derailed by someone ramming them at full speed then the game is a hoot.

I can see people's objections that they dislike making snap-decisions or being dealt an awful hand, but I've never enjoyed a game as much while doing so badly at it.

I enjoy this game, but it seldom gets played much anymore.  All the "hosage" causes frustration in my game group, and this game is all about hosing the other players.  I don't mind the hosage so much, but I am in the minority among the players I game with, so it rarely hits the table.

RATING: 8
A very well-crafted and fun game that has attracted some reverse engineering of its system, thus unwittingly generating similar games. Nevertheless, it remains unique. The Program Cards and their related phase was a major contribution to the boardgame world, and also the game's biggest problem. Lack of practice creates a huge rift between newcomers and veterans, which can be frustrating to the point of embarrassment. It also has potential to create unassailable race leaders, thus lending itself to "finishing before the end"-type criticism. That said -- pick it up and try it out if you've never done so. An amazing game.

Knowing ahead of time that a big board with many players can drag on, we played with a small board and two players, and had a blast.  The programming was fun and the resultant chaos was fun to watch as well.  The game was pretty balanced with both of us having a pretty good shot to win outright.  All told, it was a lot of fun - only the length of game prevents me from a higher rating, as I know I won't be as quick to pull it out with larger groups.

A very fun idea, where the need to struggle through a limited set of maneuvers and the constant actions of the board make for a fun sequence of watching it unfold and see if 1) you planned it out right, and 2) did anyone get in my way. However, what keeps this from just being a gigantic puzzle is the intentional and unintentional player interactions. Once someone breaks away from the pack, this stops for him, and makes his victory all too likely. More inventive waypoint setups than what I've seen should help this problem.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
I just like programming games and this one is really the granddad of them  all. However, most maps are too wide, such that there is too little interaction between the robots and you easily get a runaway leader  problem. I really would like to see some maps which are only have as wide, such that you have tight corridor in which you cannot hide from other robots.

The option cards are not well balanced and some are really mean to your opponents.

I like that this comes with lots of pre-defined games, and the fact that you can make your own gives this near-unlimited replay value. As a programmer (in real life) I really enjoy this one - but don't worry - no programming experience is required (though I'm sure having the proper mindset helps).

Garfield has made a lot of games but there are probably only two he will be remembered for. Magic obviously. But Roborally was something really different. Watching as players try to wrap their brains around rotation (especially the body wriggle people do as they try to work out left from right).
If the game has a flaw it is that a skilled player will not merely win they will completely destroy the opposition, which can make the game a less fun when the disparity in ability is large.

It was a quick set-up, fun, interactive and the game everyone was reminiscent of the most.

I played this for the first  - and so far only - time at my local club in December 2014. It's a game I'd known about for a long time and expected to enjoy - but I didn't. The first few turns of the game are just so random that it's easy - at least for a beginner like me (although it's not clear how more experience would really help here) - to lose all your lives before you really get anywhere. And then you have to sit out while all the other players get to the point where they can plan their turns relatively easily. NO game should feature player elimination if it can go on for another 2+ hours after a player is out. I simply went home early that night - not exactly what you want when you're looking for a fun game.

More chaos and hilarity ensue due to the sequential programming of your robot going horribly wrong as robots collide haphazardly into each other and obstacles throw a spanner in the works.

As of this moment RoboRally ranks a 7 in my book.  It may be the novelty, but it is the kind of game that you think about even after it's over.  Played with 2 and it worked great with the Avalon Hill scenarios in the back of the new rule book.  UPDATE: have since played with 3 and there is still plenty of strategy.  I'm sure that with more players the chaos factor increases exponentially.

I love programming my robot and watching him go about his soulless business. I've only played this as a two player, without using the 30-second rule. This game gives me AP to the extreme, so I should utilize the timer.

It can go long if you don't have the cards to get to the flags, but if you're worried about that you shouldn't be playing it in the first place. Still, the wildly varying playtime can be an issue with players who are antsy. REVISED - Four years on, I don't ever want to play this again. Oh well.

IMHO, the best board game ever.

We play this everywhere with everyone and no one complains. Great Board Game. a 10.

3 suggestions if you will play a lot:

1) get an automatic card shuffler. Yes, just for this game lol. This will save your cards from early retirement.

2) get a tray to organize the cards and pieces. We used a 1 inch thick tackle tray with locking lid from a department store fishing isle for like 2 bucks.

3) Paint your pieces super bright colors, with a marking for their fronts :) Avoid yellow, and especially black and gray, they blend with the board.

This is the worst game I have ever played.  Loathe doesn’t begin to describe how I feel about this game.Before I continue, note that I am not talking about component quality and all that – that stuff was fine.  This is only a review of the game itself.This game is a frustration simulator.So you’re looking at this game and it sounds kinda fun.  You play as little robots roaming around doing a relay race, fighting each other and trying to collect flags before everyone else.  Sounds fun, if a little boring due to there not being a story or even much of a theme, right?Well, then you start playing it and realize that the main point of the game is frustrating your opponents.  Ok, I guess that’s fine – other games have done that and it can be pretty amusing right?  At least it will be a fun mindless way to watch components going at it on the board, right?  Wrong.  The game is in no way mindless.  You have to carefully plan out 5 turns in advance on a constantly shifting board full of hazards and other players, where any one mistake can essentially take you out of the race entirely.  But you think, ok, well even if it is kinda frustrating and I have to plan out that far in advance, at least I know what I’m going to be able to do – at least we are all capable of the same moves, right?  Wrong.  You get a random assortment of cards to build your turn out of, and whatever the deck pukes out at you is what you have to deal with to do your carefully planned and maneuvers through a randomly changing landscape where any minor mistake can take you out of the game.  Fine, you might think, there are plenty of games where dealing with randomness is part of the fun.  At least in those games, everyone is equal under the eyes of the randomness gods, right?  Wrong again!  Depending on the setup, you might start out something like 20 spaces further away from the first flag than other players.  In a game where you move -1 to 3 spaces at once, and is a race, and has random card draw, and heavy planning, and take that.Ok, you think, but at least the other players are all in the same boat – it’s not like there’s yet another layer of the rich get richer going on, right?  Wrong again.  There are cards, which while difficult to acquire, give player powers so ridiculously powerful that they can just completely change the whole game, and make it nearly impossible to beat them.Ok, but there can’t be anything else wrong with it right?  Right?  Wrong, unless you like losing your turn and watching everyone else play.  A lot.  Fall off the edge of the map?  Lose the rest of your turns for the round.  Somebody kills you?  Lose the rest of the turns for the round.  Someone has a special remote control power card that takes over your vehicle?  Lose your turn for the rest of the round AND watch as someone else pilots your robot for you.  Make one tiny mistake?  Get stuck on a conveyor belt that takes you so far away from where you are going that you might as well not play anymore.Let’s say things aren’t going great for you – you made a mistake and went off course, and while everyone else is working on flag 2, you still need to get to flag one.  So you almost make it back when… someone kills you.  Now, if you’d ever actually gotten to flag 1 your could respawn there – a little behind but not out of the pack.  But you never got to flag 1.  So you have to go back to where you started.  You know, that spot 20 spaces further away from flag 1 than some of the other players.  Oh and that’s after losing all your actions for the rest of the round.You think, fine, well, whatever, at least it’ll be over and you can do something else after.  Depending on how much time you have, wrong again.  This thing is going to take 2 hours.  2 hours of random upon random upon hateful take-that upon uneven starting positions upon random and you are going to lose turns all the time.Oh, and lest we forget, on top of all that, you can get cards “locked” so that you never get to choose which command to enter for certain points along your program until you either die or skip your entire turn again.Maybe it’s just me though – the other players in the group seemed to like it a lot.  Maybe I’m just a sore loser who just doesn’t “get” it.  Honestly though, I never blamed the actions of the other players.  The game itself is a frustration simulator, so when someone kicks you in the balls when you are down, that’s really how the game is supposed to work.  They might even be doing it by accident.One of the players in the game said that it was a great simulation of programming.  He and I are both programmers, and I would have to strongly disagree, unless when he programs the following conditions are true: 1.	You only ever have access to 5 - 9 keys on the keyboard at any one time.  Many times this includes the arrow keys.  No mouse.2.	Those keys change every 5 minutes.  You always know what the keys are, but you have to deal with what you have.3.	The cursor moves randomly across the page due to powers you have no control over but if you are very careful and thoughtful you can predict.4.	You are competing with other people that have various parts of the program already done before you start.  5.	If you mess up, the program you are working on shuts down and it only autosaves every 20 minutes, and only then if you’ve reached some kind of minimum checkpoint.6.	At random you have to sit there and do nothing for 5 minutes.7.	Sometimes the keys get stuck and they will keep pressing on their own no matter what you do.8.	The keyboard spins around in circles.9.	You can’t get up for 2 hour stretches.  Ok so maybe that is better than actual programming :)10.	And finally, someone keeps coming up behind you and slapping you upside the head.

The game play is very fun.  With the ability to have yourself set-up in the perfect win situation, only to have one of your opponents move you one square and cause you to fall into a pit.  Too much fun.  Can be a bit long if you place the flags in the wrong spots but most games are quick and fun.

I just love this game!  Sometimes the quickest way to your goal is not the most direct route.  At times the board is against you and at other times another robot may destroy your best laid plans.  Length of the game can be adjusted by the amount of flags being played with.  I'll never turn down a request for this one.

As a player of WS&IM, Autoscooter, like the forward programming simultaneous movement aspect of the game.  However, players need to work to keep the analysis paralysis down and to keep the game moving forward at a somewhat brisk place.  Otherwise, everyone plays at the pace of the slowest player.  Furthermore, boards/goals must be set-up to promote interaction; otherwise, game can devolve into simultaneous solitaire.

First you have to limit the time used in robot-programming. We use a 2-minute hourclass and it really speeds up the race. The basic game is at its best played with 4-5 players - with more robots, the gameplay starts to lag. Try playing in teams, and failing that, with 2-3 players try each having two robots - it's a killer! Nice game, I still play it now and then.

This is one of those games that is a great design, but in practice it gets tedious very quickly.  Yes, you can control how hard it will get from points A-B-C, but every time I've play this it wears out its welcome. Although not a great game, Wings of War is a better implementation of a similar mechanic.

Update: As long as you play with a lot of players and a small set-up (1-2 boards), and don't take it seriously, it's pretty fun.  But I do find it one of those games that some players often bail out early.

It is an interesting game if you have troubled with the ways. I often mix my left and right hand that is why this game causes troubles to me. But this is what makes this game interesting. Have a bot to control, have to reach check points while the ground is moveing and rotating and the others are fireing at you maybe push and the plan is in ruins.  Best of all party games.

There is a little negative feeling in this. You can fell out the game after 3 death. But I understand that somehow have to punish if you die. Home made rules can be applied, more life token, or after die you wont loose a life token, only go back to the last point an receive 4 damages inmidiatelly or such.

I can appreciate the fact that a lot of gamers like this one.  I however, pretty much can't stand it.  I've played twice now, and both plays (designed to be short) took way too long and after much of that time I was no closer to the finish line than when I started.  Frustration level is high for me, and I feel like the game is stingy when it comes to getting behind.  I see no catch the leader mechanic, and more often than not the disparity in the special powers is annoying.
I'de play this again, but you'de have to plead, as I can think of about 200 games I'de rather waste the time on.

This is a brilliant game for 4 or more people. Chaotic fun, pushing eachother around the gameboard. We usually have someone falling behind and give up and just becomes a rogue-robot, essentially doing everything they can to stop the leader or anyone in their way. This is one game where its just as fun to loose as to win.

When played with the right group this game can be great fun.  And the new boards and power down rules have just improved the game further.

Old edition:
Pit Maze: Very slow board, not one I'd rush to play too much.  

New edition:
Vault: Not as open as at first view; lots of options; quite a lot of clumping leads to lots of fun
Maelstrom: Always a fun map, because all the conveyor belts, but can be a bit predictable. 
Chess: Great open board, with lots of interaction.

RATING: 4
Nice idea, shame about the execution. The game is just too slow moving and not fun enough. Also the winner can pretty much be seen before the game's half way through. There seems to be no good combination of players and board sizes. All games seem either too short or too long. (Some player in our group tend to take this game a bit too seriously. There's been some major shouting and cursing, so I wouldn't call this game un-exciting.)

       I have a love-hate relationship with RoboRally. Some nights its fun and crazy, other nights it just seems I'm completely out of control and pretty much a spectator.

       I have no clue how to rate this game. It either deserves an 8 or a 3.  For the moment I am favoring the 8, but that assumes I can remain calm as I relinquish control.

After three games: I love the chaos here and enjoyed the game every time, even if it runs a little long. Unfortunately others won't, so I'd be all over this for full price were games to consistently run an hour or less (the box says playing time is 30 mins. +, but the BGG estimate is more accurate). Still want to get this though and would like to try cutting a flag or two from the scenarios or to maybe start the timer after the first player is done instead of the last.

A challenging, and yet very frustrating game.  I rarely enjoy this game because of all the chaos of robots running into each other.  You spend a couple minutes carefully planning your program only to have it screwed up because Player XYZ looked at one of their program cards upside down...AAAAHHHHH!!!!!!!
(Further explanation: I stated above that this is a challenging game, which in my opinion, makes it a mildly average game (deserving a 5.5).  If presented with an alternative, I will more often than not choose it instead of RoboRally.)

This is game is so much fun! Just got new courses from the internet, which look really great (robo-factory). Some people have trouble programming the robots, but in the end that is part of the fun. I recommend playing only on one board if possible, as all the robots keep running into each other that way. And put a laser on the head of every robot, very essential for more game fun. As usual play with the right crowd, it's embarrassing to play with people, who have no clue how to programme the robots. Embarrassing for them, of course!

Wonderfully chaotic, programming game.  It's a delight to see adults not know their left from right and have to stand and re-orient themselves with their robot while waggling and pointing hands as visual aids.

Perhaps a little long for what it is but fun nonetheless.

This is just an absolutely fun game. It's easy to teach, deceptively harder than it looks, and just a mess of laughter and all around hilarity. In my first game, I couldn't help my high five a buddy of mine as he pushed another friend and I into a pit at the same time.  This game is just a blast.

Even as someone who can't tell their left from their right (which is a disaster in this game!), I consider this to be an exceptional design.  It's very variable though: with the right group, this is a 10.  With the wrong group, it can be torture of a high order.  Watch out for the expansion boards, many of which weren't tested sufficiently and introduced complexity for the sake of it, instead of the elegance of the originals.

RATING: 7
Overall a highly original and good game, but the problem is that one error when placing your cards ruins the game for you. I subscribe to the theory that if 20% of your moves are bad then your score should be 20% lower, but in this game you are generally hosed completely. 

There is a German version of this which might be more streamlined and better. Will have to check it out sometime.

RATING: 8.5
Great fun! It descends into a form of organized chaos quite quickly. By the time it comes to the 5th card your robot could be anywhere! One small criticism is that the 'gadget' cards are difficult to read and sometimes difficult to interpret.

Programming your robot is a cool idea. However, it can drag on too long, and there is a fair amount of randomness in what you draw, especially when you're damaged. I prefer to play this for at most an hour, then I want to do something else. Capture the flag sounds like a more engaging version of this, as team play could add another interesting dynamic.

I had fun playing this game many years ago, but you'd have to twist my arm a bit to get me playing this again. Sometimes one just moves on from a game.

The only thing I don't like about this game is the length, but keeping to two boards and a few flags makes things manageable but at times still a bit long for what it is. Still fun with when in the right mood or with the right group.

little wear on the box, somehow I got a weird bowing in the bottom. The contents are immaculate though, I only played my copy once. The minis are lead or pewter, and Ive never painted them. 

Liked playing the game, though can be demanding on time if players insist on wanting to use more than one board. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Very much like the idea and the mechanics, it just failed to hit the mark for me.  It always seems that if a player manages to break free from the ruck, they're in the clear and just get further and further ahead.  For that reason, I much prefer playing with a whole series of 'mini-games' with resets at checkpoints.

Still, I do enjoy it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I really like this game... but it can take a long time sometimes. A good idea I've heard to keep it moving is to get a 1-minute timer, and as soon as the first player finishes their program they start the timer. Anyone not done by the end gets random programs or something.

2 copies, both very well used.

Much more fun than what it sounds like, and much better than what I expected. Lots of chaos, but it's justifiable for excellent player scaling up to 8. Board-game Mario Kart, except more fun. I thought giving instructions to a robot would be dry, but so much happens that it's exciting. Or maybe the physicist in me just likes to plan and calculate.

Lowering the rating from 8 to 7.5. I still like it, just that Shogun is better at satisfying the same itch.

RATING: 8
At one point I called this my favorite game, and also the game most responsible for bringing me into my board game hobby. Still very enjoyable and will always hold a special place in my collection, but is often frustrating for new players who can be prone to analysis paralysis or an inability to see their moves as they place them. Also a great game for adding house rules and variants, as the game mechanics allow a lot of room to try different things out.

Excellent game if you love silly antics, but can get dull quickly.  We rarely actually finish a game, but this isn't a game you play to "win", it's a game you play to get in a position where your only options are to delay your inevitable death on a conveyor belt for one more turn, or take the plunge and start over.  Goes great with drinks.

RoboRally (AH 2005) -- Played original version once; four player. Played 2005 version once; six-player. Poor component and production quality of the 2005 version aside, this is a thematically solid game.

As it was the first play for four of the six of us, we played an "easy" set-up using only two boards. Big mistake. There was not enough room for six players to avoid one another. This led to a long, tangled game.

The thirty-second time limit for the final program is a must.

Implementation issue:  The card-corner index is missing the number (for straight arrow cards), so you must look at each card individually to determine your options. This is an inexcusable flaw.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Initial rating after 1 play: 6 players, one simple room. Said to be a short game and it was 'just' 90 minutes. (Rule explanation took some time). 

The game is of that wacky *things go boom* and *plans go down the drain* type. Problem is that it moves slow - mostly because of constant need to check initiative order all the freaking time. Probably one only needs to check the move orders (and not turn orders). Interaction is there, but everything seemed so chaotic that the impression is more one of chaos than intentional interaction (then again we had that kind of room). With other maps, fewer players and so forth my impression may change - I read interaction gets more pronounced once everyone gets the flow of the game and understands how programming work. So, we'll see.

Muy divertido. Tienes que programar tus robots para llegar a unas metas comunes para todos los jugadores.
Pero la cosa se complica cuando los robots se disparan entre ellos, y las trampas que hay en los diferentes tableros, te quitan puntos de daño y te quitan cartas de programación.
Acabarás dando vueltas o contra paredes. Unas risas.

I've never had as much fun losing a game as I have Roborally. I've seen a lot of comments about how other players' mistakes can ruin the fun, but for me and my playgroup that's part of the enjoyment. :) Couple it with some alcohol and you've a recipe for disaster (and a very fun one at that).

I would not play this with any less than six players, and preferably with the maximum eight. The more complex the board, the more chaos ensues. Which equals more fun (for me and my playgroup).

We finally played this and I think we all agreed: this game is robo-tastic.  You can't top the sheer chaos of everyone fighting for access to that one flag.  I must admit too, that with my group, the timer is a beautiful idea.  We're thinking of adding it to every game we play.

Now that I have two copies, I plan on using the second start board to allow for head-to-head battles and capture-the-flag type scenarios.  I may have to step into the world of painting to begin to identify all of those pieces...

I like this game, although it tends to get a bit chaotic.  A lot of the game depends upon getting good movement cards, though part of the skill is learning how to effectively use them to get where you want to go.

Hatalmas partyjáték! A játékosok egy-egy robotot irányítanak egyszerű irányjelző lapokkal, amikből a robot sérülésének megfelelő számúval gazdálkodhatnak. Egyszerre kell lerakni minden játékosoknak előre megadott számú irányjelző kártyát, majd ezeket egyszerre kiértékelve elindulnak a robotjaink. Igazi káoszt okozva a pályán mivel ugyanazon ellenőrző pontok elérése a cél minden játékos számára. Az ilyen ellenőrző pontok körül óriási csődület alakul ki. Egymást taszigálják a robotok különböző érdekes felületekre. Ilyenek a sokféle szállítószalagok, a javító helyek, illetve a lyukak, amelyekbe az örök fémmezőkre kerülnek a robotjaink. A játék pozitívuma még a nagy játékosszám. Egyetlen negatívuma, hogy sajnos 3 élet elvesztése után ki lehet esni végleg a játékból.

June 2009: Craziness and mayhem ensues when players start moving their robots as programmed. A bit random at times, but loads of fun. Rated 7.

Update (June 2017): Downgraded my Avalon Hill (AH) version from 7 to 6 after playing the updated 2016 version, which fixes many of the gameplay issues I have with this one. I always hated the locked registers and diminishing hand of cards (the new version replaces that with "Spam" cards), almost never getting any upgrades (the new version now fixes that with buying them for energy), the annoying streakiness of getting cards from a common card deck (the new version now fixes that with separate decks for each player) and the huge amount of room requires for it on the table (the new version now fixes that with smaller cards, player mats and maps). I even prefer the painted minis of the new version to the metallic ones here, so I see the new version as an improvement in every way, except maybe the lower maximum player count (lowered from 8 to 6).

RATING: 7
Brilliant programming race that should be a lot more fun than it actually is.  This game is certainly not for everyone.  The gameplay can be a huge source of frustration for certain kinds of players.  For me, I dig it.  Most definitely not worth the price you have to pay to get this nowadays. Many fun elements, but the only thing holding back a runaway leader is the cards they get.  Next time I play checkpoints will have to double back on themselves so that players in the back can interact with the leader while still heading for their goal.  

UPDATE:  Two boards and three goals are all you need.  Any more and it just drags the game on too long.  When this is short, it doesn't outstay its welcome.  It is a great length and remains competitive (unless it doesn't, in which case it is over quick and you can start again).

Needs good planning but is very funny, especially when someone interrupts another player and completely disrupts the whole strategy, leaving the other robot running into a triple laser beam and start spinning wildly and running into walls while getting melted or something like that.

A fun little game that anyone can play.  Makes a great gateway game.  The game isn't only fun, but funny.  It's hilarious when something unexpected happens to someone's robot, and everyone gets into it.  Your own choices make the game extremely strategic for you as an individual, but the things that can happen to you by other players is nothing but random.

Before I played it, I was very excited about this game.  I recalled it being out when I first started playing Magic: The Gathering back in the 90s.  But, after playing, I find that I'm not a big fan of games that consist of programming moves.  Sure, it's a fine game for some, but just not for me.

I really don't like to play this game.  When it gets pulled out I usually go watch some time TV or play video games until they are done.  I'll only play if the others beg me to.

I feel the power cards are not balanced.  One or two cards seem to make a player too powerful.  Also there is always player AP due to the planned moves.

This is one of the biggest hits and most requested games at the board game club I run for young teens. Whenever someone plays it for the first time they seem a bit lost at first but half way through their first game everyone is laughing hysterically over the chaos that goes on and usually everyone has a great time playing it even if they lose horribly. It can be very luck based (the cards you are dealt on your turn) but if you play to have fun and not to win you'll have a blast.

Another game I can't get enough of, but finding 3 or 4 players for an exciting, chaotic, careen your 'bot matchup is an extremely difficult thing. Using the word "program" when describing what you do with the card deck gets immediate deer-in-headlights look in peoples' eyes.

RATING: 8
I love this game!!! The greatest thing about it: It can be played any way that you want! Out of the box its a race. Go from flag to flag the fastest while avoiding obstacles. This alone is lots of fun. Keep the board small and fun ensues. BUT!!! The mechanics of the game define movement and some combat. We have played our own scenarios which work SO WELL!!! Capture the flag, king of the hill, free-for-all death match, Teams, pairs, solos... This game is great...

One qualm, with the rules... The large deck of commands means that sometimes you will be left without options... Drawing 4 right turns and a u-turn is useless... I feel that the new redesign with personal decks will fix this. I may purchase extra cards to mimic this in my game. (but I hate the 6 player cap, 4v4 capture the flag is amazing!)...

And one last nit pick, the boards are so thin. They feel like cheap cardboard, and the tokens are so thin, they are difficult to pick up. 

So those two issues aside, this game would be an easy 10, we play it almost every gathering...

Great theme and interesting premise, yet I found that you had so little control over your robot between the random cards you get and everything that is moving on the shop floor and the other robots.  It also drags on and on.  In the end, the randomness and the monotony just makes it a very boring game for me that I hope not to play again.

Fun game of competing mini robots trying to cross an area filled with obstacles and hazards (conveyor belts, rotating platforms, lasers etc).  This requires pre-programming your robot's actions using cards, but your careful planning can be disrupted by other players' 'bots bumping or shooting or otherwise interfering with yours at highly inconvenient times.  Nicely presented game, enjoyable by adults and kids alike - provided they can cope with a fair degree of chaos and frustrated strategy.  With the right group, it can be a hoot.

I hate this game.  To begin, simultaneous programming isn't my favourite genre. I find it tedious. It fits the theme, except I don't care about the theme if the game isn't much fun, and RoboRally isn't. There's way too much downtime which is only exacerbated by the need to miss a turn every so often, sometimes twice in a row, and there may be nothing you can do about it. That's a lot of sitting and watching other people play. It's too chaotic to hold my interest and too long for me to enjoy the ride. And it's awfully boring once you know who's (not) going to win. As with demolition derbies themselves, I'm bewildered by RoboRally's following.

RATING: 4
After a couple of plays, I've come to the conclusion that I really don't like this game.

One of the biggest problems I have with it is the length of time it takes to play -- it either drags on past the point where you're still having fun, or nobody is really making any progress on the objectives. Add player elimination to this formula, and it makes for a very dissatisfying combo. 

The random nature of the game creates some humorous situations but it's also a big hindrance. You have no control over the cards that you receive, so you'll experience many turns where you aren't progressing towards the objectives and might actually fall further behind (hence dragging the game on). Powering down your robot in order to heal damage essentially boils down to a "skip your turn" mechanic which is totally disengaging.

If RoboRally were a 30 minute games AT MOST, I'd be able to overlook its shortcomings and have blast (not really caring about who wins). Unfortunately, that's not the case and the longer the game takes the more its shortcomings are accentuated.

This game was love on first sight.

First time I played it with some of my friends' friends. I was introduced to it as a racing game with kind of cutthroat mechanics and sort of randomness. Which didn't appeal to me much, cause you know, random things... not really my thing. But I was so surprised with it.

First off the theme is great. Robots racing cause their supercomputers are bored to death, love it. Then you have these gorgeous figures to represent your robots. On top of it each robot has a hilarious story behind it (Hulk is my favourite, it's just an awesome story). The board looks fantastic and you know what you're getting into on a first sight.

The first play was kind of a pain, because everyone except for me knew the game and they all played really fast (well at least that's how I saw it back then) and knew what they're doing. I struggled the first few turns, but when I got the hang of it... wow... I know it can be a little rough, when someone can't get to his goal, so he just tries to screw with you, but I don't know. In this game, I don't mind it because it's so much fun. I don't mind my robot being smacked, I find it to be part of the game. And you can also try to guess if you're even prone to being screwed over. I found out you can mitigate some of the random screwing by your oponents to think ahead and try to at least mitigate the danger when you know you're close to being smacked. Like when you're one space of a flag and there are 2 robots at your heels.

The only thing that made me a little suspicious were some people, who played the turn and then said "hey, why did you turn my robot that way? I was heading the other way." "Because you played left turn?" "Oh, I wanted to play right turn." Like seriously? Driving the wrong way? After that I saw those people turning around so that they knew exactly where the robot is facing and they could determine the right direction of the turn they want to make and it was just so funny.

I know it has some moments when you can get smacked up, but in this game, I don't mind. I still think it's a great fun and really I don't care who wins (even though I try to win every time I play, I'm not angry when I don't). It's a fun game to play and watch and I just love it.

It took me a long time to finally play this older game and it was very enjoyable.

The programming that makes up the bulk of the game always seemed to me like it wouldn't be enough to keep me interested but when combined with the rest of the game it really does work.  You don't always have the cards to make something happen, even with 9 cards one player had to spend the whole turn walking into a wall because she had nothing but forward moves and one turn and the turn card would force her off the map to her death.  The laser fire is also a fun layer to the game, I took so much damage I had 3 cards locked by the end of the game (I was the Spin Bot and the cards were all turns so that seemed ironically thematic).

I think this game is most fun with larger numbers of players.  We played with 5 on a smaller map and nothing is more fun than when another robot's move throws a wrench in your whole plan...forcing you into a pit or something of that ilk.  I would love to play with the full 8 some time.

This is definitely one of those older games (coming up on 20 years old) that has held up very well over the years.  The mechanics are unlike anything else in my collection and it really does work well.

A friend suggested a battle scenario (I'm not sure if this is actually printed in the rulebook or not) where every robot only has one life and the point is to be the last robot standing.  Sounds like a lot of fun to me!

The last couple of times this game has been played it took WAY too long for what it is and is really hurting my enjoyment of it or desire to play.

As long as you are expecting complete chaos in this programmable movement game, it can be fun. This is not normally my cup of tea, but my game group and I had a blast trying to get our robots to the check points while at the same time trying not to fall into the pits (either by accident, or by contact from another robot). 

This game definitely seems like it would benefit from higher player counts and goes pretty quickly despite having many players (as long as there is a reasonable number of flags). I didn't like the player elimination element, but if its a short course, it probably won't be a big deal.

Use small boards. Use a few optional rules in the articles. Timer: 30 second after 2nd to last player.

Variant: Armed & Dangerous Scavenger Hunt 2: Place option cards equal to the number of players at each flag. When a player scores a flag, the player to their right takes the pile and chooses an option to give to them. In this way, the stronger options are given to the players in the back of the pack, while the leader gets Circuit Breaker and Conditional. An even more anti-leader rule is to have the piles equal number of players less one, and not even give an option to the first player to score a flag.

Mark McEvoy: When mixing AH and WotC map boards, put an unused WotC board under every AH board, and vice versa. Then the play surface is all nice and level, with every board surface being the same distance from the table.

RoboRally is a chaotic racing game in which each player takes control of a robot, trying to be the first to reach a certain number of checkpoints. Along the way, however, players are bound to run into each other, unwillingly move off of cliffs, be shot by lasers and turned around by robotics so that they end up in places where they never intended for their robots to go. It is this element chaos that makes the game fun and a neat beer and pretzels game for up to 8 players. At the same time, however, it makes the game less suitable for an ordinary game night.

Madcap fun, if you're not too serious about things!  I actually love knowing I flubbed the play, and instead of shooting to the flag, I'm going off a cliff.  One of my fondest gaming memories comes from this game, I'd taken a ton of hits, and my last 2 cards were frozen, and I was on a conveyer to doom. I managed to stay alive for three turns, eventually maneuver my way off the belt to shut down, then screwed up and drove into the same pit I'd so deftly avoided  for a few rounds.  Classic gaming fun!  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Not enough variety to remain interesting in the long run.  I honestly think the game could have benefited very well from the bots having different special abilities to give them some variety, because as it is, having different markers which are supposed to be different robots that act in unique ways but giving them all the same basic moves seems like a missed opportunity.  Why can't, say, Hammer Bot cause a point of damage if he is adjacent to another robot at the end of a move or Spin Bot be able to use a rotate card to rotate twice in the same direction once per turn?  Little touches like this would have given the game some character.

Ultimately, though, that's not such a big deal.  The real problem is that the game just gets boring before it's over.  Almost invariably you will find most players ending up with several bad hands in a row, unable to do much to stay in the race, while one or two players will get the perfect hand every time to zoom ahead.  Usually by the time someone has reached the second flag it's clear they are going to win.  Couple that with the extreme length of even the "Short" maps in the rulebook (most last us at least an hour and a half) and you get a lot of games abandoned before they are even finished.  I bought this game based on nostalgia because I remember playing the original version with my uncle when I was 6.  I guess you really can't go back...

This game is so rich with theme, which is one thing that I really like about this game.  Programming robots to zip around the course, dodging obstacles on the factory floor.  The game can sometimes last a bit long, especially if there are multiple points to check off.

A good game, but I had to change my score from 7.5 to 6.5. I found myself not wanting to play it as often. Then, when Mechs vs. Minions came out, I found myself never wanting to play it.

I like this game a lot. I like programming my robot's moves. I like trying to figure out how my bot is going to interact with the board and guessing where my opponents may be headed. However, I have trouble finding opponents, as most people I know *don't* like RoboRally.

I've only played this twice (I think), and only with 2 players. It's not particularly good with 2. I want to play it with 4 or 5 players before giving it a rating, and deciding whether to get rid of it.

Maybe this could be a good present for the nephews…

For a game that is best played not seriously, RoboRally is agonizingly slow and annoying. Players take a looong time to complete their programs, but since you have no control over the cards you get or how others will programm their robots, this is mostly a complete waste of time. My most hated game ever, period.

I've never had a problem getting people to play this, it's just so quirky and fun!

Some people complain that it's too chaotic/random, but every time I've played it, most people get screwed over by their own mistakes in coordinating their robot, rather than gears/lasers/getting pushed. 

I could seriously play this game again and again. Though maybe not in consecutive sittings!

A classic game that holds up fine after all these years.  The most common complaints are that it is luck based, which is completely not true and that it goes on too long, which is a silly complaint.  You can make your own course, so just make short ones and this is not a problem.

It is very chaotic, so you have to like that style of game.  I think that it was one of the finest games made before 2000.

I played this with 8 people and it took almost 7 hours.  While there were things I liked about it  - mostly the planning and visualization of my long term route and my individual turn), this game is un-playable unless you put some sort of time restriction on the participants.

The boards also have graphics which show when certain hazards are active, and these graphics are difficult to see.  Additionally, with so many option cards and such a variety of obstacles there are way too many excursions rules (and then to the internet) to figure out what happens when Option Card Z meets up with Obstacle Q.

There aren't many games that I wouldn't play again, but I can't see another session of this in my future (certainly not without time restricting the moves).  The ideal time restriction for this game would involve something like a chess clock that would give everyone, say, 20 minutes total for all their turns.  That way, if you were in a complicated situation you could take a little longer to plan the possibilities, but you'd have to make it up later.

Liked this at first, I've since found this is best as a party game since play is extremely random, especially with more players and the more difficult battle boards. Use an eggtimer, and if players aren't ready in time allocate their cards randomly. Planning paralysis can ruin this game if you let it, and it's too random and silly to reward such play anyway.

A very good non-gamer game. Most "real" gamers turn up their nose at games like this and say "too much chaos." Yeah, there's chaos - but you can control it somewhat if you are talented at anticipating other's probable moves. Actually, no, you can't. But hell of I don't have fun every time I play. It just seems like everyone is nearly constantly laughing.

RATING: 8.5
You need a certain type of brain in order to enjoy this game, or at least an ability to visualize things a certain way.  But for those of us who can think like that, this is certainly a fun and unique, if slightly nasty, racing game.  A combination of great production value and a few simple elements that really bring out the theme certainly go a long way towards creating a life-like robot racing/battle experience.  And the vast array of set-ups and scenarios really makes for a very high replay value, no matter what size or experience level your group happens to be.  My only real complaint is that with only 2 or 3 players there is not quite enough interaction, but with more the playing time can drag out a little excessively.  GO SQUASH BOT!!  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 4/5  Total: 8.5/10

My biggest problem with the game is that it's slightly too complex to be idiot-proof, and as such beyond some non-gamers of my acquaintance, but if I have gamers to play with I would never choose it over something with more depth.

RATING: 7
The movement rules are vague on some points in the summary cards, and the rule book is a little dense.  Pretty good balance between planning ahead and planning on the fly, but the turns have enough stages, that it is some times confusing.  I would definitely play a couple of practice rounds just to get the mechanics down before playing a full game.  In the version I played, all the robots were gray, not painted, and some of them were fairly close in design and hard to distinguish.

Not ideal with 2P (which I knew wouldn't be), but looking forward to trying with more. Bought this mainly because was on sale and regarded as a classic.

This game delighted us from the very beginning.  With a weekly group of six players, we had played Acquire backwards and forwards and needed a new game desperately.  This one got us right where we lived!  After 12 years of playing it, Robo Rally is a perennial -- screwed up only by the rules changes in the later editions, otherwise a classic.  The original rules with the virtual bots and laser fire are the essential, the extremely rococo option cards and silly boards for people who don't appreciate the heart of the game.  In our group we tend to design courses for 45-90 minutes; three flags on two boards is a typical approach.

RATING: 7.5
[AH 2005 edition] {Robot racing; programming, simultaneous-action, modular-board, player elimination, fighting, partnership} RoboRally is an exciting game. It is full of player interaction, confrontation, intrigues and sabotage. It's even better with team-play mode, in which players have to collaborate together to achieve the goal. Turns tend to be fast. Player elimination may be a problem, if a player is eliminated early (but I think it's the problem of the player). It's also funny to see that some players always mix up the direction of turning and make himself drop in the pit or hit by the laser.

The game components are nice looking but it's very clumsy to paste the sticker on the flags.  There are enough scenarios for many plays. I think more expansions are coming.

Richard Garfield made Magic, and then he turned around and made Roborally - this is a man with something important to say.  Robo Rally is a perfect execution of a game type that may actually be fatally flawed - the pre-programmed movement game.  This game is frustrating for the spatially impaired, and can suffer from other problems, as others have pointed out.  Nevertheless, when the players are all familiar with the game mechanics, it excels.

Only played one game, but it was a complete farce. Now, Richard Garfield is a respected designer, but why one earth he designed a game with such a poorly designed feedback loop is beyond me.

Very cool game.  Those with computer programming skills possibly have an edge.  Can take a long time to play since it's hard to resist adding just one more board and/or flag.  One thing that, IMHO, helps the game immensely is the addition of a timer for laying down programming cards.  Not sure if this was a house rule or actually part of the Avalon Hill edition rules--I was playing someone else's set at a convention--but it makes the game faster.  It also makes it a bit more chaotic as people scramble to throw down cards in time, but chaotic has always been part of the Roborally charm.

Roborally is an excellent game with a mix of programming and maze crawling elements. Lack of downtime, speed of play, and intense immersion make all of these elements blend well together into a fun and engaging game. 

On the surface, the silent, heads down programming phase and the chaotic, uncontrollable movement phase looks bad. Don't be deceived. It is easy to remove luck from the game and prove that Roborally is a game of intense skill - and that the people that complain about luck simply don't get how to play the game. 

There are downsides though. The game could use a stronger catchup mechanism, and designing maps is really hard, and the game can be totally unfun on a bad map.

This game is about programming the movement of your robot with a limited number of movement cards in order to navigate your robot through an obstacle course.  I thought this game would have a lot of potential.  I found that after a few plays, it was not as interactive as I would like.  It seems once someone has a lead or falls behind, there is not much opportunity to really interact with other players.  It feels almost like solitaire for a significant portion of the game.

I only played it with 3 people, so perhaps it is more fun with more.  At least with a low number of players, this game just doesn't do it for me.

The "strategy" of trying to interact with other players and their bots, be it pushing or shooting them, feels too random since it depends on the cards they draw and place. The core of this game feels like you just set your own deck/path for your robot, and just see how the turns unfold. 

Otherwise, it's an enjoyable game. It's fun to see players miscalculate and run into a board element that completely throws their move sequence into disarray.

Warning: Not for non-gamers. Not for people lacking spatial sense (my spouse). Not for people getting attached to what they have (as you'll surely die/get grounded/pounded/pushed into nothingness or simply get stuck at the wrong point (at a conveyor belt leading off the map during powerdown, for example)). Add in beer, and multiply those problems :)

That said, this is the very best game for 4 to 8 persons (yes, I own C&B too) wanting to shoot the hell out of each other or just give a subtle bump and see another bot going into the wrong directions... Why does it stand out? It's actually two games in one.
First phase, you'll be making your plans, laying them down carefully and anticipating what will happen. Chuckling in the thought you'll make things very difficult to some others, and feeling very superior about your perfect plans.
Second phase, you'll be screwing over other players (teehee), get screwed over (huh, what?) and discover you mixed up your program (oh no!)... Basically enjoying the chaos all around you :)

This game is unpredictably fun. Could last an hour; could last four hours. I played one 8 player game (3 flags) that lasted a mere 1.5 hours. Yet playing 2 player with my wife (4 flags, 2 team bots apiece) took 2.5 hours.

I really like the multiple board flexibility. Yet, if I could play more I'd look for new boards to add to the game.

Game play is longer than I would like, but it can be great fun on the right map, with the right number of people.  I prefer fewer maps and a tight flag arrangement to force interaction between players.  Wish the expansion maps were still in print.

Great game, I love seeing everyone talk about the good or horrible moves they will be making and seeing players with 5 or 6 cards decide on what to do, you would think with less cards it would be easier, but it never is.

The game is very unforgiving if you make any mistakes. Way too dependent on luck as a bad draw or another player can screw you over for many turns. Weapon upgrades are random and totally unbalanced.
Best part of the game is if you get fed up you can just kill yourself.

Two things tht you need to know about Roborally: 1) Dont use too many flags, because a game can last a lot longer than necessary and 2) Do not fall behind, if someone gets 2 flags ahead you might as well pack up the game and move on to something else.

The game seems to have way too much AP for my liking, an egg timer may help things out, and my current group of gamers I play with just don't seem to enjoy it like I do.  If the game didn't run as long it may hit the table more, but I fear I soured my group on it our first time out.

RATING: 5
I played this one a long time ago, and recently played it again.

It's an interesting race game, and can be fun, but how well you can do is very dependent upon your card draws, and how you can adapt spatially to the changing surroundings and other robots.   

It's an alright game, but not worthy of it's reputation.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I have had the opportunity to play this game twice now with a local gaming group.  Although I like the concept this game is too prone to analysis paralysis.  Yes, a timer can be used but then it favors those that are more spacially oriented than others (and yes - some people would have a hard time putting themselves in the eyes of their robots knowing what a right turn would do).  Overall it will either be a brain burner (to allow those that are spacially challenged to have enough time to think out their move) or very chaotic.

Absolutely superb game and my first purchase of a BGG worthy item. got it  long time back when it was first released.  Actually it was as a replacement to another Mr Garfield game, meant fill a gap in my gaming circle once I had given up CCG and magic in particular.  I was after something that came in a single box and didn't require me to buy endless booster packs and expansions.  Anyone checking will see that I have all the expansions for this too "all this has happened before an will happen again" comes to mind.  Curse you Wizards ( but at least I still play this)

2/26/06 - This is a fun game. The random card sets appear to take a bit away from the strategy but they also make the game interesting. The replay value of this is pretty high. This game holds up well for big groups of 8 as well as it does for a pair of players.

10-Dec-2008: I've always wondered about this game and I've even wish listed it and read the rulebook. Finally managed to get a 6-player game at Billabong. Gosh, it took over 2.5 hours! With just 1 board! My feeling is that although there is much hilarity that happens in the game, it suffers from game length and too much downtime. Chaotic fun in games is fine, except when the game drags for over 2 hours! I'm definitely NOT getting the game, and I would only consider playing it with 4 players max.

Absolutely an amazing concept, and I love the designer, his game magic has become an obsession of mine and King of Tokyo has been my #1 board game since I got back into gaming a few years back.  But all that being said, the largest flaw this game has is once you get behind, it is freaking punishing.  You might as well just quit the game.  Honestly it is frustrating enough I would bash many games over the head with this complaint, but Roborally has so many good laughs and such great theming I really can't hate on it too much.  If it wasn't for the sometimes drawn out length and effectively knocking players out of the game, this very well might be a 10 right beside King of Tokyo.

RATING: 7
Using program cards to determine your robot's movement is a great concept, but I only enjoy the first half hour of a game.  After that, there is probably a leader, who will probably win the game, and everybody else is at the back, pushing and shooting each other.

The new version definitely improves on the old, as the faster boards make it possible to finish a game in under an hour.  Unfortunately, I think the cards just make it too luck-based/random to be really interesting.

I find RoboRally a blast (haha, no pun intended). More players adds more chaos, but in a good way. The key to enjoyable play is quality board design (I wish the original rulebook had included more guidance in this respect). I find the best way to construct a racetrack is to limit yourself to two (and never more than four) boards with 2-4 checkpoints. Less is more.

This is a very fun game, but one that feels like the players don't have much control at times.  You can get a bad hand, get bumped, and get shot.  However, it is still fun, especially if the players that are floundering a bit keep a good attitude.

10/20/2013 - I still love playing this one, but I don't think I'll ever play with more than six.

Fun times with this one.  Found out a few times that this game got played and introduced more then munchkin to the players for a few weeks.  One of my gaming group had his sister in town and when it came for the part of the turn where "lasers fire" they both would go "pew pew!"  This alone added so much more to the game.

Weeks later I left for home and returned, however I left this game at home after being told by one of my gaming group that he doubted anyone would ask for it. I had a feeling that someone would request this and sure enough it was (and by someone who I didn't realize, really liked the game.)

Haven't played this for years now, and I don't recall enjoying it much at all. I'm not sure why, as the mechanics sound like they should be pretty interesting.

This game has a great mechanic(pre-programmed moves), paired with several bad ones. The length of time to play through each card in your register as you find out who goes first exponentially increases as you add people. Playing the "Expert" boards are nearly impossible to finish in a reasonable amount of time.

RATING: 6
A fun, chaotic programming game (Himalaya borrows the mechanic from this) with racing & fighting robots. My major gripe with this game is it's pretty heavy luck of the draw; you might easily spend two or more turns just turning around for lack of any movement cards, or first forcibly end up on a conveyor belt, then be sent to certain death on it, simply for lack of suitable cards to escape your fate. A bit less chaotic version of this could easily be a 7, even an 8.

We have a big group of weekly gamers (usually 6-8) and this is a good game for that size.  Although we seem have trouble getting through 4-or-more-boards setups.  The Armed &amp; Dangerous expansion is a MUST, but oddly enough we use the boards from Crash &amp; Burn most of all.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Incredibly challenging, intriguing game of catch the flag where you must program your robot ahead of time and play out its actions, hoping that board elements and your challengers don't get in your way. It can be a surprising brain burner, but it's also hilarious and can work well as a party game. You're not allowed to think too much as there's a timer going on the slower players--which might be aggravating (we sometimes remove the timer when we're playing with my parents, for example). I especially like the detail of giving each robot characters its own quirks and personality. I've pretty much bonded with my go-to character, Twitch. Watching other players get turned around, run off the board, and power down only to be hit with lasers the entire time is a blast. It's definitely not for the easily overwhelmed, but for everyone else RoboRally is a great game.

Players who value precision may likely be frustrated by RoboRally.  This is the programming game to end all programming games, with so many variables that only the most spatial players will succeed on the first few tries.  But everybody else will have a great time if they simply succumb to the pandemonium--and they may come out ahead, too.

If you are a euro player who likes to calculate and plan everything out, and gets upset if another player ruins your plans, then stay away.  This is deliciously chaotic.  Maybe it is because I like the spatial problem solving that I enjoy this.  Obviously not to be taken too seriously, and don't create too long a course, because it has a run-away leader problem.

An addictive combination of brain burner and beer &amp; pretzels. Watch your opponents do the &quot;Robo Bob&quot; as their heads twist and tilt plotting out their robot&#039;s route. Then watch them scream in frustration as one innocent bump disrupts their painfully-crafted route, diverting their robot into a torturous maze of conveyor belts and spinning disks or just dispatches it down the nearest bottomless pit. Thrown in an arsenal of silly but potent weapons and you&#039;ve got yourself a couple hours of cruel cackling to indulge in.

Bought this one for my roommate for his birthday -- should have bought a copy for myself!  

Awesome theme, clever mechanics, and a perfect blend of chaos and strategy.  I don't see myself ever getting tired of this one.  It does suffer from the occasional runaway leader or dragged-out conclusion, but pick your maps right and those problems are largely negated.  Fight your way across three boards at once and you're inviting a bit of trouble.

RATING: 6
A robot racing game which plays very quickly through the utilization of simultaneous turns and a timing mechanism which limits the duration of the planning phase. The experience is best defined as pure chaos due to the speed of gameplay and the multiple factors which can alter even the best-laid plans. Despite this game diverging from the mechanics of many of my favorites, which employ heavy doses of strategy and low amounts of luck, I find the game to be somewhat novel and entertaining. However, because I find the speed of gameplay to actually be somewhat stressful, I'd have to be in the right frame of mind in order to want to bring this to the table.

1/8/12 -- With the right crowd, this game could be a lot of fun. I just don't think any of my groups are the right crowd. It's so chaotic that it's frustrating! Players will often feel like once they get a little behind, there's nothing one can do to stop the runaway leader. I've definitely felt that way. once as the leader, and once as a behind player. I'll probably be trading it away, but I've decided to give it one more go before it comes to that.

I can imagine a future where they could create a 3D version of this game with small, cheap robots that actually move, and a board with moving hazards... now that's a version I think I would love to play.

You certainly have to enjoy the chaos that ensues from the programming. You also have to be able to do well with spatial reasoning.

If you are fine with this then RoboRally is amazing. I love it! 

I think that the chaos is wonderful because it makes for some truly great gaming moments. 




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 1

The game needs a few rule variants to make it fun. We generally play with giving out powers for people who fall behind, or make it so that the leader needs to 'break through' the checkpoints by shooting them first.

The game can be frustrating with players who don't have the spacial reasoning to track their robots movement in their head.

Love the game though.

I really liked my first few plays and then I had The Game That Would Not End.  I think there were two factors that caused the problem - I kept thinking I could finish without powering down, and we were playing that you had to return to the start position.  I had a pleasant enough experience the next time we got the game out, but the previous game alerted me to the potential for tedium.

RATING: 7
This is a fun and highly interactive game but can be quite chaotic with a lot of players. There is also a potential for serious individual downtime depending on the condition of your robot. Still, I think I'd enjoy playing this game again. 

**update: Having acquired an older version of the game, I must say I strongly recommend only the newer version of this game be purchased. There was much we found frustrating in the older version that the newer one addresses quite smoothly. This game can be very frustrating for young children if they are set up in situations where their robot can die quickly, but this can be avoided with advance planning by the adults.

Like so often, a brilliant theme is ruined by a game that is made mainly of flaws. Robo Rally suffers from a severious runnaway leader problem. The chaos produced by the different robots pushing each other, jammed progam slots etc., but the game drags for far too long to be justified by a good laugh every now and then, and since a player that gets ahead is hard to get caught up again, the game's often decided early, which takes out any tension.

Colt Express does the chaos through action programming thing far better, tighter, shorter, funnier, and produces more laughter will still giving more illusion of control to the players.

Oh man, how I loved this game when we first played it.  A big group of us, all crashing and shooting each other, screaming with laughter and despair with the collisions.

But then I played it with one other person, and we just wandered around silently and separately and the best roll won. :/  Big disaster.

Definitely a game for a large group, when everyone's not thinking or trying too hard; maybe after some drinks.  Fun.

A game that's a poster child for separate ratings on BGG for 2-player, 3-player, etc.

A fun game that I have had a blast playing in a  group, great tongue-in-cheek humor.  Love the speed of play, general chaotic feeling, and ability to customize the game depending on number of players, map selected, etc.

Certian people will hate this game, and that is totally cool.  It plays best when treated lightly.  I can think of very few games that I would say are definitely better with alcohol, but this is way up there on that list :D

Oh one thing; if you've ever had a bad experience on this game, be sure to try it with a small board if you didn't before.  A lot of gamers go for big courses right away, but Robo Rally is better with a constricted field; cram a ton of robots into a small space and have fun!

About [thing=18][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
An actions programming game in which players are represented by robots, whose objetice is to race to reach first some check points around the board. There are elements on the factory (map) that interacts with players, causing more mayhem and giving options and restrictions. And, of course, when talking about programming actions, there is plenty of room for chaos and despair, as when someone pushes your robot into a place you didn't expect and now your following actions can lead your robot to be destroyed!

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
Is very simple: players receive a hand of cards (9 cards, minus possible damages on the robot) and must place 5 of them, in order, to be activated later on. There are Move 1, Move 2, Move 3, Turn Left, Turn Right, U-Turn and Back Up cards.

After everyone has placed the five cards on the personal boards, players will reveal them, one by one, at the same time. Every card has an initiative value, and the higher the numbers will activate first. There places on the board that do damage to the robots, or that move them around. Also, if a robot has its front facing another robot, it will shoot at it, causing damage.

The objective of the players is the reach all the check points, in order, first.

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
What cards to use, considering the spatial positioning of the robots and the features of the board and also the initiative value of the cards to be used (the higher it is, more likely that you will use it first, thus having more chances of actually making what you want with it), in order to advance as quickly (and/or as efficiently) as possible, as [thing=18][/thing] isn't  survival game (even if players can be eliminated and robots take damage and can be destroyed), it is a racing game.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- [thing=18][/thing] is a fun game, as it leads to situations that laughs will issue;
- easy to learn (the explanation took around 5 minutes);
- little overhead - the game is what it is, without additional mini-games;
- good replay value, as there are several ways to build the maps and even using the same map, but puting the check points in different places will change the way to achieve the goal;
- if playing without the upgrade cards, there is almost no in-text game, so language isn't an issue.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- It can drag, a [u]lot[/u] when playing with 6 or more players;
- if using a larger map, the play can easily pass 2 hours;
- there is player elimination, but is rare;
- no catch-up mechanism in a racing game means that you can lag a great deal behing without having real chance of winning (add this to the first and second bad news, and you got a treat for yourself!);
- there is some (not a lot, like that of [thing=31481][/thing] or [thing=38453][/thing]) stress in choosing the cards, since there is a limit time to it (after there is only one person still picking, a sand timer is used), but is a very minor problem, even for the players that don't like this sort of pressure.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Like in a race without tracks. And also in a little war, as shots will be coming from several places. It is like Wall-E meets Rock'n Roll Racing, minus the track. And, by the way, a [thing=18][/thing] variant for Wall-E robots, with special power for each of the main robots, would be awesome!

Programming actions isn't the most simple of things when considering several possibilities, which makes stronger the case of playing with up to 4 people, as there won't be as many uncertainties.

In the end, [thing=18][/thing] is a fun game, with simple mechanics and no mini-games attached. It requires some control over player count and size of the map, but these are easy to apply. Not as stressful, tense or complicated as others games of programming actions. Therefore, I recommend it for families, light gamers and even hardcore ones.

As a programmer by trade, I was very intrigued by this game when I first encountered it.  I was not disappointed because the game really does feature programming (rudimentary programming, but it's there nonetheless).  Determining the best possible path for your robot given the current accessible instructions (which are very often not ideal) creates the solid strategical thinking, while watching everyone's robots crash, shoot each other, and veer severely off course creates the goofiness and laughter that puts a smile on everyone's face.  It is a well-rounded game that I enjoy quite a bit.

Let's face it, the game can be a little chaotic, and I can play 3-4 rounds in 30 minutes on the computer. RoboRally is one of those rare instances where a game translates as well, if not better, to the computer. There's very little chance that this one will ever slip from #1.

RATING: 5
Not for mature gamers.  The mechanics were inventive when this was new, nearly two decades ago, but have been improved upon and incorporated into better games.  This one's runaway issues make it poorly suited to those looking for a finely-tuned machine.  As a party game, then - zany bonkers action, right?  Not really; here the lack of downtime and amount of concentration actually work against it, killing any chance of socialization.  And it takes too long for party games, at 60-120 minutes.

Suffers tremendously from runaway-leader /and/ runaway-loser.  
 
Once you get out in front, you have fewer robots near you - so you're less likely to take damage AND less likely to get pushed AND have better archive points.  
 
Deliberately going for archive points is counterproductive because they're often so far out of the way that it's not practical - and/or on the edge of the board, leaving you more vulnerable to the death you're trying to prepare for.  Once a loss happens, particularly before the first flag, you're penalized fourfold - you lose the rest of your turn, your position takes a huge hit, you get extra damage (itself a double penalty putting you closer to death AND making driving harder) AND lose hardware.  You might get away  from your competitors but this doesn't really help since you'll have to get near them again, from behind - and often it just means going against the flow of people returning in the typical relay-race flag configurations.

There are time, luck, tactical, planning, teaming, bluffing, threatening elements. This is a great game system. There are many meaningful and creative variants provided from the latest edition and from public domain. Team modes are my favorite play settings. Team capture-the-flag, team-rally, or team-survival are exciting.

The rating is for the original edition with more than two players - I got very tired of it back in the day because it just took far too long for what it is. I don't mind the 2005 edition with two players (I haven't tried it with more).

Good chaotic fun.  If you're looking for heavy strategy this isn't it. I love this game but in loving it I have to admit its faults.  It can take too long, you hope for bot interaction but don't always get it, many people I've played with get frustrated and disinterested.  I still think it is a brilliant game!

Robo Rally is a game that most people either love or hate. Me, I am still not sure. I love having to program five steps of movement at once, and I love the way in which the boards affect that movement. It's just a pity that you can be ridiculously unfortunate with the many card draws (denying you to move at all during your turn!), and that the games takes A LOT of time to play with 5 or more players. I think I liked it better as a student.

Used to want it, not anymore. I think this game represents some very terrible aspects of non-Euro games. First, runaway leader is a tremendous issue here. If you get killed early on and remain far away from the flag. Good luck to you! The second aspect of the game is how slow the game gets with more people, even on simple boards. If you are lagging behind...the game will drag you down even more. Thirdly, there is player elimination. I generally avoid those types of games.

I got to play this for the first time at WBC 2005 (4 player).  I had read the rules, and knew how the game works, but I did not appreciate how easily things can go wrong.  I can also begin to see how important board layout is.  A couple of mistaken interactions can put you behind quickly, and you need to make sure that getting ahead doesn't also put a player in the clear.  I am also glad to see for myself that any complaints about game length are entirely self inflicted.  This game can be as short or as long as you want it to be.  Thank you Avalon Hill for re-releasing this game, even with mediocre quality components.

Very fun game especially if you can get a large group together of 6-8. We have found we have the most fun with this game if we just play on one board with 4 flags that require criss-crossing paths to force more interaction. If the board is too big sometimes one robot will just get away from the pack and it is hard to make up ground.

I've had this game for a while now, and I've only played it a handful of times.  That's because the first couple of times we played it, nobody had any fun.  It was just too long for what what it had to offer.  We pulled it out again the other day, however, and it was delightful.  I think that you need to be really careful to set up a short game.  One board with two targets, or something similar. If you keep that goal in mind, it's really a fun, chaotic filler.

Even though RoboRally can be frustrating and take a little longer than anticipated, it can be a lot of fun. 

Do you try to smash your bot into your opponents, or make a mad dash for the finish line?

My 2nd favorite all time game. 

Tons of player interaction, and far less luck than you'd think for a game that uses cards. 

We usually modify the rules for options so that we both get to use more of them (which I think improves game play) but also so that's it's less random what you get.

I've really wanted to love this game, the concept of it sounds like everything I would really enjoy in a board game.  High player counts, fun silly mayhem, robots, messing with your opponents... it just doesn't all result in fun for me.

I've played with 4 players, and it was decent, not a whole lot of interaction.  Played with 8 players and it was mayhem, but not really the good kind.  There was still not too much interaction, instead just a lot of time-consuming turns.

Each time I've played, it feels like it overstays it's welcome, everyone gets bored before the 4th flag.  It gets tiresome having to constantly move all the board mechanics.  There's always a runaway leader.  And there's always occasions where you get nothing but turn cards and spin in a circle for an entire round, or nothing but forward cards and you're forced to run off the board.

Also, feels like so many missed opportunities.  Would enjoy 3d aspects to the board, and more individualized robot characters, and more interesting ways to interact.

Just not for me I guess, sadly.

An extremely original and flat-out great racing game, with a madcap theme and sense of humor.  Peoples' two big complaints seem to be that it can take too long or that it has a runaway leader problem, and sometimes they're right, but, still, I love this game!  It just clicks with me: sitting there at the table, poring over my cards, studying the boards for just the right path, and desperately hoping another player won't screw it all up in a single card's movement.  Heck, just watching everything go wrong can be fun.  And for the naysayers, just use one or two boards at the most for your race, zig-zagging the flags back and forth across them, and I think you'll find far less of a problem with game length and runaway races.

Rated after three games, the game definitely gets better if there is enough beer. :) The idea in the game is great and various boards give the game more lifetime. I don't know if all the options are really balanced or not, but this is a great game for social events.

Updated after the fourth play, first time without beer (and with lot of incorrect rules). Still nice, but a smaller board would have been better...

Fifth play on a smaller board, just one. Others were newbies and the beer was back. Took much longer than I expected though... Still a good game in good company.

Brilliant idea for a game. Not so brilliantly executed in practice. Would be a great game for BSw, wherein the computer would resolve all moves.. I think the additional time, however small, that is necessary to resolve the moves throws a wrench in the pace of the game, or maybe I just don't have patience for this type of game, even though the mechanics are fascinating.

Imagine that you're a supercomputer. Now imagine that you're bored. So you dream up a little contest for you and a couple of your supercomputing buddies. Your task is to move one of the stupid little robots out on the factory floor through a series of checkpoints scattered throughout the factory. The wrinkle, however, is that the factory floor is filled with all kinds of inconvenient (if not down-right deadly) obstacles located in various locations: conveyor belts, crushers, flame-throwers, pushers, teleporters, oil slicks, pits, et cetera. But the real fun comes when the robots cross each other's path, and suddenly your perfect route is something less than that...

MY BRAIN HURTS!!  If a game gets too many people, or too many boards, then it takes way too long, gets way too chaotic, and gets way too frustrating.  With about 3-4 players, though, it's just about right.  The rule using the sand timer, though, is essential to keep the game moving.

RATING: 7
Really good game - challenging for the brain (all those linear combinations of movements...), tons of fun, very versatile. You can make it a beginner's game with an easy board and a couple of flags or you can let all hell break loose on one of the more difficult boards. It's no problem if someone wants to leave or jump in in the middle of it, AP can easily be prevented with the hourglass, and if someone wants to make it into Robo-chess - well, that's fine, too, you ditch the hourglass. The movements resulting from a bad hand or too many damage points evoke hilarious cartoon-like images of robots repeatedly banging against walls and I don't think this game has ever been played without anyone starting to eventually produce sound effects. The only tiny flaw is that if you take it too seriously you might get frustrated with the randomness of the cards you get dealt.

RATING: 7
This is the boardgame version of Robot Wars. There are pushers, pits, and bot on bot violence. Everything cool about the T.V. show is here. I wonder if anyone is owed some endorsement money?

I have the 2005 reprint of RoboRally from Avalon Hill...err...Wizards of the Coast. It comes with eight plastic robot models, two decks of cards, four game boards, a sand timer, and a couple of sheets containing tokens and player aids. While nothing is terribly wrong with the components, the cards seem a little flimsy and the double sided gameboards are really just thick pieces of cardboard. It all feels a little cheap, considering the $40 to $50 price of the game.

This is certainly a love it or hate it game. It takes quite a bit of planning and predicting, as well as a strong sense of spatial relations to keep your robot from running in circles. Of course, since you plan your moves 5 turns in advance from a random distribution of cards, going in circles is sometimes your best option! To make matters worse, one little bump from an opponent's bot can make your little guy end up half way across the board from where you had planned. Early in the game this is hilarious. Three hours in...it can be maddening.

Essentially, RoboRally is all about making order out of chaos. This makes the game challenging and sometimes a bit frustrating. The core mechanic of programming your robot's movement is pretty ingenious, and  gives the game a bit of a puzzle feel. While this is great in terms of actual gameplay, the reality is that the game can become quite intense. Maybe too much so. This is not a very social game, as it takes piles of concentration to make any progress. It can be quite draining over the few hours it takes to play. Sometimes it can devolve into a complete buzzkill, with everyone burnt out on gaming for the day...after one game. I don't feel this is really a design issue, it is simply a demanding game by nature. At the very least, it is something that should be considered before it hits the table with your game group.

Personally, I love the idea of this game more than actually playing it. I think the mechanics are nifty, and I love it when everyone gives up racing early in the game and starts trying to destroy each other. That being said, there is a lot about this game that makes me feel like I am solving logic puzzles rather than relaxing with my friends. I also have yet to play a game where half the field wasn't out of the race two hours in. Inevitably, those players either get extremely antsy or worse yet, annoyed. This leads to disinterested, random card play or unnecessary combat that tends to stop anyone from winning. As a result, the game goes on even longer, amplifying the effect. This flaw is due more to human nature than to the design itself, so I don't really hold that against it. I am just very careful about when and to whom I offer it up.

I got this game after it went out of print.  I really like it.  It can be slow until you get the hang of programming your bots.  I think the addition of a turn timer would be a great addition.  Part of the fun is seeing your robot do something you didn't plan because you hurriedly put your program cards down to get done in time.

The game is wild yet complex. Everyone "programs" their robots simultaneously with 5 commands and then we execute the commands in order. The robots shoot each other, push each other, get crushed, go around on conveyor belts, etc. The goal is to be the first to hit all the checkpoints.

I'm a computer scientist and a sucker for robots, so this is a theme that hits home.  Big groups makes the game more random, but also a lot more fun, what with everyone bumping and shooting everyone else. I wish I could rate this higher, but the game just takes too long for what it is.

--
Update (2015): Twin Tin Bots is the game I really wanted RoboRally to be: It has much more direct interaction since it's based on competing for the same resources, rather than racing. And the programming mechanic (changing one instruction at a time on one of two bots) is both faster and more interesting than RoboRally (create a program from a random hand draw). Love Twin Tin Bots, will trade RoboRally.

I really like the theme and mechanics of this game. So far I've only played simple versions, but I look forward to scaling up and and playing bigger games with more players.

I love this game!  I've been hooked on it since I read the first review, and I play it every chance I get -- which isn't too often, sadly.

With so many great games out there, and so many different types of games, it's virtually impossible for me to choose just one game as my All-Time, Number One Favorite Game.  But if I HAD to choose just one, Robo Rally would be it.

I particularly like how there is so much variety to how to set up the boards and how to set up the flags (not to mention the variety between the different boards themselves).  A simple adjustment in board or flag placement will have a large effect on the difficulty of the game.

Also, the game mechanic of being issued a limited number of cards to program your robot for the next 5 phases is a very good one.

As a bonus, I've found that it's very easy for people new to the game to learn the rules and join in ... and give the veterans a run for their money.

Your task is to move one of the stupid little robots out on the factory floor through a series of checkpoints scattered throughout the factory. However the factory floor is filled with all kinds of inconvenient (if not down-right deadly) obstacles: conveyor belts, crushers, flame-throwers, pushers, teleporters, oil slicks, pits, etc. And when the robots cross each other's path, and suddenly your perfect route is something less than that...

This game is more about having fun and having a good time than having meaningful strategy I feel. That being said, maybe with more plays I will find that the strategy side picks up. None the less, it was great fun and hilarious playing this and I look forward to playing again. Needs a higher player count to achieve max fun.

RATING: 9
Easy to learn the basic gameplay, but can be difficult to visualize the robot's moves in advance when the board has multiple obstacles.  The game becomes more fun with more players, because there is more chaos.  In fact, this game with 5 or more is guaranteed to produce laughs because the unpredictable will happen!  And really, the fun part is when someone inevitably screws up -- that's really the random part of the game, because it could just as easily help you as kill you...  If someone asked me what is the best game for 7-8 players, I would definitely say RoboRally!

It would seem that a lot of luck is involved with the draw of the cards, but it doesn't play that way - in our group, the best players always win.  

A downside with the game is that you do need at least 4 players, and I would even hesitate to play it with just 4 - but add a 5th player and I would never turn down this game.

Played once (with 6 players). A rather chaotic game of planning ahead, especially with a large group. Also, it tends to be long with many players, so I would rather play again with 4 at most - even though some of the unpredictability will probably be lost, but I'm not sure it's a bad loss.

Fun. A weird mix of chaos, heavy thinking, and chrome, but it all fits together well.

Note that my wife, who isn't so great at spatial thinking, did not enjoy this game in her one play. She felt like she didn't have much control or effect on what was happening. Apparently not a game for everybody!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Fast-paced and very fun - one of my favorite games of all time.  It has a near-perfect mix of luck and strategy, plus loads of player interaction.

With two or three players this is mostly a racing game, but the more people you add (up to eight out of the box) the crazier things get.

It has four different (double-sided) boards and eight flags, which provides countless course layouts above and beyond the premade ones shown in the rulebook.  Depending on how many flags you place and where you put them you can make the game as long or as short as you want.  Using all of them will end up being way too long unless they're in relatively "easy" positions, but 3 or 4 is usually pretty good for a small map and 2 or 3 is good for a larger (multi-board) layout.

The programming aspect can be a bit frustrating to players that have a hard time visualizing where their robot will end up at the end of each register, but after a few turns most people should get the hang of it.    It comes with a timer if AP or excessive slowness is a problem, but we've never used it because it tends to just penalize players who are already having a hard time with the game.

We use two house rules:
1)  The Mechanical Arm option/upgrade is removed from the deck [i](it's *way* too powerful if someone gets it early in the game or if it's a difficult course)[/i]
2)  If a player is dealt a hand made up of only straight moves or only rotates, they can call a "mulligan" and get dealt a whole new hand.  [i](This way no one can say they got screwed by a bad hand.)[/i]

My biggest problem with playing RoboRally is that I'm dyslexic and I frequently get my left and right confused.

RATING: 10
This game is so great, I never even bothered to buy any expansionsets. Fun to see people twist and turn to see What direction their robot will be facing. Never played with the 3 Deaths = Out Of Play rule. Destruction is a big part of the fun, and bad players should not be kicked out. If they can&#039;t win, they should have fun!

Had been interested in this game on premise, but in playing it...uggh.  The thing is that there is no real randomness during a turn, so you'd THINK that the game would be about planning very well - and that sometimes does pay off, and when a particular chain of events flows well it's fantastic - but then someone comes flying in from some other angle for inexplicable reasons, bumps you one square, and now your carefully-planned sequence of moves has you soar off the board instead of catching a flag.

Of course, while there is no real randomness DURING a turn...yeah, setup can be a pain.  Try accomplishing anything with no turn cards... :-/

I dunno, not really a fan of this one.

Really needs to be a computer game. The concept is excellent, but there isn't enough interaction with few players, and it takes too long when you have many. Also, it really should be a game about clever tactics and anticipating others' moves, but in my experience mostly comes down to who can go the entire game without making a blunder cause they e.g. put a Turn Left when they meant to put a Turn Right.

Both the length and the blundering aspects would be fixed by a computer version that did move resolution for you and offered a preview of what your move is going to look like (assuming no interference from others) before you commit it.

This is an interesting game, and I'm glad I played it. By far, its strength is its originality. The worst part of the game is that it is a bit of a hassle with some opponents, and it feels a bit too "cartoon"; it is a simple game that is best for players maybe 10 or 11 years old, making it a bit worse for me. However, the excitement that can be reached with game-play gives it a +1, thus giving the game a nine.

I've played it once and I'll never play it again. You're manoeuvring your robots on auto-pilot 'till Lady Unfortunately decided that another played had to bump you in a hole or a laser beam so you would have to start all over again. Bad, bad, bad and frustrating.

UPDATE: Changed my rating from a 3.5 to a 2. Played it once more after all because there was no other game going on. Sigh... Less than 30 minutes in I regretted it... You're simply way too dependent on the cards you get dealt. And you get fewer cards as your wounds stack up, making it only worse. Some people may find that amusing, I found it extremely frustrating. I'm not a control freak by any means, but come on... Not being able to cross conveyor belts because you only get cards that let you turn or take 1 step? Wasted turn, huzzah! And you can't do anything about it. Not good in a racing game. Will absolutely never play this again.

Unique game that players of various skill levels seem to enjoy.  Gives you the ability to play a very short game, or one that lasts for days or longer.  Suffers from a pretty bad runaway leader problem, but because most players don't take it so seriously, it isn't as big of a deal as it would be in other games.  The real problem with the game ATM is it's OOP and expensive.  (Just acquired the AH version, and it's almost as good as the original).

Utterly and completely loathe this game.  would rather have me face smashed in by a wooden plank than sit through this again.

I use the term 'game' loosely.  I felt more like a spectator than a player.  It's like a slot machine or something; pull the handle and watch the thingy go round.  I am abosultely convinced you either have to be terribly drunk or have big watermelon brain to get any enjoyment out of this.

The others with me the few times I played loved it - really, it's just so bizzare that some give this a 10.

If you're a eurogamer - you'll HATE it. Passionately.

But for some reason, if you're a 100% total nerd; the monty python quoting genuine article, the real sterotype of the hollywood nerd, you'll likely love it.  I have no idea why, but that seems to be how it works.

Amazing when it first hit the scene, but appears a bit clunky and unwieldy compared to silky-smooth eurogames. A game where the concept and potential fun are greater than the implementation and actual fun. Novel ideas, brain-burning decisions and planning, and a great time to be had with the right group. Lends itself to overanalysis and programming can take forever, but the new edition addresses this with a countdown clock once players start to complete their programmed actions. Problem might be finding enough others that agree this is a good way to spend an evening.

Making and printing your own maps makes this game a ton more fun.  The chaos of lasers, rockets, flying off the game board, pushing opponents into pits, is just plain fun. Not perfect because the learning curve is steep and therefor it's not accessible for newbies. Also you have to take some of the randomness out of drawing cards to increase strategy and decrease luck. That means house rules.

My wife gave me free reign at the FLGS and I claimed this as my prize.  I am hoping that the chaos doesn't throw her off.  Our first session didn't go too well since we didn't play by all the rules (no damage) and we misread the rules about discarding program cards after setting up the registers.

Edit: Most recently, we have tried a variant on our Ricochet Robots board.  It didn't work too well.

I would say that this game really needs to be played with more than just two people.  Otherwise, you end up with a runaway leader problem that cannot be avoided.

This game works best when everybody is willing to have fun, (eg laughing at the misfortunes of the robot that is getting hammered even if it is their own robot).

Not bad, but the powering down mechanism could use some work.  Sitting out a turn, watching people play and getting damaged in the process isn't much fun.  Although, I completely understand the merit in designing the game this way.  If for no other reason, play this game to get used to the mechanic of Space Alert.


Editor's note:  I watched Brad Johnson win the world title at WBC.  It's like he and I are playing two different games.  I guess I just suck at this game.  Sorry if you disagree with my rating.

Game is in rough shape... but mostly complete. All but one of the cards is in good condition. One robot missing.
Half un-punched.

After 1 Play: An odd combination of meticulous planning and utter chaos.  If I were to play again I'd want to try the more complicated boards.

It's a hilarious game, but Robo Rally drags on until no one is having fun anymore. I don't like the game as a game - I like it as a toy to amuse people with.

During play I was having more fun shooting other robots and laughing about massive route failures than I was trying to get to the goals. Playing toward the objectives sucks the amusement right out of the session.

On a chaotic board full of walls, holes, lasers and conveyor belts, make a 5-card program for your robot to try to get closer to the checkpoint. Robots push and shoot and mess up eachother's programs in this hilarious superduperclassic. Absolute all-time favourite. Play time can be adjusted from 30 minutes to infinity, depending on how long track you make.

I actually have the 2005 reprint of this, but it wasn't in the list. As yet unplayed, but with the right quantity of players (4+) I can see it being great, chaotic fun.

Edit: Played this and it is no longer for trade. What did it for me was the simplicity of it. It's super easy to explain to a large number of people - all the cards do exactly what it says on them and there isn't an overwhelming amount of board elements on the easy maps. Definitely play with only 3 flags and one map though, or this will drag on horribly.

Great beer and pretzel game. Great pvpve elements. Do not play this game if you have trouble with determining left and right or, go ahead and play for the amusement of the other players

Rating after one play.  First play seemed so chaotic is was luck if I shot anyone or touched any flags.  We will see if it gets better with repeated plays.

Игра на программирование роботов. По-началу нравится, но потом понимаешь, что это филлер на 2-3 часа. Удивляет? Да. Бывает такое. Победитель здесь случаен и определяется везением. Общая хаотичность из разряда - "все делают что-то осмысленное, а получается непонятно что".

Even with 4, this is too chaotic. Maybe with 2 or 3 players??

I need to try this again. I must be missing something.

I like the idea, but the chaos (played with 8 players) made this more frustrating than fun. Rather watch than play. Action priority was a hassle, I'd try this game as an app.

This game needs to be played with the right group.  It takes a spacial awareness that some people simply don't have.  If you can turn things around in your mind, you'll have a blast with this game.

This would be much better as an automated computer game.  However, the player interaction is what makes this game enjoyable.  House variants help, too.

I have liked the idea of putting my 8-9 graders play this with 6-8 players during the last classes of the year in my computer science class.

Fast to learn, chaotic with many players. Have to play the harder maps too before I can say anything more about this.

Based on Avalon Hill edition

Nice, manic race game, with a definite sense of panic as you desperately try to figure out your moves before the last grains of sand drop from the timer.  Its a bit long for a 'lite' game though, which is a shame.
Also, not enamoured with the flag pieces either.  Couldn't they have printed the numbering on them instead of using stickers...

I don&#039;t find this game so entertaining. Sure, top-notch components and original rules, but the game is really about programming. No interaction with few players, too long syncronization with lots of them. This game will also give you serious headaches when the robot is on turning belts.

I don't enjoy this game generally and I'm not entirely sure why. I think it takes a lot of time for what is essentially a random number generator

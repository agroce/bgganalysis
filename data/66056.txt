GAME: The Rivals for Catan
RANK: 631

RATING: 3
Could never really get into it. It seemed to take the theme of Catan and rework it, but the system of cards in a geospatial aspect (which are normally two things that I like) just didn't click for me. I played 3 or 4 games and none of them were particularly fun for some unknown reason; just fell incredibly flat for us.

Rivals is a game we play once we are bored of everything else. Usually when we start playing rivals it means a new batch of games will not be far off. 

The flow and rules are a bit jarring so I catch myself checking the constantly. 

We could both playing this game in separate rooms and not even notice the other person isn't there. The additions and expansions probably help with this a little but we don't play it enough to try them.

I enjoyed it a lot before we started to get games with more interesting theme, art and gameplay. I do like the gameplay on this one though. My husband doesn't enjoy the game as much, I think it's because the theme and art doesn't appeal to him, once he is an artist, these 2 factors matters a lot.

Looks to be a much better version of the Settlers Card Game. The problem I had with the old version was that it took too long and dragged on and on at times. But this version lets you play the game you'd like to play by breaking the assortment of cards into multiple decks that you can mix and match to create the game you'd like to play. It works and I'm a fan. If you want a quick 30-40 minute game this will work for that. But if you'd like to explore some of the other cards in the game and have a deeper experience, this game can handle that as well. It won't be all things to everyone but it does a good job of having a lot of replayability and multiple styles of play wrapped up in what is essentially a medium lite family game.

My wife and I have been looking for a game that just the two of us could play because inviting a ton of people over is a lot of work.  So my wife found this little treasure and it is amazing.  We haven't played through all of the various game modes and still have to go through a couple of the expansions.  But that aside we love this game, and play it every time we get some down time for us.

Settlers for 2 players. The lack of more than 2 players makes it likely that there might be a run-away-leader. There is a lot of luck in the game, but that makes it a good title to play with non-gamers.

Another great Kosmos (well Mayfair for me) two player game.  Is compact, offers a variety of different ways to play and actually feels like Catan.  But most importantly it is strategic, dynamic, and a lot of fun.  The components are alright, but could be better.  In that while the art is great, the cards are shaped in a size which can't be currently sleeved, the insert is not fitted well and the box comes in a non-standardized size (I'd like to stack this next to Perry Rhodan and Dragonheart).  Nevertheless, Rivals packs a lot in its small package.  Featuring at least five different play modes (Basic, Era of Gold, Turmoil, Progress, Duel of the Princes, and any other combination of the theme sets), Rivals can be modified to be as quick, simple, or deep as one desires.  Shines most when played with all of its expansions, but also plays longest with their addition.  So overall aside from some component complaints and minor in-game fiddlyness, Rivals proves to be an excellent two player game.

Really not a Settlers of Catan game as it completely lacks the trading side; only similarity is that there are dice and the resources are the same. Good little game designed for two players that's pretty simple to play. Different decks help add some variety to the game.

Es un juego muy sencillo y que no requiere más que un puñado de cartas y un dado (incluido) para poder jugar. Es muy cómodo de transportar y puedes llevártelo fácilmente a casa de un amigo no jugón o de viaje para matar el gusanillo de "eurogames" durante las vacaciones. 

Por desgracia es demasiado largo para utilizarlo como filler y solo permite partidas de dos jugadores. Quitando ocasiones muy puntuales este juego pasará la mayor parte del tiempo cogiendo polvo en la estantería.

We tried this a long time ago, after loving and wanting to play Settlers of Catan, but for two people. 

This just feels like two player solitaire. The heavy card-knowledge dependency, also made this kind of a drag. Not a lot of interaction. It also felt like it went on for a really really long time. Not our cup of tea.

Only played with the basic cards so far but my girlfriend and I are really enjoying this one. Good for cafes but does take up quite a bit of space. Turns are very quick and I like the way that your little village builds up into a thriving city which expands out into the wilds.

After playing some of the theme decks we are enjoying this even more. However the space needed to play the larger point games is restricting us a bit at cafes.

An excellent 2-player card game, in both its ability to emulate the feel and mechanics of its more famous and expansive sibling, and the level of variety that you can implement with the setups of the Theme decks. So thankful there are three in the base game. There's also this tactile feel of how you lay out the cards for your Principality, and I enjoy rotating the Resources to keep easy track of how much you've got. LOVELY artwork, looks far better than anything I've seen of Settlers. Be warned that the game gets thinky enough for entry level players with just this core set.

The "basic game" is worthless and suffers from the same runaway leader problem as Settlers itself. The theme games seem to be a bit more balanced and worth playing (mostly due to needing more victory points), but the overall experience just doesn't appeal very much. It's a slow slog to victory, with a few options for clever play, but mostly lots of boredom. Not a bad game per se, but there's many more pleasant 2-player experiences.

I traded this away for Villa Paletti in the Essen 2012 math trade.

I'm usually against 'streamlining' of new editions of boardgames. Usually that means that games are dumbed down.

Much better than the Settlers of Catan in my opinion and I would say that if you search for a small game for 2 players, this is probably the best you can find.
Also comes with 2 expansions that multiplies the amount buildings that you can buy and therefore the strategies and the replayability.

I am impressed with how well the board game translates to this card format.  Rivals is a nice 2-player option when you have the Catan itch but not enough players.  The base game comes with three theme decks and the Dual of Princes variant adding variety and replayability.  It also travels well.

This game sat in my closet shrink wrapped for three years. What was I thinking? Throw in one of the expansions that come in this box and this game soars. 

Watching your network of cards grow making you become increasingly powerful and different than your opponent is so satisfying. 

A gripe about the game is that gathering resources can take a bit of time. I like to play with two dice instead of one giving the players more great choices faster.

Played the Introductory game three times in one day, which is really unusual for us.  Great experience, lots of fun -- my wife loved it.  But you hit a limit with the Intro game pretty quickly.  So it's great that it comes with three expansions; you can play any one, or all three together, for five different experiences out of the box.

Except...  Adding in one of the theme packs almost doubles the length of the game.  Our first game with a theme pack felt interminable, and we were longing for it to end.  Most of Klaus Teuber's games, while great, outstay their welcome by at least 30 minutes, and this is no exception.

I don't know where I'm going to go with this game.  If I play by the rules, I can choose to have either have a crippled, samey game which is over in a crisp 45 minutes, or a 75-minute game that is really, really interesting for only the first 45 minutes.  I suppose I'll try playing a Theme pack to fewer VP and see how that is.

Love it! Was not a fan of Catan and I bought this year's ago and finally played it last night. What a pleasant surprise! It remedied all the problems I had with Settlers: no bad starting position, no annoying thief, and no more sweet spots since you just roll one die to produce. There is also much more strategy and theme and the game features, much more effectively, the gorgeous artwork of artist, Michael Menzel. I will be playing this much more in the future as there are many card theme sets that can be added and interchanged with the core game. The base game includes 3 such "mini expansions". I bought one of the actual expansions today called Age of Enlightenment and it has 3 more of these sets so there is a lot of possibilities even out of the box. If you didn't like Settlers I would encourage you to give Rivals a go and see if that tickles your fancy.

My entry into the world of gaming with my girlfriend. 6 years ago, we enjoyed playing games like Catan with friends, and wanted something we could play on our own.

A fantastic game. Cheap, and easy to bring with you. It is a good gateway game, but have more than enough mechanics to catch and hold the interest of a gamer. 

plusses:
+ Agreeable theme that is easy to dive into
+ you build stuff, and see your civilization expand, which is very satisfying.
+ the take that mechanics are small enough to not scare away people who do not like that sort of things
+ even if you take a serious blow, the scores in the end will often be close, so you always feel like you have a chance to win
+offers a lot of variety
+a very good game/cash ratio

Minusses
- only a 2 player game
- dice are involved, and thereby you are partly under the control of mother luck. This is not as bad as it could be though, as there is a lot of ways you can influence things.


End note:
I would like to give this game an 8 as it is a really solid game, doing what it tries to do very well. I have found nothing i consider broken or in need of optimization and found a lot i think is clever. the reason why i don't give it a higher score is because, i am "only" enjoying myself when i play it. i like to play it, and expect i would always say yes to a game, even if i have just played 7 games in a row already. But when we are done, and i put the stuff back in the box, im not thinking back on the matches, and think about, what if i did XYZ or that sort of thing. The theme while fine, does not catch me after the game has been put away, so my mind wont wander around in its universe like a lot of other games themes have made me do.

An excellent game that neatly manages to create a game that is as engaging as Settlers, reminiscent of Settlers, and yet different enough to remain fun and interesting in it's own right.  I like it.  Can't wait to play the theme decks.

I've had a chance to play through all the theme decks now and I must say that I really like this game.  My favourite theme deck is probably the Era of Progress - and this is because my wife and I play together and it suits our play styles better.

This is a very good and enjoyable game - well worth the relatvely cheap price and a lot of fun!

RATING: 9.2
This is a great two player game, it feels a bit like chess mixed with some luck that can be appeased with strategy. Every piece has its role and needs to be played at the perfect time to get the best out of it. The mechanics are interesting and the replay-ability value is enormous. There are several paths to victory and several cards combining the three different sets that come with the starter set, plus the two expansions, that makes it difficult to master. Luck indeed plays a role, but fortunately, not a decisive one. Memorization more than luck plays a bigger part as part of the strategy. Also, the luck factor was minimized thanks to the clever mechanics and a well balanced and clever design of each card. The artwork is beautiful. It is certainly different than the original version but it definitely adds a different and equally valuable taste to it. The only con has to do with the materials of both, the box and the cards: Cheap cardboard horrible/cheap glossy paper and disposable plastic insert. The cards are too thin and may show wear sooner than later. It's a shame they Mayfair did not use linen card stock to print them out. The plastic tokens are awful and I already replaced them with a homemade wooden ones. One more con, doesn't play well with more than two ;-) Still, not enough to lower my rating. 
Best two player game thus far.

Satisfies the itch to play some Catan when there are only two people.  My wife enjoys Catan, but when it is just the two of us, it gets to the table.

It is perfectly reasonable for someone to accuse this game of being "multiplayer solitaire" - the fix for such an accusation is to allow trading, which my wife and I do when we play.  Accelerates the game, and makes it more interactive.

An absolute BEAST of a game. I love this, but it's super long and epic. But this is what makes it great. Get this affordable game and the affordable expansion packs, and you and your SO or best friend - whoever your main 2p gaming partner is - and have an epic game night with this game alone.

I'm hardly ever up for it lately, but the itch is coming back. Playing it feels like playing StarCraft or Age of Empires, with the building trees and road-city expansions and resource collecting and event cards. 

It's a total all-in-one strategy experience. Very ingenious in design. A shame it doesn't have more attention paid to it.

Only issue is something the simple road->city->road->city path is the quickest and more safe way to victory. Going for other points methods without road-> city expansions makes winning very unlikely. You need to always be making roads and cities, which can make it feels sometimes that your options are limited.

Needs more love... and better box/insert design from Mayfair.  The damn cards don't fit.  Setting that aside, there's a neat little modular system here that captures the Catan concept in a way that I actually prefer to Settlers.  Want more danger from the decks?  Sure!  Want more screwage?  There's a deck for that too.  Want to work on economic development in relative peace?  Can do.  Want to mix it all together?  Happily!

Months after receiving this from my BGG Secret Santa, we finally got to try it!  The Catan Card Game had always been one of our favorites (my husband even puts it in his top 10), so I figured this reimplementation would be a winner.  And it is.

The key difference to me in this edition is that resources are more plentiful, making purchases a lot easier.  That in turn speeds up the pace of the game considerably, so you can breeze through in less than an hour.  That's huge, as one of the main barriers to us playing its predecessor very often was the length.

There are some other changes which I could take or leave, but I do appreciate that it's got 3 expansions/modules already included to keep gameplay fresh.  We've already got another box expansion in the wings, so I know this will get played fairly often.

Muy estratégico, poder elegir que carta robar cada turno le da una profundidad estratégica muy amplia. Aunque dada al Análisis-Parálisis.
Las tres "expansiones" que lleva, le dan bastante rejugabilidad, y hacer una partida al juego completo tiene que ser una pasada, lo tengo pendiente.
Si no fuera porque este juego es para 2, y el catan para 3-4, diria que es bastante superior. Pero como no se pisan el nicho, todo está perfecto :D
Una cosa mala, y bastante mala... el dado. Un solo dado hace que no haya distribución (bueno, si, uniforme) y todo es completamente aleatorio. Puedes estar perfectamente toda la partida sin robar trigo, y no poder hacer casi nada. Creo que es el único fallo que tiene este juego, y el motivo por el que tiene esta nota. Pero bueno, eso es una seña de identidad de los juegos de Teuber, que un dado te pueda joder toda la partida...

This is my favorite 2 player game. I love how you build up your city with buildings, roads, heroes, ships, etc.; it really gives you a sense of accomplishment. The event and resource dice add a nice bit of randomness to the game, but not too much. The theme is great; it feels like Catan, only much deeper and ultimately more satisfying. Plus, there are a few different scenarios to play though, so the game doesn't get stale.

This game is great for those who like Catan but want a version that will play with two players. We actually like it better than Catan as you get something no matter what the die rolls. It is a little on the long side. We still find it interesting throughout, but some players might expect something a little shorter for a card game version of a bigger game. I would guess it takes almost as long as Catan to play.

The Rivals for Catan is a fun two player game I picked up after having Catan in my collection and not being able to play alone with my wife. It was a pretty cheap game, and I didn't have big expectations, but we really enjoyed this game and got into it for a while. There is a slight learning curve, but once you get the hang of it the base game and the expansions that come in this box are tons of fun.

Slightly better than the original base game and do consider it to be an upgrade - to 1.5 though, not 2.0!   They have staged it nicely to allow newbies to learn it easier.  

My favorite aspect of the new version over the old is that now you have more control over the types of cards you draw.  There have also been a few rough edges smoothed out that streamline the game.

I normally enjoy games with conflict, but some reason when players take things from one another in this game it just feels SO MEAN.  I should probably avoid the "Era of Turmoil" theme deck, aka "Era of I built the Hedge Tavern and now I'm gonna be a dick."

Very satisfying two player game which scratchs a city/civ building itch for me. Definitely not a two player version of Catan, in fact there's no trading resources at all really. Building an engine and managing resources is the focus here, with some interesting deck manipulation opportunities available too. The basic game is more like an intro/teaching version; playing with any/all of the expansions is the full game experience. Love the way resources are tracked by turning the location cards, very clever!

I prefer this to settlers. this is a decent two player game which is both easy to learn and has some depth. You build a settlement using resources you get from dice rolls. Thats about the extent of its similarity to its parent game though. The game gives you more choice on which strategy of VPs to follow and has an interesting random event deck.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Interesting game.  I don't really feel that it has all that much to do with Catan except for rolling for resources.  The goals of the game and the strategy are differentiated far enough to consider this its own thing.  

As its own thing, it's pretty good and entertaining.  It serves its purpose well as a 2-player game, though it's not heavy enough to be your go-to; more like Rivals will be your end-capper at the end of a night with someone who's lingering around.

Given how old this is, I won't bother with an overview.  Suffice to say that my rating is only based on one play of the base game and expansions may address my concerns.

Those concerns, of course, are that nothing is worth value except for settlements/cities and the army/trade tokens.  It seemed, after some time, that it was totally pointless to build anything on the side unless it facilitated, somehow, building another city.  This is where trade ships became useful, but I found that the small bonuses provided by heroes wasn't enough to warrant wasting any further resources putting them into play.  The meat of the game, at least in the base set, is to build up your road and settlements as quickly as possible.  Yes, some of the development cards help to facilitate such an endeavor, but by the end of it, all you really need to do is ignore the majority of them and simply focus on settlements.  That's not to say you should ignore the development cards, but rather after two or three of them, forget the rest.  Just power on through.

It sucked the fun out of the game a little bit when I realized and succeeded at this strategy, so hopefully the expansions add a little depth where it is sorely lacking.

I bought Rivals of Catan rather than Settlers because I generally play with 2.  Even though it's a card game it feels like a board game to me as it takes up a good sized portion of my table and requires plenty of careful thought to do well.  The variability of the 3 different sets of cards makes this good value with high deployability.  TRADED

Looks like we made some mistakes with the rules on our first play.  I am guessing once we straighten that out and add the expansions to the basic game it will go up in rating. 

Edit:  We've played this 4 times, adding an expansion each time we play.  It's now firmly in our For Trade pile and I do believe we have finally learned the valuable lesson, Catan is not good with two people (no matter how much we want it to be)

Juego bonito y entretenido con el que Reyes y yo hemos pasado muy buenos ratos al principio de la afición pero que hace tiempo que ve poca mesa por tener opciones mejores, aunque Reyes me lo sigue pidiendo de vez en cuando. Tomando la mecánica principal del Catán de activación de terrenos a partir de tiradas de dados, para mi gusto lo mejora consiguiendo un juego mucho más divertido. Lo mejor, para mí, son las bellísimas ilustraciones de Menzel.

A ver si pronto tenemos un pequeño revival de este juego, que hace mucho que está guardado en el cajón.

I was underwhelmed by the previous Catan Card Game, but the proposed improvements gleaned from a quick rules read suggest this should be a better game, with an incremental introduction to the card sets rather than the single start with all cards version of the previous game.  (11/9/11). UPDATE: Whilst only one play of the game, it is quite clear there has been some good refinements made to the original game. A definite improvement to the previous version, and lot forward to my limited opportunities to play this again (Rating 7: 14/1/13). UPDATE: Ah, the problems of not having a family that don't board game! (7.184, Sept 16)

I replaced my original SoC:CG with RfC simply because my original set was missing cards. I'm glad I did anyway. RfC greatly speeds up the action of the game and cuts down on the time spent doing mundane activities. Resource are aplenty here and the race for VPs feels more intense. Love the Menzel artwork (though I had no problems with the original). I think the rule updates work great and does this game the justice it deserves. This is how a re-implementation should be! Don't be tricked: this game has a lot more going on in it than the Catan board game. This isn't simply a variant but a very enjoyable, strategy card game which becomes further impressive with all the available expansion decks.

[b]Why I got rid of it:[/b]

I enjoyed it for a while but soon tired of it. The problem is that you need to play quite a few games of each theme deck to be able to play it well and by that time you've gotten bored of it.

It's a fairly interesting adaptation of the Catan theme to a two player card game but ultimately it's not really the kind of card game I enjoy playing.

Seems as though the starting cards are a bit biased towards the red side. Other than that, a nice, barterless, 2 player adaptation of Catan that takes much less time to set up and half the time to play.

I've played this 6 or so times so far, twice with the progress expansion, and I can say I think it's an incredible game and that more plays and incorporating the expansions will only yield more enjoyment.  Quickly becoming one of my favorite two-player games.  This beats the pants off of regular Catan.

Update: 9/29/13
Have now played this quite a few more times--Duel of Princes.  It's easily one of my favorite two player games.  The artwork is gorgeous, the strategy is so varied, and there's not necessarily only one path to victory--but make sure you build settlements as least as fast as your opponent.  The only downside (minor) to this game is that it takes quite a bit of space to play, and so is not very easily played out in public.

Update: 10/7/13
Just upgraded this to one of my only other 10s (along with Agricola, Mansions of Madness, Heroscape, and M44).  With the variety of expansions, the diverse paths to victory, and the unique engine building, this has become our second favorite.  Definitely worth picking up Age of Darkness and Age of Enlightenment.

Nice components, theme is well reflected in the ability of the cards, tight score every game. In fact so tight that luck ends up almost determining the winner. The thematic decks are nice, except for The Era of Turmoil, which I found too confrontational. 

After playing a dozen times the replayability seems quite compromised. The event cards start to become annoying, and together with the dice rolls present an unnecessary element of randomness to the game. Nothing pisses me off more than having a resource stolen from me. This kind of "take-that" is childish and jeopardizes the gaming experience.

This is the new two player card game for [thing=13][/thing] and I like many of the ideas in this. There is production for every player on every die roll and many of the concepts of the main game are cleverly introduced in this and usually in a better matter. Since there is production on every number, there is a constant tension in the game, much like a tug-o-war. 

In the box, there are also three themed decks, which introduce more complexity to the game. While the introductory game is a good way to learn the basic cards, the themed decks add more strategy and interactions between the players.

The card art is good, price is small and I expect to play this a lot, so I consider this a great buy for me.

[b]Introductory game[/b] 7x: I play the intro game with people the first time, since it is good for learning the cards which is needed to form a good strategy. With repeated plays I will go for the more advanced options. It is good for what it is, but there are only so many ways you can build you principality and it is too much luck based.

[b]The era of gold[/b] 1x: There is definately more strategy and choice with this themed set and I expect the same for the other ones too. The question is when you are going to switch gears to go for points.

[b]The era of turmoil[/b] 0x: More emphasis of strength advantage and harassing the opponents. Haven't played yet.

[b]The era of progress[/b] 1x: A friendlier setup than the other two, focusing on building up.

[b]The duel of the princes[/b] 0x: Game with all the themed decks. Looking forward to try this.

Fun two player card game using similar mechanics to Catan, but adds a bunch of variety.  Great for two players.  Only small complaint is that it takes up a lot of space for such a small game.  Also the resource cards spin too freely on most tables.  And theres a small run-away leader effect. I guess that's 3 small complaints.  Lots of fun though.

Also, this is REALLY fun on iOS!

This is certainly an improvement over the old "Catan Card Game". The base game was sacrificed to become an introductory game that is only worth as such, but three theme decks are included. I like it that all city expansions, i.e. cards with victory points, are in the theme decks, so that a player can no longer win by focusing just on the basic set. The rules have been stramlined, and the artwork by Michael Menzel definitely is another improvement. My only gripe is that the playing time was not shortened very much.

Based on Catan theme, The Rivals for Catan strengthens card playing mechanics. The variety of cards made the game more interactive and strategic. Because of various cards functions, it is hard to grasp the game aspect in a few games. Until memorizing all of the cards and reciprocal actions among cards, players usually feel hard to understand the principle of game. The Rivals for Catan increased strategic fun, as well as the decreased the game accessibility.

RATING: 7
A game that allows for considerable variation in strategy, although it's often more about what to do with resources and options you have, rather than those you don't. I love the system for accruing resources, with rotating cards to track volumes. I am not a fan of how the rules allow searches through draw stacks, as that aspect seems to unhealthily encourage memorising draw pile order. Still, overall, a very enjoyable game of engine building, resource management, dice chucking and light player interaction.

I was surprised by how good this game was. It had the same feel as Settlers but stood alone as it's own game and was surprisingly strategic.

I really wanted to like this game.  It has nice components, an interesting range of cards and effects, and yet a quick and light two-player game.  However, after playing it several times, my friend and I came to the conclusion that it really suffers from runaway leader syndrome.  Once one person pulls ahead, it's pretty impossible for the other person to catch up.  And so luck of the draw in the first couple rounds can pretty much determine the game.  And since it's a two-player game, you can't even team up to slow down the lead player.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (April 2014)

I don’t think Settlers for Catan is a bad game, however I almost never want to play it as I feel there are a lot of better options out there. Due to this, I was reticent to try Rivals of Catan but I was pleasantly surprised by this game :D.

It has many similarities with the parent game (obviously), but it is also very fun and quick to play. The rules are easy to grasp. I LOVE that the game come with 3 expansions in the base box. There is almost no down time, a big plus for me.

I’m a bit worried about replayability as the first plays seem obvious (build more roads, then settlements, upgrade them to cities), still the game can change (I hope) with the added Era cards and the advantage tokens. It has a lot of luck but (so far) I feel the game has a lot of strategy too. I will play more to see if this is an issue for me. 

Bottom line, I want to play it again soon to form a better opinion of the game. It has the potential to go up in my personal ratings and I will probably buy it as I’m sure my GF would like it.

RATING: 8.5
Catan's two-player edition has different mechanics: one die determines the resource(s) gained by both players, another die determines if there's an event, and production expands based on what you've already laid out. It's a smooth product that stands on its own, and comes with three "ages" to very up the game in four different ways. Well worth it for nights when you just can't get a third person with "wood for sheep."

BIG PLUS: strong mechanics, ease of learning & play
MINUS: square cards get bent easily, bigger than normal dice
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I want to get into this one more. It has a very intriguing series of thematic decks, and I think works quite well as a two player replacement for Settlers. However, I am not yet used to how slowly one acquires resources via the conventional method (of rolling a dice).

RATING: 7
This really takes the basic theme from Settlers and expands it nicely.  I enjoy it, but am surprised by how often my wife requests it.  We have played with the expansions from early on, so I don't know how much they really add but do enjoy the variety.  We haven't yet played Duel of the Princes.

Very cut-throat - your opponent can take your resources away. When playing Duel of Princes, sometimes it may be mad rush to find that only card you need. We changed rules such that whenever we can search a deck for cards only the top 5 cards can be taken. Lots of luck needed. A great theme. Expansions are needed for lots of replayability.

I just had to get the streamlined version and I'm quite happy with it. A lot has stayed the same and a lot has changed. Art is new and fresh and some mechanisms have been bettered or even corrected. Somehow the playing experience is lacking, however. The game end lacks some of the tension of the Settlers Card Game, the three expansions feel like lacking synergy, good cards and possibilities for reasonable comboing, the city expansions are cheaper and weaker. Possibly this would be better suited for tournament play, but for regular playing I think the old game might just be better.

Here's the thing with this game: it's way simpler than the instructions lead you to believe.  I actually found the complexity of the instructions overwhelming at first, until I finally just tried playing through the game with a friend and then looking things up as we went, and we both realized it wasn't that bad at all.  

That being said, I'm not sure it's a great game.  It's fun enough, it works fine, it's well balanced; but it just doesn't draw you in the way the original Settlers of Catan does.  So while I still enjoy playing it, I don't go out of my way to suggest a round of it, and I've never finished one game and thought "let's try that again."

One other issue that's rather annoying: the box is not well designed for holding the various game cards.  I highly recommend purchasing a number of small plastic game bags before unboxing and using them to sort the different card types or era cards.

Not very sure about this game. It's not a very fast one and it occupies plenty of space on the table (so it's not trip friendly). It comes with 3 expansions though, so maybe it's just about finding the right combination, but every play we've had feels too long, and the winning is hard to get, even the last point!

It's a good game, but it doesn't feel like Catan, that's for sure.

I think the changes are for the better.  I like the idea of a shorter basic game, which sometimes all we have the time or energy for.  Compared to the original Settlers Card Game, it's also easier to get resources, as well as get cards you can actually use.  

Plus, for a mere $20 you get an expandable card game that allows you to build a little civilization engine and watch it run.

Attractive civ-light with limited upgrade, economic engine-building, and adversarial elements.  Fun - at first blush appears a bit luck heavy, and seems like it might end too soon.  There are definite luck-mitigating elements, though, and if played to a higher victory point goal, the game seems that it might result with a runaway victory.  Time will tell if the luck-mitigating elements are sufficient.

Very well thought out card game. Bought to bring along on holiday, for which it is perfect. Needs some space to play, so not that good to play whilst actually on the road.

Seems to play faster than the regular Catan Card game.

Someone on a thread about crokinole boards said that: "Those wooden Catan tokens are EXCELLENT for decreasing the length of time it takes to play the 2-player Catan Card Game by 1/2 (they should be standard issue with that game, you put tokens on the region cards instead of rotating them, seriously, try it),"

This entry has links to a scoring track: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/592213/the-enemy-within-a-review-of-the-rivals-for-catan

"Note for those who own the original Catan Card Game: Though I've never played it I did some research, including reading the Klaus Teuber blog I linked up top. It looks like if you have the original + expansions, and enjoy them, there's no need for you to upgrade. The new game is a slight retooling of the original with a focus on easier initial understanding of gameplay and quicker game overall."

1-22-15--We are so enjoying this game!  Always wanted to like Settlers of Catan, but never enjoyed the play.  Always seemed to drag and many times there was nothing you do because of the dice rolls.  With this game, those issues are fixed and it's very fun.  We played several times with the base game then several with the Era of Gold and today tried Era of Turmoil for the first time.  All are very fun!  Once we get familiar with Turmoil and the next included expansion we will play with all of three and see how that goes.  Then I have the other 2 separate expansions!  So I believe we will be entertained by this game for a long time!  The only caveat is that is 2p only.  It's a fairly long game (1 1/2 to 2 hrs) so I guess it's a blessing that it isn't intended for more players.  :)

My fiancé and I bought this game because we enjoy Settlers of Catan but struggle to get three people around the board game table as often as we would like!

Rivals is a great adaptation and gives us a nifty two player game that is quick to set up and play. While still giving the player some of the settlers resource management and strategy elements.

I really enjoy this game and would recommend it to all of those looking for a good two player game.

02/06/2013: This is a two-player only version of Settlers of Catan and a remake of the Catan Card Game.  I think this is a very good re-implementation of the original.  It provides that same basic concept of gaining resources (without the trading) and using them to build up the landscape of Catan with roads, cities, and various other buildings that provide additional actions and options for your turn.  The game can suffer from the same unlucky die rolls as the original, but I usually feel like I can do something on basically every turn.  I picked this up after enjoying Catan but not having the opportunity to play it because of not having enough players.  This fills that niche very nicely.

Teuber took his card game and streamlined it along with all of it's many expansions into one big package.  It comes with a number of scenarios which tailor towards specific styles of play.  Overall it works well but it just didn't excite me as perhaps it may of years ago.  Like many two player games this one can be frustrating if you get behind early: especially when you're opponent gets strong enough to just start taking the resources and buildings that you build.

*June 2012* I love this game. The different themes keep it varied and as long as noone APs, it plays fairly quickly. Pretty tactical with a bit of strategic abilities.... if you're willing to pay the resources bonus for them!

*edit* A really good game but takes longer than its worth and uses a lot of table space. Less of both would make this near perfect. I used two dice in my last game (with the roller allowed to choose one and both players use it), it quickened up the game but made it less exciting. 

*edit Sept 7, 2012* Played another game after a few months. Used one die, game takes longer but still less than 90 minutes and still fun. Played Era of Progress, which is actually a good engine building theme. Game is not multiplayer solitaire, I and my partner were fighting a lot over the strength and scale tokens. I won, 12-10, very close game. 

Great game, I should break it out more. Now that I'm happy with my collection and can put stuff on the backburner, I hope to play all my games a lot more.

My first impression is that they "fixed" many ways of abusing certain cards in the previous version of the Settlers of Catan card game. Unfortunately, this makes for quite a bunch of uninspiring incremental cards (incremental as in not really generating enough change to the board). I'd advocate getting the old version if possible.

Another caveat: all sets of cards (roughly 3-4 per box) can be distinguished by the backside. This makes the old deckbuilding approach less attractive since you can pretty much guess what you get (at least if you optimize for it).

Finally, I preferred the old art, e.g., the look of a production amplifier between two matching landscapes (or even with the correct fleet next to it).

This could be a really great game if they came out with a new version. As it is, this game is VERY slow going. Resource generation simply isn't fast enough, and I almost wish you had twice as many fields working for you at each settlement/city. The base engine of the game is really good, however, and with some streamlining, this could be a really solid version of Catan. I really dig the different building abilities, the way the "map" unfolds as you build, and the various events that happen when you roll dice. It just doesn't move along at a fast enough clip, and as a result feels like a 45 minute to an hour game when it shouldn't go beyond 30 minutes. I have yet to play anything that has surpassed the original in this family of games, unfortunately, but this one comes close.

Never thought I'd see the day when I could play Catan with one close friend. Because let's face it, bartering in a two-person game is boooorrrriiinng.

Enter Rivals! Randomizing elements govern stockpiling - and losing - and trading - and tipping the balance of power. Dice, cards, and your own made-before-you-knew-enough choices affect outcomes every turn, and except for the slightly slow first few turns, play rapidly turns into building and rebuilding forces of new elements (heroes, celebrants, market power, intellectual power) while using the classic resources to call into play characters, ships, buildings, and more that set you racing to build up to victory.

Three expansions come with the base game, and each takes time to explore. There are two more sets of three expansions in Age of Darkness and Age of Enlightenment. The expansions can be mixed and matched or better yet, chosen randomly in groups of 2-3 to present new combinations of challenges and advantages. It's all the strategy you love about Catan, yet you can play it over and over with your partner of a decade without getting bored, because no matter how well you know each other, the dice, the decks, and the decisions will keep you guessing until that final victory flag hits the table.

As with all Catan games, this can be used to teach management skills and to encourage developing a range of strategies for problem-solving. There are just a few issues to smarten up:

1) The Duel of Princes, while it provides a shorter and more variable game for experienced players, eliminates too many draft strategies by isolating the players' draw piles, and it has too few event cards.

2) Extraordinary Sites are only really useful if you can add them to a settlement that already has two buildings/units or a city that has four - they carry no point value, affect few other cards, and require a lot of luck to be able to use - so why use precious building space?

3. Please go directly to any smart female gamer for instructions on improving strength/celebration ratios on heroes and for general input on gender in the game.

It's just heartbreaking to see beards on *every* player with significant strength points while women carry almost nothing but celebration harps. Isn't it time to let our imaginations catch up to our hopes? Isn't it time to make games like this friendly to our strong daughters? I don't want to have to explain that the card art doesn't show women as women are or should be, but rather an artist's conception of what women were... or worse, should be and will get teased if she's not, or should want to become at any surgical or sacrificial cost.

RATING: 7
Some meat here, even in the basic game, and more added to the bones with the different modules in the box.  This is a thinky and fairly deep game, not a light and easy report of Catan, and there's a hefty amount of thinking to be done in the late game, especially keeping track of all the synergies.  We'll have to see how long it takes us to get to the Duel of the Princes, but there are probably several plays left in this, even if we will have to progress with patience and care.

RATING: 7
Good game to start out with, relatively simple.  Definitely recommend for those who want a game that isn't too finicky or complex but yet still has some strategy.

Fun to satisfy the itch to settle a prosperity and develop a civilization.

Preference in this is to steer away from PvP slash and burn mechanics and go towards other expansions instead.

The Rivals For Catan does a good job of condensing the feel of Settlers down for 2 players, but without the trading and the movement of the thief, the game is much more solitary. Unfortunately, too many turns are wasted doing nothing more than rolling the dice and passing.

Played a handfull of times in 2013 and 2014. So far only with the base set. 

Played the iPad version a lot and that helps getting a good feel of the cards in the base set. 
Very good version. Pity only the full base game is included and the two expansions are not available. 
It could be even better with some interface improvements and a fix for the occasional crash. 
Improvements: Being able to change speed of card turning (up and down), better visibility of what your opponent did (selecting a card or drawing a card, sometimes I didn't watch and missed what the opponent did, for example buy or draw and from which pile), being able to see costs of cards when other screens are open, an undo option/track back (pressed the wrong button so many times now).

I don't know if this is just flavor of the month, but this just blows Settlers out of the water!

This game seems to fix all the annoying bits of chaos involved in Settlers, but it keeps the fun parts of dice rolling and city building, while adding more!

Now granted, I have yet to play any Catan expansions, but I got this game because I needed a solid, fast, and easy 2 player game.  This game hits on all cylinders.  When you or your opponent rolls the dice it helps since every one starts with 6 resources.  The game is extremely light weight and it's one of those games that is really easy to teach while playing.  In fact, when I teach it I just tell them it's a city building game where you collect resources, erect buildings, hire heroes, and create trade ships.  And then we just start and I explain the steps as we go and by turn 3 they're off and running.

A much tighter and cleaner game than its predecessor, with many of the rules problems satisfactorily resolved. The in-the-box expansions are perfect to twist the gameplay in different directions without resorting to the sprawling mess of cards that the original Catan Card Game suffered from.

That is hands down the best way of playing Settlers with only 2 players.

Or just call it "the streamlined Settlers Card Game". It's really by about 85% identical to its predecessor. Some names were changed, it has a new artwork and some cards were taken out, while very few new ones were added. Some useful rule changes. All in all, a lot of its predecessors nastiness has been taken out.

We are really starting to enjoy this game initially we were a little put off by it when we first got this game because we went into it with the wrong expectations. The intro game to 7 points is easy and fairly short, but the theme decks offer a bit more of a challenge. The theme decks play to 12 point and are a mid weight in strategy and depth, which adds a significant amount of length to play time. A balance mix of luck and strategy with a little bit of player interaction but nothing too cut throat. Highly enjoyable as you plan and build your principality to greatness.

A great 2-player card game with the Catan theme.  I think it is more strategic than regular Catan (base game), and the expansions are cool.  I would say it is just as good as San Juan but doesn't get much love.

RATING: 7.5
2 player city-building card game with Settlers of Catan mechanisms.

Intro game is good to learn the ropes, but the real game is with the included Themes and with expansions.

RATING: 6
What I like:
- Light civ-building, good mechanics
- Can be played with minimal attacks
- Excellent value for the money

What I don't like:
- Even with a "friendly" deck, there were a couple attacks
- As with special-ability card games, you need to learn the deck
- I generally prefer games with a fixed end point rather than a race to a number of points
- 75-90 minutes is about twice as long as it should be

I guess the game was about what I had expected from the reviews. It was (mostly) pleasant, but not overly exciting. It was easy to learn, and my first game wasn't overly long, but my second seemed to drag. It seems like a multi-player version would be easy to create, so I'm not sure why they have stuck with the 2p format. I would probably rate a 3-4p version a full point higher.

I would put the weight around 2.2, a bit lower than the BGG-voted 2.4. I think it's simpler than San Juan, not more complex.

Rating dropped from 7 to 6 after a second play, due to the length.

So far only the base game but looking forward to introducing the theme sets. Base game is good and tight and I like that you try to steer your strategy to suit your initial hand. Optimising your hand opens up options which keeps the game engaging and fun. My partner also really liked the game which is an added bonus!

Now played all the expansions that come with the base game individually, and also all together for the full experience. Great game, really enjoyed playing it Can get very competitive once players get familiar with what comes in the different decks and frantically try to look for specific cards to either block the opponent or give themselves a massive boost. The fact that players can't win on all fronts (military, science or economy) makes for really interesting decisions.

Really neat take on the Catan premise.

An excellent two-player-only game!  Like in regular Catan, I enjoy the resource management aspect of the game.  It's just slightly different in this game (no trading).  I like how the special benefits of the cards integrate with symbols on the die.  This makes you want to add cards to your tableau that will help you when a certain symbol appears.  Very nice card game!

Okay tableau building and resource management game that gets a bit dull and this is not helped by a very boring and unnecessarily fiddly graphic design.

An enjoyable "wife" game. I worry about the long term survivability of the components though. I'm afraid they will wear out and I'll be forced to find another copy.

edit: increased rating to 8. I find myself enjoying this more with the expansions and the more I play it the more I like it. It's actually better than catan. 

Like race for the galaxy, knowing the cards better than your opponent can be an important part of the victory path. As such experienced players will usually beat inexperienced players.

There is something oddly relaxing and pleasant about this game. It's one of our "comfort" games.

*** Traded for Fairy Tale ***


$19

I am playing with the house-ruled 2 resource dice variant and the game still feels slow. The whole first game was played without tension, which I don't quiet understand. It is not that there isn't player interaction, it is just kind of boring to throw dice and never get the resource you want. With the dice-dependent mechanics, it was clear mid-way through the game that my girlfriend is going to win the game. I will give it a bit more time to see if strategy can come out on top more than just the dice rolls.

After 2nd play of the game, upped from a 5 to 6.

Score came back down to 5 after two more lack luster plays.

--- Update ---
Traded in a math trade. I couldn't be happier to get rid of this game. This game gave me buyer's remorse for 9 months straight. I'd trade this game for really anything.

It's an interesting game, but the "chance" activities really seem to interrupt the flow of the game, and bad dice and the raiders really slap you around. Its a cool little game, and I love everything about it but the seemingly random impact of the dice and activities cards. It is a game that is alternately engrossing and frustrating. I'm left with the feeling that it's a nice game, but not one that I enjoy.

What I remembered from the 'old version' was that there were some overpowered cards. When playing with only the base game, that problem didn't seem to occur. 

What still might be an issue is the number of villages. It's even and if 1 player can get 1 more then the other, he will have 4 more resource cards and have a far better chance of winning.

I liked this game for a few reasons.  It was very similar to the original Catan that I have enjoyed in the past but the game mechanics were more simplified, it was easy to adapt to and the game play went fast.  The only bad things I saw were you need a fairly large game space to play (you spread your cards out in a "flower" type design and you were limited to 2 players. (which is both a bad and good trait depending on your needs)  2nd, if you enjoy the aspect of "trading" with other players then you will be disappointed as its not a part of the play mechanics.  I can't say why but I did not like the "hero" cards.  We'll see how I feel about that as I play more.

I had lost a lot of interest in Catan over the past number of months and had moved onto other games but this brought me right back into the world of Catan in a way that felt fresh.

I'm not sure how I feel about this game. It's pretty quick to play, has good production values and (maybe?) a degree of strategic options... but I can't shake the feeling that it is also random. 

In my first play I one simply because I had 2 event cards in my starting hand that allowed me to build a road and town quicker than my opponent, which in turn netted me more resources each turn, which let me build more roads and towns and on and on. Only at the very end, when my opponent's buildings and my consistently unlucky die rolls and event draws held me still for 3 full turns did he ever come close to catching up. Event then, it was only a delay: I eventually got my final VP and he was still 3 behind...

Elegant 2 player game which does a great job of capturing the feel of Settlers in a card game, for better and for worse.  The game feels very random to me, although the randomness feels more spread out among both players.  Lovely art.

I'm not sure quite how I feel about this card-game version of Settlers. To be honest, it feels like rather more than that - even with just the basic deck it seems there is much more going on than in the board game, and the game comes with 3 other themed decks (which we've not tried playing with yet, and almost certainly never will since we just don't play this game now). It's a 6 for now as I can't say I'll be begging for another game of this any time soon, but it might grow on me :) (That looks unlikely now though - we've not played since that first game in early 2012, and it's not a game I can see me ever requesting.)

One thing that I do find inferior to the board game is that you roll a single D6 for resource production, not 2. This makes everything flat and boring, as all numbers are equally likely to come up. There's none of the dilemma that comes in the board game where you're not sure whether to build on resources you really need on poor numbers, or ones you don't on better ones. (Well, actually, the latter is going to be better in virtually all cases, given that you can trade. So that was a poor explanation. But I can't get past the feeling that a single die makes things that bit more boring.)

A good game that stays true to the feeling of regular Catan while bringing in more aspects and strategies to the game. It's also quite a bit quicker than Catan so it's more often the choice for my 8 yr old and I if we are playing games alone.

I'm a big fan of normal Catan, so gave Rivals a chance wondering how it could work for 2 players.

The theme of the original game is certainly there. As are various costs/buildings and even strategies to a point. The additions are also usefully done. 

I don't feel it is an overly exciting game and the interaction between the two players is normally minimal (I haven't played much with the attack cards though). Having said that, I do find it a reasonably fun game. Though games can go on a bit sometimes. Maybe I like it more than I should, just due to the Catan theme?

Catan is a good game. This is a better game; albeit only a two player game. Of course this comment is only my opinion, but I find this game less luck based than the normal Catan. Since no matter what rolls, you end up with something in your pocket.
I haven't tried out all the expansions as of yet, but I can't wait to do so! I really recommend this game for anyone who loves card games; it is its own game separate from Catan.

I like that they made a two player version of this game, which I adore (I really think they could make the full game two player if they tried...turns out they do....Struggle for Catan...which is what we replaced this with), but it requires a lot of room for a card game.  Set up is much faster, though, which is nice, but anymore I always go for Struggle, not Rivals, hence why we weeded this.  (JW)

Great two person game!  Play it with my wife all the time.  However, we both have competitive streaks and this game is pretty unforgiving.  If the dice aren't going your way and you aren't getting the resources you need, you are going to get slaughtered.  The game mechanics that allow you to directly 'attack' your opponent are pretty powerful too, so if one person gets on top of that it can get ugly.  Anywho, it's a great two person variety of Catan that is pretty easy to pick up.  Like most games you have to play it once or twice to get a grasp of strategy.

There are moments where The Rivals for Catan feels as amazing as the board game upon which it's based. It does such a good job at redefining the full experience for two players, as well as stripping away the fluff that gummed up the Catan Card Game. On the other hand, it isn't nearly as intuitive or elemental as the board game, and the endless focus on new modules means this game is producing content much faster than it is utilizing it. Still, it's really good.

The original catan card game was amazing. This is a very, very bad reimplementation of this game.

The setting is totally different from the original medieval one and apparently oriented at some book noone cares about. All the characters, which used to be shiny knights and the like, are now lumberjacks and other people that look like they could live in the current time without attracting anyone's attention. 
They also have ridicoulus modern names now, really making it impossible to play this game due to the cringe factor.

And last, but not least, apparently every army has it's female quota now - about 50% of your 'warriors' will now be female civilians with a small knife in their hand.
This game has sadly become a joke.

When you try to ignore that failure (which is impossible to achieve), game mechanics haven't changed in any relevant way, there definetly has not been any improvement. It's also not significantly worse, to be fair, it's just become ugly and ridicoulus.

I have only ever played a partial game of the original Settlers and it didn't interest me at all - found it to be highly overrated.

This, however,  plays a bit differently and it was something I'd be interested in giving another go 'round - especially with the opportunity to try one of the theme games.  Not something I would specifically seek out, but one that I would play again if offered.

Probably my favourite games. Very deep, multiple ways to victory, great theme, drama, strategy, tactics. I like it very very much. Gets even better with the expansions thrown in.
In this expansion, I like the Barbarians expansion best. Very tense, delivers a nice dilemma situation of facing a growing threat the more one expands.

The card holders sold in the Catan shop by Cosmos (?) are great too. They make orderly play much easier, even with clumsy people.

Far superior to the original game. It has a much shorter playing time, and is significantly more tailorable to the style play preference (building vs aggression).  It is easier to cycle through the cards to get what you need, but there still is enough friction that it is exciting when you accomplish what your were hoping to do.

Surprisingly good Catan based card game. The beginner base deck is fairly simplistic but a light way to kill an hour. The game is much better when the 3 'ages' are used. That said, the game is easy to break by drawing the key card from each age. The player who gets these first will dominate and win. The game when 'ages' are included can last between 1-3 hours.

Art work is beautiful, but the game is still too much dependent on the luck of the die rolls and the luck of the stack you draw from -- or pay to look through. The Mint is still too powerful a card, and the fact that there are 2 now doesn't help when it cost me 8 resources to search for and finally find it! No catch up mechanism, either. The game strengthens the leader.

1 play, basic game.

It's been so long since I played the original 2er card game that I don't really remember how this version is different! I think, though, that we were cycling through cards faster than I remember from the previous version.

The introductory game is ... basic -- essentially, just settlers converted to card game form, playing to only 7VP.

Looking forward to trying the expansion themes (even though with the original version, we bought all the expansions packs but only played one, maybe 2 of them!)

This game is alright. Feels like Catan without most of the bad stuff. It's one of those Euros based around mitigating luck, and there's nothing wrong with that.

I don't like "The Settlers of Catan" (although truth be told, I've never met them).  I especially don't like playing Settlers with only 2 players.  I'm also not a particular fan of most card games.  So imagine my surprise when I discovered what a great little game this is, which is particularly pleasing since Settlers has always been one of my wife's favourite games.  In a nutshell, it is a very clever implementation of Settlers in a small, portable, 2-player, card game format.  The other cool thing is that there are several different "scenarios" that can be played.  We've only tried the basic game so far and it felt just a little limiting in terms of the buildings that can be built, but it has us intrigued enough that we're looking forward to trying the others.  I can imagine that the game will be at its most interesting when all of the scenario cards are mixed together.  But for now, we're enjoying it, and I'm pleasantly surprised!  Even the card artwork is quite good.  Personal enjoyment: 3/5  Game design: 4/5  Total: 7/10

Good, but not great. We felt the endgame is quite anti-climatic, it just...ends...ok you/I won. 

The way your province expands is satisfying although you need a decent sized table for the space. Interaction so far is limited to taking opponents resources and/or removing their buildings (played basic + era of gold so far).

It's quite long game time prevents it from coming out more often on weeknights after work.

While the game play is not complex, it has a reasonably fiddly set of rules, with a 28 page rule book (small pages) that require refreshing often. Crying out for a decent playing aid.

I really like this game. She thinks its a big "meh."

UPDATE: After some more plays, I like this one less. It never grabbed me. Sure its fun, but I never feel inspired to play it and its not inspiring to play. When its over, even after victory, I feel a big: "Okay." 

The mechanics are interesting, there is a decent amount of interaction, the spirit of Catan is there, and the components are nice with good artwork. If you really must be able to play Catan with 2 players, this will do the trick. 

Moves down from 7 to 5.

Got this after selling off the other Catan card game for it’s ability to create strife and disharmony at the marital gaming table.  Only played once but so far so good as an improvement on balance of gameplay. I don’t know what it is, but I felt there was way too much screwage going on with the last version.

I like this game, but I don't love it.  I'm tempted to get the expansion, but I'm not sure I'd ever get around to playing it.  My biggest gripe is that one player can get an early lead due to some events or action cards which is too difficult for the other player to overcome.

I also was sort of hoping that the buildings would give you more "powers" as in Agricola or Puerto Rico, but they mostly just improve your innate reaction to die rolls and event card draws;  not many buildings give you an active ability.  All you're trying to do is make sure that you're playing cards so that in the long run the random events help you more than your opponent.

Acquired December 2010. Four plays. A good game but isn't quite the game we want. Game play a little long - running about 60 minutes and I would prefer 45 min. That was with 1st Era of Gold expansion.

Haven't put my finger on it yet. It is like a strategy game in your hand and choice of actions, but dictated by a lot of luck in the dice rolling. Also, seems very tense when we play as we are struggling to get those last 1 or 2 points, but there is a lot of luck in it. I would prefer steamrolling to the end or a strategic ending.

Rachel says she misses the main interaction of Settlers in the trading.

Good theme, like San Juan of city building, with additional personality through the "heroes."

Simple building card game for 2 and it felt a little like original Settlers of Catan game but from my point of view this one is much better. Relatively easy to explain and fast to play it's a great introductory game for beginner gamers who are looking for something that looks good, players can build in the game and there is not much direct confrontation. Thanks to included packs you can adjust the game to be focused more on different parts of the game which is always nice.

I mainly play with a total of 2 players so I've never played Settlers. But this game is pretty fun for 2 players, though it can feel like it goes on too long sometimes. Bad card draws and bad dice rolls can result in several turns where you just can't really perform any actions. Planning to try with some variants to reduce bad dice rolls and card draws, which should improve the game substantially.

Update 06/10/2012: The variants did improve the game substantially, but I realized that the game still moves slowly and takes a lot longer than it should. And honestly there are just much better two player games out there. I probably won't be playing this again.

Neat little card game for two. I like that the game comes with thematic eras to change up the game play. That was a very smart integration for adding replayability. In my first game, it was very close. I have a feeling it will always end up being pretty close. The system is designed to keep it from running away.

Another interesting thing is that there is actually some engine-building and planning involved each turn. I'm glad I have it and look forward to venturing further into the different eras.

I think I might have been a little tired when I learned this game, as I wasn't getting it at first. I'm pretty sure I didn't play the game very well the first few turns and made some obvious mistakes.

The game is similar to Catan thematically, but is a different sort of beast. There's much more of an emphasis on tableau building and comboing cards. It still has the "roll the die to produce" kind of luck, but that seems to be less prominent here. I did feel the presence of luck though when we never rolled an even number for the first half of the game, and we never rolled the harp when I had the lead in skill. I think altogether there might be a tad much luck in this game for me.

This is a race to 12 points game, and I don't really love the "first to do x" game mechanism. It also seemed a bit long for what it was. But I suspect that if I had been a little less tired it would have gone over better.

I love how many different ways you can build your county. Introductury game takes just 30 min and it is great to learn the basics. Thematic game is the standard way to play, every theme set encourage a different flavour and different strategies. Once you know well every set, 'Duel of Princess' mode is the way to play, where half of every set is used, so many different strategies are possible. At the moment we have tried introductory, first and second theme sets and liking is increasing every time.

First impression, just the base game: I like it better than Catan, since it does away with the informal trading. Expecting the expansions to make it better, but even the base game makes a "let's-play-again" two-player game. Quite a bit of luck of the draw, but it's pleasant enough and well-paced. Nice.

A second session was less successful; seemed pretty luck-driven. We need more time with it, and we need to add the expansions to it.

Okay. But if playing a 2-player game I'd probably want one with a shorter playing time than 90 minutes.

RATING: 9
Fun and briskly paced. Brilliantly revamps the older game for constant action and shorter playing time.   Played only basic game so far. Rating will probably go up.

I wish the cards were thicker, because they're warping already.  I can understand the cheaper pricing to promote the game, but I would be happy to pay a higher price for thicker cards and a bigger box (and a better storage component).  Mayfair, don't miss the boat on this one - this is a great game!

I very like it. it is the great card game (number two for me). You can design time for playing.

If you want to play in short time, you can play with basic mode. If you want to play longer with more dimension, you can play duel mode.

Moreover, you can enjoy with theme mode for enjoying with trading, wars or create innovation.

If you want to play a game like the Settlers of Catan, but with only 2 players then this is great choice. It's just similar enough to feel like Settlers although it's totally a new game. Definitely one of my wifes favorite games (she beats me at it all the time). It has a lot of strategy, a lot of luck and usually enough suspense to be not sure whose going to win until the end. A few reasons why I didn't rank it higher though. It takes up an insane amount of table space (entire coffee table and it's just a two player game). It takes a really long time to play unless you are purposely trying to play quickly. Also setting up and putting away takes a bit of time. Overall though, a solid game.

This is the best 2-player game I've played so far. Many games work well with 2 players, but this is meant for it. And let me tell you, it shows. At first I thought if you simply found the right cards first then you'd pretty much always win. But it seems not so as the right strategy can bring you back on top.
That being said. Prepare to get so angry you'll swear you'll put these damn goofy square cards right into the paper shredder. Finally putting up a building crucial to your plan and having it burned down the next turn is painful. Ect.

A mix between strategy and tactics, depending on the cards you draw. Goes on too long for my liking, especially the first 20 minutes or so of the game where you slowly accumulate resources and start to expand your settlements.

Es un buen juego que para mi sólo tiene el problema del azar de los dados que hace que haya partidas desigualadas en las que uno de los dos jugadores acaba desesperado por culpa de las tiradas. Además a veces se hace excesivamente largo aunque se puede limitar en número de puntos de victoria necesarios para ganar.

The best Catan-Game!
+more thematic then the normal (i like to settle on an island, here i can not just build cities, there are special building inside)
+you always earn ressources (not like the in the nornam Board-Game)
+better balance than the original card-game
+/- not so long like the original card-game and not so much possibilites (in one round)
+/- of course everthing depends on luck, which Cards you get and what you roll!
- not so much possibilites like the original one overall.

I enjoy playing it, an really good two-player-Game!

RATING: 6
This is a strictly two player card duel placed in the Settlers of Catan setting. It is much more complex than Struggle for Catan, the other card game which is a pretty straight forward conversion of Settlers of Catan into card game form. 

Although Rivals is a card game, there is a spatial aspect to it that makes the game feel more like a tile laying variant than your typical card tableau builder. The most interesting thing about it is that there are a number of different decks (and even more can be acquired through the expansion) that allow for different scenarios to be played out in order to change-up the game play from session to session.

It's a little long, maybe even a little slow...but all in all it's a pretty satisfying game once you and your opponent learn how to navigate the different decks.

Es bueno, parece engorroso pero luego en mesa se ve que es sencillo, aunque eso si, ocupa una monstruosidad, no he visto juego para dos que ocupe tanto, no apto para mesitas o sitios reducidos.

Resulta divertido y siempre tienes algo que hacer y un plan, y las diferentes barajas le dan variedad. Muy aconsejable.

Settlers of Catan was my gateway game and so it has a special place in my heart. Unfortunately, it rarely gets to the table as our children are two,young and you need to have 3 to play. 

I picked this up used for the nostalgic hope that my wife and I might be able to play it on a rainy evening when the kiddos are asleep.

Catan card game for two players that fixes some of the problems of the original. Notably, it is easier to get resources which nearly eliminates the "mana hosed" runaway loser. Similar to Catan but you expand your province on individual tableaus.  The era cards of gold, progress, and turmoil make this jump. Cool buy option to select target card from deck. Clever way to track resources by rotating cards. Need plenty of table space for this to sprawl.

At first I thought this game was awesome, but the more I play this game, the less I like it.  The player interaction is limited to who has the luckier draws and gets the appropriate cards at the right time.  There is limited strategy involved in this game and it does not come close to measuring up with the other Catan games.

Great 2-player version of Catan.  We've only played the base game so far, and I'll rate the game an 8 based on that.  The rating may increase after playing the 3 included expansions.  The game is easy to learn, and has enough strategy to remain interesting after several plays.  The expansions should keep it from becoming stale, but even as it is, there is enough randomness in the card draws to make each game somewhat different.

Love games with not much setup time. This game is awesome. Very smart way to manage resources. Great city building game. There is player interaction with action cards which I love. 
The game comes with nice theme decks all of which are different and change the game. You can even combine the themes for variety of play.
The two expansions are awesome adding more variety to the game. Three theme decks each, for the total of 9 theme decks. Combine the themes as well to give you awesome replay-ability.
I like this game as it is deep enough without all the setup time, and small components like tokens etc. I don't have the time for games that take too long to setup and too long to play, as it is hard to get a boardgame group together.
This is awesome two player game, a glass of wine, and an enjoyable evening with my wife.
Must have!

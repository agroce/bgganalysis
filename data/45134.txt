RATING: 5
Quite simple game mechanics, nice artwork and theme. Good for a quick game if you're sick of your other card games, but it can get repetitive after a couple of times, too.

The German version seems to have the icons for political and military power switched, which is a little annoying.

2011-11-12 Initial thoughts: Arcana feels like a mix of deck-building and CCG, but there isn't too much of the synergy aspect.  A lot of player interaction and dickery in this one, which makes for a very appealing game in my book.

The base game is excellent.  I'm interested to see how the included FFG expansions impact it.  Our second game used the "B" cards from each faction, and we both included the "Hideout", which allows you to look at another player's hand.  Having that card in play impacted the game quite a bit, as well as the stronger, more focused "B" cards.

RATING: 6
Enjoyed my only game of this. Limited in scope I think and fantasy theme may not be for some, but pretty good game. The bidding element works well. Three of us were new to the game and rules didn't sink in until near the end of the session (many mistakes made throughout), which suggests that the rules are less than intuitive.

RATING: 4
One of those games that tries to be one of the cool kids and ends up being rather silly in the attempt. The comparisons to Dominion are overstated: it has a minimal deck building concept (you keep the cards you win), but nothing at all that you can leverage for combinations or strategies. The game has some serious run-away leader flaws (you gain high value cards which enable you to gain more high value cards), clunky and dull mechanics (you're just playing to get the highest number, but you have to reach all over the table to do it), unfortunate and wretched translation of rules (sword is politics and a secpter for military??) and in general, nothing redeemable beyond the artwork on the cards (which is fantastic). Avoid it.

RATING: 6
A four-player deck building game, where you have to bid for different characters, locations and artifacts (all of them cards of course) to get them. Whoever gets the most points from cards wins. The downside is that there are only a few actions cards, so basically each round is the same without any flavour or twist. You just simply have to outbluff your opponent. Also it is best only with four player.

RATING: 5
My first 'deck building' game of sort.... with a mixture of battleline in it.

Artwork is fantastic and give a very good feel of the world this is played in.

Rule book is so simple that it seem to lack some necessary explanation. Especially on the bribe issue.

Overall, a 'heavy card' game that requires some thoughts before committing on some zones.

RATING: 8.3
Initial rating. I had always wanted to play a game that felt like something out of the deranged landscape imagination of China Mieville and here we have one. I like it very much. Amazing artwork, engaging gameplay. My only disappointments: the Fiefdom indicators are way too small and hard to read, and the game would become vastly more "readable" with the inclusion of five placards on which to place each card stack. (The game is busy enough as-is, and having to always work to distinguish player bids from stacks is a needless headache.) Highly enjoyable overall. I want to try it with two players next time.

Deck builder with the cards that may be acquired up for competition each round, via turn based bidding that is sometimes hidden.
I continue to miss the aspect of which cards are useful for bidding on what type of card, I'm not sure why.
Should be relatively easy to play for most people that have played modern games, so far the issue of card types is an issue for me alone in the games I'm aware of.

A kártyák megszerzése a Blod bowl: Team manager-The Card Game-re emlékeztetett nagyon erőteljesen. Annál kicsit egysíkúbb. A pakliéptíésben pedig Dominoion. Mindig 5 kártyáért küzdünk egyszerre (melyek értéke 1,3 vagy 5 pont), a végén az nyer, akinek több pontja van a paklijában. Minden kártyán 4 féle érték van, ebből mindig csak 1-et használunk. A hozzánk közeli piacon titkosan rakhatjuk le a kártyáinkat. Egyszerű, mégis szórakoztató... De csak egy darabig! A játék túl hosszú. Ha 20-30 perces lenne, sokkal jobbnak éreztem volna (kb. 2 ponttal). De a másfél órát sokallom, annyira nem jó azért! Ami még gond, hogy nyelvfüggő, mi egy német paklival játszottunk... Nagy erénye, hogy olcsó (volt), 900 Ft-ot simán megér, hátrányai ellenére is!

Variants: Location variant, bribing Guild Leaders variant, bribing enemy agents variant, and variant where unopposed Agents automatically win a location.

Fun, quick game.  There's elements of bluffing which separates it from Blood Bowl, but less special abilities.  Another thing that separates it from Blood Bowl is that with 4 players it will probably take 33% or 50% less time to play!

I just play with 10 Stakes cards in each District, as soon as one is empty, the game is over after that hand.

Despite the deck-building design, Arcana felt like a traditional card game when playing (bid/buy additional cards). While the artwork is great, the graphic design is terrible: cards are hard to tell apart, important information is barely distinguishable, text is too small. I would appreciate it more if it only lasted 20-30 minutes.

A not unpleasant mix of blind and open bidding with card recycling that is Dominion-esque with a lot less faffing which makes for a decent game but a combination of inadequate rules and odd graphic design which fails to highlight the key game elements made it overstay its welcome. Repeat plays with rules clarifications may cut the play time to a more acceptable length.

A kind of clever little game, sabatoged somewhat by poor rules and really bad communication design - icons are indistinct, key information is hard to see, card powers are in tiny type, card categories are barely distinguishable ... terrible, really.

The game ran longer than I would of liked. There's some great ideas in this as a deck builder. I would of liked to see more card draw and discard to get cards in a players hands. I didn't feel like I had much choice in where to play, and there were times where I would simply discard as my action. The game felt slow with little excitement, there are many other deck-builders better than this.

I love Arcana! It isn't the deepest or richest game ever, but combines competitive bidding with lovely artwork and mild deck building. Unlike normal deck builders, it doesn't take long to set up either. While the theme isn't integral to the game play, it does add flavor. It feels rich, magical and combative without adding components or unnecessary complexity.

Neat artwork, neat concepts, but in its base form the game founders somewhat on the shoals of "I can do nothing useful" plays: some turns, your available cards vary between "poor" and "literally useless". Sometimes you can eke out tiny victories like 'set up a tiny bit for next turn' or 'bluff another player into paying more', but that only mitigates the annoyance so much. The fun of the game is in competing over stakes, and when (e.g.) two of your four cards are low- or no-utility, your options for "how do I compete" become drastically limited, and much less interesting. The Militia rules promise to help somewhat, we'll see how much.

(There are also many sources of randomness and minor imbalance, but hey, it's a light filler game.)

A progressive bidding card game, where the cards that are won are added to a deck and later used to bid on other cards.   So, it's kind of like a lovechild of Taj Mahal and Dominion.   The graphic design is kind of a disaster:  the icons are all too similar and too small.  Also, target values become resource values after a card is won, and that can be confusing.  Type is far too small to read from any distance.  The graphics are nice, and weird, but really it's a 4-suit bidding game that would be a lot like a Knizia game if only pared down a little.   Its long and moves at a slow pace, which really is my only major complaint, but there's some good ideas here.   Plenty of interaction, chaos, and screwage too.  I don't mind that too much, but some people will.

I enjoyed this trick-taking, deck building game.

The design of the cards is well done--very clean--at a glance you know how the cards are used, and the graphics are outstanding.

The game delivers a lot for the money.  Many variations with accompanying cards. I have played only the basic game, but am looking forward to playing the variations which should take care of some of the empty spots in the basic game. The basic game I feel is just an introduction into a meatier game.  

The many guilds and variations add extensive variety to the play.

Auctions and deck building coming together could be interesting, but the ability to add or not add any given card to one's deck is probably the most interesting decision to be made here.
Setting cards onto auctions to try to thin your own deck of worse cards might be interesting, however, even if players had really bad cards in their decks it would hardly matter. Even in 2-player players mostly end up making bank-runs on cards rather than there being any sort of positioning.

Additionally, the inclusion of some dozen variants leaves players with little confidence as to how the game [i]should[/i] be played. For goodness sake, The variants vary as much as changing the end-game trigger! What's the best game? Am I supposed to use one, or multiple of the variants? Why am I supposed to figure this out as a player?

An average card game of a kind that doesn't attract me nor convinces me to play again. There are some good ideas (way of resolving of the cards strenght is something I haven't seen before) and the gameplay flows fine. I just don't feel like playing it again - that's all.

A sort of deck building, hidden bidding auction game where you are trying to win poole cards by placing your Agents representing the notorious characters of Cadwallen to recruit other agents, obtain relics with which to bribe, and aquire control over Locations for game changing advantages. All the cards you acquire have VPs as well which are the basis of determining the winner of the game. Bidding is over 4 rounds each turn with some cards able to be played face down while others must be played face up adding another dynamic to the game. At the end of the turn the player who has bid the highest and at least the minimum required (the reserve?) wins the card and places it in his discard pile to be recycled into his deck over subsequent turns. The game comes with a lot of cards adding some degree of replayability. A negative is that the Locations are unimaginative and add little interest to the game play so not all that game changing. Art and card quality is very good.

RATING: 4
Jury is definitely out.  Basically a trick taking game with deck building elements. The art and production on the game is top notch, but the rulebook is shit. The game is probably a little longer than it should be (that can be fixed by us knowing what we're doing and taking some cards out of the decks) but it's so tactical, with only 4 cards in your hand... I dunno. I won both games by paying 0 attention to the types of cards I was winning and adding to my deck (strategy) and focusing only on maximizing the use of the 4 cards in my hand (tactics) on the 5 tricks I could have taken each round.  I think the game really discourages competition for tricks---your best bet is to grab multiple tricks in a single turn by avoiding conflict with other players. Since there are 5 contests on the table at a time (one more than the number of players at the table), this is completely possible.

Anyway.  The strategy, rather than tactics, may open up for me and add more to the game with more plays.  But I wonder if there really isn't enough time to worry too much about the strategy of the deckbuilding and the limited 4 card tactics can't carry the game by itself...  well, it certainly *looks* good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.25
The gameplay appears to be quite innovative, but that's basically all there is to it.

You bid (some players blindly others not, depending on the relative position of the bid-on item) on 5 "neighborhoods" (=deck of cards), with cards presenting different suits. The card on top of each stack determines which suit you're playing on and is the prize you bid on.

When you win a card, it becomes part of your deck, which you constantly shuffle, thus combining resource bidding with deck building.

The gameplay is nice and not too long, but the theme is scarce. Yes, there is a Cadwallon-themed story but you never feel it (despite the art being quite good).

RATING: 5
Average deck-building game whose only novelty is bidding for the cards you buy. That is not a bad idea, but with a hand of only four cards, and each purchase requiring one of three different "currencies" (the so-called arcana), your choices are very limited. Sometimes you have a strong card in one arcanum, but it is wasted because there is no card in the stakes that can be bought with it. The optional militia rules (discard a card to use a random militia) should be in the basic game, because often you have one or more completely useless cards. And then there are special power cards with annoying effects, such as exchanging places of two stakes or removing the last card played by an opponent. Also, the game suffers from bad graphic design, which causes confusion, as the applicability of some icons depends on whether the card is on a stakes pile or in your hand.

RATING: 7
Very neat; I've enjoyed my games of Arcana. There's a non-trivial luck element, both in terms of whether your needed stakes show up (a fair proportion of the cards never get acquired) and in terms of what hands you draw (oh, look, another hand of 2 locations and 2 relics). That said, it's relatively quick, pretty, and fun.

RATING: 8
The rules changes, additions, and clarifications are overwhelmingly positive. The one change I do not like is allowing any card, not just relic, to bribe a militia--but that is an easy backfix. The original version was great but a little clumsy; while this edition is not as perfectly smooth as it could be, it is a great improvement.

RATING: 6
Played the 1st version (4 players) only.

The idea behind the game is really cool and it works, but it lacks a few things, as most cards are way too similar. There's too much luck for my taste, but that's just a minor thing compared to other things and it could be much better with less players.

So, we have similar cards and some of them arn't balanced very well, which is a very bad combination. Add a few really stupid and purely luck-based rules to it and there you go...

Could be a 7 to 8 easily if tweaked at the right spots.

The objective cards are totally random.  It is often impossible to complete your objectives because the required cards will not enter play during the game.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (May 2016)

Before reading the rules, I only knew the game had tons of cards. After reading the rules I saw that Arcana is (somewhat) a deck building game, but it isn’t as good as I had hoped.

The rules are easy to learn and teach. You can do it under 18 minutes. Playtime is high for such a simple game. 

The game art is very nice (and the best feature of the game). The fantasy theme is good, but you don’t feel it through the game. 

The decisions are rather obvious, most of the time you have a 4 card hand so deciding where to play your cards isn’t hard at all. Some of the cards are much more powerful than others (this effect is very visible with some locations cards), that is, I’m not sure the game is well balanced.

I have only played with the basic cards, but I see little reason to play it again. The gameplay is interesting at first, but then the game becomes repetitive and very long for what the game offers. It begins to drag.

The luck factor is high and mitigate it isn’t easy. 

Bottom line, Arcana is an average to bad game. I will sell my copy ASAP. I would play again if requested, but my desire to play it again is low.

Deck building game in which you bid for cards so that you can use them to get other cards. It's a different approach than most deck builders -- but it relies more on luck than strategy, and the Cadwallon theme is much easier to handle in Guilds Of Cadwallon.

PLUS: different rules for a deck builder
MINUS: rules-laden, luck heavy

First off, I would definitely recommend the revised edition. The rules are infinitely better, there are two new guilds, a few other new variants are included to change up the game, and the card art - while great in the previous edition - is just amazing. The gameplay is very fun; lots of direct conflict, bluffing, strategy, surprises (with the new events) and customization (with all of the variants and the optional guild cards). A new favorite.

This is a great game which borrows the Deck Building mechanic of DOMINION but with players using Persona/Item Cards to gain "Stakes" (Persona/Item/Location Cards) from Stake Decks located at certain points on the gameing table--to the right & left of the players & the community deck in the center of the table.  Gaining the "stakes" helps the player build their deck in order to score VPs.  Players can also use Item Cards to "Bribe" Persona Cards into their Deck.  In addition to bribing, there is an element of bluffing which enhances the game that sets itself apart from DOMINION.  Each player represents a Guild in a fantasy world which is heavy on the Steampunk-theme.  The art on the cards is gorgeous in their renderings of the various characters & artifacts occupying the world in which they are set.  After one play, I'm ready to play it again--I really like this game.

A very unique deck builder because of deep, strategic player interaction where you try to outwit your opponents. It is clever, easy to learn and the revised edition adds a ton of replayability. It's a shame the BGG scores don't reflect just the revised version of Arcana because more people would have been more open-minded about it and it would have been a hit. It's out of print so find a copy quick while you still can!

It's a fun game every now and then where you try to outbid others, or at least pretending to do so, since cards are placed face down. 
But bluffing doesn't always work that well, since it's better to use your agents to try to win smaller cards instead of just using them all up on one bigger card, most of the time. 
In the German version the texts on the places are not that easy to read, especially in dim light. I would wish that the readability was a bit higher, since most text are quite long.

The decks probably won't be as functional and comboing in Arcana as they're in Dominion, but this is still a good game with really good looks.

LIKES:

* deckbuilding of a sort where you win auctions to later use those winnings in future auctions.  
* Bribery is an interesting dynamic/mechanic in the game that allows one to win some people before the turn is over.
* There is the possibility to build your own starting deck if you move to the advanced game which allows more focus in building your initial hand.  
* Five auctions sites leads to some difficult decisions as to what to pursue.  Spread yourself to thin among the different auctions and you win nothing.
* Auctions occur in 3-4 different "suits".

DISLIKE:

* The games does feel like it drags at times.  
* There is an element of blind bidding to some degree which works in the context of this game, but could be frustrating.
* This isn't a deckbuilding game per se in that you will likely shuffle your deck only 4-6 times in the game.

I don't even know where to start with this bundle of game greatness. The artwork is probably the best I have ever seen in a game. The gameplay is simple, but has enough depth that it will keep you coming back for more. The decision making is interesting, and has enough variance to make every game different.

FFG has kicked one of my all time favorite games up a notch, and moved it's rating from a 9 to a 10. First off the artwork is simply stunning. Secondly they have fixed a number of small problematic cards from the original set (like the Headquarters). Thirdly, they have made each individual Guild more unique by giving them all unique characters in their starting decks. Fourthly, they have added some kick ass new optional rules that I just love. Fifthly, they have made the game just all around more playable and unqiue. And Sixthly, they have added two new Guilds into the game. Huzzah for FFG! Huzzah for Arcana!

RATING: 7
Solid-to-interesting mechanics in this game, reminiscent of Dominion but more structured and less forgiving, which to my mind constitutes a modest improvement. Very little theme, though, and a chaotically jumbled rulebook. The really standout aspect of the game is the card art - wonderfully freaky & variegated characters, and some really lovely little architectural sketches of the locations in the "city" that you're supposed to be fighting to control.

Good solid game, but not the easiest to get to the table for some reason.  Nice artwork (illustrations) but some very poor graphic design decisions make it difficult to play with adding your own components (at least for we, the colorblind).

Purchased early on - only 2 player gaming was occurring regularly.  Theme appealed, but did not play well with 2.

Would be willing to play again with a larger group.  No chance of future re-acquisition.

Steve Nash of Board to Death Reviews suggests this game as a better alternative to Thunderstone.

Involves deck building. 
Portable. Much more so than Dominion.
Plays quickly.
Can be played with as few as 2 and as much as 4.
Also seems to be a nice 2 player game. 
Interesting player interaction (for a multi-player deck building game).
Has a trick-taking card game feel (which is a positive in this regard).

See Board to Death review for how to play and to get an idea of how fun this seems: http://boardgamegeek.com/video/285/arcana/board-to-death-review

This is a nice deckbuilding game with stakes and bribery. The core game is a bit boring because of doing the same two actions. However, game variants make it a bit more rich.

RATING: 7
A good game that is nevertheless a bit of a disappointment, because I feel that it might have been a great one. Apart from the gorgeous illustrations, the basic mechanics are great and provide a lot of interaction with a bit of planning.

It does feel underdeveloped, however, in that there are too many situations where you can lose a whole round just due to the luck of the draw, and there is no way to plan around this kind of bad luck. This would not be much of an issue if our game had been even close to the advertised 60 minutes play time, but in a two-hour game, lack of control is quite a drawback.

I'm looking forward to see whether FFG can lay these grievances to rest with the new edition - they are heads and shoulders above most publishers regarding game development, so I'm reasonably hopeful.

RATING: 4
Our first play really turned me off on this one. The rulebook is terribly written; the cards, while pretty, are a graphic design nightmare created by people who favored "Ooh, pretty!" over "Can I see what the fuck it is from across the table?"; dead and semi-dead turns are not uncommon; and maybe worst of all, unlike Dominion, there doesn't seem to be much variation in what you're going to do from game to game.

On the flipside, it integrates its theme well (for example: you often contest stakes with your immediate neighbors because you can do it face-down, and I'd imagine rival factions would spend more time butting heads with their closest neighbors in real life), there are some clever mechanics -- like bribery -- under the hood, and I WANT to like it.

Maybe a second playthrough with the militia and objectives would change my opinion of Arcana, but the fact that it has to compete with ~200 games I already like means it goes on the "sell" pile.

A great deck building game based around a bidding mechanic that has a strong element of bluffing.

RATING: 2
What's the point of having random secret objectives when half of them are impossible to achieve each game? Of course, you won't know this until the game ends. And if you're going to allow bribing of personalities, make sure they're easy to tell apart from the relics. Finally, throw in a deck-building mechanic that includes a card that is completely useless when you don't have a discard pile (i.e. the only time you ever draw the card) and you have an hour of complete blah.

Juego de construcción de mazos con una estética y una temática (basada en Cadwallion) bastante atractivas para los amantes de la fantasía más gamberra. 

En este caso la mecánica se basa en "subastas", donde los agentes de tu gremio han de atraer a sus filas a personalidades para mejorar su influencia, obtener reliquias con las que tentarles, y obtener lugares estratégicos con los que inclinar la balanza en su favor en numerosas situaciones. 

El juego viene en una caja algo desproporcionada para variar, sobrando la mitad. No es para las expansiones, no hay. Sin embargo contiene el juego básico y variaciones que añadirán emoción y mecánicas algo distintas como eventos, jefes de gremio, posibilidad de no incluir ciertas cartas en el mazo pero contabilizar sus puntos...

Nivel de puteo: generalmente habrá piques. Conseguir las mejores cartas puede provocar sangre y momentos de tensión entre los mejores amigos. Ten a mano una tila o prepara el puñal porque se trata de hacerse con el control de la ciudad y entre los gremios no hay amigos.

I need to give this another try.  It had some cool concepts but felt like it was missing something. The stakes idea is neat but it seems to be missing the element of putting together a cohesive engine that I really like in deck building games. Also I would really like it if you could get rid of starting cards and make your deck more focused.
 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An interesting take on blending area-majority with deckbuilding. There are 5 cards (areas) being fought over each turn and each of these will require being competed for in a particular sphere. You draw 4 cards from your deck (they'll have different values in the 3 spheres), see which of the 5 competitions you've got a chance at winning, and play cards against them one at a time in turn order (face-down in the 2 closest to you, face-up in the others). After everyone's played their cards out, reveal, if you've met the card's min bid requirement and beat all other players, you get to add that card to your discard pile and eventually come into your deck. So the game is a matter of deciding not only what *can* you win, but also what cards do you want that will add well to your deck and not be a dud when you draw it in future. Interesting. Cards come in three types - people (your main bidding cards), relics (when added to a person, allows you to immediately claim a card if you've met the min bid, therefore not having to wait for end of round for resolution; powerful) and locations (which provide no bid power but give a special power, like searching your deck). There's all sorts of variants you can play, with heroes, deck selection, events, etc. There's luck inherent in what cards you get to play each turn, so it's on the light end of the scale, and it probably goes a bit longer than it deserves, but there's enough here to want to explore a bit further.

Still; it's a little bit too chaotic and all-over-the-place to reach it's potential.

Nice game, blind and open bidding, 1 card at a time, which works for me. The cards you win by bidding on them, get added to your deck, where they are vp's as well as better cards to bid with next time, so some element of deck building.

I wrote a (rather poor, both as in the quality of the writing and my opinion of the game) [geekurl=/thread/476810/arcana-bad-game-or-unsuited-moffett-game-table]review[/geekurl] for Arcana a number of years back where I more or less tore into it. I traded this away many years ago and I hardly remember how it works. But as I am revising my notes for my [i]entire collection[/i], past and present, it must be said that I have zero fond memories of this game. What I [i]do[/i] remember is being very frustrated with it, and my gaming group getting very angry at it and each other. These are not emotions I want games to evoke and thus, unlike many other trades, I do not regret unloading this one.

Honestly, I blame most of the bad blood on very, very poorly written (or translated? This did come out of France after all so maybe it was just the translation) rulebook. Regardless, I emphatically [i]do not[/i] recommend Arcana.

(20) There are a lot of little quirks and it took several plays to ensure we were playing correctly.  At the end of the day the game just wasn't very interesting.  The twist of some cards being hidden and some cards being visible just didn't really add much in the way of intrigue to the game and it doesn't seem like you get cards fast enough to enjoy the deck building aspect of the game.  Playing it just felt tedious.

Arcana is bland, unbalanced game that masks an almost complete reliance on random elements and lack of public information with a combat-like bidding system.

Pros: the Bribe Mechanic, the art is pretty, the game is easy to learn  and the 3.5.5 card types have straight forward functions.

Cons: an underlying randomness leads to unbalanced situations, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, lack of information limits strategy, the incentive structure forces players to chase card suits instead of function-based / strategic deck building, which devalues the specifics of each card, deck cycling is too slow and the player's relationship with individual cards is non-existent.

Great art, lovely world-building, but nothing earth-shattering in the game itself.  Bid to win characters who join your guild in a quest to control more of the city than your opponents. Enjoyable, though it often feels too short for the deck-building game it is.  We don't use the objectives, as they seem too prone to the luck of the draw. (*update- tried them to be sure, and weren't blown away.  Probably won't use them again)  But we do really like the militia, and the ability to put some purchased cards aside, under your little home card, rather than in your deck.

not sure 2pl is ideal - less competition for stakes than in 3/4 pl

nice system - not sure how much subtlety there is in in deck 
building (lot of cards are quite samey) but feels like there may be some

art is gorgeous but numbers are hard to read across the table

i wonder if there should be another end game condition ie any 2 decks exhausted but more plays will decide

i look forward to playing again

NOTE - i feel a lot of people will rate this down for being a 'poor dominion clone' which is a pity cos it's nothing like dominion - completely different game so play it for what it is not what it's not...

Mildly diverting variation on the deckbuilding theme in which players use their cards to bid on new cards, which then go into their deck to be drawn later to build on further cards. 

As that description indicates, it's sort of repetitive; there's no feeling of generating a unique engine pushing you towards victory. The special effects on the location cards are all rather tame, while the personality and relics cards are just different numbers of points in various categories with nothing to distinguish them thematically other than a pretty picture.

I find most of the "attack this base / tug of war" type of games to be a bit meh and this one wasn't any better.  The art was interesting and it tried to do a few new things, but ultimately I feel like there were plenty of times that the game just played itself after the first few moves.

Arcana is a card driven struggle to gain influence in the city of Cadwallon for your guild.  Players pit their agents against the other player's agents in an effort to convince new personalities to join your guild, or acquire new artifacts, or gain the control of a region of the city.  The game employs some card drafting mechanics to accomplish this end; players play cards next to a Stake and at the end of the round the values of the cards are compared and the player meeting or exceeding the required value of the Stake adds that card to his deck.  Each Stake card is also worth victory points at the end of the game.

Each turn players only draw 4 cards, and there can be as many as 5 stakes available per turn, so each turn you must carefully decide what you want and what you think you can win.  The game is setup such that each player has the opportunity to play their agents face down for 2 of the stakes, and the rest of the stakes they must play face up, with only one stake in the game where all players play face up.  This leads to a delicious bit of tension for one player will know who is winning a stake but the other(s) will not.  Players may also bribe personalities by playing an artifact, thereby immediately winning over the personality, adding even more tension.  Some location cards the players will win allow them to directly interact with other players, such as having them discard an agent, re-locate an agent, or immediately resolve the conflict for a Stake.

Wow. I was surprised by this one. It's a deck building game ala [b]Dominion[/b] but with higher interaction as players vie for the cards in the commutative decks through trick-taking bids. It also has a dash of bluffing for added enjoyment. More chaotic than [b]Dominion[/b] but more fun as well. The critical part of my brain says it's not as "good" as its inspiration, but I must admit I probably would choose [b]Arcana[/b] over the other every time as I always get more enjoyment out of it.

Own the AEG first edition. The FFG revised edition is a marked improvement.

RATING: 8
Many people seem to dismiss this game and I am not exactly sure why... My guess is that many of the ratings/comments are the first edition which had its share of problems. 

However, the revised version improved the game and making it a solid deck builder I would actually choose over [b]Dominion[/b] (I know, blasphemy!)

Essentially, the game takes [b]Dominion[/b] and adds a bidding mechanism where you "bid" for cards to add to your deck which makes the game more interactive.

I would recommend giving the revised version a shot.

Card, Deck-building. Rating after one play. So far, I don't care for it a whole lot. I like how it adds more direct competition for the cards you are trying to add to your deck, but it felt like there was a lot more fiddliness and general slower gameplay for not much more reward over the "basic" Dominion experience.

Also, as a deck-building game, it felt weak because we only shuffled our decks two or three times the whole game, so it felt like what we bought wasn't all that significant. In fact, the game only lasts about 12 rounds IIRC, so your deck doesn't even grow that much. Not much bang for your buck in terms of fun and time.

That said, I'm willing to give it another try, possibly with the advanced rules / objective cards, to see if we just weren't "getting it" the first time.

Azt a betyármindenit! Egy sima Dominion lopás a játék egy licitmechanizmussal megbolondítva. A játékosok tárgyakat, személyiségeket és helyszíneket tudnak szerezni a játékban. Nem megvétellel, hanem licitálással. Minden kártyának 3 tulajdonsága van, amikben különböző képen erősek és egy tulajdonságuk ezek közül az, amit számbelileg megadva lehet őket megszerezni. A személyiségek estén akár egy tárgy beadásával megvesztegetni és így megszerezni. Aki a kör végén többet ad egy adott kártyáért vagy egy kör alatt megvesztegeti az viszi. Ezzel nő a pakli. A kártyák különböző pontot érnek, a játék végén akinek több van nyer. Ennyi az egész játék. Sima koppintás, hosszú, unalmas játékmenet, amit talán csak a helyszínlapok dobnak fel kicsit. Nem teljesen értem miért alkották ezt meg így, nagyon nem jött be.

The first deck-building game I actually like and quite a lot as well. Unlike in Dominion, in this game every card you draw from your main deck is useful (unless you forgot to put some less then useful location card under your guild card to keep it out of your deck, which is also a good mechanic). The influence battles are thrilling and the bluffing aspect adds suspense.

I've played this twice. The artwork is great. The rest ... pretty weak.
It just felt like it's trying very hard to be 'Smash Up' combined with deckbuilding. But it's lacking all the combo fun of 'Smash Up' and the deckbuilding comes down to putting everything into your deck (cause everything has points) except the really bad cards. Also the guilds' differences are absolutely marginal.

I don't recommend this game.

A unique take on deck building.  You do not just buy the cards you want in your deck, you win them through an auction mechanic.  If you see a powerful "take that" style card come out, you can more often than not do something about who gets it.  Deck randomization for the cards being auctioned can be an issue.

A light deck-building game with bluffing elements and gorgeous artwork from the Cadwallon RPG. Unfortunately, it's a bit half-baked.

Fighting over cards to add to your deck is a nice twist, but there's no scope for engine-building so it's all rather dull. The bluffing is limited, so the only really fun thing you can do is use location cards to screw your opponents.

Unplayable with 2 players. OK with 3 or 4.

Deck building card game where the premise is to strengthen your starting guild by adding new characters, items and locations. These in turn make it easier to obtain future cards, which further strengthen your guild and provide you with victory points. It's a beautifully produced game and the artwork is excellent, with each of the cards being visually impressive and there's a large selection of these. The problem I find with this game is that it doesn't require a great deal of thought when making your decisions on which cards to play. This wouldn't necessarily be a problem in a game that didn't take so long to play, but due to it's length it begins to feel quite repetitive after a while.

The game has good artwork (if you like the style), and it is a nice idea that you have to fight for your cards rather than just buying them like in other deck-building games (which this one essentially is).

Arcana is a deckbuilder that layers some iffy concepts into the basic Dominion recipe. I dislike the action cards, because they are almost universally jackass bad-blood maneuvers - but you're playing inoptimally if you don't use them, so thus the game pushes table politics and card harassment. Hey designer, you didn't finish your game design.

I would probably rate this higher if it wasn't so similar to Blood Bowl: Team Manager, which is far superior.  The only reason I would take this out over Blood Bowl is if I had a group of people who didn't like the implied violence.  Still, not a bad game and certainly under-appreciated.

An overly decent card game that could be compared to Dominion or Thunderstone--but both of those comparisons are quite a stretch.  Arcana is much more streamlined (read:  shallower) than either of those titles, but contains small elements of deck building.  

I enjoy it, and would recommend it to fans of both of those games, with the caveat that it is entirely different, and it almost has a filler type feel to it.  Lots of bluffing, stealing, etc.  Good things.

I like it after a couple of plays. Planning to try it again soon with some of the extra rules and cards, which I expect will make it an even better game. The art on the cards is incredible.

Update: We decided to use the militia, the guild masters, the optional guild cards, objectives, and the optional rule that you can tuck cards in order to keep your deck lean. These make for a great game and they get rid of the base game problem of not having enough options. 

Update: We decided that the objectives don't seem to add much to the game for us, so we stopped using those for our past couple of games. It seems like we usually go for the card we need the most at the time, or the one that gives the most points. So the objectives are just bonus points if you end up completing them incidentally.

Sold.

A Dominion knock-off, although there are no separate stacks of identical cards to choose from during purchase. Players compete for a few cards to add to their decks with the cards in their hand.

RATING: 6
Interesting card game with beautiful artwork that can be played as a medium filler (about one hour with three players). There is some bluffing and bidding involved, but some strategy is also required to make the most of the turn order and the composition of your discard pile (which is later reshuffled to form your draw pile). There really is quite a lot to consider: Your hidden victory conditions, which cards have been taken en which ones have left play, the composition of your discard pile, etc. And yet there is enough randomness to ensure replayability and a relaxed atmosphere. It is a pity that the manual is not sufficient for a complete understanding of the game, but luckily there is a useful FAQ here on BGG. Good fun with some depth.
UPDATE: Sometimes the game runs a bit too long, overstaying its welcome. This mainly has to do with the composition of the center stake pile. Lowered my rating with 0.5 to reflect the highly unpredictable playing time. Also, there are a lot of take that actions in this game - combined with the randomness, this makes for a pretty chaotic game. The new options in the FFG version are a mixed blessing: Militia and mission cards are good, event cards and special powers make the game even more chaotic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A really nifty bidding/deck-builder before there were deck-builders. I'm a fan of the tactical nature of the game and really appreciate all the variants that the revised edition includes. Works very well with 2. 

Update: The shine is starting to come off, even with most of the modular additions the game remains mostly the same (even with the Event cards limiting the game to 12 turns at most, the pace and arc of the game still play out the same). While there certainly is no shortage of card variety, that said variety doesn't have a lot of impact on the game as a whole is a marked strike against it. Downgrading rating for now.

Further Update: Sold off in quest for more shelf space, I was sad to see it go.

An interesting take on the deck-building genre. The limited amount of options increase the interaction which is often found lacking in other games of this genre.

I need more plays to comment properly, but they made a big mistake on some icon and color choices. 

The icons of cups and coins should be silver as to not confuse the main arcana when glanced at...because the main arcana is always gold...just dumb the cups and coins are also gold.

This may be better played with 5 or 6 cards in a hand per round as the deck you build does not cycle fast enough. Also 5 or 6 would give you more chance of pairing up bribes with people and give way to tension of not wanting to lose a stake to an opponents bribe.

I will try and see, in anycase this game is going to need a bunch of house rules to make it fun.  It has lots of potential and the art is very good, but it lacks fun factor because 4 cards just doesn't provide enough options.
Another problem is that the game may drag for some who are prone to AP as you have to look at 5 areas on the board and decide where best to place your cards, often with various combos of cards at various places which ends up being a lot of computations.

Traded, it was not my thing.

Set in the mythical city of Cadwallon. Arcana pits you against up to three other opponents in a high stake power struggle for your guild.
\13\ \13\
Each player represents one of the great guilds of Cadwallon: the guild of Blades, the guild of Ferrymen, the guild of Thieves, and the guild of Usurers. Based on the number of players in the game you have a certain number of 'Stakes' areas. Players battle for control of cards that come up in each stakes area each turn. A major key of the game is that the stakes areas closest to your guild allow you to play your cards face down, allowing for surprise and bluffing.

it lacks "soul", i never felt involved during the game, the fact that you use the same suits of the traditional old card game briscola is a complete turn off. Where is the "guild"?, what are cups and sticks?
and last... it is yet another deck building game with just some twist.

Not a bad game, just a game that is tasteless

[COLOR=#0000FF][b]Commentaires Personnel:[/b][/COLOR] Ce jeu est correct. J'ai juste une désagréable sensation que je ne joue pas celui-ci selon les règles. Mais d'un autre coté, je me dis qu'il faut qu'il sorte sur la table ou qu'il sorte de la maison!

A nice concept for a game, but rather predicatable and sometimes slow.
With a more dynamic approach it can become a really good game, but at the moment it's average at best.

Fun little card game with a poor English rules translation. The newer edition fixes this and adds more wonderful artwork and better graphic design to the cards.

I really enjoy Arcana. Playing with 3-4 players is a must; playing 2 player games is sluggish and not much fun. The tug-of-war created when multiple players attempt to snag a card is neat but not as thrilling with only two people.

Certainly a great filler game if you want a bit of light deck building and bluffing.

To me, this is a combination of Dominion and Great Wall of China, but is a little more complex than it needed to be.

This game has a lot of flaws for a third edition that have been revised two times - It's a pity because there are a lot of good ideas in the design.

A great game with a very wide audience, simple yet tactical
Some of the optional rules greatly enhance gameplay (Militia and Tactical Discard in particular mitigate luck and provide additional strategic choices)

Another deck-builder.  My first play left me feeling kind of dry, and I have a ton of rules questions.  If my second play (assuming there is one) answers questions and moves faster, my rating will go up; if the rules really are as squishy as they felt, it's gonna plummet.

Nice underrated tactical card game. Up until now is one of the few deckbuilding games I feel really benefits from real-life table play.

The artwork in this game is jaw-dropping, vibrant, and really draws you in. The gameplay itself leaves a lot to desired. The bribing mechanics are clunky, the game overstays its welcome, and there's simply not enough variety to keep me engaged.

A deck-builder that stands apart.  Bluffing, theme, great art, modular additions; what's not to enjoy?

First impressions is that game just has too much luck and not enough ways to mitigate it.  Wizards feel superior to knights in all except may be two player.  Whats worse is a bad hand can effectively leave you with no plays to make.  I'm not a fan.

There's too much luck involved in this game for me, the action cards are underpowered, and the card market doesn't work well for large groups. I don't suggest it.

RATING: 2
Honestly, this must be one of the worst games I have played for a long time. There is almost zero decisions to be made. You are just dealt five cards and then you play them one at a time, if you can. That is, IF YOU CAN. 

You really need to get the cards in the exactly right order for being able to play them in the first place. Once you have your cards, there really is no room for cunning.

A good analogy would be that you are dealt five cards with a number printed on each one of them. Then your task is to figure out whether you have number one in tour hand. If yes, you play that one. If not, your turn ends immediately. In the following rounds, your task is to find number two, three, four, and so on. Should you not have the next card that fits the straight, you must stop.

The only reason I am rating this a two instead of a one, is that climbing the resource tree is satisfying, if you happen to have the right cards.

Tight, elegant economic/production game in a mildly fantastical kingdom (there are wizards and potions, at any rate). Very simple setup, but plenty of strategic bang for the buck, usually you're paying twice as much for a Euro of equal meat. Nice cards and components, which is good because you'll be trading a lot of those dainty yellow resource gems. Very impressive.

As a 2-player game...
 Pros:
+ simple rules and quite demanding gameplay
+ good for beginners
+ as a filler: good for experienced players
+ a game about efficiency and “combomaking” ;-)
+ interesting graphic design
+ good price
+ it is language independent

Cons:
- tends to be too random
- special cards are too powerful in a 2-player game
- some players will not like the negative interaction in this game

RATING: 6
A bit of an odd one this, very much in filler territory but rather longer than a light game might be, with a bit more strategy and planning, yet with chaos and randomness thrown in. I am not sure the game quite knows what it wants to be.

However, it certainly merits further plays, not least because you really need to know how the cards fit together before you start and it takes a round or two to get to that point. As a result our first game was a bit of a non-starter for me because a crap hand at the start (which I could have trashed if I had known how bad it was) put me a round behind, quite a penalty on a 4 round game.

2nd play, not uprated. Very much depends on the luck of the draw which is a bad fit for what, in all other respects, is a 45 minute gamers game.

Played at Essen 2014. I really wanted to like this game. The components were nice, and the theme was fine. I like the gameplay in theory, it's different from other things I have, and I was looking for some lighter games for my group. I enjoyed the first round, but I was quickly turned off in the second when I had a perfect combination of cards to get all the way from the bottom of the board up to the top in one round, but Jason stole one of my cards (because of an action card he got), preventing me from being able to play the rest of the round (I'd taken one turn so far, and there are only four rounds in the game). Not cool, man. 

If you advertise the game as a chain-building game, you shouldn't allow someone to break another player's chain, leaving her with nothing to do but sit and watch her opponents play the game without her for the next five minutes. I'd have been better off getting a bunch of cards to fill up the bottom row of the board and then try to get cards for the second level the next time, etc. This way, I'd at least have something to do if my chain gets broken. Unfortunately, because of the randomness (you can't even keep your cards from one round to the next; you start with an entirely new set of five cards, and all the public cards are replaced, as well), you can't make long-term plans. 

A good idea, very quick gameplay with no noticeable downtime between players, but just too random and broken because action cards can prevent someone from being able to do anything for an entire round.

2014. 2-6p. 45 min. Light resource conversion game (perhaps a long filler game).

Others say: Too much luck and not enough ways to mitigate it. Not good for low player counts (2-3p) because you won't have many chances to exchange your hand cards with public cards to improve your hand (especially when your opponent(s) get dealt a better/luckier hand of card). Few meaningful decisions.

cbazler says: (rating 5). Meh. Boring, repetitive gameplay with just enough "take that" thrown in to make it annoying.

Other BGGers (with rating 4) say: (Skywalker12) This card game claims that you build a chain of production, but it is simply drawing and playing cards, not creating an engine to produce goods. Eurogamers will not like that it is almost entirely luck-based with little skill involved. (kilgore) Trying to chain your cards to optimise resource production is quite fun, but unfortunately the game is way too random for any proper planning. Supply chain management game. (Goodsound) Too luck dependent and the thieve cards ruin the game for me.

BGGer cymric says: Card randomness really, really hits home in a nasty way. 5 cards at random, 1 free exchange from a row of 6 open cards, and then 2 coins/exhange... Randomness is fickle and it showed! I got nothing but basic goods which do not yield interesting amounts of cash; my partner got a strong conversion chain on the first turn in addition to a card which gave her 2 gold per played card. On her second turn she built a Knight, creating a delta-VP of 12 between herself and me. With a lousy hand in my third turn (of four!) I decided to call off the game there and then. Of course the game is quick enough for a restart, and yes, over the course of many games there will undoubtedly be skill in working out the best conversion chains given the random inputs. But I have a distinct feeling that the balance between the length of the game and the amount of randomness in the cards is off. Considerably so, in fact. It probably gets worse as the number of players goes up, as there will be more exchanges with the open market, turning that into a random mess too. And no, a single full redraw is just another stab in the dark.

A light tableau builder/resource management game.  Others in my group don't like to play this very often, but I refuse to get rid of my copy because I happen to like it.  The market auction is what makes the game and is where the bulk of the strategy lies, but also card play order is extremely important.

The "luck of the draw" can have a pretty harsh impact, but careful planning and manipulation of the market can save you the heartache of bad draws.

This was a genuine disappointment when my partner and I sat behind the wheel and commenced playing. The goods conversion scheme is nice and simple, and the idea of using a single resource (plastic gemstones) to indicate money or some good depending on their location keeps matters straightforward ergonomically too. Kudos to whoever thought that up.

But while playing... That card randomness really, really hits home in a nasty way. 5 cards at random, 1 free exchange from a row of 6 open cards, and then 2 coins/exhange... Randomness is fickle and it showed! I got nothing but basic goods which do not yield interesting amounts of cash; my partner got a strong conversion chain on the first turn in addition to a card which gave her 2 gold per played card. On her second turn she built a Knight, creating a delta-VP of 12 between herself and me. With a lousy hand in my third turn (of four!) I decided to call off the game there and then. Of course the game is quick enough for a restart, and yes, over the course of many games there will undoubtedly be skill in working out the best conversion chains given the random inputs. But I have a distinct feeling that the balance between the length of the game and the amount of randomness in the cards is off. Considerably so, in fact. It probably gets worse as the number of players goes up, as there will be more exchanges with the open market, turning [i]that[/i] into a random mess too. And no, a single full redraw is just another stab in the dark. 

In my opinion the game needs more careful consideration on how to deal with lopsided outcomes, and give players back some control over the entire thing. Really, in this day and age there is practically a toolbox full of useful techniques; and to see none of them applied here speaks volumes. Sadly I'm going to avoid this little title; perhaps when a clever bloke comes up with a proper houserule to bring the card draw back into balance that I might take another look at it.

This is either a 5 or a 6.  It is interesting enough but has a big "take that" element.  You definitely don't want to be out in the lead when the knight gets created.  It's an arbitrary -5 VP to usually the leader.  Get hit by more than one of these and you are gonna lose.  There's also actions that let you steal resources and cards from other players.  These can hose you up pretty good.  I liked games like this in the 1980s and 1990s, but prefer less "take that".
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Simultaneous play keeps game moving along nicely and limited number of rounds keeps play time reasonable.  May be a bit too much luck for some tastes.  Game can be "stolen" by a trailing player who gets a good hand of cards on the last round.  In that respect it reminded me of Ticket to Ride where a lucky player can take the game by pulling tickets at the end of the game for routes already completed.

CLUB COPY. Awful! Luck-of-the-draw, forced interaction. Eww.

RATING: 4
Artificium is currently very cheap in the UK and is popping up regularly as clubs and meets. It is a fairly straightforward game of converting resources to better and better ones until you turn them into big points. The problem is that the cards you hold (which determine the resources you get and the conversions you can do) are randomly dealt and it is very difficult to mitigate the problems which arise with poor cards. And if you get dealt the cards you need to do the conversions you want to do then you are home and dry.

There seem to be a lot of games coming out recently that rely on very simple mechanisms to play (especially in the micro ones), and this is a good thing. No reason to not get right to the action without needless downtime. The components here work, though perhaps a bit wonky with the huge scoreboard and multi-purpose gem bits.

Good that it only plays 4 rounds, as any more and the more serious gamer might be annoyed at investing too much time in scoring based on having the right card to do so.

RATING: 3
The ostensible fun here is chaining your cards and using a free sell/buy phase to get goods that you can use with the cards you have. All in all, it's fairly reasonable in putting the pieces of your turn together like a puzzle to produce VPs and keep you flush with cash. Nothing earth shattering but reasonable for a resource-chaining euro in the "meaty filler" category.

But then the game goes off the rails with some take-that cards and general randomness that feel way too harsh relative to the fragility of the rest of the experience. You have to work so hard to pull together an effective chain but someone can steal the resource or the card that you desperately need to make your whole turn pay off. Or just not get dealt helpful cards. You can have a turn pretty much wiped out. I suspect not many euro players will enjoy that level of interference here.

Engine building on a small scale. It's kind of over before it gets into full swing, and it's very luck dependant. In our first game, some linking cards just never appeared in the entire game, so higher resources could only be bought (which is very expensive). I won with 26 points and quite a margin. The scale goes up to 75 and I can easily imagine that being reachable with the right card combinations. 
All in all, it's not great, but it passed the "stay in the collection for the time being" test.

Card-driven resource conversion system with minimal(but cleverly combined) components (your main working board is a resource conversion flowchart coupled with a number of multipurpose yellow crystals - that's it!). All that is put in motion by a card drafting mechanism with simultaneous action selection(inluding a few, but devastating production chain breakers). Simple to learn & quick to play. If you'd like to discover how a piece of wood turns into a wizard, or maybe the perfect recipe to brew your own knight, Artificium will show you "how it's made"!

Good production value of game components.  There are a few interesting things going on here, but overall the game is unexciting.  A significant factor of players' success will be determined by drawing a useful set of cards that will enable you to build or rev up your engine.  I drew a bunch of powerful, expensive cards that were no use at the start of the game AND I chose 5th from cards to grab from the communal card offering.  By the time my turn came around, I was saddled with little to do and bored while watching the other players get their nascent economy brewing and scoring points as well.  So with the great randomness/luck factor of the cards and the lack of deep, substantive or stimulating game play, I am going to recommend passing on this game.  I believe that new games have a progressively tough burden to satisfy: they must be as good or better than existing games.  There is nearly nothing here to feel excited about.

First game of this was positive, but only for 3 out of the 4 players.

I really like the style of this game; resource upgrading and production is a favourite of mine so I think I was always going to look upon this game favourably.  I think the problem with it is that there aren't enough ways to mitigate a bad hand of cards, and indeed it's possible to have nothing to do in a round (or, at least, very little to do).  That said, the game is short, attractive and compelling - and I like it.

Pretty good filler, attempts to capture the euro building nature of longer games and shove it into the shortest experience possible.

RATING: 5
The basic mechanism of trying to build card chains to produce initial resources or buy them to convert them into more valuable resources is not innovative but ok. A minor weakness is the dominance of luck in the card draw that only in parts can be mitigated by a limited possibility to exchange cards while at the same time being heavily in favor of the players earlier in turn order. The major weakness are the take-that cards included in the mix. A fine game for players who deem it fun to freely steal a resource from another player that in the extreme would have added more than 10% to this player’s final score and in turn increases the stealing player’s score by these 10% effectively leading to a 20% score difference. For me, such elements are a major turn-off and often a sign of unexperienced authors.

This is a rather straightforward conversion tree euro with nothing extremely bad but nothing to recommend it for either. I liked that even though it was all about producing two kind of basic goods and then almost auto-playing the correct cards to combine them for something more valuable, everything could be sold or bought as well – except from the top two “products”, the knight and the wizard (of which the latter felt stronger). I was not bored during game, it just didn’t move anything in me.

This is by no means a great game, but unless I didn't see some huge imbalance in my single play of it I don't understand why it it is rated so lowly here. Yes it is soulless, but the conversion of resources into other resources at least are done in a fast enough pace that the game doesn't feel sloggy. Yes there is take that, but it isn't too much. Yes it is strange the game gives you more stuff if you get further in the lead, but it doesn't cause too much runaway leader. The thing I do like about the game is the logistical puzzle of making sure you don't waste actions.

A fun resource management/conversion game that is best with many players. It's a bit flat in terms of game balance which is boring, but the gameplay itself is fun.

Seichtes "Tech Tree" Spielchen, in dem man mit Karten Ressourcen verbessert, um am Ende die meisten Siegpunkte zu haben. Macht durchaus Spaß und spielt sich auch mit der vollen Spielerzahl flott!

Pretty pedestrian game. Sometimes you have a hand that works excellently, othertimes you have to make the best of what you have. With 4 rounds, it's important to understand and have a plan of what you want to do.

Average game, but not necessarily something I would want to play too often as with 4 players it takes ~1 hour for what feels like a 30m game.

RATING: 5.5
A surprisingly compact but diverse resource conversion game, possibly an influence on the later Oh My Goods. The luck and victimisation elements aren't exactly an endorsement, nor is the wishy-washy theme, but it plays swiftly with up to four. Pushing it to 5-6P is somewhat inadvisable.

This game is a sleek resource management game.  You simply need to be the most efficient with your card selection and card play.  You get only 4 rounds to get down to business.  Plays fast, so it allows you to play it multiple times (or at least twice!) in one sitting.  This game does one thing, it does it very well, and it doesn't overstay its welcome.  Fun!

Fun game.  The symbols take a little getting used to, but once you do, the game is quite simple to get going.  It's a good kind of simple.  Plus, its use of flow-charts is a cool way to make flow-charts hip and cool.  ..oh no, I've lost the interest of the 13-17 year old crowd.  Not too thinky, sometimes it can feel a little up to luck, but it's enjoyable nonetheless.

I had only 1 play of this game, but it was enough to see a flow in this game: round 1. I didn't get any basic resources and there weren't any cards in the market. No problem, I just buy grain for 2 gold with the 5 starting gold I had and convert it into food. I plan to upgrade the food, but hey, someone plays an action card and as they come first, they steel my food and my card is wasted. No problem, I use an other 2 gold to buy wood and convert that into bear. I want to upgrade the bear, but hey guess what, someone played an other action card by whom he could steal my bear before I could convert it. So after round 1 I had no resources and 1 gold. STUPID game!!

Produção agradável, num jogo rápido, que ainda poderia ser bem melhor se não tivesse ataques diretos entre jogadores, pois o mecanismo central do jogo, ao estilo "upgrade" é muito engraçado e fluído (o mapa de evolução podia ser mais explicito, mas enfim). Gosto da arte e do insert da caixa, claramente produzido para o efeito; contudo, há uma coisa muito estranha neste jogo: para se poder roubar tem de se pagar moedas ao banco!!!

This game is everything I expected and searched for. I wanted a game in my collection that:
1. Is relatively short and fast to play, so the new players won't become bored;
2. Is flexible in a sense of players count, i.e. can be normally played from 2 to more than 5 players, suitable for duel and big company. Artificium is perfectly good for 2, 4 and 6 players;
3. Is easy enough for new players, but has some deeper level underneath to be not too simple for experienced players, so neither becomes bored;
4. Is not just cards game and has some other elements to use;
5. Has good quality of said elements (Artificium has PERFECT quality);
6. Has game mechanics that suits me. Economy, resource production and conversion suits me very well, I could say it's "MY" theme;
7. Last but not least, I searched for a game that was created and developed in Russia for my collection.

Artificium has ALL that. It is a lot fun, fast, has meaningful mechanics and has almost no flaws. 10/10

RATING: 7.5
28-05-2015. Rated after 1 play. Bought on a whim after a lot of Dice Tower hype. It seems like the game is flying largely under the radar. But I think it's good.

Basically, there are 4 rounds in which you get a hand of 5 cards, a resource board and a couple of gems. You can then either dump your hand and draw 5 new cards, or trade cards with an offer of 6 cards. You basically programm your actions, to increase the value of resources and play increasingly better cards that gives you more money, cards and most important VPs.

Good game. I like it. I am a bit muffed by the annoyance of several of the cards. As you programm, it can get messy if someone interacts with your programming with the AP and thinkiness of getting most of your actions. Artwork is great, game is good. I like it actually.

Könnyed kis átvezető kártyás játék, amiben két különböző nyersanyagból újakat tudunk kártyák segítségével készíteni, majd mágust és lovagot gyártani, amivel plusz kártyákat tudunk szerezni, illetve ellenfeleinket visszaütni. Minden átalakító kártya győzelmi ponttal jár, az interakciósok viszont nem, cserében elég erősek. Aranyos kis játék nagyon nagy szerencsefaktorral. Igazából megérdemelné az 5 pontot is, de a lovag királycsináló tulajdonsága miatt jár a mínusz pont.

This card game claims that you build a chain of production, but it is simply drawing and playing cards, not creating an engine to produce goods.  Eurogamers will not like that it is almost entirely luck-based with little skill involved.  Theme is weak, but the artwork is well done.

The good thing about this mystery-buy of mine is that it plays with up to 6 players in under an hour and the fact that it does something nice with resource-upgrading. It gives you some feeling of accomplishment. The bad thing may be that it is a bit bland. There is some strategy to be done, but in the end when you get some take that-actions directed at you, you can stop playing.

looked ok picked up for a fiver. Fun tile style game need to play a few times to get in the swing.

Finally got a few more games in and its pretty good. Quick and although the thought of converting stuff to make stuff and gain points sounds dry. The speed and the fact that that's all you do makes the tactical decisions interesting and thoughtful.

Slow going, and sort of monotonous...  The components are frustrating with the yellow plastic gems being everything from coin to resources.  If you move one on your board by accident, oh well.  Using different Meeples for all the resources makes it better, but still the game runs flat, and doesn't really get interesting until the 3rd and 4th rounds, and then it's just a matter of who gets the card or steals it.

This is an unexpectedly mathy games hiding in the guise of a reasonably lightweight card management game. It has take-that cards. Most cards are of the very simple convert a to b and take x points variety. I'm only 4 games in but I've found games to be intensely tactical. playing a take-that card requires that you sacrifice some or all personal advancement. You really have to time the use of such cards when it screw others the most. Taking a lead makes you an instant target, so this helps to mitigate inevitable luck from card draws. This is clearly a very well-designed game. It's easy to teach, but it feels like there's a lot left to learn in order to play well. There is one problem I've noticed. All four games have been with new players. In each game someone has so thoroughly screwed themselves in the first round so as to lag way behind the entire game. I hope this resolves itself once all players have a game or more under their belts.

A very clever and quick-playing resource-conversion game (with a wonderful set of components for tracking all your goods, Herr Rosenberg should sit up and take note!), but unfortunately suffers from just a bit too much luck and not enough variety.

I applaud the designer for pursuing simplicity in their design, as it has resulted in a number of positive points. However, the final execution leaves a bit to be desired.

RATING: 7
First off, don't play this game with two players. It will end with one of you hating the other.

The main problem with this game is that you screw with other players without knowing what you're doing. You just take a card from them at random. It could be not a big deal, or it could destroy their entire round. And there are only four rounds in the game.

That said, I like it with more players. You can target the leader, and more cards become available to swap.

The supply chain works, but I feel like the cards I draw make the choices for me.

This game is easy to learn and teach, though.

Full disclosure: I got a review copy of this from the company.

Another fantastic game out of Russia, which makes me even more keen for Viceroy once it releases to the wild. Artificium has players swapping cards in hand with a common market in the draft phase, then using those cards to generate and convert resources while earning VP, stealing cards or resources from one another, or earning cash. Player hands are made up of five cards, so there are five turns in each of the game's four rounds, and as players climb the VP track, they're periodically rewarded with free resources or cash.

Swift, interactive, clever, easy to teach and learn and a ton of fun even at its maximum 6 player count, this is a fantastic card game for all.

Medieval production card game that starts with a draft to transform resources into finished goods for points and ultimately create wizard towers and knights for special abilities. Advantage for players that know the cards and how to set up the combos. Fast play, fairly light with a dose of player screwage.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The biggest thing for me of why I do not like it is because of all the work to get the right five cards in your hand to have some one randomly take a vital card away.  And the biggest part of the "biggest thing" for me is the person that took your vital card not knowing they took that card away from you.  I am okay for games like chess that if you did not think to defend yourself so one will then take you out.  But when a person attacks you without knowing they attacked you, that sucks.

Time-line is a quick trivia game focused entirely around dates.  Players will discard cards from their hand onto the right place on the timeline until you have no cards left.  As the timeline grows longer, the game gets harder.

This is a fast-paced, good looking resource processing game. In just four rounds you want to get and transform as much resources as possible in order to score best in the end. Simple resources give you little points and they can be stolen, too, so you want to transform them asap. 
The game provides also a great sense of humour: in order to get a wizard, you need to sell some coal, a potion and a barrel of beer. How funny is that! :D

A nice and funny game when you have little time. I recommend :)

Looks more complicated than it is - just a straightforward resource management game with a little drafting. Feels fresh and moves quickly. The theme does nothing for me, but it doesn't get in the way, either.

RATING: 8.5
Marvellous production by GMT, looking forward to more 18xx titles from them.

Having spent some time with this I see why it's often recommended as a good intro 18xx. It still has teeth but they are significantly blunter than 1830's, and companies spread across the map rapidly which speeds things along a bit. 

One downside is it's not really any less complex rules-wise than 1830, what with all the abilities the private companies have. 

I have a real personal preference for the partial capitalisation in this game as it gives you a lot of freedom to open companies and interesting decisions in how to keep them well stocked over time. 

Overall it sits alongside 1830 in my estimations, very happy to play either.
edit: have played both titles more and definitely prefer 1830 now.

the midwest.  I thought the way that the private companies were handled was a little screwy, and since your private companies can largely dictate which rail you buy, it would be nice to be less luck-driven.  A very well-balanced medium-complexity 18xx game.

En mi opinio, un 18xx para iniciarse de 10, pero con una profundidad y jugabilidad al nivel de los 18xx que he probado. Las rondas de acciones, mas amables que las de otros titulos, y una duracion entorno a 3-4 horas, son tambien puntos a favor, para enganchar a otros jugadores.

18xx condensed to a 3 hour game. One play convinced me this is a must have. The best 18xx I've played. 

The rule book leaves something to be desired, especially the section about half-caps and how shares pay out (the examples don't quite fully demonstrate the difference in some things).

After two plays with three players this seems to be missing many of the sharp edges I like in the other 18xx games but it still has a good train rush and lots of timing considerations. I'm not crazy about the draft but it's serviceable. I definitely see the euro overtones since it's focused on the small tactical decisions of running a corporation. The arithmetic reminds me of calculating a turn in Power Grid, which is not a compliment. Not exactly what I'm looking for in an 18xx but it plays fast. Interesting to see the system spindled and mutilated to such a degree. Basically 18xx methadone for when I can't get the heavier stuff.

Tom Lehmann adds some interesting things to the standard 18xx mix.  A large and very diverse set of private companies is drafted at the start of the game.  Often 18xx privates are little more than income boosters, but here their special abilities should guide your later purchases of majors.  I also like that increases in share value are tied to increases in the amount of dividend paid.  Paying for every piece of track laid cuts out a lot of the late game faffing with multiple upgrades for minimal gains.

The stock market seems pretty tame, placing the accent firmly on building up your companies.  I do miss those stock market shenanigans. On the plus side, the map is pretty tight, offering lots of potential for blocking with token and tile placements.  Played twice with different​ groups.  The second play showed that a long, grinding end game can be avoided.

I own the GMT edition.  Production quality is excellent, with a mounted board, chunky track tiles and a sturdy box.  I find the artwork very appealing.

1846 is, in my opinion, an excellent introductory game to the 18XX series. Even better than 1830 in that regard. Rules are simple and quickly teachable to regular eurogame players.
That doesn't mean that it is a simplistic or uninteresting design. 1846 is a meaty economic game, with a somewhat cutthroat  (albeit not too exaggerated) feel.

The most different from the standard 1830 of the 18xx's I've played until now. 

First time with 5, the game dragged quite a bit; combined with the linear, relatively static market, this caused my least favourable first impression of the 18xx's so far. But I can see plenty of potential in the game (I quite liked the capitalization rules, and the private companies were interesting), so hopefully next time when we're more familiar with it it'll go better.

I've played this game 3 times apposed and 3 times solo. As an economic game enthusiast I thoroughly enjoy this game. There is a lot of clever game play that 'can' happen and good gameplay is rewarded while poor gameplay sinks you. There isn't much in the way of catch up mechanics so who ever plays most consistently wins. There are a lot of things you can do, ie. you can dump the presidency of a struggling company on a shareholder, you can start multiple companies and you can take the presidency of a company from a player who didn't buy enough of the shares. It is a really rewarding 4 hours even when you don't win. I've never won. You will do math in this game bring a cheat sheet.

I played 1822 recently and I enjoyed it so much that I had to rethink my rating of this game. This game is still great but the traditional train rust in 1822 makes the game much more interesting and challenging than the soft rust you get in 1846. I didn't think it would make a big difference but for me it does.

Untill now my favourite Deep Thought Games variant on 1830. The game was a real tokenwar and was one of the major decisionmakers in the game. What I also liked, is that only one system of shares is used during the whole game. The system of issueing shares to get money was a very good idea. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Although I haven't played that many 18xx games, I can see myself playing more 18xx in the future for there is a lot to like.  However, there is definitely more bookkeeping than the Age of Steam system.  18xx games also take a lot longer to play than Age of Steam.  

The main downside to 18xx is that the repetitive endgame drags on for waaay too long with fewer and fewer meaningful decisions.  Basically, presidents run the same routes, no stock is purchased/dumped, and no further Trains are introduced.  Waiting around for players to "brake the bank" is not the way I want a game to end.
    
My current rating for 1846 reflects my interest in playing any of the shorter titles in the 18xx system.  Since I have only played 3 different games (1824, 1848, & 1850) I really have no idea how good/bad these titles are compared to other 18xx games.  What I do know is that I get bored of 18xx around the 300 minute mark.  For that reason I prefer 1846 for it ends before that point.  

1824, 4 players, 7/27/08, 1 play!
1846, 4 players, 10/17/10, 1 play!
1850, 4 players, 11/12/10, 2 plays!

UPDATE: Known as a great introductory 18xx game.  Random (no bidding) opening auction which is helpful for new players as they do not have to try to evaluate how valuable a company is.  However, the ever-present question of "how much money do I need to have left over after buying private companies do I need so I can buy x number of shares of my company set at y par value" is still there.  Companies are incrementally capitalized (money goes into company treasury for each share sold versus a company getting a lump sum of money all up front).  There is a bonus from running trains from the E side of the board to the W side.  Each of the share companies have slightly different advantages and disadvantages and unique synergies with private companies and one of two local railroad companies (Big 4 or Michigan Southern).  The train rush can be very fast if players are being aggressive.  I've seen companies buy 2T's only to see them become obsolete the very next OR and then rust.  The designer of '46 is the same person who designed Race and Roll for the Galaxy.

Clearly a member of the [family=19]18xx family[/family], [i]1846[/i] is a streamlined entry by [designer=150][/designer]; the same gentleman who brought us [i][thing=28143][/thing][/i].  18xx games are played in the following sequence: a Stock Round (SR), and then a series of Operating Rounds (OR).  In the case of [i]1846[/i] there are two OR's each game round.  Play continues in this fashion until the bank runs out of money, or until all players but one have gone bankrupt.  In this game, players rarely go bankrupt.

And that actually is one of the reasons why this game is "streamlined:" it is focused more on successfully running trains rather than brutal stock market maneuverings.  This belief is supported by the way that new railroad companies are started: it only takes a player purchasing 20% of their stock to open them.  As its trains run, the dividends for any unpurchased shares remaining in the company's treasury are paid into the treasury itself.  In other words, the company makes money for itself to keep on expanding (building track, buying new trains, or buying "tokens" which you can think of as travel "hubs").

The other interesting mechanism is the way private companies are distributed at the start of the game.  You can think of private companies as "special power cards" which influence players' opening strategies, and have an effect through the early and mid games.  Most of them (save for one, the Mail Contract) are removed by the end game.

These mechanisms mesh together really well.  [i]1846[/i] focuses on what I currently feel are the fun parts of an 18xx game, without all of the dastardly options or punishing environments in other 18xx titles.  I'm really enjoying it.  With that said, an 18xx game is an acquired taste: they're not for everybody.  They're very math-heavy, and long-range planning is required.

For this reason I am docking its score a full point.  A "10" should be a perfect game all around.  The limited appeal of [i]1846[/i] means it won't be a "go to game" for every group.  But if you're curious about 18xx games and want to step up to the plate, then definitely give [i]1946[/i] a try.  Especially now that [publisher=52][/publisher] are offering it on a [url=http://www.gmtgames.com/p-554-1846-the-race-to-the-midwest-1846-1935.aspx]P500 list[/url], at a much more reasonable cost.

An enjoyable 18xx experience. I was able to play with several people new to theis genre of games without much trouble at all.

Pros: The components are very nice and the tiles are thick! The rules are clearly written and the game is friendly to newcomers (slow rust, no private auction).

Cons: I missed the more complex stock market of 1889 (2D).

Overall a beautiful production of a very good game. I very much hope that GMT continues to release 18xx games with this component quality and relatively affordable price.

Though not my favorite 18xx, it's possibly the design that I admire the most, the structural changes in it are quite deep and the game is incredibly replayable.

Played this for the first time at Grandcon 2013 with 4 players.  It took 5 hours with rules explanation.  Enjoyable game that is a little easier on the less experienced as the rusting of the trains is less brutal.  Also enjoyed not having to auction for the privates as without good knowledge on their abilities is difficult to bid on.

Overall a good starter game for a newer 18xx player.

I recently had an opportunity to play this game and I liked it a lot! The play is very different from [b]1830[/b]/[b]1856[/b] and has some devices that are novel to me (the drafting of privates, the way dividends work and the stock market mechanics). Interesting how similar the stock market mechanics are to Martin Wallace's advanced rules to Railways of England and Wales (it appears he must have borrowed heavily)

I like the different approach to trains whereby after the two trains are all sold you choose which style of train you will next purchase (either a 4 Train for $180 or a 3/5 Train for $160) The 3/5 scores any three cities out of an (up to) five city run. Similar choices are given in the next two levels as well (5 vs 4/6 and 6 vs 7/8). As the trains at each level cost different amounts but offer different revenue chances, you are faced with important decisions every time you contemplate train upgrades. Some times the company treasury will take the choice away from you.

But perhaps the thing that impressed me the most was the beautiful production job Deep Thought Games has done on this 18XX entry. All the components are laminated (including the track tiles) and the board is thickly mounted (but not hinged unfortunately - although I understand getting a hinged board is an option).

While not a "robber baron" game of stock manipulation like [b]1830[/b], it is no less cutthroat in the competition between players to manage their portfolios and rail lines to make the most money. There are more "stations" in this game and "pipping" offensively and defensively is as every bit as important in this game as it is in [b]1830[/b].

The game has quickly made my wish list!

My first taste of 18xx. I own the GMT version.

Immersive and very interactive. I like the privates draft which accelerates the game start. Decision space is exciting and uncomplicated while strategic depth is significant and revealing itself with each play.  From a graphic design standpoint, I enjoy the clean look. All information is well organized and easy to grok. My favourite gaming experience yet. I pretty much want to play it as often as possible.

Not sure what it is about this game.  There's definitely depth here, but I'm not overly enthralled with it.  So, why have I racked up 10 plays of this game faster than any other 18XX and faster than most other games I own?  I don't know.  It's quick for an 18XX (playable in 2 - 3 hours).  It's got enough variety that it doesn't feel samey even after repeated plays.  There's also a decent amount of space to explore.  Lastly, I don't think there's one strategy for victory.  Definitely a keeper.

the biggest new factor in this one - and it's interesting,

RATING: 8
Personally, I quite enjoyed this for an 18xx - lots of streamlining and cleaning up of a system that's gotten a bit messy. The partial capitalization rules, variable starting companies (with some randomly removed based on number of players), elimination of the small towns, better minor companies, and the simplified stock market are all huge wins. Like 1825, this is likely to be much more about running your company well and making smart secondary investments than it is about weird stock market traps, which is all to the good.

However, I've seen this billed as an 18xx game suitable for non-18xx gamers, and I think that sadly that's true-ish at best. There are so many 18xx patterns and tropes embedded in the game still that any experienced 18xxer is going to slaughter newbies and it's not clear that it's going to be that much fun for the newbies. As is traditional, the playtime is also lowballed for any but the most hard-core 18xxer; if you're new or a casual fan, budget 6 hours minimum. You're not going to get it done in 4-6.

I used to love 18xx, and if this had come out some time ago when I still had a few friends who were casual fans this would have been awesome. For me today, as a eurogamer who only occasionally plays 1825 and 1853, 1846 is really hard to find a niche for. I'd love to play it, but we're in a spot where casual 18xx players are rare and most gamers have moved on to euros. If you have a group that is receptive to this though, definitely check it out. It actually has the potential to be among the best existing 18xx titles.

Tom Lehmann tends to design fantastic games that take 25 hours' experience to play with any degree of competence. 1846 seems to buck the trend: after one play, I think it's a very good game that takes one 6-hour game to play reasonably well.

This is the second 'introductory' 18xx I've played that's at least as challenging as 1856 or 1860. Where are these designers getting their information? 1846 is stuffed to the brim with strange rules, exceptions, quirks, and details. In no sense is the ability to pay a half-dividend consistent with an 'intro' 18xx. The private companies are fascinating but spectacularly complex, both in their solo behavior and their interactions with one another and an owning player's decisions at the top of the game.

I've always held the opinion that the best intro 18xx has nothing to do with rules complexity or playtime and everything to do with group preferences. Does your group want a sweeping narrative arc? 1856. Does your group want a taut mathematical exercise? 1825. And so on. 1846, from this perspective, is a good intro title if your group loves Age of Steam but wants to try an 18xx.

With only two exceptions, absolutely everything works in 1846. The focus is unusual and tight: it is a portfolio management game in true 1825 tradition. Lehmann tightens things up considerably here, though: the pace of this game is absolutely breakneck, and if players do not place their bets properly and aggressively, they will get slaughtered. There is simply no margin for error in the stock rounds, none at all. Aat each stock turn, the investor at bat must ask himself which is likely to be the most high-paying company over the next two ORs, which is likely to be the most high-paying company over the long run, and if the two are different, which one to invest in right now. The player who answers these questions incorrectly the fewest times will win. Since companies can print money at will, the answers to these questions do not depend so much on foreign investors' behavior, making them fairly calculable. Each player can and should look forward all the way to the end of the game from the second stock round.

The stock rounds' focus on portfolio efficiency extends to the board play in ORs, which seems to be about running exactly one company at a time. Usually this will mean running one company for the entire game, and sometimes this will be about duping early investors with a disposable cash cow and opening up your 'real' rail next, but it's hard to imagine a successful strategy that involves running multiple companies. This is certainly strange for the 18xx, but I like the approach as something different.

Personal bias alert: I hate, hate, hate half-dividends. I don't know what they serve, except to make uninteresting busywork for players and soften up the fantastically hard decision of 'withhold' or 'pay.' Especially in this game, where companies make money hand over fist and so can almost always pay a half-dividend and still receive the maximum stock market boost, I just don't understand why players have the option.

The initial draft for the private companies is an embarrassment to the game and to the series as a whole. It has absolutely no place in an otherwise fierce and precise environment. Play it once to see for yourself, and then consider replacing it with almost any other system you want: they are all superior to this weird, inappropriate draft.

1846's stock market is a thing of wonder. Lehmann has stripped almost all of the stock manipulations out of the system, encouraged cross-investment in a far more organic fashion than 1825's brute-force approach, and allowed the market to be truly responsive in ways players can influence. This is simple stuff, like stock on the open market tanking a company's share value, but it all works perfectly. It ties with 1860 for the best 1D market I've seen, and 1860 had to add half a dimension to work!

Calling 1846's train rush a train rush isn't quite right, because the game starts at 100 miles an hour and doesn't change speed at all. Companies hit the ground running: you will scream through trains, and so no entity in this game ever knows any state but panic. With so few operating rounds, errors are much more painful. So don't make any!

A fine game, and a very unusual one. It perfectly combines 1825's eagle-eyed focus on portfolio management with the rich and expansive environment of a large 18xx game.

Great all-around 18xx game. Good for beginners, lots of goodness for experienced players too. Not having a privates auction helps quite a lot to get going, since you do not need to value the privates. The map is smart, but not awfully tight except at the highest player count. Love the two minors, not so keen on the slow rusting. The production quality is stellar, absolutely gorgeous.

A bit of a tamer 18xx, but nice overall. Very solid design.

I'm a great fan of all things 18xx.  This game was presented to me as a "shorter" game and one that could be used as a teaching game.  I suppose the latter may be true, but I'm of the opinion that 1830 itself is the best teaching option.

I really enjoy 1846, but I find a couple elements that I enjoy in other games are missing. The private distribution (draft) is not satisfying to me.  I want an auction. If I think a certain private is awesome, I want to be able to bid for it. 

Secondly, I find the stock market to get kind of dull. There is little stock move. Other than setting yourself up to do the triple increases in stock value, there is not nearly as much fun with shenanigans as most 18xx games. Its more of a 1829-family than 1830-family.

I like the rule that you must pay for each tile lay. It makes builds even more interesting. You want to be efficient, and its common to just not have enough money to lay the track you'd like to lay. 

The train rushes can happen a few different ways, but usually the trains go pretty quickly. This is softened by the obsolete trains getting one last run as they are "phased out". 

Bottom line, I enjoy it...but I find that some of the sharper teeth are missing that I enjoy in other 18xx games I've played. I'd probably request something else, but will want to play this one from time to time.

Billed a beginner's game with some legs, the first thing that strikes one with this title is the gorgeous production values, lavish in comparison to what you're accustomed to with normal 18XX titles. As for the game itself, it's mostly an operational affair with a very short playtime that magnifies the impact of player decisions each step of the way. 

Most of the companies start in the east and are incentivized to run west and create a cross-board link as those pay out large bonuses. Tiles go up fast, as they can be built 2 at a time, but they also cost money, which requires repeatedly dipping to the company treasury. This is made easier by the presence of half dividends and the ability of companies to issue stock into the pool to incrementally self-finance.

The game varies a bit by player count, as fewer players means fewer starting companies. It also varies based on where the privates end up, and those are handled in a "unique but I'm not sure I like it for the long haul" method of drafting from a hand of 7. The plus side of this is that it makes you try out combinations you might not otherwise attempt. The down side is that it constrains some of your decisions and can unfairly benefit players who draw favored options (or negatively impact players in the wrong spot who are forced to spend money on crap later).

Companies can easily run 3-4 trains very profitably in the early game and aggressive play can lead phase III and phase IV blurring together very quickly. Full looting of companies isn't something to expect, but the originals can be tapped to give the late starts some legs. The main issue the later starters face is the cost of the trains relative to how much money they can raise efficiently with the time left. It is also not effective to trash stock, as only company president sales depress the value at the time of sale (if any stocks are in the pool at the end of the SR the company devalues 1 total). When you combine the disincentive the president has to sell with the ability of companies to triple jump for high value runs (which is definitely doable on this map) it combines to make this an operational game first and foremost, and one where it seems most games are going to involve players starting 1 company and running it effectively for most of the game. I would play again, but I don't need to own it. Though it is shorter, I don't think I would want to play this more than 5 or so times tops. Likely solid for raw beginners, but I would prefer 1830 / 1889 for that depending on the player count, as I would prefer to introduce people to the stock trashing side of the family first as I find it more interesting; YMMV.

Loved getting this game to the table. The rules are forgiving enough that it's hard to go bankrupt if you're trying to run a company responsibility. The starting privates also bootstrap everyone's income making floating a company happen sooner. The GMT production is top notch and the game has a lot of depth to explore. Going to keep this one for sure.

Got a second, 7 hour play in with a table of 5 players and this game was vastly different than my previous games. I made two mistakes of setting the Penn IPO price too high and then starting a second corporation that I lost control of in the first stock round. I spent a good amount of time trying to recover but was able to the the east-west connection with Chicago built right across the center of the map with Penn. There was no chance of winning but came in 4th, not far behind 3rd after a bunch of good operating rounds.

I would still rather play an 18xx game over something like TI:4 but compared to some of the other entries in the system this has fallen a bit for me. I'm currently really enjoying the smaller map of 1889 and like the fixed game length of 18CZ & Poseidon. Most of the people I've been able to play 1846 with tend to be inexperienced. This leads to no one moving the game forward at times and what I think is a longer than expected experience. Maybe more practice for everyone will bring down the play time (and boost the rating).

Nice, quick 18xx game.  We played with 4 and were done in about 3 hrs of playing time.  It wasn't as cut-throat as some of the other incarnations and having the railroad begin operating with the presidents share was a pleasant twist.  A little more complex than 1851, another short one, but very satisfying.

This one has grown on me.  Initially I didn't care for it, and avoided it like the plague.  Later, when looking for good XXs to introduce to Euro gamers, I bought a copy of the new edition, figuring the component upgrade would lend some appeal.  Now, in my year of 100XX games, I've played this one a bunch, and I'm enjoying its subtlety (and short play time).

RATING: 9
First play at Board Games by the Bay didn't seem as tight as I had expected, with each player initially floating one company, then simple track laying and route optimisation. Nobody acquired a second company, and no grey tiles on the board at the end of the game. Come our second play a few weeks later, all charters are gobbled up in the first SR, with one quickly tanked to give that player's second charter a leg up. (November 2016)

Highlight: 2016 (November 2016)

The initial Private Distribution round and the first SR -- where players are establishing initial board position and looking to pair charters up with synergistic Privates -- is a critical part of the game. If you're last in order in the initial SR, Privates that allow you to teleport can help with limited board position. Floating a company at 4 $50 shares instead of 2 $100 shares means more revenue to the player and less to the treasury when dividends pay out. (December 2016)

RATING: 8
Having only played one game of 'Steam over Holland' and one game of 1846 I can't really make any meaningful comment about how good 1846 is compared to other 18xx games, however judged on it's own merits I enjoyed, for the most part playing it.

I liked the economic aspects of the game with the 'market' determined by what was taking place on the board. The separate company and personal finances is a great concept and the rail/route building aspect is something I always like. I would certainly play this, or indeed try another 18xx again - but not sure I will become an addict.

A couple of negative comments, and I'm guessing these apply across the 18xx family and not just specifically to 1846 :-

- It played quite long, over 4 hours and is supposed to be one of the shorter 18xx games - OK I was a noob and the other players were not experts either.

- It gets very mathy towards the end of the game when multiple, many stop routes are being calculate - spreadsheets and score pads to the ready.

- The artificial constraint of what track-layouts you can build based on the tiles available feels very 'gamey' and introduces an unnecessary AP prone consideration to that aspect of the game.

- I suspect that it needs players of similar skill levels to be a contest - new players will be taken to the cleaners by experienced players, with not much fun to be had by either set of players in the process.

I am still deciding whether I should keep my own copies of 1825(1,2,3) and 1830 (Mayfair edition) or just one of them (and then which one) or neither, given how hard 18xx's can be to get to the table,

RATING: 7
A perfectly reasonable 18XX that unfortunately discourages you from starting multiple companies. One of my favorite things about the 18XX games I have played to date is the competition to found particular second companies and how they interact with each other, so this is a little bit less interesting to me.

On the bright side, I do find the private company auction (and the private companies themselves) to be very interesting. I would definitely play it again, but I do not know if I need to own it. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A fast playing 18xx game, firmly in the "build/1825" side of things, rather than the "stock/1830" side.  Pitched as a good alternative for new players, it's anything but.  It's surprisingly fiddly with a terse set of rules, with important, related details sprinkled throughout that have to be picked out.  It also feels most of the "game" is in the first third, after which it just plays out.  Not sure about this one.  At least it's fast.

A decent 18xx title which emphasizes route building more than share holding.   There are a large number of private companies, and I liked the idea of drafting them.   Many people seem to agree that you need to run two companies in order to win, and I can see that.   The problems here (for me) are the same as with any 18xx:  it's dry and mathematical, with some tedious calculations and tons of making change with the bank.   You'll spend as much time doing that as you will playing, if not more.   As such, the system can be a bit more like work than play.

1846 is my favorite 18XX game.  It's a well-designed game that's beginner-friendly (because of the way the minor companies are distributed, for one thing) and reasonably quick.  My group can finish a 4-player game in under 2 hours and a 3-player game in an hour and a half or so.  It does take longer with beginners and/or with 5 players.  My shortest game was actually 70 minutes with 3 experienced players.

I see comments that claim you can't win if you run two railroads.  I have records of 42 games that involved 3 or 4 players, and the winner had the most shares in two railroads (including ties for most) in 22 of these games, and in three railroads in 4 other games.  Only in 5-player games does the winner usually stick to running one railroad.

RATING: 10
Probably my favorite 18xx so far - it's a weird hybrid of the 29 and 30 branches with partial capitalization , but it works well.  This, more than any other 18xx game, promotes strong companies and has really nasty track laying (that actually costs money).  The randomnes in companies makes games very different. It has a much friendlier train rush than other 18xx games, and the private distribution makes it much more newbie friendly.

NT Based on one play but, I really didn't think I was going to like this game. When you hear people talk about 18xx, it sounds so boring. I was happily surprised by how tense and interesting the game was. 
Playing time was an issue for us but, we were all very very new and I think that if I am able to get this to table more, the rating will go up and playing time will go down, significantly.

I have had several players encourage me to play the 18xx railroad games, claiming they are the best RR games ever designed.  I like RR games in general & I like economic games.  I had my first opportunity to play at Bryce-Con 2018.  The game was scheduled for 5 hours, we ran over an hour, and ended the game before it finished  (another half hour?).  We all had other games we were signed up to play.  

At the time we quit I was in second place where I think I would have stayed.  Yes, I liked the game.  However I don't think it warranted 6 hours of play, and I was told this was one of the shorter 18xx games and that many last double or triple the time.  I have played many games that last this long & longer, but I was more engrossed in those games.  Not much happened during those 6 hours--my train went from a 2 to a 7/8, and I owned stock in several companies, plus being a president in one, and laid track.  That is all that happened.  I am sure I will get snagged into some more of these games because my gaming friends are so enthused with them, but I will not be suggesting them.

The shorter (than normal 18xx) playtime and variable start-up make this a favorite of mine.  I enjoy the random setup elements as it helps prevent against scripted starts.

Great game. If it is your first 18XX game the rule explanation will take some time and it is hard to fully grasp the game. But after playing a bit the rules are simple and easy to understand. 

It is not very mean and the take that and possible takeovers does not affect me negative. 

Love making money and investing in the company or give the divident to share holders...so that I can buy shares in other companies. 

One rule that could make the game more uneven and perhaps mean is if they would not have the limitation in number of shares. I feel that this game could do without that limitation. 

There are lots of calculations and the game is not for everyone, but for those who like a meaty game with lots of economic decitions i really recommend it.

I think this is a fine edition to anyone's 18xx collection.  The scaling of private & public companies, independent companies, double track lays, scaled bank, and the prevelance of running a good company & making sound stock decisions wins you the game.  The idea of trains getting "1 more run" after the phase criteria are met is also to my liking.

A really enjoyable way to get into the 18xx games, not too nasty but with huge variety and many strategies. My favourite Lehmann game. Edit: after 4 plays, we are loving this game: so much variety, so much fun.

Played with 5 for the first time; board much tighter, maybe less opportunity for share fun? Great times though.

Addendum

Rating down to 9. Again with 5, found the opportunities to catch leader and switch companies etc less interesting.  It may be an issue with 5 player, or perhaps it is the games economic snowballing effect. Still great fun though!

After two plays, I have to put this "system" into my top-10 games. Will 1846 be the game that eventually stays here, or something else in the 18xx genre? That's to be determined, but the system here is pretty amazing. At first it felt pretty multiplayer solitare, but after you play it a bit, you realize how much you can affect your opponents by what stocks you buy and sell (and when) and how quickly you can purchase trains. In the end, you don't have to play the best to win, but you have to play competently with the company(s) you control and identify who's got a strong position early and invest alongside them to piggyback on their success. That part of the game is fascinating.

This is a good game in the 18xx tradition.  I like the incremental capitalization rules (a corporation gets more money in its treasury as players buy its shares), and the fact that you can release 100%, 50%, or 0% of income as dividends.  Also, the stock market isn't as vicious, since it's 1-dimensional, and stock only moves down if the President sells shares (and only 1 step down, no matter how many shares he sells?).

It badly needs computerization, however -- calculating the final scores after the money runs out needs a spreadsheet, it seems!

Having been introduced to many of the games levers elsewhere, I *thought* naively that I would be able to jump into this as my first 18XX. Boy was I wrong. The ways in which the multiple levers (e.g., shares/stock, track laying/geography, and train rush) interact make for one hell of an opaque and interdependent game.

My early rating is an optimistic 8 that is likely to rise if further plays: a) get shorter in length, and b) make visible and viable more forms of parasitic and disruptive play.

Really cool game, in a family of really cool games. This one in particular is nice for beginners since instead of starting with a bunch of auctions (as most 18xx games seem to) you just start with a draft and have to pay face value for whatever you grab. Auctions are a fine mechanic but they pretty heavily reward repeated play, so the draft here makes things a bit more conducive to adding a new person to an established 18xx group. In general the system is really fun and this one seems like a solid version. I felt like the trains were coming out and rusting really fast, but maybe that's just because this was the first 18xx game I ever played and I appropriately tempered my expectations for the future games. Don't get me wrong I'm not saying I don't like the rusting mechanic, in fact I think it's great, it just felt hard to manage here where in later games I was watching and preparing for it. Again, this is probably a result of this being my first game.

I changed my rating from a 9 to an 8 after about ten plays.  A very good game, but the main issue for me is that after about the 3rd round, the results are almost always obvious and there isn't much that can be done about it.

RATING: 8
It says 2-4 hours on the box, but that would not hold true for inexperienced or only moderately experienced players of the 18xx system. That said, what 1846 does really well is make the system accessible for newer players by giving strong operational decision points but few stock manipulation levers, which can be harder for newer players to appreciate. 1846 is really about investing in railroads with strong operations and operating your railroads as well as possible.

Every 18xx has slightly different rule sets that distinguish them. The unique aspects of 1846 are that the initial set of private companies are drafted rather than auctioned, basic track lays cost $$, and some of the railroads have pretty powerful special abilities based on historical activities. Some of the private companies also have powerful abilities that can be leveraged to great advantage early in the game. My primary concern with 1846 is that if a player manages to draft a complimentary set of initial privates that gives them an early income advantage, it will be challenging for the other players to overcome that. By starting with a draft rather than with auctions, players have less control to prevent this from happening. Since 1846 lacks the levers to really manipulate railroad stock value, it makes it hard for players to get creative to catch up, especially if all players are playing well. In our game, one player got both the Michigan Southern and the Steamboat Company privates and was able to leverage both via Holland for significant early income that gave him a share advantage that nobody had much chance to overcome when those advantages expired. The game is definitely fun, though, and I'll play more for sure - but I can't rate it higher until I see more about how the privates play out.

Now I understand why this is one of the most-mentioned and played 18xx. The most unique feature is the initial private draft. The other elements are known from some other 18xx variants but are combined in a novel way. 1846 has a comparably high decision/time ratio and seems to offer a strategic space large enough to allow for very different games. The incremental capitalization plus the ability of companies to issue stocks to the pool open the room for hazardous play. There are enough possibilities to mess up although as a whole the game has a feelgood vibe of revenue increase, track improvement and stock growth.  A great variation whose rating might rise further.

A few notes on company specialities we've messed up:
- IC gets additional capital to the amount of its initial share price
- CWI token has "teleport" ability when bought in, so do the B&O and PRR reserved token spots.

18xx the special power combo-builder. What I find fascinating about 1846 is how different groups of players have discovered different apparently overpowered combos. (I don't know if anyone has done a systematic review). But  it reminds me a bit of something like Glory to Rome or Innovation.

We've never managed to play this as outrageously fast as many others, but it is still some of the best gaming bang for hour that I know of.

RATING: 7
1846 is touted as a good introductory game to the 18xx game system. What you get is a fine economic simulation addressing the expansion of railroad companies from east of the Appalachian range towards the booming midwestern hubs of Chicago and St. Louis. GMT has done a great job with production and player aids. The end of the game is likely going to be a bit boring since it is all about pumping money out of the bank as the whole infrastructure is ready. I wonder whether the game would be better with fixed amount of rounds instead. It is a fine game, but my rating is really reflecting the idea of playing this in max three hours which is what it should take. Based on my experience I also can't understand why some people are so much in love with a game system that is in the end about constant optimization and counting supported by setting the progress on a map to help make it feel more concrete.

Great 18xx game set in the midwest!  So far, I think this is my favorite 18xx game next to 1830.  This one isn't terribly long and likely good to start new player with.  It also plays well with three players.

Managed to ring-fence a Saturday afternoon to play this. As very amateur 18XX players it still took 4 of us c.6hrs to complete but we enjoyed it and will play again. sure time will fall closer to 4 hrs. Final couple of rounds were bit flat as no track changes possible - usual 18XX trait I suppose.

Impressive.  Seems like a game with enough variations built into it to keep you coming back for more.

I like the "realistic" operations.  Having to pay for the track you build is a great connection to theme.  I also like how the stock market slows down predatory shenannigans.

Loved 1829 and Northern as a kid - had first editions (sadly long gone) but wanted a replacement that wasn't too long with a small board. Thanks to a recommendation by avlawn, I bought this Tom Lehman-designed, GMT-published edition. It is wonderful. Components are bright and lavish. Fantastic. A great entry-point edition. Also have 1860 Isle Of Wight and 1865 Sardinia.

RATING: 6
I am not a huge fan of 18xx games for many reasons, but I prefer much more this one to 1856 and it is much more newbie friendly. There are many reasons why:

1. No auctions for private companies. You draft and buy.
2. Trains only fade out, so you can use them one more time before they disappear.
3. 1D share track makes it easier to manage.
4. Double function trains, trains have 2 options like (4 or 3/5)

The only drawback I can see is the fact that the back does not buy the rest of the shares have the same bug than 1800 where you do not want to buy other people's share because that directly gives them money. So people seems to only buy their own company share.

Second, I liked express trains in 1800 so much, that I think they should be in all game. One of the reason is that I was always struggling to get a train for the simple reason of surviving and train becomes so expensive at the end, so they are very hard to get. I would have loved to have smaller permanent trains like express trains.

As with all 18xx, just a bit too long and fiddly, but the private companies are interesting and the game is less daunting for newbies than other titles. I still wouldn't play it with experienced 18xx-ers.

Brilliant take on the 18xx genre.  Stock market is simplified and made a bit less cutthroat but not to the point where the interactions lose their flavor.  The private companies are interesting.  Components are a cut above the usual 18xx standard.

I once thought 18XXs were not for me. Then I bought Poseidon, and it was great. Then I played 1856 on rails and I thought Poseidon on the table and "real" 18XXs by e-mail was all I needed. Then Eric Brosius convinced me 1846 would be a great idea. Then I played it once, and I already think this is [i]great[/i]. Sadly it took almost three months for the second play, but it was worth the wait: we did the complete game this time and it was a blast.

We are still quite slow, though. It took us about five hours for a 4-player game, but I'm sure things will go faster as we play it more and my poker chips arrive.

[b]May 2017:[/b] There's another reason why we took so long. I forgot to remove some trains when playing with 4 people. Let's see how it goes next time (I hope it is soon!)

[b]June 2017:[/b] After seeing the [i]Huber accelerator[/i] in a play at Brosius' place, I was amazed at how this game can be played in 2 hours with a few tweaks - namely using poker chips instead of paper money and using a spreadsheet for the operating rounds, instead of handing money to players on every dividend payment. Let's see if I can reproduce that with my group. If I can play it in 3 hours I'll be more than happy.

This 18XX game is simpler to learn and teach than most 18XX games like 1830 or 1856.  It focuses on operational aspects of the company and portfolio management and less about bankrupting other players.  It reminds me of Baltimore and Ohio, but with track building and stations like 1830.  It has more balanced private companies.  I played this and found it to be an excellent game. 

It is still pretty heavy and it is much easier to get into if you know 1830 or another 18XX game.  I would strongly recommend this as the entry into 18XX.  It is more accessible though and I would call it a medium to heavy game rather than a heavy game like 1830.

[b][thing=17405][/thing][/b] has never been one of my favourite [b][family=19][/family][/b].  It's train rush is blunted by letting obsolete trains run one more time before they're discarded.  It's stock valuation is one-dimensional and though it allows stocks to jump multiple steps, it artificially restricts them to two jumps until they reach a specific value.  It also encourages players to commit to one company and treat that company well (and invest in other players' starting companies because they'll probably end the game in a stronger position than any of the companies started later in the game).  So, all in all, it's a rather tame [b][family=19][/family][/b].  In spite of it's tameness, the more I play it, the more I appreciate the design.  There's some subtlety to this game from what tiles can be placed where; for example, certain cities are naturally restricted in upgrades based on the "geography" and not on having a specific tile for them.  Certain private companies work better with certain railroads though there are ways that even the most unlikely match up can work with a little creativity.

For me there are better 18xx games. I find that players end up focused on their own corporation to the exclusion of everything else and that the shape of the game is decided by the initial deal of minors. The components in the GMT edition are top-notch. I particularly like the chunky rail tiles.

This was a game that was high on my games to get list. Now I am glad I played it before I bought it!

The game lasted for 8 hours and even then it only ended because we called it. Wow, way too long a game. 

The game itself is very good and really not that heavy in weight. But it just took way too long to be enjoyable. If this was condensed into a 2 hour game it would be one of my favourite games, but as it is the length of the game reduces my enjoyment of it to zero. Unfortunately I will not be adding 1846 to my collection, which is a shame, as there is a great game in the box but it just takes way too long.

Very fun -- Not as obviously dastardly as 1830, but chances for screwage and a powerful train rush combined with a real focus on sensible track building. The company stock manipulation is very interesting. Buying stock in a company weakens it long-term, but strengthens you. Lots to think about. Looking forward to more play.

I simultaneously really want to play this again and really want to play a different 18xx.  For as brutal and cutthroat and mean as 18xx is hyped up to be, I found 46 to be pretty overall constructive.  Obviously I haven't even begun to scratch the surface of the game's depth, but it feels euro-familiar in a negative way - a lot of the game involves rolling your snowball down the hill as fast as possible.

Before playing 1846 I had only played a single game of 1830 at 3 players. Even then I knew that I would love most 18xx games that I played due to the high interaction.

I played 1846 with the perfect group. Everyone was new except for myself but having played only 1830 I didn't have any great advantage over them. The game took us many hours as we played it at a convention and were interrupted by meals and sleep but it was well worth the effort.

As of this writing I haven't played any other 18xx games besides 1830 but I can see why this is the perfect learning game. The sharp edges of 1830 have been softened a bit to allow new players to ease in to the experience. Everyone felt like they accomplished something in the game.

I highly recommend this game, especially if this would be your first introduction to the 18xx genre.

Currently a game that I've been teaching and playing quite a few times. I don't necessarily think it's that great of a teaching game, but with the GMT reprint in the hot little hands of would be rail barons, this is where the heat is. I started to become concerned that this would fall really flat after my third play, but I've been encouraged to dig deeper. My rating for 1846 could go up or down depending on the next game or so. At the absolute worst, I would prefer playing 1846 to the many complicated, multi-hour engine building euro games out there.

Caveat on my rating: I'm very new to 18xx, so I'm at the stage where every game I try seems fantastic. I'm sure that will change as I gain more experience.

1846 seems like a very sweet game. 1D stock market with multiple jumps, interesting companies, fun way to distribute the privates, good goals in the E-W-connections and the race to Chicago.

I was looking for a slightly shorter 18xx experience.  So far, most of our games of 1846 have averaged about five hours which is still about two hours longer than advertised on the box. Our game group just has some slow players. That said, I am very happy with 1846 and like several of the features such as one market price for stock (no par price), capitalization as shares are sold, and E-W bonus runs.  The method of drafting private companies doesn't bother me, although I can see how some people would prefer more control with an 1830-style auction.

RATING: 7
So this game and Steam Over Holland both seem to be extremely chaotic systems, at least in the opening.  You want to open at that magic number that gives you enough money to run well, but not so high that you can't buy your own shares, and not so low that everyone else decides that your shares are the hot thing.

I just played a game that I pretty much crushed; everything broke the right way for me.  It's possible that I played well, too, but it's hard to say, and I wonder whether it's possible to predict which course will be correct.

At least the game is enjoyable; it's cash-rich, and while there's sometimes sweat over "where is my next train coming from?" I have yet to see anyone get seriously wrecked by it (ignoring the first game I played, where I opened the GT at $50 to see whether it was viable ... given the outcome, I'm inclined towards "no").

[b]1846[/b] by [person=150][/person] (Race for the Galaxy)
Midwestern United States, 3-5 players

From game description:[i]
1846 is an 18xx game set in the Midwestern United States. Differences from other 18xx games include scaling the number of corporations, private companies, and bank size to the number of players, fewer restrictions on actions such as raising money and using private company powers, the initial distribution of private companies, and paying for virtually all track builds.[/i]

Supposedly a great intro to 18xx games. Described as a 18xx Euro hybrid missing many of 1830's elements. See this excellent [thread=665386]review of 1846[/thread] by Eric Brosius and also [thread=770853]Why Groups of New Players Often Struggle With 18XX [/thread].

GMT games decided in Sept 2015 to open pre-orders for its reprint. It´s an exciting development for the 18xx community which is hoping more 18xx titles will get reprinted.

Should be a short 18XX variant, but our group may be a tad slow. Anyway this is interesting and not too complicated 18XX. It is good game for newbies as the train rust is slow and the stock market is peaceful.

1846 is also a game where I took my first 18XX victory. A good reason to like the game as well. ;)

RATING: 7
First impression (4 players) : There were many small details/rules differences to 18xx base series that I liked. Those small privates with own 2 trains were kind of cute and I liked streamlined (& more random) private "auction" too. The way you can sell stock from companies in order to gain money is good and gaining extra income from East-West connection is kind of nice addition and creats some competition/blocking opportunities. Biggest problem of the game was the way network seemed to develop until very last OR and this made counting values of track painful and happened often. Especially as there were X/Y trains (visit X cities but count only Y) that made this even more complex.

RATING: 6
My first play of an 18xx game. I enjoyed it more than I expected to, and it wasn't as complicated as expected either. I don't see much difference between this and a heavier Euro game (except in this game they forgot to hire an artist). I don't enjoy repeatedly crunching fairly large numbers though, so I wouldn't want to play this too often. These games seem to appeal to people who enjoy adding up money. Boring busywork, says I.

As far as 18XX games go this one is fairly straight forward. There is little stock manipulation as the market only moves in a straight line unlike other 18XX games where it can move up and down as well. Thus you focus on investing into and building the best companies. Laying track and tokens to create routes and block others while timing your train purchases. It also plays in about 4 hours, so fairly quick for an 18XX game. We all enjoyed it and it would be a good intro to uninitiated 18XX players or those you love to build out their companies without too much stock manipulation.

I like the scalability, the random set-up mechanics, and the draft for privates and minors.  It is equally good with 3 or 4 players. I have not tried it with 5. I suspect it would be good, although there would be a nasty token war.

It ramps up fast all right.  This can have a real economic snowball if you have a workable plan to optimize the potential of your private company(s) and corporation.  There are many such opportunities.  

Its also a highly thematic game, showing the surge in growth of 19th C. midwestern USA.  

Its supposed to play quickly, as in 3 hours, but I've never found that to be true. It plays in 4-5 hours, and that is not with 18xx newbies either.

RATING: 8
A fine 18xx for new players, but it does have some downsides. I'm not a fan of the 'companies only doing well' type of games and they made quite a few changes in this to not make it a smooth transition to other 18xx if the new player is still interested.

However, and this is a big however, the variability with the drafting and randomly removing privates, the variable bank size based on player count and the short play time allows this to be played more often than something that takes 4 hours. I've been able to do some interesting and unique strategies that aren't probably as feasible in the other 18xx games.

While this is not even close to my favorite 18xx, I can appreciate and actually enjoy a lot of what this does.

Alright, finally played this edition of 1846. While I still vastly prefer the production choices of DTG, I can appreciate what GMT does for their production. The super thick tiles weren't as problematic as I thought they'd be. They really didn't slide around. Cardboard chits for the companies was fine and I'm glad they colored the backs. Thick cards for the trains, privates, shares is also fine, but having a blank side was an oversight.

Overall, I'll be continuing to buy 18xx games from GMT as long as they keep putting them out.

I had never played an 18xx before, but I have a lot of love for games that have been inspired by this genre. My playgroup did some research here and found this is supposed to be the best starting point. It took us roughly 3 hours for setup and rulebook with interruptions to put my children in bed when they came downstairs asking for post-toothbrushing snacks. The game itself took nearly 6 hours. (4 hours without rules on our second play) It was completely worth it.

it's basically, buy stocks until everyone passes, then two action rounds, and on each action rounds you can put down two tiles for a company you own the majority of, then trace your best route, and then decide where that money goes, to the company alone or to everyone who has stock in that company (including the company itself for any unbought stocks). 

Throughout the game players will invest in different companies which means that your moves can help others as much as you, or they could even take control by getting more stock than you. There's also player interaction on the board where someone could cut off your route by putting a city down.  The nuttiest thing that adds tension is that as the game goes, the old trains rust away, and getting caught running a company without a modern train is a major penalty.

I have always struggled writing a comment for this one, and I'm not sure why. I do enjoy it a lot and am unlikely to ever turn a game of it down. Play time is roughly three hours, and you can often call the game one set of ORs early; you can't always come back after you fall behind, so in many ways, the game is front-loaded and relies on how you initially decide to make your privates, minors, and majors work with one another. 

But it's clean and simple, and a lot of it is easy to grasp for new players. I've seen it work as a teaching 18xx, something I would never have guessed (many of its MacGuffins don't appear anywhere else, and I'd choose 1830, 1889, or one of the smaller 1830 clones to introduce features that are much more common in other titles). But it really is a fun, snappy change of pace. The stock market is not a weapon -- it's just for tracking purposes. That's not an indictment, just that the game is almost entirely operational. But the interactions of privates & minors & majors is fun and variable, and I do feel that this game offers pretty clear feedback throughout, unlike some other 18xx games where the connection between "Action" and "Outcome" is not always evident.

Played with five in our gaming group.  Not enjoying this title at all - due to the small play area this player count generates too much "take that" cut-throat competition from the early game on.  Have seen that a player making "the right moves" can create an unstoppable lead and the game provides no opportunity to recover from a mid-game set-back. Might be okay with four players, more likely with three.

Accelerated and more friendly 18XX due to the trains getting one extra run after rusting.  Simple initial drafting system for distributing privates, variable companies/privates available each game (when less than 5 players), and interesting privates which allow different strategies from game to game.  Not to mention the short play time which makes this game really easy to get on the table.  By far the best introductory 18XX title in my opinion.  For anyone thinking about trying out an 18XX game, play this one a few times before you try 1830, this is a much friendlier game that does not punish players for minor mistakes like 1830 does.

After 1 and 1/2 plays (first one was learning as we went along referencing rule book which was actually fun in itself) I am really digging this.  Lots of levers to pull and things to consider on how to get money into Companies you control, what track to build, what other companies to cross invest in etc.  Said to be much different than other 18xx due to the slow train rust and less stock focused, but I really enjoyed the running a good company aspect.  Can see playing this one quite a lot.   

Need to explore 89 next and then probably on to 49 and 60 to explore a bunch of the short 18xx games.

Charming game where it actually is a good idea to run your company well.  There isn't a whole lot of room for embezzlement nor various stock shenanigans. Still, there certainly is a satisfaction to be had in knowing that you did a great job running your company well -- and you are rewarded for it.  

The pace of the game can be extreme.  If the first few players take out a couple 2 trains, then before you know it you will be in Phase II. At that point, people will rush to rust the heavy two train investors before they can really use them (the phase out rather than rusting makes you naively think you are going to have it easier).  The game is like taking off of an airplane and pulling all the way back on the stick before reaching cruising altitude.  You only have a short window of opportunity to use your privates before they are empty slips of paper.

The only thing going easy on players is the silly half dividends.  Unless you really need the money most of the time you will pay out 1/2 and jump up on the track anyway -- often even two steps.  The 1/2 dividend makes me sad a little as they strip some of the interesting dilemmas from the 18xx system.
This is the game that 1861 wanted to be.  I might be curious, to see if I can just port the market system directly into 1861.

The only thing that I don't love about this is the silly privates drafting opening.  When I play this again, we will just set up the stocks by value and auction them off 1830 style (perhaps $5 cheaper).  As is the privates are just too lucky for this kind of game.

1 play, 3-player 2006

I've been wanting to learn the 18xx games for quite some time now. Mary seems to like them a great deal - we own 1856, 1870 and 1825 Unit 1 (but haven't played ANY of them!). Kevin had brought this, 18GL, 18MEX, 18this and 18that (but surprisingly not 18theotherthing). He taught us how to play.

It's a network-building, connection, stock investing game. You start out with a little cash which you use to start a company buy buying shares in it. When companies operate, they lay track and make abstracted deliveries - you just get a payoff based on the value of the cities you're connected to, assuming you have the appropriate number and type of trains to make deliveries. The payoff is split amongst all the shareholders (the company initially has most of them; as it becomes profitable, players will own more and more shares). As companies get bigger, player incomes are also improving and you can start or invest in other companies. You can also manipulate the stock value a bit, to try to devalue companies other players are invested in. 

To me this seems like a predecessor of Age of Steam; and I mean that in a bad way: AoS seems to have streamlined some of the annoying things about this game - the constant math calculations about which routes to choose and how to split dividends amongst all the stockholders, having to exchange money EVERY TURN, sitting around waiting for your turn to come up again. 1846 just seemed ... tedious. Although that may be because I made poor decisions early on: it took us 5 hours. I had made some newbie errors and was pretty much dead in the water from very early on, so I didn't accomplish much worthwhile for a large part of the game.

A 7/10 for now; should prob be a 6, but I think I'm going to like it more now that I know the rules.
-----------

2nd play, 4er, 8.5 years later (2015)

It was much better this time around! It still took us 4.5 hours, but I have learned a thing or two about the system in the 8+ years I've been flirting with it. Much of my earlier comments still hold true: I prefer the streamlining in AoS, especially the much simpler payout system. But the game is much more fun once you actually start to accomplish stuff! And clearly there is more to think about in 18xx: the small companies, the stock market manipulation, and the timing of trains rusting out -- all quite a challenge for me, generally. This game ended up being a very close one, with a final cash range of 4095-4700 (I was 2nd with 4405!).

I guess I'll have to bump my rating a bit?

First of all I need to say that the GMT production is high quality.
Only one play isn't enough to understand all its nuances and possible shenanigans but it feels like it's a simple 18xx game. It's very much keep going with your company, improve the track and run your trains. I like the way the company leveling up is somehow benefited because it runs the obsolete trains once more than the other companies. 
I wouldn't mind play it again but for now I think I prefer good old 1830.

It's a heavy economy game which until now I haven't really appreciated. 
If you think laying track is difficult try to  keep share holders happy, give out dividends and try to stay afloat whilst battling your opponents for bragging rights who has the most shares in the companies.
The board doesn't looks big and it isn't and to start with you think that is a walk in the park but the complexity of this game is just mind blowing.

Golden Spike "priority" production. By the same designer as the outstanding Race for the Galaxy. 

This is a brilliantly engaging game. As much as I love 1830, that game seems to be a bit antique when compared to 1846.

I really wish this would get picked up by one of the big boys so that it can published (with a bigger map to hold some charts and some rules clarifications/illustrated examples of play) for the masses.

Could be/should be the new face of 18xx.

Great, great 18xx game!  I realize my other "10" 18xx title is 1830.  I realize they are both vastly different games given stock market interaction, but they're both excellent in differing ways, and I think that's the hallmark of why 18xx is such a great series.  A few tweaks to the rules here and there and you have a completely different, yet nonetheless thrilling game.

If you're the type that is inclined to like 18xx, then 1889 is a much, much better entry point for the series. If you're not an 18xx type, I'm not convinced 1846 will to turn you into one.

Interesting play because I am not used to the engineering branch of 18xx-games. Also it is possibly the shortest and one of the easiest titles in the genre. The game rushes off into lightspeed from the first OR and finishes with first-time 1846 players with some 18xx experience in 3 hours. Game state develops fast and game comes to an end very quickly. Production quality is what it should be in the GMT version, would not mind them publishing more. And now to the ugly side, the very quick game-speed means that catching up is very hard and with the soft-rusting this game lacks the tool to hurt those ahead of you. In short once you lose you lost where in other games you may still be able to pull off a hail mary and rust your comperitors trains to even the playing field. Still in such a short game it might not be all bad, the worst thing is probably the lack of tension that comes from the missing train rush and this is definately a feel-good 18xx and I believe I prefer the mean 1830 branch of 18xx.

I'm skeptical of the fairness of the initial draft for privates, but it certainly makes the game unique among 18xx.

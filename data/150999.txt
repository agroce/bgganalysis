Good deckbuilder with ano interesting twist, to score your cards you have to remove them from your deck. Makes for an interesting balance of trying to have a good deck and scoring points.

All players need to understand that part of the game must be denying cards to the other players. With that in mind this is an excellent variation on typical deck building.

Although a tight deck builder system, it is mundane in overall presentation. I dislike the rule of no duplicates in your tomb (it makes the game a bit more fiddly). The manipulation of the pyramid of cards is interesting, but that is generally all this game has to offer. The graphic design is tragically boring. I certainly don't feel the need to own it and would rather not play it again.

1 play later and this game is gold.  Definitely brings new mechanics to the deckbuilding genre.  Deckbuilding + deck deconstruction.  There's so much to this game.  Calling it now, this is the star realms destroyer.

Pleasant little deck-builder.  It has a nice spatial market mechanic and some really interesting buy vs. invest decisions to make.  It seems like you really need to be stashing a card or two every turn...and watch what you purchase late in the game!  I'd be interested in trying it again, but I probably won't buy it.

Deck building game with a neat mechanic of only scoring cards you entomb - which takes them out of your deck!

RATING: 7.5
Very interesting deckbuilding approach. Your deck is not really evolving too much because you are getting rid of important cards to put it into your tomb, so you have to think when it is the best time to put that card into your tomb and disrupt your own deck. It is very creative way of a deckbuilding game, the problem is that the cards get known with a lot of plays and the replayability of this game can be compromised by that.

Mr. Cleaver is a professor emeritus of electrical engineering, and that intelligence shines through in both of his designs. VOTK is small box (+), has a small footprint (+), scales very well from 2-4 players (+), and provides lots of interesting decisions (++). The game can easily be played at a bar, in fact I almost always have a copy on me because its so portable and people almost universally enjoy it. VOTK (and the now released afterlife) are a sort of distillation of the deckbuilding genre. Because you are able to freely remove a card from your deck every turn, the decks stay small and very tight. Because you NEED to remove cards from your deck in order to score, you face a difficult decision of when to remove your useful cards to score them at the end of the game versus leaving them in your deck to drive your engine forward. The amount of time you have to do this is very different in a 2 player versus a 4 player game, yet the games stay interesting and tense in either case. Can't recommend this one enough, it's cheap and a must buy!

Afterlife is significantly better, to the point where we haven't really wanted to mix them and just play with Afterlife.  I picked this up because it was cheap, but I expect it won't be staying in the collection.

Deckbuilders are a blind spot with me; I have yet to come across one that I have really enjoyed playing.  Valley of the Kings is no different.  

On a Dominion chassis (draw five cards, use their actions or spend them, discard newly acquired cards...) it adds a pyramid of cards from which only cards at the lowest level can be drawn. In order for cards to score they must be placed to the player's tomb.  There are some interesting choices around keeping a useful card or augmenting a valuable set in the tomb.  So there is enough there to give Valley a slightly different feel and it seems competently put together with nothing glaringly overpowered.

The AEG edition's cards are well produced and the artwork gives a decent feel of ancient Egypt.

One of my favorite deck builders of all time. The system of having valuable cards that are worth a ton of points, that leave your deck when they are scored is brilliant. My only issue is that for how interesting the pyramid market mechanic is, cards do not feel difficult to get to. Great game.

RATING: 5
While this is a small but solid deck building game, I must admit it wasn't my cup of tea. The entombing mechanic was quite annoying since you want to keep the good cards but you must entomb them to get the points... To win the game it felt like I had to do exactly what I did not like, while doing what I like did not pay off at all. However, in my group I was the only one who wasn't very happy about it, so this _is_ a biased opinion.

pursue deck trimming, start entombing 1s immediately (leave at most half of them around), once getting 3s, entomb 2s and so on ... manipulate pyramid cascading to your advantage.

A good tight, little deck builder. Its just 96 ( I think) cards but it plays easy and has quite a bit of game in there. A pyramid of cards is built and you buy from that adding to a tableau in front of you. Each card taken causes the pyramid to collapse making some items cheaper. Scoring is all about "entombing" artifacts that you have collected.

RATING: 7.5
Fun and surprisingly deep game for a deck of cards.  A couple folks in my game group will actually ask for this one to play, which normally is rare for requests to come up.  Easy to learn, but there is many moving parts.  The whole concept of using the cards to help make you powerful, but knowing when to pull the trigger and start burying them, that's brilliant.  If anything can be said, I kinda feel like the ancient egypt theme is a bit played out.  I would have liked to have seen something else with a bit more flash on the cards, but it's a small gripe.  Great game, totally recommended to seek out if you haven't played it.  Note, we always played with 3+ players, not sure how it plays at lower count.

RATING: 8.3
Simple but somehow majestic little deck builder, with an interesting 'bank' setup where you crumble cards down a pyramid after buying from the bottom row; thus giving it that extra little edge of theme. There are also multiple uses for the cards, as they all have unique powers you can put into play rather than spend them as currency. There is a set collection aspect where you'll score big the more different items in a particular set you've entombed. Just a solid, fun entry into this genre of card game.

RATING: 8
An great small deck-building game with a few clever twists that make rise above the others. The game takes Dominion's Money, Action and Victory Point Cards and combines them into a single type of card. But one each turn, cards are either as money OR their printed action, not both; cards are only worth VPs when entombed and out of the game (mostly).

Thus there two balance acts at play here: a short-term turn-by-turn choice of using the cards as actions vs. using them as money to get the optimal cards into your deck, and a long-term game of cycling cards out your deck and into your tomb as soon you don't need them. The game feels like the tableau-builders San Juan and Race for the Galaxy, you're balancing the money value of those cards versus the value of the card in your tableau. In particular, it feels a bit like Glory to Rome in that a big part of the game is trying to control the stock and flow of cards between various pools in the game (e.g. the hand, pool and resources in GtR; hand, discard and market in VotK).

The game has a randomly determined market for new cards, like Ascension and Star Realms, but again with a few clever twists. Cards are in a 'pyramid' of rows of 1 - 2 - 3 cards, with the bottom row being the actual market that cards are purchased (cards allow player to take a card from the other two rows as well). Once a card is purchased or taken, the pyramid 'crumbles', with the card in the upper row replacing the lower card. So it adds an element of strategy to the buying phase.

The only downside is that the scoring seems a little too simple and prone to runaway leaders. Cards mostly score in sets, with the square of the number of unique cards in that set. Still highly recomened.

Has fast become one of my favourite deck builders of choice. The combos you can pull off are really rewarding, but knowing when to send something to your tomb for the final scoring is a great mechanic.

A 900-dik játék, amit próbáltam:) Nekem tetszett! Dominionhoz hasonlították. Két nagy pozitívum a dominionnal szemben: az egyik hogy középről a piramisból vesszük el a lapokat, ez változatosabb (mondjuk szerencsefüggőbb is). És a másik, ami rohadt jó dilemmát visz bele, hogy csak amit félreteszünk, az ér pontot a végén, és egy jó lap sokat is tud, de emellett sok pontot is érhet, és ha későn kezdjük félretenni a lapokat, a kezünkben ragadhatnak. Nekem az nem tetszett, hogy a legnagyobb kombó el is dönti kb. az egészet. Ha valakinek van egy 7x7-es kombója, a másiknak meg csak 6x6 sikerült, akkor nagy eséllyel a 7-es kombó nyer, vagyis kb. elég a legnagyobb kombóra figyelmi, a többi nem sokra jó. A 6-os kombó mellé szerintem nagy átlagban legalább 4-5 többletlap kellene, hogy kompenzálja a 7 lapos kombót.

Quite a blunt collection card game (theme wise) that actually intrigues players with the different ways of using a card and especially with the timing in entombing it. Fascinating, puts the game apart from so many others of the same category.

Although I give it a 6, it is just because I do understand that it has some original points, and the game itself works fine.  But I would not play it again, I don't mean to say it is a bad game, it is just not may game.  Maybe I could play online, by turns, but there is too much text for me to manage in what is supposed to be a kind of fast game.
The decayof the pyramid system seems quite original.

Here it is: a deckbuilder game bringing back in me the will of playing a deckbuilder! After having tried many designs, I was burnt out of the mechanic (although I enjoy it as part of larger designs) and played a little just on iOS (Ascension and now Star Realms)... but Valley lit the candle again!

The game is pretty much a straightforward deckbuilder, with a couple of twists: the cards can be bought from a crumbling pyramid, and you need to "retire" cards you want to score (so you need to balance the will to use of powerful cards against the necessity of retiring them).

These little twists make the game play differently enough to other deckbuilders, and the hands rarely "play themselves" without real choices, that I enjoy it quite a lot.

But Valley of the Kings has another great selling point: it's cheap (half price compared to most other deckbuilders) and is absolutely portable! I love that small box!

I really enjoy this deck builder!  I love how the main decision point is to remove cards from your deck to score points or to keep them for their ever increasing power.  It seems like every card is useful for something, even the starters, because every card will score you something at the end of the game, can be used as gold, or used as an action.

Initial Impressions:
-----------------------
The game is fun, although I do wonder how much replay-ability is in the game.  Basically you use every card in every game, which is different than most deck builders that have come out.  One of my favorite things about Dominion is how much variety it offers, however this one doesn't have that element.  I also hate the theme & graphic design / artwork, and in fact these are the reasons I was on the fence about picking it up, even after a couple of glowing reviews from people I share similar taste with.  Looking forward to seeing how it handles more players, but 2p was interesting.  A little longer than I expected, but all in all, for the $12 or so the game cost, the game is worth checking out.

I am enjoying this game so far.  A nice new break on deck builders; not only must you build a solid deck, but your need to entomb requires a fine balance between offense, defense, and self-preservation.

Update 1/6/2015:  Game upgraded from an 8 to a 9.  I have more and more fun playing this game and the strategy seems to get deeper and deeper in multi-player without becoming overbearing.  This thing is a gem.

I would suggest multiple plays would be good in order to learn the card interactions, and would cause play/strategy/interaction to be maximized.

For a deck builder there is a lot of player interaction.

Look forward to playing this more.

Played this with included "Solo Variant" from the rulebook.

Awful, horrible, terrible dreck.
It ruined any possibility of me playing this, ever again.

The fact that "Any cards that mention another player" are stripped of their entire ability (not just an "ignore other player req") causes a little over 50% of the cards to just be flotsam. Couple this with the fact that you still need to collect them to create your sets (as you must have sets of EVERYTHING possible), and you're in for a tedium of a deckbuilder.

It could have been improved in at least a few other ways/rules edits, but as is, I'll consider it unplayable. It would be far more fun to take the deck, all in hand, and organize them into the piles required to win. Seriously, how the Solitaire variant ever made it into print and out the door baffles me.

A pity, as I like the art, and theme….

I'll keep it at 4 until I can play it with others (IF that happens, I sold my copy). If it's better or worse, I'll adjust my rating then….

RATING: 10
Might be a 10, just need to play it more :)

Superb deck-builder, with a theme that fits. The genius design is your cards only score if you've entombed them, so the anguish is do you keep the card for the powerful effect or entomb it for the VP, furthermore as the game develops you find you want to entomb more and more for a big score.

Scales well between 2 and 4 (not tried the solo variant), game is different with player counts and strategies for 1 won't necessarily work with a different count.

Quick, portable, just awesome.

** Update - now a 10 (all of them really, not tried mixing)

A really fun deck builder. It can last a little bit too long for what it is in my opinion, but I still rate it quite highly - it was an instant addition to my collection.

This is a clever little card game where this is a central tension between earning points and action cards into your deck, and banking them out of your deck and into VPs.   

It's ultimately a timing game, where the goal is to find that sweet spot where you start to earnestly bank points.  Quite enjoyable, and the wife even gives this a thumbs up.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ Nice compact deck-building game, that have players interaction and that have an interesting twist in thinning the deck to score the cards (entombing).
++ The theme is well integrated with the mechanisms and the the setup.
++ There is a really nice sense of escalation, the first few rounds doing not much and only buying one card at a time, but, by the end of the game, we can completely take out almost every cards from the pyramid doing awesome combos, and entombing a lot of cards for a lot of points.
++ Just different enough from VotK:Afterlife: same mechanisms so you don't have to learn a new game rules, but cards ability are surprisingly different and thus you must play differently. This version is more about drawing more cards, sacrificing card for ability, and making all the opponents discard or sacrificing cards (more non-targeted "attack" cards, thus this game is more confrontational). This give short turns where you have less cards in hands with almost nothing to be able to do, and some longer turn with bigger hands thus more combos, so the game flow is more like a roller coaster. This game as almost nothing that discourage having a super thin deck, and thus it's the best strategy to follow IMO: to have a super thin deck of well chosen cards that combo well together. 
-- The replayability in 2-players games can be a bit lower, as we often knows what the other player is trying to accomplish (since in every games we will see all the same cards, but in a different order).
++ Easy to teach, ultra-fast to set-up and fast to play.


:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- The first few games are rather long (60-75 min.) to get used to the card abilities (reading the cards), and this can make some new player back off from this game.
-- The replayability of a single VotK game is lower when played at the 2 players count and always against the same opponent (as it is my case) as part of the variability is how the players play the game and what strategy they try.
-- The contrast of colors between the set is lower in this orignal game, and for 2 sets (Canopic Jars and Amulets), it may be hard to tell apart in low light settings.

Just played once, but rather liked. A pretty straight-ahead deckbuilder with the twist that you need to get cards out of your deck and into your tomb for them to be worth points. So you need to balance hanging on to powerful cards with eventually retiring them. Nice mix of some attack and defense cards too. Derivative, but in a way that's totally fine - it mixes things up a bit and feels quite different from other deck-builders even though the mechanisms are quite similar. Nice price point too, and the Egyptian art on the cards and set-collection theme work well enough. Tip: this one is generally about keeping your deck quite small (~10-15 cards, with that number shrinking as the game goes on), but hanging on to a coherent set of abilities as you retire cards.

Interesting twist on the standard deckbuilding game: Do I want to use this powerful card I bought for its abilities or do I want to entomb it to score points at the end? You're constantly seeking a balance between using and scoring cards. Plays pretty quick 30-45 mins with 3-4 people.

This is a really unique and fun little deckbuilder. The pyramid market makes for some randomness without needing an enormous box of hundreds of cards, but allows for enough forward planning during the game so as not to be a frustrating experience. 

In theory it seems like it [i]should[/i] give you some information on what your opponent is likely to have up for purchase on their turn, but it actually doesn't really work out that way. Most of your starter cards allow you to switch things around in the pyramid, so there's not a lot you can do to prevent them from getting any particular card.

But the real star here is the multi-use cards. This is a system I just love in pretty much anything, and it works [i]especially[/i] well in a deckbuilder. I have no doubt that we'll be seeing more games that do this. There's just a ton of rich choices here in regards to building your deck and scoring points.

It's also fun to play a deckbuilder where your deck size shrinks over time, rather than increases. It not only feels refreshingly unique, but it also means that at the end of the game when you're buying all these big, expensive cards you actually get to use them fairly often which makes late-game purchases a lot more exciting.

Update: Tried with 3 players and it's an entirely different game. Very, VERY frantic - the time pressure is amped up hugely and it's much harder to get combos going. It also feels a little less interactive as the market changes entirely by the time it gets back around to your turn. I think this will remain a 2 player game for me.

RATING: 8
Valley of the Kings is an enjoyable, unique deck builder that's small enough to take in your luggage, yet deep enough to warrant play-throughs by newbie and experienced gamers alike. Unlike some deck-builders in which you build your hand, then remove less-helpful cards late in the game, VotK adds two elements that make it shine: 

1) Entombing. Players face some serious decisions with most of the cards inasmuch as they have to choose between keeping a powerful card in their hand (and risking forfeiting points at the end of the game) or entombing those card for points. But doing so removes those cards from play, so you lose the actions/money/OMG factor of said cards. Constantly living on the horns of this dilemma adds an element of constant tension to the game, which keeps players involved and engaged from start to finish.  

2) The Collapsing Pyramid. Were the theme of Ancient Egypt not already enough of a draw, the ability to manipulate cards and they move down the "collapsing" pyramid adds an additional "wow" factor. While I appreciate the marketplace of games like Dominion and Star Realms, having the ability to pick a card from the pyramid, then choose which card comes down (and thereby allowing it to become an option for the other player) is empowering. It's not so much "screw your buddy" as it is passively screwing them, which is a nice twist. I'm not denying you a good card, I'm just giving you first choice at a less-optimal one. 

Between these two unique mechanics, along with an excellent thematic spin, Valley of the Kings is a top-tier, light-to-medium deck builder. It's portable, yet powerful, which means it can go anywhere and appeal to just about anyone.

I have been really enjoying this game - I love how you can choose between using a card for it's monetary value OR it's effect, deciding if the effect is worth the amount you could use as money. I love how at different times during the game the monetary value of a card can be more important and later in the game the effect is more important. I love agonising over which cards to entomb and when. Amazing 2 player game. I have played it once as a three player and it was very slow, however the other person was new to the game so that likely contributed. For me though, this is a fantastic portable 2-player game :)

Very enjoyable deckbuilder with small table and shelf footprint. The pyramid look ahead structure provides a nice strategic element, and the card special abilities seem well balanced. Love the entombing and pyramid manipulation mechanisms. Better than Dominion in all respects, especially the expansion bloat. 

Quite a novel little game, and the NPC solo version is a cracker too. Keeper.

This is an excellent game!  A whole lot is packed into a small package.  

Most of my plays have been with two players, but there have been a few with three and four.  The strategy you must employ changes with the number of players (partly as you get fewer turns).  

There doesn't seem to be any sort of "dominant strategy" that we have found.  Obviously you must entomb cards to win the game, so having actions that let you perform that are quite important, but how you go about exploiting your actions seems to allow for varied methods of winning the game.  

Most enjoyable!

I found this to be a very interesting and fun game. It was fun to attempt to entomb sets of cards,  and it was also fun to use the actions on the cards to pick up more cards or entomb them.

The one drawback for me was that a lot of the actions on the cards seemed kind of useless or tedious.

Other than that, it was great fun to play.

This is a great little deck-building game where you have to decide whether to use your cards for currency, ability, or end-game points. There is a bit of push your luck in deciding if you should use your good card to buy just one more card from the pyramid, or if you are going to entomb it, removing the card from your deck and scoring points for it.

Best deck-builder. Sure, I'm a historian, among other things, but that isn't why. Some deck-builders are just that: a functional, thrown-together deck-builder. They feel heartless and bland. They aren't exciting or intriguing -- they're just screwing for the sake of screwing.
Here it's not screwing. It's making love.
It's like making love underwater, but you know, with more control.
It's a balancing act for sure. What objects to pursue, when to use them, when to spend them, when to bury them.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is an "interactive" (i.e. competitive) deck builder, and I think that's why it doesn't appeal to me. If you're main enjoyment from games comes from tactically/strategically defeating your opponent when the points are counted, this game will appeal to you because it has some depth/complexity that rewards good players. But, if you just want to do something interesting (i.e. "fun') during the game, I didn't find as much of that as I wanted. I was hoping I would enjoy the decision of when to entomb cards, but it mostly just came down to a mad dash at the end. However, I did like the theme/art, and I did (in a small way) enjoy the idea of taking the cards in my tomb with me when I died. Also, the number of attack cards in the game didn't appeal to me. I would rather win by building a better engine than destroying my opponent's. I guess I'm a fan of multi-player solitaire more than I realized.  

Overall, my wife and I found ourselves thinking that we would just rather play Dominion. Maybe we've been brainwashed (I don't know), but Dominion is just more "fun" for us.

A neat little deck builder based in ancient Egypt.  The idea is that you have 10 starter cards and in front of you a deck which builds a 6 card pyramid.  On your turn you deal yourself 5 cards as per most deck builders and then you may buy a card from the pyramid, use an action on a card in your hand or, and here's the little twist, entomb a card.

To entomb means to place a card out of the way for scoring at the end of the game and and different amounts of cards in different sets score various amounts of points.  

I like this one, there is no huge box, no mess and no fuss, it plays in about 30 mins and is perfect as a filler with 2,3 or 4 players.

Eddig csak egyedül sikerült kipróbálnom, de nekem egyenlőre bejön, habár nem sok pakliépítős játékot ismerek (Dominion számítógépen). Családi kategóriába sorolnám, mert nem túl sok szabálya van, az előkészítése ha 2 percet vesz igénybe már sokat mondtam, 1 órán belül véget ér, ha valaki megismeri a lapokat pörgősebb is lehet, a szerencse faktor adott, hiszen kártyajáték. A legfontosabb megtalálni az egyensúlyt a pakliépítés és a "síremlék építés" között. Minimálisan lehet egymásnak keresztbe tenni, de én magamat annyira nem bántottam :). A téma egyébként bármi lehetne, végül ügyesen van tálalva az egyiptomi körítés. A családba elfér egy ilyen is, habár nem hiszem, hogy kiszorítaná akár a Dominion-t is.

A small game that gives the relatively same gameplay of the original basic set of Dominion in a tiny portable box.  This is essentially pocket-Dominion on-the-go and great for trips when you can’t haul around a standard size game box.  I also like the historical notes added to the bottom of each card thus making it an educational game of sorts.  Very classy artwork too; honestly this game should be sold in the museum store in the New York Metropolitan’s Egyptian section.

RATING: 6.5
VotK packs a lot into a small box. There are some interesting twists to the DB-genre, but I'm not sure I'm onboard with the designer's views on what to improve from Dominion. With 90-odd cards, all cards always appear and there is little variation or replayability (as we seem to primairly play our favourite action cards).  The pyramid is fine, but I didn't like that instead of the 16 (10+3+3) card purchase choices I'm used to in Dominion, I'm limited to only 3.  Three!  I found the game well-themed, but not 'thematic'.  The card actions do not seem tied into the cards' names or pictures and I am still dubious why a book or a statue will provide me with gold. This didn't make sense - though I know the designer wanted to have gold, actions and VP available on every card.  The cards are expensive in VotK and it was nigh impossible to pull off many of DB-style combos that I love (there aren't enough +1 draws). VotK briskly trundles along, but there comes an inflection point when you need to reduce your deck and place your scoring (expensive) cards into your set-aside, scoring pile (tomb).  These cards are removed from your deck. Many or most of your expensive cards, providing high gold and cool abilities should be removed in order to ensure they score their VP.  This is exacerbated in the late stages, because it's when the best cards come out, the deck is quickly emptying and it's a tough choice whether to retain for later turns or entomb now. Sutter's Mill has this race to build and expand and then rush to shrink your deck/tableau by game end to score. I find this interesting, but also somewhat frustrating and counter-intuitive and VotK is to me rather a deck builder/db deconstructer, as opposed to a 'pure DB'.  And any remaining player decks are all discarded at game-end. So this is the crux of the game and is not always satisfying.  Afterwards one of us would suggest we instead play Dominion next.  VotK is a good game and fun, but samey and I too think why not play Dominion or Star Realms next time and choose amongst 16 cards (or 6) to buy rather than just 3.  Again, VotK is good and one that will remain in my collection and a great buy, but as I'm not enamoured with the entombing aspect goal, I rarely get it to the table that often.  Being small and portable, it's good for travelling though (like Star Realms).

A few other things:  Art is excellent. Like NetRunner, VotK has these silly, special names for standard piles (eg. 'boneyard'=trash, 'stack'=deck, 'tonb'=score pile).  The scoring (by squaring same colours) is decent, but I didn't understand thematically, why more books or more statutes increase scoring exponentially. I know this is a design choice, but perhaps expansion cards could reward duplicated or varied tomb artifacts (like how the science cards work in 7W).  And speaking of that, I'm disappointed the system hasn't really been able to evolve in the later expansions. I don't know if the designer ran out of ideas, but perhaps the game system doesn't have the legs Dominion or Thunderstone do.  I'd really like to some more vigour added in future - maybe a priest or tombraider effect.

A deceptively deep deck-builder.  The player interaction is limited, but can be decisive at/near the end (for example, taking a card another player wants to further-enlarge an already big set).

The learning curve in the first game is steep because most of the "rules" is actually the text on the cards.  After the first game however, it is smooth-sailing.

I would recommend that any new players read through the rules threads to check if they have misinterpreted any of the rules before playing a second time.  Do NOT try to play this with non-gamers.  It is NOT a filler or gateway game;  it is an excellent gamer's game.

- not too much variation of strategy available in small deck
- nothing really new/innovative in the design


My first play was bound to be my last. I dislike Egyptian themed games immensely. I can't think of any other theme I dislike more (though Ancient Rome would be a close second, and Ancient Greece I'm ambivalent about). I understand this is unrelated to the game design, but it's the main reason I'm giving this game a 4. Honestly, I never want to play it again.

But it [i]is[/i] good design. A little long for what it is, likely to get repetitive, but the core idea of a simple deck-builder with tough choices is well-worked, and the price is good for what you are getting.

Worse for this little game is that it will likely be compared to Star Realms, an infinitely more popular game. Star Realms is simpler, I think, but it has a theme that seems more popular, and plays quicker.

Egy újabb deckbuilding, ezúttal egyiptomi piramisépítős témával. Szerintem úgy jött az alapötlet, hogy látták, hogy a többi deckbuilding kulcsa mindig a kukázás, ezért csináltak egy olyat, amiben szinte minden lap ezt tudja. Szóval itt inkább az lesz a gond, hogy egyáltalán maradjon valahogy lapod. Jópofa ötlet, hogy maguk az akció/pénz kártyák érnek pontot a végén, de csak akkor ha berakok a tombba őket. Ráadásul általában a jobb képességű kártya több pontot ér, így meg kell érezni azt a pontot, amikor megéri kidobálni. A piramisos center row-nak nem sok értelmét látom mechanikailag, inkább csak egy kis plusz tematikus ízt visz a játékba.
Ami viszont fura volt az az, hogy a kártyáknak egy-két kivételtől eltekintve szerintem nagyon gyengék a képességei. Egyiknél se éreztem azt, hogy na akkor ez most kell nekem. Szintén fura, hogy a seteknél bizonyos szímből csak 3 van, másból meg 7 is, de ugyanúgy négyzetesen pontozódnak. Nem sok értelmét látom így a annak, hogy a ritkábbat kezdjem el gyűjteni.

Having to excise cards from your deck in order to score is an interesting change from the deck-building archetype but it is not sufficient to raise it above the level of "generic Dominion clone with a twist". And everything else right down to the theme is really generic, and even though most of the cards have subtly different card texts they are all just minor variations of the same three or four basic actions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A neat deckbuilder, although the pyramid crumbling thing seems a little gimmicky. It's interesting though. I like the tomb mechanic where you have to ditch your good cards. In 2 player it's a little too easy to ruin the other player's day if you take a bunch of take-that cards. Like with Dominion I'm more interested in games that aren't pure deckbuilding lately.

A great twist on the deck building theme. Really enjoyed the Egyptian theme, everything just flowed. Love the push your luck elements. I also enjoyed not having a limit on the amount of actions you could take on your turn as long as you could satisfy what it wanted...made for an interesting twist. My only quibbles are #1, it ran a titch too long for what it was and #2 not that much player interaction...could of had more. Overall, this is such a thick meaty game for the price..well well worth it!!

RATING: 7
Reminds me of a small box game (the publisher). It is easy to undervalue the set collection mechanic and get some stupidly imbalanced scores. While it's refreshing to reward the player who knows the game best, it is a pretty brutal kick in the teeth for someone who doesn't know the game. There is a little too much to keep track of in everyone's piles for my tastes. You have to have a plan, know the cards, and be fully engaged in everyone else's plays at all times. While this is nice in theory, it ends up limiting socializing and relaxing, which is the best part of gaming.

I'm quite surprised how well this one played! A small-box card game and a variation of the standard deck builder mechanics, but it just works so well! The decision to either keep a card for the action/money or 'entomb' it for points is a very smart system! I could see replayability getting stale with seeing the same cards over and over again, but for its size I think it works wonderfully. Good work, Tom Cleaver and AEG!

Original deckbuilding game with a good use of the egyptian theme. It's present everywhere from the card layouts to the game mechanics: The shop is a pyramid which crumbles when you remove cards, and the only way to score cards is to place them in your tomb. This creates an interesting situation where you have to store away your good cards during the game, or they'll be worthless in the end.

It's also very portable!

I tried this 2p with my wife and was reminded how much I don't like deckbuilders. The drafting part is interesting but honestly the abilities of the cards really weren't exciting. Also, my wife was on her phone the entire time we were playing and could not be persuaded to focus on the game because she was so uninterested. If you're thinking about getting this game I'd recommend 7 Wonders: Duel instead. The drafting mechanism is similar and the game is 1000x more fun. My wife loved this game and was engaged the entire time we were playing. Valley of the Kings is going on the trade pile and 7 Wonders: Duel is going straight into the stash of games to play with my wife.

RATING: 7
A deck builder with a twist.  This game has a nice mechanic for buying cards and scoring victory points, but the real strength is in the way you can steal, trade and manipulate cards in other players decks.  You add cards to your deck throughout, but only score points if you remove them from the game completely, so there is a lot of difficult decisions around whether to keep a card for it's play value or stash it for it's VP's.  Throw into the mix the fear of it being stolen by another player and replaced with Junk and this game quickly adds layers of strategy to a simple premise.  Sadly the graphics are dull and un-inspiring and the rules are a little poorly explained.

Estupendo deckbuilding que tiene las ventajas de los otros juegos con su misma mecánica pero que arregla el mayor defecto  que los deckbuilding presentan; el efecto bola de nieve. Y esto es gracias a la mecánica de enterramiento, llega un momento que hay que decidir entre conservar cartas poderosas (y arriesgarse a perder muchos puntos en una colección) o enterrar para llevarse los puntos y asegurar la victoria. 

El factor azar está presente, como es obvio pero el nivel de control sobre el juego es bastante satisfactorio.

El mejor deckbuilding al que he jugado, muy superior a los Star Realms, Dominions o, incluso, al Valle de los Mercaderes.

This is a very original deck building game. Your main goal is to fill your tomb with the most valuable artifacts while at the same time you are trying to make sets of them. It is always hard choice because you would like to use your cards attribution as they can be really powerful. I quite like the unique theme with such an eyecatching artwork paired with it. I think this is a better game than Dominion overall because there are just a few duplicate cards in the deck. The chances your opponent will strike you with the same cards is low so they must find another way on their effort for victory. I love the huge amount of interaction the game grants which sometimes are direct in the face style. Even the pyramid mechanism is clever because it offers an opportunity to think ahead. I believe this game can be one of the best price / value title in the whole market. As the fact that this is a highly language dependent game and unfortunatelly there is no hungarian version is a big downside to buy this one.

Meiner Meinung nach eine bessere Variante von Dominion, da man mit den erworbenen Karten etwas tut. Es entsteht eine Auslage im "Grab" eines jeden Spielers und man kann seinen Spielfortschritt sehen. Die Entscheidung wann ich eine Karte ablege um später dafür Punkte zu bekommen oder sie weiterhin im Deck zu behalten um ihren Effekt zu nutzen ist eine angenehmere Variante von dem in Dominion bewehrten Prinzip, nur dass ich hier mein schönes Deck nicht wieder zerstören muss.

First played June 13th, 2015. This is a decent card game where you are deck building and scoring victory points by tombing your cards. Each person starts out with an equal starting hand of 10 cards. Shuffle and get 5 to start. You can use your cards as an action, money, or tomb it for victory points. You buy better cards with cards in your hands (as money). When the center deck runs out the game is over. Count your tombed victory points to see who won. Some cards double for each different card of that same color you have.

I really like archaeology and we both like deck building games.  We both enjoyed this game and are looking forward to playing more.  The first game was interesting to learn what cards were best in what situations and in discovering that the statue set (with 7 statues to collect) was a key in winning the game. We also waited until near the end to do most of our entombing, so next time I think we'll be entombing more earlier and racing to deplete the pyramid.  We also only played with two and are interested to see how the game plays with 3 or 4.

Picked it up for $20 at Barnes & Noble on a whim. Glad I did.

See [b][thread=1277116]my strategy guide[/thread][/b] in the game's Strategy forum section.

If you like [b][thing=36218]Dominion[/thing][/b] and [b][thing=69789]Ascension[/thing][/b], then you'll probably like this game (if you don't like Dominion you might still like this game). It's a small game that is very easy to set up, learn, and play. There is also some good strategy in it. It gets quite tense at the end as you scramble to score cards that you need.

This game requires careful balance in order to win. It's tough to get it right, and you have to make some difficult decisions in the game.

Quick setup, easy to play, lots of strategy. Top notch game.

The game quality is very good, the cards and the box both being linen finished. Otoh the linen finish can make the cards sticky after a few plays. Sleeves are necessary.

[Edit: after a dozen plays increasing rating to a 9. I love this game.]

This is one of those games where I imagine the designer played Dominion and said to himself, "Dominion would be awesome if only...."  Each one brings their own "if only" to the game.  Really, I'd rather just play Dominion.  In this one, you have to know how to time the game so your good cards are useful during the game and yet score for you at the end.  It was not at all clear to me how close we were to the end at any given time.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (September 2015)

Valley of the Kings is an ok deckbuilding game. The rules are dead easy, furthermore if you have played Dominion or the like before. The art is good. The cards themselves are few, that is, it is a very small game.

I played it as a four player game and the downtime was excessive, as most deckbuilding games out there, I prefer to play it as a two player game. The game decisions aren’t that hard, but they aren’t obvious either. You have to carefully consider what do you want to buy because there is a set collection aspect (the more cards you have from the same set, the better). When you play each card, you have to consider if you want to use it as money or to use the effect. Also you have to decide when you will entomb your cards, and that’s not an easy decision. All things considered, Valley of the Kings offers good fun.

I like the theme.

Valley of the Kings offers a fresh take on the genre with two new things I haven’t seen before. The first one is that to actually score points, you have to “entomb” your cards, so you no longer automatically win the VPs if you have the card in your deck, I like it. Second, I generally don’t like deckbuilding games in which the cards appear in a variable offering (like Legendary or Ascension). In Valley of the Kings the cards are also variable, but you can only buy the cards at the bottom of the pyramid, the other cards can be glimpsed and thus planned for. This reduces the luck of the draw a bit making the game more strategic and less tactical, still it isn’t ideal for me but it is considerable better than Legendary´s way, besides the cards offering is arranged in a pyramid form, so it is thematic as well.

At first I thought I wouldn’t like it because it seemed it had too few cads for a deck builder game, but so far, I enjoy it. However I’m worried about the replayability factor, it seems it can be rather low because you use every card in each game, fortunately Valley of the Kings is easily expandable so I think that can solve the issue for me (if it exists).

Bottom line, I like Valley of the Kings and for now it has a spot in my game collection.

I finally played Valley of the Kings as a two player game and it was VERY long. I thought that was the best configuration but I was wrong. The game has a problem, with 4 players the downtime is excessive and with 2 players the game takes very long. Some cards shouldn´t be used when you play with two players. Perhaps it is best with 3 players but my desire to play it again is low. I think I will sell my copy of the game.

After a few plays, this game has finally clicked with me -- decent game with an interesting scoring mechanism. Still not a huge deck-builder fan, but I do enjoy this one.

RATING: 6
A lot of depth and replay value for such a small and inexpensive game. Tal der Könige is a deck builder with restrictions on the cards available for purchase, enough interactive cards to avoid a multiplayer solitaire feeling and the one unique mechanism that only cards cycled out of the deck to the tomb are worth points. The focus is on deck thinning, the combo building part is replaced by collecting sets in the tomb.
I can't rate it higher for now than Dominion as I don't enjoy deckbuilding too much but it's a fine effort for the genre. With more experience my appreciation might rise though as my first game was negatively affected by getting my deck demolished beyond enjoyment.

It might be time to stop looking for another fun deck-building game. Nothing will ever match Dominion. I enjoy this because it is modest. They're not really ripping off too much of Dominion, and the idea of banking cards is interesting, sort of like opposite Dominions VP clogging cards. This makes the game move a little too quickly at the end, but it is different enough to play once in a while.

With two, this is an interesting take on deckbuilding. The tomb and pyramid mechanisms both add an interesting twist to the game. With more than two, it becomes a very slow affair, as you can't plan much. Regardless of player count, the game is just a bit too long, but is still enjoyable, albeit on an irregular basis.

Excellent little deckbuilder. It didn't manage to catch my attention before Zee Garcia brought it up in the "Under the radar"-segement of his show.

And he's right about it. Somehow it got lost in the shuffle with Star Realms being the obviously smash hit in the category of small cardgames.

But the idea of giving up your powerful cards over the course of the game to score points in the end, the timing aspect of when to put them in your tomb... that's just excellent and unique and makes Valley of the Kings a keeper.

RATING: 7
I like this game even though I've rated it a 5/10. It allows for a lot of interesting strategic options given that it's a deckbuilder with a small deck. Unlike Dominion, you shouldn't start with a pre-conceived strategy. You need to develop your strategy in response to when the cards come out and how your opponents play. Even so, I don't have a lot of desire to play this. The main reason it will stay in my collection is that it plays 2-4, it has a small footprint, and it travels well. So while I don't think it's an awesome game, it works really well for certain situations that come up a lot in my life. So it's a keeper.

It's basically a deck building game where you score what you have ditched into your tomb.

The good elements in the game is that you can discard a card to your tomb each turn makes it easier to thin your deck. The double use of cards money vs ability is also another interesting aspect. And scoring only your tomb is also an interesting mechanics because buying good cards does not makes you score them automatically.

Now for the bad aspect, the scoring system is designed that in a way that you only need to stash 1 type of cards make make a huge amount of points. This just makes it broken. Changing the scoring value for sets could avoid this bug. Personally, I would have encourages variety instead of sets.

The other problem is that you use basic cards to get medium cards which gives you more money and are worth more victory points. You then use those cards to buy advanced cards which are worth even more.

Now the problem is that if you dump the cards you bought in your tomb. You get stuck with only the basic cards in your hand which are not valuable enough to actually buy advanced cards. So in the end, the strategy is to accumulate as much cards as you can, then dump your cards as rapidly as you can. If you dump your basic cards, your deck is more efficient, but it does not give you any points. It does not hinder your still.

One of the player complained that all deck building games start with weak cards and then you get stronger as you play, he would have loved to play strong cards right at the beginning of the game.

Most people would say that it would not be possible to do a game like that, but With Valley of Kings, they could have done that. They could have made beginning cards as strong as the last ones since you need to sacrifice them to score, so you won't abuse their power indefinitely. You will have to get rid of them eventually to score. But instead of discarding them all at the end of the game, you would be able to do it through the game.

A big rating drop over the last year, Valley of the Kings is a very solid deck builder, and I still do love the tomb mechanism.

RATING: 7.5
Underrated deck builder that has deceiving depth due to how you score points with the Tomb. The three standalone games really improve the replayability and variety. I now have the game stored by sets and just randomly pick sets that total the base game card number. Creates very interesting and dynamic games and combos you haven't experienced before. I play mainly 2 player.

CONS:
-artwork is a little weak, even if they have improved it with each game.
-length in a 2 player game. Just a tad too long sometimes (depending on how many cards you sacrifice or buy from the pyramid) although you could shorten it by removing a set of cards from each play (I haven't tried this yet)
-each standalone game has a slightly different hue to the cards so if you were to really study the cards, you could tell which game they belonged to.

Overall, an excellent game that I have played and look forward to playing many times.

*Includes plays of Afterlife and Last Rites.

The deck deconstruction (trashing your cards is the method of scoring VP) is an interesting twist on deckbuilding and engine building. I'm not really a fan of the few "if you get lucky, steal a good card from your opponent" cards, though. The set collection (VPs are scored as the square of the set size) also makes the luck of a key acquisition a bit outsized for my money.

Surprisingly engaging deck builder for such a small box. The fact that you only score points from cards you remove from your deck (by placing them in your tomb) forces you to make some tough decisions while keeping your deck nice and trim. Quite possibly the best deck builder for the price point.

RATING: 8
Wow, i'm impressed with how well done this one is. It's not enough that you buy good cards, but you also have to go a step further and move them one at a time to your entombment pile to be able to score them. And scoring is driven by a very nice set collection element, where you square the number of different cards you have for each color, so four different green cards would award you with 16 points. I like this scoring because it awards players for specializing in a color, and doesn't punish them for not getting some of each kind. It's flexible, and every card scores you at least something, you don't have to wait for an exact set of 3 to be able to score. And this game has a great amount of trashing starter cards, and the ability to keep your deck thin so that you can get to your good cards faster. When i finished the game i had less cards in my deck than what i started with. Also the cards have great historical text on them, so you can learn something while you play; i felt this helped immerse me into the theme. There's a lot of game for the money. My favorite deckbuilder now.

FUN: due to the three functions of each card, this packs a lot more punch in a tiny box than Dominion. Very streamlined and balanced.

UNIQUE: has a lot more interaction than most deckbuilders. Also, feels like this game might actually get worse with the addition of more cards, rather than better.

NEGATIVES: the pyramid display is a tiny bit fiddly.

It's small, easy to pack, and simple to play. One of the simpler deck builders out there in terms of mechanics, but lots of decisions to make.

Lack of setup options though reduce the variability of the game, reducing replayability. I probably wouldn't ever play this twice in a row.

Of all the deckbuilding games I tried (Dominion, Thunderstone Advance, Nightfall, Arctic Scavengers, Quarriors), this one I liked the most.

Very similar in feel to Dominion (start with a 10 card deck, draw a hand of 5, discard your entire hand at the end of your turn) but with the addition of a tricksy scoring system that keeps you on your toes. Cards only score at the end of the game if they are in your tomb, so you have to decide whether to use a card for its gold value, its ability or whether to bank it for its score value.
Nice thematic art and clear graphic design make this an enjoyable play.

In this deck building game you may acquire cards from the bottom of a pyramid, then replacement cards fall down from the upper pyramid to fill. The cards have special abilities, and you are trying to stash cards into your tomb for VPs.

Fantastic deckbuilder. The entomb mechanic really sets this game apart from the others I've tried. You have to be able to effectively balance putting a steady stream of cards into your tomb while making sure that you don't undercut your purchasing power too much. At the same time, you have to watch for other players playing "Sacrifice" cards against you (keep those Offering Tables!) which will trash your cards without giving you points at the end.

I also really dig the theme. Give me ancient Egypt over men in tights or Renaissance village any day.

A very strong, small deck-builder that plays up to four.  I really enjoy the game-play of being able to take a card and use it for either purchasing power, a special action, or to score points.  I have enjoyed the game every time it has hit the table and easily recommend it.

I've only played a 2er so far, which I found engrossing. The player's turn plays almost exactly like Dominion, but with unlimited buys and actions, which I found exhilarating. But the lifting of that constraint comes with it the increased probability of devastating combos, so I wonder if the game is balanced. Also, the longevity of Dominion owes much to the fact that there are quite a few ways to choose 10 out of, what, 200? 500? whereas in Valley of the Kings, all cards are in play. Which is to suggest that it might only feel fresh through 5-10 plays. However, these days, for me, a game that can last through 5 plays before feeling like a retread (a mark that, among others, Navegador fails to achieve) is one I'd recommend highly.

an interesting puzzle of a deckbuilder. The abilities on each card are all relevant, and with turns outside of the first few of the game, the possibilities extend far beyond just buying cards from the center. As such, it is more cerebral than something like star realms or thunderstone, and being able to perform exciting combo chains is a very real possibility. Really scratched that itch i had for a very non-linear deck builder

RATING: 7
The game delivers a fair load for a small box. Normal deck-building with an Ascension style 3-card draft, with a 3 card look-ahead dressed up in pyramid shape. There's only one currency, gold, which is used to buy cards. Mainly you buy cards that match the colour of cards you've already bought, because they'll square their points at the end of the game. The game also diverges from standard where it gives you the power each turn to thin your deck, transferring a card from your hand into your score pile. Of course, that card's power and gold are now no longer available to you, so tradeoffs must be made between keeping/scoring low-gold/low-VP cards vs high-gold/high VP cards. I'm not sure I liked the score squaring approach - the difference between getting 4 cards in your colour and 5 is huge and game-defining, especially when it may be just due to the luck of what's available to you in the draft when its your turn. The game's replay is also a bit limited in that you're buying from the same small seeded deck each time, so once you know a certain combo, it's going to keep appearing each game. But exploring the power combos was interesting first time through, and the auto-thinning tradeoffs were interesting, so I enjoyed the game and would happily play it again.

This game has finally convinced me deck building is just not my thing.  The cards in this one get boring after two or three plays.  The pyramid "crumbling" mechanic is interesting at first, but then just gets annoying. I also think a single game tends to overstay its welcome.  It might be ok if it were a 15 or 20 minute game, but we have found even 2 player games last much longer.

Valley of the Kings is a deck-building game in which getting cards out of your deck is just as important as getting them into your deck--cards don't score unless you put them into your tomb pile. Cards are available to be bought through a "pyramid" arrangement; cards in the upper tiers aren't available until cards below them are bought. Cards (except starter cards and special artifacts) once entombed are scored through set collection, with sets being worth the square of the number of unique cards in that set. I really enjoyed the tough decisions of when to entomb your cards, as it prevents you from using that card both that turn and in the future. This game surprisingly packed a lot of strategic punch in a very small package.

I initially pegged this game as just being another simple deck builder with a pyramid twist. Wow, there is a lot here. I was able to pull off a few sweet combos and this game definitely has some legs to it. I don't think it will last past 20-30 plays, but it's got a lot more than meets the eye. 4 players might drag a bit, but 2 seems to be fantastic.

RATING: 7.5
Lot of game in a tiny package. This how small card games should be made - each card can be used in multiple ways. This game stands up to even big box deck builders, it's maybe even deeper than base Ascension for example. Since all the cards are always in play it might mean less replayability than big box games, but that could be fixed with expansions.

This is the best deckbuilder I have played. After a number of plays I've not been able to determine a best strategy. Not even certain that entombing every turn is optimal. I will play this anytime, happily.

nice deckbuilder, I liked how you have to chose to have the cards ability or buying power, and when to start taking them out of your deck so they'll be points. The pyramid of cards was a bit fiddly to keep shifting and filling up again.

RATING: 5
There are some interesting things in this little deck-builder. For example, to score, players remove cards from their decks and add them to the score area. However, then the player will not have access to that card. This makes for some tough and interesting choices on timing. However, I’m not sure there’s enough variety to maintain long-term play, nor is there enough to set VotK apart from the other “like-Dominion-but”s.

Fantastic!  I found this game looking for a deck builder that:

1.) Had a simpler setup and more portability than Dominion
2.) Consisted of a set of cards that had been play tested to work well together. As much as I like Dominion's base set, the expansion & "menu driven" deck construction aspect for a hobbyist-weight deck builder seems inherently wonky because in true "heavy" deck builders (MTG/ANR) a person fine-tunes a deck over many games so that it is balanced like a fine instrument and has specific strengths. But with Dominion, you're always trying new card combinations and frankly, some are brilliant and some are horrible and most games of Dominion seem to end with people saying something like: "Well, that was a pretty good game, but the "x" cards seemed overpowered without "y" cards to offset them, so let's go again, but swap out the "x" cards for something else." In other words, most games of Dominion with expansion cards are essentially play-testing, and those "play testing" games are a lot less fun than when you find a combination of cards that play well together and give fast well-balanced games.
3.) Wasn't "swingy" and hence wasn't plagued by runaway-winners or heavy-handed catchup mechanisms required to offset a swingy nature. As much as I enjoy Star Realms - if a person gets early healing or early shields, the game can run away. I've tried several mods & house rules, but have found that balancing the game takes away from its chaos - the very thing that makes it fun.

This game perfectly fits those requirements:
1.) It's just a deck of cards - fits in a small MTG box & sets up in under a minute if you keep the phases separated.
2.) It's a pre-assembled pre-tested deck of cards. It plays as greasy-smooth and balanced as base-Dominion, but has more advanced player interactions than base Dominion. If I spent a lot of time play-testing some Dominion expansion decks, I bet they'd play a lot like this. In fact, it would almost be worth it to look around for recommendations on people's favorite Dominion setups and just unbox and re-assemble them into several pre-made decks with different types of play... heavy economic / heavy interaction / fast engine building / complex card interactions & etc. Truth be told, I'd rather toss away all my Dominion big-boxes and replace them with half a dozen prefabricated Dominion decks that played well together. The "infinite setup" thing is over-rated because it assumes you like play-testing. Play testing gets old. I'd rather just play an invigorating game.
3.) Valley of the Kings is not swingy at all. If you get your hat handed to you, it's because you didn't play well.

In summary - not only do I love this game, but I'm going to go get the other two versions and start looking around for recommended Dominion setups so I can winnow all my Dominion big-boxes down to a few decks that play well together.

RATING: 7
The pyramid-display is a bit of a fiddley thing with little addition to the gameplay, but the fun part of the game is that you have to entomb your cards to score points, but want those powerful ones to keep as long as possible, without it being too late.  

For the rest it's a very classic deckbuilding game, nothing new on that part.

A pretty straight forward deck building game. But it doesn't have a lot of cards, so it doesn't really have that much variation or room for different experiences between different plays. There are now a lot of other deck building games out there (Dominion, Legendary, Star Realms), which do the same sort of thing better. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
A challenging Ancient-Egypt-themed deck-building game, simple enough to learn for people who've never played a deckbuilder but clever enough to allow some neat plays.  Every card has both a point value, a "coin value" (representing its purchasing power), and an in-game "power" it can be used for.  Every turn, the central game deck reveals more new cards for players to purchase and add to their personal decks.  Players choose between buying new cards or stuffing cards they already own into their "tombs", which are out of play.  At the end of the game, ONLY cards in the Tombs count for points - so there is a neat tension wherein you have to decide how long to keep your power cards and when to begin entombing them to prepare for your afterlife.  Naturally, he or she whose pyramid has the most treasure in it at game's end wins.  Items also come in "sets" of matching colors, creating an extra layer of game interactions where you might avoid using a card to deny an opponent the opportunity to pick it up as it's the last card they're missing from a set to maximize points.  To top it all off, every card represents an item significant to Egyptian art, religion, or burial rites with accurate (if ghoulish) descriptions!

A solid deck building game slapping into a fairly portable box.  The theme is cool (and tragically underutilized, imho), the art is very good, the rules are simple, play is logical and flows well...then why don't I rate this higher?

Dominion is to blame.  This game reminds me too much of Dominion, and Dominion is kind of a dull game.  I think four or five years ago, this game would've been a revelation.  Now, there are dozens of deck builders.  The field is crowded at this point.  

This game's portability is honestly its strongest asset. So if you don't need to carry a deck builder around with you in the off chance someone wants to play one...probably okay to skip it.

An interesting little deck builder, but not quite compelling. I like the tradeoff you have to make between using a card for its action, its gold value, or entombing it for points. I like the progression from Age 1 to Age 3, with more powerful cards coming out over time. I like how small the box is.
I don't like the combinations of card abilities as much as I wanted to, though. Lots of the actions are interesting and seem powerful, but very few of them really click together to make interesting combos or engines. On most turns, I wasn't thinking "Ooh, I really want these two cards, which should I take?". It was more like "Would any of these go well with my deck? Meh, I guess I'll take this one.". Maybe there are nuances I'm totally missing, but I'd like it to be a bit more engaging from the beginning.

RATING: 7
Valley of the Kings is a deck builder game like Dominion but with a limited set of cards, all of which are used in every game. However, that doesn't diminish the replayability because the strategy you will have to use varies on what cards are picked by your opponents, what cards are discarded into the boneyard, and what cards you have (and plan to) entomb on your turn. 

In terms of theme, it is a bit morbid - you are an Egyptian noble who is looking to stuff his tomb with treasures for the afterlife. The card art is appropriate for the theme and the short historical notes on each card serve for added general knowledge about Egyptian pyramid artifacts (if you ever get around to reading them).

RATING: 8
Deck-building games are very much "old hat" these days, of course, at least those which like this are relatively "pure" which do not try to combine deck building with other non-card-based mechanics. I don't have much time for most of them - I am a huge Dominion fan, so why would I play any other deckbuilder but the one which did it perfectly (in combination with expansions, anyway) while inventing the whole genre?

Yet I actually really enjoyed this game on my one play of it so far (I had never heard of the game, it was a friend's copy). The main point of interest here is that, while each card has a certain VP value, you only actually get the points if you manage to "trash" them (to use Dominion-speak) before the end of the game. And, barring card effects, you are only allowed to "trash" one card per turn. This gives rise to very interesting questions about which cards to trash and when - because by converting a card into victory points, you give up being able to use its abilities for the rest of the game, and nor can you very well just "cash everything in" in the last couple of turns.

On my one game so far, I won convincingly by almost lucking into a very thin-deck strategy in the endgame, which let me trash several cards a turn while somehow still keeping half-a-dozen or so cards to form a functioning deck. This was fun, although I don't expect it to happen like this every time. Another fun aspect of the game was that there's a set-collection thing at its heart - you only get big points by getting (and then trashing) several cards from one or more of various sets. This opens up possibilities of denying other players points.

So I really enjoyed this game and would love to give it a few more plays. I can't see my rating rising all that much, because with all the same cards coming out in every game, albeit in a different order, I think that after a certain number of games they wouldn't feel sufficiently different to each other. But I can't be totally sure of this until I've played it many times (which is unlikely to happen, at least not soon), and until then this will always be a game I'm happy to play.

I like quite a few things about this game, but for a game that acts like it wants to be a quick filler, it is on the slow paced side of the spectrum. The games I've played of this have tended to drag on too long.

I do like the set collection aspect of this game- it gives it a nice distinction from many of the other Deck builders out there. The balance of keeping good cards for their effect and removing them from the game so they score points, provides some interesting decisions throughout the game. Unfortunately, I think the set collection aspect, especially in a four player game, is both too random and very chaotic. 

I also like that the deck is split into ages. One of the things that bothers me in other deckbuilders which use a similar style of "draw and display the top X cards from the deck and choose one of those to buy" (Ascension, Legendary, Star Realms, and to an extent Thunderstone) is the fact that high costing cards can clog up your purchase options early in the game. Valley of the Kings steps around this issue fairly nicely by forcing the expensive cards to the bottom of the deck, so you have enough of an economy to buy them by the time they turn up.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a good deck building game. Each card has 3 different things that can be done. You can use it to buy things, use it for the special effect that it has, or you can use it to get VP. It's a small footprint and lasts about 45 minutes. The use special ability or get VP mechanic is the same as in the game Elysium, but is done so much better in this game.

Really good deck builder. I love the twist that you have to store away your cards for them to count towards scoring at the end of the game. Always makes for some hard decisions as often the cards you most want to keep in your deck are the ones you need to stuff in your tomb.

RATING: 7
With a scoring twist this turns out to be an interesting little deck building game. Sure it's got the base Dominion system - which just makes it easier to learn and teach - but they've thrown in just enough unique card abilities and a novel scoring approach to make it stand out. A lovely little game that would be a lot more popular if there were more copies on the market and the price matched Port Royal and other 96 card small box games. Be warned - it can seem a little mean - there are a lot of cards floating around that do evil things.

I think of this as the small box version of Elysium... or actually Elysium as the big box version of Valley of the Kings. Scoring is similar. Plays similarly. You acquire cards, play them and over time transfer your action cards into a victory point pile where they can no longer be used for their actions. Yes, a very similar feel too.

RATING: N/A
Another good deck builder. Honestly, after the rules explanation, I kind of thought I would say that sarcastically or with a bored tone: "well, yet another good deck builder." But after playing, I think it is genuinely another good deck builder.

The game has a fun escalation, where you start out with small, piddly stuff. But then when that last age or group of cards starts to appear, you ramp up pretty quickly. Cards move around the table quite a bit, too, which makes it interesting; you might be taking from someone's discard pile and then put a card in someone else's tomb and then swap a card from your hand with one in your own tomb, not to mention new cards that you buy. It seems important to keep your deck thin, which can be somewhat easy to do, but not too thin because then you can't perform as many actions. Also, the size of the deck and the play length is just about right; not too many cards, but enough to have lots of options.

So it's a good game that I misjudged from the beginning. Nothing super revolutionary, but definitely enjoyable.

Kipróbálás nélkül, csak leírás alapján szereztem be a játékot és elsőre pont azt hozta, amit vártam. Dominion érdekesebb témával és érdekesebb vásárlási résszel. A játékosok a haláluk utáni életre gyűjtik a minél értékesebb kincseket a sírjukba maguk mellé. A lapok amellett, hogy vásárlási erővel bírnak, egy-egy akciót is tudnak, illetve a piramisunkba temetve hozzák a győzelmi pontokat. A játék lényege, hogy mikor milyen lapot ásunk el, amit onnantól nem használhatunk. Fontos a jó időzítés, mert hamar véget érhet a játék. Az illusztrációk szépek, a téma érdekes, a megvalósítás teljesen rendben van, kis helyen elfér. Mi kellhet még? Egy jó játék a VotK.

1 solo, 1 2er

A pretty cool deck-building/deck-thinning, set-collection game in a VERY small package! Differences from Dominion:
- the starting cards aren't totally useless
- available card pool changes in semi-random order (like Ascension, except all Level 2 cards first, then Level 3)
- deck-thinning is not just a requirement to fine-tune your deck, but a vital part of the game
- the removed cards are the ones you actually score, so VP cards DON'T WRECK YOUR HANDS!! 

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Shuffle the Level 3 cards and Level 2 cards separately, then put the 2s on top (= "Stock"). Deal cards to create a Pyramid (3-2-1), and one more to start the discard pile ("Boneyard"). During the game, WHENEVER a card is removed from the Pyramid, it "crumbles": fill in spot by dropping a card from a spot directly above (in the next higher row). Players each start with the same deck; shuffle and draw 5. 

On your turn, in order:
1. Play Cards. 
- use cash value to buy card(s) from base of Pyramid (and immediately crumble)
- use action on card(s)
- place card in your tomb; max 1/turn
2. Discard you hand and cards in play (in any order) to personal discard pile
3. If you did NOTHING with any cards in Pyramid, sacrifice one (remove from game, to Boneyard; crumble immediately).
4. Refill Pyramid to 6 cards
5. Draw up to hand limit (5 cards default)

Players take turns in order (random start) until Stock and Pyramid are empty and all players have had the same number of turns. Score VP for cards in your tomb:
- uniques and starter cards: VP as indicated
- set cards: number of different cards in set, squared

Very unique deck-builder. Definitely a three player game. Don't be fooled by what the box says. The two player game is very long and unwieldy and doesn't feature enough disruption, so the game can easily become very one-sided. The four player game features too much disruption, and doesn't allow players to have an adequate amount of turns to accomplish anything useful.

Deck builder where you have to scrap cards to score them.

Only played a few times so far, so my rating is based on that. Might rate a 10 after more plays.

Really excellent graphics and educational flavor text. Top notch + 1!  That being said, some iconography for the card actions would have been nice.

I love the crumbling pyramid. Every card is agonizing to play: spend it? play it? score it? I didn't really get all the card actions and combinations until I played several games of solitaire (which is quite a challenge).

At first I thought the set collection was annoying and unnecessary ... until I kept playing and realized how heavy it makes the game (in a good way). This ain't no light deck-builder like Ascension or Star Realms. This is definitely kicked-up a notch.

My only gripe (which is preliminary) is that maybe the game goes on a tad too long in a two-player game. Maybe once we know the cards better this won't be an issue.

Still to try this -- 2 player fix that worked with us, removing 15-20 cards lets the game be under a hour but still intense. We remove the high point sets and a few of the single VP cards, but we rotate so we can experience all of them, eventually.

RATING: 8
If I could have only one deck builder, any one of this series of games would be it by a long shot.  I love each installment equally and would highly recommend them to any fan of the genre.  The entomb mechanic in these games allows one to "evolve" one's deck constantly, in order to adapt to the changing game state.  Brilliant.  Could be considered "mean" in terms of types of player interactions involved but, in my opinion, any "mean-ness" in the game is not just pasted on in order to create some form of interaction between players.  Instead, it is carefully considered and implemented, serving to enhance the depth of the game.  Gets better as one learns the cards and becomes familiar with the interactions/combos.  Hard to believe how much "good" is packed in such a small box.

Yes, that's essentially it. There are some changes. In stead of a fixed set of cards, there is a moving card line in the form of a pyramid. And you score points for cards you can remove from your deck to put in your 'tomb'.
It all works fine, but it adds little to the genre.
And I don't like the artwork or card design.

I like almost everything about Valley of the Kings. It packs a nice punch for a small box. The theme and mechanics mesh well. The game play is quick and challenging, and players have plenty of options for clever moves and card combos. The tension caused by finding the correct timing to entomb powerful cards for points vs. keeping them available in your deck is great. So, what's not to like? The attack cards. You can spend the whole game building a nifty deck engine only to have other players cut your hand down to from five to four, three or even two cards, completely crippling you. There's plenty of interaction and ways to hinder your opponents without these game-breaking attack cards, so I'm not sure why the designers felt compelled to put them in. It really saps the fun out of the game for anyone who either choses or is not lucky enough to draft them. The game is still interesting and gets my recommendation, but a card that makes other players discard two-fifths of their hand is overpowered to the point of being broken - a major blemish to an otherwise outstanding game.

Logging all plays here, whether for the base game, expansion, or both.

One of the best deckbuilding games I've played. With more plays, this may even move into my upper-echelon of deckbuilders along with Dominion, Core Worlds, and Star Realms.

This is actually a pretty-straightforward, basic deckbuilding game, but with a couple of important improvements over other games in the genre.

First is the entomb mechanic and how it relates to end-game scoring. Unlike other deckbuilders where every cards gives you points, you have to "entomb" cards (remove them from your deck with a certain action) and only those cards will score points. Every card has a special ability on it so you have to carefully consider which cards to entomb and when to do it. If I entomb this card now, I'll lose this special ability but it will score points at the end of the game. If I wait, I'll get to use the ability more but I might not have time to entomb the card before the game ends.

The second thing that helps make this game special also ties into the entomb mechanic, but it has to do with thinning your deck. Every turn you can entomb one card from your hand for free. This means that you can be constantly thinning your deck, even without the help of deck-thinning cards. When coupled with some of the other cards that let you take extra entomb actions, you can play this game with a really lean deck, constantly adding new cards and getting rid of old ones.

I've only got a couple of issues. The first is the attack cards. Dominion did it perfectly: the attack cards usually affect all players. In this game you usually get to target a player of your choose, which is problematic. A player can really get behind if hit with repeated attacks. Without those cards or with a more Dominion-style approach, this would be a Dominion-level multiplayer-solitaire game.

Overall, an excellent little game that feels surprisingly fresh even after all of the deckbuilders that have come before.

Small deck builder to take with you, some interesting twist on scoring and I actually do like the reduced art. Setup is fast, table space is minimal and the small box plays 2-4. The only "downside" is that card that forces your opponent to sacrifice a card, that one is outright nasty and in-your-face but other than that a fantastic balance of engine-building and set-collection. The only downsides I would have us that the theme really is pasted on, the card actions and abilities have no connectiin to the theme whatsoever. And the game is quite long for its size. I don't mind the length, as it is fun, but it is no filler game.

Totally shocked by how cool this little game is. I did really enjoy it, I think I like it more than Star Realms as it's not just another last man standing battle card builder nor is it just another point collector.  You have to collect sets to score more and more.  It forces you to cull out those great cards you want the effects for in order to score points to win.  Real though decisions. 

[ImageID=554376]
So you see more and acquire more cards and have a higher end game scores with 2 than with 3 or 4 but really that doesn't seem to matter. Still a challenging game. Great fun.

RATING: 7.5
PROS: •A very compact and self-contained deck building game, with a theme that I really dig into. The mechanics are really well made, and the range of possibilities that the game provides (through not only deck building but also the very way you choose to use each card each turn) turns it into a deeper game and add some replay value.

CONS: •There is some memory factor - even if you are allowed to look at your discard pile when it's not your turn, sometimes you need to rely on memory to know which cards you already got, specially the book set which has similar artwork and the statue set which has 7 different cards - and this sometimes turn the game into a deep introspective match, and most of the times I played this it wasn't exactly a heavy game, but there was a heavy mood of focus present. This may or may not be a con, but when my group played this game then played some others that had higher social interaction and some good laughs due to a lower level of concentration being required, Valley of the Kings turned into Valley of Indifference, which is a pity because I personally love this game, it just has a more serious gameplay, and it's not for everyone.

RATING: 6
Valley of the Kings is a novel deckbuilding game. Cards can be used as money or to trigger their special ability. But it's a couple of other new ideas that really make this game interesting.

First cards are laid out in a pyramid and you can only buy cards from the base of the pyramid, with cards above that card crumbling down to fill the empty spots. This isn't always the case as there are some cards that let you swap the positions of cards, and when a card's ability lets you take something from the pyramid you can take it from anywhere in the pyramid.

Second, this game has interesting mechanisms to take cards out of your hand. You can thin your deck with certain cards that let you put a card in your opponent's scoring pile. Additionally, there are cards that force an opponent to put cards into your discard pile. I don't play a ton of deckbuilding games so I don't really know if this is a new thing, but I hadn't played a deckbuilding game where cards flowed between players quite so much.

Third, and most importantly, you only score points for cards that you "entomb". Entombed cards are removed from your deck and buried in your score pile. So you will often be presented the dilemma of whether to keep a card for it's ability (or spending power) or whether to bury it for points. Most cards are scored as sets, where you square the number of every different card from a set in your tomb. So if you have five different books you get 25 points. Your starting cards are worth a single point each (no sets there) and some of the rarer cards which aren't part of sets are worth more.

Normally you can only entomb one card a turn but there are several cards that let you entomb something as a special action. As the game ends, there is a rush to try and entomb cards to improve your sets.

In my play, I raced to thin my deck, putting a bunch of cards in my opponent's tomb (and thereby giving him some points) which ended up being a little painful as my opponent kept forcing me to give him a card from my hand and I had rid my deck of anything but good cards. I was worried that the combination of giving him a lot of small points early on and him siphoning my hard work and stealing my cards would totally destroy me, but the score was fairly close. I'm already itching to try this game again.

About [thing=150999][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
A deck building game in which trashing (entombing) happens often, is free each turn, and is the whole gist of the game: it isn't a matter of if to trash, but how often, when to start and which cards to put on the tomb.

Timming about when to stop focusing on buying and using cards and shift strongly towards entombing is the key to winning.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
[thing=150999][/thing] uses a pyramid of cards, that works almost like a row of cards ([thing=69789][/thing]), but only the cards in the base of the pyramid are available for purchase, and the cards above "colapse" down once a card in the base is taken.

Cards can be used per its value, to purchase cards, or per its action. There is no limit to the number of actions to be used nor purchases, but values can't be combined to take more cards - value is completely paid for one card (without leftover remaining), before another can be taken.

 Each turn the player is allowed to entomb one card - but several others allow for extra entombing.

Once the game ends, unique cards will give their printed victory points value. Set cards (separated by color) give points accordingly to the number of different cards of them inside the set - the more cards, higher will be the value. Repeated cards in a set have no value and don't form new sets.

The player with the most points will be the winner!

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
- Which cards to buy;
- Which cards to use as action instead of value;
- Which cards to entomb and when to do it.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Smart and dynamic game;
- Good level of interaction (for a deck builder);
- Nice tidbits of historic information in each card;
- Varied effects in the cards, strong tree of interactions between them, and also allowing for a fine amount of replay value, even for a game that always use all the cards in the deck;
- Small, portable and the cards return to the box when sleeved.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Can have downtime issues when playing with 4 (but the historic bits help on this);
- Keeping the cards open in the tomb is a hassle when playing 2p and/or in small tables;
- Copious amounts of shuffling are required.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Learning that dying in a proper manner in Old Egypt is very competitive, more agressive then is good for the health (probably not an issue considering the situation) and sure have some weird needs to match items.

Overall, [thing=150999][/thing] delivers a fine experience, likely a tad too long (it would work better as a 30 minute game, but usually stays around 45-50), but the timming considerations and the shift from buying/using cards to entombing requires a lengthier game to delivers its full experience. Still, it can run into the problem of boring some players. It is basically the same game as the follow up: [thing=175223][/thing]. But I found more interaction in the original, and this made it a little better for me.

In the end, it works well as intended and [thing=150999][/thing] gets a recommendation.

might be heading towards a 9!  4 plays in:  loving it.  i like the starting hand (you start with cards that actually DO something, though basic somethings), card interactions (i still am just figuring out the flow of cards to/from my tomb - some cards i have or can buy early, but are REALLY useful late in the game - so i want to put them away and then pull them out?  will have fun figuring that out.), and love the deck thinning being a default/constant option.  really it is THE POINT.

it can be nasty.  in a four player game, the 'attack cards' can be really useful (aka hurtful).

(2 minute-later edit:  screw it.  just talked myself into making it a nine.)

looking forward to exploring this further.  AND instabuying the expansion.

something like a cross between Dominion and Star Realms.  or something.

Great deck builder, with the addition of entombing you can always streamline your deck, which could be a problem with other deck builders or choice of cards (looking at you dominion without a card for trashing)...anyhow it just feels like it gives you more options on how to keep your deck the way you want, but as points are scored this way their is added weight to your decisions...probably my favorite deck builder. Dominion is fine, it has just gotten so bloated that I lost interest...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
One of the most interesting things about Dominion is deciding when to switch from building your engine to grabbing victory points. Valley of the Kings expounds on this by not only presenting you with the decision of when to strip the good cards out of your deck for points, but how to do it in such a way that you can collect specific sets of them. It's another layer depth for what is becoming a very common (and more or less standardized) genre.

The theme, art and historical flavor text for the artifacts are pretty neat as well. This is well worth checking out if you are a fan of deck builders or even Egyptian archaeology, for that matter.

I didn't really like this to begin with, but still, Dale Of Merchants replaced it. Faster gameplay, more replayability and more balance with a similar take cards out of your deck gameplay.

A neat little deckbuilder with several intereting ideas (card pyramids, removing cards for scoring). If it include less in-your-face cards I would rate it higher.

Addictive and rich in depth. Has fantastic flavor text. Each color has their own strategies and play off each other well, which means you'll want to play it often to experiment with different card types. Plays well with any number of players.

What I love- 
The tension between using a card for its action, as its money value, for entombing it for points, or for manipulating the pyramid to devalue sets your opponent is trying to take.

What I dislike- 
Clever and intelligent opponents using above tactics to devalue my sets.LOL .... Seriously, nothing... it's fantastic, strategic, tactical, quick.... A deckbuilder with the ability to mess with your opponents strategy. Buy and play this game... you won't regret it!

Good solid game, and I like that it is way more self contained than other deck builders.  But, I didn't like it as much as I'd hoped.  (Maybe because I got crushed . . .)

Deckbuilding mit Karten als Kaufwert. Sammeln von gleichen Sets für die Grabkammer. An Dominion angelehnt, doch mit ein paar eigenen Mechanismen.

This is a small-box game that is fantastic for 3 matches!

It is a deckbuilder with two fascinating mechanics:
* crumbling pyramid buying (totally exciting and interesting)
* having good cards in your deck isn't enough.  you also have to get them into your tomb before time runs out!  there is a ton of tension in when to start.

I'd highly recommend it to anyone who is ok with a unique game with limited replayability.

The thing that takes this from an 8 to a 7 is that it forces you to memorize the awkward sounding names of each set card you buy, so you don't accidentally buy it again.

Yet another son of Dominion. In this one you have the concept of entombing, removing a card from your deck for good and having it making points at the end of the game. The nice think is when should you start to entombing useful cards? Nice idea, nice graphics... i am still not perfectly convinced that i truly like this game, something seems amiss but i can't point a finger at it... anyways, rating could raise with time.

This is an excellent game with a fresh take on the deckbuilding mechanic. All of the groups I've tried it with have loved it. It's also delightfully portable and has solitaire rules. The only flaw is that it does contain attack cards (though my groups generally don't bother to use them).

Fast-paced deckbuilder with a thematic preview of the future market. Victory seems to be not "sealed" until the very end. Cards are used for VP and money, great system!

Ancient Eypgtian themed deck builder pocket game.  So many cool evolved mechanics.  I love the cascading pyramid shaped market that not only previews the future market but forces decisions on what cards drop down when a slot is opened after your purchase.  Multi use cards in a deck builder is wonderful. Each card can be stashed for points, used for its special power (e.g. manipulate; the market, your hand, or deck, screw your neighbor), or spent as coin.  Entombing experience points is a wonderful strategy dynamic that allows your deck to continue building without dilution like the olden days.  Entombing cards for points also adds a great timing tension.  When it is time to let go of that powerful card and bury it in the tomb?  The fact that you can only entomb one card per turn adds another layer of tactics depending on the other players.  Another nice touch is the set collection of certain card types.  My only wish is for more card combinations to chew on, maybe expansion?  Plus it is a small footprint big game that is great for travel.  This game reminds me that I respect the original deck builders but can't play them any more.  It's like watching old turner classic black and white movies.  I respect their role in history but they are best left as fond memories.

This is a nice deck building game with a twist,  you need to entomb and lock away most of your cards to earn victory points,  so decks are compact.  There is a bit of text to read on all the cards that made turns drag a bit,  but hopefully it will speed up with more familiarity.

Dominion killer if gossip serves me correctly. Egypt theme, hand-made look and feel, tumbling pyramid system, tiny box, thematic 'entombing' system - it's getting better with each statement...

Interesting entombing mechanic forces players to balance their own card powers against the risk of ending the game with too little in their personal tomb. This third use for each card (play, use for purchasing new cards or entomb for points) creates tension as opponents' actions threaten to prematurely end the game while tombs are still sparse.

A very unique take on deckbuilding where the only way to score points is to remove cards from your hand and entomb them so you can no longer use them.

Can run a bit long for what it is, but still quite enjoyable and you can't beat that portability!

Deckbuilding-Game with a lot of player interaction, very interesting possibilities for hand management, and a lot to keep in mind as players are trying to construct a deck and at the same time deconstruct it into several different discard-piles, only one of which scores points but takes cards away.

Ok little card game that goes on a little too long for what it is. Never seems to get played due to the amount of other options for a deck building game in our collection.

Quick little deckbuilder in which you have to REMOVE cards from your deck in order to score them.  The catch is that unlike Dominion, the best cards are worth the most points.

I love how it's a deckbuilder that requires you to whittle your deck down in order to score. You're constantly having to decide whether to keep a card in the deck because its abilities are *just so good* or if you should entomb it to score. I am always entombing cards a little too late to win... but I always have a good time.

Brilliant game. I love the notion of purposefully removing cards and burying them for points. It causes some of our group to lose their minds as they try to decide to keep or bury a card or cards. Those that refuse to bury lose, but those that get it do quite well. This is one of those games I play a few times since it's so fast and I find fulfilling.

After 2+ Plays: Having to pull out powerful cards to score is an interesting idea, but the rest of the game didn't really grab me.  The pyramid crumbling got to be very annoying, especially considering how little it seemed to matter.

Owned. Punched. Played. Really disliked this. Admire the research and the obvious labour of love involved but all the special rules for different units in deifferent situations wrecked my head. The small hex maps in the East Front series is also one of GMT's worst IMHO. Compounded my error by buying the other 3 in the series (as they were then). Mercifully sold on for a small profit. Hope the buyer enjoyed them.

From Kublacon 2009 for $80.  Need inventory since it is suppose to include the variant coutners.  Long out of print and not on reprint list.  I have been looking for this game for quite a while.

GMT Games.  Very good MONSTER game for the attack on Moscow in 1941.  This is a hex based war game very well designed.  Typhoon is not for the faint hearted.  A good game can easily take 60 - 120 hours to play with a team of players on each side.  Everything is present in the game - weather, artillery, planes, armor, supply, rail conversion, complex terrain.  This game also has a lot of game pieces representing every kind of imaginable combat unit that took part in the battle.  The game is also large and requires an over sized table for game play.

A detailed/rich treatment of the final German push to Moscow, now several games have been added to almost make this the definitive treatment on the Eastern front during WW2

RATING: 7
This is one of two of the best monstergames on the German offensive to take Moscow in late 1941 and perhaps the easiest to play.  That said, it was the first in the GMT Eastern Front Series and needs a bit of updating compared to the sister BARBAROSSA games, particularly with regard to activating Soviet HQ units.  It's nearly impossible to create the kind of pockets at Vyazma and Bryansk that occurred historically without such rules; this is where the other game, MMP's GUDERIAN'S BLITZKRIEG II, does better.  But the logistics model in that game is more detailed than in this one.  

This game trumps both 3Ws SPIRES OF THE KREMLIN and SPI's old OPERATION TYPHOON games in terms of presentation and flexibility, although the latter is faster to play.

Interesting; easy rules, with intriguing turn sequence (soviets first have to move motorized units, then declare and resolve attacks and in the end move infantry units; germans have a plain turn sequence).
Maps are very well done, like all other GMT products.

RATING: 6
A bit out of date compared to the rest of the series, this 1995 Barbarossa Series game is extremely fun to play, very educational and easy to learn with well written rules and on line resources for step by step instruction. The scenarios are a delight as is the map, counters, charts and the sturdy game box.

Update, June 2011.  I'm no longer playing these monster games with complex rules, so I've downgraded this to a five.

Initial rating based on solo play of first scenario.

This is a monster game with hundreds of counters and a 36-page rulebook.  There are alot of rules to digest, and after that, it will take some play to figure out how to effectively employ them.  Like all Vance von Borries games, the rules are clearly made out and make sense.  They tend to be easy to remember after you've played a few turns, and the first scenario doesn't require all of the rules in the book, so you can learn in stages.  

Lately, I've been playing a lot of fast-playing games with simpler rules.  However, this game is really enjoyable, and the situation is very balanced.  The German units are worn out and the Soviet units, although weaker, have decent defensive postions.  Still, the Soviets can't give too much ground as the Germans start very close to Moscow.

Vance von Borris, a wargame design expert on WW2 operational battles, put the Germans pitted against the Soviets in the initial drive towards Moscow.  Great system which was later evolved into the "Eastern Front" system.  Lots of counters and great maps.  Fast play between both sides and the game offers operational insights into the two different armies -- how they fought differently.  Quality of troops, command systems are highlighted. This is an in-depth historical operational level study on the campaign, the eternal experience on the drive towards Moscow.

Best game done on the subject, in my opinion, although the size and complexity will doubtless put many off. Borries has refined the system for his 'Barbarossa' games. Gives some nice insight into the battles in front of Moscow in '41, while still remaining quite playable (for a wargame). I still have not attempted the full campaign, but I'd love to try it. All the maps set up together are more reasonable space-wise than OCS games on the subject, but still a large footprint for those without a real gaming room and a large table.

I think this could have been the best of the EFS games, if only haven't been the first. It's a difficult situation to play well, and its open to many ways of playing, not to metion the fact that the various general orders the german can receive during the game can dramatically change the way the game evolves. The first edition however lacks some of the rules of its later EFS brothers, and needs some counter corrections to be updated to their rules. So, I am eagerly awaiting for the reprint... but in the meantime, if you can find it, it's still one of the greatest wargame ever made.

Great game system have all the games in the series. Counters are top notch maps very good. This one could use a make over, to bring it up to the rest of the series.

Six scenarios plus a great campaign game make this a Russian front classic.  The detail is very good and the fact that you can play it in chunks makes this game manageable.  I do enjoy SPIâ€™s "Operation Typhoon" better than this, mainly for the novelty of it.

This game is punched and slightly clipped doesn't look played. This game is inclded in the Barbarossa series. There are 6 games in the series read the discription of Army Group Center. The entire series is for sale for $700. So if you are interested. I'll contact BBG and figure out how I have to list it for multple items. Maybe list one with a bonus of 5 games. I've already got a super way to pack them. They are close to being ready to ship.All the games are packed in 8mm sleeves I made from Artist's display clear with black back ground sleeves. I just cut & weld them to size. Welding plastic. Find yourself a big old atlas like I did at a flea market or garage sale. Figure out your size cut, The two ends you want 3/32" sticking out of book to run one of those multi burner cigar lighters. Email me if you have any questions. $700 for the lot.

I like the system and this one seems even more fun, the lack of general supply rules in some scenarios is interesting, but you still need attack supply. Moscow seems to close.......

Doesn't take much to update to the latest rules

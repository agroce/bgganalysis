One of the simpler worker placement resource management games.
1) Place workes to get resources (tools).
2) Place workes to turn resources into another kind (use tools to steal valuable items)
3) Place workers to turn in these other resources for victory points (sell valuable items for money)

What makes the game so simple is the absence of "feeding" or cost for using your workers. Their number is fixed and so are the actions. In practice this creates a loop of tedium in which you run in circles performing the same actions over and over again in the same order.

There is not much room for cunning moves or bigger strategies. Just perform the steps 1-2-3 and you're good. The winner will be decided partly by luck if you happen to have the stolen item  in your hand when the price is at the highest for that particular type of loot. 

Anyways, while being simple Langfinger or Sticky Fingers is short at least. And since the game is not broken, it is playable excercise in worker placement.

Version:  Sticky Fingers (aka Langfinger-German), Pegasus Press

Quite charmed by this little filler/family game.  Simple rules with good graphics, very attractive.

Size complaint:
This is almost a good travel game size. The game board is 10" x 7"--perfect travel size, but the box height could easily be cut in half.  Okay if you are traveling by car, but for airfare the box needs to be shorter.  I also need shelf space.  So anytime a game wastes space (no matter how small the dimensions of the box), I get indignant.

On the other hand if you don't use it as a travel game, then it is hard to excuse the very tiny game board that is much too small for 5 people to sit around.  The game board is so attractive, it deserves to be bigger.

RATING: 6.5
With only 2 players I would rate it 6/10, as it becomes less of a mind game, trying to think what tools & loots your opponents are going for. The board could have been a bit larger and perhaps 4 scoundrel tokens each might have been a tad better ?

RATING: 6
Langfinger is worker placement light that plays in under 30 minutes. Players plan and exexute heists and afterwards sell their loot for points.

There are only 5 different actions to choose from with 5 spaces each, and with each player having three pawns to place each round the game is as much about choosing the right actions as it it about timing those actions correctly because placement order is exeution order.

A surprisingly good game for such a small and quick package.

Very portable Worker Placement game, though the box is still too big for the components. I like the theme, however thin it may be, but not the graphics ... would have preferred a 1930's style black and white design, like Black Vienna. Extremely quick and fun with just three.

Very good filler game. Easy to learn and quick to play, but with enough strategy to make it satisfying. The worker placement mechanic works really well. Deciding where to put that first worker is very tricky. The one game I played was very close, and I suspect that most games would be. I think most games will come down to making one extra theft, or being able to make the most advantageous sale in the last round.

RATING: 5
A game in which you place workers to decide turn order in each of the 5 or so separate phases of each round, the goal being to collect tools which allow you to steal items.  Some items then require opening to score points.  Not particularly deep but rather fun.

RATING: 7
Raised to 7 - good for what it is aiming at: a quick condensed worker placement.
------
The small box, mediocre artwork and the less than perfect track record of authors and publisher set the expectations low. But Langfinger is a nice surprise and delivers a crisp worker placement experience in not much more than 30 minutes. It thereby circumvents the biggest drawback of the genre: getting annoyed by the processional nature of going through the placement resolution. It's a bit more luck-based than is usual for the genre but I don't mind it here considering its short length.
Two drawbacks keep it from getting a better rating:
- In a four- or five-player game, the players later in the turn order won't get the chance to get additional cards as all players in front automatically will take the card option.
- Worth of loot cards is secret and differs even for the same input. With equally skilled players luck in getting the higher worth loot cards will often decide the game.

RATING: 7
You probably can’t squeeze a worker placement game into a tighter package – both regarding box size and playing time – and still have something enjoyable left, so it’s very much to the credit of the designers that Langfinger is very enjoyable indeed. The whimsical and colourful illustrations certainly help.

Two design choices turn this from a servicable to a good game, in my opinion. One is the specialty of each player, which adds theme and, more importantly, makes it more worthwhile to ponder the plans of your opponents. The other is the simple, yet efficient differentiation between the two heist localities: one allows you to swap some of your burglar tools beforehand, the other one doesn’t.

All in all, this seems to be a perfect little lightweight game, and especially worthwhile as a travel game.

A cute worker-placement opener/closer/filler type game. With your 3 workers, you place in any of the 5 available areas. The order you place in each area is the order you activate obviously. Once all placed, resolve each area in turn, starting with collecting tool cards, then converting tool cards into point cards (each point card has a toolset requirement you'll need to meet), swap cards for more cards from the the deck, and lastly convert point cards into actual points per conversion cards on display. It's easy to teach and quick to play. There's some tension each turn as you decide where each other player is likely to go and whether you need to dive into this area first because you're likely to get into that other wanted area in a decent position based on what you see people are holding around the table. Classic worker placement, but boiled into a 20-30 minute quickie, which suits the genre well. I liked it.

Little filler that can be played in about 20 minutes. Really easy and not much to it. I might give it one or two more goes and see what I make of it. For now a very unimpressive entry in my collection. It's still enjoyable.

Maybe the best-est, fastest, worker place-iest game there is. 2P games come in around 15-20 minutes.

Probably the world's simplest worker placement game. It fills one of two niches - it can serve as an introduction to worker placement for those not familiar with board games, or as a speedy filler for more experienced players. My mum (who has very little board game experience) had no problem grasping this and immediately wanted a second play. With experienced players, the simplicity and low score threshold mean that while it'll never be a centrepiece of an evening, it can be played in about 15-20 minutes as a fun filler. There aren't many filler worker placement games out there!

Seemed like a very random take on a set collection game.  Surprised I could not find a card list which seems needed to calculate the odds and make better choices.

RATING: 1
Mostly harmless. 

It's the same old worker placement of same old pick resources, turn them into stuff, turn stuff into points. The only good part: you're not building your farm or medieval whathaveyou - you're a thief. And yes, you need tools, these tools turn into a robbery and the stolen merchandise must then be transformed to VPs. The game is simple, the blocking part is effective. Mostly it's about tactics of adapting to current situation. 

Problem: the game plays itself. Decisions were mostly obvious, there's some luck VS risk taking involved, but mostly predictable. 

EDIT: reason this has fallen to 1.0 - depressingly mediocre.

A light worker placement game. Each player has 3 workers (scoundrels) that may be placed in one of 5 locations, each associated with different card types placed there at the start of each round.
- City (tool cards). Collect tools, with earlier placers getting to choose first.
- Villa, or Museum (loot cards). Take loot, most of which require a specific combination of tools to turn into cash at the Harbor. Earlier placers get to choose their loot first.
- Harbor (fence cards). Fence one loot (or 2 of one type), assuming the matching fence card is present (earlier to place worker chooses first).
- Ruins (tool cards; no cards placed; instead, discard and draw from deck). Exchange tools, with earlier placers getting more favorable trade ratios.

Starting player rotates each round. Last round triggered when someone has more than 20 cash (VP); player/s with most VP win(s)!

RATING: 7.5
This game is the very essence of "less is more".  Incredibly minimalistic rules that drive some fun choices.  Nothing too tough, but occasionally you've got a decision to make that really matters.  The short play  time really helps distill this one down to a lot of fun in a small package.  

We were surprised at how well this played for 2.  I'm actually really excited to try it with more but it worked fine at that number.

*********EDIT************

Much better with 3 than with 2.  Light, fast, and fun.  This is a terrific gateway game.

小偷游戏

將遊戲圖板放在桌面中央。 
玩家各取某色的竊匪牌、竊匪棋子及3個行動木粒。將竊匪棋子放在遊戲圖板左下角數字0的位置上。 
將工具牌、財物牌、買家牌，分别覆轉洗混，疊放在遊戲圖板側備用。每個牌疊側預留位置作棄牌堆。一旦遊戲中某牌疊耗盡，即將該種棄牌重新洗混重用。 
由擁有最修長手指的玩家成為起始玩家，並持有起始玩家牌。 
由起始玩家開始，依順時針方向，玩家輪流抽取工具牌作手牌。起始玩家抽2張牌；第二位玩家抽3張牌；其他位玩家各抽4張牌。
遊戲進行 
遊戲以回合進行。在每一回合中，玩家即依次執行以下3個步驟。

1. 揀選行動 
由起始玩家開始，依順時針方向，玩家輪流將1個行動木粒，放到遊戲圖板上的5處地方。這步驟會持續至各人皆已放上3個行動木粒。 
玩家擺放行動木粒時，必須優先佔據編號較小的位置。 
遊戲圖板上每處地方，最多可容納5個行動木粒。同一玩家的行動木粒，可先後放到同一地方處。

2. 執行行動 
按地方編號由小至大，逐一執行該地方的功能。玩家行使地方的功能，則是按行動木粒的排列次序。佔較小編號者先行，佔較大編號者隨後。 
玩家執行該地方的功能後，即收回自己的行動木粒。 
例：每回合必定先執行1號市區的功能。當所有玩家收回放在這處的行動木粒後，才會執行2號别墅的功能；如此類推。
1號市區 
玩家拿取排列在這處的2張工具牌，加入自己的手牌之中。 
若輪至玩家時此處已無工具牌，玩家即一無所得。

2號别墅 
按財物牌牌背所示的工具圖案，玩家必須打出指定的工具牌，才可拿取該財物牌。 
玩家打出的工具牌即成棄牌。 
玩家取得的財物牌若是寶箱，即按寶箱上價目牌的數字，前進其竊匪棋子相同的步數，然後丟棄這張寶箱財物牌。 
玩家若取得其他的財物牌，即牌面向下放在自己面前桌面。

玩家的竊匪牌各具專長。每回合玩家在2號别墅中，可少付1張竊匪牌上所示的工具牌一次。

3號棄置場 
玩家將自己的行動木粒移放到5個交換處之一。按該交換處所示，玩家丟棄指定數目的工具牌後，再抽取指定數目的工具牌。 
玩家不可揀選已被行動木粒佔據的交換處。 
所有玩家皆執行這地方的功能後，才各自收回自己的行動木粒。

4號博物館 
如同2號别墅一般，玩家打出指定的工具牌，即可取得合適的財物牌。 
玩家同樣可在此處使用其竊匪牌的專長。每回合玩家在4號博物館中，可少付1張竊匪牌上所示的工具牌一次。

5號碼頭 
玩家按自己面前桌面的財物牌，揀選1張合適的買家牌，出售1種財物牌。 
買家牌上的圖案代表其收購的種類。若同一圖案有2個，玩家即可同時出售2張該種的財物牌。 
每個行動中玩家只限出售1種的財物牌。

玩家公開出售的財物牌，按物件上價目牌的數字，前進其竊匪棋子相同的步數，然後丟棄出售財物牌、及其揀選的買家牌。 
買家牌的收購圖案旁，若有+1或+2的價目牌，即代表出售的財物牌價格提高，玩家的竊匪棋子會多走1或2步。

3. 回合總結 
如同「圖板設置」，為各地方補回足夠的卡牌。 
起始玩家將起始玩家牌，傳予其左方玩家。由新的起始玩家開始下一回合。

遊戲結束 
一旦有玩家的竊匪棋子，抵達(或超越)數字20的位置，這回合結束時，遊戲亦即結束。 
玩家的竊匪棋子超越數字20的位置時，可將棋子平放以示多於20。 遊戲結束後，竊匪棋子跑得最遠者勝。同分即作平手論。

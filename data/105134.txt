The modifiable board is ingenious, but in the end, it's still Risk. There is a lot of great fun to be had with the unique rules and components added in this version of the classic game, but for me personally, I was hoping for a changed combat system. Throwing a pinch of dice for hours to slowly pick away an opponent's army is arduous and unappetizing, especially when one of the factions has a vorpal chance that only seems to activate when you're playing against it!! Overall, very fun game with good replayability, but only if you enjoy the structure of Risk battles.

This ****-ing game.  This is the best experience with Risk you will ever have.  Simple enough that a non-gamer can pick it up (if they start at the beginning), and grows in complexity with the user.  Can't recommend it enough.

RATING: 4
Signed up for this with my group.  Whoops.  Fast, random, non-thematic exercise in set collection - Rummy with dice.  Armies pop out of nowhere and streak across the globe every single turn, meaning troop numbers, continents, and reinforcements are completely irrelevant.  Park and wait until you have enough cards, then make a run for it and hope for the best.  Seen it 3/3 plays now, including my win.

The group's defense is that it's worth playing because it is shorter than regular Risk.  Honestly. I doubt, because our group does not have terrible taste, that we'll get too far into the stickers and extra rules, which would take extra time to resolve and thus negate the only good thing about this game.

Update:  I was correct about the group.

RATING: 5
There are a few rules that makes the game better than normal RISK, and a few that makes it worse. As the game progresses and you begin 'shaping' the world, the risk of things getting even more unbalanced than in normal RISK is pretty high.

Just started playing this with friends; from the first game, this is an 8, easy: it made me giddy, it was tense, it was tricky. As the Great War proceeds, this rating might change. (How do you rate such a path-dependent game anyway?)

Edit: after the last sessions, upgraded to a preliminary 10. (!) Brilliant design. 
Edit: Five games in. The board is drenched in anecdotes and steamy history. Can't I rate this an 11? Pleaaaase?
Edit: Seven games in, and the last one draaaaagged greatly. Still thrilling, but there is a sense that this might jump the shark at some point. I hope I am wrong. At any rate, I do no longer wish to rate this an 11. (praising with faint damnation)
Edit: well well. After some lackluster experiences, I see the general fault lines in the design, the way it breaks and the way groupthink can make for a very disappointing experience - and the game facilitates this. So, down to a 9 at this point. (Still high, yea)

RATING: 4
Heaven help me, someone in my gaming group bought a Risk game.  Please let this not be sheer torture.

Update:  Five games played.  The evolving mechanics are neat, and cracking those sealed bins open yielded fun surprises.  However, the core game experience is still Risk, which still makes me want to pound my face into the table.  I'm giving this a 4 because, while I don't want to play it, I can be talked into it with begging and/or bribery.

(Not actually mine, but lives on my shelf)

It's still Risk, but the presentation and narrative conceits are SO wildly original and entertaining that it doesn't matter. The sealed envelopes, factions, and evolving board really makes the game carry gravitas and meaning. LOVE.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.8
Incredibly innovative (deserves a 10 for that), evolving board draws you into constantly wanting to play 'just one more.' Luck and randomness is a potential negative; the best made strategies can fail on that count. But rewards those quick to adapt and respond to changes in the balance of power. A pleasant surprise was how late into the campaign we could introduce new players and still have a reasonably balanced experience: our play group at the 16th game had only two players who had started earlier than game 7; one started as late as game 12. Would love to see more games that make use of the 'legacy' mechanic.

Risk Legacy improves upon many its predecessor's faults such as game length, strategy, and randomness. The game is best enjoyed with a static gaming group that treats the game as a fun, collaborative experience and not a serious strategy game. 

As a game designer, I am very grateful that Rob & Chris were brave enough to break traditional gaming conventions to inspire a new generation of board game experiences. Thank you, best of luck to your future endeavors!

One of the best game experiences I had! Starts out more or less as Risk but becomes so much more when you play! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
First of the Legacy games.  You probably have played Risk, probably grew up playing.  This game takes an old and tired concept and significantly freshens up to a very fun experience.  There a few issues you must consider first.

1 - It is a legacy game.  You will play up to 15 games and you will rip up cards, write on the board, and place stickers.  It really is not worth playing once the campaign is over.  I have no problem with that because I look at the game overall entertainment value.  I paid $45 for probably 25 hours of gameplay, enjoying it all the while.  I'll take that $2/hour any day.  

2 -- The game can be a little unbalanced when some one gets out in front.  The catch up mechanism is not great.

3 -- The game rewards aggressive play that can end a particular game suddenly.  One minute the game seems even and the next minute it is over.  

Otherwise, highly recommended!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.75
The sense of excitement this game gives you is like no other.  Ripping up the cards is such a forbidden thrill, and writing on the game board makes your memories with this game permanent.  The mechanics are a big improvement on classic Risk, as well.  For example, if one part of the board is always a pain in the neck for your table, you can do various things to weaken (or strengthen) its defensive capabilities. That said, it's still Risk, and with a varied collection I find that other games are still more appealing even with the siren call of those sealed packages.

1st set of play: Much better than I expected. It's a lot like classic Risk but with enough variation between games, "achievements" to unlock and a sense of progression from game to game.

We had to employ a change to the setup to balance things, but that was done easily, and I look forward to our next game.

2nd plays: The game continues to evolve and having a lot of fun with the system. 15 plays seems like a lot but haven't tired of it yet.

Risk sucks on a fundamental level, but this is the best version I have ever played. You can see how they knew it would be better when the legacy concepts added to an already great game like Pandemic.

Suffers from the same problem that Risk usually does: Best-made plans undone by crappy dice rolls. But it doesn't outstay its welcome and offers a load of fun in the much-shorter playing time together with the truly innovative evolving board state so it gets an unqualified thumbs up.

RATING: 9
Woah - this is a fantastic game. I never thought I'd say that about Risk. Each game's paced just right. The strategic choices are interesting. The light diplomacy is meaningful. The scars and stickers, while not changing the game much, adds impressive amounts of flavour to an otherwise dry war game. Opening the packs has always been exciting and there are several more I hope to see before our campaign ends. The only complaint is the narration is kind of hokey, but it's a minor nitpick because the game knows what it is and tries to have a sense of humour about it.

Finished game 12 of 15: This game is amazing. One of my two jaw dropping moments in board gaming (the other being in TIME Stories).

This game was an amazing event. All of us that played contributed an even amount of money to buy the game which I think was 20$. This game gave us I think 9 nights of amazing fun (so clearly well worth the money) and the winner was able to keep the game. It was a great excuse for a bunch of us to get together and have an absolute blast. It did take us over 6 months to finish as life and schedules made it difficult to get the same group of people together for all 15 games. P.S. We opened the do not open envelope.

WOw!!

Estoy sorprendido con la idea, es totalmente una experiencia muy diferente y genial, para ser un juego de hasbro.

Siendo un juego de risk no aburre (no es monótono) para nada, me gusta la idea de habilidades especiales en las facciones y demás efectos que afectan al juego. Aunque los jugadores lo modifican a su antojo creo que no queda demasiado des-balanceado, ese pretexto es para los que no son estrategas, y lo quieran todo muy fácil (me han tocado veces en donde hasta el mas débil tubo la oportunidad le gano a los mas fuertes).

Lo mejor de todo, es que te deja con la intriga sobre que sucederá en los siguientes juegos (por lo menos esto aplica en las primeras 15 partidas)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Amazing idea of an evolving game board and is great if you get a group together that plays everything together.

I came in and played game 8 and game 15 in the group and felt a bit out of place.

Pros - Drafting Mechanism, Dynamic/Living Board, Unique Groups with skills.  
Cons - It's still Risk.  

However, in the end, it still is a game of risk and that is where it gets knocked off a few points because fundamentally the core game play is frankly tired and old.  You're rolling dice and fundamentally tied to the success of those die rolls.

We had a fantastic time playing the 15 games of this innovative game, making the changes, revealing the new aspects of the game, developing our favorite factions... It was a bittersweet moment when we finished. One of our friends had won the most games, so he got to keep the board, and is assembling a display with it, which should be cool to see when it's done.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
It is risk. The legacy novelty wears off quickly. The game is not much fun when you know you are going to lose, but it takes a while to be finished off. Attacking just weakens you and leaves you exposed to counter attack, bad luck on the dice rolls is fatal, skill is not rewarded. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Can't wait to get this played. This is the next evolution in game design I'm sure of it.

Date set for 28th October - Start of the campaign.

Played through five games and WOW!
This is new and different. Ignore the people who say "How can you destroy cards!?" as you are not destroying a card but creating a new world each time you play.

We have opened three packets so far: Sign twice, all minor cities, and 3 missiles used on one combat. 

Game six is going to be very different to the other because of what happened at the end of the last game.
Beware the Saharans!

Well Game 6 threw in a huge surprise and the Saharans are now uber sneaky! 

We have now finished 10 games and all the main packets are opened. The fight for the placement of the world capital was interesting and could have gone to several players.

 Only the Do NOT open. Ever. packet remains. I'm pretty sure someone is going to open this after game 15.

I'm lucky to have played this with the same group all the way through. I urge anyone getting it to do the same as your world will develop a history of its own.

Do NOT open was opened before game 15. eeep!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Still has issues that made classic Risk a mediocre game, but adds the fun of customizing factions with special abilities and customizing the board with personally named cities and continents. Extra incentive to win games because it is recorded right there on the board and allows you to customize the board to help you in future games.

Each game doesn't tie in as critically with previous games as I was expecting, which is both good because the same core of players don't necessarily need to play together and bad because I thought that was the point of the game.

Never thought I could have this much fun with Risk.  Absolutely brilliant.

Edit after 13 plays:  Probably the best $50 I've ever spent.  The game is just plain fun, and unlocking stuff has elicited it's fair share of "oh my God!"-styled responses.  Can't wait to play it again.

This game is brilliant, and turns Risk into something respectable while also bringing brilliant innovations in its own right. A couple problems - tying certain rewards to particular players makes this game basically *require* a constant game group. The game spoilers and increasingly complex rules don't help matters, but I don't think I'll be able to finish the "campaign" of my first copy. But this game is a 9 for a reason - once you've got a group of players, you'll just have a blast with this game's narrative, brutal play.

This game is more important than it is good. Everything that is good about it comes from the introduction of Legacy mechanics, and its almost a shame its saddled to the very rudimentary area control of Risk. Regardless, the campaign is a helluva ride and Seafall should easily deliver on the promise of this game. Everyone should try this, however.

Stickers and tearing things up. I am a huge Risk fan in general, including all of its myriad of versions, but this one by far takes the cake. The only problem with it is that it really plays best at the full 5, and you REALLY want to get the same 5 people together for 15 games of Risk.

RATING: 8.5
Risk with a twist. The game itself is excellent thanks to the Legacy system and a lot of fun. If people concentrate on retaking their lost territories instead of moving forward, it can devolve into a game that outstays its welcome but if people keep pushing, the game can be played in as low as 30 minutes with 5 people. 

Thanks to the Legacy system, the simple combat mechanic slowly gets more and more modifiers, either in the form of nuclear rockets for the winners of previous games or modifiers present on the board or faction abilities. 

It's a very simple game which evolves and gets a bit more complex with every new game, but thanks to the fact it can be played quickly (unlike regular Risk) and simple rules, it's a great family game. People who are expecting a serious strategy or wargame or simply hate Risk, might be disappointed. But those who can look beyond the limitations of the basic Risk mechanics, will find a lot of fun here, with lots of twists and surprises along the way. It's all about the Legacy and creating your own, one of a kind, version of Risk. No wonder it started the new Legacy trend in boardgaming.

I like the part were the board and the rules evolve over time. I don't like that they did it again: This new version of Risk does play faster than the latest, watered down, versions of Risk. One game lasts 30-45 minutes now.
In all of the games I played the game was won because of a lucky die roll in the first round. If your neighbor decides against you in the first round, it's often game over for you. I'm also not a fan of the new setup method (tip: take Australia, it's by far the best starting position - of yourse you can only select it if your were lucky in the dice roll before).

Update: Alas, it's been a month since our "first 15" and I feel no great hankering to get it back on the table. In retrospect, the gameplay wasn't particularly great - just greater than any other version of Risk. The most exciting part of the game was the reveal of new stuff, and the customization of the game. And while that was fun, it makes me reconsider my initial rating. If everything about the game were as exciting as those parts, it would deserve an 8.

Original: Will easily jump to 9 if the fun level remains high after the first fifteen plays. If this fun can be experienced by players other than the five who are playing the campaign, this is a 10.

I LOVE THIS GAME! I was really excited to get this game, but when we played it 4 times in one night, we realized it's amazing and literally one of the best games I have ever played! :)

Edit: After more plays I have lowered my rating from a 10 to a 9.5 because it is not in fact the greatest game ever although it will always be loved by me and my friends. 

Second Edit: Lowered rating again because it is just so difficult to get the same people together to play this game. Works if you have a small, consistent group to game with, I have a large, inconsistent group that I game with so we can never get the original 5 together to play again. It's lame.  

EDIT: lowered my rating to a 6.8 because after we played about 11 games of this and opened all the stuff, we stopped playing. At that point one person had won too much and he had like 5 missles.

*SPOILERS*

This game encourages you to build up big armies before attacking and conquering enemy territories and HQs. So I did just that - and here's what happened:

I traded in cards for a HUGE number of armies and placed them all in one territory. It was very evident that I was going to win on that turn, and began conquering my neighbors. On a whim, simply to open a box, another player decided to play a missile in a battle he was not involved in on one of my dice that had NO effect on anything. Because he did this, he got to decide where a nuclear bomb went off - wiping out ALL armies in that territory. Of course, he wiped out mine. And I lost the game. That is broken - and downright stupid. An entire game, that would have ended on that turn, was reversed because of a random event card revealed on the whim of another player.

One of the first things you do in Risk Legacy is choose one of two powers to give your faction -- and then you take the other one and rip it into pieces. The finality of every choice in Risk Legacy is a complete thrill, and unlike anything I've ever experienced in gaming before. Cities, scars, secret compartments, game changing, holy $*@# moments... The whole thing is a beautiful mess of unbalancing additions, and it's left to the players to rebalance or at least negotiate it as best they can. Australia too turtley? Scar the continent until it's an uninhabitable wasteland. No one wants a land war in Asia? Stack its territories with coins to make it too good to pass up. Oh, it's just SO GOOD. Screw all the whiners who can't bear to tear up a card -- if you're not doing it permanently, you're not doing it right!

As good a version of Risk as you are going to find. Reasonable win condition makes the games go quickly, and thus you get to see the evolution of the board and cards. That part is so cool and innovative. Adds a sense of permanence. But, in the end, its Risk. So, you put the game a way and play something you like better.

I don't think I have ever been this excited about playing Risk.  

Update:  Now that I've played it my excitement was justified.  Perhaps because I haven't played any of the other versions of Risk since the original version I felt that it wasn't a good game.  This version is great!  How it's set up now, it doesn't take very long.  The dice are still the dice and it's still Risk but the streamlining of it works well.

This particular game, with adding the cities and resources is way cool and added a point, easily, on my rating.  Asia is the hot spot in our world.  Lots of resources for the taking out there.  We now have a couple of major cities on the board (we played two games) and talk is already circling about how to stop the winners from grabbing their spots.  We talked a ton after the second game about what could have or should have happened.  If people didn't have to leave, we would have played a third time in one day.

The rating is tricky on this one. I'm going outside of the recommended use of them, as I'll probably never play it again (and I'm definitely ok with that). But I loved it.

That being said, wow. This game has made some of my best gaming memories. So much fun to watch the board change after each game, to see the evolving strategies of the players and the piling on as anyone started inching ahead. Naming cities, continents, placing scars on others, making factions better or worse, making more events happen and hoping to benefit from them and not be punished by riots... Awesome.

Very much looking forward to future games with legacy features. It was wild (and felt a little strange) to be writing on the board and tearing up cards. Easily worth the 10 bucks we all pitched in for the board. My only complaints were that it was difficult to coordinate the schedules of 5 people to get the whole group together to play, and that it's Risk. We finished 1.5 weeks before everyone was moving away, and we had about 2 years to get all of the games in; it was stressful to try and make that work. I like that most of my other games can be played with anyone. Re: problem two, Risk is fun on occasion, and this game made it much more fun than normal. But none of us feel like we need to get more Risk in our lives, and probably will be ok to never play again.

I'm a fan of Risk (as long as the dice are rolling right) and so is my oldest. I bought this for him for Christmas, and the whole family plays. It very interesting how the game changes with each play. The factions are a nice addition to basic Risk, each with unique abilities that can change as you progress through a series of plays. 

Everyone in my family has won at least once, from age 8 to us parents. I think we have played maybe 8 times so far, and I've only won once, but strategy isn't my strong point. The kids love signing the board and naming things like cities and regions.

Not my favourite risk (Star Wars takes that spot) but not bad (if you like risk), clever "change the game as you play" mechanic so it develops.

Downside is it needs a stable group of players so you all play through all the scenarios, rather than a game you can mix up with different groups.

Overall, quite like it - and would commit to playing through the whole thing with the right group.

I have mixed feelings about this. I really loved the idea of a legacy game and this was my first foray into that genre. While regular Risk is (at this point) boring to me, this offered up enough variety and potential for change that I was excited to try it out. Having played (to this point) 11 games, it's okay, but there's a definite sense of apathy to this point from some in the group, in just wanting to finish out the game. Legacy games can be fun, but the time commitment needed to one game (multiple playthroughs) can cause an otherwise fun game to lose it's luster over a non-legacy version. I'm glad I've played this game. I don't know if I'll be interested in playing it again for quite a while.

Unlike anything.

This game stands on it's own for originality.  I'm sure there are many who will decry this as a marketing ploy - even if so, it is a brilliant one.  I don't share the view that this is the case however, I prefer to think of this game as a breath of fresh air, an experience that stands to grow and develop with the players that experience it.  As an experience this game stands apart, a brilliant and daring design - well done Rob and Chris, well done.

As a version of Risk this game is well done, the short term goals of playing to 4 stars makes the game fast paced and aggressive.  The rules are solid.

This solid game play combined with the original and immersive narrative experience rising from the changing game makes for an excellent game.  Can't wait for the next session.

I have played a lot of [b]Risk[/b].  Of course, that was long before I discovered hobby gaming.  I still have a soft spot for [i]Risk[/i], but I no longer have the desire to play the 3-4 hour epic games I used to enjoy.

[b]Risk Legacy[/b] is a lot like the old epic games of [i]Risk[/i], except it's broken into 15 1-2 hour segments. It's really fantastic. You literally physically change the board as you play, even destroying some of the components as it is played.  That might sound intimidating for players who like to keep their games as pristine as possible, but for me, a well worn out game is a well played game.

Notwithstanding, this game does require a certain type of player. After 15 plays, the player with the most wins gets to name the board. And in my play group, everybody wanted to be the one to name the board.  Therefore there was a lot of deals made to insure no player had too many wins.  After our 15 games, we even had to use the tie breaker to determine who named the planet. Some of us purposely lost some games to insure no player won too many times.  And unfortunately, we never opened "30 armies plus a missle".  The side deals broke the game. 

I also think playing with 5 players was too many. We were immediately attacking each other, and the game felt shortened because we made our points primarily by capturing HQs. 

I personally decided that I will not open the last envelope. Instead, I plan to buy a new copy of [b]Risk Legacy[/b].  Next time, I will find 3 other players who will not, under any circumstances, make any deals, and will play each game to win.

What a brilliant conceit: make a game that tells its own history, recording every game you've ever played right on its board and cards. I love the concept, love the awesome minis, love the outrageousness and ridiculousness of it all (I refuse to open the forbidden pouch).

However, in the end, it's still Risk. I don't mind the dice rolling, and I think that the fun of Risk has always been more in the negotiation and diplomacy among players, making alliances and convincing others to leave you alone. I just don't know if I'm interested in playing a 3+ hour dice-roller more than a couple times a year (and multiple 3+ hour games to get the full Legacy experience).

I own 800+ board games, have been playing them for 35 years, and am becoming a little jaded about new games and new fads.

But I am telling you right now that there is something special about Risk: Legacy.

Legacy is the perfect name for the game.  It's your group's legacy - the game that's created by your choices and actions.

Fun.  FUN.  F-U-N.

UPDATE:  Some of the most fun moments in board gaming ever.

Legacy introduces so many conceptual news that you cannot avoid to play this game. I advice to buy a "martyr" copy with your gaming group and a copy for yourself if you are a collector. It does not make sense to sacrifice the main qualities of this game by proxing parts and by spoilering locked components in the box.

EDIT: We finished our campaign. Some king making issues due to legal but dangerous choices. Definetly one of the factions became the power creep. We self-moderated our choices in such a way to open remaining boxes.
We finished with a terrible tie braker by an embarassing dice throw.

Probably the last UPDATE: We just opened the "3 Missiles" pack, which was a pretty cool game-changer. I was thinking I might be pretty close to being done, but the new stuff got me engaged again. Despite its flaws I've been enjoying it and will continue to play for a little bit anyway. Still, there are some rather obvious ways the game could have been made better.

Here is what I wish about Risk: Legacy.

I wish they hadn't screwed with the early game. This is probably the biggest mechanical problem with the game. The new "place a base and expand" is vastly inferior to classic "fill up the map with pieces and then fight" rules. Australia and South America become crazy powerful, with our first 4 games won out of Australia and the rest out of South America until both were utterly nerfed by the -1, nukes, and new sea connections. Because of the way scoring works, early games are likely to be short, but as the plot develops games can go longer than classic Risk in much less satisfactory ways, as initial base placement can be destiny barring good luck out of the Event deck. Unlike classic Risk, it actually can be quite hard to drive Risk: Legacy to conclusion because of the respawn rules, attrition through the Event deck, and the fact that some missions can be almost impossible and can gum up that deck.

I wish they had done more with more subtle parameterization and less with heavyweight rules. The rulebook is terrible to begin with, then when you layer on all the complexities from the various reveals and paste in all the rules add-ons, it gets a bit crazy. Risk wants to be a simple push-your luck game, but you could still do so much just by really developing a couple of the ideas instead of including everything you can think of. Plus, we had several significant rules questions which were not clearly answered in the rules (frustratingly, "conquest" is never defined despite frequent usage - does expanding into an area count as conquering? I think not, but it's just not totally clear).

I wish the reveals had been paced with more attention to detail. We went through boom and bust, with customizations coming in big spurts then petering out for several games. The scars are particularly frustrating - they are metered out very poorly.

I wish the backstory had been real. It could have been even more engaging if the reveals had been more than random stuff happening, if you could anticipate things a little bit instead of just seeing what happens. Anticipation breeds hope and fear, the lifeblood of narrative. Random stuff happening does not.

Still, despite all these rather obvious ways in which the game could be improved, Risk: Legacy is still fun and basically works and is an experience. I've enjoyed it quite a bit, actually. It's just so easy to wish it had been better.
---
6 games into the campaign, and I'm still enjoying it. But, it's not that well-paced. We're now out of cities to add, so we're just adding coins to cards after each game, which doesn't feel terribly interesting (the winner gets a little more flexibility, but not exactly a ton). We ran out of scars back in game 2 and haven't got any new ones. This game could have been really great. It's fun, but not all that it easily could have been.
---
I've enjoyed this quite a bit, and it's a terrific concept, but I can't escape the feeling of the traditional Hasbro lack of development. The rules are terrible (especially since classic Risk has great "inside of the box lid" rules). The new starting rules (dump a bunch of guys in a province and spread out) I think has the unfortunate issue of eliminating a nice development phase that classic Risk has, instead going direct to high-stakes conflict with everyone at each others' jugular and someone probably being effectively eliminated within 5-10 minutes of starting, and the first person to take and hold a continent (Australia until it gets nerfed) is going to win. Seriously, before everyone wins once, make sure a -1 sticker is on Australia and for the love of God don't put any extra coins there.

The thing which makes me nervous though is the uneven pacing and reveal of the packets, with the game world evolving only in fits and starts. You run out of scars after only one game, then our first packet was the "9 cities" one which got opened after game 4. It changes up the game significantly, but it's sort of random and fails to generate any thematic coherence. It would have been much more interesting to give the opening of packets and flow of the game some narrative drive. We'll see, we're still early in the reveals, so it might pick up, but the lack of any narrative cohesion so far is a little unfortunate. Risk is an old game, Risk Legacy is being sold in hobbyist channels, it needs to do something to grab you. It doesn't help that the backstory they came up with (if we can even call it that) of multiple cloned earths is totally idiotic.

But, I'm keeping my 9 rating. We've played it 4 times, it's generally been fun, and it plays quickly. I wish the reveals were paced better, with more, smaller injections of interest to keep you hooked, but for now I'm still coming back.

Last thing, this must have been a significant manufacturing challenge - I think the big obstacle to more people expanding on this idea is simply the difficulties of doing the customized collation and packaging. The idea of doing things with stickers is clearly key, but those must have been something of a production challenge also. I wonder if the significant amount of effort spent on the production angle meant less attention to the game design and narrative than perhaps was needed.
---
This didn't really sink in until after I played this again, but: with all the customization available, you can do sort of fix Risk's balance issues: you can nerf Australia! You can make Asia worth fighting over by adding coins to the cards. You can create interesting hotspots. I wish the rules had emphasized a little bit more the "collaborative game design" aspect of the customization. It's not just a layer of meta-game, and it's best if you don't think of it that way. It's a way for the group to collaboratively design a game to their collective taste.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
While the game is still pretty much just Risk (especially at the beginning), you can't deny the coolness factor of a game that evolves as you play it.

I almost feel as if I alter my play style in order to make it most likely that an envelope will get opened rather than trying to win though, as the fun is really in the mystery of those darn sealed envelopes!  So perhaps Risk Legacy is much more about the experience than the game, and in this case, that's perfectly ok.

My favorite version of Risk.  It can be confusing sometimes to keep track of the changing rules, especially since I play with my kids and am trying to keep track of everyone's individual special ability on my own.

Being able to change and write on the board has been a blast for the kids.  I think they enjoy naming the cities more than anything else.  Winning really means something too, as it determines who gets to name what.

Better with more people. Much of our group didn't like the missles. Play house rules now, removed all stickers and put them on poker chips, randomize cities at start of game and use removable stickers to place so many of each coin value on countries. world capital is always a 6. wrote all the strengths and weaknesses on different colored index cards. Still do the draft but now we roll first to see who gets world capital. If you roll high you can take it or not. If you take it you automatically get leftovers in draft. However you have to set a timer from 5-60 minutes on game start and thats the nuke timer, timer goes off you immediately draw next card and that acts as nuke target, you can opt out of that target to take the next target (and hope it not yourself). after draft everyone picks 1 strength and 1 weakness or you can take 2 if you take 2 of each. Also the brown missle powers we turned into 1 a game powers and added many many more (world leader also gets 2 powers). Finally we have a deck of cards that are rules that apply to everyone and 1 gets picked at random at the end of setup. Still play to 4 victory points. games end within a few hours. but are pretty hectic and everyone has good time. everyone picks 2 scars/blanks/ruins also. only downside to playing is the dice of course.

I'm LOVING this, and I'm not even a big fan of the original Risk.

From the moment I opened the box and read the 'contract' for all the players to sign, acknowledging responsibility for the war to come, I've been hugely impressed by the attention to detail and sense of humour evinced by the creators of this game.

The secret envelopes create a real feeling of anticipation, and the chance to personalise the board is a big added incentive to fight for a win or just to hold on until the bitter end.

At first I was disappointed that I wouldn't get to play as the same faction all the time, but now I can see that being obliged to switch tactics from game to game to play to a given faction's strengths will make the campaign all the more interesting.

We introduced this to a very uncompetitive girly social gamer and even she really liked it.

NO SPOILERS!
I finally got to play Risk Legacy after having tried to make arrangements with 3 friends and my brother for the past year! I play a lot with this group so I was a little afraid that some would be pissed, but we all agreed that no matter what happened we wouldn’t be too mad – after all, it’s just a game! We managed to finish 3 games (with 3 different winners), and it was awesome! I don’t like Risk as it always overstays its welcome, but Risk Legacy is a very quick game (though I imagine later games will take more than an hour, perhaps two, but that’s still shorter than regular Risk). The other good thing about Risk Legacy is that the game ends as soon as somebody gets 4 VP, and it means that nobody ever sits around too long waiting for the game to end. I know that later there will be missions and events, but I have no clue about how those are going to change the game – all I know is that I cannot wait to open all of the packages!

And while it’s an awesome idea that you open new packages and add new rules and components and rip stuff apart and write on the main board to form your own world, I’m fairly sure that after we’re done with the 15 games, it’s not a game that is that fun to play again… It’s all about the experience and excitement of open new packages and not knowing what will happen! This is also a problem with another new game, Legends of Andor, which I think is great the first time you play a scenario but then becomes very uninteresting. Sure, LoA is more scripted than Risk Legacy, but a lot of the excitement will disappear. 

I’m not sure if I like the diplomatic aspect of Risk Legacy; like regular Risk, you need to convince the others that you’re not a threat and they should attack the other players instead… Still, as you know that the overall winner is the one who has won the most after 15 games, you will most likely attack those who have won most games so far. Also, I like that players who haven’t won start the game with 2 VPs while the winners only start with 1! It really helps to level out the playing field.

Another thing I don't fancy is the fact that there is a right player-binding; meaning that if a player suddenly decides to go all in (and this will happen), the next player will benefit tremendously if the original player does not succeed in winning the game. After 10 plays it has happened 3 or so times (most of the other times the player who went all in usually won).

Again, no spoilers: After 10 plays, a lot of the packs have been opened and they change the game dramatically - and it's a huge bonus to the game in my opinion! It is what makes this version of Risk superior to all other versions.

Overall, my rating of Risk Legacy isn’t a rating which is totally tied to the game itself. It’s also partly because of my gaming group which helps this game come to life and helps evoking a great experience! There’s a lot of trash talking etc. – just like a game like this should be!

I think this game is great with its innovative campaign mode. This is my favorite of the Risk titles, and I like that it's not as long to play, but I still am not a fan of lots of dice rolling. There's also traces of "king making in this game." It's still somewhat entertaining for every once and awhile. So, yeah...

RATING: 7
Rated 7 after three consecutive plays. I was very intrigued to try this game. The idea of opening envelopes triggered by events, writing on the board, tearing up cards... I thought it might provide a nice refreshing perspective to gaming. So, our gaming group gathered a bunch of people, we all ponied up $5 each, and we bought this sucker.

Having played three games in a row, I have to say I'm fairly pleased. I never played Risk growing up (!!), so a game of "dudes on a map" is something new for me. This is not Euro-gaming. This is direct conflict and wild swings of luck with the die rolls. It took a bit of adjustment for me, especially being on the receiving end of some back luck (and probably bad play!).

But we didn't pick this up to be a Euro game. I was struck by how the trash talk ramped up and the laughter followed. This was simply a blast. And the fact that I get to name a city "Lube City" to mark the spot of a particularly brutal defeat is icing on the cake.

Risk Legacy is a nice variation on the classic board game. I felt it was a little fiddly, but if you are a big Risk fan I think this would be a must!

RATING: 7
A great variant of Risk.  The board and faction powers change as you play the game.  So the first game you play does not resemble the 12th game you play.  Unfortunately, once all the packets have been opened, the replay value declines.

[b]Thoughts? - [/b]A very decent update to the classic Risk game.  Introduces a number of customisable board pieces and skills.  Limited play of 15 games which isn't that great, and some of the early games over very quickly.  Played with 2-5 players, but a bit crowded with 5.

[b]Still Play Regularly? - [/b]Unlikely to play again (unless we buy a new copy).

I really enjoy the "legacy" part of it.  One of our group members doesn't really enjoy confrontational games, so it isn't seeing much play.

I really want to get a regular group together to play this one. One of my gamer buddies was absolutely repulsed at the idea of tearing up cards, coming up with all sorts of ways to temporarily scar the game, but I plan on playing the game as intended.

I've played this a few times with the family in Oregon and they loved it, but the few turns of customization they did to start the game makes it so much harder to introduce to a new gaming group. 

This game seems to suffer from the fact that you really need a consistent group of people to play this through all 15 times. 

This was a 10 for me, but the inability to play with different groups with the same board drops it down to at least an 8.

Best version of Risk I played. The evolving elements keep it fresh, and add meaning to the outcome. The games tend to be fast, too--sometimes dramatic. I think it is, essentially, "still Risk". In our games, the player who starts in Australia tends to win (3 out of 4 so far). But that may change as we continue to change the board. Fun, worth playing.

I loathe Risk but when one of my game groups had finished the Imperial Assault scenarios we really wanted to start another campaign game. 

Nearly all of us had some level of skepticism around this given the near universal hatred of Risk but everyone has been pleasantly surprised. the excitement of opening envelopes is motivating when you play although we'll have to see how much that continues as there is less to open. (after 6 plays we only have 2 left).

i can't imagine this game would be fun without a steady group but with one it is well worth it.

All you eurogamers run in fear of this game. This is the king of amertrash games. Dice, random cards, player elimination, tearing up cards, writing on the board, the list goes on. This is more a experience than a game.

It's Risk! But shorter and improved. This was the granddaddy of Legacy games, and what a novel idea it was. I really enjoy it, but you need to be okay with being absolutely brutal in order to win, which isn't going to be everyone's thing.

We'll see how this turns out after more plays.

We played an entire campaign.  I have to say, everyone should read the rules ahead of time.  They are organized poorly, and it's easy to misinterpret particular things seeing as the rule book has a bit of a wonky order given when you will see them in a game.

We messed up a number of rules which, in retrospect, really changed things up.

I don't think I had the right play group for it.  It sounds like there is supposed to be quite a bit of ganging up on the leader.  Most players were not willing to do this, as they wanted someone else to attempt it.  Hence, one guy won far more times by the end than the rest of us.  It can also be disheartening when you reach a point where it is a forgone conclusion who the winner will be, regardless of any future wins.

Wow.  A terrific game that starts to shine after four or five games with the same players.  Our recent games have been completely unique and full of metagaming.  The synergies, yeah I said it - synergies, between the mechanics are novel and not things I anticipated.  You can't only play for the current game; decisions you make one game affect the next game.  

Oh, tonight we played two games in 90 minutes.  Crazy.

Twelve games in and everything has been opened!

My rating here is for the "experience" that is Risk Legacy. It's been an amazing time with lots of "Oh man!" and "Holy c#$p!" moments. The way the game changes in ways you don't see coming really is quite cool and something you should try for yourself.

Some suggestions if you're thinking of experiencing Risk Legacy:
* Play with 5 regular players. No fewer.
* Don't rush to open the envelopes. Just let it happen naturally. Doing otherwise will seriously shorten the lifespan of the experience.
* Play for the "experience" not the "game". The "game" is baah-ro-ken. And that isn't a term I like using for any game. But it is what it is.

Having now opened all of the packs (well except for the "Do Not Open Ever" one) my game is what it's essentially going to be for ever more. And honestly I think the chances of us ever playing this game again for "fun" is next to nothing. On the BGG scale I'd have to rate the "game" a 2-3. It's stopped being fun and become just a little bit silly with the way things are now skewed towards particular factions. Maybe something will happen in these last few games to change that view but I rather doubt it.

So, Risk Legacy: Amazing experience, lousy game.

It's a light, fast, reasonably fun game made AMAZING by the simple addition of the Legacy system of episodic play.  Without the momentous weight of future games investing your decisions with consequence and meaning, the game would be pretty shallow and weak.  It's the unknown and the indelible mark each player leaves on future games that makes this one so good.  Ultimately, this game is just Risk though.  I look forward to seeing this kind of episodic play utilized with more interesting games.

Hands down the best in the series. Although I regret not having played Risk Black Ops, so maybe I`m wrong. But anybody that knows me must say in amazement "Do you really tear up cards and place stickers and write stuff directly on the board. Of course I don`t. I laminate almost everything I can and sleeve every card I own. So no this would be blasphemy to destroy the stuff inside. Fortunately I own a colour copying machine and reproduce anything that has to be mangled or changed. Funny how the BGG community reacted when this game came out. I really did not feel their anguish. But lets face it Risk
is Risk and I still prefer my own WWIII - game for world

RATING: 6
This game starts off fairly close to vanilla [gameid=181], a game of which I do not have a particularly high opinion - though you're playing to 4 VP rather than "one player controls the world", along with other changes which shorten playtime and improve the game.

But then there's the customization. You customize the deck and the factions before the first game begins. You customize the board after every game, and during many of the games. You name cities and continents. People being people, they build narratives, and the changing face of the map reminds players of past games, triumphs, defeats, and awesome moments.

It's pretty cool, and is brilliantly produced, giving a wonderful sense of anticipation for the half-dozen-ish "open this when..." packets. I've played four games with my set thus far, and we've opened two of those packets, in addition to using the different changes that start out available from the get-go.

I hope this game does well, because I'd love to see more like it, particularly if some of them are based off of core games other than Risk. The additional contents expand the nature of the game enough that I'm certainly enjoying the heck out of it! - but that would be no less true if the foundation game were something I appreciated more on its own.

Rating this game is tricky; there's the boardgame you sit down and play (which changes over time), and there's the meta aspect of the progressions/changes themselves. I think I'd rate the [i]initial[/i] boardgame-you-play as a 4 or a 5, but the meta aspect as an 8-10. After four plays, the boardgame-you-play has risen to a 6 or so, with the meta aspect remaining high.

Bought this at Value Village for $4.99.  It had only been played twice.  The second packet in the lid has been opened and used (for the first time a player is eliminated from the game), and two packets in the bottom of the box have been opened but not used.  I had bought this new for Lorne Cornish's 40th birthday 2 years ago for about $65.  We still haven't played!  This was an excellent find at Value Village.  In great shape.

I love the Legacy mechanics, and the designers turned a 1-rated game into one of my favourites. It's not a surprise that after giving risk an +7 score boost by adding Legacy elements that I gave Pandemic Legacy a 9, since Pandemic on its own is already a 7! However, Risk Legacy has no repeatability due to unbalance by the end - I would give it a 7 for that but it's still a solid 8 for those initial 15 games

Marking up the board? Blasphemy!

Tearing up game cards? Blasphemy!

What a money-whoring gimmick Hasbro has created!

Except... it all culminates in an insanely fun gaming experience.  All of those snobs who stick their noses up at an innovative game like this because it goes against their card-sleeving, player-aid-laminating nature need a massive dose of reality.  Rarely will they play a game more than 15 times--as they are too busy acquiring the new hotness in the gaming world--so who cares if there is an expiration date to this game once the seal is broken? 

Games are about having fun with friends, and this lays the foundation for a great game night.

You mean I get to change the board and cards, factions have different abilities, and the rules change over time?! It feels like war in a way classic Risk never did because every play is in a unique and changed world resulting from the choices we made during the last conflict.

Should probably be rated a 9 in that once it's done, I can't forsee why it'd be worth playing any more on a finished board. But the journey one takes the first time through the amazing ideas in this game is a great example of what this wonderful hobby has to offer. 

I'm also not sure I'd want to play this game again with the same group knowing all the spoilers (I could be wrong), but it'd be worth playing again with all new players if only to watch the joy of their discoveries. I'm hanging on to an extra copy for just that reason.

RATING: 3
Can't fully judge this game but everything I've seen just indicates to me that it is a short version of Risk with the neat concept of permanently changing game rules throughout the results of play. The army miniatures are neat and are a step better than just star shapes but they are not better than other board games with dudes on a map.

There aren't enough rule changes or map changes to really make the game seem different enough to be dramatically more fun than its predecessor despite the daring design. I'd rather see this system in some other board game.

Interesting reboot of an old classic. The whole bit with customizing the player cards and map by actually writing on them, plus the individual packets, is not something I ever would have predicted would be so popular. It's a pretty neat concept, I'll give them that.

As far as game play goes, the customizations and individual factions do add some interesting twists, and the VP system reduces the game from a potential all-day slugfest to a very manageable playing time. The campaign system they've setup will get many players to come back for more, too.

At the end of the day it's still little more than the loveable dice-a-thon it's always been, but at least now it's short.

Rating from 8.5 games in, writing from Le Titties, Western Europe, Earth #0009178.  

Players fight it out on Earth clone, over a series of games.  Literally, a unique concept in game design.  Players participate in a campaign over a series of fifteen games.  Rules begin as fairly standard Risk Revised (although you begin each game in one area - not sprinkled around the globe), but as the game progresses, you get to sculpt your own Earth based on your decisions as well as events that occur during the game.  Pretty quickly you'll be stickering components, signing the board, ripping up cards, opening packets containing new bits, and even plastering rules amendments into the rulebook.  Rob Daviau is a very talented designer who made Risk playable again with Risk Revised/Onyx.  This is is taking it a step further.  A work of genius - get it, play it, enjoy it.

RATING: 7
Gimmicky? Maybe, but there is a draw to adding more and more factors to the game. Each play is very fast, and it lends itself well to repeat play. I think it's a great success to add fun to an otherwise simple game we all thought was boring. Kudos to Rob at the Hasbro design team!

It was fun while it lasted.  We played 15 games over 8 weeks with the same group of 5 and had a lot of fun doing it.  Risk is still Risk but the campaign play and evolving game kept it interesting.

However, we met on week 9 and played two more games on the "finished" board.  The games were less than thrilling and confirmed that this game is basically done for us.  Even opening the "Do Not Open Ever" packet between the two games did nothing to bring the magic back.

A happy result of this has been to remind us how much more fun league play is than just playing whatever game looks neat that week.

RATING: 3
One of the biggest disappointments of 2015.

I've got no problem with "destroying" the game as the campaign goes on but the campaign as a whole leaves a lot to be desired. I never felt drawn into the gameplay.

But most importantly it is still Risk. And Risks hates me. No matter how good I play, I get screwed by the dice every game.

5 games in.  Not as impressive as I'd hoped.  Really enjoy all the ideas and effort by the designers, but the actual game play has been shitty for our board at least.  So far games last maybe 2 to 3 turns and have been far from interesting.  Perhaps the overall arc gets better but after 5 plays it has not left me wanting more.  Brilliant idea to get people to put Risk on the table several times.  Honestly have liked other risk games more,  but maybe 10 games in I'll change my mind.  The fact that you must play 10 games to figure that out is genius.  Hasbro definitely should give these designers some raises.

RATING: 8
A reimagining of the classic Risk game which changes over time.  Permanent alterations are made to the board during every game, which carry over to affect all future games.  New rules and powers permanently come into play when certain conditions occur, drastically altering future plays.

The series of games that I played of Risk: Legacy with my old game group ranks as one of my Top 3 gaming experiences. It was the same group of four guys every game and experiences developed that would never happen in any other game. The permanent modification of stuff created this trait where long term strategic planning, not just for the current game but for future games, came into play. You'd see players develop trends early on and make modifications to adjust. Negotiations opened where they weren't to win but to unlock stuff (which in turn created openings to exploit in the game). Long after many games sessions fade to time and memory, this series of games will stay with me a lifetime.

RATING: 2.5
I'm not that annoyed at how this game only allows for one playthrough.  I think it would be fun to frame the final board and hang it in someone's gameroom.  But first, this game would have to be fun.  And Risk's core experience is pretty bad, so Legacy has its work cut out for it.

And despite its interesting story potential, the kingmaker tendency (awarding the missiles for each win) makes this game an absolute dealbreaker.  Winning each game makes it easier to win next game.  This adds yet another broken and unbalanced mechanic to a broken and unbalanced basic game experience.  Trash.

Waiting to rate until we finish the campaign.  Initial thoughts after 4 games:

If you are losing, thankfully the game is over in under two hours.

Losing your starting star for winning doesn't seem to be that big of a deal.  No matter how my husband tries to sell it, no one at the table thinks he is at a disadvantage for starting with one less star.

Selecting last for starting position may not be fun the first few games when there may only be one or two good locations but fortunately as the game progresses more good spots are created.

Our group only got through five games before giving up. The legacy concept was great, and we loved opening up new stuff and altering the game board. What we didn't love was the fact that at the end of the day we were still playing Risk, which is not a very good game to begin with, even with all the tweaks Legacy brings.

Love the legacy mechanic of this (and this was the original legacy game) but overall it is still Risk and I think the other legacy games are better overall games/experiences.

The changing over time is a cool idea, but Risk is not a good base to build from in the first place!

It is risk which as a game I can take or leave, adding zany board altering effects to it does not enhance the game for me, but helps it appeal to those interested in wanting a back story for their game.

I respect the risk taken in making a game with the unique board altering approach.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Before Legacy, I'd played Risk of any flavor maybe 3 times since college. 4 friends and I played 15 games on a friends copy of the game. (I wasn't at every session)

It's the 'Legacy' part that's fun. Without the changing of the map board, cards, and most importantly, the opening of envelopes, I don't think I'd have been very interested in the game. 

Although you can continue to play the game after 15 plays, I don't have any desire to.

If you have some buddies that are reliable to show up whenever you pull this game out, it's completely worth it. There are several moments in this game that will absolutely blow your mind. It's one of my favorites... but I wish I could get the same people together each time!

RATING: 7.5
Best Risk game every.
The board, the teams, the rules, and just about every aria of the game is costamizable.  Groundbreaking.  It realy is true that no two copies of the game will end up the same.  You also get to make a world of violence after your image, and in the end the board is a memory of the good times you and your freinds had creating it.
One MAJOR shortfall of the game is that once you have played your fist 15 games and finalized your game, most of the fun disapears.  You need to go out and buy a new coppy and start over to get the same effect again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great game (4 plays thus far):

1) Changing gameboard is amazing. Really adds connection the events in the earlier games, like a campaign almost where each player is a mercenary general.

2) Playtime is around 60 minutes with aggressive players. Great for my group which doesn't have the time to dedicate 2 hrs to a board game.

3) Simple rules, yet few special objectives add great spice and variety to each game.

UPDATE: Downgrade from 8.5->8. Suffers from Risk Cold War Game Mentality, where as soon as someone attacks, he is attacked, so seems to promote stalemates and static game-play in our group.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I cannot believe I'm going to say this, but I've finally found a version of Risk that I can not only tolerate, but actually like.  Needs a little tweaking of the VPs, but it's a fun and relatively quick game (unlike older versions).  I recommend finding a steady group and playing this from beginning to end with the same folks if at all possible.

It took 11 games for us with 5 players to open all the packets.  A little disappointed it took this long as it seems late for everything to be out and we won't really get the chance to use everything.  We know there are missions and events we haven't seen due to the randomness of them being pulled.

Only played 14 of the 15 games as after the 14th game, a clear winner was had and nobody would catch him.

Update: Now that a winner has been declared, probably will not play through this again as it was a one time event to discover the events.  Knowing ahead of time what is out there and what triggers it will affect game play from the beginning of a new game.

Excellent, excellent version of Risk, and a wonderfully innovative approach to gaming.
Playing over a dozen games with the same group of 5 players, and watching the game rules and components evolve was a thrilling and unforgettable experience that created lasting memories (many of which are immortalized on the board itself).

The first 5 games were fun.. but then this degenerated quickly into drawn out games that were essentially Risk at their heart.  I think there is a lot of factors that could change the experience for different groups of players.  For us, it became a chore to try and play the complete 15 games and in the end, we didn't finish.

Risk...what can I say...this version is the modern version where turtling can't help, Asia can't be controlled in time to get the benefit, and on top of it the players get power, and alter the board in entertaining and unique ways.

I have no idea if the end product will be cool or hideous, but the first 3 games wizzed by. I think as each player wins at least one the game will settle down and become more of what Risk is traditionally known as, but I'll reserve my opinion 'till I get there.

Fun opening the crazy packets? YES!

Fixes everything I had a problem with in Risk.  The only other thing I would prefer is to roll more than 2/3 dice.  Individual combats are highly variable.

I really appreciate that someone took a classic design and brought it up to the modern gaming era.

What an amazing concept. It keeps you wanting to play all the time. I can't wait to play more.

I have no problem with using up the stickers and board. I have loads of versions of Risk and have never played any of the 15 times yet so this one will actually have been worth its money if I get to complete the full campaign.

This game has captured me so much I actually had a semi sleepless night thinking and dreaming about it.

+ The legacy granddaddy.  Or at least the first truly successful one.  I like the legacy system games, deal with it.  This one has some neat surprises!

This game is decidedly NOT for everyone. Fortunately for us, it is a near-perfect fit for our group and our overall attitude towards games. We have a group of five that gets together to play this game, and two key observations have been made: one, it's unbelievable that no one has thought to produce a customizable board game before; and two, it was Hasbro that finally did it!

Matt Drake put it best in his [url=http://drakesflames.blogspot.com/2012/09/board-game-revisit-risk-legacy.html]follow-up[/url] to his [url=http://drakesflames.blogspot.com/2011/09/board-game-review-risk-legacy.html]original legendary review[/url]: "The surprises that matter are not the ones Hasbro dreamed up. The surprises are the ones you'll create yourself." As great as the surprises in the packets are, what really matters is what you do with them, and the lasting memories that come with creating a board game world that only our group could have come up with. For these and other reasons, we've stuck with a group of 5 people instead of rotating players in and out. The grudges and alliances that have formed in our world are just as key to our RL experience as the board modification and hidden content. (Your mileage may well vary on this point: many groups have had 8-9 different players and loved it. In fact, one of our group members now his own copy of the game and planning on going this route. Of course, it's up to you.)  

If I were to have one criticism of this game, it's that...well...it's still Risk. If you're a hardcore Risk-hater, like so many gamers are, this probably won't change your mind. If you don't mind it, then you'll enjoy this just fine, but be aware that, when you get down to the nitty gritty, the core game is pretty much the same as it's been for the past 50+ years. I can't really say for sure that I'd like it better if it were a more sophisticated rules system, though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Pros
-relative short play time (about 1 hour compared to 4 hour risk)
-innovative: campaign system, permanent change to board
-involves negotiation
-same as original risk, promotes aggressive play but slightly further cuts down on turtling in original risk

Cons
-fairly high cost for disposable game (but one copy consists of many games)
-still just risk, luck based, frustrating combat
-changes to board are mostly lame, e.g. +1 to combat roll for 1st attack
-novelty of writing on board gets boring fast

So far it is regular Risk with some added twist. I like the new end game trigger, this makes the game much faster and more interesting.

Who would have thought a variant of venerable old Risk would be one of the most interesting and innovative games I've played in a while?

Kudos to the designers for coming up with such a great twist on an old staple!

Pumps life back into that old classic game and adds an interesting twist in that a game can actually last for an hour or less instead of "kill me now" long. Tearing up components is fun and surprisingly liberating. But boy does it stink if the dice do not at least give you some passable wins. I am only two games in at this point. The first was fun, the second was awful. I hope when we tear open new stuff that it gets better.

Definitely makes Risk enjoyable again.  The innovative system which allows the game to be customizable brings life to what is a very basic conquer territories game.  I am interested in continuing my venture through the legacy my group has begun and seeing what is in store. Achieving 15 plays from any game is monumental, so building it in to the base is genius - and it helps that the game is fun and quick. 

Risk: legacy will change the way people approach game design in the future.  Kudos to Hasbro for waking up to the new era in games and not sitting back and resting on their profits of pushing subpar/out-dated games.

Rating subject to change - it really could get much higher than this. R:L is largely Risk at its core, but crucially it plays much faster, definitely avoiding the endless stalemates of the old game, and those bit-sized chunks are more interesting than any epic campaign of days yonder. Also - no spoilers - what little I've experienced of the "persistent" changes has been awesome. How that plays out with your group over time probably determines how much mileage you get out of this.

Looking forward to continuing our 15 game campaign of this.

Pros: THE game to share with friends: the different races, powers, unlocking packets, stickers and destroying cards gives the game legendary status in  my book. It creates a game board with its own history, almost feels like painting a masterpiece instead of playing a game. You will surely say OMG when opening the first long packet!

Cons: It's still RISK, which means that no matter the number, if lady luck isn't in your dice you can't win. So approach with a non competitive mindset, ie: Bring beer.

Update -- coming back to play a couple of games after a year or so. There are parts of the game that are fun, but overall it's a frustrating experience. There is still a lot of down time, and I don't generally like games where you wipe each other out, because you spend so much time without a chance to win.

So I honestly don't know how to rate it. The concept is fantastic, where the game evolves with the players and choices are permanent. I just don't know if the underlying game is actually any fun. I really hope other games that aren't world-conquering or 4X games try out something like this.

-----

This is a lot of fun for the first several games, and has become the hot game in my group, so we've played it a lot. But I'm not as enamored anymore...
The Good: Fun to open things up, mark up the board, and see how things evolve. Game times are reasonably short (60 minutes for the first few games, then about 90 for later games). 
The Bad: You realize that it's still hugely random and can be crushingly frustrating because of this. Whoever rolls well at the right time, and gets lucky on the cards, will win, and you can be blown out of the game with bad rolls. Worse than player elimination, you aren't knocked completely out but have no chance of winning.
It's still Risk, so you're going to be rolling a bunch of dice. So if you can be in for "roll dice for 90 minutes, and the lucky person wins" then it's fun. Any complaints about it "only" lasting 15 games are misguided since you won't want to play it more than that.

It's an interesting concept, and the new rules do address many of the original's shortcomings, but the worst offender of the bunch: the awful random dice chucking combat, is still exactly the same excruciating, tedious, rage inducing experience it was when I was a kid. 50 vs 2....and you lose?!?

Well it's still Risk; but it's a really improved/changed version.  
First hearing about tearing up cards and writing on the board made me a little quesy.  That was quickly gone though.  One round and I was into chucking some dice and marching toward the enemy.  
I really like what they have done with this version.  The permanent effects are a great addition to the game and make each set unique to every other.
Looking forward to the next game!

Bought in December 2011.

This game is amazing. This isn't a game, it's a campaign (and way better if you always play with the same people). You get that new box opening rush again and again. Destroying cards is also a rush. Naming continents. The "Do Not Open. Ever." All brilliant.

Most games end on a wonderfully climactic and often unexpected punt that truly honours the name "Risk".

In my first game, an opponent named a city "Traitor Fish" (Fish is my name). He conceded that I had not betrayed anybody, but he reckoned that *claiming* I was a traitor (and inscribing it on the board) would make me less trustworthy in future games. Only a game like this could give him such a wonderfully innovative way to be a git!

After 20 or so plays I'm done with it, but I got a LOT of juice out of those plays.

The legacy concept is legit and makes for a exciting experience.  In the 'Longview' the game becomes more meaningful and interesting.  So, don't listen to the haters, legacy is a great system.  Nonetheless, Risk Legacy is still a version of Risk.  So, if you aren't at least a bit of a fan of Risk you might not enjoy it much.  For me, it has been like meeting an old friend I'd grown apart from...only to find we really are still friends.

RATING: 6
Meh. I like regular Risk and Risk 2210AD more. For the following Reasons:

1 It seems to be a game with a Run away winner problem. Not only does the winner get a winner bonus that usually lets them hunker down and be stronger, but they also get a "automatic 6" die roll token for each time they win. Yes, everyone else starts with a victory star that can easily be taken away by someone with "auto win" tokens.

2 You have to agree to align against this person to stop a second victory, which isnt really in the spirit of why Risk is played.

3 Our packages were all mixed up. So the surprises didnt make sense.

4 Perhaps possible, but controlling all of Asia seems impossible and have yet to see anyone do it. The hunker down in Australia method is alive and well.

RATING: 5.5
Six plays. The win condition and the rules that incentivize players to attach each other improve the game, and it's fun to have a "history" imprinted onto the game, but at the end of the day it's still just Risk. There's a first-player advantage, and the go-to strategy is the same—hole up in Australia and keep a low profille until you're ready to lunge for the win.

Addendum: we've now gotten to the point where we've been able to open new packets and add rules to the game, and of course that's fun. Unfortunately, the way things have shaken out during our campaign has left the game badly unbalanced — because of all the major cities, minor cities, and scars, the two best starting spots on the board are "reserved" for two players exclusively. Certainly it's not a game to take too seriously in terms of winning and losing, but it does make it a little less fun for the players whose only strategy is to hope that someone else makes a mistake.

The Legacy idea is interesting but at the end of the day it's still Risk.  Someone can still be eliminated an hour before the game finishes and it's still possible to be waiting 20 minutes between turns.  There's no 'storyline' to Risk Legacy that I can see and the lack of continuation with a personal race makes winning or losing and the adding of abilities inconsequential.

UPDATE OCT 14: Oh man. Okay, so I've had the chance to actually playtest a new iteration of this idea, and am beginning to see how some of the choices came together for this iteration. Let it be known, I had a rough experience with this one, but am looking forward to the idea being implemented in a non-Risk game. Milage may vary on this one, however. 

----

No idea what to rate this yet. After three plays my group got a little tired of the essential Risk gameplay formula, in spite of all the interesting trappings.
--
New Report: important to note that many of the powers benefit repeat winners. Concessions to losers, such as extra stars, do not help when someone gets to be sole possessor of Australia, game after game. In four plays, Australia has won three times, each time fortifying and making it stronger.

Hey, here's a SPOILER ALERT: Risk is a very stupid game. Throwing in randomly-derived, unplaytestable rules actually makes it stupider and more frustrating.

Make no mistake, this is sour grapes. I hate losing to someone who's strategy comes down to rolling fives and sixes. That said, even the winner said it's no fun anymore. Our last game took a miserable four hours.

This "heirloom" will probably never get played to 15 games, yet if I want to get rid of it to make space for something worthwhile, I'll actually have to throw it in the garbage, as it's festooned with ugly little stickers of questionable import to gameplay.

The game is far from perfect -- this game lends itself to kingmaking far too much -- but a lot of fun, and is quick enough to never be offensive.  Games from 30 mins to 3 hours (rarely) can be expected.  Pure fun if you grew up on Risk, at least IMO.

I hate Risk...


But I love Risk: Legacy!  It is totally awesome.  First of all, it is much quicker than the brutally long and boring Risk.  Also, the game inherently rewards risk-taking rather than risk avoidance.  Altering the map is a perpetually fun experience, but opening up the new packs and altering the gameplay is completely irreplaceable.  It is much better than playing the beginner -> intermediate -> expert levels on wargames (though I enjoy that difference also).

Summary...complete awesomeness

I have to admit, I haven't been so giddy with childlike anticipation to play a game in a long time. Start with rules that almost everyone is familiar with; add some unique starting faction characteristics; make it so that the board, the rules, and/or the factions will change after every play. That all combines into a wonderful experience. Is the game fantastic? No, not really. But does it bring back childhood memories while satisfying the now-adult gamer? Most definitely.

Played a 15 game campaign with the same 5 players.  Very unique gaming experience.  Lots of fun with, much guile and backstabery.  Opening the packs and seeing how the world changes is really exiting.  Games are more strategic then basic Risk, but there is still plenty of luck to go around.  I don't think it will be played much now that the campaign is done.  Still it was a fun ride.

The unknown elements are a nice touch, but even better is the fact that there are base elements to the rules that make the games go much faster.  Victory Points instead of having to take over the whole world.  No more collecitng sets of cards that give progressively better numbers.  Plus starting out in one spot instead of spread out all over the board.  Feels much more like a wargame.  It's fun to play Risk now!

Strange concept to actually deface your board with stickers and player comments. It's a great addition to the Risk Genre. I find it hard to sell it to other boardgamers since they are all biased because of the Risk in the name. It's a loss for them since it's the only game that I find in which every decision has tremendous impact on how the board develops.

I was never a big Risk fan, by any means, and this is still, to some extent, Risk.  But the implementation of it and the way it's customized is brilliant, and I can't imagine that working quite as well on a game other than Risk (which is simple enough and has enough conflict to particularly reward the evolution of the game in this way).  As others have said, you do not destroy this game, you evolve it gradually over time, and every change becomes an important part of the overall history.  I've only played one game so far, and it's already a fascinating gaming experience with a lot of anticipation for the campaign to come.

Probably the worst 3 player game I have ever played. This game should have never been advertised at that player count. Basically at some point when the first two players attack each other, the third can just sit back and watch them weaken themselves enough to allow him to move in for the win. A version of this has played out in every single one of our 6 games. May be good if you have 4 or 5, run as fast as you can if you only have 3.

I find this idea very intriguing. As for the issue of altering the game, I think it is fantastic. I read the rule book too and it seems the narrative arch of the game is intended to span 15 games. I think that is still great entertainment value for the money, plus you are left with your own game you can continue to play but that you truly feel invested in. I will buy this game and am excited to see how the story unfolds.

Incredibly original idea and the best implementation of risk yet.  The beginning of game bidding phase, variable player powers, and continuation effects really make this a cool use of the risk system/license.

The combat and movement are unabashedly classic risk, but the special powers and different victory condition possibilities, combined with a quicker playtime, put a very cool spin on the old classic.

The idea of playing a campaign of fifteen games with an actual developing narrative is a great one.  I do think this will help the game among the "small never-changing gaming group" crowds.  It also will be great for game stores, since a "store copy" can become a community narrative.  The idea will probably hurt the game for board game collector types, who buy lots of games and get each out once or twice a year at most to play with wildly different groups.  This type of gamer isn't going to like the idea of needing to buy a new copy after fifteen plays, and the continuation of narrative won't mean much since you may not even recall the earlier plays.

If you aren't familiar with Risk: Legacy, it's basically the revised version of Risk with some chrome added. And by chrome I mean stickers you place on the cards, permanent marker you use to write on the board, tearing up special powers, adding new rules to the rulebook, opening packets of cards, etc. The game itself changes every time you play. Of course, if you treat your games with white gloves, this concept is going to make you cringe a bit.

Risk: Legacy has created a completely new category of games, and it is awesome. It's probably the closest board game equivalent to that feeling of unlocking an achievement in a video game. When you get to open a packet and see all the new toys you get to play with the next game, it's a feeling almost like an addiction. You have to play again.

This is the toughest game for me to rate. A 9 in BGG terms is "I always want to play this". A 10 is the same but with the clause "I expect this will never change." Sadly, I absolutely expect this will change. The thrill of this game is opening up the new packets and trying them out. After 15-20 games, will we still want to play? Probably, but probably only occasionally. I think that Risk 2210 is going to remain my favorite Risk iteration when it's all said and done. This game is more of an experience than a game. I've described it like going to see a movie. It's fun while it's happening, but you can't experience it again without paying again. Most board games are more like buying the DVD. So I would place this at a 9 for the first 15 games or so, and a 6 afterwards. Having finished our board, it stays at a 6. Even starting again will probably not have the same thrills as it did the first time.

Should you buy/play Risk: Legacy? Absolutely. I've never experienced a board game like this. Even if you don't like Risk, I think the thrill of this new system would be enough to warrant getting this. It's just still hard for me to say where it will ultimately end up another 10 or so plays from now.

At its heart, it is still Risk, but it is a lot more enjoyable and plays significantly faster thanks to the streamlined rules. The legacy system, however, is what makes it a really special and awesome experience.

One of the best games I've ever played. It's like Risk - but the game changes, evolves. You can destroy the game with stickers, writing on the board, ripping up cards. Opening hidden packs of armies, hidden objectives in mini envelopes. It's so cool. It's *SO* different from any other game I've played. Only downside is after 15 games the game doesn't really change too much. There's still a few things to do, but it loses it's fun quality of evolution (or legacy). Otherwise - amazing, amazing game.

One of the most entertaining, clever, surprising, and innovative games I've ever played. The core of this game is Risk, highly streamlined and sped up for modern times. But, new mechanics, surprises, and evolutionary moments come out every game. We've finished the first 7 games and I think it's safe to say the REAL game is just now beginning.

I've played this with a steady group of 4 other friends. Playing this together as a campaign has been one of the most enjoyable gaming moments for me. 

Highly recommended.

UPDATE:  It's a game!  It's an art project!  It's a cruel psychological experiment!  It's all these things and more... like a roller coaster full of plus-size swimsuit models* it thrills and titillates through the ups and downs.  Only three games in and the burning of Earth 12769 already has a unique narrative.  [i]And this is without opening any packets.[/i]  With sticker and Sharpie we have left our mark on this embattled world—the warlords of Thunderia, New Sparta and Sasquatchistan showing themselves to be more than willing to pop nukes in pristine old-growth forests and water the virgin plains with the blood of orphans in order to... to... uh, I used to know the reasons why, but now all I know is [i]hate.[/i]

Don't fool yourself—if you're not defacing the hell out of this game you're not even getting 1% of the experience it has to offer.  It's like the difference between masturbating to an underwear catalog vs. a threesome with real people.  Tell yourself whatever makes you feel better all alone with your anal retentive proclivities, but if you're not putting your mark on it [i]you are not playing the game.[/i]

This is, only three games in, among the best gaming experiences I've ever had.

11/1: You're absolutely right; giving a boardgame a 1 rating without playing it is not doing the rating system any favors.  Therefore, I withdraw the 1 and reset the rating to a N/A. That was a kneejerk, cynical response that I had, frankly, totally forgot that I had done until I was called for an NPR interview on this very subject.  No, I am NOT joking.  So, I'm sorry about the initial 1, but the rest of my comments stand.

9/15: Rating based upon preliminary rules read, and general disgust with this idea.  Am I the only person in the universe that thinks this is a moronic notion?  You're purchasing a commercial game (presumably at today's hefty prices) to play a campaign that basically alters the original game to a state where it is unusable for a second game?  Ask yourself how big of a moron Hasbro takes you for.  This is either genius or a cynical cash grab by Hasbro, and I won't bother revealing which one my money's on.

This is an ok game, but one of the richest gaming experiences I have ever had.  DO NOT MISS this gaming experience.  Get 4 or more player friends of roughly the same skill level and guard your board against exploitation.  15 plays will bring forth an amazing play experience that will help define your playgroup building a legendary tale you can reflect on often.  After completing our board I went out and bought my own to save for when my children are older.  It still amazes me that this designer can take a dull game and create such an epic play experience partially by making the core game shorter.

I love this game! However, I'm in a weird position: I'm only 3 or 4 games into the 15 game pseudo-campaign and one of  my group members really really hates the game and won't play it any more.  I'd love to pick it up again with another group, but they wouldn't have the same kind of investment in the game as the other 3 people in our group have.  Also, if I join a new group with a new copy of the game, I already know what's in some of the sealed packets which would ruin the element of surprise from the first few games.  It's a really creative and groundbreaking game that requires a bit of dedication to fully enjoy.

Without a doubt, this game has produced the best gaming stories I'll be talking about years from now! I have some nostalgia for Risk as a kid, also got the LotR edition. But I've had very little interest in playing it the last 10 years; probably made 3 attempts at LotR-Risk with maybe 1 completion.

But Risk-Legacy is amazing and really does away with the worst parts of traditional risk. Two examples without trying to spoil... First: game 4, I won on my very first turn, before one of the players even had a turn (without any starting stars)! Second: game 7 I was completely knocked out on the first turn of the game (my turn!) with my first dice roll which triggered 3 missiles used in one roll. (later i rejoined the war, and slowly built up and was a good contender before another player ended the game).

The game that redefined the rules for me. Even being a risk game based on luck of the dice, the evolution of this game almost negates the luck. An immersive and fascinating experience that will set the tone for the many legacy games that will no doubt follow, but will struggle to replicate the sheer thrill of this, opening up new sections, destroying cards, defacing the game board.

Over 15 games, simply the greatest gaming experience I have ever had, or likely ever will have. An absolute must play for every gamer as this one changes absolutely everything.

"Defies the description of a game".

Once this game is complete, it meets the criteria for a 1 vote.  It is no longer a game and thus defies that description.

I played with 4 friends.  The game has 15 mini-games that evolve as you play.  Very cool concept.  The game is constantly changing as players make choices that permanently affect the board, but the game mechanics remain the same.  There is also a lot of strategic choices to make.  There are a few small changes to the rules I wish they had made because I feel a few characters have a huge advantage, mainly the owner said that the starting roll determines BOTH choice of faction AND country.  The is a difficult advantage to overcome.  Also, some factions could have better attributes to even the game a little.  That said, it is one of the best games I have played recently.

Initial Rating 7.0 (March 2012)

I have only played once, so far it´s been very similar as regular Risk, however the playtime was greatly reduced, and for that, I’m thankful as that was my main complaint about vanilla Risk.

I´m glad a friend of mine bought this as clearly it is not a game I could own. As I’m very anal about my games, I cringe every time we have to tear, write, sign or paste something up, IMO all the changes could have been tracked in a paper without altering the game. I recognize this is innovative and the main appeal of the game, but it just doesn´t work for me.

I´m not completely sold with the new starting rules but I have to play again to really see how they work, it seems some players can get unfair advantage from the beginning due to order sitting.

It seems like a very good Risk implementation and I really want to know what happens next, for now I´m giving it a 7.0 as the experience is similar to Risk but  a lot shorter. 

Current Rating: 7.0

I want to play more of this, however, I have become a lot harsher with my ratings so I’m downgrading Risk Legacy rating. As I’m trying to match my feelings for the game with the BGG recommendation rating system, now I rate Risk Legacy a 6.5. Still a good rating, but just shy of a good game I would like to play often. Also, I heavily dislike the disposable boardgame idea (but I recognize it is very novel). 

Current Rating: 6.5

I heavily dislike Legacy games. I come from a third world country and since I was a child I was taught to not generate waste, so the idea of permanently change a game is anathema to me. When I do that, I lose all the financial value of the game (I cannot sell an used copy if I want to) and I facilitate the generation of waste. I’m sure all the Legacy games could be done in a way that you could reset them to their initial estate without losing any of the fun and/or surprises of playing through them (examples of this that come to mind are T.I.M.E Stories, Mechs and Minions and Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: Rise of the Runelords – Base Set). I understand that the permanent change is the whole point of the Legacy system, but I cringe every time I see a friend tearing the components of the game. I know I’m in the small minority here :D, but that’s the reason I dislike Legacy games, for me those games are really disposable and that makes me sad.

I won’t ever buy a Legacy game.

Besides that small rant, I’m downgrading Risk Legacy’s rating because my desire to play the game again is low. I don’t think we well ever finish the campaign we started.

Uh. It's still Risk, and the best part of the game, opening new stuff and naming things doesn't happen until the game is over, so you have to play Risk at least once to get to the good stuff, and based on the labels maybe a lot more before you get to open the tabs and add new stuff. Kind of a bummer.

Very enjoyable experiences playing this game through many campaigns. Of course the lack of replay-ability is a negative, and the fact that you must go through each campaign with the same group you started with. If you have a steady group of 4 people and like Risk buy this game and enjoy the 12ish plays you get. You won't regret it. Otherwise, not a must have.

Risk Legacy is the culmination of all previous iterations of Risk, and it is, in fact, the best. The simple rules and quick playing time allow for a group to have a robust, memorable gaming journey together over 15 very manageable sessions. The various "legacy" elements (faction abilities, scars, proprietary cities, etc.) make for welcome additions and infuse the Risk system with new possibilities. This won't be the best game you've ever played, but it will certainly rank among the most unique.

Victory brings spoils as you get to alter the board for future games. This is Risk turned into a battle campaign, and you need to have the same players each and every time to make this really an effective purchase. If you're not a serious war gamer who wants to invest in new strategies, skip this and stick with the original.

BIG PLUS: victory rewards alter future games permanently
HUGE MINUS: requires investment from all players for multiple games, keeps out new players mid-campaign

An awesome and unique experience in gaming. 

The whole idea behind Risk: Legacy is that you will make the game different by your (and your group's) playing it successively.  It goes against a lot of our mentality as gamers, trying to keep everything perfect and in pristine condition, etc... but this game evolves... on purpose,... and I must say that is is super fun watching it do so.  The "secrets" included in the game are just one of many reasons to come back to it. 

I've been playing Risk just about my entire life and after being rather bored of it, this breathes all sorts of new life into the basic game, taking it to never before reached heights.  If you appreciate risk for what it is, but have since played it to death, this is exactly what you need to rediscover a classic gaming experience that will eventually become your very own personalized creation.  Don't hesitate to make a mess of this map!

Hands down the BEST version of RISK.  Evolving game keeps things interesting.  Strategies have to change between and even during games.  Simplified victory system means games don't last 3 days, but more like 2 hours tops.  

I've played through 4 boards of this game with various groups and it's ALWAYS a good game to play.  We even did a double board version, made it 5 victory stars to win, and it only took 3 hours.  Excellent game, buy it if you haven't already!

Interesting game.  After one play, interested in how the game evolves.

After a couple of months of play, I am impressed with this game.  It has been a while since a game has dominated the attention of our group so much.  And that it is a Risk varient is really surprising.

Far more to this game than meets the eye.

The most innovative game I've ever played. We played all 15 games and I loved every minute of it. Opening the envelopes was awesome. The only complain that I have is that it has a slight "rich get richer" problem in that the more you win the more you have an advantage in future games. But as long as all players realize this and make it harder on the person in the best position it's not too bad.

I was very pleasantly surprised with this one.  After not playing risk for 30+ years because I discovered "real" games, I was skeptical about this.

The game start and end game conditions make this the best version of risk. The legacy elements are great and give a true sense of accomplishment, but the game loses it's flavor after the 15th game. I've bought and played this game twice to completion, both with different groups, but we've never gone back to a completed board.

I have since bought a third copy and, using my laser cutter, have placed all the stickers onto chip board markers. I've put them back inside their envelopes to retain the "unlocking" for new players, but now I can play the game forever, with anyone, without having to buy another copy.

12 games in, I feel like the big Legacy aspects are too slow, too few and far between, and the smaller ones don't have enough impact for my taste. Also, in the end, this is Risk, one of the worst games there are, and despite the changes, the Legacy aspect is not enough to make up for that. Plus, the added parts feel greatly unbalanced. I'll still play it 'till the end, but I had a second copy I'll probably try to trade away.

Rating after 1 play.

Risk: Legacy is a perfect game for what it does.  It takes the mechanics of a classic game and lets players customize the game as they play, like you are one of the game designers.  It was really fun picking a starting power for YOUR faction, placing that first scar, and finally naming a continent at the end of the game.

It also has a huge nostalgia aspect for everyone that played Risk in their kitchen/basement/garage.  I grinned the first time someone said, "One and one."

I lower the rating for this game after every play.  Maybe it's because I played a lot of actual Risk but I can't get used to the speed of this game.

It's the same thing every game: I build up an army slowly and carefully defend my borders and despite controlling a third of the board the game is over before I even have a chance to use my army, because another player bum rushed 2 other bases and miraculously got to 4 stars.  In one game I didn't even get to take my third turn -in RISK!

I feel like each player starting with a star token is the biggest flaw in this game, but we don't get together as a group enough to playtest house rules.

I know this is a very popular game and when we opened the box I was bursting at the seems but the more we play the more disappointed I am.

Yes, it's Risk, but not the same-old tired and worn out Risk that we played as kids.  The modifications make this an all-new game, and fun.  We played three games in three hours the first time we opened it.

After one session, I can tell that it am going to have some fun with this game.  We have ripped up a few cards, applied some stickers to the board, and named 1 continent.  And I got to sign the board as the first victor.

I think it was pretty savvy doing this treatment to Risk, a game we all have progressed beyond.  It gives a solid bedrock, that we know, and illustrates the variant game differences we will inflict to it.

If we actually play out 15 games, we will have gotten our money's worth.  And the novelty of an evolving game is very attractive.

I never thought I would be so excited to play Risk again!

If you're on BGG, you probably know the deal with this game. The legacy components do a great job of making the base game more exciting, but the base game is still the same old Risk. Is it worth it? I'd say yes, but purely because of the legacy aspects.

The only problem I have with it is that it is a commitment eith the same people to go through the 15 games. Other than that after two games I think this is more brutal than general risk. The simplification so far for getting 4 stars in a game instead of hidden objectives is a lot more "balanced" . Players can work out more eqsily who is posing the biggest thread to win.

Far more interesting than regular Risk, period. Once you've got a few games down, the fickleness of the dice is compensated by faction powers, various scars and the missles. Not recommended with three or less players though, and once you've played two games, it is inadvisable to invite a new player to the board.

Still haven't figured out whether a permanently-altered-campaign-boardgame is an incredibly awesome idea, or an incredibly devious marketing scheme.  But all the crazy love for this game convinced me to get a copy; now I just have to decide which group to run through this thing with.  (I've read the rules, but I'm not breaking the seal on the box until we're all in the room.)

Maybe I need [i]two[/i] copies, one for the Thursday night crowd and one for--[i]oh you bastards.[/i]  I feel used, ashamed, & excited.

One interesting thing is how a consumable board game makes me think about playing it.  I'm not just going to play this with whoever happens to show up; I'm looking for people to commit to a campaign before even opening the box with them, because if we get a couple games into it and people aren't able to play regularly, then the game is kind of wasted.

[b]Update:[/b] after Ray & Dan laughed at me for buying it, I'm back in the "incredibly devious marketing scheme" camp, and am no longer dazzled by the idea of having to buy three copies of a $70 boardgame if I want to play it with three different groups.  I'm thinking I'll make proxies, so that we can still have the full effect of permanently destroying components, without buying three goddamn copies of the game.

[b]Update:[/b] To be able to play multiple campaigns, I'm using hand-drawn maps and desktop-printed versions of the cards.  (Examples [geekurl=/image/1266803]here[/geekurl].  It takes me about 45 minutes to make a map, and only a few more minutes with a straightedge & razor knife to cut out new cards.  Instead of stickers, scars are drawn onto the map, and dots on the resource cards are scribbled in with pens.)

So far I've only played the first game or two in each campaign; I like that it's pretty fast-playing, but... because of the way Risk works, games have invariably gone to the player who [i]didn't[/i] fight, and who just sat there building up until everyone else ground themselves down.  I hope some of the unopened packets include rules which change that, because a game in which the winning strategy is to turtle is going to be pretty goddamn dull.

[b]Thoughts on legacy-style games now that Pandemic Legacy is coming out:[/b]

[article=9202422]I am glad I used proxies[/article] for this game, and I don't think I would play legacy-style games any other way (unless it's [i]your[/i] copy we're talking about...).  The "that means you're playing a variant" argument is nonsense; with proxies, you're tearing up cards & permanently altering the map the same as anyone else.

I also reject the "[article=8752741]how many games really get played 15 times?[/article]" argument for buying a game designed for limited plays.

(Out of three or four sets I made, I'm not sure I ever hit a [i]total[/i] of 15 plays, but that's because, at its core, the game is still Risk, which none of us are really that interested in.  The reason I don't regret buying it is that it's an interesting [i]idea,[/i] and I had fun figuring out how to make proxies.)

[b]Update:[/b] One of the few games I've ever literally thrown away.  No one wants a used copy, and it wasn't going to get played again, so... tore it up & threw it in the recycling bin.

RATING: 6
Some very cool ideas added to the core of Risk. 

But it's still Risk at its core, which means, for one thing, lots of wild unpredictable swings. Worse, for me, is that it also means a lot of heated table negotiations (which is really what the game is about). Too much Risk, even in this novel form, is just not healthy.

(I am very much looking forward to Pandemic Legacy).

Risk Legacy represents what is if not a new, at least a rare concept to boardgaming: campaigning. At its core, the game, particularly at first, plays much like regular Risk with a few changes. Players control countries or regions on a map of the world, and through simple combat (with players rolling dice to determine who loses units in each battle) they try to eliminate all opponents from the game board or control a certain number of "red stars", otherwise known as victory points (VPs).

What's different is that Risk Legacy' changes over time based on the outcome of each game and the various choices made by players. In each game, players choose one of five factions; each faction has uniquely shaped pieces, and more importantly, different rules. At the start of the first game, each of these factions gains the ability to break one minor rule, such as the ability to move troops at any time during your turn, as opposed to only at the end.

This game is the most flippin amazing game I have played in a while. Or maybe ever. I dont know. Never played Risk before. Never really cared for it. Now we are one game away from finishing our campaign and I know that this game is just...mind blowing. It may be the best game I have ever played, not that I've played many. We're trying to come up with new expansions on our own to keep changing the world and we still have a packet to open. I've even thought about asking everyone if they want to get another copy. Just a great game. 

Edit: Got some interesting expansion ideas that will probably appear in the forums soon.

Classic. I liked Risk as a kid, but I was always frustrated with how long the game took. This fixes that problem, while also adding in legacy mechanics that change the game as you play. There are several pivotal, huge moments in the game that had our whole table laughing and yelling in surprise. I met four people from the internet I didn't know for the first game, and we all played a game a week until we were done, mainly because this game was so fun.

Best ever edition of Risk.  Now, I may find it easier to say this as this isn't my copy of Risk that is getting ripped up, board written on with pen, and rules constantly changing, but the adventure is a good time.  Games tend to be quick as well as one only needs 4 VPs to win and everyone initially starts with 2.  As you win, you only start with 1 VP and more missiles.  I find myself looking forward to the developing storyline and badly desiring to continue playing to unwrap the mystery of what lies ahead!  Interesting to consider that every person who buys and completes fifteen plays of this game will have very unique gameboards as well as each player personalizes the board to some degree.  Very fun!  First time in a long time that I didn't try to commit suicide by spreading myself too thin playing Risk...;-)

I have reduced the rating to a 6 as I now find the game rather, well, like Risk now that we have finished editing the board.  One more change could happen in that we could establish another sea lane if we complete said mission.  I do think it was ingenious in creating the concept, but in the end, the game is still Risk.

Unfair to provide a score after just the first game.  But the anticipation before playing, this is a game you need to know a little about but not too much, the concept and necessary commitment from a group of friends to the game make this one of the most exciting and engaging game experiences I have ever come across.  This is before even considering the incredible ideas and innovation bursting out of the box.  

At this moment my only worry is that the 15 games will be over too soon.

After the second game the narrative to the game has been developing and the game has gone beyond the table as pacts and agreements are starting to be discussed by email.  Three factions (in a four player game) have already started to discuss a Tehran Conference pact against the fourth faction.

Have done terribly both games (I am part of the Tehran Conference) but enjoyed every moment.

RATING: 9
The game or risk, more like the Castle risk system, where you are defending your capital while trying to get a few objective points or others capitals. No world domination in these games. It is fun to change the board & alter your factions throughout the games. The legacy system was born in this game. 

My wife & I have not been able to play with the same people, but we are hoping to start to get a semi-regular group of people to finish out the rounds with us. Love it so far. Tons different from Regular Risk but marking the board & changing it is very scary at first.

Played game 6 July 11th 2015. Opened a lot of packets this last time. Looking forward to some new scar cards and changes to the game. 

Played game 7 July 17 2016 opened last packet. Only the world capital left to open. Had a blast and one of our quickest games ever. Quick but fun!

Finished off the first world. I actually won 5 in a row, the factions are set, the land is ravaged and we start a new board this weekend (3/31/12). This is the most fun I have had in gaming in a long time. The amount of smack talk, conversing and meta gaming between games makes this a must have for our gaming group. I can see us going through a few more board before we are bored with it.

I'm not sure it's possible to say enough good things about this game.

Discrete objectives and rapidly-achievable victory conditions mean that the traditional Risk engine doesn't drag. Variable terrain presents new considerations -- certainly vs standard Risk, and frequently from game to game. Evolving player powers continually alter a group's established meta. I'm pre-sold on any Legacy game the designers publish from this point forward.

Oh, and then there's that pack you never open.

There is a lot of excitement over this game but I can't quite see it myself.  "Dude, it's still Risk" is my reaction. The innovations in this game are interesting and I won't deny that there is a certain thrill in rolling dice.  But the innovations can't cover up that this is still Risk and still involves rolling dice a lot.  I hope that someone takes the ideas here and build it onto a better foundation.

Risk++. If you like risk, or if you would like risk if it didn't take so long, or if risk is ruined for you because trading in troop cards makes it so that who wins comes completely down to timing, then you will like this.

RATING: 7
Once you get over the OCD driven knee-jerk reaction to the actual modification of the cards and board, it makes for a unique experience. Risk Legacy forces you to consider how your actions will impact future games, make the changing face of the landscape part of your strategy. For best results play with the same group of people, and over the course of 15+ games you will have a shared experience that actually becomes a metagame unto itself. Even the right to name cities and continents becomes a reward, a visible reminder of past conquests that both provide bonuses and rub salt in your enemies wounds.

I dream of playing this game every night, only after having played two games in of a 15-game series.  It has joined the ranks of Chess, Dominion, Nexus Ops and Here I Stand as the only games I rank a 9 or higher.

No spoilers.  The game has you play a series of risk games but after each game, you change the board or rules in some way.  There are real surprises in the game an the mechanics are more fun than regular Risk.  But at the end of the day, it is Risk.  If you have a group of 5 players, that will play  all 15 games and don't mind that it is Risk, I strongly recommend the game.  It is excellent.

Metagaming at its finest!  I am probably most excited that this concept may be applied to a better game than Risk, creating even more awesomeness.

[o]Copy of Risk Legacy:  $46.99

Ticket to BGG.Con:  $85.00

Gas money for trip to Dallas:  $74.39

Half cost of Hotel room for 5 nights:  $329.78

Attacking your friend from your HQ in China on the first turn of the sixth game because he places his Major City in Afghanistan after you placed yours in Mongolia and using 3 missiles in the attack so you can open that pack and finding out that you nuked your buddy and he nuked you, completely wiping out both armies, and there is nothing left protecting either of your HQ's so a third buddy walks in and wins the game on the first turn, but you don't care because there are MUTANTS!!!! and China is now a big FALLOUT zone and your friend's faction will forever more be known as THE BRINGER OF NUCLEAR FIRE!!!! (cue heavy metal music \m/ \m/):  DEFINITELY PRICELESS[/o]

After 11 more games at BGG.Con:  Wow, this game definitely does not disappoint.  Still have not seen two packs (World Capital and Do Not Open. Ever.)  Lots of drama packed in that box.  Replayability seems better than I expected, even knowing what is in the packs.  Can't wait to finish this world and the other two I've been playing.

After 5th game:  Drafting is a definite improvement.  It helps to keep things from getting completely unbalanced.  I am still interested to see how this will turn out...

Update after 4th game:  The early going is too much classic Risk strategy of turtling and then vaulting to a victory with a huge turn of conquering.  I think more mission and event cards would improve the game, so hoping that they do.  Just got drafting rules, which should also help things out a bit.  Still awaiting awesomeness...

Impression after first two games:  Risk without the mission cards is not nearly as fun.  Initial play is bland, but anticipation is great that it will get better.  The mod mechanic is super-cool.  Doesn't seem that important that the same 5 players play through all the games.  I like that the first winners have a disadvantage, but it is a big disadvantage.  I am thinking this will eventually be a 10 or a 1.  I'm hoping it doesn't end up being more like Risk: Fluxx than Risk Legacy.

The concept was cool originally, but Pandemic Legacy has shown some of this game's shortcomings.

Permanent changes to the board and game are still very cool, but giving players too much control over the pacing of the unlocks really causes things to go too quickly at first, and then drag as time goes on. It is hard to savor a game like this, even for the 15 initial play-throughs.

One of the most innovative designs in gaming in the past 10 years.  A ton of fun, and a slap in the face reminder that we should be playing games to create experiences that we remember forever. 

Hands down the best version of risk ever made and a classic example of everything Ameritrash.

8.0 - May 2014 - 4 Plays:  The BGG ranking system doesn't quite work for this game, however, I do really like it.  I'm very curious about how the game plays after you're no longer changing the board.

7.0 - Nov 2015 - 12 Plays:  This game can be hard to finish once plays start to be out of the running to with the campaign.  It suffers a bit from a runaway leader problem.

Wow, what a fun game!  The modifiers allow for a Risk like no other.  Can't wait to get this one back to the table to see if we can get some of those sealed packs open!

RATING: 10
One of the best games of all time.  Requires a massive amount of dedication to play: fifteen 1-3 hour long games.  But the decisions you make in earlier games effect the games in the future.  It's cruel.  It's brutal at times.  It's awesome.

I own several copies of this game.  Kind of genius from the gamemaker's perspective:  They got me to buy three copies of the same game.  I'm buying into their goldmine.

Have a copy were the stickers can't be taken of the card without severly damaging them. Game is unplayable at this time. Got a replacement set but same problem. Watch out with buying because it seems like this problem exist everywhere because of degrading paper and very sticky sticker glue.

RATING: 9
This is an amazing game and an amazing experience. Even if the bloom comes off the rose after 15 plays, a) that's a ton of plays, b) we'll have a story in a box that's unique to our group, and c) we'll have had a blast getting there.

It takes the core of Risk, tweaks it in interesting ways, and makes every turn a packed bundle of interesting decisions, tension, and gambles. The dynamic aspects of the game as a physical object are a hoot, and something every gamer -- Risk fan or not -- should experience at least once. Tearing up that first card was hard, but by the end of the first game we were angling for ways to maximize the changes we wrought on Earth 1783.

This is the most enjoyable version of Risk I've ever played, a risk for Hasbro as a publisher, and a truly singular experience. Losing is enjoyable, it's addictive, and it makes me look at boardgaming in a different way. Fascinating and utterly unique.

I gave my copy to a friend because I was moving, and playing it with another group would just feel weird. I like it so much that I might buy it again to start fresh.

Groundbreaking in theory; a whole ton of fun in practice. I've still yet to finish a whole campaign though so maybe after the 15 games that complete the cycle, I'll be done and never want to touch it again. That said, those 15 games are going to be some amazing gaming and are well worth the effort/time/money.

The most startlingly fresh and original design I've seen in years of gaming. Every session is thrilling and memorable.

Much of the core of this game is similar to classic Risk (which isn't a bad game) but the evolving campaign elements make it a great deal better. While I haven't played through the full thing yet the use of envelopes of new rules that are only opened when certain criteria are met keep it fresh and interesting. While it can technically only be used once you still get your money's worth from the entertainment it provides.

This game is just not great.  I'm not the biggest risk fan out there, in fact I've only ever played a few risk games in my time.  The randomness and luck factors throw things off for me.  The game itself seems to have some flaws IMO.  


It seems that the event cards are in place to perhaps speed up the game and help whoever is ahead.  There is little to no catchup mechanism.  Giving 5 troops to whoever has the highest population makes sense thematically, but for us we seemed to have this happen a ton!  Why couldn't they have cards that give them to the lowest population?  Call it an uprising card.  

We also didn't get to open the alien box until the second to last game.  We also only did this by 'cheating' because the player who placed  30 troops didn't have a missile card left.  The group (5 of us) decided it would be lame to not get to open the box and have a chance at playing the aliens.  In the last round we were all just ready for the game to be over, so we decided to not even try playing the aliens.

Factions that got bonuses early on were super powerful and kept winning, while factions that didn't get bonuses got stuck and rarely won, if ever.

We finished the game because we started it, and the group felt like they had an obligation to see it to its end.  But the last 5 games or so it was definitely a drag.  

Perhaps this would've been better if we all enjoyed risk, one of our players was a big fan of Risk and played it a ton while serving in the army.  He started out really enjoying it but by the 15th game he was not a fan of the rules.  He played a lot of Risk 2210AD and preferred that system much more, I have only played one game of that, and Risk just isn't for me.  

I love the legacy concept, and I really wanted to love this version of Risk, but unfortunately I think these kinds of mechanics are just not for me.

RATING: 5
Much better than regular Risk. It's fun to open packets and make changes to the board, but some things are way too hard to trigger, at least with our legacy. We've taken to forcing things to happen so we don't get too bored. I'll be happy with our 15th and final game is complete and the emperor is crowned. I don't think we'll play it much after that, at least not without resistance from me. The idea of permanently changing the game and every world turning out different is very interesting and original, though. The quality of the cards and especially the stickers is horrible!

RATING: 4
Risk is a horrible game. The legacy system is fantastic thus i wanted to give this game a try. After 8 games of Risk Legacy i'm waiting the thing to be over mainly because i loathe how Risk plays in general..

Does the legacy system make risk better though ? Yes it does.
The games are faster because you don't have to kill everyone to win the game. There are also some special rules that make the game more interesting, but saying what they are might be spoilers, so i leave it at that.

It's like Risk, but if you add a new house rule after each game. Each rule makes things better or more interesting. There's still all the political stuff that's in normal risk, but there is more room for player skill, even though random silly stuff happens every now and then.

I guess I have to eat my hat. On game 11, we finally had to play through to elimination. I managed to gamble on the long game and win. South America is truly a fortress.

I've always liked risk, but for me this brought the game to a whole new level. I played this game to completion (all 15 games) within a 4 player group over the course of roughly 7-9 sessions.

I would do this again at any time within a group of 4-5 "committed" players. We could split the cost of the game, and the winner can keep it at the end.

Brian's copy

Started out fun - quicker breezier version of the old risk that feels invigorated. But 6 games in it morphs into something else all together. Games end up being 15-20 minutes with very little chance to strategize or even have more than 2 or 3 turns before the game is over - the 4 red stars you need to win become increasingly easier to get with the mission cards. Good idea but falls apart the deeper you play the game...almost to the point of being broken in some way that I can't quite put my finger on.

I may change this rating after the "15 plays", but first impressions were incredibly positive.  I loved the fact that every decision I made had the potential to change the game PERMANENTLY.

As a game, Risk is pretty blah, "shortened playtime" or no.  As a ritual of narrative worldbuilding with excitable friends? Absolutely marvellous.

RATING: 7
I really didn't know what to expect here when we started setting this up. I mean... it's Risk, and while I have fond memories of it from my high school days, I also remember really feeling frustrated when my 30 unit army was wiped out because of unlucky dice rolls. And while that is still a possibility, there's enough other stuff going on here that it doesn't seem to matter. While playing I heard my friends say things like , "This is the greatest game of Risk I have ever played!" or "This feels more like high stakes poker than Risk!" and that alone should speak to the strength of this new game. But why is all of this the case? It's the fact that victory now means more than what it means in any other game - that something, indeed something significant is actually at stake with each and every session of this game. The lasting effects that the victor and those who hung on get to choose each match mean that this game has more in common with human history than any board game I've ever played, and yet it is complete science fiction. How wonderful and strange.

----------------------

Having played 12 of the 18 games of this, it's starting to show its tarnish. First, it's still Risk, with all of its flaws - bad luck can ruin good strategy, runaway leaders are still a problem, and no amount of clever narrative is going to fix that. Furthermore, in our 12 games we've begun to realize that players seem more interested in making choices that will trigger envelope openings rather than playing well and being competitive, which means we've seen some dumb easy victories and/or kingmakings that happen within ten minutes of setup. I love that there is an opportunity for the game to evolve, but I wish the circumstances that triggered the evolution remained a secret until triggered. I never thought I'd hear myself say this, but I want more game and less metagame here.

I rated it a 1 for being broken.  I despise the idea of a disposable game.  The game could easily have been made to not be disposable with virtually the same gameplay.  The game requires the same play group, and if you fail to do so parts of the game become blatantly unbalanced.  The modifications to the game can cause it to make the game horribly imbalanced and broken.  I also hate that some versions of the game have different components than others.

I like the theme and many of the ideas in the game.  If the game wasn't disposable and instead had everything in it now but non-disposable (so stickers would be cardboard tokens or a deck of powers) I would probably like the game (assuming there was a balanced way to place the components).

UPDATE: After two games, can't say I'm a fan. Maybe I just hate fun. But the game has a slow, brittle start in which the fun comes more from the un-lockables than the play itself.

Bonus points for having a board that gets physically altered through play. Cool idea. 

Also fixes several problems with Risk and makes it a much more solid game. The introduction of headquarters does change the focus from world domination to capture, but it's a good change. 

I haven't played it until the end, so can't comment on how the game is in its final stages.

At least it is designed to end quickly. On the surface, the novelty of opening packages and writing on the board is an interesting draw and incentive to keep playing - which I assure you - the game play itself is not.

Under the gimmick lies Risk and essentially all of the faults with that aged game design: Bash the leader, snowballing (across games!), brain dead random combat with no to few interesting decisions and player crippling... The unlocks have served to only entice my game group to desire to play Risk Legacy more to see what else lies in wait, and I can tell them- more Risk. If you seek anything more than the novelty of these unlocks, wait for more interesting implementations of the concept. Not Recommended.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is Risk like it hasn't been played b before. Up front the game is more engaging than in any other format I have played it and that is due to the inclusion of a  short term VP target, which helps keep the game to a good time frame and makes almost every decision very important. 

Add to that the fact that the game evolves over 16 plays or so and there are secrets to unlock based on the actions of the players and this version is a really engaging time. 

Want to play a game where the world in which you play is altered by the decisions of the players? Want to play a game where the factions in the world will develop their own narrative based on their history and your performance? 

Then this is the game for you. Only downside is that elements of the game will be permanently altered and sometimes destroyed. If you aren't cool with that then beware. 

For me though, the experience and the enjoyment of the game along its path to fulfilment is well worth the price of admission.

This is memorable gaming...the best kind there is.

WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS IN THESE COMMENTS!

One game down so far. This is most definitely Risk, but it was a little surprising how well the basic rules hold up. Almost got to open a sealed envelope after the first game due to one person almost being eliminated. They ended up camping in one territory though. I'm interested to see how this game unfolds, though I guess the fact that the game no longer changes after the 15th session is a little odd. Part of me is hoping that the game allows for further changes after that session. At least, aside from ripping up territory cards. I'm excited to try again though. The one problem with the first session was getting enough reinforcements on the board, and I'm thinking that as time goes on it will be easier to remedy this.

-------

8 games in, and this is actually really fun! If anything, I feel like games are over a little too quickly at this point. The board is quite a bit different from where it started. Australia and Africa are now connected, and the alien island appeared in the Atlantic, connecting Brazil and England. I am a little annoyed, however, that in opening the box for using 3 missiles I got the reward for placing 30+ troops on the board. I'm not sure if this was a mistake in packaging, as I haven't opened the 30+ troop box yet (UPDATE: Yes, manufacturing error. Box labels were somehow switched), so I can't really check until then. I'm still enjoying the game, though I'm starting to wonder if it will run out of steam by the end. I have two boxes left, the other being placing the world capital on the board, and I have a feeling that there won't be much left to see after 3 or 4 more games. Still enjoy this quite a bit though, and I'm looking forward to continuing the campaign.

---

After game 11, everything has been opened and unlocked. Looking forward to coasting towards the end, as the only things that will change now are coins on cards, names of continents, and possible destroyed cards. What a great game. Just wish there was something to look forward to at the end of the 15th session.

3/5 of the peopleallied together and just farmed cards until they got enough. the other 2 players couldn't even scratch them since they took both americas, afirca, and europe and wouldn't fight with one another, and then one of them won.

Ultimately still Risk. Can't wait for the Legacy features to be attached to a better game.

Edit - Now that Pandemic Legacy is out and has (to my shock) risen to the #1 spot of BGG, I have to revise my judgement. I don't want the Legacy mechanic. It is built to please the zeitgeist of BoardGameGeek: people with enough disposable income and free time with relatives/friends to play a lot of boardgames a lot of times. The reality is that tearing cards apart is fun the first two times, then it becomes a costly gimmick. What I'd like is a campaign system that is resettable (not one I have to rebuy for each group I play it with) and where the permanent changes are player-driven (where Risk Legacy actually succeeds) rather than scripted.

Up there with marriage and birth of my child in the "Best Things to Ever Happen to Me" category.  I have been a Risk fanatic since I was 10 years old.  This game was simply amazing.  I've played through twice and almost made it through a third when players moved away.  I'm completely addicted to Legacy games.  I love how the stakes seem that much higher when actions and results carry on from game to game.  Can't get enough of the surprises that are unlocked along the way.  Now if Rob could just crank these babies out 2 a year or so, I'd never complain about anything in life ever again.

Love Pandemic Legacy.  Hate Risk Legacy (and I generally love Risk games). The game feels like the first Legacy style game.

9 out of 10 times the game's winner was decided by the initial dice roll to see who goes/drafts first. The events are so random that there's no way to prepare for them and usually ends up crippling the affected player.

After a certain point, I just didn't care about the game.

I do not like Risk but this version is brilliant. For me it is a bit of a one shot because i love the developement of the game more than the game "Risk", but the idea of this version rocks.

Only one play in so far, but wow what a great concept.  I don't want to give anything away, so I'll simply say that it's still Risk.  If you don't like Risk you probably won't like this, but if you do like Risk then you're in for a treat.  You'll want to make this an event game where you play with the same group every time.  The customization / changing of the board and game rules is genius.  My group of players can't wait to see what happens next!

Like many others, I bought it for the Legacy part, not the Risk part.

We have unlocked everything and seen everything there is to see, so my motivation to keep going is almost nil.

Crappy components. Runaway winner mechanic. Basically there's always a conversation that we need to pick on last game's winner, but no one wants to give up their chance at winning to do so.

Just 6 months before this game was announced I was joking with a friend that they need to devise a board game that destroyed itself after every play.  I believe the concept we settled on was "The Great Fire of London" where you actually set fire to the board and watch it spread (talk about an authentic fire-spreading mechanic!)  Of course, this also meant that the game had to be SO GOOD that people would just keep purchasing the game again and again.  

And then suddenly, someone actually put a product like this on the market!

Kudos for having the guts to market such a game.  After all, you don't have to expand the number of players buying the game if they have to keep buying it again and again.

Will I be purchasing this game?  Absolutely not.  Partly because its Risk, but also partly because I won't fall into this CCG-esque trap that's being created here.  I like my boardgames to be an investment that keeps rewarding me with enjoyment, not something that keeps sending me bills.

Zooms straight into a personal Top 5 as far as sheer fun is concerned. You HAVE to roleplay the whole thing and make up abusive little subplots in order to detract from the tedium of dice-rolling. But, bigods, when you get five people together who can do it well, what a summer you can have.

[b]Further thoughts:[/b] Hmmm. This is starting to grow old quick. The games are starting to drag out longer, it's difficult to come back from behind (doesn't help I haven't won any of the first five), and the dice-rolling gets tiresome. But then dice-rolling always has for me. Down from 8.5 to 7.

The metagame is brilliant while the gameplay is "just" great. Turtling is not a viable strategy as in Revised Risk. I'm also starting to "get" just how eye-opening the concept of permanence is in this game. It eliminates all sorts of problems and gives players a whole new wonderful course of strategy to chew on.

The meta-gaming element just adds a whole other level and subtly fixes some of the problems with classic Risk. Even if I get knocked out of the running for first place early on, I can ensure those who are in the lead or who are gaining on me in total games won over the campaign don't win, or go for a power, or try to trigger cool events or packets, and the list goes on. Brilliance.

The best RISK ever. Every boardgamegroup should try this one (and try not to fight IRL after).
Have to play this one correctly, thought:
1) HAVE a stable group of 5.
2) Everyone drops 1/5 of game price from their wallets.
3) Print "bonus cards exp" - you will need them in the last 6-7 games.
4) Play WITH that group all 15 games.
5) The winner claims the game as his own.

With that simple rules you will have your FUN maximized.

RATING: 8
This fixes so many things that were a nuisance in Risk while keeping the core of the game alive. Without going into details, the game is shorter and ends after the winner achieves certain objectives or points, rather than having to conquer the entire world. This keeps the game at 45-60 minutes. Each player that survives the game then gets to modify the board in some manner after that round. So everyone feels like they managed to do something in a round rather than simply waiting for annihilation.

What a great idea for a game!  The designers and Hasbro have got to be applauded for taking a risk on something genuinely new to board games.  The game itself is standard RISK with a lot of bells and whistles added on.  It's the permanent evolutionary changes that really make the game.  Don't wuss out and find ways to make the changes reversable - if you're gonna play this, play it properly!

I want this...but have absolutely no way of getting even three people together for 15 games of it, let alone a more satisfying 4 or 5.  Debating buying it and storing for a long while.  Worried it will go permanently out of print.  

I love Risk 2210, and I have managed to play 5 games or so in the 8 yrs I have known my brother-in-law who owns it.  I have not gotten 15 plays of some of my 10 rated games in 3-4 years of owning them.  Getting 15 Risk plays with an exciting board, the fun of naming things, the surprises, the laughs...I will have no problem writing on the board, etc. when the time comes.  Gaming is not an "investment" in items to me--just an investment in fun.

RATING: 7
Finding a group who will stick with this until the end is vital to the game and you probably want a full 5 players.  The legacy parts of the game are simply amazing, it really adds to the story and campaign feeling.  The downside is that Risk isn't a great game to begin with, very random with not a lot of decision making.  However you can get past that with the right group of people.

Risk is a pretty average "dice rolling contest" rather than a game. But I like how the races, the rules, and the board itself alters with each game. It then feels like each subsequent game is a scenario rather than the same ol', same ol', and scenarios always drive new interest. Meaning we'll play this through. But in the end it's still Risk, with a healthy requirement for prayer to the dice gods, and a Risk rating can only get so high.

2011 - Stickers have been placed, board has been written on, and cards have been torn up. Awesome game at the start, but I'm realizing my interest has been in opening the packs and writing on the board.  Once the packs are all open, this is just another variant of Risk.  This will then only see maybe one play a year (similar to how often we play Risk 2210)

2014 - It has been three years since our last plays. This was sufficient enough time to make this rather enjoyable again. I suspect it helped that we weren't concerned with opening packs. It also helped that we weren't playing some long, grand strategy and instead attacked as opportunities presented themselves, even if it left some territories open to counter-attacks.

Bought it for my brother because we loved Risk.

Only problem we want to play it with certain people in order to enjoy it. Beeing peaky won't help casual gamers that don't have a standard gaming group.

It's a precious gem. We'll finish it in ten years if we have to but we will do it our way.

Name cities and make irreversible chooices. My God what else can you ask.

As an adult I respect that the designer tried to restrict the playing time. (In the original Risk we could be playing for 5 hours and still see no ending in the horizon)

The rewards for winning are quite enticing and have spurred a lot of competition in my group.

6 games in, this game is turning out to provide some of the most memorable and fun gaming experiences I've ever had. 

I initially subbed in for missing players on Josh's board in game 8, 14 & 15. Very impressed.

You can't really call this "Risk". Yeah, the combat and some of the mechanics are the same, but this is not just "Risk".

Pivotal events can happen beyond control that will change the course of the game. You need to accept that.

It would be great to play this through with the same people from game 1 through 15.

Well done, designers...well done.

Most of the Risk rules are the same but now the board and factions are altered as you play through the game. The games are shorter as you start in just one location and work your way across the board but you are often left very thin and since you only need four points to win it is often possible to steal a victory with a fairly small army. If you don't like Risk this won't change your mind.

Let me preface this review by saying I hate Risk. The seemingly endless, dice-fest that is classic risk pretty much ruined my opinion of boardgames as a teenager. 
As such, Risk Legacy has me torn. The constantly changing world/gameplay is an awesome feature - one of the coolest ideas I've seen in a game. 
On the other hand, it still feels a little too much like risk for me. Some problems have been fixed (game length), some problems remain (the dominant Austrailia strategy), and some new problems rear their head (unbalanced factions). Overall, some great ideas that I would love to see built on a stronger foundation.

Not sure if I should grade this 10 as we pull it out to play at every opportunity.
Basic Risk is grade 5 at best.  We are 12 games into our Risk Legacy campaign and if we froze the game at this point then it would be grade 7.  But it is the evolving legacy aspect that makes this game so rewarding.  Every week a new challenge and the strategic possibilities seem to be constantly shifting.  In the most recent game, we each (all three of us) seemed to be winning at some point and it was only a lucky sprint to the finish (leaving me horribly vulnerable) that allowed me to snatch victory.  So every game in the campaign is a grade 10 and the 9 is only because this constant evolution has at some point to slow down.  I have thought more about this game between our weekly sessions than any other that I can remember.
Oh, and we love euros in our group too, but sometimes, after a hard day at work, you can't beat a bit of world domination.

I have a group of friends who own this game, and I've been lucky enough to play 8 or so games with them. Although far more complicated than traditional Risk--resulting in a fair amount of initial ramp up time when first learning the rules--it ultimately captures all of fun of conquest of the original in a far more streamlined manner. I've had a total blast playing an extended 'campaign' with my group of friends, and highly recommend this game. I do have two small issues with prevent me from giving it a higher score.

The first is that you are "technically" only supposed to play 15 games per copy... afterwards you are meant to purchase a fresh set. Although I understand many of the reasons why (after 15 games, there likely won't be many more stickers that you can continue to place on the board... the world will more or less be stuck in place), it still seems like a little bit of a way to simply push more copies.

The second is that there is a little bit of a 'rich get richer' positive feedback loop -- every time someone wins, they gain special tokens that give them a little more power in future games. Although this does make winning an individual game feel more substantial, it has the effect of making old winners more likely to win future games as well. The game admittedly does try to mitigate this a little bit (those who are playing who have never won a game are given a victory token which gives them a substantial lead in the game), and theoretically all of the 'losers' could band together against the 'winner' to take him down. In practice, I find that players enjoy making alliances that benefit them locally in the current game, even if that means siding with the "winner," only to be cut down by the game's end.

Other than those two very minor complaints, I love them game tremendously. Any fan of Risk should definitely make the effort to play this game!

Not the BEST game of all time (that's Cosmic Encounter) but this is my favorite.  

Over the course of 15 games this game gave me memories that no other game has ever given me.

So what if it is built on the basic "Risk engine".  This game goes far beyond that and besides, risk gets an unwarranted amount of hate around here.  

We still break out this game occasionally with the original group - so it has seen more than 15 plays.  

And I have another copy ready for the next group.

A really brilliant idea, from start to finish.  It is an extremely well-designed twist on an old classic, and I find myself constantly excited to play the next round.

I haven't had this much fun in a game in quite a while, or had this much anticipation until I could play again.  Kudos to everyone who designed this one.  I've already bought several extra copies to play again and again.

RATING: 8
8 - I loved it while my group played it, the shorter play length thanks to the missions and victory points (Red Stars) made sure we didn't get sick of the thing after 1 session (as usually happens with risk).

This is the version of risk I have played probably the most, as I know for a fact my group played 15 games in 15 (almost) straight weeks (we took one week off for the super bowl).  After the thrill of unlocking things and signing the board, and adding to the world wore off however it hasn't made another appearance, though we've talked often about doing at least one more.  Unfortunately due to some rule oversights we horribly unbalanced the world mostly due to the rule about losing troops when entering an unoccupied city.

Whether we play it again sometime soon or not I'm looking forward to seafall.

I really want to like this game because the idea of a persistent board game with lasting changes is really neat, but at the end of the day this game is still Risk. Its frustrating to see a masterfully crafted plan for global domination get squashed by a few bad dice rolls. I have played 4 games so far (and unlocked 2 envelopes) and its enough to keep me interested, but it could be so much more. 

I hope to see more "legacy" war games.

Definitely a fun experience - sure, it's still risk with all it's ups and downs, but the slight shaking I get from permanently changing the world and knowing my choices affect the world is a feeling I've never had in a boardgame before.

I grew up playing RISK, but for the most part had moved away from playing it.  As a group we might have gotten it to the table once a year.  When I heard about Risk: Legacy I was really intrigued and convinced my group to give it a try.  

It was such a great experience that we ended up buying a second copy and playing through another 15 games.  Luckily we had a stable group and at the time we were getting together at least once a week, if not twice.  It definitely is a fun game and watching it evolve is enjoyable.

Having said that, you really need a core group of players invested into playing it.  I don't think the experience would be the same if you had individuals changing out.  Not that it can't be done, but I think it would lose a little bit of what makes it great.

There is simply no other game, anywhere, like it. It is singular. Such a great gaming experience. I don't know how you could play it and not have a great time.

The only ONLY thing that makes it challenging is finding a group that can play fifteen times together, since so many of the in-game effects are awarded to players by name. But if you can do it, you are in for one hell of a good time.

Finished our game. Took five sessions over six months. 

The tweaks to basic Risk were welcome, and made the games play out quickly (some took only 20 minutes). However, they could have gone farther. You don't have long games, or big empires, so the scale for the reinforcements at the beginning of the turn (3 for 1-11 territories, 4 for 12-14 territories, etc.) doesn't work. I don't think anyone got more than 4 reinforcements in any of our 15 games. I assume the cities are supposed to help with the small populations, but they don't help much. In fact, the cities are a drain on manpower - I'd guess the amount of armies we lost to moving into cities in the game was well over 100, while the armies recruited due to the population bonus was less than 20. So cities are not a good thing. Which is not a huge deal, but something of a head scratcher. 

The best part of the game, of course, is opening the new packets. They come at just the right tempo, and introduce genuine changes to the game just as it might be getting stale. And they're fun. The new rules are fun. The new factions are fun. The new events are fun. The progress of the 15 game saga is satisfying and very well thought out.

As far as an exercises in competitive gaming, Risk Legacy has two pretty big issues: 

1) Once you get some territory cards with a bunch of coins on them, the timing of those cards coming out has a huge impact on the game. When cashing in a set of a territory cards with 7 coins on them will often win you the game, a card with 4 coins appearing on the array at the right time is a massive windfall. 

2) By the final five or so game, the meta-game is king. Decisions are driven by who is leading in the overall game, and playing kingmaker is unavoidable. This can be a feature or bug, depending on how you like metagaming. We're okay with it, but it does become a big part of the endgame. 

Criticisms aside, the game has a fun-factor that's hard to beat. It's a game for people who love trash-talk at the table and can laugh at crazy in-game situations or runs of luck.

RATING: 6
I haven't played a new game for a while and I haven't played Risk in a long time. This, which is a reinvention of the original game, has some interesting ideas though they are not as original as the designers think, or as well implemented.
The main problem with the idea of a gradually evolving game (other than living card games being there first) is that it is tied to an underlying game structure which is fairly basic by modern standards. And it has been done by designers without much knowledge of CCGs and aimed at players with little knowledge of gaming. In my first game there was an obvious timing issue of huge importance which the rules simply didn't have any allowance for and at least one of the players in the game could not see the issue.
This will play well with a family group (but there will be some arguments) and it might be distracting for a gamer group looking for a light campaign game.

Owned now by the CERN games club.

This is a great game. I like it more every time I play. You get to change the game, while playing it. I mean change it PERMANENTLY! Your game is terrifically unlikely to look like anybody else's. We're just flabberghasted when certain events happen.

2-5 players, great with 3, 4 or 5. Completely different depending on the number of players. 90 mins not including rules explanation.

The problem is, you might accidentally completely screw the game over with stupid sticker placement.

I love AmeriTrash, and this game defines the genre. The game changes from play to play, and an interesting storyline develops. Old school Risk took ages to play, but this one uses a victory point system: 4 points and you win. You get points be capturing enemy HQ's and satisfying missions. It is hella fun to make a deal with someone, then recognize an easy path to victory that no one else has noticed, then backstab your buddy and snap up a quick couple VP's in a single turn, suddenly ending the game. I throw in copious amounts of trash talk as well. Of course, the same happens to you later in the campaign by someone else so it's all good.

A playable version of Risk, lovely! The legacy system: mindblowing!!! 

But ...

Playing this alongside Pandemic Legacy, it shows that the idea of all the packages being triggered by specific events instead of in a planned order between games leaves you with the risk, that everything triggers almost at once, and that you only get to play with some of the most radical aditions for just a few games. 

My group has finished 12 games, and we are still to open two packages - one of them being a major one. Not optimal.

There is a lot of stuff to look for in the begining, and if you had introduced some of it game by game (powers, events, scars, missions, homeland, etc.) would have made it more digestable and give a better sence of developement. And then maybe let the two biggest boxes have variable triggers.

Playing this in 2016, you see the progres from Risk Legacy to Pandemic Legacy, but it's still a game worth playing, if you have a history playing classic (broken!) Risk. If you don't like luck and dice in your games, the legacy system won't change that.

Go into this blind makes it a lot more fun.  As with classic Risk, however, the person controlling Australia holds a distinct advantage.  There are lots of elements to counter this, but in our particular playthrough, I happened to win when most of those elements were introduced (SPOILERS:  I got to place all of the extra sea routes, and other players placed biohazards nearby to counter me and then my major city got nuked - however, the Mutants appearing coupled with the proximity of the biohazards makes it a nearly impossible advantage to overcome END SPOILERS).  I also wish there could have been some additional combat units introduced, but those are my only real complaints.

RATING: 7
I don't like regular Risk but this is fairly fun so far. I really hate how it's very difficult to win until everyone has won at least. I won the first game with our group and every game since has been an uphill battle. I can't wait until everyone has won. 

Rating may increase with new rules.

Update: After our 2nd session, I hate this game. The new rules are making it even more random. Also, when certain rules triggered it randomly decided a winner in one of our games... I really don't like that. 

The events are too random. Some events are positive but some are negative so if all of the positive events happen for one player he'll win. Some even give out VP and if those come at the right time that player randomly gets a VP. Once a player gets eliminated from a game he can keep coming back on the board anywhere and play kingmaker for the game. The missions are dumb, they're way too hard to accomplish. Being able to start anywhere on the board encourages an all-in type approach early game. Since you can start on someone's doorstep you can try to take over their capital at the beginning. You will either have a big advantage or be eliminated from the game (usually taking them out of the game as well). 

Update: It seems the games are hit and miss. As long as people don't play too aggressively at the start it can be quite a bit of fun.

highly innovative, but it's still risk.  You basically get to play a bunch of different risk variants, and variety somewhat makes up for depth.  Mostly I felt it actually didn't go far enough on the legacy part, and successive games are too much like each other.

01-01-2015. Rated after 15 plays. Thank god it's over. Don't get me wrong, but we played Risk 15 times the last year and it's NOT my favorite game. The game was incredibly interesting and fun, the experience was fantastic. But I'll never play it again :P.

18-06-2014. Rated after 9 plays. I still like the game. I must say, the game slows down a little more. Would have preferred shorter games I think.

Legacy aspect remains really cool.

12-02-2014. WOW. Surprise hit for me. I didn't expect to like risk, but this design REALLY tightens and streamlines the game up considerably, making it a fun area-control game. 

Some rules I don't get completely (how the hell do I get the cards?), but the rest of the game is super. The legacy idea is cool, but it feels so weird to tear up stuff you own. I cannot see me doing it more often.

It's still Risk, with a ton of dice-rolling randomness, but games can go pretty fast and there's a nice mix of encouraging attacking to get cards and spreading yourself thin to get continent bonuses while making sure your fortress(es) is not too poorly defended and within grasp of another player.  My son liked it so much (playing the 2nd game of a friend's copy) that I look forward to buying it to play it through with him and the rest of my family and/or some of his friends.

Note that unlike Pandemic Legacy that works perfectly fine if different players play different months, Risk Legacy seems to be designed for the same group of players to play through all the games together.

There are several aspects of this game that I hope to see in future designs:

1) For Risk specifically, customizable factions, the starting rules, a redesigned resource system, and the possibility of new maps. I would happily pay for "expansions" that came with non-Earth maps and new scars/unlocks.

2) For other games: built-in expansions for a campaign style game. Whether permanently modified or not, this is just absolutely phenomenal.

My opinion of this game has improved over the course of the campaign. This is not usually my style of game and I have to be in the right headspace when I start playing, but there's something here that reminds me of being a little boy. There is so much destruction and this amplifies as the campaign progresses. Plus, the giddiness of opening those new packs reminds me of getting presents as a child.

I don't know that I would want to play this type of game in any specific state over and over again. It's just too chaotic, but the ever-shifting nature keeps giving you new things to play with and think about just before the luster of the current state wears off. Therefore, I think the campaign concept of this game is a perfect way for me to enjoy this.

One of my favorite game. I immediately fell in love with the excitement of the Legacy mechanic and look forward to playing more games like this one.
While i enjoy the basic Risk gameplay, it can get a bit tedious at times. Legacy for me is even at its starting setup a better and more manageable game and only gets better and better along the way.
I especially love the inclusion of factions and faction bases, while streamlining the initial win conditions.

[q="RobDaviau"]The design started with an attempt to make a game decision matter, to up the ante, to maybe make you sweat a bit before you do something. We all make plenty of decisions every day. Many are meaningless. Some stay with us forever. We all have the girl (or boy) who got away, the job we should or shouldn’t have taken, the night out that ended badly, the girl (or boy) we should’ve let get away. We can move on from these or try to atone or learn from them or even enjoy who we are because of them, but there’s one thing we can’t do: we can’t take them back. There are no do overs in life. Some decisions just make you who you are.[/q]

Another one of these threads back from the dead, eh? :D

I should mention that, after playing Tide of Iron, you *don't* need to destroy components (or gamble, or lose a card, like Magic used to) to "make you sweat a bit". If you have critical units (or resources, as in Revolution) that you risk losing, that adds quite a bit of tension. Heck, in a good Eurogame, nearly every decision is an opportunity risk, and the tension of knowing that you must make *every* decision correctly adds tension to the game.

Finally, of course, Risk Legacy would work even better as a computer game. Not only could you reset the game after 15 games, but new content ("sealed stuff") could be added to the game -- for only a small fee!

:thumbsup: The ‘OG’ Legacy game. The sense of discovery entices curiosity.
:thumbsup: Better victory conditions than the classic [b]Risk[/b] I know. You have to collect a certain amount of victory stars, which ensures the game is over before it can outstay its welcome. During the course of of the Legacy campaign, you unlock more ways to gain these victory stars.
:thumbsup: Unlike (what I’ve heard) about other Legacy games out there, this game’s Legacy part ends in a unique and playable copy of Risk.

----

:thumbsdown: This is just as much the players’ fault, but the conditions to open the different packages can steer strategies towards opening them rather than playing to win the game. Which I find to be less fun than the story-driven (e.g. [thing=161936][/thing]) or organic (e.g. [thing=197376][/thing]) unlocking of new elements in more recent Legacy games.
:thumbsdown: The combat system of classic [b]Risk[/b] is retained in this game, and so are the crazy swings of luck.

It plays very fast, and putting your own mark on the board really draws you into the game. The campaign aspect, such as wether to put a minor city in a certain space or not (because it might be good now, but bad later) is a new dimension. It's very interesting to see the game develop incrimentally by the additions to the board and the booster packs (which you definitely want to open). Part of the charm is to tear up the old stuff. It's like a forbidden pleasure to actually destroy invalid game material.

This game gets played automatically. I started with a group of 5 friends which expanded to 6 friends, and haven't looked back. I don't know why i was worried it wouldn't get played, I get a phone call or text every week asking when the next game is? The discovery is part of the fun, but if I get 15 sessions or more out of this game (Which I am definitely on track to do) then I will be very happy!

[1 play] Regular Risk is not something I'm interested to play anymore, but I would play it with my kids. Fortunately, Risk Legacy offers something even more.

I think Pandemic Legacy is a superior game, but what do I know, this game has barely evolved yet? I have solid hopes thta it will become more interesting, and the kids are eager to play again. So, it deserves an 8 for now.

It's still Risk, with the generic blandness and lack of detail that goes with it (mostly, it should be noted, at the beginning of the campaign), but the notion of shaping gameplay and components along repeated plays does deserve a distinction.

Unopened copy ... waiting for the right time

Having played another copy through with friends, I found this game to be incredibly creative and a wonderful surprise.  We fought hard every week to sign the board and the changes to the world as we fought through 15 games made it fresh constantly - Everyone was always excited to play even after playing for months once a week.

I hope that Rob Daviau is planning something to continue this wonderful idea !

[Remember, all Legacy boards should be played with more-or-less the same people for 10-15 games, because the board (world) changes permanently and whoever wins the most games wins the board.  That's a big commitment!]

The fundamental crippling flaw of any Risk game is the use of dice.  Balls, man.  How many times have I seen a single troop last out against an invading horde simply because that defensive troop kept rolling high numbers?  Risk loses a lot of its strategic value due to the reliance on dice for all of the big actions.

Here's where the Legacy board mostly subverts that issue: opportunity.  From scars that permanently change the board (making some land uninhabitable, etc.), to the use of "missiles" (nukes) which can change dice rolls, to new events that can change the course of the game in fun ways rather than frustrating ones, to shields and turrets that give bonuses, to different perks from various factions, to rule changes in the middle of the game, the Legacy game truly turns Risk into a better, fuller, more engaging and dynamic game.

While adding all of those rules and new options massively improves the game, they also offer their own downsides, mainly in the realms of rule interpretation, prep time, and the learning curve.  All of those stereotypes about Risk ruining friendships?  Yeah, that kind of goes double for this one... if you have a lot of sore losers in your gaming group -- people who are overly competitive and shut down when they're losing or they perceive they're being unfairly attacked -- you definitely need to prepare for that before committing to the 10-15 games that this requires.  I'd make copies of the whole rule book for each of your players, and have them read it ahead of time.  When new rules come up (as part of the Legacy opportunities), don't just move on with play.  Instead, talk about how the rule will change the play, and make sure everyone agrees with the interpretation.

Okay, so yes, it is a complicated game with a steep learning curve and lots of opportunities for miscommunication.  But dude, it really is fun.  Using your perks strategically, forming unstable alliances, seeing the new things the Legacy board offers, getting giddy as you come from behind or dominate the world... I definitely enjoy it.

I think this game is evolutionary in our world of board gaming. And can't wait to see how other designers incorporate it.

Yeah, it's Risk, but a really cool version of Risk. The board doesn't start out fully populated, so there's more maneuverability, and then of course, there is the cool mechanic of customizing the game based upon who won or lost. I really enjoyed that aspect of my initial play and look forward to the narrative that we will generate with it. I'm not sure that how cool it is to play it after those initial plays, but we'll see.

Still working our way through the 15-game campaign.

Wow, what a great twist on Risk! Anyone who likes or liked Risk should play this game! I'm not sure that I'll want to play it after we complete our series, but you never know ...
-----
Finished!

The BEST version of Risk, bar none! However, I found the earlier games more fun, despite absolutely loving all the surprises along the way. Why? Because there wasn't a long game history to deal with. I prefer playing games without having to have a memory of previous games. Especially so when that brings about negotiations and dealmaking ... I HATE negotiation games! So despite loving the system, I'm less enamored of this just because I don't think I want to play a series of 15 games; I'd rather just play one (or maybe a few).

My rating is still pretty high, 'cause it's a damn fine game, but really I'm not sure I'd want to do it a second time.

This game has given me more of a roller-coaster ride than any other I've played.

I loved the concept and got five friends together to play approximately every other week.  The idea of unlocking new content for the game and an ever-changing, modifiable, and persistent board was really attractive to me.  And at first I loved it.  The unknown was exciting as we strove to unlock all the new content and every game was different than the one before with the scars and cities placed on the board.

As the game progressed though I slowly started to lose interest in the game and as I write this we are 2 games from the end of the campaign and I think I legitimately hate this game.

Once you've unlocked everything and placed all the stickers on the board the luster completely wears off and many games before that the imbalance in this game starts to show.  First of all, I've never seen a game with a bigger "rich get richer" problem.  The missile mechanic is stupid and rewards those who have won the most games in a campaign giving them a huge advantage.  A missile changes a die roll to a 6 which can, in the best of situations, turn a lose-two battle into a win-two.  Once you've accumulated 2+ wins over everyone else this gives you a huge advantage when used at the right time.

On top of that a couple of the factions are way more powerful than others, specifically one of the last ones that you unlock.  This makes the roll-off for first pick in the draft essentially a roll-off for winning the game.  Since the faction in question has been unlocked they have been involved in four and a half games and they've won four.  It's clear they are broken in design.

This coupled with the overwhelming luck that comes with the game make it not a good game that tricked me with the glamor and gleam of a persistent, ever-changing game world with unlockable goodies.  Now that I'm on the other side of the rabbit hole, though, I can see that what game you are left with has some serious problems.

Given away to the winner.

Ok, so I'll admit it - I really like this one. It's clever, creative, and totally original in the ways it differs from the standard board game. The idea of ripping up components alone is... revolutionary... honestly worth a play, or five.

That said, it's Risk. And without those extra bits, yes, it'd be incredibly stupid, and really nothing more than a dice roller.

I spent a lot of time playing Risk.  Then I spent a lot of time playing Risk variants.  I assumed that I was done until Risk Legacy came along.  It is hampered by the Risk engine, but it is so clever and innovative that it is still a blast to play.  I would say that it is endless fun, but it isn't.  It's 15 games of fun and that's just great.  Permanently modifying the game is a blast.

We play that everyone plays the same Empire from game to game(mostly, you'll see), but the game isn't really designed for that and that is my only critique of it other than the Risk Engine.

I can't wait for Seafall to come out, which will be the same concept but without the Risk engine.

This might seem like hyperbole, but it is clearly one of the 10 most innovative games in the thousands of years of board game design.  Biggest board game surprise of all time.

RATING: 3
Opening the packs are the only reason I can see to spend time playing the "game."  Risk has all of the randomness of a real wargame, with none of the ability to influence odds found in real wargames.  It's fundamentally a push your luck game with perhaps a modicum of strategy in terms of timing the push--although even that is based usually entirely on tactical considerations of the other players' turns.  We're only on our 6th game, so I'm in search of a pack that will add some interest to what is otherwise simply a complete waste of 90 minutes.

We've finished 8 games now.  There is one pack left to open.  The overall game has not improved of course, and some of the changes are actual changes that didn't need to be triggered by card-opening-events and should have been included from the start to help this sadly popular game. As a group we've decided to play just until we open the last card pack, then we can thankfully put the whole concept of Risk behind us hopefully for at least another 20 years again (we had all played in college).  

It'll just go in the garbage/recycle since it won't be tradeable, and I certainly have no reason to let it clog up my games storage.  That's a pretty good indicator of the game right there.

That said, the concept is VERY cool, and I think putting it in play in an actually *good* game would be astounding.  It's definitely not broken--and the designers should be commended for some great innovation and vaguely interesting balancing tricks.  But oh man, I will never play this again once we're done with the packs.

Writing this comment for my own reference so it contains spoilers.

Simple Risk-derived game notable for introducing the "legacy" branding for permanent modification of components. The core gameplay is simple dudes-on-a-map destruction, but enhanced by customizations small and large.

At the small end, minor changes are made to the board (such as the addition of new cities and fortification of others). More interesting is the faction customization: over the course of a campaign, factions unlock permanent bonuses and unique goals.

The major changes [COLOR=#000000][BGCOLOR=#000000]are the exciting ones. Being too trigger happy with the nukes earns the title "bringer of nuclear fire" and unlocks a sixth faction, the mutants. In a similar but much lamer twist, one player can be revealed as an alien sympathiser, adding yet another faction and permanently altering the board with the addition of an artificial alien island.[/BGCOLOR][/COLOR]

The charm for most groups will be, I think, in the surprises. It would be better if the sealed packets didn't have to be labelled, since it's clear that [i]something[/i] will happen. In theory, the legacy mechanisms promise the development of a sort of grand narrative, but in practice it's unlikely. A good roleplaying group might generate good stories, but even the rulebook encourages mildly embarrassing modifications like naming a continent "Awesometonia"; covering the board with lame in-jokes doesn't have quite the same effect as developing a narrative of a war-torn world.

But even if players take it seriously they're stuck with the game's twists, at least one of which ([COLOR=#000000][BGCOLOR=#000000]the aliens[/BGCOLOR][/COLOR]) is embarrassingly terrible. What you're left with is ultimately just a light wargame with minor factional asymmetry and lots of dice.

More recent developments like TIME Stories present a better way to experience someone else's story (and with mechanisms much better suited to genuine surprises), while other Legacy games are doing more with the format. Which is to say, there are better one-use games and better dudes-on-a-map games, so Risk Legacy is only worth a look if you really need the combination of both.

RATING: 5
My feelings after 6 games. The idea of permanently changing the map, slowly adding new mechanics, etc. is interesting and executed quite well. Unfortunately the big let down for me is the core mechanic - attacking, which is based almost entirely on luck (roll dice, see what happens). Also the game is extremely simple and repetitive - recruit units, move, attack (roll dice) - that is literally all that is happening every single turn of each player. Moreover, the more games a person wins, the more they are able to influence the random factor of fighting (dice) during every future game (although only limited times during each game).

The legacy system is awesome. One of the best innovations in boardgames in my opinion. The game is still reliant on Risk combat rules, which sucks. When you open a new pack, it's the best feeling in the world, but when you've been playing 5 games in a row without anything new, you remember that this game is still Risk and while this is the best Risk ever, that's not saying much.

Just like Risk so far. Waiting to see if more plays and more options open up the decision space.

The rulebook is awful. Impossible to understand the flow of the game from reading, only prior Risk experience made it playable. Nothing is in a logical place, definitions are scattered across the pages, explanations are overwrought making answers impossible to find and what seem like obvious questions are not even covered.

RATING: 6.1
All of the fun seems to be in the deciding on which powers to implement. That was genuinely fun and exciting (it's odd how nerve-wracking tearing up cards can be!), but the game itself really does very little. Risk that plays in 3 or 4 rounds is still Risk with even fewer tactical choices, especially as you are forced to deploy everyone in to one space. With 5 players, this means that if you are player 5, you'll probably be forced to set up either in Asia or Europe, essentially giving you little chance of ever getting any bonus that others can access fairly easily. Changing the board is exciting the first time (and much less so the second), but practically has very little outcome on how games really play. Based on 2 plays with *spoilers* one faction eliminated and initial skills and scar cards in play.

I have never wanted to play Risk so much. Winning and being able to mark the board (and even suriving and getting the chance) is such a cool addition. Also... not knowing how your short term actions may help shape the world later is pretty neat.

Final thoughts: It never felt so good to draw, marr, and destroy components of a game. Played 15 games of this in under 4 months. Totally worth the price.

Un Risk audacieux! Qu'est-ce que je dis: un jeu de société audacieux! Un jeu qu'on doit modifier et détruire au fur et à mesure qu'on joue. Génial! Excitant!

Le jeu lui-meme à l'avantage de se jouer en 60-75 minutes. Mais sa principale qualité est de créer une compétition sur le long terme (15 parties)

This game is a huge hit with my non-gamer friends.  We played risk a lot back in the day and it was easy to get them all on board with this one.  

After one game it is very clear that this is not just a re-themed risk.  There is much more strategy between the special faction powers and the point system.

Cant wait for some of those secret packets to get opened! 

Update after 7 games...

This game is amazing.  We have opened 3 packets so far and none have disappointed.

it is a sacrilege, but a fun one.

I hear another 'legacy' game with actual gameplay is coming out soon. I might have to degrade this one then.

EDIT: Finally finished the campaign, it was fun, and intense in the end. Not gonna start a second run though....

They've taken one of the worst games ever made and turned it into something not quite as bad by having shorter games and self-modifying rules. It'll never be one of my favourites, but it is at least better than basic Risk.

Love the concept. Love the graphic design. Love playing teh game. Love adding new rules and changing the board.

Do not like the length of the game. Games stretch to 2 hours and it is repetitive. I expected the games to keep marching to a conclusion, such as by increasing army trade ins like in the regular game.

There are a small handful of Risk variants worth playing and this is one of them.  The shock value of a permanently modified board is really all that sets this one apart.  You'll need to play it (and scar it) several times to get the value.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Yes, it is still Risk.... Good fun if you like dice. The permanent decisions really keep you thinking about the game. 
Game 3: Even better than the first two games, the changes make the board more interesting. 
Game 9: Seems about time to stop our runaway leader. He won 5 out of 9 games, so he has a lot of advantages on the board and quite a lot of missiles. His last two victories came really quick after two players destroyed each other (the first time it was accidentally due to a packet that was opened), and he made good use of the opportunity. The games both had only two turns!
Game 13: Shifting alliances against the leading player. Everybody wants to make sure that Chris does not win one more game, but of course everybody tries to secure victory for himself. The game balance has shifted a bit more towards Australia and South America as starting positions, but some factions have become very powerful, too. And the player with the best faction will not necessarily be the one with the best placement, so there is still some sort of balance.
Game 15: Chris has named the world, but not won another missile at least. The map has changed a lot recently, and in the last game we opened a package that will change the factions, too. So there is some incentive to keep playing. We want to explore the new possibilities on the map, and we want to see how the factions handle the new properties. Australia and South America are not so great starting positions any more, but probably still good enough. Many factions have natural starting positions now.

I am not interested in a "disposable" game.  However, there seem to be some interesting ideas in it.  If anyone has an intact copy after 15 plays (with all removed components saved aside rather than destroyed) that they want to get rid of, I might consider buying it cheap just to have a look. 

I absolutely agree with the comments of Matthew Kloth and Walter O'Hara above.

This game seems to violate most of my important criteria for what I want out of a boardgame. The mechanics are inelegant, it's imbalanced, it's highly luck-driven, and it only plays with five - ideally, the same five over and over.

But every time we manage to get people together to play it, we all have an enormously good time. I think I've only won one of these ten games, but I've been enjoying myself too much to care.

I'm giving this a 3. One higher than standard Risk. This game is still Risk at it's core. Nothing more. I've played it twice (games 4 & 5), saw the opening of 3 packets and lots of stickers applied. Mutants broke out in the middle of the 2nd game as 2 missiles were used in a turn so we dealt with all that stuff....sounds exciting right? Well at it's core this game is just Risk. Dressed up a bit but it's still fucking Risk. I really don't need to do this again.

I am having a good time with this one so far, each game is a shorter and more interesting game of Risk (and I enjoy Risk).  The legacy element is a great idea and is implemented well here, and I'm excited to see it show up in other games as well as I think this game just scratches the surface of what is possible.  One thing I don't like about the game is that if you get off to a poor start and aren't able to found a city for winning, you have a serious disadvantage in the following games.  It is a very innovative and fascinating game, I just wish the gameplay was a little more fun and the design was a little more appealing.

Very good installment, it hasn't lit any sparks and convinced me to reevaluate risk as a saga, but it has been a nice experience nonetheless, at least the novelty addition of opening the bags has worn off.

The rating is a mix: Risk is a terrible game I don't think anyone involved in the campaign wants to play again ever/any-time-soon, but the Legacy elements were exciting, interesting, and fun. The best parts of the game were opening the packets & seeing how the game would be changing, or after a game was finished & we were naming things, placing cities, et cetera—the worst parts of the game were *playing Risk*. Ugh.

So I'm looking forward to buying Pandemic: Legacy and maybe Seafall, but would generally prefer to avoid playing any more games of Risk. This game is now an artifact on my shelf, not a game to be played.

RATING: 6
Easily the best version of Risk I have played.  A lot of the new systems from Revised are used here, and combined with the "changing" of the game.  The board constantly changes - territories develop ammo shortages, cities come and go, continents can be claimed by victors.  The factions change - Upon losing, they become stronger to help them in the future, upon certain victory conditions they gain special abilities.

The replay value is through the roof and it cuts down the needed play time, so you can squeeze a game in with just a few hours.

The problem with this game is that you need to play with the same group of people every time.

Unfortunately, most people don't share board gaming as their number one hobby (like me), so even though I got people to commit, it fell apart before we got to game 8.

This was a 10, but it's got to drop. It's just too much to rely on the meta-game.

Really looking forward to Seafall, though. Which of course suffers from the same downfall. Hopefully interested parties will stay interested throughout?

Played the game with seasoned Risk gamers and loved it! Legacy made us remember the good times we had with classic Risk (back in the day), but the improvements were also obvious. Now that victory lies in the procurement of four stars, players are at each other's throats from the first turn onwards. You cannot afford to play a solitaire game, because four territory cards can be traded in for a star at the beginning of your turn. And other stars are obtained by conquering enemy HQ's. So you need to be close to the action and keep an eye on the power balance at all times. Add the fast and furious gameplay, the very original "change as you play" concept, and Legacy is a winner in my book! It is amazing how the map turns into a souvenir of all the battles you have fought together. As you can tell, after my next game, my rating may very well increase.

Ok, so, if you love randomness and beginner board games, it's a good variant of Risk.

if you like risk, this is certainly a game for you. Basically it's the same thing, enhanced with individual abilities which you can choose and you can alter the board while playing (name cities, establish cities, enhance or decrease defense values of regions etc.)

Still just Risk at the core.  Kind of a neat gimmick for people who love Risk, but the new gameplay elements you'll see in the first few games are rather weak.  The game does play at a pretty fast pace, but that is because the design very heavily forces the game to end in a pretty awkward manner.

History shows that I am/was involved in two seperate games.  The first game reached game 15 on 08/04/2012, where there was a tie for the naming of the planet.  A second board was purchased on April 1st, 2012 where a second game was created with a second set of gamers, purchased by myself, to where the prize is the game, which will go to the one whom names the planet.  This second game which I am involved in, has only reached the completion of the 8th game, where everyone has at least 1 win.

I played it after Seafall

I was disappointed, I expected more game changing legacy aspects

[+] no turtling, games are short (sometimes too short), good production, secrets unlock at a good pace (about 10-12 games to open the 6 enveloppes), lots of plastic minis (cards quality is a bit cheap), drafting rules are okay; upgrading factions is cool although most abilities are very situational or random (roll a triple never triggered), 

[-] I wish there was more "attachment" for a player to a faction (like in Seafall), but here switching faction every game breaks that, same thing with end-game rewards, if I win a game and change something to help my faction, maybe next game someone else will get my faction so my changes are irrelevant; the combat system is sooo boring, I didn't feel the legacy changes were game breaking (it's basically +1/-1 here and there), there was an error in packaging (content of the 2 big "enveloppes" were switched, which spoiled one of them...); very swingy due to ton of dice rolls; some missions are totally impossible with 5 players, there is a rich get richer effects from most events; I wish there were more stuff to upgrade (like the draft cards, maybe more scar cards), "surprise" factions were nice but I would have prefered more "attachment" to evolving starting factions

Played the first three games of the 15 game campaign so far, and I have to say I am completely shocked by how good this game is. FAR exceeded my expectations. Somehow they figured out the couple minor tweaks the basic game system needed to make Risk an actual solid game, and then all the legacy stuff is just delicious icing on the cake (and really a revolutionary concept). While it is clear that once the campaign is finished the game itself won't ever be played again, those 15 plays are easily memorable enough to justify buying this. Bravo!

Update: as it turns out my interest waned after 7 games (out of 15). In the end it's still Risk and none of the new stuff that kept appearing Fundamentally changed my reawakened boredom with the basic system. No doubt a great concept, but just not enough game in the box to compete with the designer games I enjoy. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is a pretty cool system, I have to admit, but I'm not sure if it's really nothing I've ever seen before.  It just takes the basic idea that comes with more epic wargames -- campaigns -- and uses a different means to manage the upkeep between games.  That the changes become permanent means that one should play toward those goals (and it makes me think that players should know what those changes will be before they start up the next campaign), and I think that's really the heart of the appeal of this game.  Having not played basic Risk, I don't know how Legacy compares with the basic game, but from what I understand from the other players in the game, the first game plays a lot like standard Risk.  I'm interested in playing the game out and participating in the campaigns, but I can't really say that I'm thrilled with the overall gameplay.

Any fan of the original Risk should give this a try. Being able to mold the world over the course of a 15 game campaign  makes the outcome of each battle mean that much more. By the end of the campaign, you'll have a Risk set unlike anyone else's, but the world will be noticeably torn by warfare even after a few games.

There are only two real downsides which are not part of other versions of Risk. The first is that some poor decisions made by players early in the campaign can result in handicaps later on - if everyone is new to Risk: Legacy when you first open the box, you may want to consult with each other on some choices. The second is that to get the most out of those first 15 games, you need to be able to get the same 5 players together each time, which can be difficult.

A thoroughly enjoyable experience throughout - Risk Legacy takes a raw established game that has, let's be honest, become completely stale and revitalizes it in remarkable ways.

A solid game and I really enjoy the "Legacy" mechanics. A one thing to be clear of before you play, not everyone has to be a Risk master but this game is much more enjoyable if everyone has at least a basic understanding of how to play BEFORE y'all start playing. That being said this is a fun new way to play Risk and the lasting effects you leave on the board make you feel more invested in the universe you're in, you WANT to get to that next play session and make sure your rule over the recently titled "Cotton Candy Land" isn't overthrown. There are a few balance issues towards the end that keep this from being an extraordinary title in my eyes, but the game is definitely worth trying if you have the right game group for it.

Initial rating is a 7. way better than any other risk. And quick.. Still a lot of packets to open so might be rated even higher. I still always take my hat off to the streamlined combat mechanic in vanilla risk. It's simplistic, but it' simplistic in the terms of a masterpiece. Just in the sense it is stripped down to that of the basic rolling of x dice.

Innovative concept where you actually mark the board up with stickers and personalized markings during each play.  The winner gets to mark the game board with his name, the date, and even trash talk!  (There are 15 pre-marked lines for this purpose.)  Not only is the game personalized with the markings, but it also includes secret envelopes that are opened at certain stages of the game - in our first game we didn't reach any of these stage, so we don't know what's in the envelopes, but our guess is there are some kind of rule changes.  In the end the game is still Risk, with all the fun of dice combat and area control, but Risk Legacy adds unique strategies that change the game each time the board is marked.  Fun!

A couple of plays in, I'd be lying if I didn't say that my rating may be overblown.  After all, this is just Risk in a funny hat.

The shocker is that this is an outstanding contribution to the field of game design.  Boards are marked, cards are torn and forever lost, and years from now my kids will run their fingers across the signature sticker and marvel at the unrestrained fun that they experienced in their formative years.

I only wish that I were a gangly youth so I could experience [i]Risk Legacy[/i] in its proper glory.  Ah well.

[i]Update:[/i]

Rating increased.  My kids (ages 10 and 14) love this game, as evidenced by the fact that they comment daily on its coolness.  [i]Risk Legacy[/i] is the only non-tournament game that I've played three times in one day, and will go down in history as the best iteration of Risk ever.  Plus, after five games under our belt (all 3-4 players), we still haven't had a game go longer than 75 minutes.

[i]Update #2:[/i]

Just played a friend's copy.  Still awesome.  I can't wait to drag the kids back into the Legacy madhouse.  We're close to the end, I think, but it's been years since we've played...

I only played the opening scenario. It was fairly basic Risk. The main game is Risk so that is ok. With the changes made during and after the game, I can see how this game package is a wonderful idea. The campaign will be written on the board and in the rulebook. Very neat idea.

The legacy aspect makes me look forward to each next round. In addition, the win conditions lean toward quicker games. Regular risk should be played with win conditions rather than total eliminations.

I've had a few chances to play this and I can really see the appeal. I happened to win in 2 turns due to me starting with a star and winning a bonus card worth 2 stars. We played another game right after and the 4 of us were all so equal that the game lasted hours. It was a lot of fun though.

Worse than normal risk.  Players went all in all the time when they saw the chance of winning. That led to very short and unexciting games. Felt like only learning rules and actually not playing the game.

The only broken and breakable game I could possibly enjoy so much and rate so highly.  Legacy was an amazing group choose-your-own-adventure story built on the bones of Risk.  Can't wait for SeaFall!

Wildest and most fun variant on risk I have played yet!! And because Im one of the founders of a board I will always get NUKES!! GOOO FOUNDERS!!!!! Russia got TORE UP!! and I contaminated Alaska just for good measure!! What ever you do DONT open the packet in the bottom of the game box marked, "DO NOT OPEN"...or maybe you will... we voted and opened a pandoras box that changes the game even more!!

Off to a good start. Our first game took significantly longer than I expected but I would think it would go down a bit as more powers are introduced. It's still Risk but the ongoing campaign and permanent changes to the board add a lot. The next two games took much less time, we played two in about 2-2.5 hours but also had to deal with several packets. The game really changes as things are revealed and you will constantly have to re-evaluate what your strategy was, since strengths and weaknesses will come up in factions and on the board. 

It's still Risk though. Zerging and turtling can still be effective. We've also had some events and sealed packets lead to ridiculous run away victories and huge power swings.

Games are taking much less time as we get further into the campaign; 45-60mins per game.

We completed the 15 to end the regular campaign of this. It was enjoyable but I really think you need 5 to get maximum potential from this game. Events/missions never really cycled and we only got to place the World Capital through manipulation during the last game. It was okay with 3, a little too swingy with similar starting/choke points. It would really shine with 5.

Played first 2 games, very cathartic being able to destroy cards and write on the game board.
Played 3 more games. The experience is getting wilder now that we have opened our first 3 envelopes and one pocket. The pocket for using 3 missiles was very surprising.

This is much better than original risk because of the Victory point aspect.  No longer will we have to plan on taking out every single troop.  However, I fortified my HQ and had a bunker on it, yet I still lost in a defense with 9 troops against 5.  Once again, dice is against me.  I decided to order a dice tower and test it out to see if my feelings towards the game changes.  I do like the fact that even though you don't win the game, you can still affect the game at the end, unless you were totally eliminated.

Brilliant and innovative idea.

So far, for my money, it does not run far enough with the potential.

UPDATE: the game is certainly improving over time, but at too slow a pace for our group's taste, I fear. However, I do like what it is doing.

If you had told me that I'd play five games of Risk over the course of two days, I would have laughed.  If you had told me that I'd have the most fun playing those games than I have had playing games in a long time, I would have thought you crazy.  Five years from now I'll still remember how Egypt got the way it did on our earth.

Kudos to Rob and Hasbro!

The first Legacy game, however the base game is still just Risk, which drags the game down a lot.

RATING: 7.8
Fixes some of the major flaws of vanilla risk (long games, imbalanced map, drawn out combats). Writing on a board (you can name continents and cities after winning) and opening new packs (adding rules, new units, stickers on the board) as you play more games is a ton of fun. The downside is that you mostly have to play with the same group every time.

No game has ever left me wanting to play it again after each time I finish a game like this game.  This found a way to leave you with cliff hangers at the end of every game.  Also the changing rules lets you see who you play with is good at adapting their strategies each week or need to plan far in advance for what might happen.  I really hope a lot more games like this come out.

Looking back at this game after a couple years of completing it still stands as by far my favorite game.  Most memorable moments I have had in a game.  We still talk about games we played from years ago.

Awesome. Only three games so far and we seem to play a lot of rules wrong constantly even though this is such a simple game (probably due to the booze). No one minds though and everyone is anxiously awaiting the opening of more packs. Wish more games were innovative like this.

Wow, just wow. I grew tired of the Risk games after they became too samey to me. I heard lots of good comments about this one, so we organized a group to play it through. I was amazed at how the changes in this version made Risk feel fresh all over again. A game where your decisions actually matter for future games is really cool, and looking at the suffering of people when they have to tear up a card is amazing.

Probably the last Risk I played and certainly the most fun I had with the game. Over the course of a year, my wife, two friends, a rotating 5th player and myself destroyed the earth for bragging rights. It's still just Risk but the Legacy aspects more than make up for it.

It's specialty risk with the twist that after a number of plays you cant really play the game ever again. which is OK i guess, especially if you remember that this is risk and you can pretty much know who is going to win after set up.
All in all an OK Legacy game especially since risk is so old and stale that it needs the rules changes in order to spice things up.
Also I opened the "do not open ever." package after I found it during the 5th game and ruined every thing for everyone every game after.

The build up and narrative of changes to the powers and board are a pretty neat experience. It's still Risk, with its faults (bash the leader, wackamole continent sniping, rewards early turtling, the basic combat mechanic), but adds an interesting meta-arc to it.

The biggest shame is the initial setup procedure, where you start from one space and spread out. That tends to exacerbate some of Risks faults, especially early turtling, and so it can take a few rounds for the action to get going.

One of the coolest concepts for a game ever!  I love the hidden rules changes and the development of the game. At it's core-- it's Risk.  I can't wait for the legacy concept to hit more interesting core systems.

Original Risk I would give a 4 or 5, by comparison. Personal customization and the 'to the victor go the spoils' mentality really turn this game from average to solid. Well worth the fifteen plays required to customize your board.

Follow up to Ogre. More scenarios, more like a conventional wargame than the original.

RATING: 6
It is an updated version of [thing=5206][/thing] with updated combat rules and better scenarios.  Playing with a stack of GEVs vs. an army is even better than one giant tank.  One of the better pocket games on the market.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Solid, deserving follow-up to the original OGRE. Expanded the number and type of units in play and offered a new map, but didn't really offer much in the way of new tactics or considerations. No new development in the background of the Pan European and Combine armies at war, why they were fighting over, or where. Ultimately, it came across as more of the same. And for the price, it's still worth it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Along with Squad Leader the game that set me on the path of hex+counter wargaming (I have always played miniatures wargames). This is a super-elegant game with lots of play in the base box. Cool scfi touches as well as a basic tactical wargame with simple rules but lots of ways to tackle tactical challenges. Flexible force pools added to this. Never so keen on Ogre and I had sold my original set but I repurchased the recent $3 re-issue and have played a few times for great fun. Much prefer the geomorphic maps of GEV though. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
My first Steve Jackson game-I bought Ogre soon after. The quintessential Metagame!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Perfect for what it is. A $3.95 (originally) game that gives you tank and infantry warfare, a map with multiple types of terrain, several scenarios out of the box, and an OK amount of replay value. Also includes some Ogres and train counters. 

G.E.V. is an OK game for a beginner. Very balanced. While learning, the game has an Ok level of replay-ability. It's easy to think up your own scenarios. There is a point system for choosing pieces. (Points also make it easy to handicap for new players.) Each side has the same type of units, same strengths. 

Unfortunately, there are price gougers who try to sell the pocket edition for $50, or more. Not worth that imo; save your money. This game lends itself to Print-N-Play anyway since the original map is small ~11"/14", counters are tiny, and the counter artwork is very basic.

Easy to learn, hard to master.  The rules are nearly flawless and run smoothly.  The game's outcome usually depends on player decisions rather than luck, but players must also be able to adapt to unexpected events.  In short, I believe that GEV is the finest tactical wargame ever created.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An excellent classic.  Biphase carbide armored, nuclear weapon tossing death machines cruise the wasteland of the future, seeking mastery over the opposing player.  You owe it to yourself to try this out so you at least learn to appreciate hex and counter war games.

Though compatible with Ogre, this is a stand alone game.  Personally I prefer it to Ogre.  It greatly expands the game system without going to far.  It's not meant to be a detailed simulation, and it doesn't try to be.  Instead, it simply tries to be a fun, fast playing, game about futuristic tactical armored combat, and it succeeds.

While I consider OGRE and GEV more or less the same game...they are not.  GEV takes units, movement, and options a step further than the original OGRE.  It is still part of a coherent game series that rocks the house of elegance, ease, balance, fun, and credible tactical play.

I played the crap out of this game in my teen years, and as soon as I can find some interested parties will be playing it again.  I find the level of play to be perfect.  There is enough complexity to be very interesting, but not so much that you get bored hunting down rules.  With GEV + OGRE + Shockwave + the Reinforcement pack + some of the variants available on the web it never gets stale.

picked up the deluxe set (Ogre and GEV) for $4.95 apparently never opened (still in a very dusty wrapper) and it's unpunched/uncut (I'm trying to verify counter count w/Steve Jackson Games as the box says one thing and the internal sheet doesn't come close to that number) at a used store. 

Awesome!!!

I've been wanting this since I was a teen. Will it hold up to my memories of playing my buddy back when I was...what 11? 

Who knows, but a light battle game, easily portable...will get played.

Sentient robot tanks battling against a huge array of forces is just my cup of tea but not here for some reason!

I remember playing this when I was younger. It was good, in the 6-8 range. It's absolutely amazing that a little game like this can offer so much excitement and replayability.
You need to get the expansions and supplements to really get the most out of the game system. And once you do have all that stuff, you've got virtually endless replayability at your fingertips. Even though it'll cost you upwards of $50 to get all that stuff (Ogre, G.E.V., Shockwave, Reinforcements, etc.), it's still a better value than a lot of very expensive games that will only get played a couple of times (if at all.)

RATING: 8
Classic, quick playing, low complexity wargame.  Fast moving with usually lots of carnage.  May not have the "personality" of Ogre, but as a game, offers a wider range of scenarios and tactical options.

One of my first wargames, and one I have fond memories of even if I have not played the game in awhile.  Remember playing the scenario "Raid" several times solo... excellent fun in a compact package.

This game and Ogre truly deserve a reissue with upgraded components.

Another one I inherited from my brother.  I still haven't played it yet.  I don't have a copy of OGRE to go with it.  I know that is not essential, but I still keep an eye open for one.

RATING: 7
A classic, and still a great value.

Unfortunately, the first die rolls in any given game are much more important than the last die rolls.  Really that's more a feature of "warfare" than GEV in particular, though.

RATING: 9
Much more of an expansion of Ogre than for example Wizard is to Melee - while retaining the same qualities of the original system (relatively few rules, clarity, quite some freedom to plan, aggressive play), at the cost of a couple of pages more of rules G.E.V. adds stacking and terrain effects, multiplies the possibilities of attacking via the spillover fire mechanism (= side effects on units in the same stack) and offers varied scenarios (one of them including a train!). It almost feels that G.E.V. pushes this format of terrestrial combat to its limits.

A wonderful introduction to wargaming.  Short rules.  I like it more than Ogre; it has more tactical variety.  A nice thing is that the units really require different strategies and tactics depending on the terrain.  Try 'Raid', for example, with heavy tanks rather than GEV's.  It is a totally different scenario.

A friend who never had played a war game before expressed interest in them.  I started him with Ogre / GEV and he loves the games.  He is very eager to play more war games.
My philosophy is to start with something fun and let them learn the basics.  Then you can move on to more realistic and complex games if you want to.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Probably the high point of microgames. Small, fast and has a reasonable punch, just like the titular units.

This takes the 'conventional' forces from Ogre and puts them in the much more complex setting of normal terrain, instead of the blasted wasteland of the original. Little things like overruns, stacking, defense bonuses, the sensitivity of GEVs to terrain all combine to make this *slightly* more complex than the original, but a lot deeper to play.

I own all versions of OGRE/GEV except the last one (as I do not like the 2.5D Ogres) and now own loads of metal miniatures. GEV works very well as long as there are no OGRES and there are some streams on the map. The odd rule about stopping when crossing a stream makes them very important and thus you get some tactics involved.

The Ogre/GEV edition.  Teamed with Ogre this is the coolest LITTLE wargame ever made.  GEV can be played without Ogre, small unit style.  It includes better and bigger maps (geomorphic), better scenarios, and more units.  An absolute must have for Ogre to go from a good  microgame to a "real" wargame in a small package.  Now, include Ogre and the other Ogre add-ons, Shockwave, Battlefields, and the Reinforcements Pack, you end up with a GREAT low level wargame, and ALL of it fits in ONE really small box (VHS tape case).  Well balanced, portable, many different board configurations, different scenario types, infinite replability, simple rules, and fun every time I play. A true classic.

Love this game.  Got it before Ogre, so was kind of let down by Ogre, but combined they make a very nice game.  Just wish there was version between the pocket box and the miniatures version.  Sort of like a boockcase game with larger, thicker counters and sturdier more stable map boards.  Especially liked the build-your-own scenario point system.

This game (with or without expansions)is a great strategic game, that can play in a quick time with the right scenario - or you can choose a longer scenario...started with Ogre, and enjoyed GEV next! LaserTower measuring can be a little irritating, though. There should also be more pre-tested scenarios that use all the new maps of the expansions...

Hard to categorise.  Good mechanics - interesting and new to me.  But the game ended with an avalanche of points (for me),  allowing me to win with about $4M, for reasons that were never quite clear to me.  I think I kept claiming bonuses, and because of this I was able to recover the cards I played, so I could get the bonus again, ......  Would play again.

RATING: 5
A no-luck game (apart from setup), Monad borders on the abstract. However (at least with 4) the game has an odd zugzwang quality (you can be compelled to make a move that seriously weakens your position). However, in my mind there are two main flaws:

1) it's an analysis game where you really can't analyze before your turn often, because the position changes radically. So it's slow.

2) Many decisions (the order to return cards in) have impacts that are hard to predict. Butterfly effect.

Rating -- Indifferent (which, for me, for an abstract, is pretty good).

For a card game with a pretty basic concept and rules there is a ton that is going on while playing.  I found the cardplay pretty deep and while it was our first game, you start to discover tricky ways to manipulate the piles so you can get max tradeability.  I'm looking foward to playing this again.  

I think this is a six.  It just doesn't click well with me BUT I still like to play this now and again.

Monad… This isn’t my first Sid Sackson, but it’s the first one that I’m not really sure how I feel about it. We spent the majority of the game in a sort of baffled state; trading, buying and leaping our way somewhere. Never really sure exactly what we were doing or where we were headed. I don’t know if there was a layer of strategy we were missing or if all we found was all there really is in the game. I’d like to try this again, but it was such a miss with the group that I don’t think it will ever come out again.

A bunch of cards with numbers and colors on them with a bunch of rules thrown on top to TRY to turn it into a game without rhyme nor reason.  If the object was just to play until you obtained ONE of the target 80 point cards, the game would be ‘okay’ at best, but then you are basically forced to start all over again and do it three more times.  After I got one target card, I really started to get bored (and I was actually the first one to get the 80-point card).  I completely lost interest in the game and zoned-out.  I feel that the fact there is no hand limit to the number of cards a player can hoard, makes the game broken, too.  The game is very prone to Analysis Paralysis galore.   Basically the game is just boring and way too long for what it is.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The step climbing here is unique and almost relaxing, and there are definitely feelings of a payoff when you complete a big combo turn.  However, the repetitiveness can easily make the game overstay its welcome and feel drawn out. It's also curious to me why the deck is not shuffled or why you have to lose a whole turn to flip the deck.

Unusual mechanics inject a bit of interest into a game that has little player interaction (though there are exceptions).  Compact and visually appealing.  A bit counter-intuitive that cards with "3" printed on them are called "bi's," cards with "7" printed on them are called "tri's," etc.  Worthwhile just for its weirdness. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Another clever Sackson game - card game for 2-4 players where the goal is to trade up your cards from a common market to try to acquire the elusive and valued monads.  The main mechanic is somewhat reminiscent of Sackson's Bazaar, except that in Monad players can make multiple trades on a turn, setting up a chain that can bring big rewards.  Very unusual and unique, yet it works.

Monad is another classic Sid Sackson title that deserves to be more widely known. Like many of his other designs, it encourages deep gameplay within the context of a relatively straightforward ruleset. It's a rather abstract design that thrives on clever and deep decisions, as players try to set themselves up to acquire higher level cards by making well-planned chains and combinations. While it might not match the heights of Sackson giants like Acquire, Monad still recommends itself on account of its unique mechanics and unusual design, and is convincing evidence that Sid Sackson was an original thinker. Kudos to Gryphon Games for helping bring the genius of Sid Sackson into the hands of gamers worldwide in a quality reprint worthy of his brillance.

Sackson hits it again with another very enjoyable and interesting card game. I love how Sackson gets a math-y idea and is able to translate it so purely into a card game. There is a simple climbing mechanic with several options present to climb. One's turn is sometimes obvious, but there is always room for thought to see if one can maximize their turns and way they play their cards. As well with the extra bonuses, wildcards and the manner in which cards must be played, players must sometimes hold out for a card that better serves them or take the rest and hope their trade pays off. I think the idea is definitely an 8 in my books, with the game only losing a rank because of its wash-and-repeat style - something that I rarely like in a game. Regardless, Monad is further proof that Sackson is one of the more interesting designers I am aware of.

Believe me, readers: this is an underrated game!

3M gamette. The game that brought me to the Geek. Thanks, Monad! Have yet to play an entire game, though...

Update: Went back to the coast with this 5 months after first trying it and discovering BGG in the process. And we still played it wrong. Commons are NOT wild! Oh well, we're going back in June. For now, a tentative rating of 6, cause I see it has real promise.

Update: Finally went back to the coast and finally played correctly. People call Venture a brainburner? Monad casts Venture into a lake of fire. Excruciating, this game. But I like the burn. Want to play this one well enough that I can look at a hand of cards and have the next dozen transactions be obvious.

Update: Gosh, this is good with three. Temperature lock-up, by drawing commons of just one temperature, is less an occurrence. 

Monad is a very fine game that doesn't feel dated in the least. The little rush experienced when recognizing a clever combination of transactions that result in an elusive Monad is one of the essences of gaming.

Monad is a mathematical trading game from Sid Sackson, based on a 6-color/suited deck of cards which is strictly used for trading purposes after the initial deal.

In many ways this reminds me of Sackson's Bazaar- a game where players manipulate their goods through to increase their overall value.

Players either trade cards from their hand for higher valued cards, draw common (value 1) cards if available, or turn over the deck of discarded commons so they are available for drawing.

Cards are traded in color-pairs (warm+cool) for higher value cards; commons go to the discard, mid-value cards go to the bottom of the common stacks to become available as they rise to the top.

The calculation of how to best optimize the cards in one's hand, given what is available is what makes the play of this interesting.  Sometimes it is possible to setup a series of trades to acquire a Monad and even possibly setup the next acquisition after this, other times players simply draw to build commons in hand for future trades, or struggle to the bottom of the pile looking for plays.

I like this implementation (I am also fond of Bazaar), and I found it simpler and more to the point than Bazaar, where specialized sets of gems are randomly available.  Monad streamlines this to common sets of cards, but each player has their own wild card color, so there can be some gamesmanship trying to acquire one's own cards (or bury an opponent's).

Aftrer a 1st 2-player play I am starting this at a 6.75, slightly lower than I currently rate Bazaar, but actually more likely to get to the table, and increase in my rating.

This is a nice little logic-based Sackson game, and I am really pleased that Gryphon made it readily available again in a nice new edition.

As new players, we all forgot various opportunities at different times, and I have no idea how the winner came from behind to take a victory.

I wanted to like this one, it has a lot of ideas that are pretty neat going for it.  But I was unhappy with the manipulation of the hot/cold combos that came up and think it would be a better happier game if you could do something like only make 1 trade on your turn or something to that effect.  The board (such as it was) changed drastically between plays, and we only had three.  I'm sure it'd get crazier with 4.  I'll try again, but my rating will probably go down.

Card values get traded in pairs for higher value cards, with the goal of accumulating four top value chits. Cards can also be bought and there are ways to jump ahead via wild cards and multi-common turn ins. But the catch is that the pairs have to combine warm and cool colours -- with only one complimentary colour pair matches art theory. The mechanics take a little getting used to.

PLUS: clean art work, strategy is there but not too heavy
MINUS: the mechanics are a bit confusing, wrong art theory
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Set-collecting, climbing game where you try to chain together trades and buys to get the highest valued card, the elusive Monad. The play is pretty repetitious and maybe the game is a little long for what it is. It feels like a game to pass the time, and not intended to fully engage. It is sort of like a group solitaire with everyone playing against the table and not really against each other. If you like puzzling out the optimum chain of moves in a game, then you might like this.

Playing to five Monads takes a while. Perhaps too long. The game is odd, and kind of clunky. Also, it doesn't really change: once you get the first Monad, you're pretty much back to where you started from, except with one Monad. Now repeat four times (when playing with two).

I probably want to try this with three; with two, this is not going to cut it, as while Monad is cool, there are other games that are much better.

Indifferent.

RATING: 9
Excellent abstract card game. Really like the various uses of color in the game (warm/cool combinations, bonus combos, personal wild colors, etc). Starting to notice that it's a bit too easy to trade your way to a monad with a quint and a wild bi when playing with just two; seems cheap when it happens too often (might try Arnott's no wild colors idea–see below). Probably best with 3-4 players. Less of a brainburner than [i]Bazaar[/i] (6), and therefore more fun. [7 plays, with many more before the dawn of the BGG]

Easily Sid Sackson's oddest creation, bearing only some resemblance to Bazaar - while in both games the players move towards the goal via trading, Bazaar's single exchanges find a counterpoint in the unrestricted length of a player's turn here: long, laborious chains of cards being traded for other cards of higher levels are the result. Which means room for the players to move in...

The gameplay here is fantastic - there's lots of nuances to discover play after play: having the cards face-up in all different levels enables to focus on different cards or trades (short-, mid- or long-term), trading with the right timing saves the players losing a turn flipping the discard deck, and stalling levels or discarding in the right order are obvious tools. I haven't seen the rich get richer problem at all, but rather "sawtooth" dynamics - the only way I can imagine this problem appearing is with much time and docile rivals.

Monad is in several ways surprising: the use of colours, the uneven differences between card values, the multiple twists the game takes just recycling the same cards again and again, the importance of every little move... while it's quite a brain burner, and it might not be for every player, there are not many games as bold and original as this one.

Game where the rich get richer.  As soon as you start accumulating bonus draws, you take off.  If you don't, you patiently wait all game long.  Edit: 2 more plays.  Getting better.

Remember the Tower of Hanoi puzzle? You have three spikes. There is a pyramid of disks stacked on one of the spikes. The disks are staked on top of another in ascending size so that the smallest is on top and the largest is on the bottom. The object of this puzzle is to move the pyramid of disks from one spike to another. You can only move one disk at a time, and cannot place a larger disk on a smaller one.

Solving this puzzle is extremely repetitive. This game feels exactly the same. To reach one objective, you have to *repeat* all the steps you did to achieve the previous objective. I think there are about 6 levels to achieve the "final" objective. So to achieve that final objective, you have to repeat the first objective six times.

The game is all about setting yourself up such that you can take shortcuts to reach that final objective.

Picked it up again after a long time, while rediscovering a couple of Sid Sackson games, owned for many years but seldom played. Though the learning curve here is steeper compared to other games by Sid, also due to the mistakes in the terrible german rules book, this surely is one of Sid's best card games.

Kooky economic game, where you trade up your sets to more valuable sets.  Despite the fact that this came out in 1969 it still feels individual.  It's a really cool concept for a game, where the mechanics surprisingly work.  I do worry that it has a runaway leader problem, but I do know that the downtime could be a real bitch.  I wouldn't be interested in playing this with more than three.

Great abstract card game that reminds me a little of the ios game "Threes".  "Leaping" and using wild cards seems to be the correct strategy after only two plays.  Looking forward to exploring different strategies.

Hopefully we were doing something wrong, but I don&#039;t think so...last game of the evening went on and on endlessly and I was late getting home.  I got in trouble with the Mrs. from playing Monad of all games!  Takes way too long for this type of game and isn&#039;t all that exciting during this long exercise.

I don't get why this is listed as abstract strategy. It is a card game and a trading game. I remember it being better. Butterbox.

Interesting building/trading game. Except you don't trade with each other, you trade with the system. Unfortunately, it suffers in comparison to modern cardgames, I'm afraid.

Really cool game. Was a bit overwhelming at first, with all the different moves you can do, and the specific rules and prerequisites for some of them, but I believe we got it, and it seemed a lot of fun to play! Look forward to playing again.

Monad is entirely abstract. Jokingly, another player asked for a thematic rules explanation at which point I discovered that there actually isn't even an attempt at one.

It's a little mathy, but the three different ways of moving up through the card decks are interesting and offer lots of variety and choices. One player held all of the wild commons for other players which made it drag a lot and rather spoilt the game (though won it for him no end). Alas, I think that's probably the optimal thing to do and will probably result in all of the wilds being withheld in all future games. Which is a shame because I really enjoyed my first play of Monad.

03 DEC 2010: My Dad found an IN SHRINK copy of this game earlier this year and got it for me! WOW! Interestingly, I also made and ordered and Artscow version just 24 hours before! My version is slightly tweaked, but WOW! Now I have both! Unfortunately, I've only been able to play it once since then. We played 2-player. It was good (and we got an important rule wrong) but I think ultimately 3-player is the sweet spot.

----------------------

I really love the interesting mechanics of this game. Very deep game with almost a puzzle aspect, but definitely also a lot of opponent screwage. Really really fun.

I want a copy of this (or maybe I'll do an Artscow, but mostly want an original)

I have only played two-player. Be prepared for the first one or two games to seem rather opaque until you learn how to effectively set up longer strings of plays. The game is interesting in that you really have to plan ahead to set up combinations so as to trade cards for the most value while collecting large bonuses and wild cards (i.e., cards of your color). Once you get the hang of it, the game opens up. It actually feels like a "pure" version of some of the modern combo-building card games. In that sense, I enjoy the game (unlike some modern and heavily themed equivalents). The problem is downtime for the non-active player. Most turns are actually rather quick. But when someone is putting together two or three turns in a row of massive combinations, it can drag for the non-active player, and feel like a solitaire exercise for the active player. Nonetheless, as a "once in a while game" for two, it's a keeper.

Start with low value cards, then trade them up the ladder to higher values.  Cards have a face value but can be levaraged higher when played in specific color combinations. Your trade-ins become available for following players to pick up.

I am slow and weak at envisioning the leverage opportunities.

Old Sackson brain burner card game. Another custom version, I made one with different colour combinations making it easier to see matched pairs. 

Can be unforgiving, last game I made one mistake and my wife just trounced me, running off combo after combo on her turn, while my turn consisted of "draw 1 card".

Abstract card game of color and number sets that are traded for 80 point ying yangs. Game is largely trading cool or warm colors.  In addition, the color sets have sets of symbols. Interesting dynamic that the draw pile is never shuffled.

A very interesting game, entirely composed of making strange trades with the board to try to reach a goal "worth".  There are just a few differences between this, and its earlier incarnation, [thing=1520][/thing]:

[thing=2184]The First Million[/thing] claims to be for 2-4, rather than 3-4.  It is significantly less interesting with 2 players, and has no rules to make it more interesting for 2.

[thing=1520][/thing]'s circular symbols provide more of a visual distinction between the commons (10k) and the higher-value things, which I think is helpful.

[thing=1520][/thing]'s goals are the 80's, while The First Million's are 1 MIO (1M) money bags.  The 80 makes sense, where the million does not, because in both cases, you can "buy" the 80 for a total of 80 in smaller cards, and the "million" for a total of 800,000 in smaller stocks.

[thing=2184]The First Million[/thing]'s colors are matched complementarily and intuitively (though the print run could have better distinguished them), which is an improvement over [thing=1520][/thing]'s weird pairings of colors.

In both, however, the goal items are quite different from the cards used to play the game.

There is just something kind of fascinatingly mechanical, yet opportunistic about this game.

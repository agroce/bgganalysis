RATING: 10
One of the best games ever. Easy rules, planety tactics, visual appeal and great tension. 

Works well with three or more (I disagree that it needs 5 as some say).

The box is too big though and the expansions don't add anything (they make the game worse).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Excellent. Broad horizon of options built on a simple, really elegant system. Deeply interactive, victory must be pursued round by round, optimizing your long period resources (caballeros for area control and power cards for turn order selection) with the tactical dilemmas offered by the shared action cards. Due to the random extraction of the action cards, every round can bring unexpected twists to the game, but nothing can beat a good tactical (and strategic, to some extent) play. Furthermore, I was surprised by its accessibility: I've had the opportunity to play El Grande with some non-gamers and they really appreciated the game, since their first play. 
Shake and serve to 3 people or more (with 2 the game can be dry, not nearly as good as in 4 or 5).

Hans im Glück (German) version. Neat and solid euro components. Minor complaints: the score track on the board is without numbers (only in the HiG version, as far as I know), the iconography on the cards is a bit less intuitive than I expected: it will usually take more than one game to completely forget about the text, be it right on the cards or on a handy translation. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The beauty of this game is that the rules and mechanics are fairly simple.  Its the cards that make your brain burn nearly every turn - this means that those who want to think deeply can (and will probably blow the opposition away) and those who want light can just pick a card on a fairly ill-considered basis and still know what is going on in the game.  Some of the cards are great in that they cause the complexion of the board to change completely.

Upped rating from 8 to 9.

RATING: 7.5
I'm not a big fan of area majority games but this is the best of them. Far too tactical and not enough strategy for me to rate it any higher but I still enjoy it
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The "Granddaddy of Euro cube pushers." I adore area control/influence games, and I find that the subtle strategy in the game is a nice touch. Not hard to learn (I teach it in about 5 minutes), but the strategy takes a couple games to completely unfold. Another plus to me; you play against other players. I understand the criticism that the cards make it random to some degree, but there are ways to mitigate that through use of expansions.

Lots of folks (read; most in my experience) play this at 4 and 5p. I get that, the turn order allocation and board are interesting with lots of people. You can manipulate folks into doing your dirty work, etc. 2p though shouldn't be sneezed at (not my fav player count, but very playable). The differences are that 2p requires much more fanatical attention to the board than turn order. Where as in 4 or 5p, you can't be everywhere, let alone defend everywhere, at 2p, you basically have a shot at just about anywhere and I've found I can win various districts with just 1 dude. K&I cards help 2p.

RATING: 7
One of a very few eurogames which can be described as "fun".
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The definitive area control game.

It's all about getting majorities in Spanish provinces, or at least scoring some second-place points where you can.  Some great original ideas here, including the use of power cards to determine play order, face up action cards to execute your actions (OK so that's not too original), and the secret disc/Castillo used to plan for sneak attacks.

There's a tradeoff with every decision- play too high a power card, and you don't get to import many caballeros (cubes), plus you're likely to have to play your power card last next round, select a powerful action card, and you don't get to place many caballeros, put too many caballeros into the Castillo, and it's overkill.

Plays 2-5, but I find it to be better with 4-5.  Long-range strategy can be difficult, as this game is very tactical, but it is definitely a strategic game.  One of the best Euro games ever, and a must for any gamer.

Own the El Grande expansions.

A game from the golden age of Euros.  El Grande is a multi-player conflict game where you can't kill your opponents' dudes.  At best you can outnumber them at the right time.  Yet they persists, those voiceless masses, not so patiently waiting for their day in the sun.

The Castillo is a lot of fun, trying to remember what's in there while competing for position on the board.

An almost perfect game with great pacing.

Got a single play in over the weekend.  The rules are quite simple yet the game provides a lot of strategic depth.  I have a strong feeling that this will turn into an 8 with additional plays.

After additional plays, this one can be very tense.  A "gang up on the leader" mentality often develops, which can be a lot of fun.

I haven't had the desire to play this one in a while, which tells me that it should have a lower rating (down from 7.5).

It's a 9 with 5 and a 7 with 3. One of the surprising things about this game is how simple it is to learn - pretty much gateway-game level. The depth, however, is so much more. It's a great, tense game... but also a bit of a min-maxing game which isn't my favourite style.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Smooth-playing, tense, and exciting, with just the right amount of randomness as well as several clever game mechanics. This isn't a game where you build a strong position from the start; you have to be willing to drop your previous plans and think up a new one at a moment's notice. Not to say that there isn't some level of strategic planning, but you have to be willing to squeeze the most out of every turn to really get the most out of this game. There's a lot to like here; El Grande is a deserved classic of boardgaming, though I imagine it's probably a bit dry for some people.

This game will require more plays to truly appreciate, but I do just *love* the mechanisms in play. I needed a really great area control game and this one does indeed seem like the one. It's vicious, but that doesn't rattle me - sometimes, it's just the thing. Even though I have all the expansions bundled in this one box, I've never played with anything but the base game. Feels like enough for me. Classic.

2007/XX/XX: I'm not a big fan of this game but will play if someone lays it on the table.

Edit 2010/5/13: Played again after many years and I had to raise the rating from 6 -> 8. Maybe I wasn't ready for El Grande when I first tried it a few years ago. This must mean that I've grown as a boardgamer. Especially I've grown into area control games.

2013/01
8->9
Just great. El Grande has developed into a solid favourite of mine and I'm always in a mood for playing it. This clearly satisfies the criteria for a 9

2016/04
9->10
It is really astonishing how a game I initially perceived as dry has revealed so much depth and flavour over the years. Every single decision feels infinitely important and there are no dead moments in the game. Upon almost every move you have to choose whether you want to capitalise the potential immediately or build up your position for later rounds, and all actions have an impact on your opponents. Thus, the playing time of approx. 90 minutes with 4-5 players is packed full of excitement.

However, it is easy to see why El Grande is not to everyone's tastes. The game is very confrontational with a lot of in-your-face moments. It is also rather chaotic since you have very little control over other players. Thus it is crucial to tolerate a constant feel of insecurity and uncertainty. But this is not to say that the game is random. Actually it is far from it.

I must admit that at today's standards the game does not look very appealing and mechanically it is very simple. But even with this simple set of rules you find yourself agonising over your decisions. Not because the decision tree would be too big but for the trade-offs you have to take.

If there is something to really criticise about El Grande it would be the fact that the game plays well only with 4-5 players the optimum being 5. With fewer players you usually end up in a situation where the game is decided at the very moment when two players start fighting. In this case the third player usually claims the prize. Moreover, in really tight games you can have king making situations. Personally I have come to tolerate this and don't feel sorry for losing if it was due to a kingmaker because I know I played well.

In a nutshell, El Grande should be used as an example of a reasonably fast playing game in which every move is significant.

I think this is going to be one of my favourites as I play it more and more.  I was very impressed with its depth and elegance.  There are lots of things to think about and the mechanics are well integrated.  

It reminded me of San Marco in many respects - the area control and mess-up-you-neighbour mechanisms are similar and some of the cards do the same sorts of things.
Having said that, San Marco is a much quicker game with less, though still significant depth, but possibly slightly more elegance (it's simpler and works with less big shifts).

Which is preferable may come down to the number of players available at the time.

For an area control game it is quite interesting but ultimately it is usually won by the player in second place as the current leader gets targeted towards the end.

Area influence game in medieval Spain. Get your nobles into the various regions and score points on a descending scale based on what your total nobles compared to your rivals is. Cards determine order of play and what actions you can take. A game where experience of the action cards would appear to be a necessity. Enjoyable and I suspect a game I will need to play a lot more to actually be able to compete.

El Grande is a great area control game that's easy to learn, but takes a few games to figure out the relationship between the auction, the action cards, and the overall gaming strategy. 

I love the auction system, which uses numbered bid cards (1-13) that also determine how many cabelleros you can move into court (the lower the bid, the higher the number of pieces). Since you have to move the cabelleros from the provinces to the court before you use them on the game board, you need to make sure that you have an adequate supply. 

At the same time, you also have figure out how you want to bid for the action cards. You have a choice among 5 action cards, 4 of which are replaced with new cards each round. And each action card determines how many cabelleros you can move onto the board.

So, there are multiple factors that you need to think about for each auction - (1) the action card and the number of pieces you can move onto the board, (2) the bid cards that also determines how many pieces you can move into your supply, and (3) what your overall goal is for the round and how it could affect other rounds.

You also need to consider the scoring, which happens after the 3, 6, and 9 rounds. I like this because it gives everyone a heads-up on who's in the lead and allows you to re-evaluate your own strategy.

Juegazo de mayorías con mayúsculas. Crea gran tensión, muchas posibildiades tácticas y lo mejor, las vueltas que da la partida, nadie sabe a ciencia cierta quien va ganando. De esos juegos en los que en la primera partida ya estás disfrutando. Ningún jugador se queda descolgado, bastante interacción o incluso puteo. Jugado a 5 jugadores impecable, aunque con menos de 4 no tiene gracia. Uno de los juegos que más ganas tenía de probar y que ha cumplido con creces mis expectativas. A medida que ha pasado el tiempo, sigue estando de entre msi favoritos, y sigue viendo mesa con relativa facilidad.

RATING: 9
El Grande was my introduction into gaming. I've played far more games of this than my play count suggests because I've only recently started logging my plays. Currently it is my highest rated game, not only because of the nostalgic place in my heart it holds, but also because of the intensely interactive and strategic game play it offers.

Each game feels fresh, new, and tense. I feel invested in the outcome of this game and that's always a good sign. Every time I play it I remember why I love it so much. Truly a great game.

RATING: 9
A lightly (but nicely) themed game, with a relatively simple rules system. A mild element of luck in an otherwise highly strategic game. It seems to me that there is very great replayability in El Grande, and that it would take a very long time (if ever) to master it.

Pros
- Simultaneous action selection + area control
- A Euro where you can mess with people. Direct interaction
- Take that!
- Cool cube cards that can change the dynamic of the game

Cons
- Very very dry. 
- The board is kind of bland
- The box is is kind of bland
- It can use a re-theme and it'd be awesome
- Plays best with 4-5 only. 

Sold/Traded because:
- It plays best and maxes out at 5 people. Hard to get exactly that many people. 
- Dry theme doesn't make anyone excited to play it despite fun mechanics

El Grande is a classic one that the only complain that I have is that it suffers from the gang up on the leader aspect that's common in area control games and this is due to the fact that the score is open for all players to see. Other than that an elegant design that stands the test of time! A true mastepiece that is easy to teach but hard to master. I highly recommmend the Big Box edition that has every expansion included!

The grandaddy of the modern area control Eurogame, and a great one at that.  The caballeros, power cards, action cards, provinces, court, regions...it all just comes together so beautifully.

RATING: 8
This was an interesting change of pace for my group. Normally we prefer resource gathering efficiency engine building titles like Puerto Rico, Race for the Galaxy or Agricola, but I dropped El Grande on them last night and we all had a pleasant experience. 

I prefer Shogun's added depth, and - though it in some ways 'makes' the game - the frequent special scoring actions bogged down the play for me. However, this criticism speaks more to my expectation of it offering a faster table dynamic than any inherent issue with the game. For what it is, El Grande is very subtle and elegant. It's one of those games that evokes a sense of depth one can't really fathom till they get into the experience. 

Perhaps my score will go up on future plays, but due to the pace and restricted player counts I have my doubts. 

(ps: It was definitely worth the $40 I paid for the  Rio Grande edition through boards and bits - I'd have been annoyed to pay $60+ retail for it though).

The problem,as mentioned, is that it's long, deep and only works with 4/5 pl. Also, due to very high interaction, tactics are employed instead of strategy (and considering this, the normal mode would take too long and the short mode is more suitable IMO. Why always plan for a short time frame if the game takes so long? Doesn't make sense.). Requires a lot of space, too.

4-5(5)

I thought this was an excellent game. A classic. The king nicely limits your placement options (and also adds a crucial element of trying to locate the king and then, of course, trying to snag some of those nicer action cards. Also a nice ebb and flow of units from the provinces to the courts to the board and then back again.

I realize now we played the turn order mechanism wrong (we passed the first bid to the left), which may well have changed much of the game (I cannot ascertain). Certainly a tangible "bash the leader" element.

Others have said that El Grande is obsoleted by newer titles (Chaos in the Old World and Dominant Species being two that get mentioned). CitOW is enjoyable enough, it's got really cool variable powers and win conditions and an interesting game arc, but the rules are a bear to follow and explain, along with randomness in the combat (which is key to Khorne's win condition).

I enjoy Dominant Species a lot, but the obvious thing is its length. I like the variable powers here too (much more subtle than in CitOW), but it's a bit different from El Grande, with the growing and changing landscape, as exploration occurs and resources enter and leave and tundra expands and populations migrate. El Grande is just so much more ... [i]Euro[/i] ... cleaner and a purer distillation of the area control.

Thoughts after a 5 players game:  Great area control game. I really liked the turn order bidding mechanic. There is a lot of tension and chaos because the action cards can really change the positions on the map. Turn order is crucial. The game lasts 9 turns and scoring happens after every 3 rounds.  The game feels very abstract and has the common problem of all area control games (bash the leader). I dont know if it plays equally well with any number of players.

Competitive area control game that blends a bidding mechanic for getting cards with the cutthroat nastier of area control games. 

Complexity - moderately high. You will understand the game after a few rounds but at first it may be confusing.

Strategy - high, a skilled player will be more successful but it is a war game and ganging up will make things drastically harder.

Luck - low, cards are drawn randomly from a pile and bidding is used every turn to aquire the cards but turn order is clockwise based off lowest bidder from the previous round. So seating position can be a factor.

Interaction - extreme, everything you do to help you is hindering others. You either get points for most influence or give it to others. There is no sharing.

Fun - more of a serious competitive game that can cause frustration with conflicts in regions.

I threatened to set this game on fire during my one play of it.  It felt like you only truly had 6 or so actions in a game.  If one of those actions was poorly planned, you sit and wait for the remainder of the players to take their turn while you twiddle your thumbs.

Overall a good game that i would be willing to play again.
The good
- Replayability.
- Implements the basic concept well.
- I like the simple but concise graphic design.
- Few short and clear rules. Always a plus!

The bad
- Kingmaking. The choice of the player who is last on the score, whether to use the action on the action card or not might potentially decide the winner. Not good. 
- Randomness might ruin attempted strategies before they take effect and without warning.
- Attacking other players' assets is not a viable long term strategy.

RATING: 9
A fun, challenging game.  A real "gamers' game" that demands a lot of concentration...if you plan to win.  I think this game is properly considered the granddaddy of many subsequent euro's (including Hansa Teutonica).  It utilizes so many mechanisms that other games subsequently incorporated.  I particularly love the way the turn order is determined in this game.  Way way back (was it 1995?), this was the first game to introduce me to the concept of structuring a game such that one element of the game would involve players competing to advantageously determine turn order.

RATING: 8
A tentative 8 with more plays required for a firm review. A simple game to teach as well as a deep and strategic challenge, which is a rare combination. An ever rarer bird since it's also a classic eurogame with a high degree of interaction. 

I wish this game were easier to find a copy of; I feel it would be rated higher if it were. 

Side note: El Grande is clearly the inspiration for newer card-driven area control games like Blood Rage, but it seems that the newer games haven't improved upon the classic. If anything, it shows that extra bells and whistles do not make for a better game (and also shows that fancy models and hype have an undue influence in the BGG top 100...)

The classic territory-controlling game. Elegant gameplay: easy to learn but hard to master. One complaint: I found it difficult to view the scoring track.

The spacing between scoring, game length, board, mechanics, etc. work great.  It's a leader bashing bonanza, though, and deck knowledge should be a factor in competitive play (e.g. "there's a 1-in-3 chance that I'll be able to score any region in the four pile next turn if I play the nut low here").  I'm still up for a game of it but I think I've swung fairly securely into the camp that thinks it's much improved with the K&I expansion.

An understandably well-liked area-majority game.  Game play is quick and the mix of cards makes replay high.  There is a bit of blind bid feel in the turn order determining card play.  Turn order is a critical factor to time and control (if possible).  Overall the game is lighter than one might expect and it tends to be a bit dry feeling.  The theme is not a critical part of the game.  Plays best when not played slowly.  [GTI: AGSL]

This game surprised me, I didn't think it would be as enjoyable as it was. The game focuses heavily on short term tactical decisions, what will benefit me the most right now or next turn. I would prefer something a bit more long term. I don't like the idea of the power cards, there should have been 5 fixed cards instead, like the roles in Puerto Rico.

A good game overall but I ended playing a card in the next to last turn that moved the guy in last place to first. Unfortunately that wasn't me but regardless I didn't like it that the game swung so much on one card.

RATING: 10
One of the best games ever. In comparison to Tigris and Euphrates it is much more intuitive and also less random. Rules are easy to learn. Area control game with a peculiar collection of elements that nonetheless work very well together. The components are very abstract - coloured wooden cubes, a weird giant chess pawn to represent the king, and a nice cardboard castle.

First off, I don't believe theme is necessary for a good game.  Still, throughout my playings of El Grande, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was just moving cubes around and scoring territories every few rounds.  It's classic, sure, but also repetitive and dry.

I understand that this game is a "granddaddy game" or whatever you want to call it, but it doesn't really stand out to me as anything particularly special. I mean, it isn't *bad*, except from the inability to really reign in a runaway leader, it just isn't amazing.

There are good points to it: The components are great, the general strategy is nice, the art is kind of cool... it just didn't do it for me. 

Frankly, this is lucky. I don't need another "grail game" to attempt to hunt down. In most cases, I would rather play Dominant Species (although DS is certainly more difficult to teach.)

Having been so long since I first played El Grande, I was intrigued if my negative sentiment about the game would remain. But, like most area-control games, I ultimately found the experience lackluster. Which made me wonder... why? After all, there are a handful of area-control games that I do enjoy. And there are many games, which have an area control element, that I absolutely love (and I don't consider the area-control element a weakness). 

As I wrestled with this question... I believe it comes down to one thing. That is, area-control games often break down into bash-the-leader exercises where the game-state continuously reverts back. In other words, the puzzle, for which the game is, doesn't change in a significant/meaningful way. It's generic... samey... and ultimately boring. 

Granted, this isn't the only reason I dislike El Grande. For instance, the blind-selection for scoring is a mechanic I'll never enjoy. But when I'm playing a game, I'm looking for an interesting puzzle. And when I'm playing El Grande, I'm struck with a feeling of deja vu; the round marker has moved, the VP are different, but the puzzle feels the same.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
WOW! Where has this game been all of my life? This game strikes a good balance is so many different ways. The theme strikes me as quite right for a game of this type: present enough to give you enough metaphors to understand the play, but it stand back and allows to players to go play the game and make their own stories. The rules are simple to teach and to play, but again it gives the players enough room to understand and calculate their moves in a reasonable amount of time. There's a lot of interaction, and much of it 'mean' (and often memorable), yet I never felt it was too heavy-handed. I like the purity of the game play, with many of it's successors have combined the area-majority scoring with something else (e.g. Belfort = area-majority + worker-placement!, etc.).

Sad to see this out-of-print; hopefully it will see the light of day again, and I'll be first in line to get the first copy.

El Grande is a fast-moving, but deep game of strategy.  It's got a good balance of player interaction, enjoyable decicions, and random elements to keep things fresh.

So far all of the games I've played have moved along really quickly which is a bonus, especially since the end of the game comes around pretty fast without feeling like the conclusion was rushed.

Loved this game from the first minute I opened the box, saw the components - the tower is very cool -  and read the rules. There is not one thing I don't like about this game except the amount of play I get of it. I have played this solo quite a few times to scratch that itch (super sad -  I know). Took my game group a game or two to get over the 'what the hell am I doing, is this a good move?' hump BUT after two games they want me to 'shut up - we don't want/need your advice' GREAT GAME!

Bár a Jubileumi van meg, itt hagyom a véleményemet ennél a kiadásnál, mert amikor írtam még nem volt fenn többféle verzió... egyébként meg kezd tele lenni a tököm vele, hogy lassan minden kiadást külön feltesznek a BGG-re.
---
Nagyon megelőzi a korát... Kifejezetten jó, szeretnék játszani még vele!! Nekem úgy ajánlották, hogy ez az a játék, ahol meg lehet fordítani a vesztett partit is. És tényleg, nagyon váratlan fordulatok is lehetnek, ennek ellenére elviselhető a szerencse szerepe szerintem.
A szabály meglepően egyszerű és rövid (külön dícséret: nagyon kevés szabály van ilyen egzaktul és tömören leírva, kb. 20 perc, minden elsőre világos), mégis elég mély a játék. Néhány kis apróság biztosítja az árnyalatokat, és adja a nehézséget: a király, a kastély, a mozgatható pontozók, és a Grandék... A titkos választási korong pedig a játék jelképe is lehetne.
Egyik játékostársam kritikai észrevétele: a pontozásban megjelenhetne, hogy kinek milyen erőkártyája maradt meg. Ha Knizia készítette volna, tuti számítana ez is:)

Azért csak ~9 pontot adok a játékra, hogy legyen ürügy még játszani, hátha lesz még jobb is:) Amúgy is szeretném kipróbálni 4-5 fővel, állítólag öten a legjobb.

4-en is kipróbáltuk, így jobbnak tűnt, mint 3-an.

Wow, this game has been around for 18 years before hitting the table at my gaming night!
How did I miss such a great design for all this time?

This is the archetype of area majority games, with simple and straightforward rules, but with so much interaction and cut-throatness that it doesn't seem a german game! It is probably my favorite of the games of the 90s!

I can feel its greatness with the full compliment of 5 players, and I guess it loses something with less (I can't see it hitting the table with less than 4)... but it is indeed a great design, and I can't wait to play it again!

Update december 20th, 2012: this is definitely one of the best 5-player game around, vote raised to 9.

I've got mixed feelings about this one. It plays smoothly and does the area majority mechanic quite nicely, but I've really seen it drag on. I don't think it is worth playing with less than 4 players, especially when you own Belfort for 3 and Louis XIV for 2. Even so I may choose either of those games over a 4 player game of El Grande. I'd like to get some more plays of it and maybe start incorporating the expansions, too.

RATING: 10
The best of the area control games (and I suck at it), but I still enjoy playing.  (Yes I know all about the high-low tactic and lots of other "suggested" tactics, but somehow other people's moves manage to screw up whatever I try).

Have tried various expansions and find that vanilla is still the best - the chaos level is about right; most of the expansions become rapidly chaotic and the player has even less control over his destiny.

El Grande is subject to kingmaking, which normally turns me off, but for some reason I accept it in this game.  I prefer it with 4+ players. Although the base game is favored by most, I prefer variety.

The main downside to El Grande is that players are at the mercy of the current round of action cards.   Although players can anticipate future actions, any attempt at a longterm plan is hazy... especially since 2 unknown action cards from each stack will not be used.   


[b]Intrigue & the King[/b]
I enjoy the customizable aspect of choosing your own action cards.  I also like that you don't have to read 4 stacks of action cards at the beginning of each round.  Currently, I highly prefer the Intrigue & the King cards to the base game. 


[b]Grand Inquisitor[/b] 
My recommendation is to use every new feature.  The Colonies (France, America, & the Mediterranean) add new, unique scoring opportunities that are safe from the secret disc selection of the Castillo!  The Grand Inquisitor, his little henchmen, and the Limit Table are not to be underestimated.  The biggest impact on the game however, is the Ship.  It allows a player to place Caballeros on any coastal region!  
  

[b]Grandissimo[/b]
I recommend setting aside 8 of the stack six action cards, so that some of the more unbalanced cards are removed.  The Ship, Jail, Queen, Jester, and Portugal improve upon the base game... so long as you remove a few of the stack 6 cards.


I have created an expansion variant:

My favorite German boardgame. Great player interaction, tough decisions and a combination of tactics and strategie. To which area the caballeros from El Castillo are going is probably the most exciting element of the game.

Still a great, classic game but there are some many great games nowadays.* Update: Dropped to an eight.

A clever area influence struggle, better with the max 5 players. Between the card plays, the number of influence markers, the scoring order, and the power cards there are enough factors to keep your mind busy. With a bit of cooperation it is possible to catch up to an early leader. I'm trying to decide if Maharaja is better at the same game. The one factor in favor of El Grande is the difficulty in catching up to a leader in Maharaja.

So far I've only played a handful of times, but each game play has been an exceptional experience.  The power card component, as well as the option of either moving cabelleros to your court or to the board, along with the uncertainty of the castillo and where the occupying caballeros will end up, all add up to a balanced, enjoyable, intriguing game.  Replay value is very high. [Market price]

This is a tricky and fun territorial game. Each territory is worth different points and usually worth points to more then 1 single player. The player with most units in an area will be awarded the most points and the player with 2nd most 2nd most points and so on. The game consists of 9 rounds of which 3 are rounds who after they are finished you will be awarded points for all the areas on the board in which you have units. The goal is to in the end have been awarded most points through all 9 rounds and end up the victor with the largest grand total.

Ofcourse the game includes twists such as actioncards that can award extra points or award points before one of the 3 "award rounds" take place. To make things even more interesting there is a giant castle in which you can place units instead of in an area on the board. these units are kept blind until one of the "award rounds" come into action. (Round 3,6,9 are the award rounds). When this happens it will first secretly be determined in which area the player of the hidden units wish them to go on the board to shift the balance in that particular area before points from areas are determined. This can give an hidden advantage but units placed this way can only tip the scales of one single area where other players might have spread their units across the board and if lucky can be awarded most or 2nd most points in more areas then 1.

This proved great with 4 players and we only played the basic version of the game. It is a strategic, knaving aswell as a diplomatic game.

First game I played left a very bad taste in my mouth... but all the other players had played before.  My second game (just played) was much better as I had a far better idea of what was going on.  Consequently, my rating has gone up as I can see some of the underlying game instead of marvelling at how everything I did was wrong.  I would like to play again, but somehow this one never comes out in our group.

Lives up to the hype.  Area control mixed with action drafting and a couple interesting twists vis-a-vis the king and castillo.  First play with five was fascinating, and felt right up my alley.  Ran a bit long on the first play, 2.5 hrs, but it was worthwhile and I think everyone enjoyed it even if a bit tired out by the end.  This and Imperial are my two favorite takes on the genre, edging out Small World and Nexus Ops, although each has its place.  The beauty of the game is in its simplicity.

[url=http://ballearicus.blogspot.com/2008/05/el-grande-y-reef-encounter.html]El grande[/url] es un juego familiar de mayorías (o control de áreas) sencillo, fácil de jugar y de aprender. El tema realmente es lo de menos, ya que la sensación que tuve mientras lo jugaba era de estar moviendo cubitos de un sitio a otro. Lo jugamos 4 jugadores y no tuvimos ningún problema para hacernos con el desde el principio. El juego transmite tensión y grandes dosis de confrontación directa ya que las cartas pueden alterar la puntuación y mover los cubitos del contrario. La incertidumbre de la torre me parece un gran acierto.

Rápido y ágil de duración moderada, se jugó en hora y media en nuestra primera partida, creo que se puede acortar bastante en las venideras.

This game is brilliant. Every turn you are confronted with mulitple tough decisions. Do you get pieces into your courts? or choose what action to use? Do you choose for the action? or the number of pieces you get to place. Where do you put them? Do you advance your position? or hinder your opponents? These sort of decision are the bread and butter of this brilliant area-control game.

However, I don't see how the game is even nearly as good with less than 5 people as it takes away so much of the 'least of many evils' feel to each decision.

Superb tactical area control game. One of the best in it's kind and definitely a classic. Managing the cubes combined with bidding for turn order is a brilliant mechanic that will let you face a difficult decision every turn. The order in which the different actions come up makes for a different game everytime.

Must remember to put cubes in the Castillo. Must learn strategies for bidding.

I don't think the quality of the reprint is as bad as peple say. The card quality seemed crappy, but the box and board have a nice linen finish. I like the large turn example sheet.

Next Strategy to try: "Playing cards with a alternating value of middle-low-high, middle-low-high, middle-low-high is often a good idea, because it allows you to (hopefully) control the placement of the King before each scoring round (or, once, at the very least)."

Summary
Randomly determine starting province for grandes. randomly determine player to bid first. Player chooses card between 1-13. Card also determines how many troops will be pulled from the provinces to the courts. Bids chosen going clockwise. Highest bidder get first choice of special action/1-5 troop placement. Player may place in province next to King (but not in King province) or in Castillo. Score majorities after round 3, 6 & 9.

A classic that employs auction and area control mechanics. It is tight, tense, brutal and chaotic, but there is an elegance and brilliance that shines through. There are some games that have come out later that employ similar mechanics (Dominant Species and Chaos in the Old World come to mind), but this classic still retains a charm that is irreplaceable. 

Yes, there is chaos and a bash the leader element, but it is all kept in control and it fits well with the gameplay. It probably shines the best with a full complement of five players.

With it's excellent and polished gameplay, El Grande is worthy of it's high accolades here on the Geek.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A great game when played with 4 or 5. Definitely a game where players are heavily affected by each others moves therefore making the game more tactical rather than strategic. It does suffer from a bash the leader effect, and king making at the end of the game can happen.  For these reasons the score is not higher.

I got this game after owning settlers and carc, I would recommend it to people in a similar situation. At that time it blew my mind!

If someone from Hans im Glück ever reads this: How about instead of releasing the next Big Box edition, this game gets a much needed face lift? In particular some artwork for the cards would be nice, but the map would also greatly benefit from a different color palette. Maybe reboot the game with a different theme and the much beloved card expansion already included?

One of the best area control games so far, but oh my gosh is it dry! Do not even try to introduce this game to strangers, they will probably leave the table as soon as they see the box art/map/colour palette. Also has some issues with with the player count, which is why Inis is my go to area control game for now, although the core game of this one probably is better. Unfortunately I can't always get 5 people to the table.

I've watched other playing this at a game night when I got there a little bit late.  Now I just need to find enough people to play to make it good.

Update 10/4/2011: I played this for the first time today as a 2p.  I wasn't expecting it to work well for two, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I really enjoyed the game, and can see how it would absolutely shine with more players.  Based on my first play of this, I give it a solid 8.

Although it doesn't play like Risk, I find that it can be a good transition game for Risk fans.  It looks similar and is about area control.  There are many tough decisions in this game.  It is a Euro game with a fair amount of "take that!"  Because of the "take that," I don't get to play this with my familyish group as much as I'd like.

After 1 and a half years, I played this again and it did not disappoint.  All the ebb and flow of scoring you'd expect with some exciting twists, especially at the finish.  Final scores in the 4 player game were close with 1st and 2nd separated by 1 point and a tie for third just 5 points or so behind.  Fantastic!

Another play and I find this game is only getting better after eight plays.  It's one of the best.

I'll never suggest it, but I'll play. It's not a bad game, but very dry. It is  possible to get hurt by the card draw. In fact, I think it's inevitable that soemone will get hurt by the card draw. There's only so much you can do to control the order of play and if the cards fall wrong a turn or two, you'll be dragging up the rear the rest of the game.

a very promising game, but too abstract. should have better cards that captures its theme the way later games like Twilight Struggle, 1960, and 2 De Mayo do. castillo is almost unnecessary, in the sense that concealment does not improve the game beyond adding a memory test dimension.

Too much blue in the color palette.  I have the decennial edition with the misprinted cards, and it's just fine.  While I wish the text on those few cards hadn't been truncated, it's no big deal and doesn't affect play.

One of my favorites. Simplistic rules, difficult strategy. I do well until it's time to paratroop into a territory. I always talk myself out of my first choice and end up doing several points worse than I would have if I'd stuck with it. Works best with 5, though 4's good, too. With fewer players the bidding part is kind of pointless, and to me that's half the challenge. The conflict of the bidding with 5 players is awesome.

This has shown its age, recently, for me. I need to get it to the table the next time we have 5.

Edit: After another play, yeah, its a solid 8, and a grandaddy of the area majority set. It could so easily have devolved into a chaotic free-for-all, but the subtle restrictions on your actions are enough to make it a game of increasing your own position, vs. harming others, for the most part. Some targeting of the leader, when you have a choice, is pretty much always gonna be necessary.

What can be said that hasn't been said?  Every serious gaming collection should have a copy of this game.  The quintessential area majority game, El Grande packs a lot of punch with a simple rules framework, making it quite suitable for semi-gamers despite the dry theme.

I can definitely see where some may not like the leader-bashing; El Grande is almost like a Euro-ized Risk where instead of rolling dice to kill of your opponents you merely score for having more units than them.  The game is about on the edge of what I find acceptable.  There are definitely games where an early leader gets absolutely crushed and it can make for a demoralizing, unfun experience.  It's also slightly too long and the game can drag.

That said, this is probably my favorite negotiation game and that's mostly because it is NOT explicitly a negotiation game.  The tension and downfall of your opponents after a particularly nasty castillo maneuver is why I play games.  Still one of the best games ever despite its flaws.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Simply great game.  Wonderful strategic elements and several different ways to achieve a win.  There is some luck with card turns, but mostly luck free.  The only problem stems from when one player doesn't know what they are doing, but I suppose that's true for most games ;)  

In regards to the Intrigue and the King expansion: After playing the original so many times, this definitely adds to it and makes it a somewhat new game.  I don't like the Grand Inquisitor and the Colonies expansion as it seems to clutter up the game too much.

I can't figure the best movements in this game, 3 plays and still overhelming me.

I'm starting to think this is no as good as I thought first time when I knew less games... maybe is because I'm terrible at this game and since that I don't enjoy it... thinking in trading it away.

Finally traded. At least some friends own it... so it's strange I regret.

A light wargame involving territory control.  The fact that you can move the king or caballeros _ANYWHERE_ on the board with the cards that provide those actions is a huge deal.  I tend to agree with a buddy of mine who thinks that the card that lets you move the king and place 5 caballero (the card that stays out for each round) is probably too powerful.  Being able to shoot and run is the issue (i.e. place caballeros to take over a region, and then move the king to the opposite side of the board, leaving opponents no chance to fight back).  With all of the praise that this game gets, this card and the movement rules probably work just fine and are balanced with experienced players... but it doesn't change the fact that I don't like chaos caused by the "wide open" movement rules.

A classic! This is the definitive area control game and I've finally managed to play it. 

El Grande is a really good game and the concepts are simple. The bidding mechanism balances turn order against the number of cubes you can make available for potentially placing on the board. There's a seperate card choice bit that determines how many of these cubes actually get placed, which is neat. The cards have another use too, there will be a more "random" effect that each card can cause. Do you pick the one you really want or pick another to prevent someone else using it to damage you. This is another clever aspect of the game.

I also like the fact that you have a range of cards to use in bidding and no player can use the same number as someone else.

All the mechanics tend to have balace as a plus somewhere is balanced by a minus somewhere else. The luck of the draw in the order in which the cards turn up (or which ones you don't see) is the only really random part of the game.

I hope I get to play this again soon.

RATING: 7
A great game that I'm always up for, if using the basic rules.

However, I've tried it using expansions, and I'm much less fond of them.

The expansion with the player-designed decks I'm totally uninterested in playing - I would prefer to go read a book, or something. No appeal at all.

The expansion which increases the map, adding new territories is better. It doesn't detract from the game, but I'd rather not use it, as it doesn't seem to add much, either.

So, in summary, I love El Grande, and think the expansions are a big mistake.

Area control classic. My lack of success in this game was getting beyond a joke, but its elegance kept drawing me back. Doesn't come out much, but that's probably because I prefer it with 5 players (not a common number in my group). 
***UPDATE*** After playing recently I've downgraded it to a 6. Quite simply, it's mean. That's okay in a short, light game with plenty of trash talking, but it doesn't quite fit here. Still elegant though...

A great game: nice theme; good pieces; good, easy and complete rules. And hardly any luck either.

It doesn't get a 8.5 since I think it is a 5 player game, that can be played with 3 or 4. But not playing with 5 introduces a lot of risk management instead of resource management and I dont feel that should be part of the game, especially since it isn't there with 5 players.

A very well constructed area influence game that uses a lot of clever design hooks to drive the play forward. My main concern and reason for withholding a higher rating is that it seems a sterile exercise. The game mechanics are constantly in your face and there is no sense that you are engaged in the unification of Spain (or anywhere else for that matter). I readily admit to be a stickler for theme - as often as not the theme is what draws me to a game in the first place and, given a decent implementation, what keeps me there. This hasn't kept me...

Fun game but wasting valuble chances in scoring VPs will leave you in the dirt if youre not careful.  Its a lovely board. The box is a bit over sized to allow for storage of the castille which could have been smaller.

Area control Euro and the first one of that type I played.  While it's beautiful and interesting, El Grande isn't much fun.  After a while it wears out it's welcome and you want it to just end.

One of the best games I&#039;ve every played. It sets itself apart from most in that each game is a fixed 9 turns long, that movement of resources is slow and commitments are high and the only uncertainty and luck involved are the actions of your fellow players. In my experience best played with four. Five gets a little less predictable and fewer a little more so.

RATING: N/A
After my only play of this game (a few years ago), I could see how everything worked together.  Nice meshing of mechanisms, but it would take me at least another play to use any strategy.  Based on this game really needing five players to shine (from what I've read), I am unlikely to buy this one because I don't run come into contact with four other people who would want to play it nearly enough.  Would play occasionally, but I don't feel the need to own it.

Juego de dominación de áreas por mayorías. Tiene más estrategia de la que pueda parecer y es uno de los favoritos de mi ludoteca.  La edición Decennial incluye las tres expnasiones más importantes.

De momento solo he probado la de "la intriga y el rey" y básicamente, proporciona un método alternativo de escoger acciones y meter caballeros de las cortes a los territorios. Intuyo que la expansión ofrece un cambio más significativo para partidas de cuatro o cinco jugadores. Yo solo lo he probado a tres.

Decent area-control game. I really liked how streamlined the game is: there aren't a bunch of set up and cleanup steps after each round, and it's certainly not a point-salad. All good things. However overall the game felt bland, from presentation and components, to theme, to the kinds of choices and their impacts that come each round. There just didn't seem to be "juicy choices". Granted, this was a first play, but I wonder if game design has just advanced enough in the last 20 years that except for a few true classics, games from this era just don't hold up as well.

I love this game for its mechanisms AND for its presentation, dammit! I'm someone who actually does enjoy the theme, and as a carcassonne fan I love the board. I do even like the cubes... and who couldn't love that black imposing castillo? The game is fast, full of tension and great decisions, and though it always seems to be a heavier game than I remembered when I'm teaching it to new folks, by the time we score for the first time everyone is vetoing, and groaning at action choices, counting their court of cabillero's and staring at the Castillo trying to remember just how many red cubes are in there. Excellent, though yes, not overly pretty and full of shiny bits, but as someone who has grown to love area control, this game is a gem. I lament that this game is just dry enough that my group usually isn't interested, though I still need to try a 5 player game, as I hear those can be sublime.

One of the all time classics of area-control games. With the right group dynamics, a 4 or 5 player game is highly engaging. Love the ebbs of power control.

Reasonably fun game but maybe I am just passed these area control games. Ultimately arbitrary lottery experience in who wins with so many ways to stop someone with cards, kingmaking, swings, roundabouts or just simply targeting them. I tied for win in my first game but felt I had done nothing to deserve or warrant this other than just trying to avoid the wrath of others. A fair amount of AP and downtime with the wrong players as well.

Good game, with lots of very tense moments, from the mad rush to pick the action cards, to the anxious experience of watching what other players do with them, to the uncertainty one feels when finally revealing the Castillo... all of which makes for an excellent game.

However: the "take-that" feel of the cards, and the push-and-pull nature of the gameplay, not to mention the game's sometimes wildly unpredictable upheavals, combine to make this not great for our gaming group (especially as area control is not our favorite mechanic). If I want to play a game similar to this, I'd pick something a little shorter and less chaotic, like [thing=29937][/thing] or [thing=165986][/thing].

Dry, abstract game.  Unengaging.  Kingmaker problem as it usually boils down to 2 or 3 people in the running for the win, which is obvious to all by the second to last turn, and the remaining players have good ability to affect the outcome with their last few turns.

Best-with-5.  My favourite game. Decisions to be made at every step of the game. Everything is so perfectly balanced. Short turns in different phases.  Can be played tactically, but it gets better when you develop a strategy.  A tiny bit of randomness to keep the game different each time that you play.
I also own the El Grande Expansions but those end up adding a little too much and don't enhance the game - just make it different and a little longer.  El Grande on its own is just an awesome, awesome game.

Finally played the granddaddy of the area influence games, and found myself in deep awe of the old coot.  I can't wait to play this game again.
UPDATE:  What a difference a few years, and a hundred or so games, make.  I have very little desire to play this again as a recent outing left me cold.  It's not bad - it just doesn't resonate the way it used to.  Maybe games like Twilight Struggle have stripped me of the requisite excitement over bare bones area influence.  I wonder if Wallenstein is next on my 'uh-oh, I don't love this anymore' train.

Kramer strikes again - a classic.  Area control may seem overdone nowadays but this was new, fresh and exciting at the time.  And was it also the first game to have the score-track round the outside?  Quite routine now but also innovative at the time I think.

What an excellent and elegant game! Can be a brain burner that leaves me tired at the end of the night, but each game has been different for my friends and I, and a lot of fun. The mechanics of this game are the best I've played--I always enjoy bidding for turn order, and the five card choices are usually balanced--and if you're down in this game, you're rarely out.

RATING: 9
[09/06/05 and 31/12/07]Together with In the Shadow of the Emperor my favourite eurogame. 

However, I would not want to play the game without the König & Intrigant expansion. Even with newbies, playing with that expansion is IMO preferable. In that case, just take the same five cards out of each player's deck. Simple. 

Großinquisitor & Kolonien is a great addition I heartily recommend to those who've at least once played the basic game.

Whereas G&K adds more, the König & Intrigant expansion streamlines the game, increases player control and correspondingly dramatically reduces the luck factor.

K&I resembles the "advanced game" of Torres in that it gives you a full hand of possible actions to pick - rather than picking them on the go. Not surprising to see the same principle at work considering both are Kramer designs. 

Once having played El Grande with the K&I expansion, there's really no looking back to the basic game. Mandatory expansion, IMO.

If El Grande is to your liking, I recommend checking out Im Schatten des Kaisers for a yet more strategic offering.

I'll need a few more plays. Plenty of little tactical choices to think about and will reward thoughtful play.

A seminal game design which sets the stage for Eurogame design every year following.  This game is the first and best implementation of area control, bidding for turn order, and card drafting of variable turn options.  The game flows through ever changing temporary alliances and possible back stabbing.  "We are partners in this province but, I will turn against you in that province."An important boardgame and worthy of play by every board gamer.And, by the way, it's great fun.

I'm not all that convinced this game is any more than a table random mess.  I understand it is the godfather of area majority games.  But the card availability is random, your ability to play a card is random, and the shuffling of the cubes around by the other players can help you or hurt you without a person having all that much to say about it.  Not to say it isn't fun, or isn't a classic.  It's just not going to be chosen by me over other area majority/control games like San Marco or In the Shadow of the Emperor.

The classic old-school German game: Very abstracted, but with clean rules and intuitive gameplay that belie its depth. Never has pushing cubes around a board been so much fun. From other comments, I thought this would have much more luck/chaos than it does. Awesome with 5, probably close to a 10. I think it works fine with 3 or 4, maybe rated 8 with 4 and a 7 with 3. The only problem is that it can be tough to catch up, but that's never been something that's bothered me in games.

I have played a lot of area control games over the years, and I always end the game questioning why we just don't play El Grande instead. Never surpassed.

One of my favorites of all time, never gets old. I have the Big Box but still haven't gotten around to playing with the expansions because the base game is so great as it is. Side note: they really skimped on the castillo in the Big Box edition. Doesn't affect game play but still...thin cardboard vs particle board. I will never turn down a game of El Grande. Easy to teach, takes one play to get the hang of it. A classic!

RATING: 6
Still not a favorite of mine. Most of the action cards involve a pretty harsh way to "screw your neighbor". There is too much nastiness in this game for my taste. Also, on the 1st & 2nd turn, some of the cards may cause major damage to a player who is not even out of the starting blocks, nor able to do anything to prevent it. Though, some threads contend that against 4 veteran players, a player who gains 25 VP will still lose, if the other four focus on harshing the leader. And then the one of the four wins, who rises most from the muck. So, what's the point of any VP on the first couple turns?

Admittedly, I'm a hypocrit because my favorite games, Titan & Power Grid, arguable have these same characteristics, so there you go.

RATING: 9
El Grande is one of the best area majority games if not THE best! Such an old game, yet I don't think it shows its age at all. 

To me, this game has awesome mechanics throughout the entire game. The betting mechanic for the cards is great; if you bid low, you get more caballeros in your court to place now or later, but you also end up with one of the worst cards which will have a small impact. You are going to start the next round so you can play a 13 if you really want to get a card. 
On the other hand, if you make a high bid, you will get the card you want but will need caballeros in your court from previous rounds. You will go last in the next round, which balances it, but it's actually not that bad to be the last one as you can see what the others have played and play a card in between the other numbers.
So, even though the highest cards are best, you need to play some low cards too in order to get caballeros to place, and it's delightful to plan when to use which card!

The Castillo is a pretty good idea as it introduces a little bit of randomness and can spoil other players' plans. 
The movement of the king and his impact on the entire game is great too!

It is simply a must-have board game in my opinion and it plays very well with 3 players, great with 4 players and fantastic with 5 players. 
This game is a masterpiece and my favorite area majority game by far! I always want to play it and I suspect this will never change!

RATING: 10
Easy to learn (from sample game card supplied) or to teach. Quality components. I'd bought other euros before this one but El Grande bowled me over with its clever and original mechanics and beautiful board.

A pity it's now only available in "Big Box" format with six unwanted expansions and an £80 price tag! What a rip-off! I much prefer the earlier edition as I only want to play the base game and I usually play brown and that colour has been replaced by pink in the new edition.

Incredibly fun game if you have 4-5 players (have not tried it with less, but looks like it would reduce the edge somewhat of the game).

Picking the cards, when to use the Castillo, when to move the king, etc, play extremely well to an already good choice of basic actions.

It is also simple to teach and to understand, but hard to master. This is a game of good strategy and knowing your opponents. Love it!

RATING: 7
The basic rules system is simple:  bid on the right to choose a card, move men into your court, then follow the instructions on the card and move men onto the board (in either order.)  Every three rounds, there's a scoring round with scores determined by area majority.  The complexity comes from figuring out which card can do the most for you, and they're all different.  I find the game interesting in principle, but for some reason our games always get out of control, they bog down in the middle, people get distracted.  Seems like it should move briskly in principle but it never does.  Also, a big gang-up-on-the-leader element.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Probably my favorite game right now, unfortunately it doesn't hit the table that often becuase it really needs 5 players (IMO...although I haven't tried 4, it just doesn't seem like it would work nearly as well).  This is one of those games that I knew I would like it as soon as I read the rules (unlike many Knizia games).  Just enough chaos to keep it from being overly analyzed, but planning is rewarded.  Also, you are never out of it, as a couple of scoring cards in your favor can make up a lot of ground in a hurry.

I usually do not do well in area control games, and maybe for that reason I enjoy very few of them.  But for some reason I just "get" El Grande when I play it.  How something can be so open-ended and yet stay so balanced with a full group of 5 players is an absolute mystery to me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
El Grande is the venerable classic of area control that still laughs at its more recent pretenders to the throne. This is euro gaming at its finest, with plenty of tough decision making, unique and interesting mechanics, and direct messing with other players.

The game would be pretty boring if it wasn't for the various decks of cards that provide just enough shakeup factor to mix up the board without having things devolve into randonmess. Every turn, you get to jockey for turn order and decide how important that display of cards is for your current and future round. 

If you have five players, this game is ideal. It's a game I always enjoy playing, and I can't ever see this game leaving my collection. Wonderful stuff.

Update: after playing the base game 10 times, we finally broke out the King and Intrigue expansion in the decennial edition. Very interesting to see an entirely new implementation of turn order and action options. Good stuff... a legitimate alternate way to play the game, but the group agreed it is probably best with five.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A classic, elegant in its simplicity. Play a card to determine turn order, take one of the 5 actions, and then place some meeples on the board. Every 3 rounds score points and that's it. In my first game I did horrible because I focused on more powerful cards, which meant I could not put out as many meeples as others, and I think that really hurt me when it came to scoring each time. It's so easy to teach so everyone picks it up quickly and with how tight the board is the game is very interactive and vicious moving meeples around to try and improve your scoring and hurting someone else. I wasn't as enamored after my first play, but that is likely based on how poorly I did and definitely want to play it again because it is so easy to pick up.

I have only played once and it was a very enjoyable game. The game is pretty easy to get into, but is very deep. Almost too deep. It is difficult to keep track of all the things needed to score and if you get behind it is too hard to come back. There is no forgiveness in this game.

This game is indicative of what I've grown tired of in designer games.  A dry abstract, along the "place your painted cubes here and there" lines.  The theme is tacked on and tactics dominate over strategy.  After 6 plays (and 4 wins) I can honestly say I don't care if I ever play it again.

RATING: 6
(7-8-10 First impression) As a general matter, I’m not a huge fan of hidden but trackable information, so the cards and the castillo are not my favorite mechanisms. Nor do I typically enjoy simultaneous action selection, so the wheels for castillo placement (and other uses) aren’t a hit. While these mechanisms detract from the game as a serious game, they enhance the fun factor. But if the game is supposed to be fun, then it seems the min-max calculations for influence placement and the asymmetrical value calculation of the actions are a bit out of place. I’m not sure yet whether I like the hybrid of fun and heavy. I’ll have to see on further plays, but the heavy seems to undo the fun and the fun seems to undo the heavy.

I AM fine with the randomness of the available actions. Their asymmetrical values add a lot of interest to turn order play. A concern that may come up over time is that the asymmetries can be such that no one wants to throw themselves on a bomb, but everyone should. I suppose this just makes earlier actions more valuable. We’ll see.

The big lesson coming out of my first game was that you’ve got to balance your card play: low cards for future turn order and getting caballeros in your court and high cards to get the actions you need and the influence on the board. Moving the king seems to be a very powerful play, particularly right before scoring since you can assure yourself the extra points as well as play influence to key surrounding provinces. The castillo was much more important than I imagined since the points score AND the influence can go anywhere to score again. Also, making sure you keep you Grande scoring seems to be important.

Is there value in concentrating on a single value type to try to take advantage of the ‘score all the x’ actions? Or perhaps drafting behind in a bunch and letting the other players score them for you with their actions? Hm.

Overall, I felt there was a bit too much chaos swirling about to make this a good heavy game for me. But now that I've had a chance to think about it, I'll approach it a bit more like I do Manila : fun and random game with quite a bit of meat on it.

Played the danish version a lot when it first came out. The theme seems to pasted on but the rules seem o.k. at first. Then after a few games we came to realize how there's often a point where on player has reached the upper hand, and the game now just drags on till the bitter end, with all excitement gone. Don't get why people go crazy about this game. Boring, boring,boring.

Surprisingly intricate.  More of an experience game than a competitive game due to lack of control, multi-player chaos, lack of look-ahead etc.  Chaotic and almost entirely unpredictable past ~1 turn out.  My rating suffers is primarily due to the fact that I simply don't enjoy the game much (I find the cards too random), and I far too rarely have or get opportunity to play with the more interesting expansions which remove the random factors.

I mostly look at El Grande as Cosmic Encounter wrapped in German clothing.  In truth it is a little better than that, but not much, perhaps enough to scrape El Grande up to a 3.5-4.0 rating versus 2.5 for Cosmic Encounter.

First playings favorable, perhaps rating could go up over time.  Incredibly tense game with lots of tactics and some strategy.  The conflict aspect of this one could definitely get under my skin, some games just have a knack at doing that.  I tend to like those sorts of games, but I have to ration them out.  Due to this and Princes of Florence, Kramer stands as my favorite game designer.  

UPDATE:  I have no idea why, really, but this one just hasn't seen much play.  I have a feeling that when my group finally plays it again, we'll play it a number of times in rapid succession.

Classic area control game.  Funny about El Grande and I'm not talking about the king figure... :)  Is the first time I played I didn't understand the game and hated it.  Several years later I had the chance to play again with 5 players, who explained the game much better and I instantly feel in love.  This game has an excellent blend of tactics and strategy rolled into one; that it is not surprising of the high ranking.

Had it, traded it away, had it again (plus expansions) and traded it away (again). For me, this game has its highes and lows - sometimes I'll really be in the mood to play it, and sometimes not really. I enjoy how the game minimizes luck and also how it has alot of tactical decisions in deciding 1) which card to play (to determine your turn), 2) determine which action choice to chose, and 3) determine where to place your caballeros. I think the  biggest reason why I keep trying to get and trade away the game is the difficulty (or rather impossibilty) to get 4 - 5 people to play, which is the area in which this game really shines.

RATING: 8
10+ plays - juggling on quicksand - a gaming feast. The 3 player game (with three less phases) can go so fast - finished in something like 40 minutes (or less).Played "Intrigue & the King" (4p) and enjoyed it a lot. Was just over 2 hrs with learning. Lost by one point! Played "Grand Inquisitor & the Colonies" (4p), loved it (though 3hrs + long?), and had my mojo working. I liked some parts of the Grandissimo expansion (3p) although the card set introduced perhaps too many variables... The Grandissimo deck's imaginative set of card powers sometimes required careful cube counting and recounting to determine optimal play, slowing down the pace sometimes. Also I don't see the point of the Jester ability. Consensus of my gaming pals is that the base game is the best. But maybe pickin' and choosin' a few elements from the expansions is a strong option. Based on one play of the various expansions I like the Inquisitor the best, and I think the personal set of power cards/turn order cards is well done. I also like the additional land regions and the pick up/deliver of the Colonies. Probably all of the expansions add to game time, but for me it never dragged.

RATING: 7.7
Solid euro. Lots of abstract. But not as "abstract" as other abstracts....(?)

It's nice to have a game that looks big and imposing and scary (this does!) that you can STILL have a big impact on. Each player can choose to move the king marker which locks off a portion of the board. So it gives the feeling of empowerment to all players, even though some are obviously superior to others. I like that.

It's hard to salvage a losing position in this game, but it is one that involves a lot of guessing and sussing out other players motives which in turn, inspires good table talk and feelings of comradeship between players. I like that too :)

Must play more.

A euro with heavy conflict.  I had been underwhelmed by Smallworld (a light area control game) and was not all that enthusiastic to play El Grande as I was told it was the grand daddy of area control.  Wow, was I blown away when I finally played.  This game is so well balanced and every decision feels like it has benefits and drawbacks.  A word of warning: don't play with an angry gamer.

I'm just not a huge fan of area control games so it is hard to be objective.  But it is a well thought out game with enough options to keep you fully engaged.  I suppose I like this game well enough to play, but it is not a favourite.  It is more tactical than strategic with players responding to the card options rather than planning ahead.  All in all, I never complain when this is what comes out at games night.

RATING: 9
I really like this game.  But I am afraid my bias towards Spain (I was an exchange student there) may contribute to this more than anything else.  Unfortunately, I can't get my friends fired up about it though they all seem to enjoy it.

I am not a big fan of auction or area control games. But the blend of the two works well for me.  I like the added suspense of trying to screw everyone through the action cards while trying to efficiently balance my moves from the provinces to my court and from my court to the regions.  I also like the added suspense of the Castillo emptying during the scoring round and the "clearly I cannot choose the cup in front of me" reasoning when selecting their destination.

I have the decennial version but haven't gotten into the expansions yet.

A masterpiece meshing of several tensions. The tension to play a high value card for early action card choice vs the need to play caballeros to your court.  The tension to choose more manipulative actions vs actions that allow you to place more caballeros onto the board.  The tension to place your caballeros into the Castillo vs dispensed throughout the board. 

This game is very engaging throughout, whether its your turn or not. It well deserves its place among the all-time Top 5.

This game has stood the test of time quite well. Plenty of neighbour abuse and tactics in this one, and the castillo adds a dash of surprise to each scoring round as well. Must be said that the theme is a 100% paste job, but it doesn't take away from the experience for me. Unlike most people I actually prefer this at the 4 scale instead of 5, with more players I think the game just gets a tad too chaotic, it's still quality at either scale, but 4 is the sweet spot on this one for me. The action cards can get a bit samey with replays, and the game feels a bit basic these days, but it is still the modern progenitor of the AIG school and I have to respect it for that. 

I do have to say that the King & Intrigue expansion has really spoiled me at this point though, and the original game doesn't have as much appeal. The problem for me is that K&I can only be played with 5, and I rarely have a group of 5 experienced players who are interested in it. I actually have ended up getting rid of my copy of Grande for that reason, as the vanilla version, while still better than most of the AIG that have come down the pike, is not the one that I would be pulling off my personal shelf at this point at anything but the 5 scale, and I have a slew of other good options for lower scales which can play fine with 5 as well. 

Playing K&I also makes me more annoyed with the excessively tactical nature of the vanilla Grande action cards. It's gotten to the point now where I've turned down vanilla Grande on a number of occasions because it just doesn't have nearly as much appeal as it used to. I find myself much preferring the more layered AIG that have come out since this such as Liberte, Im Schatten des Kaisers, Struggle of Empires, and so forth. K&I Grande is one of the best in the genre, the basic version? A little pedestrian for my present tastes.

An amazing game.  Rich with complexity and strategy.  Interesting with great game play - you can work together to fight the leader, but it isn't easy.  There is some randomness, but the effect is shared by all players.  There is a touch of semi-hidden information, but it is something you can plan around.  Every time I play I am won over anew.

Likes: An area control game where everyone starts with the same hand of cards to use for the game. The castle hiding the caballeros and the king making a region taboo really make the game what it is.

One of the best [u]area control[/u] games: tense, tough decisions, lots of player interaction, huge replay value, low randomness. It's a very tactical game with a minimal downtime, because you must permanently watching and counting and the player turns are quick.
I'm not 'very happy' with the the German cards (I wrote an English translation on the cards) until we learn the iconography on the cards. Also, the English expansion replaces all the German cards.
[i]House rules: we like to play the "Open Castillo" variant (with the Castillo cubes always revealed). Also, the 2-player variant where each person controls 2 colors and adding the two scores together at the end.[/i]

this very good game got surprisingly little table time for me. It has a good amount of player interaction but it is difficult to have strategy, relying largely on decisions that need to be made turn by turn based on the ever changing circumstances.

This game is a great mix of strategy and planning with chaos and uncertainty. 5-player is good due to the accommodation of a fifth player and the certainty that someone is going to get stuck with a crappy action card. However, I might enjoy 4-player slightly more since it allows the last player to choose an action card to pick the lesser of two evils and all players have to deal with the uncertainty about which action card will not be selected. I do not think that I would ever play El Grande with fewer then four and have still not used any of the expansions.

This is a good game with many things to consider. Have not played in a while but seem to remember that being opportunistic was not always a good thing.

Rating goes down to 9 if you don't have at least 4 players. The beauty is in forcing people to get crappy cards if they wimp out and bid low, just to get more caballeros. It should take real work and strategy to get all of your caballeros on the board by game end. Love it.

I found the expansions completely unnecessary.

RATING: 5
El Grande is a sin of my youth. Everyone was raving about it, so I had to get it myself, right? The game is, at its heart, a majority game, and one of the first ones to do this in a big box format. It can be called the granddaddy of majority games, and although many variations have been worked out, they can all trace at least some roots back to this dinosaur. In that regard it was a major step in the evolution of modern game design, so some familiarity with it is almost a necessity if you take this hobby at all serious.

In El Grande, players try to score points for having a numerical majority of cubes in certain areas. The source of those cubes comes from a deck of cards which tie two things together: the amount of cubes you can take out of a public pool and place into your private pool, but also the order in which players can select an action card from a pool. That action card tells the players what they are allowed to do in that round. If you want a shot at being the first player, you must play a high-numbered card will likely not allow you to move many cubes to your private pool; if you don't care then a low card will give you plenty of movement options later. Play three times 3 rounds, interspersed with scoring (which can see some last minute changes on the board), tally the score and determine the victor.

The trouble with this game is that people get their terminology terribly mixed up. Many will call this game 'strategic', but it's nearly all tactics as the action cards change every round (with one exception). The strategy is in managing your pool of cubes, and that is heavily influenced by what you want to achieve in the short term on the board. They also call it 'luckless', which is a big lie too as, once again, the action cards change every round. You can memorise the types of card in each deck so you will get a better idea of what is in there, but you'll always assume that your opponents do this too plus that it is not a given [i]when[/i] the card shows up (if at all). But worst of all, they [i]don't[/i] call this game 'the epitome of multiplayer chaos' (although Maharadja is arguably worse in this respect). Player order is very important because it determines what you can still do on the board. With just 9 rounds of actual play, things need to be efficient. And that's just it: they aren't. You can be easily outclassed by another player, putting your somewhere between place 2 and 5 in the player order. Once it is your turn, you must select a card from what is left, and that might not at all be what caused you to play a high(er) card anyway. In other words, players continuously get in each other's way [i]in unexpected ways[/i], which I find frustrating and annoying. I do not want to play a game where it all comes down to gut feeling and having a few lucky streaks. Because of the nigh impossibility to do any actual steering unless you are lucky enough to have the highest card all the time, people adopt a score-for-the-moment attitude. I don't like this very much.

Phrased another way, the core issue is that I don't feel in control in sufficient amounts for the time I need to think, as well as the game takes to play.  Many majority successors solve this issue quite satisfyingly, either by making the amount of influence to be placed much more a separate fact rahter than something tied in with player order, or by giving each player a more or less guaranteed shot at the actions he can perform. That way, players can select [i]their[/i] amount of influence or actions, and win or lose because of them.

I wish I could rate El Grande higher than the '4' it's getting, but there are other games I'd much rather put in front of multiple players if I feel inclined in a little majority messing. Mykerinos is shorter and intenser; Louis XIV gives rock'n'roll if you want it; San Marco provides zany chaos with its distinctive divide-and-chose mechanism; Liberté is a hoot with 5; King of Siam an intense brain burner; Web of Power is perfect for 3; Aton (as well as a few others) is perfect for 2. None of these games suffer from loss of player control; hence they all rank higher with me. 

After the first few games, I sold off this tile, and have never felt the need to look back upon that decision.

[b]Update[/b] It's always fun to look back on games which you last played several years ago. I played with 3, and like the game better at this number because it's easier to estimate what people will take... But it remains quite a chaotic and ad hoc game; and the fact that a significant amount of players thinks this game best at the high end of the player range tells me that El Grande is simply not my cup of tea. Still, I decided to up the rating a little to account for this effect.

[u]3 PLAYERS[/u]: 5
[u]4 PLAYERS[/u]: 4 (chaos is increasing)
[u]5 PLAYERS[/u]: I'd rather read a book, to be honest.

Feb 2008 - Taught by the master Gary who runs JBGS in Waukesha.  Gary has the most recorded plays of this game on the Geek so it was fun to play with someone who really enjoys this.

For my couple plays of this, I enjoy it thoroughly and consider it one of the (if not thee) best area control games.  Will happily play this anytime.

I'll start my rating off at 9 knowing that I would play it right now if given the opportunity.

Definitly one of my favorite games of all time. I have used it to introduce new German game players to the hobby. I think it's easy enough to explain to qualify as gateway game. Many would disagree though.

RATING: 9
They say this is the Grand(e) Daddy of Area control and I
tend to agree. This game really put area control on the
map as far as I`m concerned. My first game left me longing for more spanish conquests. Like a matador I 
concealed my sword (cabelleros in the castillo) and waited for the crucial moment when the other bulls would fall prey to my razor sharp plan. Ole!!

RATING: 5
Abstract game with a pseudo-historical
packaging.

As often, it makes a poor multiplayer games.

Lot of luck involved and as usual, victory often decided by kingmaking but I have to admit it can be fun to play from time to time (once a year, perhaps).

Overated.

RATING: 8
Neat euro style board game.  This game is a constant struggle to have the most or second most caballeros in each of the Spanish provinces on the board.  Game mechanics flow well and there is relatively no down time.  This is a good solid game that players nominate for play every now and then even though it is an old game relative to so many newer euro style games.  El Grande plays in 60 - 90 minutes and is fun to play.  El Grande has made my list of top 50 euro style games of all time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
This is an area majority game in its purest form - have the most caballeros (knights) in a region and score the most points there in one of three scoring rounds.  But it's not so simple - getting your caballeros onto the board and moving them around requires picking the right action cards at the right time.

Timing is determined by playing a "power card" to determine turn order for the round.  Each player selects an available action card and plays it.  Complicating matters is the king - wherever he is, you can't play, but you must enter the board on adjacent provinces.

The very cool twist is the castillo (castle) - there are majority bonuses in this hidden chamber as well.  But before it's scored, players secretly select a region to send their caballeros to after scoring.  That mixes things up when regions are scored!

For a relatively simple game, there's a lot to think about.  Generally I just found it to be fun - something that gets lost in games sometimes.  Definitely looking forward to future plays of this older classic.

I really like El Grande, but it is definitely the hardest to get to the table with my family.  One of the few my wife actively prefers not to play.  Maybe the confrontation doesn't suit her?

RATING: 4
The rating of 4 is for the official game with large amounts of important hidden trackable information (HTI) - see my 2nd general thought on games in my profile for my stance on HTI. I'd rate the version on Yucata.de considerably better (with a 5.5), because it shows you the action cards and power cards left in the stacks and the number of Caballeros in the Castillo.

El Grande has a very solid game design. At first, I like this game a lot. But the more I was exposed to other game, the less I want to play it. Main reason is its abstract and dull theme. Gameplay kinda repetitive. But I do know that this game is good brain burning game. And it's a nasty game, since people need to directly confront each other.

Grandfather of area control games and for me the best of them. Very simple although deep. 9 for basic game, 10 for Konig & Intrigant.

RATING: 8
Components: Sturdy components (especially the Castillo). I would prefer that the non-territory spaces (i.e. water, France, and Portugal) were set off from the board proper with a different color, despite breaking from the imitation of an old map.

Experience: Play is interesting, trying to achieve/maintain control in several territories in time to be scored. The actions cards take a bit to get used to, but if players just take a moment to read through what is available for the round, all goes well.

Although I don't often win this game, I enjoy the game play a lot. Best with more people than fewer only because you get in each other's way a lot. Like to see those big piles of cubes on the board and trying to stretch your resources to nip a few key districts. Strategic play of the king placement, cards and castle all play into a win. The last three rounds see a lot of counting and movement of resources to optimize your score. Great game.

My group has finally found a level of comfort within this game.  Everyone knows what they are doing, and that has really opened up the game.  It is a simple and elegant area control game that has lots of confrontation and tense moments--mostly centering around the castillo.

The daddy of all area control games.  I think it might be a little too chaotic with five, but I played with three and fell in love with it.  The castille really makes the game; having that hidden scoring and last-minute chance to affect the board really brings a lot of tension to the game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Still a favorite, although it may be showing its age. One of the original area majority games. The main fun is in the choice of which card to take each turn and how best to utilize it. Cards change value to different players and at different parts of the game, so one that may be of little value to you may be vital to another. Do you take it to deny it to him? Or take your best play to maximize your own score?  There's lots of room for general nastiness, which I enjoy.

I own the Big Box version.

After reading the rules and prior to playing, I was less enthused to get this to the table.  To my surprise, when I finally did get to try it, I really enjoyed it.  It's very balanced and yet quite deep.  Lots of ways to affect the other players, but not so much that it's frustrating.

Definitely a game that can be played over and over many times.  The Castillo (castle) mechanic is just brilliant.
This game is one of the top games and well-deserving of it, but it could really use a make-over (board and cards).

I find it equally fun with 4 or 5 players, even though most gamers only want to play it with 5. Still an awesome game with five too.

I have discovered this classic game by chance while playing with some friends without knowing it was such classic game.

I quite like the different mechanics that come into play. 

I got the feeling that the game tends to make you play thinking in the short-term without giving the possibility of building a long term plan.

The fact that each player's round can change the game situation a lot might lead to analysis paralysis because all your strategy might be impacted by what the other players are doing.

+ De spelers plaatsen hun Grande en 2 cabballero’s in de regio en 1 cabballero op het scorespoor.
+ 7 cabballero’s liggen in het hof, de overige cabballero’s liggen in de provincie.
+ De actiekaarten komen naast het speelbord te liggen.

Speelverloop:

Er zijn 9 rondes. Elke ronde bestaat uit de volgende stappen:

1/ De zwarte rondenteller schuift 1 vakje naar beneden. Aan het einde van de 3e, 6e en 9e ronde vindt er een algemene puntentelling plaats.

2/ De 5 actiekaarten worden omgedraaid.

3/ De spelers spelen hun machtkaarten uit.

In de eerste ronde mag de jongste speler als eerste een machtkaart uitspelen. Vanaf de tweede ronde begint altijd de speler die in de voorgaande ronde als laatste aan de beurt was. De overige spelers volgen in de richting van de klok. Alle uitgespeelde machtkaarten moeten een verschillende waarde hebben. De speler die de hoogste machtkaart heeft gespeeld, begint met het kiezen van een actiekaart. Daarna de speler met de op één na hoogste machtkaart, enz. Afhankelijk van de gespeelde machtkaart verplaatst de speler cabballero’s van zijn provincie naar zijn hof. 

4/ De machtkaart gaat naar de aflegstapel.

5/ De speler neemt één van de openliggende actiekaarten.

6/ De speler voert de actie uit en plaatst het aantal cabballero’s (afhankelijk van de gekozen actiekaart) op het speelbord. Je mag kiezen of je eerst cabballero’s plaatst of eerst de actie uitvoert. Cabballero’s mogen naar believen geplaatst worden in regio’s naast de koningsregio en/of in El Castillo.

7/ De gekozen actiekaart gaat naar de aflegstapel.

Na ronde 3, 6 en 9 volgt een algemene puntentelling:

1. Draaischijf instellen.
2. Telling van El Castillo.
3. Cabballero’s uit El Castillo  in de (op het draaischijf gekozen) regio plaatsen.
4. Telling van alle regio’s.

Waardetabel:

Bij 2 spelers: 1e cijfer
Bij 3 spelers: de 2 eerste cijfers
Bij 4 of 5 spelers: de 3 cijfers

In geval van een gelijke stand in een regio, ontvangen de spelers steeds de punten van de lagere lang. In geval van gelijke stand in de koningsregio krijgt niemand de koningsbonus.

Belangrijke regels:

+ Er worden alleen maar cabballero’s geplaatst in aangrenzende regio’s van de koningsregio (uitzondering: cabballero’s die in het geheim vanuit El Castillo op het speelbord worden geplaatst).
+ Er worden nooit cabballero’s geplaatst in de koningsregio (ook niet vanuit El Castillo).
+ Cabballero’s kunnen vanuit El Castillo slechts in 1 regio worden geplaatst.
+ De meerderheid halen in de koningsregio = +2 bonuspunten.
+ De meerderheid halen in de thuisregio (bij een Grande) = +2 bonspunten.
+ Als je provincie leeg is, mag je cabballero’s van het speelbord halen.

Good game, high replayability. I don't rate it higher than 7 because I am more in favor of games like AGoT and Age of Renaissance. The good being that there are tuff choices to be made, the bad being that it takes only one person sleeping at the table to create a runaway leader.

El Grande is a classic area control game and it is that element of the game that I feel is the strongest. I do feel, though, that some of the action cards may be imbalanced in the basic game (I know...blasphemy). The King is so powerful; it allows the player to place five caballeros from their court, it potentially keeps other players from adding caballeros to regions where they are needed, and the player controlling the King can score an extra two points from having it in their own region (and other players cannot place caballeros in that region...because the King is there!). Other cards like "score all six and seven regions" are very powerful, as well. Personally, I don't like the need to remember the number of caballeros each player has in the Castillo, but I do like the chaos when the cabelleros are placed into new regions, from the Castillo. Good, solid production value in the Hans im Gluch version. Great decision-making. This game bounces back and forth between a 9 and a 10 for me.

Fairly simple to explain this game, but it has tremendous depth. Also seems to strike an almost perfect balance between keeping everyone in the race, but not too easy to "bash the leader". Good tough decisions too without the tight specifications that can cause analysis paralysis. We always seem to have a lot of friendy table banter when playing this one.

With so much to think about (bidding cards, action cards, your opponents' board positions, etc.) and so many opportunities to be nasty, the game has not yet become fun.

The granddaddy of area control, and somewhat showing its age.  There is a little too much luck involved with all the cards, and the castillo seems like an afterthought that brings nothing much to the game but some chaos and hidden trackable information, but overall it's still an interesting game.  Play it with at least four players and preferably with the King and Intrigue expansion to be able to have more control.

El Grande seemed to be another game that was rather interesting. Unfortunately no one I knew seemed to own it, so I went ahead and purchased it. 

I liked and like the game quite a bit. Unfortunately it never caught hold of the people around me. Most of the individuals in my weekend game group of the time though it was less interesting then Shogun (My girlfriend: "Why play El Grande when we could play Shogun instead?") and pushed back against the idea of playing it. At the Wednesday game shop no one really seemed to like it that much. They thought it was fine but nothing special.

As for myself, I thought it was a really solid, really elegant example of the Area Control genre. A basic distillation of the theme without a lot of the bells and whistles added by later area control games. I also learned that why I was hesitant about pure auction games, I did like pure area control games.

The grand-daddy of majority/scoring games. Over nine turns, players manipulate their control blocks of wood on the board, to try and make them score as many of the regions as possible. Getting them to the board is a three step process, and once on the board they can be moved and removed by events. Lots to think about and certainly rewarding when you win, but boiled down you are never far removed from moving coloured cubes around a board. Several expansions are available.

Played this for the first time the other day with three. Very much looking forward to playing it again. It's relatively simple area control game, where by a flop of changing cards provide special abilities that enable to board to change in a constantly shifting manner. Turn order is dictated by played power cards that are generic and one use only - your 13 card will let you go first but then you never have that card again, that sort of thing.  Dropping the cubes (I believe they are meeples in the newest edition) into the tower - or castillo if you are into that - is really fun, as is revealing what is in there when the time comes. The tower is perhaps my favourite component in any game. I like the perhaps now dated map. The power cards aren't the prettiest, but like everything in the game are quite functional.

I have only played this with three, I imagine it scales excellently up to the maximum player count.

Playtime was just over an hour, which felt perfect.

Overall, I really enjoyed this game, it would appeal to strategy gamers as there is depth, but not a huge amount of complexity. You could play breezily and have this as  a sort of gateway plus. 

UPDATE: Played again with five, game scaled really well, though plays a little differently as if you go last you have no choice of which card to take.

A provisional 9.

Addendum: a few more plays in, this is not the most fun game in my collection, but it hints at being the best, the most solid, reliable and well behaved. Three, four and five are all wonderful counts.  No rule is fiddly. No component is extraneous. No time is wasted. The aged design of the original game board is weirdly charming. I love that it's set in Spain for a reason I can't articulate.

Picked this up at a yard sale unpunched. The lady wanted 2 Euros for it, I gave her five and still felt like I mugged her (which is probably because I did mug her).

El Grande seems like the most elegant game we have... all of the decisions balance multiple objectives, and the board position is just stable enough to allow for clever but forgiving strategy and tactics.

Idea:
Play your units on the map of Spain and fight over control of the regions. One region is the tower where you cant see how many units are in if you dont remember and before scoring each player decides secretly to which area those men go to reinforce.

Mechanism:
Each round there are five different actions that give either more men to get to reserves or stronger action (move men/remove men etc). One action is always same but other four are drawn randomly from respective deck. Amount of men to place from reserves are decided on 1-13 numbered turn orders. The earlier you act (and pick your action) the less you get men from reserves to play. Also numbers are used so once you use 1 or 13 someone can act first/last if they wish. On scoring 'larger' regions give points to multiple players (and more too) thus they tend to be fought over while smaller regions can be controlled with fewer men.

to who:
Really good game for those who like region control games. I also like that there is no combat between men, just over cards which manipulate amount of men.

The Iberian Peninsula is depicted on a hard mapboard divided into 9 large areas. Impressive at first glance. The rules are easy and straightforward. A game for 2 to 5 players where each player attempts to have majority in each area of Spain and score points. So far so good. The whole mechanics focus around adding cubes to areas trying to have the majority of your color. After a play the game leaves you a dry taste: there is no thrill, no major player interaction, no planning since all strategy is altered by others’ players actions, repetitive – almost boring. After a couple of turns  the players who have been left behind in score results, will most certainly be left in the final place at game end without even the chance or hope to alter their destiny! The player with the most points at game end is the winner; not even the winner feels that he has accomplished something in this game.  The game lacks something for sure; no fun, no interest, no expectation! The theme and concept is intriguing but after actual play one can understand that the map could have portrayed any territory similar to that of a continent or that of a tiny island in the Pacific; The system lacks any incentive for the players,- just adding cubes populating areas and then score. I prefer investing time into games that produce fun, tense moments and excitement!

At first glance this game looks a little dated. Dull and boring. The map of spain has very little appeal and all the colourful wooden cubes get you this very oldschool euro-game feeling.
This is a shame, because the game itself is amazing and full of tension and fighting. I might even prefer it to Chaos in the Old World, despite the boring theme, just because this is more slim and more straight forward. Epic boardgame design.

Decennial Edition - Included expansions:
[thing=370][/thing] (aka. Intrigue & The King)
[thing=3146][/thing] (aka. Grand Inquisitor & The Colonies)
[thing=597][/thing]

Each time this game is played, it receives relatively warm reviews.  Quite an engaging game.  This is one of the few games that actually obeys its duration: 90 min. for 4 players, 2hrs. for 5-players.  Has become a victim of the 'Cult of the New', however it's played on occasion.  The last time I played was a 2-player game.  What we did was randomly block off 2 regions to reduce the map size so competition would be more prevalent - which worked well.  The game lasted less than 45 min.

I was convinced that the map expansions for adding Portugal & France lend itself to a 6-player variant.  I created player pieces for a 6th player and have tried it!  It works well with 6 players, and adds about a ½ hour to the duration.

The English title is "The Grande".   Classic area control game whose influence is felt strongly in Mission Red Planet, Rattus, Dominant Species and a host of other games.  Those games might have a thematic edge, but this one might have the edge in terms of simplicity and "pureness" in the design, if it isn't too highbrow and sycophantic to say that.  I do see where leader bashing and some of the chaos in the action cards could be an issue for some, but I don't feel like it is a problem the way it is implemented here.   Seems like a game that just needs to be part of the collection.

This game is fantastic. The more players involved, the better it is, but it's still decent with 2 players if you play the variant where each player controls two grandes. There are alot of complaints about the theme, but I'm engaged with every play. My favorite aspect of the game is using the secrecy disks for placing or moving caballeros. Trying to anticipate your opponent's selection is too gripping because of the sometimes devastating consequences of choosing poorly. An excellent game and highly recommended.

RATING: 7
I first played this game in 2015 and it never felt like a game from almost 20 years ago.  It’s a very good game that has held up very well, and its easy to see how the mechanics introduced in this game have been replicated and copied into many games since.   

I especially like the option of players collectively hiding cubes in the tower and then having a secret simultaneous reveal to see where they go.  That is the best part of the game.  The part of the game I don’t like are the various special action cards that I feel add too much randomness and make the game a little chaotic.  I feel that if the game was introduced today, they would be standardized into only five customary repeating actions (in much the way as the ‘move the king’ card is) with easy to understand iconography.  As it is, the game seems to stop when they are revealed as everyone seems to freeze while reading them and figuring out what to do next (this slows down the momentum of the game).   

Any game where I have a lack of control over the outcome of my actions and becomes too chaotic makes me loose interest, and that’s how I start to feel halfway through the game.  I rarely saw the same ‘action card’ reveled throughout the entire game.  With nine rounds and four ‘wild’ special action cards reviled during the game (that rarely repeat themselves), that’s about 36 possible chaotic actions that come into play during a five player game.  I feel that if they only had the same five actions (such as the ‘move the scoring marker’ and the ‘veto’ action cards), the game would be a bit more strategic and we could focus several moves in advance.  As it I, the game is just a bit too unpredictable but still a solid area-control game.

This is in my top 5 games of all time. El Grande is the prize game for both exp players and new players to Strategy Games.

It is one of the rare games that is almost luck free, focusing solely on placement of the king, your pawns, and the cards you choose. Even the card selection (while semi-random) take thought since you will use ot for power and position. The bidding adds the final piece since you bid to determine turn orderm, but the higher you bid, the less units you get, so every aspect of your turn has both pro and con consequences which I love about this game.

I love this game, and originally rated it a 10.  Unfortunately, its rather large Kingmaker factor forced me to lower its rating a couple of notches.  When someone falls way behind in El Grande, there's nothing for him to do but hand the game to somebody else.  Players have to work VERY HARD to keep the score balance in El Grande, not only beating up on the leader but generously helping anyone who falls too far behind.  If they don't, that guy way in the back of the pack is forced to be somebody's heel.

Otherwise, El Grande rocks!

I first tried this a few years ago, and have been able to play several times since.  I think it deserves its reputation as one of the first & best area majority games.
You've got some good tension going with the bidding of cards for turn order and piece activation, and lots of interesting choices about where to deploy.  The Castillo and paradropping from it during scoring mean more tense decisions.  The restrictions about placing next to, but not in, the king's region also are a nice touch.  These limitations, as well as the action cards, mean that no majority is ever perfectly safe.  You have to watch out for the other players trying to snipe your majorities during scoring, as well as disrupting your plans by card play.  
All in all, a real classic game.
If I have one complaint, its that the mid-value regions seem oddly more valuable than the high-value ones.  This is because the mid-value ones are less likely to be heavily contested, and because there are cards in the deck that cause those regions to score during the round.  Focusing on them seems to be a winning strategy, from what I've seen.

Only 3 plays but I'm in love with it.  Map area control, hand management, action/card selection, just plain awesome. Always trying to get this to grab with family/friends.  If they could just re-release with a less drab art style or different thematic setting.  Hoping to groom my kids to play with me some day.

This game is amazing - I may not want to play this all the time, but when you do play - man - I've never been so engrossed by another players turn. Every decision has consequences, and there are no real bad cards out there. Its just a question between choosing between a good move, and the best move. Any game where I am as interested in what my opponents do as my own turn is a 10 in my book!

●It's a classic area control game and has been released since 1995. Now, a game that can last that long is something special, and that's what made me want to get it.

● Comment Update1: Played the game for the first time. This is a very good area control game. Now that I've played the game, I understand why the game were given so much praises about. A classic that will stand the test of time.

Clasico por derecho, un euro de antaño, reglas sencillas, pero con desiciones muy interesante, lo unico que no me gusta es el tema de que se juegue por tunos y basicamente cada era es similar a la anterior por lo cual se pueden cortar, de hecho se hacen y por ende no hay sensacion de narracion ni avance en la partida, la duracion es algo excesiva y no escala bien, pero las mecanicas tan bien engrasadas, tan genialmente pensadas, trabajo de un artesano de los eurogames hacen que el juego de todas formas sea un disfrute.

Great tactical abstract game— maximise your score on a turn and you cant look too far ahead, due to the chaos.  The Castillo makes things even more interesting.  It is a min-maxing points game, and has a bit of analysis-- there are a lot of things to keep track of, such as what other cards will be picked/played this turn, what's in the castillo, what could happen next turn, etc. You spend a lot of time looking at different provinces, seeing what gain you will get in points if you drop cubes there.  In some ways, there are too many options for a multiplayer game, and if you get in the mode of points analysis and optimization (which is easy to fall into), the game is not as good.  The 9-turn game can be too long (in my group).

Wow, I am generally apprehensive about 90s games simply because so many advances have been made since then (although I'm not a snob - some of my favorite games are indeed from that era), but this was nowhere near as dry as I thought it might be.  In fact, if dry is the operative word for sleep-inducing optimization exercises, then the applicable words here are slippery, moist, lubricated gameplay (which is a little fitting given what the king piece looks like... for real, what is the deal with that thing?).

First off, you have a Euro that has all of the traditional trappings of the standard-bearers, but instead of a 5-player solitaire, you get a very engaging and interactive game that doesn't even really involve much cube pushing (while that sounds like an admonishment against all euros, it's more the broad brushstroke of my experiences with more recent 'heavy' ones).  Let's tick off the inventory - VP track around the board? Check. Little wooden cubes everywhere? Check. Multiple scoring rounds that stop normal gameplay? Check. Pointless theme? Check. Weird dudes on the cover? Check-a-roo! Pointlessly-gigantic phallic symbol roaming around the map in a threatening manner? Che... okay, that's not standard, but it's worth a mention.  Seriously... what is the deal with that thing?

So it's not without reason that you can expect a decent brain burner and VP race in the vein of like, anything else out there, but instead there's a few things that set this one apart and make it terrific fun.  It plays fast, for one and it's highly interactive, for two.  Among its more unique features are the Castillo, a tall wooden(?) tower that sits on the board for people to deposit cubes (called caballeros in the game, and while I am aware of its actual meaning, I still can't help but think of Disney's Three Caballeros every time) whose contents are hidden (though declared) and revealed for scoring in later rounds; unless you have a ridiculously good memory, you never quite know how that bit of scoring is going to play out.  Next are the area-selection discs (disks?) that allow for secrecy in a few opportunities that arise in which to place your cubes - thus, this is not a perfect-information game, which I love - and it creates a great little tense moment when you're trying to gamble on someone else's choice.  Then there are the action-selection cards and power cards; while not the first, and most certainly not the last game to feature action-selection and turn-order bidding (with the power cards), what's key here is that the actions available to choose from are almost always going to cause someone else at the table some pain and your choices amount to bid high and get that card to spare yourself, or bid low and risk being a target in order to get more cubes into your supply.  Then, of course, each action card that you choose also determines how many cubes you get to place on the board and the big ol' dildo of a king determines where.

On the surface, it sounds complicated, but the game has this beautifully-elegant flow to it and like I said, it plays fast for what it is.  At no point did I find the game overstayed its welcome and in fact, I found it to be over too soon.  Although the scoring can be a bit swingy, it's all about managing not just what you can do, but also what the other players cannot do.

Amazing game.  Wish I had played it sooner.

The last couple of games I played of El Grande was with someone else copy. My copy was played once so far, and I wasn't one of the players playing at that time! 

The more I play this game, the more I enjoy playing it. With more plays, the game is growing more and more on me. I am glad to have the chance to try this one out. I have heard many things on this game without playing it once even though it has been about 10 the game has been out already.


Played it at the Concordia group at some point. I finished last but enjoyed the game nevertheless. Everybody went around the board once where scoring is concerned. So every player had a final score of 100+ pts.

Played another game, this time with 3 players. It was a extremely close finish. We were all on the edge of our seat during the game. Drama and suspense the whole game!


8 plays since recording games played.


Traded the french edition of El Grande and got myself the Decennial edition in another trade. Got my hands on another El Grande and trade it for Tikal.

the classic ultimate of area control .. so, yes, it is cubes .. and cubes do get shuffled around and about ... but I really really enjoy this one ! ... build your forces in the differing regions in Spain, and there are wonderful opportunites to obstruct your rivals (what is a board game, after all, without conflict) .. yes, one spends time building up, only for another to tear down, obstruct and madden ... but then, you have to find your way around and through the obstacles thrown into your path ... shall one go first, or last ?? .. what power card is best .. how many cubes shall I deposit into the Castillo ??? ... all these questions, for me, make this a wonderful strategic, tactical battle, and engages the mind against your rivals ... best with five, and acceptable with four ... this is my classic favourite

An excellent strategy game that provides a player with many tough choices. Gaining and maintaining influence over each province is key; but watch the Castile! A great multi player game.

This is one fantastic area control/bidding game with a lot of interesting mechanisms going on, such as your deck of initiative cards for bidding on selection of the various actions in the 5 stacks, the effects of the 5 stacks themselves, and chaotic castillo unit placement.  I also enjoy the King in that nothing can move into or out of his area, the bonus points he provides and that you can only place caballeros in areas adjacent to The King.  My only complaint towards the game is that it can be a bit boring while waiting for people to decide what they're doing, however, this makes the scoring rounds all the more exciting.

I seem to have problems with games where other players' choices alter the field and disrupt my plans in the middle of things...

I think I may be starting to get the hang of this game. Finally won a game (quite decisively!), and my previous game I should have won except for a foolish error in selecting my secret region for the final scoring. Great game!

One of those few games where everything comes together to create a fantastic game experience. Area-control at its best. There's strategic planning, where players have to figure out the best way to get their caballeros from the provinces to the court to the regions (and which regions!). There's a psychological element of guessing when it comes to deciding what power cards to play. And there's the action cards, which have very interesting powers to spice up the game and also give the game a stronger theme than you'd think a Eurogame would have. The game is such that a player's strategy must be comprehensive. Neglect one aspect of the game and he will lose the game. Very challenging stuff.

I can foresee myself playing this game for a really long time, and with the expansions, beyond that even. A top effort by Kramer and Ulrich.

[3 plays] I really would like to play this more, at least enough to figure out what I really think of it.  I was very favorably impressed by it the first time; I liked the fact that I could play this for the first time and both have fun and be competitive in the game (yet without anywhere near feeling like I had exhausted what it had to offer).  In other words, NOT one of those games where you must totally understand how to play before starting so that you can concoct the grand strategy without which you are doomed.  However, in subsequent plays I felt increasingly at a disadvantage because I was less familiar with the cards.  I think this is one of the many games where it really helps you to know what's in the deck and what the distribution is.

One of the best area-majority game I've ever played. High replay-ability and very-very cutthroat. However, the nice part is even if you are lagged behind on the beginning of the game, you still can catch up later on if you can pick the right choices.

I don't see this game as elegant at all.  Perhaps my definition is different than others, but any game with as many little bits as this can't be elegant.  Power cards, action cards, spinners, two places for pieces, etc.  Not elegant, but incredibly balanced and amazingly rich.

One of the joys of playing this was being able to go back and read rorschah's comments about it and understand what he was talking about.  Just as he says, the beauty of the game is the way that early decisions linger - you're making new moves, but you never quite escape from the early positions you stake.  This makes the beginning and mid game as exciting as the finish.

Even better is that I found the workings to be delightfully transparent.  I won by one point, and I was immediately able to recall a large number of tense moments in the game of which any had gone differently could have knocked me back in the pack.  Good all the way through and fun to think about afterwards.  I love area control, and this is the best I've played.

My first Euro and perhaps my favourite Euro. A horde of beautiful little coloured wooden blocks makes for a visually attractive game, always a bonus in my experience. El Grande is a very clean game - gameplay is tight and transparent. The castillo mechanic is a superb aspect, delivering some guaranteed moments of suspense three times a game. El Grande is a game devoid of strategy but rich in tactical possibilities every turn. It's the consummate opportunist's dream game. It's not unusual for newcomers to win, as the rules are very easy to understand and experienced players don't receive any strategic-understanding dividend - the game is decided by bidding, card selection and area influence decisions.

Every single time I play this game I tell myself I need to play it more often.  It is a "take that" game to some extent, a genre I don't tend to enjoy, but there enough constraints placed on player choices that the "take that" aspect doesn't overwhelm the game.  It has exactly the right amount of player interaction for me.

It is a game that requires thoughtful, engaged players in order to shine.  It can be dull if people play flawlessly.

Uma idéia muito boa enfraquecida pela interação extremamente exagerada. No final das contas, vc n tem controle de quase nada.

Lots of people here on BGG have told me - you like area control? You simply must try El Grande. And I finally did. And it was great. I still prefer dudes on a map + area control to this area majority but I really really enjoyed the play and would love to play again. The look of the game really shows its age, though (why on Earth didn't they put numbers on the score track?). It would be nice to have a reprint. I would deffinitely buy it.

RATING: 9
Based on 4 plays.
+ A good abstract game.
+ For some unknown reason, this game feels a lot better game than Caylus.
- The scoring track seems to be short of numbers, but it isn't. I scored nearly 110 points in my first game and it was unnecessarily difficult to use the scoring track...not to mention my latest game with 128 points.
- The distant (or ridiculous?) theme is not helping to understand the rules.
- New decennial edition has severe printing erros. They have fixed it already, but it was a catastrophy.
- I'm not a big fan of abstract victory point games. I do usually well, though.

Updated 8->9 in 2011 after 4 plays. This is the best area control game -- I don't see how this game could be improved.

(2-5 players) This is about as good as boardgaming gets. Great components, lots of levers/choices, interaction, and good, simple mechanics.

Downgraded from 10 to 9:
The few times I've played this game I always try to turtle a bit at the beginning and hope that I can use reserve power at middle and/or end. The game doesn't really allow for that; it rewards "balls to the wall" play from the very beginning and it can be difficult to make up lost ground when everyone else plays that way. For that reason I have dinged it one point. A better game would allow more freedom in play style between players. In this one it is kill or be killed.

RATING: 7
My first play in about a decade. I didn't like El Grande the first time out, and in my mind it seemed very complex. That's probably because I played with the german cards and write ups, so it was difficult for me a s a newcomer. This time, I found it very easy and the decisions for me were simple, my timing was better and I actually squeeked out a win in the end. But it took 3 HOURS!!! Talk about Analysis Paralysis. Go on, talk about analysis paralysis for three hours. I'm much more inclined to play my copy at home now, but this is not a game to play with strangers or new players. I've put it at 7, which may go up or down on the next plays.

The "grandfather" of the area majority system - which remains one of the most prevelant game mechanics today.  The Castillo tower is a highlight that brings a nice memory twist.  El Grande still offers a deep and engrossing experience, and not to be missed.  This gem is a classic!  I have only slightly downgraded the score recently due to more impressive designs in recent years.  Grade: A-

I have a family of five, and El Grande is a fantastic five-player game.  The game's mechanics are simple enough that my seven-year-old twins can play (and even win!), but there is still enough depth in this one to engage gamers.  Love the look of the map and board on this one too.  The deciennial edition also throws in all of the expansions, which is a nice bonus.  Hope to play this one much more with my family.

This game quickly catapulted itself to the top of my favorite game list, with its easy to learn rules, but seemingly incredible amount of depth and the general atmosphere of deceit and outsmarting one's opponents.  As a relatively basic area control game (with a beautiful map and overall presentation), El Grande encourages constant shifting of plans, and no one way to victory seems overpowered or assured, and those who stick to a similar strategy turn after turn, or even game after game, seem to be easily outmaneuvered or defeated time and time again.  There is a enough tricky and manipulative ways to play to keep the game engaging in a jerk sort of way, without making it mean spirited, so rarely will someone leave the game feeling like they were singled out or unfairly defeated.

As part of the current 10th anniversary edition of the game, it comes with all of the existing El Grande expansions, of which I have only tried Colonies & The Grand Inquisitor (which I throughly enjoyed, and added much to the game's depth without radically altering its mechanics).  Suffice to say, I really enjoy this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The first and still the best area majority game I have played, El Grande was my first encounter with Kramer's magical intuitiveness of design. His games have unmatched flow and are case studies for every aspiring game designer. El Grande, in particular, seems to share the DNA of eternal abstract games such as Chess and Go. The retro looks is an acquired taste. I was at first prejudiced against it, but I came to like it. It now brings me atavistic reminiscences of medieval Spain, just like Roland Orzabal's Sketches of Pain (a perfect soundtrack). Scalability is an issue: it is possible to play it one-on-one (I did it, and the game ended in a draw at 60 points!) and it is quite nice with three players; but it should really be played with four or five. In my case, this prevents me from playing it as much as this fantastic game deserves.

RATING: 4
* Played 5+ times. I don't quite understand the immense popularity of this game; I find it scattered and unfocused. My fellow gamers tell me I just need to keep trying it until I understand the strategy then I'll like it. Maybe...but I think I simply don't like 'influence' games (San Marco, Urland, etc.) // Played with 5 players and began to like it better. Honestly, I still find it chaotic, but enjoying it more regardless. [Can't Stop/? traded for this. Sold.]

I don't rate this as high as others do because if a player is not familiar with the cards he is at a great disadvantage.  I own so many games that I don't enjoy having to memorize parts of a game in order to play it decently against others who play it regularly.  If I played this game more often, I would probably rate it higher.

The first 2/3 is pointless because if you jump out ahead, everyone will just gang up on you.  It feels like a game that could have been done in 45 min.  I'm interested to try the expansion with the powers on the cards you choose.  It should add some strategic element to the first 2/3 of the game.  All that said, I'm actually raising my rating a point because I'm continually suggesting this to play with the family and very much enjoying it.  Here's it's actually beneficial that everyone can gang up on the leader and everyone is in the game.

RATING: 4
[Area control, Special powers] [5P:5, 4P:4, 3P:3] I understand how others can enjoy it, but it's too dry and tactical for me. You can't plan any further ahead than the current set of action cards (because you'll never know what's coming up). Repetitive and, honestly, boring as dirt. *** UPDATE: Okay, I can expound a little more on EG now that I played again, and still didn't take to it at all. Your work doesn't stick. It's transient. It's chaotic. It's impossible to build anything. You're blind and stone deaf beyond the current turn, and there's nothing you can do now to set up for later success. It's irritating. I can't fault the design, I can see how some gamers like the "live for the moment, score points now" personality of the game, but I can't abide it. Bleh. ***UPDATE: Following a lead from the esteemed Chris Farrell, am considering El Grande + Expansions, which seems to remove my main issue with the game by eliminating the randomness and blindness from the action cards. Under evaluation, we'll see when the reprints (RGG is reprinting both El Grande and the Expansion Kit) roll around in October 2005.

There are many things I like about El Grande: 
- I love the way I can never be completely in control of what happens, but yet can influence the gameplay in significant ways, especially if I can get inside the minds of my opponents.  The element of bluffing is very cool.
- I love how the castillo gives you those "gotcha" moments.  That element of guessing where your opponents are going to place their castillo cubes adds a superb amount of tension and suprise.
- I love the simple way auctioning with your power cards is implemented - great stuff!
- I really like the amount of confrontation in this game.  After playing a lot of your normal non-confrontational Euro-fare, playing this was like scratching an itch I didn't know I had.  The player interaction is very direct, and can get very mean!  But hey - if your children can handle Sorry!, they can handle this.
- Overall, I thought the mechanics of this game meshed together exceptionally well, leaving me with many good options and very difficult choices at every turn.

This is among my favorite area of control games.  It can be a big longish, especially with new people.

RATING: 7
San Marcohoz hasonló játék (vagy inkább fordítva). Itt is a megfelelő pillanatban a megfelelő helyen kell többséget szerezni. Itt is különféle kártyák kijátszásával lehet ezt elérni. Itt sokkal többféle kártya van, mint a San Marcoban, és itt a kártyákat egy speciális licittel szerezzük meg, szemben a San Marco "én felezek, te választasz" mechanikájával. 

Tetszett a játék, szívesen játszom még vele. Elsőre kicsit nehéz volt átlátni a nagyon sokféle kártyát, de a játék végére már kezdtem megérteni az ábrákat rajtuk, és így nem kellett a sok szöveggel bajlódni. Az első játék után egyetlen negatívumot éreztem: szerintem túl nagy a királycsinálás lehetősége ebben a játékban. Szoros állás esetén, simán el tudja dönteni egy-egy hátul lévő játékos azt, hogy kié legyen a végső győzelem.

------------
Ez a királycsinálós dolog az amúgy nagyszerű játék leggyengébb pontja. Igazából az a baj, hogy a játék végén nem az van, hogy valakik(k) királyt tud csinálni ha akar, hanem szinte minden esetben muszáj is neki. Egyszerűen döntenie kell, hogy a-nak vagy b-nek nyeri meg a játékot. Ez sokat ront az amúgy nagyon taktikus, strategikus játék összképén... :(
8->7

----------------
Megfogalmazódott bennem, hogy mi a legnagyobb bajon vele: rengeteget lehet és kell is rajta gondolkodni, de ehhez képest túl sok múlik a véletlenen, dolgok egybeesésén.

RATING: 6
El Grande is an area control game (if not the prototype of the genre). Quite unordinarily, it doesn't show its age at all and can easily keep up with newly released games.

What makes the game interesting are the action cards that additionally also specify how many followers you get to dispatch to the various regions of Spain. Some of these cards are notably stronger than others, and combined with the bidding process that's used to determine who can choose what this adds a certain amount of luck. Also a bit too dry for some.

Really drawn to it initially, but on repeat play really turned off by the chaos of the "secret" extra ability cards which seem to inject too much randomness and bluffing into a game that is so thinky elsewhere. I think the game is brilliant in many respects, but disappointed all my games seem decided by the difference in how those wild scoring bluff minigames panned out.

I always enjoy this game, even though I don't get the opportunity to play it very often. It's what I would describe as as a hybrid of a "German" game and a light war game. Lots of tough choices to make, and just enough randomness. Great game.

nice majority game but it has some minor things I don't like that much.
- sometimes the question where to send the people from the castello comes down to a 50:50 guess where another player will send his.
- sometimes the timing when certain actioncards appear can make a big difference where you don't have enough time to prepare for.

I played a couple of games of El Grande, thoroughly enjoyed it, bought my own copy of the super deluxe re-issue, took it to my local game night, got through half of a teaching game that folks abandoned partway through in favor of a movie, and that's been it ever since.  I really, really have to dust this one off and give it another go.

Very cool stuff. The player-interaction is pretty high, the rules are elegant and build up a challenging game. It definitely lives up to its reputation in my opinion. Although it's an older game, the mechanics are still more fresh and solid than most new designs. The only reason why I only give it seven points, is that I have been playing a lot of area-majority games and I am a bit burned out.

RATING: 9.528
Decennial Edition contains all expansions (and some cards with missing text - poor QA for a Decennial). Apparently one of the seminal Eurogames, it is a game with a most elegant design. Not as good for two player game, ok with 3 players, good for 4 players, and terrific with 5 players. Rating is for 5 player game as this would be the only time it is brought out. (14/12/08). UPDATE : A few more games, and It's still with 5 players a very elegant game (29/11/11).UPDATE: given the expansion included (King & Intrigue) is included in my version, and this game is equally good (but significantly different), the games rating increases by 1 to 9 (30//11/12). UPDATE: With 5 players and the included expansions, this game is still so elegant (Rating 9.528, Dec 2015)

El Grande is a great Euro.  Trying to build influence in each of the territories by placing the members of the court throughout Spain works very well.  Trying to balance the number of people you hire from the provinces into your court vs. the level of power and number of people from the court you can release is very well balanced.  I like that you must also balance the powers you get and the powers you want to stop your opponents from getting.  You also have to keep in mind the number of people you deposit into the castle, which can be good for points and offer a huge advantage in terms of overpowering other players in Spain.  This game is one of BALANCE, all the time.  Too much or too little force in one aspect can lose you the game.  It is occasionally frustrating, considering the choices you can make, and with no catch-up mechanisms you can really find yourself falling behind in a 5-player game, but overall it's great!

There's something that just doesn't click with me with these area majority games like this one and Louis XIV. Although I kinda know what to do, I always concede the valuable areas to the players who are more experienced and confident. I usually end up maybe not last, but nowhere near the lead.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Although El Grande is the quintessential area control Euro, it has never been able to become a favorite of mine.  The tension is there; the decision making is there, but something is missing.  For me it may simply be the consistency. By this I mean El Grande offers a different experience each time -not in gameplay, but in fun.  Sometimes I am completely absorbed, and at others I am bored and find it dry (I love Colovini by the way).  Regardless, I find El Grande to be an extremely substantial title, that has proven itself now for ten years, and will be one I play easily for ten more. It just never will be a first choice.

UPDATE: This game is a supremely solid design.  With a few more plays this has begun to shine.  It needs the five players, but if they are there, chances are El Grande is one of your better options.

Lots of interesting things going on in this elegant area control game.  I find the gameplay to be very tactical in nature.  The revolving action cards result in some nice variability between rounds, but you don't really need to memorize the deck to be able to play well.  Moves along pretty well; not so much opportunity for analysis paralysis as you'll find in some of the action point-based games.

The turn order determination leaves something to be desired.

This brilliant classic of an area control game is dripping with vicious little mechanisms that capture the spirit of intrigue and treachery that was the Spanish aristocracy of that period.

The basic game is one of top games ever produced.  It is an excellent choice to introduce gamers to German games.

Impression after one play.  It's not as difficult to pick up as I thought, but definitely a brain-burner, and would not recommend playing with players who like to think too much... well, anyway, I'm probably guilty of that!  I got into an early lead, but at mid-game the experienced players caught up quickly, and though I still finished second place, I can see there must be much more in this game that will take me a long, long time to grasp.  Will definitely play again -- rating might go up with more plays.

One of the best majority games I have ever played. Actually the majorities are the only element of this game that matters for the final outcome. And the rules are very straight and clear which is an important factor for me.

The only downside (in my opinion of course) is that the game can get very nasty, confrontational and aggresive. But as usual - everything depends on who you play with.

Probably my favorite game. Or at least one of the definite favorites. Simple rules that are easy to teach quickly, but immensely deep game experience.

I did enjoy the castillo mechanic as well as the king mechanic, I thought they worked well together. The game has simple rules and streamlined gameplay. A good amount of interaction for a euro, but not enough to satisfy the wargamer side of me. I recommend it to eurogamers that enjoy player interaction and area majority.

It is a must have for those who like games where you play for domination. In that way it can be compared with San Marco. The disks we see in the game can be compared with what we find in Maharadja.

Offers extremely high replay value. Good amount of conflict between players. Many diverse strategies available. Depends far too much on luck for my taste.

Pure Euros are fun, but they can often feel samey - you've played one, you've played them all. But this is something special - the extreme interactivity makes it stand out. No multiplayer solitaire here. So it's one of the few Euros that's a keeper for me. And it was one of the first, yet it still feels fresh! What a great achievement in design!

This game is in my top 5 games.  Super subtle strategy.  I think newbies pick up on it pretty well, esp. with the player aides that came with my new copy.

It's hard for someone to win if it's their first time and they are playing with an experienced player, which is probably good.

I suppose it can fall into a kingmaking type of game, but honestly, I haven't seen that.  With 5 people, there's not much elbow room, and people are usually just trying to keep their own stuff and aren't in a position to gang up really.

If I were resetting my collection, this would be an auto-include and I can't see myself getting sick of this one.

KOREA

This is the closest game I've found to a 10. I can see why others would rate it lower. It neither has a strong theme nor is the "game play" necessarily thematic. It's also a bit random in the cards that appear in the stacks each round. However, I realized not too long ago that area control games are among my favorites, and I have yet to find one that does it better than El Grande. Conflict is simple, there is a lot of take that, the cards are well balanced, the dynamic of court and provinces is an interesting push/pull, the Castillo creates a lot of great tension, and the staged scoring keeps your head in the game. Viva El Grande!

EDIT: I still love this game--it's a classic!--but I've come down a bit on the rating. For stripped down simplicity and tactics, El Grande is the king of area majority games. However, lately I've wanted something a little meatier, a little more involved.

RATING: 9
An often-imitated game that's my favorite of the "Acquire/Airlines/El Grande" family (scoring based on ranking players' strengths in various areas or categories).  The heart of the game is the tactical decision-making that goes into the bidding and the selection of the action cards.  There's perhaps more opportunity for leader bashing than I typically enjoy, but the game system limits the bashing enough that front-running is a plausible strategy.

I really liked all the choices you had while playing this game. It left me wanting to play it again asap to try out new strategies. There was enough going on that I don't think this would get boring for a long time. I played with a few of the expansions, but I think I could take them or leave them either way. From what I have seen so far, the base game is plenty challenging.

Spiel des Jahres 1996.

Bought online in February, 2007. Karen canceled the Hobby Town backorder.

My favorite game...along with Agricola, for now.

Easy mechanics after playing just a little. Lots of interesting choices to make. Surprisingly good even with only 2 players, though now we won't play with less than 4. Like it best with 5 when every action card must be used. Becoming a family favorite.

Own the Decennial Edition which includes the expansions.

Very, very good.  I came in second in my first game of 5, I used my 13 much too early. Lost , far ahead of 3rd place 100 to 106.  What can I say?  I think that some of my strategic decisions paid off, but it was still extremely chaotic, and I got bashed early on by the crowd.  I can see playing this with some of Sarah's family-- a lot going on, but very simple to learn, and with enough group balancing dynamics and unpredictable surprises to let canny non-gamers be competitive.

RATING: 9
Several great mechanics melded together so beautifully. I love the area majority; I love deliberating about the most useful moves; I love the 'cold war' aspect of the Castillo. 

I can't decide if the uncontrollable chaos will ultimately wane my currently high view of El Grande. One friend remarked, after losing horribly, that he felt his Cabelleros were controlled more by other players than by himself. He refuses to play again. I can't help but think that poor play from unseasoned players created this type of experience. Unfrotunately, another game that needs a certain quality of play for the tension and competition to really shine. I hope I get to play enough to see this happen in my group.

RATING: 9
The big old daddy of area influence game and still the best of the bunch I have played. It is prone to bash the leader syndrome and king making. Generally this is not a problem though since you can maneuver to avoid those positions. It’s one of the more confrontal euros available.

RATING: 7.2
A really solid area control game. You have to pay close attention to what your opponents are doing and gang up on the leader if someone starts to break away. I like how the power cards dictate turn order and knowing when to go first and when to go last is imperative. This is a skill I do NOT possess, which always makes it hard for me to really buy into games like this. I'd definitely play this one again if asked, but it rates just below the threshold that warrants a purchase.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Eight plays. A Euro-style game that has an epic quality to it. With five players it's a nail-biting struggle within a densely interrelated but elegant system, one that rewards flexibility and a sharp eye. 

Some people fault the game for lacking long-term strategy, since so much can change from round to round, but that aspect of the game doesn't bother me; to me it's about juggling a lot of balls and trying to keep everything in balance regardless of what the game throws at you. You need to make choices between early points and cubes on the board, you need to have cubes in your court, you have to be able to get the initiative when the time is right, you have to keep yourself from getting involved in pissing matches, et cetera, et cetera. 

Unfortunately the pace of the game can be killed by hyperanalytic players, and players also need a really thick skin or they're going to get their feelings hurt. For those reasons I like El Grande best when people aren't taking it *too* seriously.

This is the big BGG classic that's just never connected with me. I drag it out once every couple years to see if it catches fire, and it never does. I think I'm working uphill here in that I generally don't like games with such loosely connected themes, and I also don't greatly care for area majority games.

I am not keen on watching people reading cards and pondering while I just sit about. *UPDATE* I have been too harsh, this game has real charm as a 5 player chaotic romp. May 10

Surprisingly simple area control game. Place cubes on the board using cards that you draft (one per turn). Every now and then a scoring round gets you points for majority cubes in a region. That's basically it! A nice variety of cube-pushing cards add a little bit of excitement, and the game's relatively quick pace (2 hours for the full game) keeps the game from getting dull.

My first love with board gaming, and just as challenging as when I first opened the box.  I've seen other games use this mechanic, and many are more complex.  But none of them seem to grasp what this game does, in that the game is less about control than it is about influence. Multiple scoring phases keeps tension high throughout, and nobody feels "played" without having a guiding hand on the board.  If the actions to be bid on were more unbalanced, I might consider this a better experience.

This is classic game of area control. In fact, all other games of area control origin from this one.

And, actually, this is decent game, with lot of player interaction (i.e. conflict), simple mechanics and wonderfully looking board (map of Spain). But then again, there is nothing more in it but some resource management, bidding and - I'll say again - area control. There are, definitely, better games which are based on the same mechanism that provide some more fun and complexity.

I'll leave it up to you whether it's worth to own it, or not. This is classic, I repeat, so if you're a game collector and have enough space for [b]really big[/b] box, you should give it a try. Good luck.

Rating after 1 play. I played with a group that had played over a dozen times, I was the only newbie. Still I managed to jump out to a huge lead. I was up by 25 points after the first 2 scoring rounds. It ended up being a 5 point game because of a serious bit of bash the leader. In the last 3 rounds I had people moving my pieces all over the board and doing everything they could to thwart any plan I had made. The biggest problem I have with this is that a few of the people doing this had no chance to win, so all they were doing was potentially helping the 2nd or 3rd place person win (we played with 5). It would have been a shame if 2nd place won because the leader got bashed in to oblivion. Will see how it plays out next time. It was still fun, but I have to be fair in that if I had lost I probably would have said I hated it. I did really enjoy the flow of the game and the mechanic used to determine what actions you could do.

Some people seem to dislike area influence games--but I am not one of those people. El Grande is undoubtedly among the best of them that I've tried. It's simple, accessible, deep, and swift moving. You get screw-your-neighbour without losing control, short-term vs. long-term scoring options, and lots of fun. It's aged very well indeed, but El Grande scales very poorly. Needs at least 4 players.
[EDIT] The action card decks can really produce some crazy games--both good and bad. The decks can really screw you, or--much worse--produce a very poor game. I&K is much better.

A very good game. Not too difficult to learn but very difficult to master. The fun thing is that there is no perfect strategy. You are not only influenced by your own decisions but even more so by other players' decisions. Always fun and involving. The only thing it lacks is the social aspect. I would have given a higher score if it wasn't this abstract, though. The Spanish theme is only there to catch the eye!

This is what I would call the area majority scoring game for people that hate area majority games.  By that I mean that it is so well done that even folks predisposed to dislike it will have fun.  Lots going on, but not hard to learn and there are always interesting decisions.

If you are mildly interested in this but want something simpler and more strongly themed, check out chaos in the old world!

El Grande is a very well-designed game that is simply not what I enjoy. The main mechanic is area control. You are trying to gain a plurality in each area on the board. The main actions you will take involve adding a few cubes, shuffling cubes about (both yours and your opponents') in an attempt to edge them out. 

There is very little "attacking" in a typical area control sense. A hard-fought battle in El Grande looks like one player having one more cube than his opponent, rather than actually driving his opponent out of a territory he wants. It's a game of tiny advantages that has the feel of a shoving match instead of a fistfight. 

Vying for special powers, locking down territories you are winning, and remembering how many cubes are in the large black tower also come into play. The memory element is mostly an annoyance as if you make a point to keep track, it is not hard to remember. Yet forgetting is a huge penalty and may (again) see a player taking lots of points from you by edging you out with a single cube. 

El Grande demands that successful players walk a knife's edge of precision and optimization. There are no surprises, no alliances, no thrilling turns of fortune. There is only optimization of every single action and prediction of the chaos that your opponents may bring to your plans as they seek to carry out their own.

A fun game but I was surprised at how much direct aggression it allows. Don't be in the lead too early or else you'll get hit pretty hard. I like the mechanics but I don't like how the game encourages you to make poor choices just so you don't get ganged up on.

RATING: 8
It seemed daunting at first, but I settled into a groove playing El Grande.  The game is very intense and requires a bunch of thinking/forethought into your moves.  It never really becomes clear who is going to win, even in the last two rounds or so unless you're extremely good at keeping mental tally on what people have and haven't done so far.

The game puts together a lot of different things (bidding/worker management) in ways that are ultimately successful.  

Despite the 2+ hour run time, the entire group was enthralled by the game the whole way though.  There's so much to keep your focus and concentration on, it's hard to become bored or disinterested.  

Great game.

One of the truly great games of strategy. Its true distinction from other strategy games is the subtlety of the various strategic opportunities.

RATING: 10
Elegant with simple mechanics, difficult choices and very little 'down time' between turns. 
Rather light on strategy, the card play refreshes each turn making it more of a  tactical game.
Has more 'direct' player interaction than most Euro style games and is a better game for it.

This is an incredible solid area control euro game.
And by incredible solid i mean, although it's from '95 this hasn't been surpassed yet!
The simplicity & ease, combined with the clean mechanics makes this game still stand out of the crowd.
The artwork elevates the rather abstract game to something of a theme.

Having said that, people with AP can fall victim to the many options they are faced with.

If i liked euros better this would be a solid 10 for me.

A game of area control and bidding. Players have 13 cards with numbers 1-13. Only use the cards once per game. Player bids highest gets to go first and smallest goes last. However, the last player gets to go first next round. A clever game of area control, bidding, memory.

The game has rules like a gateway game, with medium deepness. You are trying to make progress by gaining points rewarded for your clever play. The interaction is high and sometimes can be cutthroat that i love. The components are very good quality, but the artwork appeals to be a bit boring and outdated for me. The gameplay was entertaining however i feel like something is missing there. I will give it another chance, but i can't say this game is the best price / value of all time. I don't feel that cubes are my knights at all. After the second play im certain this game won't be in my top10 anytime soon. At the moment i don't understand quite enough the deepness of the gameplay, but i like the ever changing atmosphere. You must adapt to the new situation every single turn. You are trying to choose the best of the avaialable options, but you might be wrong! If you are always in the second place you might be win the whole game in the end. The more players play this game, the better it becomes. It isn't supposed to played with just 2.

A great game of intrigue and strategy.  It constantly has me wanting to do more than my one action, and be frustrated that I didn't have a perfect setup.  I like the fact that the tactics outweigh the random factor, and I love the balance.  

That said, I find it difficult to get this game to the table often.  It is a "brain burner" and requires serious concentration while playing.  I have to keep "shussh"-ing those who whant to socialize.  For this reason I see this as a "gamer's game" and not a social game.  

I also own the expansions, and while they are very promising, I have not had the opportunity to get them in play yet.  I have, however, used "Intrique and the King" as a way to introduce players to the game without the full mechanisms.  It is not quite the same game, but close enough to enjoy immensely, as well as removing a key component that confuses new players.  (I actually played with a full deck, and let players use cards as they wish instead of "building" a deck.)

I can see why this is in the Top 10. It is simple, fast, yet has subtle tactical play. It is an area control game, much like San Marco, and instead of making/taking offers, the players bid for the right to go first. Each has a set of power cards, ranking from 1 to 13. Also, each card has a number of caballoro's, which indicates how many 'meeples' can be brought from a supply pile, which is called a 'province', into 'the court'. Higher ranks have fewer or meeples, while the lowest ranks have the ability to bring out a lot of meeples.

There are also five of action cards that are flipped up from different piles on the side. Players select these action cards in bid order. Each action card has a increasing number of symbols that signify how many meeples can be sent out to the various provinces out on the board. Each province has a non-linear scaling of victory points for first, second, and third place, where dominance is indicated by the number of meeples in that province. So, bidding may become fast and furious if certain action cards show up.

There is also an interesting mechanic, where players may deposit some meeples in a tower. The dominance in the tower gives points, but also allows a player to secretly redistribute those meeples during a scoring round to one province.

After playing three rounds, I finally got it, but by then the owner of the game had an insurmountable lead. I wouldn't mind playing it again, but I don't think I will need to get my own copy.

特殊カードの嵐、と当時は思ったが今遊ぶと全く問題にならない。カードは全公開なので、わからないカードがあっても気軽に人に聞くことができる。とはいえ、毎回カードを確認しながらのプレイはテンポが悪い。加えて、長考しやすいシステムなので、もっとテンポが悪い。
ゲーム自体は他人との絡みと読み合いが楽しい非常に良いゲーム。カードの出方によって、ゲームを大きく変えずにそれでいて毎回展開が異なるのも好印象。
パワーカードを同時公開するバリアントはゲーム時間を短くし、程度に運の要素も入るのでお勧め。

This is a great gateway game. It's easy to teach to new players & captures my attention for the whole game.  Every player's decision affects me & the consequences of each of my actions has a big impact on the present & future state of the game. Each game always has a bunch of tense moments when the hidden decisions are revealed or when you watch to see what actions will be taken before you get to choose.  The theme is thinner than some of my other favourites but that's about the only downside for me.  WIsh I'd have found it sooner!

Prefer to play with the full 5 players.

I'm looking forward to giving the expansions a go too.

The original area majority game, where the theme is stripped down to its abstract minimum. Well implemented as a carefully calculated series of trade offs in the bidding cards, but then the action cards throw a huge amount of chaos into the board position. This is one of the classis Euros, but revisiting it recently was a disappointment. You just can't overcome the chaos factor and often feel that the game is playing you as much as you're playing it. It's also very bland, later games like Liberte and In the Shadow of the Emperor are much more flavourful. Worthy of respect, but the King & Intrigue variant is the only one I'm interested in playing today.

RATING: 5
Pure area majority games bore me to tears, and this is about as pure as they get. Plenty of tactical options save it from being completely dry but there is way too much chaos for my taste. It feels like how well I do is determined by what other people decide to do rather than my own play.

I knew I was looking forward to this for a reason.  If you are planning on going around labeling games as "elegant," El Grande is the one to do it with.  The game seems really deep, with plenty to think about each turn, and yet it's simple to play, and even with my current rather inexpert attempts at the game I've been able to feel happy with my decisions (while still grasping for a deeper level of understanding).  As everyone probably knows by now, it is an area control game with many ways to move cubes around the board and interesting tradeoffs between the ability to do interesting stuff and/or go first, and the ability to get more cabelleros on the board.  Absolutely love it.  Yes, there is a memory element, but unless you are playing with people who are particularly good at counting cubes, it just adds another level of doubt and tension to the game.

Despite the ornate board, it's a typical a cube-pusher of a game and seems to hit the sweet-spot of being complex enough to be a gamer's game without being too long, too fiddly or too complex to attract lower ratings.

El abuelo de los juegos de mayorías es un indispensable. Tiene todo lo que me gusta encontrar en un juego: fácil de aprender, decisiones difíciles, interacción, alguna que otra puñalada, "bluff", frustración y buenos componentes en menos de dos horas. Buenísima mecánica la de las cartas de poder en la que con una única decisión determinas tres variables: meter caballeros en tu corte (aumentar tus recursos), situarlos en el tablero (aumentar tu capacidad de puntuar) y decidir la acción a realizar (puntuar/putear). Más "adaptativo" (táctico) que "previsor" (estratégico) A favor: a pesar del caos reinante (cubos siempre moviéndose) no notas que esté "fuera de tu control". ¡Interacción en un eurogame! Puede jugarse "pensando lógicamente" o con "pensamiento intuitivo" y ser ambos estilos igualmente válidos. En contra: envejece muy mal y perde fuelle rápidamente conforme aumenta el nº de partidas. A algunos se les hace insoportable tanto "caos de filler" en dos horas de duración. Abstracto y con tendencia a "descabezar al lider". Si quieres que sea de jugones hay que comprar la expansión "koing und intrigant"

Area control - good but very dry game - concepts taken and tweaked in other games makes this feel very dated. Turn order issues anger me. five player version is awfull without expansions.

Really like the mechanics.  The proximity rule for placing guys limits the choices to make it interesting and tactical.  The bidding and the resulting tradeoffs are a really good decision, and of course all the low-cost intrigue cards that let you steal the game right out from under your opponents are awesome.  Looking forward to playing again.

RATING: 8
Gioco di posizionamento, ma non solo. Nella scelta dell’azione da compiere - che avviene secondo un meccanismo ad eliminazione progressiva, simile a quello di Puerto Rico - è fondamentale valutare bene la posizione degli avversari: un errore può essere fatale. E’ un gioco di marcamento, in cui bisogna impedire che uno degli avversari si involi, perché non è facile recuperare, soprattutto nelle ultime fasi.

The most important area control game. Once the greatest, still solid. It provides reasonable 4-5p game, which is a big plus. but time length is a little long and the king maker issue also makes it in eclipse nowadays. Also, tactic nature of the game is not to my taste.

Played May 8th, 2007 for the 2nd time.  This takes a little while to learn (15 min), however it's pretty strait forward.  It don't take the 2 hours it says, rather a little more than an hour (at least with four).  It's a well designed game with many strategies and a good touch of luck.  I'd recommend giving this a game play and consideration in your rotation of games to play on a regular basis.

Wonderful area majority game.  The map of Spain illustrated on game board is awesome!  El Grande has a surprising re-playability factor because the sequence that the cards come out can dramatically change the character of the game from one play to another.  Not recommended with less than 4 players.  Five players is best.  Every time I play this, I have an awesome experience.  Great game mechanics, very interesting choices to make on your turn.  I wish every board game was this much fun.  I cannot recommend this highly enough or overstate the profound fun I experience sharing El Grande games with friends.

El Grande is a surprisingly elegant while distilled area control game with massively overproduced components.  The gameplay is very simple yet engaging and interactive (shocking for a Euro, really).  The bits are somewhat gimmicky what with the tower of obfuscation known as "the Castillo," or some such similarly sounding Luchadores name, and secret selection spinning wheels for paratrooping in Spanish court members to various regions.  Of course, I love stuff like that, so it only enables an increased rating in my eyes.  -Great game.

My favorite area-control game.  A definite winner when you have 4 or 5 to play (5 is best).  (I did try it once as a 2-player game - it plays well, but it is much more directly confrontational . . . which may work for some people, but I enjoy the subtle plays available with more players.)

Fabulous mechanics and good replayability.  Easier to teach than expected - nice balance to the play.

Haven't tried any of the expansions yet - the base game plays so well, I just haven't felt the need.

RATING: 7.7
Finally got to play it.  It really is a great game.  A little too cut-throat for my tastes, and I don't like the uneven power level of the special actions.  Even though, the other mechanics ran like a well oiled machine and I had a great time.

I *really* liked how the higher bids would net you less cubes, as would the more devious action cards.  I think this small touch was what really did it for me.  I spent most of the game just maximizing the best actions I could net with the most cubes still available to place.

El Grande is a masterpiece of area control game. Based on the original El Grande, El Grande Decennial also provides same fun like El Grande. El Grande is everchanging by player's choices of tactic cards throughout game. The rule is simple and easy to be learned. Nevertheless, the game is exciting and tactical enough. Even though El Grande was designed long time ago in 1995, this game is still the best area control game.

RATING: 8
Nice area control game with very simple rules but plenty of depth beneath the surface.  Interesting risk/reward mechanic in the "betting" for turn order, the reward being more soldiers to place (which score points) in exchange for turn position - going last is often bad news.

I also like the Castillo mechanic, in which players can place their soldiers into a hidden castle.  The point being that those soldiers can be deployed all at once before a scoring round, this gives you something else to consider and deepens the game just that bit more.

Played with 5 players which apparently is the sweet spot for this game, it did take a long time to get through but 3 of the 5 players were new to it so I expect it will be a lot swifter if played again.  Recommended.

My favorite Area Majority game, and a contender for favorite game overall.

The fact that you get 13 unique cards to bid with makes for a agonizing decision. What makes that decision brilliant, however, is that it also determines how many caballeros you can move from the provinces to your court. You are constantly asking yourself how badly you need to take a specific action. The actions themselves are quite balanced. In any given situation one is much more powerful than the others, but overall they are all very useful.

Best with 5
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I can see why this game is a classic.  Very solid and fairly "pure" area majority game, with nothing else glued on.  There's a neat mechanism where you have cards numbered up to 13, but you can only play each one once. These determine turn order, but the low (bad) ones balance out by providing the only resource in the game, your guys.  I enjoyed it, and would definitely play it again.

If I had to choose, I'd name this my favorite board game. (Acquire is a very close second.) Love the player interaction and the way all the game's mechanics mesh together. I considered this game to be heavy/complex in when I was first introduced to it in the early 2000s, but as heavy euros have adopted increasingly intricate mechanics and rulesets, I appreciate more and more how streamlined El Grande is. 

Some people don't like the attack-the-leader aspect, but I embrace it. You gotta play the players. 

The only thing I don't like is the veto card.

I like it. 
 Everything good what's said about this game is true, but you must realize one thing: you are not fully in control of your fate.  Sometimes general position on the board and other players' best moves can easily put you in 'no win' situation (and YOUR best moves won't help it)...

El Grande may be my favorite area control game.  It's simple and elegant enough to teach in 5 minutes and the action cards add enough of a random "what will be available this turn?" adds more flavor to a game that's little more than pushing colored cubes around.  Surprisingly, El Grande works with 2 players as well as it does with 5.

initial rating, may change slightly, especially after playing expansion

WOW! Everything I hoped for was here.

Tough tough game, even tough to rate. There are so many tough decisions to make in the game all with interesting outcomes. I found a lot of intrigue in this game which was great. Planning is a real b*tch as everytime I do I almost never get to do it, must be very flexible in your strategies, very tactically rich game to be sure. The balance of the game was outstanding, the cards, your bidding cards, the tower, the scoring, all very well thought out. Best area influence game out there I'm sure if you can stand the lack of control (chaos factor). I do see the K&I expansion takes a lot of the chaos away and adds more strategy to the game so I am very anxious to try this, could be my first 10. I still think playing both ways will be very fun but I say that now, we'll see.

[u]UPDATE:[/u] more plays has revealed there is more control than first conceived (once you know the game better you can anticipate and plan better) however I can't wait to try K&I and the other expansions look quite interesting as well (rules read).

[u]UPDATE:[/u]9.25 => 9 After 8 games or so of this and comig back to it after a long layover it now feels chaotic again. Maybe it was just a 'bad day' but overall long term planning is pretty much out, this combined with the limited control now subtracts for me hence the rating drop. I still think it is a brilliant, elegant and fun all-time classic but it does have slight downsides.

I have also played K & I and it was not the "be all end all" I hoped it was and it was very AP prone and dragged on. Since control in the original is starting to bother me more I will have to try the expansion yet again....

Loved this game when I first played it, but since then I've bumped my rating down from and 8 to a 6.  The game feels a little too opportunistic to me.  I like games that have a little more long-range planning.  Basically, too tactical and not strategic enough.

TRADED: Received Merchant of Venus (also traded T&E to get MoV).

Lightly-themed area control game.  Players bid on action cards which affect the placement of "caballeros" in areas and sometimes scoring.  Action cards are beautifully balanced given their variety.  Can be a little too computation-heavy.  We use a chess king in place of the king piece provided with the game--it looks cooler and is the subject of far fewer jokes.

Classic area majority game. The rules are light so this helps as a gateway game for new players to learn area majority games. The strategy changes with every different combination of the 5 action cards. The Castillo adds to the tension of the game as they allows players to suddenly turn some majorities in their favor every 3 rounds. This game doesn't show its age and is still one of of the best area majority games out there.

Bokkensprong 17/10/14 met Sander, Pascal, Roy en ik. Doel: punten scoren door op gezette momenten de meeste troepen in specifieke gebieden (Spaanse provincies) te hebben staan. In elke provincie is een te verdienen score opgegeven voor de grootste, tweede en derdegrootste troepenmacht daar aanwezig. Indien meerdere spelers daar even grote troepen hebben staan, krijgen ze allen een score lager dan normaal.
Spelverloop: Ieder trekt een thuisbasis (dikke blok in provincie) en legt om de beurt een cijferkaart die de speelvolgorde zal bepalen (de hoogste begint). Tijdens je beurt 1) neem je evenveel nieuwe mannetjes uit de provincie (de pot) als op je cijferkaart staat aangegeven, 2) kies je een actiekaartje, 3) zet je evenveel mannetjes op het bord (of je steekt er een aantal in de toren) als aangegeven op je actiekaartje, 4) voer je de actie uit (vb. verplaats de koning; verplaats troepen; reken één provincie af, etc.). Puntjes 3 en 4 mogen ook omgewisseld worden. Om de drie beurten wordt de toren geleegd, krijgen de grootste troepen daar punten voor, en mogen die troepen in een (geheim te kiezen) regio worden bijgeplaatst voor alle provincies worden afgerekend. Super spel zonder al te complexe spelregels. Een topper voor mij!

Still, it fills in nicely when you can't get the real game to the table. All in all it's a game I haven't WANTED to played in years now and have been debating just trading it away.

RATING: 6.4
The grand-daddy of majority/scoring games. Over nine turns, players manipulate their control blocks of wood on the board, to try and make them score as many of the regions as possible. Getting them to the board is a three step process, and once on the board they can be moved and removed by events. Lots to think about and certainly rewarding when you win, but boiled down you are never far removed from moving coloured cubes around a board. Several expansions are available.

RATING: 9.5
What a great game!  There is randomness only in what cards come up - but no randomness that affects if a player will win or lose - that's left up to skill!  A great game that is not a brain burner.  It's fun and social and very competitive.  The expansions only make it better by allowing for variations.

RATING: 7
Mildly enjoyable but doesn't scratch my gaming itch as much as some other games.  Area control, getting points through dominating areas with your pieces.  You have to make trade-offs between a number of factors including getting more pieces into play, the number of pieces you get to place at a time, and getting first choice at a number of special actions.  Lots of trying to figure out what everyone else is up to and out-maneuvering them as there are a variety of options and a variety of territories with different values.  If that's what you like, this is a very good game.  A typical eurogame in that the theme is a bit thin as the mechanics are rather abstract.

Rated after one five-player game.  After a slow start I got the hang of this game and it played very well.  Surprisingly the two low-runners (myself and another new player) managed a good comeback and at the end I finished a respectable 3rd.  I can certainly see why this game has the reputation it does - a great area control experience.

RATING: 7.8
Great game, elegant mechanics, scales well and plays out in a decent 60-90 mins. Lots of interesting decisions, and every decision is potentially a critical one, which is how I like my games.

On the downside, I'm not enamoured with the graphics, and the theming doesn't do anything for me. All a bit too Rum & Raisin Cadburys. Does fit well with the game though.

Played around 4 games with only 3 people.  Really don't understand what the big deal is.  I guess I just didn't get it.  I also heard that the game was a totally different experience with 4 or 5 players.  Maybe that would change my opinion.  Along with more play sessions.

I really like it, but I also seem to see some things that trouble me as well.(Decay of Authority card broken in 2 player game?) I just bought it and have mostly played 2 player, and a couple 3 players. I really need to give it a better chance. I have high expectations for this game, so I'll wait to rate it.

I like this game after playing it 20 or so times (unrecorded here)with max players.

Good solid game with more players, the more the better!

One of the best area control games out there. I've played with 2, 3, 4 and 5. Pretty good with 2, very good with 3, excellent with 4 and 5. It has a lot more screwage than other area control games, but it's well done and not overly frustrating. Every phase of a turn offers agonizing decisions. A winner that I expect to be in the rotation for a long time. Upped rating from a 9 to a 10 - this is my favorite area control game, hands down, in spite of it's relatively inferior play with 2 players.

Para mi uno de los mejores juegos que existen. El hecho de que se juegue sin dados hace que el unico factor aleatorio sean los oponentes.

El único inconveniente es que los jugadores novatos lo tienen muy dificil en su primera partida contra jugadores con experiencia.

Initial Rating: 8.5 (August 2010)

A GREAT gamer´s game. The father of the Majority games. 

Its reputation is totally deserved. El Grande has simple mechanics and can be explained quickly to new players, but it also has a surprising and satisfying tactical/strategic depth. This is one of the few games that I enjoy with the full complement of 5 players as the tension goes up with the bidding (it also plays well with 4 players. Not recommended with less than 4 players), also you don’t feel the downtime as you are planning all the time. It has a "screw your neighbor" feel so if you enjoy this kind of thing go for it you won’t regret it. The luck factor is relatively low (another plus for me).

On the bad side the game lends itself to unintentional kingmaking by a player with less relative skill and/or experience.

I totally recommend it, one of my favorite Euros.

I have changed a lot during my 5 yearlong gaming career. I (generally) no longer enjoy games in which the “attack the leader” mechanism is prevalent, however El Grande has a special place in my heart so it continues to be among my favorite games. I’m still decreasing its rating but it is a solid game. I won’t ever sell it.

Classic of area majority games. Each player has a set of Power cards 1 to 13. In each round, highest card gets first choice of the five special actions on offer that round. Cards and actions increase the men in your reserve, other cards and actions let you play more or less men onto the board. Each space on the board has points for 1st/2nd/3rd.

Enjoyably different. A tight set of various mechanics work really well together, and the theme is completely in keeping... not a 100% natural theme layer, but completely in keeping.

A very good game. However, it is essential that you play this game with good players.

El Grande is abstract and that's something that you have to like and get. It's merely thematic and you can win by calculating easier then your opponents.

I've wanted this game for two years; finally found it in a game store - and pulled the trigger!

Maybe because I waited so long for it (a lesson in abstinence, youth of America), but it was great, even with two players.

The box reads "a subtle game of strategy."  There really is no better way to describe this game.  You have many different options on your turn, different actions you can take or not take, but they all seem to make sense.  I can only imagine how cool this game will be with more than two players.

El Grande is an outstanding game with deep strategy, dramatic interaction, and a healthy amount of tension. The use of the power cards to bid for card order is practically a game within itself; the action cards keep the game dynamic and full of suspense; the castillo and secret disks add even more layers of strategic decision making. This smooth, elegant classic defined area control and I haven't seen another game that does it better.

I've played this game twice now, with the two sessions being about a year apart, and while I enjoyed it more the second time because I had a better grasp of what was going on, I'm still not ready to rate it an '8'.  I like the strategic angle to the bidding, and the area control aspect works well, but I have a (personal) lack of enthusiasm for myriad special powers, embodied in the action cards in El Grande, and I'm not yet convinced that the interplay between bidding cards, action cards, and the caballero province-to-court-to-board pipeline is ideal.

Got the gist of it pretty well, but wasn't sure I enjoyed it all that much. I can see why it appeals to some, but El Grande and I just didn't hit it off.

RATING: 7
I like to call this a game of controlled chaos. You're looking to score points based on having a majority(1st/2nd/3rd)of pieces in each region. However the board changes, often dramatically,from round to round. And sometimes even from player to player making it hard/near impossible to employ long term strategy.

I really only like to play this game with 5 players as I feel the board is a little too open with less.

RATING: 5
Got this because people said it was better than blood rage - was sorely disapointed. No engine building, no real long term planning, no clever plays, no bluffing, no surprises (except for a tiny bit when stuff comes out the tower) . What it does is ok, it just feels so shallow after having played Blood Rage. Very pretty though

RATING: 5
An interesting game of multiple area control.  This game has several innovations that make it better than similar games - the power card concept is quite nice, as obviously some action cards are much more powerful than others.  You can't complain about your action cards, because you could always have played your 13 and taken your pick!  They balance the game very nicely.  The castillo is also interesting, although it should be visible by all players in my opinion.  Why tax the memory unnecessarily?  The theme is very weak, and the game seems abstract and dry.  Also, it suffers from two multi-player conflict game weaknesses, beat-up-on-the-leader, and two-guys-take-each-other-down.  Hardcore multiplayer gamers might not even think that these are weaknesses, but I have a preference for games where the leader can more easily keep his position through skillful play.  Even so, for what it is, it is nearly perfect, and it is easy to see how it gets such high ratings.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Did not like, boring after a while.  Apparently I like a little theme to the game and this has none, it could be ducks on a pond.  If it was fun I could overlook theme.  For such a high rated BGG game this one really disappoints.

RATING: 9
Every phase in this game has interesting and challenging decisions. Do I go early in turn order or replenish my court? Which action do I want to take or prevent and how badly? How many cubes do I need to move to the board? Should I play heavily to the Castillo or not? Should I use the king to open up regions for placement, or block regions from other players? The specifics of each available action in the current combination makes these decisions even harder, but also more fun. Area majority games can tend to be on the dry side - place cubes, remove cubes, move cubes. I tend not to like bare-bones majority games that are not combined with special actions, such as China. But there are some - El Grande is one, Struggle of Empires is another - that use the base mechanics as a foundation for a variety of interesting choices. I score this game a 9, but it may even deserved a ten.

Finally got in a game with 4 players and Absolutely LOVED it.  Rating it an 8.5 now, but if a game of 5 players is even better, then it may go up from here.

wonderful area control game with some very clever elements added in - like choosing the cards each turn and the tower effectively being a area where the control is hidden, unless you can memorize the cube count as they go in, which I cant and I dont try to do any more.

Enjoy this immensely, what a brain-burner!   Classic area control game.  My favorite way to play is with King & Intrigue expansion, which allows each player to create their own personal action deck.

On my short-list for most perfectly designed games ever.
I love how balanced every aspect of the game is.
For example, even if you bid high in the scoring round, you're compensated for having "less say" by the Castillo placement.

Except for the art work, this is a classic that has aged very well indeed.  After all these years, it's still one of the best area control games available.  Card play for auctions, the Castille, the dials and the King - so many great mechanics all woven together seamlessly.  Still a solid "9."

RATING: 9
Let me put it this way. By rights, with a little marketing (and proofreading, ahem) there should be a whole generation of kids who fondly remember El Grande instead of Risk. The ratio of simplicity to challenge/engagement/replayability is such that I imagine this one will be around in 50 years. 

Don't even bother playing without 5. It won't get to the table as much as a result, but this is the perfect five player game. 

Update: If you like this, you owe it to yourself to seek out Struggle of Empires. Strong kinship between the two, but each succeeds on its own merits.

This is a very nice game of area control. We played with five players which made for a very chaotic game. Some of the cards are used to screw your neighbor and can seem a little over powered. Still there was some fun in having to adjust to the rapidly changing conditions.

Absolute Favourite Game.  Will always play this one.  Comes with a number of expansions, but the base game is so good, I've only ever played a couple of them.  Area control game where you bid on specialty cards to either advance your own stance or more likely backstab others.

I like it. Very easy to learn, and a great game to bring in non-gamers to Eurogaming. My wife doesn't like it, so I think we'll be playing this less and less. I haven't tried the expansions yet though, and that would probably be nice.

The best area control game I have played.  Very high intensity.  Timing is very impotent as is card counting.  Also a bit of bluffing can be useful to trick your opponents is useful.  The Castile/tower really adds to the game. It is very competitive, but this makes it a very fun game.  It plays great with more players.  It is hard to play without taking sides with other players, but this makes it very interactive.
I think some players will not like this element of the game and that it can be so competitive.
Another minor gripe is perhaps some of the cards aren't as balanced as they could be.
I can't believe this game is not in print.  Many modern games are not as good as this one.
Top 10 game on my list.

I've owned this for three years and still haven't played :( Every time it comes to the table we convince ourselves that there's no time to learn a new game, so may as well play another game.  The few people I know who have played it say it's excellent, but don't want to play with beginners since there will be a huge disadvantage to a rookie (this problem exhists in all games and I'm guilty of this myself with Settler's, Carcassonne, Agricola, Princes, Ra, the list goes on.  One day the perfect conditions will exhist for it to finally be played.  And I know it will be awesome....

El Grande is a classic game that has been in my collection for a couple of years. I've only played it twice, because not everyone likes this game, so it doesn't get much tabletime. This is a very pure area control game, that can get very mean. It is an absolute thrillride for me. However, Chaos in the Old World prevents me from forcing it to the table more often. UPDATE: Sold it, because I hardly play it and two of my friends also own a copy.

RATING: 8
Fun area control game that presents tough and interesting choices. Tactics within a single turn are more important than long term planning. [Follow-up edit: I think that long-term planning of the use of your bid cards is very important; in particular the flexibility in available bids at points of scoring.] The gang-up-on-the-leader potential is a minor annoyance. The theme as irrelevant to the actual game play. The Castillo is a brilliant game mechanic. Overall a very, very solid game.

The granddaddy of area control, and still a very good game. Easy to pick up, and the card decks add some variability both in terms of timing and what-all shows up. I like it even though I'm not particularly good at it, and it's the kind of frustration that can be fun (which may not be so true for me and Agricola). It can get a little long; I'm not sure whether the "shorter" variant isn't such a bad idea. I'd like to try the expansions, too, since I have the Decennial.

It's great to see how this game has held up over time.  While many other games use similar mechanics (probably owing a debt to El Grande), it feels fresh and exciting.  While there is a tendency to gang up on an early leader, there is still a lot of room to maneuver and a good helping of luck/chaos.  This could move up with further play.

One of the long standing classic games here, and with good reason, it does have a nice feel to it. It suffers in my opinion worse than many describe Puerto Rico does from different levels of ability. Others failing to recognise the leader between scoring rounds and finding a way to mitigate the luck of the card draws just frustrates me enough not to want to bring this to the table regularly.

I admire the game system, but I don't like its chaotic nature.  Part of the problem is that I have the German version and found it was difficult to play.  I got the English Cards, but the cards were too small to see across the table.  I am not willing to spend more on the game so I gave up.  This experience is why I am very leery of getting German games with language on the cards.

Upon playing it once more, I think I can pinpoint the reasons that I do not like this game as much as I should: 

1. It is too chaotic for my tastes. Who wins is dictated more by what other people do to you than what you do. 

2. It is prone to Analysis Paralysis. There are a lot of choices and a lot of possible responses and some people try to figure out all the possibilities. 

3. A combination of 1 & 2 above. It is too long for the amount of randomness. I feel it has more randomness in it than Settlers and Ra. Whereas Settlers and Ra usually can be done in 30-45 minutes, I am usually looking at a 2 hour playing time for El Grande. 

4. Too much of a wargamers feel to me. There are too many cards that end up you hurting someone else (and the ones not targeted win).

With six rounds there's only a little room for strategies and a lot of action cards become useless, but the game flows nicely. With nine rounds, the way I think the game is supposed to be played, however, the game becomes everlasting. Thinking, waiting, waiting, waiting, boring, oh, you're letting me do some thinking again? I like it less (with 9 rounds) after each play, but I would like to like it more.

I like area control games. While this is the first I don't believe that it is the best. There are a number of important simultaneous selections that add chaos. It also suffers a bit from attack the leader and players falling so far behind that they have little to no chance for over half an hour. I am impressed by the game that spawned so many other great ones (e.g. without El Grande we wouldn't have Louis XIV) though and I don't mind playing it occasionally.

Based on 15+ plays.  El Grande's greatness comes from its well-honed balance of competing elements.  The rules are quite elegant, while permitting myriad crucial decisions.  The subtle random elements provide just enough chaos to keep the game exciting, while still allowing players to plan ahead.  And the scoring mechanism allows meaningful conflict, while mitigating the bash-the-leader tendency of other games.

2015-05-16 - 9->10  After another great play it is 10. Even with three players it's awesome.

2017-10-29 - 10->9 - The game doesn't hit the table as often because it takes 2 hours. It's not that it feels too long, I'm never bored during it - but if it were shorter I would play it more.

I think this is a very good game, and I'd happily play it again in spite of the theme not being at all engaging, the bland components being a big factor in this.  For that reason and because there are other equally good games where the theme really takes hold this is not a game I would suggest.  A secondary factor is that the game needs to be cut-throat and the board heavily contested to get the best out of it, so I'd be disinclined to play with fewer than 5 and definitely no less than 4 players.

I feel similar about this game as I do about Power Grid.  Really good fundamental concept and gameplay, but just held back by a few design flaws.

Firstly the tower - what were they thinking?  Bizarre.  We played without it because it's just so stupid, but then I think that kind of breaks the game, too.

Also the action card decks, there are too many weird abilities available to everyone every turn.

In short, the game is just a huge mess and way too chaotic for my taste.  Long term planning isn't really possible.

Easy to see why this is so popular with so many, but I prefer more direct player interaction.

Plays faster than PR, though, and more pleasant to look at.

RATING: 8
Combines strategic play, auctioning, and bluffing.
Have only played a 5 player game, which I hear is the way to go and unfortunately will limit chances of play.

This is a game of constant turmoil as area of influence (where you can place your meeples or "caballeros")changes and your caballeros get pushed around and you do your best to get back into scoring position by the end of the phase.

And don't ignore the Castillo (the huge wooden tower), or it will cost you the game.  Not only does it count for score at the end of the phase, but it allows you to "paratroop" your caballeros into any region of your choice.  This is the key bluff in the game, because you have to remember what your opponents have put in the Castillo, and also have to assume where they're dropping their men.  Do you need to protect an existing territory?  Or do you think that they think otherwise?  Some good multi-tiered game theory.

Tremendous game with lots of interesting decisions.  The theme is rather dreary, though.  Nevertheless an enduring favorite of mine.

I have the "El Grande Expansions, boxed, stored inside the El Grande base game box.

One of my first Eurogames, having played mainly Avalon Hill designs before. I think I saw or played it at a friend before buying it (thanks Kullberg!) at a local supermarket.

I've got the Swedish edition released in 1998 (w/really crappy wood components -- made out of soft fast-growing pine...) 

Great area influence game w/some direct conflict. Scales well and shines w/five players.

This was a more classic title that I was late to the game on first trying.  I was completely underwhelmed when I did (I even bought the copy with all the expansions in it).  Seems like possibly a title popular due to nostalgic value or for those that have literally not played any other area control games.  I've always been a huge fan of those types of games and there is no shortage of ones I enjoy more...pretty much all of which are far more thematic than this one with better bits too boot.  For more classic games I even enjoy Shogun/Wallenstein much more than this one.

Play only if you're in the mood for intrige in the form of placing wooden pieces on other parts of the board. The artwork is a bit simplistic but serves its purpose. The rules are clear and simple. 
However it feels very fidgety and other players usually ruin your plans, so it's very chaotic without anyone accomplishing much. Then 3 counts, end. Was it fun? Well somewhat, like meh. So 5 points. 
We never play it because the better games win all the time. Sorry.

Grande gets a lower rating from me because it is the style of game that I just don't prefer. Its fun and challenging but I don't feel like I've played a game when I get done... I feel like I've just been through a training excercise in business theory of give and take. I can always be convinced to play but I won't be the guy who brings it up nor would I ever see myself owning it. I can however see the draw and popularity that other people would have toward it. I like the five levels of cards and the mechanics that serves.

Hmmm!  For area control, I think I might prefer Conquest of the Empire II!  That feels like you have more control over the actions available to you, and you can make specific plans which span multiple turns.

The first time I played this (with strangers at Kubla Con), I was one point out of first place, so I was pretty sure it was a brilliant game, ha ha.  Now, after buying the Decennial edition & playing it a few more times (with my friends, who stomp me), I'm less excited about it.  Maybe I'll like it more after a few more plays, or when we try the Intrigue expansion.

Update: after quite a while without playing, I've forgotten how I would basically be the whipping boy for everyone at the table, and so my present mood is that I want to play it, so it's an 8.  Rating will go down when I actually get to play it again, ha ha.

Fun but a bit long game compared to what it is. A lot of going on every round and full of competition which is good. A big risk, that there will be analysis-paralysis, which means that the game drags even more. But is this the best majority game there is? Definitely not. Louis XIV is better: it's faster and offers same kind of experience (or even more).

In this award-winning game, players take on the roles of Grandes in medieval Spain. The king's power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions. To that end, you draft caballeros (knights in the form of colored cubes) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions. After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.

The grandpa of area control games. I still don't know why so many people stick to Risk. Maybe it's the gambling aspect. This was seriously what drew me off. I don't think a strategy game should involve dice in that way. El Grande on the other hand has everything and more - it's easy to teach, with timeless mechanisms and well balanced cards to choose from. And since the Big Box Edition for its 20th anniversary there are tons of new great stuff to explore. A timeless classic and my favourite area control game.

The great granddaddy of area majority games. Still one of the best of its kind. Full of interesting decisions and tension. Seems to be completely tactical but it's far from that. As the different cards in one deck provide more or less samey actions, the game also feels like a forerunner of "one-worker placement" like Puerto Rico and, as a result, a forerunner of worker placement games - here, while the action spaces offer something different each turn, you bid with your cards for the player order (and the caballeros you get this turn) and then, in player order, each player chooses one action and then everyone executes it - just like in worker placement games.

RATING: 6
[2007.Feb.17] Not quite sure how to rate this one yet. The mechanics are truly elegant on paper, but during play the game feels quite chaotic. Long-term planning does not seem to be possible. Additionally, it appears that if a player ends up trailing (in score) by a significant margin after the 1st scoring turn, he/she may not be able to catch-up for the rest of the game.

The appeal of this game has completely eluded me, and I think it might be the most overrated game here.  I'll only play again if I must.

it's a classic area of majority game that supposely inspired all other area of majority games.

It's not that bad and I can't see any bug or annoying element in the game. Still it's not that much exciting to play.

There is a good amount of information to manage if you want to optimize your score. So sometimes I was forgetting a few things. But since I won the first game I played, you probably don't need to calculate that much.

I'm of the opinion that this was a "ground-breaking" design in modern Euro/German-style games.  I sometimes prefer Eiszeit/Mammoth Hunters for a quicker "area influence" game but this truly is a lofty classic by Kramer, regardless of whether it's your cup of tea or not.  You really don't need the expansions to add flavor to an already flavorful game.  However, with five players, I do prefer to add the (free) Grandissimo expansion so that the last player of a round has two stacks to pick from (b/c with 3 or 4 plyrs, the last plyr always has at least two stacks to choose from).

Definitely my favorite area majority game.  Need to get this on the table more often.  And sometime actually play with some of the expansions...:-)After playing the King and Intrigue for the first time, I certainly want to give this variant more plays.

Looks like this game appeals to both wargamers and Eurogamers from the ratings. 

I played this game with a group of 4.  But I don't have a sense of how to accompolish things in the game.  

El Grande is a game about the expansion of your Spanish kingdom to the surrounding areas adjacent to where the King is. By moving Caballeros from your provinces to your court then onto the regions, scoring of which according to the no. of Caballeros you have. Scoring happens on turn 3,6 and 9. So players prepare for the moving of Caballeros with the action cards revealed. The order of choosing the action cards and playing your Cablleros is determined by a power card bidding system, comparing 1 to 13 power value on the action cards, whereas the highest goes first in a descending order. 

Apart from the Spanish map, I find the whole game is very abstract to me. The action cards are randomly drawn and maybe this is my first play, I don't know how to choose the best card in view of the actual exsiting situation on the board. The concept of provinces, courts and regions are just names for the places to hold the Cablleros, simply a game mechanic which is too abstract to me in my mind. 

Well I guess I don't like the Euro game, no matter how this game is highly praised by the fellow Eurogamers here in BGG. No doubt I came last in a game of 5.

So I finally played this classic, eight years after entering the hobby. Another fine example of that era when Euros started from a single mechanic (in this case, Area Control) and extracted the most out of it, intead of mashing up a crazy amount of mechanics to make games with convoluted rulebooks and points being awarded by whatever criteria.

I was taken in by all of the high ratings and, having already gained an appreciation of other Euro games (i.e. Starfarers of Catan), I tracked down a copy on the secondary market. I received it in the mail and tried it... and couldn't sell it on Ebay fast enough. I was genuinely unimpressed.

Area majority is my least favorite game mechanic, so, yeah.  El Grande, to me, is boring and long and frustrating.  I think I'm in the minority on this one, though.

I have parakeetitus, so El Grande with it's nifty Castillo, wooden pieces and lovely cards and map is a big draw for me. The fact that it's a different, interesting and well designed game also helps a great deal.

Verdict: [b]A new favorite![/b] I played this game at BGG.CON 2014, and it was just as good as I had hoped. I really liked the way it played. Even a last place finish didn't dampen my thoughts on this game. It just skyrocketed up my wish list after that one play. I can't wait to play this again.

RATING: 9
Pocos juegos tienen una profundidad estratégica como éste, a lo que hay que sumar que no se pueden aplicar estrategias definitivas por parte de los jugadores, que deben plantearse un plan A, uno B e incluso uno C, por lo que la toma de decisiones no es fácil ni tampoco rápida, algo que puede gustar a algunos pero exasperar a otros (por no decir una buena parte); por lo tanto, una sencillez de mecánica de juego se convierte en un laberinto de posibilidades que hace exprimir las neuronas de los jugadores en un afán imposible de hacer que su planteamiento teórico se lleve a la práctica.
Una profundidad estratégica que provoca una dificultad y una sensación de falta de control de juego no apta para todos los jugadores, aunque a mí me ha conquistado.

Variante:

Sólo se explican los cambios; el resto se mantiene fiel al juego original.

Cada jugador roba una carta de región. Aquel jugador cuya carta tenga una mayor puntuación en la primera casilla será el primero en jugar; en caso de empate, la segunda casilla, o la tercera si hay de nuevo iguales, decidirá el orden.

Se barajan las 13 cartas de juego, y sin mirar se quitan 4 boca abajo y se devuelven a la caja de juego. Las 9 restantes se colocan boca abajo en un mazo al alcanze del jugador.

Turno de un jugador:

1. Coger y mirar la primera de las 9 cartas del mazo de juego. Coger, como máximo, de las provincias, el número de caballeros representados por los iconos de caras en la carta. Descartar dicha carta boca arriba en un mazo de descarte. Conforme avanza el juego se van acumulando boca arriba una sobre otra las cartas de descarte de cada uno de los 9 turnos del juego.

2. Seleccionar 1 de entre las 5 opciones de las cartas de poder y proceder como indican las reglas del juego original.

El resto de jugadores procede de la misma manera en su propio turno en el orden de las agujas del reloj, igual que en las reglas originales del juego.


De esta manera se añade un factor de azar al no elegir intencionadamente qué carta de las 9 (ya no son 13, lo que le da aún más factor suerte) vas a utilizar. No siempre estarás en disposición de realizar la estrategia que tenías en mente, si no que tienes que adaptarte a las cartas que tienes en cada momento.

El turno de un jugador es suyo y sólo suyo; con esta variante ningún otro jugador puede interferir con su carta de acción (9 ahora) y arrebatar el orden del juego al jugador que actuamente tiene el turno en juego. Aunque se pierde interacción entre jugadores aporta dinamismo y simplicidad al juego. De esta manera un jugador sabe que en su turno él es quien manda y puede plantearse una clara estrategia (si las cartas de acción, las 9, se lo permiten) y decidir cuál de las 5 cartas de poder le interesa más porque le favorece más o porque le perjudica más a sus rivales.
El juego original se eternizaba en la toma de decisiones ya que una vez el jugador tomaba una decisión y en consecuencia jugaba una carta de acción (13 en ese caso), posteriormente otro jugador le estropeaba la jugada utilizando una carta de poder de mayor valor y adelantándose en el uso de las cartas de acción. De esta manera, aquél jugador tenía que replanterarse de nuevo la estrategia, con la consecuencia pérdida de tiempo y alargamiento de la partida.

Con esta nueva variante, la toma de decisiones es más rápida y se aporta un factor de azar más que interesante. Aunque se pierda un tanto de interacción entre jugadores, el resultado es más que satisfactorio.

Wow what a well designed game. I don't think I always want to play it as the level of tactical play is a bit too stressful for me, but there is a lot to think about for a game with a really simple concept of area control + timing of actions. For example, placing cubes in the castle seems really good because those cubes basically get to score twice, but put too many and you put tooany of your eggs in one basket, and also there are multiple actions that let you score regions immediately, which you can miss out on. The castillo or whatever it is called is also a really cool mechanism. That it locks out one region that it is placed allows you to guarantee wins there but makes it hard for you to win that region in the first place, and  that it soft locks nonadjacent regions while making adjacent ones vulnerable to manipulation means at other times you just want it far away from your winning regions. Of course, what you want may completely change based on if you went first or last in a round, which brings up something a lot of euros nowadays lack: gameplay that is highly dependent on group dynamics.

Played once. 5 player. I enjoyed the game. However, I had the feeling of not being in control since there were so many action cards others could choose that would alter my state. I think my rating for this will go up the more I play it. We shall see.

Considering that area majority is one of my least favorite mechanics, this was a pleasant surprise. This game is all about area majority, with people pushing your cubes around and messing with your plans.

However, it's short enough that it doesn't overstay its welcome (even at 5 players). The cards also limit what you can do, and there's a great balance between getting cubes, putting them on the board, turn order, and the special action you get.

My only complaint is the castillo. There's *no* reason to keep that information hidden. For someone with goldfish memory like me, it's not that I forget what other people put in over 3 rounds, it's that I forget what *I* put in 30 seconds after I drop the cubes. I'd play the game again, but keep the castillo information open.

This game has pretty much everything you could want in a classic Euro. It's beautifully designed, full of tension, reversals and tricky tactical decisions that come up out of nowhere. The luck element is strong enough to keep up the suspense without ever making one feel that it's determinative of who wins. My only slight complaint is that it does feel a bit abstract relative to some other Euros with the same virtues, such as Ursuppe and (perhaps most notably) Puerto Rico.

The grand-daddy of the area majority games.  You bid on cards that allow you to place more cubes on the board while at the same time providing new cabalerros to be placed on the board from your supply.  It includes a lower that players can place cubes in and it is uncovered at the end of each scoring round.  The game is played over 12 turns with scoring at regular intervals.  Players get points based on majority control for first, second and third place on the board.  

An old game, but one that holds up very well.

I don't know why but I wasn't totally getting into El Grande. I think the problem may be in the power cards, there may be one or two that you really need to be effective but unless you're playing the number cards last you don't usually have much of a chance at them. Then if you end up playing the smallest number card and have to play your power card last you're punished by playing first the next round.

 I can see some advantages in playing a power card last (even though you are typically left with crap by that time) but I don't think it is proportional to the disadvantage of playing your number card first. Basically the win seems to go to whoever just happened to get screwed the least.

Good game that have been around for 15 years now. Interesting mechanism for deciding turn order and moving cubes (caballeros) for dominance to and between provinces. The various posibilities to move around cubes with the actioncards make the game more tactic than for long term strategies even though there are severeal strategic elements to consider. 
The mechanisms with moving cubes for dominance (and cards that modifies) give the same feeling as in Louis XIV, but with higher complexity. The castill also ads some spice of tactical uncertainty and increases the fun of the game. It is loaded with interactions that if find intriguing and exiting. Might well raise in rank with more plays.

RATING: 3
A lot of procedural complexity and randomness, not for for any attempt at simulation but just to make play harder.  Some nukes like "Decay of Authority" hidden in the decks can totally screw players.  Runaway leader (and permanent trailing player) syndrome make this one to avoid.  At best boring, at worst a painful waste of time.

We really wanted to like this game and, indeed, we had a good time playing it with friends. On the other hand, we didn't end up feeling like we would want to play it again. It is just too chaotic. There is so much randomness to the cards, and they have such wild and varied consequences, that it is hard to plan your game play.

Update after second play with 5. Again, we had a good time playing it, but didn't really come away liking the game. The game really encourages good player interaction and lots of fun commentary, which is why we had a good time playing it, but the basic game isn't all that fun. It is really just too random for us - every turn you get such a strange collection of cards to choose from it is really hard to know how to proceed.

The power play of using a low card two turns before scoring so you can place cards first and then using a high card one turn before scoring so you can place the Grande really seems to follow the winner. I'm leaving my rating at 6. I'd play it again if I was in the right mood.

Had some high hopes for this, but I'm afraid it came across to me a pretty bland.  I like games where you have to make a lot of decisions and weigh a lot of different factors to make the right choice.  This game certainly had that.  It's just that I didn't feel that those choices were ever very interesting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I love the tactical nature of trying to decide which action card will help you the most this turn and how badly you want it.  The are multiple rhythms in the game that work together beautifully: getting your cabs from province to court to region, the three scoring rounds, and of course the castillo.  There are also many opportunities for major screwage. This game never gets old.

RATING: 10
What a great game... the game that drew me back into gaming (along with the people I game with!)

With a bit of effort, I was able to memorize the cards and give myself a chance to play more stategically.  With a bit of concentration, I can remember how many cabelleros are in the castille.  With a portion of self control, I can keep myself to descending to the level of retribution that prevents victory.

Therefore, I am able to play well without needing to invest too much effort.  True,I have had a painfully slow game or two.  Otherwise, it is a reliable great time!

UPDATE:  For a second time, I got into the semi-finals at WBC, but was unable to win.  I jumped to a huge lead, and didn't have the cabelleros on the board to hold on.  What a bummer.

There was a time that I really loved this game, but that love has deteriorated a bit, after playing this game with the wrong people. 

If there are people at the table that are there just to make sure one specific person doesn't win, this game will be a pain in the ass. But if you play with well educated people that just play to win themselves, this is a great game.

In other words, in this game what your opponents do to you is more important than what you do to your own armies on the board. This is one of these games where it is better to stay behind in scoring during the first phases of the game, so that you don't stand out. Because once you do, everyone will be moving your armies where you don't want them.

Minus: 2 - 7

The grand-daddy of area control. If this is a mechanism that you like, you can hardly do better than play El Grande. Even though I own the decennial edition with all the expansions, I have yet to feel the need to use them as the base game is excellent all on its own.

RATING: 7
I have played this more than a few time now and really like it. I think its a very elegant game. The bidding for the cards controling the number of units you get to place, and the cards themselves limiting placement further. Its all a great balance. 

Working hard in the first 2 turns to get set up for the scoring rounds, there is a lot more here than just an area control game. There is resource management and good old fashioned strategy and a tiny bit of luck (in what cards show up)

2005 Comments:

I wanted to elaborate a bit on my comments for El Grande (and the rest of my collection) after reading some of the great comments from several GotW lately (namely Michael Webb aka CortexBomb). 

El Grande is as rich of a gaming experience that you can get. I would classify it as a mid weight to heavy Eurogame takes about 2-3 hours to play. I love the many choices you have to make each turn: which power card to I pick for turn order? Which action card should I take, Should I place men in the Castillo?, Where should I place my caballeros? Which region(s) should I use this card on? Should I use the card first or place my men first? El Grande is actually very easy to learn as the mechanics are very straightforward, yet the game play is so much more involved than the game would first suggest. With only three scoring rounds, you want to be the one in control of the first card selection on one of the at the very minimum, and two of them if at all possible and thus this management of your power cards becomes a meta game inside the main game - and it can create a lot of tension in itself.

I really like the Castillo and the uncertainty of where those Caballeros will end up just prior to scoring and the use of the region disks is one of the coolest things about this game.

El Grande is both tactical and strategic as you have to figure out where your men will be placed as well as how you want to use the various cards available to you. The key to winning is having a presence in as many areas as you possibly can - preferably a lot of 2nd places and a few 1st places if you can manage it. 

Many times as I play this, I will see subtle subversive measures I can take against opponents that don't necessarily look that way on the surface. Im talking about things like playing a card to move some Caballeros (which is the obvious thing to improve a region you are in), but then placing them into regions where they end up tying another player for a position (which doesnt hurt them as they were already in a lower scoring position), but it also drops the other player to a lower scoring position. Often, this goes unnoticed by the other player(s).

This game really only works with 4 or 5 players and a 4 player game is a lot nicer than a 5 player game - where someone will usually get stuck with a card that offers them little or no benefit. A 5 player game is tense from start to finish and I often find myself all knotted up inside when I'm playing a real close 5 player game.

The many expansions to the game each add a new way to play and I've enjoyed using them all at different times. I'll be adding seperate reviews for them under their own listings.

I also have to say how much I enjoy the artwork and components of the game. The board could easily be framed and places on a wall and the Castillo is a unique addition to the game.

El Grande is tense, very engrossing, and will keep you thinking the entire time you are playing. It's very satisfying when you win as you feel like you really accomplished something instead of just being at the lucky end of some die rolls.

Great Area control game. Each turn you manage to send your Caballeros to the different provinces in order to gain control of them. You can not plan in advance but you can take the best option each turn to consolidate your positions and expand your influence. 
As opposite to other euros, you have to follow very carefully what other players are doing in order to select what's the best option for you. Will you recruit and send a lot of Caballeros to the provinces or will you sacrifice numbers for mobility or the ability to punish other players in order to clear your path to the victory?

Meh... Im sure this game was great a decade ago when it came out, but there are just too many better area control games out there now (Wallenstein, Struggle of Empires)...Fell completely flat with me when we played with a full arsenal of 5.A recent second playing has let me allot more warmer on it however. I think the quality of the experience of this game depends mostly on the group you play it with. If your playing with a downer group, its quiet, analytical, and nothing more then just pushing wooden cubes around; with a lively group its a blast to play and watch.

I don't think this game is worth playing with fewer than four players.  Less player interaction plus the fact that you don't get to use the third scoring box in each region allows for possibilities of greater separation between the player scoring and increases chances of kingmaker.

I have an old German edition and need English versions of the cards (msg me if you have them!).  There is something inherently pleasurable about moving the sturdy king piece and dropping Caballeros into the Castillo.

I'm keen to get a few more plays of this in.  After one play, my more casual group kept getting confused about the King Region being taboo.  It has become a running joke.

I played it in my first "batch" of eurogames (togheter with Settlers, Starfarers, Puerto Rico,Tikal) then I went to America for 2 years.
Played again now, it is much better than I remembered, maybe because in the meantime I became a "gamer".
It has a lot of balancing....the caballeros moved from the provinces are balanced witht the turn order and the caballeros moved from the court are balanced with the card strength.

This game is AWESOME! It is beautiful and the components are all top-notch. As Tom Vasel stated, this game is ELEGANT. The mechanics of this game are extremely interesting and enjoyable. The castillo throws in an ability to surprise your opponents if they lose track of your deposits and a neat way to swoop in and steal points from your opponents. While direct player interaction is low (as opposed to the trading done in Bohnanza... also a fantastic game) there is a high level of player influence. The game mechanics offer tough choices of: how many caballeros do I want to add to my court? how many caballeros do I want to add to the board? do I want to invest any caballeros in the castillo? do I want to overbid or underbid my opponent in selecting cards that will allow me to play earlier or later? do I want to move the king to increase my score, prevent my opponent from adding caballeros to neighboring provinces, or prevent my opponent from getting those extra points? Bottom line: LOTS OF STRATEGIC OPTIONS AND TOUGH DECISIONS MIXED WITH BEAUTIFUL COMPONENTS AND RELATIVELY EASY GAMEPLAY MAKE THIS GAME A MUST-HAVE!

El Grande is a gang up on the leader game. If you're ahead after the first scoring round, you probably won't be after the second. I think your best bet is to secure your home region while scoring a bunch of second places in other regions. Hang back in the middle of the pack for the first scoring round while keeping your options open. Then begin to make your move in the second scoring round while no one is paying attention to you.

09/07/99 Bought. I own what I assume is the first RGG edition with the rectangular cards. I'll only play with 4-5 players; 2-3 sounds silly. The only negative comment I have is some of the action cards are not clear about whether they affect the person who plays it or if it includes the Castillo. And from what I've learned from FAQs and questions asked/answered here is, some do and some don't. Amazingly even when the game was reprinted ten years later they still didn't clarify the cards/rules!  
As of 09/27/17 I've played 35 times.

A very good game in which the only thing that irritates me is the Last-Person-Goes-First in card play as it seems very easy for someone to be stuck at the back. You played last in the previous round, therefore you have the disadvantage of going first and not getting a chance to see what card value others play. This really sucks. Later games have come up with much better bidding mechanics than this, so I can't complain too much as El Grande introduced so much to board gaming. Apart from that one fault, I think it's still fresh and inspiring.

Exceptionally sleek and clever design, for getting those cubes on the board, with many subtleties.

A very balanced game. Only problem is that it doesn't work with 3 players because the same player will allways start the betting on the scoring rounds. It also gets sometimes boring when you have to wait for others to take their turn and you cant make your own plans before you've seen their move,

Area dominance game with light, sleek and aesthetic rules and mechanics. Auction system that actually works and feels as a natural and correct part of the game mechanics design. Good flow of play. Quick start with tendency to slow down as game progresses. Medium--range quicksand for AP-prone types. Solid, slightly overrated, and failing slightly on the side of dry mathematics. 

For gamers less strategically inclined or demanding a lighter or more thematically lurid area control game Smallworld is an alternative that shares a light version of similar game mechanics but with the same session times.

One of the first "Eurogames" that got me hooked. Probably plays best with 4 or 5, because of the tower. (Don't you love to drop some of your knights into that tower quickly so the other players don't realize how many you put in there?) Haven't played it in quite some time because my gaming group likes other games better, but I'd love to play this one more.

Update: finally played it again, and I still love it after all those years! Screw your neighbour? Screw all your neighbours!

NL: Moderne klassieker. Probeer zoveel mogelijk invloed te krijgen in verschillende Spaanse provincies. Trek de koning naar je toe, of gooi wat van je pionnen in de toren om ze later taktisch ergens in te zetten. 

Speel het veel te weinig, want ik vind 'm te gek. Ideaal matennaaierij spel.

RATING: 8
Game in a Nutshell: Basic area-majority game that gets spiced up with a power card type auction for turn order and action cards that allow special events on every players turn.

Played as: 4 player

Played with: Base game only.

Pros: Great execution in game design were simple rules meet good player interaction. Some action cards are just plain brilliant like secretly selecting territories to score and not scoring territories selected by multiple people.

Cons: It's a shame it supposedly only plays well with 4 or 5 people, an area where many other games shine, so it's in a dime a dozen niche. The game won't bring anyone in for its attractiveness.

Other: I'm really excited to try it with five people where I imagine action selection being much harder fought over and scoring regions a bit more tense. Also, I don't see what the big deal is about making sure you get the decennial edition. Apparently all the expansions suck and the base game is so good by itself, why bother?

Best Use: A good 'next step' game for people looking past the usual gateways.

There are few games that enthrall me like El Grande does. After a game of El Grande, I'll find myself thinking about it again and again for the next couple of days.

The theme is a bit dry and the art a bit dull, but the gameplay is neither. I love it because there is some much interaction between players, but only mildly 'take-that'. There's plenty of room for strategy and tactics, but also enough chance to save it from being too heavy or serious.

This is one of the few games I've seen that still feels fresh and innovative at 20 years old.

Don't fall for the common myth that the game is strictly a 5 player affair. The game is also great at 3 or 4 players. It takes out some of the tension of the power card bidding with fewer than 5 players, but rounds are also significantly faster.

Fun only if strictly 5p, and players are quick thinkers.
There is a huge amount of possibilities each turn, which do not make sense to think longer than a minute about because there are simply too many things your opponents can do to foil your carefully thought out plans. This gives a somewhat chaotic feel to the game, and bogs it down if players are going to analyze everything.
If players are quick, this is still a fun game with plenty of screwage factors and a smash of bluffing involved.

It's a fun game, similar to History of the World but nicer because there's no dice rolling. Drawback to this game is playing with weak players usually will lead to either a lopesided game, or gangwarfare on the 1 player who is doing the best. Also, having a game piece as the score indicator on the board is stupid, especially in one game when someone threw it back at me because he thought it was an errant piece since I had scored so high beyond the other players. Lost that game by one point, still wondering if my scoring piece was put back on the right spot

This is an amazingly good game.  However, for some reason I just don&#039;t want to play it very much.  I think it has to do with the higher focus on screwing over your opponent.  Most games, at some point, major screwing is needed.  This game makes a constant bending over necessary and when you have some very competative players...tensions can be high.  Web of Power (Kardinal und König) has some simular strategies but is far less stressful.

I like this area control game, but like many area control games, it's hard to catch up in this one once you are far behind. You only have limited people, and limited ability to put them on the board, so you can find yourself hopefullessly locked into bad territories for too long. Of course, when I played San Marco last time, the dice killed me so bad that I started to hate luck mixed with my area control too. I can't win! Maybe I don't love area majority games, even though I really like AOE III. My second play of El Grande was more enjoyable than my first play, but I don't think I could play this one all the time.

The main drawback is that a player is too much at the mercy of his collective foes.  You want to make optimal plays, but you also don't want to be the clear frontrunner as you will be walloped.

This game is *my game*.  No one beats me in El Grande!  No one!

Well, okay, I may have lost once.  It was a fluke.

This is really a terrific game.


"Can I move the scoreboard from the King's region?"

"No, you can't do anything in the King's region."

"Can I put this scoreboard into the King's region?"

"No, you can't do [i]anything[/i] in the King's region."

"Can I drop my Castillo guys into the King's region?"

"No, you can't do [b]anything[/b] in the King's region."

"The card says I can move all the Caballeros from one region...."

"I can't begin to count how many times people have asked me this. When explaining to the rules I say "The king is throwing the biggest, most exclusive party in Spain. When he rolls up the doors close, the bouncers are posted at every entrance, nobody gets in and nobody leaves until he's done.""

Oh. This is just not good with two, is it? Really didn't do much for me; can't see why I'd play this rather than Condotierre.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a well balanced game. I played it with 2, 3, 4 and 5 players. It always keeps it up. With two it's a more predictable game. Once one of the players falls a bit behind, it is very hard to come back from that if the other plays smart.

The game is simple in it's rules but for the unexperienced player it can takes about 3 round to get the point of it. Cause than you can witness the effect of scoring.
Choices in this game are never easy. You even need to "battle" for the turn order and you can't always go first. Planning is necessary but you can't plan far ahead. There are always unexpected decissions by other players, sometimes in your favor, sometimes not. 

Never will I refuse to play this but it's maybe a bit too abstract for me to score higher than 8. In the end you are just moving cubes. The story works fine as a theme but it's not much more than some nice background story.

What a clever game. On the surface there is not a lot going on: just your own cubes and a few cards. No resources, money, etc. Each turn you only pull a few levers but each lever turns at least two gears and each choice is actually a balancing act on two, three, even four axes. Really great.

I guess this is the game that spawned a thousand immitators, great. That just makes me want to dislike even more this plodding, characterless game where you plop a cube on a map somewhere to score a point somewhere down the line and hope someone else doesn't plop 2 in the same place a few minutes later. Way too slow with 5, I think it'd probably be quite fun with 3, but overall it is the kind of game that fails to connect with me.

RATING: 7.5
A thought-provoking area-influence game that feautres lots of player interaction (players can move opponents' pieces at many times, unlike in Louis XIV).  The game focuses around rounds wherein players bid for play order, choose between one of five cards that have various actions, and then place variable numbers of markers in regions of the board (Spain).  The game takes a decent amount of time to play (especially due to the many action cards available), but strikes me as having much replayability due to the large number of action cards available (and how much they influence play).  The game is very tactical, which I like.  I'm not sure whether I prefer Louis XIV (which is somewhat more predictable, at least during each turn) or El Grande (which is more interactive).  Both seem like the would be more fun with experienced players.  Looks like I've got some work to do :)

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a really good game.  It's easy to introduce new gamers to (before I scare them with all the bits in Puerto Rico and Cities/Knights version of Settlers of Catan), and makes for a very enjoyable session.  I've been playing this for a few years now, and it's "aged" very very well.  Excellent design, difficult decisions to make, nice components.  Highly recommended, all self-respecting "german game" players should own this one!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
One of my all time favourites. In my opinion by far the best majority game although Mr Kramer did a few other very good majority games as Tikal, Mexica and Java. El Grande plays very well with 3 - 5 players.

RATING: 10
This is the first game I bought after playing settlers, so I guess it has a lot of sentimental value to me. It is a slick, no nonsense area control game. I like the interaction of the game, combined with the mix of long en short term strategy. A real classic.

Update:  pretty boring area control game that is no longer anything special. Poor score track without Numbering.

RATING: 8
A wonderfully well balanced game that is deservedly a classic. The game play is simple and quick to pick up. However the subtleties of balancing the need for caballeros and the desire to choose a particular action in the bidding for turn order and the placement of caballeros onto the board and into the Castillo lead to very interesting decision making. May suffer from A.P.

One play was way more than enough for me. As bad as Puerto Rico, Hansa Teutonica, et al. Classic example with what is wrong with so many Euros. Why do Euro designers feel that dry, abstract mechanics, analysis paralysis and pasted on theme make a fun game. Throw in that once you fall behind, you are essentially out of the game. THIS IS NOT FUN AT ALL! Attention Euro designers, games are meant to be fun, not just interesting. Games like these will always be inaccessible and prevent our hobby from growing.

A highly enjoyable euro style game.  The relative strengths of the power and action cards and the number of cabelleros you can move is just fantastic.  If you want to go first in a round, then forget about acquiring any more cabelleros.  If you want to move the all powerful king, then forget about using any of the more useful action cards.

This is simply a great game all around.  If you get a chance to play El Grande, take advantage of the opportunity.

A területfoglalós játékok öregapja.

10-15 évvel ezelőtt valószínűleg 8-9 közötti pontot kapott volna, de lássuk be, azóta eljárt felette az idő.

Ennek ellenére egész jó, szódával elmegy, nem véletlenül lett SdJ díjas anno, de lássuk be: vannak azóta ennél már sokkal jobb (akár csak területfoglalós) játékok is.

Hihetetlen, hogy amikor ez megjelent, még Horn Gyula volt a miniszterelnök, az NB1 8. és 9. helyezett csapatát Csepel SC-nek és a Stadler FC-nek hívták, nem beszélve arról, hogy a Fradiban olyan játékosok fociztak még, mint Telek Manci, Simon Tibi (RIP), Lisztes, Hrutka Jani, Keller Józsi, Kuntics, Kopunovics, Kuznyecov vagy a gólkirály Nyicsenko. Nekem meg csak egy évvel később lett meg a jogsim... Nem ma volt!

After 2 plays of this with my wife, we like it pretty well (we each play 2 players then add the scores.) I'd love to try it with 4 or 5 players though.

To me, El Grande is the quintessential 5-player euro. It has very crisp mechanics, amazing player interaction, and even a bit of diplomacy.

Two minor nits which are easy to fix:
1. Don't hide the Castillo. I find game of 'memory' a bit silly since you can simply use mnemonics and count the cubes added in your head. This is feasible since it's the only piece of "hidden" information. Of course, once you have the count you can look at the board and also know exactly how many cubes each player has in the province.

2. The wording on the cards is atrocious - spelling mistakes, sentences cut off, etc. It would be handy to have an errata sheet nearby so nobody is confused over how a card works.

This game is the epitome of excellent euro design - simple and intuitive, while being deep enough to keep things engaging. The downtime between turns was a bit much sometimes, and there was a bit of a runaway leader problem, but otherwise this is an excellent game, and I could see my rating improving with future play. Also, I can see the degree to which it has influenced later games--it's definitely the grandfather of area control.

RATING: 6
Face-to-face, this is a 6. Chances are you'll have someone prone to analysis paralysis, which makes this game take far longer than it needs to be. There's not a whole lot you can consider when it's not your turn, since the board is constantly changing. I don't find the slowdowns to be as bad as with some of Kramer's other games (Tikal, Java), but it's enough that my enjoyment suffers.

The game's okay as a "post-gateway," but don't let the relatively quick initial rules explanation fool you: you have to go back to explanation mode nine more times, once for every new batch of cards. The better pick here, in my opinion, would be Taj Mahal, which is pretty easy to explain and gets shorter the more you play it.

Online play might up it to a 7. As others have stated, there's a lot to consider on your turn, and I like being able to take my time pondering all my options. Even better, other players can do the same thing without aggravating the rest of us with a huge amount of downtime.

This game really blasted us away when we played it for the first time! In general the rules are quite simple but the majority area control management system is so clever that every round becomes a tactical moving of pieces on the board. Also the tower mechanism builds in some uncertainty in this classic board game.

El Grande hat schon einige Jahre auf dem Buckel, tatsächlich zählt es fürmich aber noch immerzu einem der besten Are-Control Spiele überhaupt. Die Spieler übernehmen die Rolle von spanischen Lords im Mittelalter und versuchen die Kontrolle über einzelne Gebiete zu erlangen. Aber auch der Einfluss des Königs ist nicht zu unterschätzen und so muss dieser geschickt manipuliert werden. Jeder Spieler hat außerdem Zugriff auf Machtkarten, die das spiel beeinflussen können. Ein echter Klassiker!

This is one of the few games that I can lose badly but still have a lot of fun playing. El Grande is almost entirely tactical and sometimes a bit random but the variety of game mechanics mesh together really well to create a "leader bashing" game that has a unique and appealing game arc. Most games I've played result in a surprise leader with lots of suspense throughout the entire game. I'd play this a lot more if I could but it usually only comes out for 5 players, and there are plenty of other good games competing for that niche.

RATING: 7.5
I really like the mechanism of the secret disk to decide and announce certain moves. The playing of power cards and the action turns created some confusion. We decided to leave the last played power card face up on the table, so at the beginning of the next round we knew that the person with the lowest number in front of them is the first person to play a power card. Modified the game rules on tie breakers. We did not think that in a 3 way tie for first that the fourth place person can still end up with the points based on the scoring table. Instead during a 3 way tie, all 3 players get the second point value and nobody gets the third point value. 

I do not like the fact that the game does not have a tiebreaker for the end of game. Already ran into that situation, we had to search the web for tiebreaker options.

An excellent, well balanced, well presented game.  Simple to pick up, plenty of variation, thanks to the cards, but always a challenge.

Only niggle is that it's possible to corner yourself if you don't get enough pieces into your court early on - other than that it's a superb game.

I enjoy playing El Grande, but my brain doesn't latch on to multiplayer area control games in the same way that it does to some other, less chaotic, genres.  Or perhaps I'm just bothered by the necessity of lying low to prevent getting dogpiled; it seems as though whenever *I* make a big power play the whole table turns against me for a while, whereas when anybody else makes a big power play they take a turn's-worth of flak from somebody and then it's back to business as usual.

Also I have an irrational hatred of the veto card.  Either I dance too far out of optimal in an attempt to get my special action not vetoed, or I don't, and it's vetoed (for some reason, in the couple of games when it's come up, nobody *else* has ever had their special action vetoed).

This definitely feels like the Settlers of Catan of area control games. It has that timeless feel to it, and it does a good job of making it all about the area control without feeling too dry and abstract. Ultimately, however, I would rather just play Dominant Species. DS is an evolution of El Grande, and I appreciate it more for its thematic integration. I would happily play this anytime though.

UPDATE: The runaway leader problem and the length are both big detractors for me when it comes to El Grande. I'll still play, but I think age is finally starting to catch up to this one.

Still a better version than the new big box one from Z-Man.

I love this game. The theme and styling is very much as a 'grown-ups' game. That might make it a good one for introducing non-gamers to the hobby, but it's fairly complex for newbies. Plays well in my opinion with 4, as well as 5.
We don;t play this enough in my opinion - will try and get it to the table more in 2011, and see what that does for it's score - I LOVE the artwork and game mechanics.

Well, after playing this at Drews house (Drew1365) I left basically with my jaw on the floor and totally amazed.  This one is a must.   I knew I wanted to go out and get it.  So I checked the internet.  O.K, this is not going to be easy, I kept on getting "Out of Stock or Out of Print".  Then I used this website and found a copy on ebay.  What luck for me, because there was one for sale in the Twin Cities area, and my sister in law lives there.  A few phone calls later, and its mine!

Shes going to bring it up to me on 8/11/07 when she picks up her son.  

I just love the 2 basic elements of the game, bidding and territory control.  Its like any bidding card game (pinochole, bridge, smear, etc) combined with risk, which is right up my alley.  The best thing about this game is that its 100 times better than risk.  

I'm looking forward to play it soon, when it arrives, and I don't ever forsee this game collecting much dust.  A solid staple for any gamer and I'm gald to have this in my collection. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Excellent area control game. Great bidding mechanism. Difficult and interesting choices from start to finish. The more players the better with 5 being optimal as it makes bidding even more interesting and tactical. 

Overall just a brilliant game that's really simple in concept... but the special actions each round require some thought and conservation in how you bid your power cards throughout the game. 

The only thing that keeps me from rating this a 9+ is that it's a bit dry. Now I love the tactical play of this game but you can easily strip out any theme and it comes down to pushing and flicking cubes around the board. That's both the game's strength (simplicity) and a weakness (basically a painted on theme).

A classic introductory game with the reputation comparable to Settlers that fulfills all expectations. Simple and elegant mechanisms where the players compete for area majority by moving caballeros back and forth. The bidding for action cards and hidden placements in the Castillo adds just enough unpredictability. Potentially a kingmaker risk but with all players competing for victory, this shouldn't be a problem. The game could have been a bit shorter as the gameplay gets repetitive in the long run.

RATING: 6
I suspect that the rating for El Grande is actually lower than what it will eventually be, because El Grande is almost a forgotten game in my group.  Because it has been around for so long, it is often passed over for newer acquisitions, even though it hasn't been played a great deal.  Still, it only takes a game or two to be impressed by the amazing design of El Grande.  The game is fun and strategic, and to me it represents the pinnacle of streamlined design.  Every element plays several roles, and this forces you to make tough decisions whenever you choose to act.

In practice, the game can work out to be a little less elegant than it reads, but it is still very fun, and I expect it to become even more rewarding with additional plays.  This is one of the best designs in my opinion, and the result is a very good game.

Outstanding. Game after game you keep discovering many different options during gameplay.  The tactical factor within this game is so deep, because you have to make decisions on the fly at every moment. I've been trying the expansions, but for sure, the original game is the master piece of all. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Overall comment: a challenging game to weigh your options in because everything that goes on is subtle, the game is much more interesting with more players (at least 4). The basics are quick to pick up but the actions that seem to have little effect with few players are potentially dangerous with more.

Ratings:
Initial: 10 (comes with all of the expansions and even has a game walkthrough which makes the game easier to learn)
Family: 7 (not requested much anymore)
Game group: 8 (this is just starting to create a buzz in the group eventhough I have had the game for awhile)
AP rating: 5 (unfortunately this can run high with some players and this severely detracts from the play)
Solo play: 8 (it is good and offers an slightly different approach to the game - I like it with the expansions for the variety)

When purchased: 2006
Recommended expansions: Decennial edition has all of them in it - yes
Age range: 8+
Luck factor(1-10high): 3 (when the new options are flipped the first player can get an advantage in games with fewer players)

Reason purchased: Geek and months of geek analysis

Pros: Simple mechanics and easy to understand gameplay, lots of tough choices especially with 4 or more players, game scores are close and the castillo can have a devastating affect.
Cons: AP in some players(one of the reasons the decision to buy was so tough), veteran players unwilling to play any of the expansions(the game has little variety otherwise)

Recommendation: An excellent buy because of what you get in the package. The base game is a good start and all of the extras give the game longevity.  It may be tough for some newer players to grasp but a couple plays will get them past that
Replay rating: Above average(with expansions); Average(without)
Game value(plays/cost ratio): Above average (solo play has improved this by giving the game a different strategy which improves overall skill and no AP(a definite +))

One of the first Eurogame area control games I played: move units from playing area to holding area, from holding area to board through bidding cards. King marker moves around to limit where units may go and a tower (castillo) can contain units as well.  Fun, expansion cards were fun also. Lots of things to agonize over, such as the Castillo, overloading an area, and parachuting a different scoreboard into an area.

Heard this is similar to Hansa Teutonica, and that El Grande was sleek and elegant while maintaining high depth and easy access. I really want to try this, though only the big box edition is available. Also supposedly best area majority game on the market.

Biggest issue is semi memory aspect of remembering whats inside the castillo. I could play as open info but that would change the core of the game, and I dislike variants and rule changes if theyre unofficial/extensively playtested and statiscally proven/balanced.

Played and extremely streamlined with fast setup and deep play. A tiny bit of bash the leader and memory which I dislike but I found the game intuitively good and didnt strongly feel downtime, and I could see a lot of replay too. Tiny bit of catchup problem, the inexperienced played was behind about 30 points and didnt have a chance midway through. If only it was unknown who was in the lead.

I don't understand why some people call this game elegant. There are too many different cards with many exceptions that always make the game slow down. Also those points in each area just look very random. The game is too long for what it is.

I have played this game about 10 times. I remember I had fun with the first few plays. But now there are many superior area-control games such as Tower of Babel, Kardinal und Konig (Web of Power), Imperium (in New Games in Old Rome) and many more. I just see no reason to play this game again.

Oops...it went down instead of up.  Area control scoring is a mechanic I'm growing increasingly impatient with.  El Grande doesn't have much else to offer.

It's just not the right game for me.

Rating is low because I'm astonishingly bad at this game - have played many times, and think I've placed last in every single session. There are several reasons for this. I realize that it's my fault. That doesn't affect my lack of interest in playing again.

I'm not a fan of Area Control/Majority, but I thought I'd give this classic game a chance. I can definitely see now why it made such a splash back in the 90's, but its dull components, dry gameplay, and uninteresting theme, have left it a relic of the past. Its still a good game, but not fun enough to hold pace with more modern offerings. Sorry El Grande, but there are just better games out there now.

Strategic masterpiece
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I believe this game is the end-all be-all of area majority games.  Every player will first play a card that determines how many pieces they bring from their stock to the ready position and determines the turn order for the round.  After this, in turn order, everyone takes an action card that not only gives them a special action for the round, but also determines how many of their pieces can be brought from their ready area, onto the board.

One of the problems with a game like this is that it can breed 'ganging-up' on people, which is usually not too fun for the one getting ganged up on.  Sometimes it is inevitable that the person in the lead will get picked on, but it is something that you cannot help in an area majority game.  Thankfully, with clever planning and card-play the game does try to balance itself and really is a joy to play.

I really love this game, the only thing keeping it from staying at a 9, for me is the ganging up problem.  I know this can not be helped, but it is a hindrance to an otherwise great, balanced, area majority game.

Subtitle "subtle strategy game" suits it. Only played once, and I want to play so many times that I can play the King and Intrigue expansion. The box for this game is a bit oversize.
-----------
On a second play, my impression is that this game works very differently from other games. I feel as a player you cede a great deal of control to your opponents; whom they decide to vie with can determine whether you will be locked into a tough war of attrition or if you can fly under the radar to victory. There's a lot of thinking and double-thinking, and if you guess wrong (for example, on where to send your caballeros out of the castillo), it can sink your game early on. There's a bewildering array of options for any given action, and it's almost as though each move you make you are playing kingmaker. It should move more quickly than it does, but the bewildering array of options each turn really makes it difficult to figure out what to do.

[ImageID=2056918 small]

El Grande was released in 1995, and introduced me to some game mechanics for the first time. (A) Players bid for ascending turn order every turn by choosing from cards that determine descending caballero recruitment. (B) Players choose their turn action from a limited pool of randomly drawn cards. (C) Action cards to choose from grant ascending special abilities and determine descending caballero deployment. (D) A player can move the King to freeze activity in a territory for the duration of a turn. (E) One scoring territory is "hidden" by use of the Castillo tower. (F) Some actions require a disc that players use to secretly choose a territory. (G) Tie breakers get a penalty during scoring. 

The game play feels very tight and you can never do everything that you want to do on a single turn. Player actions have built in advantages and disadvantages. During turn order bidding, a player might choose to be first or second in turn order, but receive the fewest caballeros from the supply. An action card may provide a powerful special ability for that turn, but the player can only deploy the smallest amount of caballeros to the board. If a player ties another player's control in a territory, both players split points of the next lower scoring value. A player may have control in a territory and then suddenly have that territory penalized by a mobile scoreboard activated by another player. Players may be scheming in a territory and suddenly the King arrives and all activity ceases in that territory for the turn - but the King is not going to stay and players scramble in that territory immediately when he leaves.

[color=#3388cc][b]Play with or without expansion?[/b][/color]

The game is best with five players, in my opinion, as turn order bidding is competitive, all territories are active, and all action cards are used per turn. The Grandissimo expansion adds another set of cards so that in a five player game, the fifth player on a turn has a choice between two actions. The expansion feels empowering and balancing, but it is not necessary. It can make the game longer, as the fifth player might spend time contemplating the choice of the last two cards. I have played with and without, and definitely would play without the expansion when teaching the game the first time. Additional expansions include a replacement for the action and bidding cards, and another expansion that adds a new territory and ships. 

El Grande is one of the oldest games in the top rankings at BGG, and it deserves the accolades. It is beautifully produced, with extremely streamlined game play.

[color=#3388cc][b]Pimp it?[/b][/color]

This is one game that I have never considered pimping out. It is beautiful as-is. I suppose one could replace all the caballeros, grande, and king with miniatures, so long as a dozen units can fit into a territory.

RATING: 7
Difficult area control game. With the way the cards are, you need to keep track of what other people's plans are. You might want to take a card just to prevent someone else from getting it. Seems to require people to work together to reign in the leader. Have to always be aware of the board position of the other players, and not just the score.

RATING: 5
I'm aware my opinion about this game is one of a kind, but I don't enjoy playing it, even if I value how great and innovative it was in its era. I would have probably loved it back then, but now the market offers much better games.
I dislike
-> Even if you play your best game, all your rivals need to take you down is one turn if they ally against you (and that's what would certainly happen if you play your best game). You could argue that you have to hide your chances by not doing your best, but I don't enjoy games that encourage you to perform bad.
-> The first turns are not that important. Nobody will want to get a big lead over the others and they become very boring. They make the game unnecesarily longer.
-> The game is too chaotic.
-> The game promotes AP on the last turns, and the possibilities are endless when there are players deploying after you.
-> Many games will end with someone being kingmaker.

2 player games are much better (you don't have to bluff), but are too dependant on luck, especially with the cards you get to choose in the last turns.

RATING: 9
The area control game. There is just the right amount of control & chaos to make El Grande a modern classic. It can get quite nasty because you can do powerful moves that affect other players game a lot. It's not for those who prefer low-confrontational games. There certainly is hit-the-leader going on but you cannot do too much harm to anyone (and they usually have a chance to prevent things - but it's costly).
Works with both gamers and non-gamers and is excellent either way. Seems best with a full table of 5 players but very good with 4 players too.

El Grande is a good and inteligent area control game. There is some randomness but not too much. The components are nice but the cards could be slightly thicker.

The quintessential German style game. It has got everything: tactics, strategy, a bit of bluffing, a bit of memory, all players facing the same cards (meaning that luck is only relative to the planned strategy), interesting mechanisms that keep the game balanced, limited length, and above everything else GOOD SADISTIC OLD FUN.

RATING: 9
E' il gioco di maggioranze per eccellenza, forse il primo di questo genere. Meccaniche e regole abbastanza semplici permettono a questo piccolo capolavoro di essere facilmente appreso già dalla prima/seconda partita. Nove turni di gioco per guadagnare la supremazia nelle regioni della Spagna. Un gioco strategico che necessita di una buona programmazione, la grande interazione però rende complesso il tutto. Non esiste una versione italiana del gioco, ma questo non dovrebbe creare problemi perché il poco testo lo si trova solo sulle carte pubbliche. El Grande è un gioco per 5 giocatori, trovo che in 4, o addirittura in 3, perda molto del fascino e anche un po' di profondità strategica. Quasi assente la fortuna mentre è utile un po' di memoria per i caballeros mandati nel Castillo. Una partita dura circa 1h30', massimo 2. Un gioco che consiglio senza dubbi, anche se comincia a far sentire i suoi anni (quasi vent'anni). Tra i difetti che gli vengono attribuiti si parla di tempi morti e troppa attenzione che rende il gioco bello ma non divertente. Io lo trovo semplicemente tosto! Nel 2015 è stata annunciata una nuova riedizione.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Highly influential and thinky area control, and deservedly resident in the pantheon of all-time greats. The flexibility in the turn positioning is key to this game, whatever anyone else would have you think. The design as a whole stands up excellently alongside all those lesser games that have tried to subvert it. My big issue with the game is a slight excess of luck, but this is more easily cured with a 'see what's coming up' house-rule for the action cards.

[b]El Grande[/b] was received in a trade (10/28/14). [i]This is the Decennial Edition.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]It only took one play for El Grande to get it's hooks into me and it has since become a top 3 game for me. El Grande provides players with a very streamlined set of rules that offer an amazing amount of choice in how you decide to go about playing the game. Each choice you make has lasting effects which ultimately leads to the "I can't believe what just happened" moment.

My favorite game mechanics found in El Grande:

The Castille: offers you an opportunity to not only score points for majority but also stock pile some cubes to be placed on the board in a location you choose in secret using the territory wheel.

Territory Selection Wheel: Anytime players need to choose a location in secret (due to cards selected or placing cubes from the Castille) you use this wheel. Trying to take into account what your opponents will due versus what your priorities are lead to some tense and extremely fun decisions.

The King: When someone decides to move the King it influences everyone's decisions because cubes can't be placed in the same territory as the King. On top of that cubes can only be placed in territories adjacent to the King. This is usually one of the most contested cards in the game and deciding when to play a power card that will insure you get to select the King becomes a critical choice in the game.

This is a desert island game for me, it is an elegant and easy to understand set of rules that give players complete control over how the game plays out without bogging down in a mire of complex rules and exceptions. Most importantly it is also a game that I was able to teach to my family with ease and a game they can play quite well (especially my older daughter).[/i]

 [COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]- Elegant! This game has such a simple rule set, yet there is so much depth and strategy to explore.
- Plays great with 3, 4 and 5.
- A lot of player interaction, this is not multiplayer solitaire.
- My favorite mechanic is secretly selecting a territory to place/move guys using the dial, there are a lot of memorable moments created because of this (Especially when it comes to the Castillo).
- Great family game, my 9 year old daughter has picked up this game quickly because the rules are so simple.
- For a 20 year old game it still looks good, especially the Castillo.[/i]

My co-worker's loss is my gain.  I recently discovered a couple of guys at work play Puerto Rico together and we discussed games.  One had bought the Decennial Edition of El Grande a couple months ago and didn't like it.  He and his family couldn't figure out the rules.  I traded him family-friendly Ticket to Ride for a week while we got this.  I think part of my buddy's problem was that all of the extra pieces for the expansions are packed into the same featureless square in the box along with the normal game.  It's totally chaotic and overstuffed.  I repacked the pieces in individual baggies and stuck the expansions underneath--haven't gotten to those yet--and offered to teach him the game.  He declined.  He is going to buy Ticket to Ride instead and offered to sell me this at 60% of the price he paid because the FLGS won't let him return it.  Well, if you're twisting my arm... =)  Sweet deal for us!

We love it!  This is the game Tikal wishes it was.  We also thought it much more straight-forward than Puerto Rico.  

Edit: WOW....I'd read it here, but it is incredibly MUCH better with 4 or 5 people.  FUN!  This game is only improving.  It's the new 10 on my list.

Grand classique du jeu de société moderne. El Grande reste un très bon jeu de majorité.
Certes ce n'est jamais que des petits cubes en bois qui se promènent sur une carte, mais le jeu est très subtil.
Entre les cartes pouvoir fixant le tour de jeu, les cartes action plus ou moins puissantes, les décomptes intermédiaires, tout est là pour une bonne prise de tête en pousseurs de kubenbois consentants. A 4 et (surtout à) 5 joueurs les tours de jeu peuvent être un peu long en fin de partie ...

We played our first game of El Grande tonight. What a blast! Even though we did the sample game and read the rules often for clarification (adding a lot of time to the gaming session), we all had a great time. One of the best games I have ever played! A great core gaming mechanism, great components and very entertaining.  We have the expansion and the free set of cards and plan on playing them soon. I can see why so many people love the game. I do not award a rate of 10 very often. I very well may come back and upgrade this score to 10 after a few more plays. Dont pass this one up. Get a copy, if at all possible. I listed the minimum optimal players as 3 because I can not see the game having the same "flavor" with 2 players.

I like the turn order mechanics, and the way you have to acquire cubes in front of you before you can place them. Lots of interesting decisions. 

There can be some AP when the board is getting full.

Play with open tower scoring. If the tower is there, you can still know what's in it by counting cubes, but that slows the game down. Hence remove the tower to improve the game (doing this does NOT give anyone any new information).

There's a satisfying engagement in the valuation of the powers given the current game state, and determining the required bid to secure the card of choice whilst keeping enough bidding power in hand to take advantage of potentially even better situations later in the game. But it's dropped a rating notch or two over the years as area majority games have gradually fallen out of favour with me, largely due to dis-satisfaction with the frequent kingmaking choices required. If you like the genre, this is one of the best though ... as long as you're not playing with analyser paralysers.

What I liked:
- I think the board was pretty, and the castillo was cool
- It is strategic, and it is tactical, within the chaos (see below).

What I didn't like:
- Area majority, which is a mechanic I tend to strongly dislike.
- Utter chaos. You can't plan ahead at all, because you don't even know what special action you will get until it is your turn. Plus the board can change pretty radically from one turn to the next.
- Long (our 5p learning game was 2.5 hours). For a game this chaotic, 30-45 minutes would be a good length.
- Bash-the-leader and kingmaker problems. Both surfaced in the game I played.

With many games, I can appreciate their strengths even if I don't like them. This is one that I honestly don't understand the insanely high ratings. I also can't figure out how anyone would consider it a "gateway" game.

The weight of 3.1 seems a bit low to me, only because there are SO many options to analyze each turn.

Good game and definitely deserving of its classic status. The game can get a little too chaotic for my tastes though with all of the various cards. One too many huge swings caused by last minute cards for this one to really resonate with me.

I love this game.  Great depth, multiple paths to victory, a good mix of known and hidden information, and strong strategic and tactical elements.  I find every game of this we play to be competitive, interesting, and typically a nail-biter.

The one complaint members of my group raise is that the theme is relatively loosely coupled to the mechanics.  One goes so far as to say that "This just wasn't the way things worked in the Spanish court..."  We tell him to shut up and focus on winning, but if you like the theme to be stronger and more reflective of reality, then you'd likely rate this game lower.

I love it when people are rocking through this game. Not doing an overwhelming amount of table talk (play your own game, people!) and not taking forever in their decisions.  

The experience can definitely vary based on how AP your opponents are and how much table talk they are doing. This can make the game really drag. But if you are playing at fairly rapid pace & people are making their own damn decisions-this is the area control game for me.

I have the Decennial version. Enjoyed both short and long versions, better with long version, though.  Better with 4 than 5. Interesting with just 3.  With 3-its a different game knowing that 2 of the choices are going to be unused.

In May 08, El Grande was our "Game of the Month" (vanilla El Grande, without expansion) and really focused on it-playing it every time we got together. This was at least 5 times. It was a highly excellent and rewarding experience, getting to really know the game. 

Then in June 08 we integrated the expansions, one by one and really had an excellent experience delving into those expansions.

The area majority system is brilliant and tough, the turn order bidding is perfect and the whole fits together neatly.  

This game has a flaw: too many action cards.   They slow the whole thing down.  It never feels like it flows.  I want to simplify the game. 

Thus my variant: each stack of action cards contains only two cards (chosen at random), except for the king of course, who is solo.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This classic area control game is still the best of its genre.  Bidding for special abilities is balanced by getting your cubes.  Special scoring makes your cubes on the board relevant at all times.  The King and its restrictions on cube placement is simply brilliant.  The Castillo is just icing on the cake.  Nothing to dislike here.

Can't rate this yet after only one play. It has pretty and interesting components. It is the daddy of area control games. It's got a big box. It's highly rated. It's getting older... we'll see. 8/6: okay, after one play, a few solo plays, I just framed the thing and hung it on my wall. Pieces went into a shadow-box. I am going to pass on the decenial version, I just don't think this one will come out much with all the other titles that I have. I would play it if one of my friends insisted. I am rating it a 5 based on strict definition of ratings. 2005, put on wall as art.

2014: Mark Johnson has a really interesting take on this game, which I heard on his Top 100 podcast series (which I HIGHLY RECOMMEND). I probably missed the time when this game would have appealed to me - between 1995 and 2000.

With Puerto Rico and T&E. and Princes of Florence out around this time, I can't see why El Grande would be a big deal. Granted, it's area control. I know. But they are better games. El Grande felt to me, and I think Mark J. validated this for me, like it was all about being in 2nd place, and about timing.

That's SO over now as a mechanic. It was cool for a few years in the late 1990's. No one does this anymore.

TRY July/05: Well, this is pretty good!  I like the multi-purpose bids & the variability of the actions available.  Lots of good little things. I didn't expect to enjoy it this much, frankly, as I'm not a big fan of Kramer's other offerings.  I find that he makes solid games, but not ones I'm eager to replay; many are action-point types, and I don't seem to be thrilled by those.  But this is not one of those, and it is very good.  

OWN July/06.  Some of the action cards seem to be missing some text -- incomplete sentences (determinable from the rules).

A bit too samey.

I like area scoring as a mechanic among others in a game. But El Grande has nothing else to offer. Granted - the action cards brings some variety, but in practice they have a lesser impact on the game than I first excpected.

I know EG was first to explore area majority in this way. But this mechanic is certainly no novelty these days and El Grande just feels a bit dated.

Pros:
Easy to pick up. Rulewise its much easier than the weight on BGG suggest. Gameplay could be challanging though, it should be able to give AP-prone players head ace calculating optimal moves.

The Castillo and the secret discs are really cool!

Love the crude old school-euro artwork.

Verdict: I like it better when area scoring is just one scoring element among others in a game (AOEIII, Rise of Empires, Struggle of empires...). Manhattan is vaguely reminiscent to El Grande and is also only about majority, but the former is brisker, meaner and plays much faster.

A top classic area control game over Spain.  The rules were easy to follow and I liked the player interaction.  There are a lot of tough decisions what to do based on other players and outthinking yourself.

Really love this game. A very elegant design, it's much more tactical than strategical (although some kind of medium term strategy is not absent) thus allowing for a lot of creativity in the game play.

I feel only one thing while playing this game: hatred
...towards the game.

I hate the downtime, when you have to wait scratching your hair, unable to plan anything because the other players' choices will affect you so greatly. 
The game art looks rather depressing and just guess who had to sit behind of THE GREAT CASTILLO (or what was its name..) trying to see the game board over it.
And that Castillo scoring? Idiotic factor, bad idea forged into a worthless game component.

A game totally worth its rating! I won't give 1 since I'm pretty hopeful that there is something worse than this game.

Edit: Nothing worse found after over 300 different games played. This is an achievement of a sort. :)

My first try at this game felt a little 'meh'.  My opinion may be influenced by the fact that one player was overthinking all of his decisions which kind of bogged the game down.

I am more than willing to give this classic another shot and see if my opinion improves.

El Grande is the definitive area majority game, it is a really fun game, simple mechanics but great depth, it's been more than 20 years and it is still exciting. 

The Tower concept is soooo good, you have to be really concentrated to remember how many players the other player have in there, but then the game happens, and you have to pick a card with a number... "OH SH*T! that number made me forget how many meeples did the other guy put inside the tower... how many did I have?"

It is an amazing game.

Only complaint I have is that the big box isn't neccesary, I get it, it's called El Grande, but that makes it more difficult to bring to other houses to play.

I feel this one would still be exciting in 20 more years

My favorite of the (very long long) moment. Lots of opportunities for tactical plays.  Very little luck, lots of opportunities for defensive/offensive play and short/long-term strategies.

After several years I still love this game; plays different every time.  Elegant brilliance.  And a beautiful game board.

This game was a big surprise to me. It has clear rules and gameplay, but there are some nice decisions going on and decent bits of strategy. It's strategic, yet rarely paralyzing or slow. Expansions might reinvigorate the game, but out of the box, it's a good play. I thought it might be a little rusty, due to its age, but the game is smoothly designed with only a few trips to the rulebook for clarification. And that's usually the hallmark of a polished game.

This game is all out in the open. If you have some up-for-a-challenge non-gamer friends they will be fine too. Sure, you are just moving wooden cubes around, but with 4 or 5 people this game offers many opportunties for thought. Largely tactical--things change quickly, but you better have a plan leading up to and during the rounds before scoring occurs. More importantly, you better have a contingency.

Push wooden cubes around until someone falls behind, then chooses who they want to win.  Some clever elements that are drowned out in the repetative cube placing and far, far too much kingmaking.  Make sure you're popular with your group before you play! :p

UPDATE:  I've played a game and I'm dyin to play more.  I really like this one... can't put my finger on why just yet.  There's a lot of secret actions here, like throwing your cabs into the castle, or using the little disk to select things.. lots of good choices, too.  I like a lot of what this game has to offer, so I'll be toting it around too.  By the by, I'm really really glad that I picked up the Hans im Gluck publication of the first version.  I wish HiG produced all of my games!

El Grande is almost perfect. The auction system takes care of the luck factor with card drawing in a way that adds an additional layer of strategy. Managing of your hand, court, and provinces ensures a constant struggle that provides for a great table wide feeling of tension throughout the game. Every game has a different flavor depending on how players play their auction cards. Downtime is minimal because someone is always picking up ground in one of your provinces forcing you to think how to counter. It does experience the kingmaker problem at times and I suggest making rules beforehand to deal with it.

Great design. Gets better with more players. I do feel that it's somewhat overrated. Often it's just a bunch of players simply trying to put as many cubes as possible on the board, and there is no real strategy, nor many clever tactical moves.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I believe this game really needs 5 players to at least provide tense competition of resources. But the problems start. Firstly to play well you need to know the other 44 action cards to at least make an informed decision as to evaluate effectively which power card to play. Not only that, you need to number crunch what the displayed cards are worth for the other players. So the pace is affected, with text on the action cards slowing it some more. Then once you executed your move, it's a waiting game as really you have nothing to plan as you really can't anticipate what the next four action cards to be displayed will be. All that mental exercise just to have your cabelleros moved by someones action card. When it comes to scoring, the highlight is dialling up to deploy your cabelleros from the castillo to the dialled region. Then it's the longwinded scoring of majorities. Unless you love number crunching, it's quite a dull experience.

Only played once but loved it despite finishing last. Area control, so lots of player interaction. Made one huge mistake setting my province dial to the one with the King in it when I had 6 cubes in the castillo and all were returned to my court! Hilarious. Love the power cards...they provide lots of tough decisions. It seemed like the whole game was a series of decisions about what to do with very limited resources. Dangerous if you have several AP-prone players in your group. Would not play with less than 4.

As much fun to play as Risk but has more strategy.  Almost a mini wargame.  Strategies may not be obvious the first few plays.  This game has grown on me as I did not even care for it the first 2 times I played. The game seemed too chaotic; the strategies are subtle. Every move of every turn is critical. An excellent game.

My rating for El Grande has increased after every play. This game is definitely the definiton of elegance. THE best area majority game I have played.  

With several sessions under my belt, I still feel this is an elegant design and great as an introduction to area majority games. Will play when time is limited; however, if time allows, Dominant Species trumps this game on all accounts.

RATING: 7
This was one of the big Euros that I felt I had to try when getting into the hobby (just after Carcassonne, Settlers, Puerto Rico and Power Grid), but I never quite warmed to it. It gets props as the first of many Euro cubes-on-a-map area-control games (correct me if I'm wrong) but I prefer several of the games that have followed and refined that mechanic: San Marco, King of Siam, Tammany Hall for example. 

I think that's mainly down to the lack of constraints in El Grande. The King provides some limitation on what you can do on your turn, but there are so many special powers coming into play that it's almost impossible to predict what other players will do. This means the game tends towards the meta (bash the leader etc.) rather than mechanics-driven. Another factor is chaos: so much can happen between your turns that it feels almost entirely tactical, aside from the rather obvious hand management around playing your bidding cards. I do think the Castillo is a fantastic game component though.

One of the best majority driven game out there. The material is superb. The mechanic and rules are realy easy so the game can be teached and understood rapidly. A game for four our five player. Under that the fight for majorities won't be chalanging enough.

Un des meilleurs jeux de majorité sur le marché. Le matériel est superbe. La méchanique ainsi que les règlements sont simples ce qui fait qu'il peut être enseigné et compris en un rien de temps. Ce jeu est surtout fait pour des parties à quatre ou cinq joueurs. En bas de ce nombre, les combats pour les majorités seront beaucoups moins intéressants.

RATING: 9
There are nine turns in a game of El Grande.  The player with the most points wins.  A round of turns consists of players bidding cards for the right to go first.  Low number cards allow players to ready more Caballeros to place on the board.  Then, in turn order, players choose one of five action cards.  The weaker actions allow more Caballeros to actually be placed on the board.  Every three turns a scoring round takes place.  Players get points based on how many Caballeros they have in the various regions of Spain relative to the other players.

There's some interesting elements that take this superficially dry approach and inject it full of excitment and fun.  For example Caballeros can be placed into the Castillo and then players can secretly deploy them just prior to scoring.  The available action cards vary from turn to turn and from game to game making each game different.  The timing of when to take control of the king and how to funnel your Caballeros onto the the board is also a fun consideration.  The more I play this game the more I like it.  There's plenty of tactical manouvering.  Additionally there's bluffing and second guessing your opponents.  I find more and more that games that require me to predict what my opponents will do provide the best kind of player interaction paricularly if they require players to form short term alliances.  El Grande has these qualities.  

Certain regions provide many more points than others yet fighting too hard over the point-rich regions can cost you in the long run.  Competition is fierce and back stabbing opprotunities abound.

At first the action cards seemed fiddly, but now we make sure to explain them clearly at the beginning of each round if there are any new players.  I find it important to focus on "short term" strategy, i.e. make a plan for the next three turns.  Long term strategy comes in to play with how you ration your bidding cards and route Caballeros to the board.

I should probably note that we always play the variant were turn order is determined from high power card to low power card rather than in clock-wise order from the highest power card.

RATING: 6.5
A reasonable game, but I don't see the fascination that makes people think it's so special.  As far as complex decisions, it's pretty good, unfortunately the turn structure causes a lot of waiting while other players make their decisions, none of which can be made in advance as everything depends on what the previous player did.  Also, the 'theme' didn't fit the manipulation required by the game mechanics -- no wonder there are no session reports for this game.  I have played so many better games than this recently, I doubt I'll have time to come back to it, but I might.

Gran bel gioco! Uno dei più belli di sempre. Molto profondo e intelligente. Il più vecchio e, secondo me, ancora imbattuto campione delle maggioranze. Facile da spiegare e con assenza quasi totale del fattore fortuna ma è utile un po’ di memoria. L'ambientazione è fasulla (cavalieri rappresentati da cubetti improbabili), ma il materiale piace comunque (la torre è fantastica e il tabellone ha un non so che di intrigante). L'interazione è molto alta. Si fanno parecchie bastardate, le proprie scelte dipendono SEMPRE dal comportamento altrui e viceversa. Spiel des Jahres... 1996.

I do enjoy this game, and I appreciate the many innovative mechanics it employs. I can certainly see why this ranks as a 10 for many others. It slips a little for me for two reasons: it's really best with exactly 5 players, and I seem incapable of ever coming close to winning this game.

Light, area control game that plays as challenging as ones opponents skill with a very small amount of luck.

I have only played the base game and not any of the other additions/variants that come with the decennial edition.

RATING: 8.5
I finally got to play this at BGG Con '08 and I loved it!  It wasn't nearly as complicated as I thought it might be and I was on the edge of my seat pretty much the entire time.  

My only (two) complaint was the card that got rid of everyones pool of available guys to place, which slowed things down considerably and the inherent value of being the last person to bid isn't really balanced out or accounted for in any way.  What I mean is, when you are last to bid, it isn't through really any effort on your part, but you have the advantage of full bidding knowledge.  It was often the last bidder who got the highest bid when there wasn't a "grab" for the high bid, and so they would get to place the king for a bid of like 7.

Anyways, that being said, I really loved the game, it felt like a really tight, good design.

I've finally gotten a chance to play this game with five players and I may not play it any other way.  I enjoy the decisions and the balance of getting caballeros to the court and to the board.  With five players, the decisions are a lot tighter and knowing that each action card might get used each turn makes for great game conditions.  With five ready players, this game is probably an 8 for me, I'll suggest it.  I've gotten a chance to play it with three, and it confirms my preference for five.

This is the original game. Now included with all expansions so far (2016) stuffed in to one big box. 

Rules are quite simple each round you bid for player order. In your turn you move some caballero's on the board and execute a special action that almost always interfere's with the plans of the other players. In this way you try to get majorities is as much regions as possible to score points.

Lots of player interaction which makes detailed planning ahead impossible, in stead try to keep as much options open.

El Grande é mesmo grande, um jogo de sociedade em que tudo foi pensado para torná-lo um icone entre os apreciadores.

Bom para jogar de vez em quando, quando apetece muito muito, fora isso, há outras opções...

Just played my second game, looking forward to playing this one again real soon.  I guess you can't call the number 9  (now 21) ranked game a forgotten classic, but no-one seems to be talking about El Grande anymore.  The cult-of-the-new has catapulted a number of games ahead of El Grande in the rankings but I don't see many of them standing the test of time.  Lots of great play without too much noise.

I'm sure this game by the numbers is a balanced game but when it comes down to it, it's just not fun for me.  Great game if you want to analyze but hits a chess mode by the second scoring round with constant analysis and down time which just makes it not fun.  Going through the last third of the game I just wanted it to end no matter who ended up winning (i was in the lead). San Marco scratches the same area control itch but for me is much more enjoyable.

The theme of El Grande is scrambling over others.  The decisions are almost always of the flavor of, "if I do this, I get
lots of points!  Also, that really sticks it to Player X."  Sometimes it's the other way around.  What makes El Grande so neat is that it's able to take this wonderful theme and find many of its variations--you can stick it to others through analysis, through careful management, through rotten luck, and through psychological wiliness.  What other game do you hear people saying "Noooooooooooo...don't do that..." for
so many reasons?  It's not the fairest game, but it's a game with a distinct flavor that I find delicious.

Beautiful pieces make up this game, and it's not a half-bad intro to strategy Euro-games.  Unfortunately, the better you are at this one, the longer it will run on.

If you play this game with a table full of advanced gamers, it may very well devolve into an endless round of "This move gives me +2, this move nets me -1" analysis, and the theme will be forgotten.  (See Elfenland.)

One of the best area influence games I have ever had the pleasure to play. An excellent balance point of cutthroat behavior with caution and group dynamics. Turn order, resource management and bidding each present in a streamlined and easy-to-understand way.

01-03-2015. Rated after 2 plays. Granddad of the area-control genre I think, in which you score points based on how many guys you have in a certain area of Spain. Areas award several players a fixed amount of VPs based on how many dudes each player has in the area. In addition, you have the Castillo. Its a special location that gives VPs, but in addition allows you to place the guys you put into the Castillo into another region in order to get VPs from that region also. 

Each turn you choose a card with a placement number and a number of cubes you get from the supply. Then you can choose one of the action cards, that and get a number of guys to place based on that card from your supply to your board and give you a special scoring or special ability. The last player may play the first card in the next round. There are 3 scoring rounds in the game.

Game is a bit too simple for my tastes.. but certainly no bad game. I do wonder if it's still as exceptionally good as some people made it out to be (once). Might be replaced by small world (for many people?), since SW adds variable player powers - well race powers-. I think I like this game better than SW personally, since SW really doesn't have more than area control.

I am beginning to like area control games a lot. So I figured I should trade for this without having played it since it is well received and area control.

Enjoyed the game a lot even though we made some mistakes with the rules in our first play.

I swear every game that I play where someone (myself included) is teaching it based off of reading the rules and never having played it we always make at least one mistake with the rules.

In any case, the game still went very smoothly and everyone seemed to enjoy it. I can't wait to play again. I think I'll play it once more with the base game and then add the expansions.

Certainly a classic that is deserving of all the praise it receives. The Grandfather of all area control with some variable turn order. Tons of depth and re-playability to be found here. Unfortunately, my first game was a bit miserable due to a certain card, unbeknownst to me, that wiped my court. Had to learn the hard way that playing two low power cards back to back can be a big gamble. Spent the rest of the game floundering in last place trying to counteract the effect of that nasty card. Most people would write off a game that can do a player in by turn 2 or 3, but I see the brilliance within, and I look forward to giving this game another attempt.

Best area control game I've played so far.  Game mechanics of the king and castillo are truly special.

I'm not a fan of some of the card choices, like the veto card for example, and I think the rules should say those who played the lowest power card goes 1st next round, then 2nd lowest goes 2nd and so on (instead of clockwise order from lowest power card played) but I just deal with the veto cards and can easily make a house rule change.

Has that "classic" feel to it.

--Jan2005-- Played enough now to realize I really like this game!  First couple times the volume of data was overwhelming, and I succumbed to an unfortunate degree of analysis paralysis.  But it seems now that one really needs to approach the game as a downhill skiier:  go for it with confidence; one might crash and burn, but it'll be a whole lot more fun than approaching the experience timidly.

--Mar2009-- And, for what little it's worth, the power cards from King&Intrigue are in my opinion an improvement.

When it comes to true Euro-games, I don't think there is a finer area-control title out there.  The game has never been static for me.  I always seem to be defending my lead or trying to claw at the distance between me and the leader.  I suppose there is a bit of 'bash-the-leader,' but I feel that hidding your moves and ambushing your opponents is integral to the game.I have often wonder if El Grande wouldn't have made a better Game of Thrones title.

Beautiful game - elegant, lots of options, lots of different strategies, and once players learn the action cards, it plays quickly.  Hard with new players, though, since they get demolished pretty badly the first few games :)

RATING: 7
Good gateway area control game. Clean design with a lot of variability. Fairly tactical. Each round, new cards come out but you can only choose one and you give your opponents the other actions. Gives the game that slight feeling of disaster mitigation as you have to determine you least worry about your opponents having control of.

There are a lot of decisions to be made every turn; but I never feel particularly engaged by the game. I agree with everyone that the game plays smoothly - but it doesn't satisfy my itch as a strategy game as much as I would have liked.

Another classic work, area control. El Grande is about the aristocracy in Spain in the 15th Century. This game contains a lot of strategies, relying on your hand management, card selection, and even diplomacy. Two things I do not like this otherwise excellent game: memorizing the Castillo and starting your shameless diplomatic negotiation. I believe there are many treasures to dig out of this game, other than the treasurous Rule of Two and Rule of Three (two very universial Golden Rules applicable to almost every game).

With 5 players, this is one of my favorite game ever and it is great with 4 as well. I just really enjoy playing it. There are so many things to consider. When to bid high, low, where to put guys, which cards are most beneficial to who, etc. Always filled with angst as I want to do so many things. A great game, especially considering that it was one of the first Euro games I owned and remains one of my favorite.

One of my favorite games.  The game seems to have a good balance of strategic and tactical play, something difficult to achieve.  There is also a tension created by the need to stop other players from scoring while at the same time trying to maximize your own score.  Difficult to do both setting up that tension.

For a Euro-game, this one is surprisingly chaotic and cut-throat. I love the way all the mechanics fit so perfectly together into a good solid strategy game. The only disappointment is the extreme level of abstraction. Even so, this is one of the best games to come out of Germany.

THE classic area control game! And even after more plays it will stay challenging and suspenseful. A downright keeper, that fortunately you can find again and again on German flea markets for next to nothing. Even without expansions an excellent game.

EDIT: Nomore in my collection since Essen 2013 no-shipping-mathtrade.

EDIT 2: Ok, this game always slides into my collection again. I guess I traded or sold it around four times now and always got it back.

EDIT 3: And again: traded it for "Eminent Domain" and got it directly back the next weekend.

EDIT 4: The never ending story continues: in the meantime I bought it two times at the fleamarket and traded it once for "Loopin' Louie".

Of all the highly-rated Euros I've played, this is the one that I just don't get (Tigris and Euphrates used to rival it, before I discovered how well it plays with two - I still don't get its popularity as a three or four player game).

Based on two plays (I won both): very interesting and complex game, though I can't help but compare it to San Marco, which I played first. I really like San Marco's divide/choose mechanism, which seems to add an element of tension that I did not find in the bidding-for-turn-order aspect of El Grande. But el Grande has a lot going on - you have to balance offensive and defensive moves, and must decide when it's best to go first, and when it's best to go last. I think that balancing all those aspects is the key to winning this game - and that, to me, makes a game enjoyable and re-playable.

Can drag with slow players - not more than a 75 minute game.

A very original design when it went out, it is the father of many games as [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/1041]San Marco[/url][/i], [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/18258]Mission: Red Planet[/url][/i] and [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/12477]Bootleggers[/url][/i], among others that share the majority mechanic.  It is one of the best of Kramer's games and the probably the best of Ulrich's.  Nevertheless I normally don't like much their designs, with [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/93]El Grande[/url][/i] they did a good job.

RATING: 4
The paradigm of area-of-control, players bid for player order to place "caballeros" in various areas of Spain, which grant you points if you have more in any given region.  Higher bid=less pieces to control, but better chance at choosing the action you need or want to prevent.  The game relies on careful timing, since scoring is pre-determined at certain intervals.  This game has simple rules, almost to a fault, but don't be fooled; the strategy of what action to select is quite deep.  It's best for at least 4, and preferably 5, players.  Anything less gives little incentive to bid high, since there are many options per player to fall back on.

First off, this is a game that should be played only with 5 people. Even with 4, I did not like the uncertainty of having one of the cards go unused.

The mechanics of this game are quite clever, and it is one of my favorite area control games, which is not one of my favorite genres.

Doing well in this seems to require two elements: knowing when to fight for big points, and finding small, persistent points that won't attract too much notice. In that respect, I think some of the short-term gain, long term goal decisions at the begging of the game can be quite interesting.

And, the castle is just cool!

Somebody is trying to get at the gold, or increase their share! Furthermore, who is the man in the green hat and why do I keep seeing my dead brother Johnny in crowds and at street corners?

RATING: 5
Simple and elegant rules, layered strategy, tough decisions. Undoubtedly the best, cleanest area-majority game out there, and lesson 101 on elegant game design. Player scaling is a concern, as anything other than 4-5 players poses a problem.

-------------

Wasn't as fun for my 2nd play, as I was out of the 5-player game after the 2nd scoring, and spent the last 3 rounds contemplating last place. That's almost an hour of boredom, folks. Downside for such a strict player complement.

-------------

Further lowered rating from 8.5 to 8. The decisions are interesting, but there's a lot of player chaos. This is one of those evergreen games which, if released today, wouldn't sniff the BGG Top 20. Surpassed by majority games that have differentiated pieces and clever rules that relax the leader while incentivizing the losers.

3+2

Excellent game that is thoroughly deserving of its high rank.  Built-in catchup mechanic as everyone gangs up on the leaders at the end, but I'm not sure if this makes it essentially a game of kingmaker.  Would be a 9 if not for this and a little bit of the dryness and may still go up to a 9 with additional play.  We'll see.  Do NOT underestimate the importance of the Castillo!  The cards allow for variance from game to game, but I would have liked to see more variety in the cards, but I suppose there is only so much one can do.  Lots to love about this one.  Perfect 5-player game.

After playing this a couple more times, it has confirmed my opinion that this becomes a game of kingmaker with the trailing players helping to determine the winner.  I don't really like that and this game really only becomes playable for me if we need something for 5 players.  The theme (or lack thereof) is bland and the gameplay just gets dryer with additional plays.  This game immediately goes into the For Trade pile for me.

I realized that I never corrected my rating for this steaming pile of crap.

El Grande -- A must for any eurogame collection.  So much has been written about this one, I feel I have nothing new to add.

Of note:  In his geeklist titled, "Theme changed by the publisher", Bruno Faidutti mentions that the original theme for this game was the Trojan War.  The Castillo was the Trojan Horse!  Yes, it's not a war game.  And yes, the Trojan Horse didn't hold troops from multiple factions.  But it's still an interesting take.

RATING: 3
1 plays, both 4 players.

first play 
-----
People say it's dry and I would disagree with that, instead I would say it's opaque and contraintuitive:
1. Adjacency of two areas is mostly unimportant. Your units enter the map regardless to where your other units are (but next to the king, which I don't get) . 
2. Bidding for turn order. I find it so unnecessary, did all old euros had this? This might be part of calling El Grande dry (Khorne goes first because He Is The Blood God, now shutup!). 
3. The action cards. You simply have to memorize as they don't have any obvious sense (theme wise) beside making the game replayable while making it all about short term tactics. 
4. Kramer's action point system in a completely tactical game = downtime, downtime and AP.

Second game
--------
Showed that knowing which cards are in the deck is truly important. Contraintuitivess matters less, but still, owning Chaos in the Old World I see no reason why I would play this if given the choice between the two. 

I found Torres much better for somewhat similar style game (No turn order nonsense, cards are simpler and the spacial relations make much more sense making the whole thing is more intuitive to grasp).

Despues de las primeras partidas, no me arrepiento nada de haberlo comprado. Me ha encantado y ya tengo ganas de volver a jugar.
Me parece al mejor juego de mayorias que he probado, junto con el Rajá.
Aun no he probado las expansiones que vienen, pero parecen que complican demasiado el juego, y tienen bastante dependencia del idioma.

all right, this is the only 10 i have given to any game, so i ought to be able to explain myself.

this game has everything i look for in a game:  tough decisions, player interaction, back-stabbing, frustration and beautiful components.  all that in two hours or less...

my most memorable game was a 4-player in which we had a 3-way tie with the 4th player 5 points behind! talk about a nail-biter!

besides that, i have never been tempted to fiddle with the rules, not even a little bit!  it's the only game i can think of that i haven't.

I was looking for a good game that is confrontational and this game delivered well.
At every move, you can screw someone over and while you are being screwed over, you can still say, "Wow that was a good move."
It is simple to understand yet has great strategic depth. An excellent game with very little luck involved. When you win, you really feel you have accomplished something great.
A definite keeper.

RATING: 6.5
Played once with 5P. El Grande is a pure area control game, and naturally has a good deal of in-built conflict. This is one of those games where deep thought is required to perform well, at the expense of playing time. My one game lasted close to 3 hours, which made me a tad restless. As with most area control games, players need to constantly think ahead of their opponents and know when to assert dominance or consolidate their losses. That said, area control isn't one of my favourite mechanisms. In terms of similar games, I prefer San Marco for its quicker playing time and 'pie-rule' mechanism.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I only played the base game, no expansions.  I enjoyed the bidding mechanic much more than I thought , as it's not a true 'auction' game.  There's a good deal of chaos to the game, but not a lot of luck.  Downtime is kept to a minimum and you can plot out strategies while not playing

Area control. Great game that is simple to understand and can be enjoyed immediately. There is depth to the game that allows you to continuously refine your strategy. Dropping cabelleros into the castillo is a fun mechanic. Playing the shorter variant (6 turns instead of 9) falls a little flat. Some people may think the large wooden pawn representing the king looks like a big turd.  Do not let these people squirt the king piece out of their hand because you won't get the image out of your mind for the rest of the game.

RATING: 10
[15 plays] My only 3 player game has revealed that much of the tension evaporates with less than 4 or 5 players.

El Grande is epic. This game hits all the right notes for me. The tactical decisions are numerous but not paralyzing. Messing with your opponents is expected behavior and very fun. Pursuing a grand strategy isn't really possible, but it seems like I always attempt something in the beginning. There are so many opportunities for clever moves throughout, and the games usually end up tense right to the finish. 

The yin-yang card mechanics are a clever way to make sure player's balance their play for the long and short term. The Castillo Tower adds a another nifty element of memory and psychology to the game. I like the bits, the art, and while the theme isn't deep at all - fighting for majority control of the areas is instinctively understood and fun for most people.

"Experts" will tell you that it is best not to be a leader and be targeted, that it is better to hang back and try to slingshot at the end. I disagree, and I will take scoring opportunities as early and often as I can. I have done well playing boldly from the lead.

Most recent play Aug '15.

This game is THE classic typical euro game. Tough and limited decisions and resources. Long term strategy and short term decisions making combine in one VERY intense game experience.

Ranks head and shoulders above E&T and the best of them. Yes, the theme is a little cold but the current 21st century lineage of German/Euro gaming can be traced back to this game.

I really enjoy playing this game with the maximum amount of players. It can be quite a battle to control different territories. The secrecy of the castillo, the power card decisions, the newly introduced turn order factor, and the action card options all make for superb and unique playing. It is suprisingly light, but heartily strategic.

Area Control, Resource Management. Wish I got to play this more. I like area control games and I love this with 5 people so the competition for the action cards is tight. Update: played this 3p after a long hiatus since last play. Although the competition for action cards isn't as tight, it is actually a nicely fast-moving strategy game with just 3. I think I'd bump this up a notch if we played it more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Why not higher? I don't know - this game, despite its elegance, just doesn't grab me with the "fever". I think it is incredibly designed and nicely produced. El Grande is an interesting game, but not a particularly fun or fascinating one. I realize El Grande is this landmark game, and is considered by many to be the premier area majority game. And I can see its historical place in the records of game development. But I do not find it that compelling. I like the mechanics - the crucial role of bidding for turn order and so on. But I think El Grande only really shines with five, and when we have five players, we usually play a lighter game, or a meatier game. Which leaves El Grande gathering dust.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Sure there are tense moments, but I like conflict in a game and there is a difference between the competitiveness in these games and conflict. I guess I am a wargamer at heart

A területfoglalós játékok őse. 1995-ös játék, ami tényleg megállja a helyét a mai játékok között, sőt, szabályának egyszerűsége, a könnyű játékmenete igazán kellemes játékká teszi a spanyolföldön játszódó társast. A 9 területen kell többséget elérnünk, ahova lerakást egy választott akciókártyával tehetjük meg, amin még egy plusz akció is szerepel, amivel további csoportosításokat, speciális értékeléseket tehetünk meg. A játék legizgalmasabb része a torony, amibe láthatatlanul gyűlnek a játékosok kockái és minden értékelés előtt egy titkokban választott tartományra kerülhetnek fel, amivel megbolondíthatják az addig jól számolt stratégiákat. Az El Grandéban elsőre két "hibát" találtam. Egyrészt nagyon gondolkodós lehet egy-egy köre egy játékosnak, másrészt erre a játékra tényleg igaz, hogy fix játékosszámmal igazán élvezetes. Négy játékos esetén még csak-csak, de hárman biztos nem ülnék le hozzá. Egyértelműen öten jön ki a játék igazi nagysága. A játék jó, de számomra nem kiemelkedő a mai jó játékok körében. 95-ben biztos eggyel vagy akár két ponttal is többet adtam volna neki, de most egy erős 7-es jár az El Grandénak.

[2011-08-27]
Sikerült kipróbálnom öten és egyértelműen jobb élményt kaptam. Ez a játék tényleg 5 személyre van kitalálva. A játék szép kivitelezése, a szabályok egyszerűsége és az izgalmas játékmenet megérdemelné a 8 pontot, de valahogy még mindig nem érzem, hogy megfogna a játék és egyre újabb partikat követelnék.

[2012-05-26]
A pontszám nem nő, mert ahogy éreztem hárman katasztrófa. Még öten is van benne rendesen királycsinálási lehetőség, de hárman csak arról szól. Négyen már élvezhető, de mint korábban írtam nagyon ajánlott csak öten leülni hozzá.

This is an outstanding game that I couldn't wait to play again (but had to wait two years). Easy to teach, but with great tactical depth. I own the Decennial reprint, and I must confess that I'm disappointed by the quality of some of the components. The cardboard stock is thinner than comparable games. The card stock and texture leads me to believe that they will not hold up well after several plays. Several of the cards have serious text misprints. This box also calls out for a decent insert, or maybe some tuckboxes for the cards.

RATING: 10
This may be my favorite game.  EG is a very dynamic (read: high interaction) area control game.  There are nine regions on a board representing medieval Spain.  At three scheduled points, majorities are assessed in each region.  A majority is achieved by having the most markers (cabelleros) in the region.  The regions have different point values, and some reward second and third place as well.  There is also a region called the Castillo, which is a tower into which cabelleros can be dropped and be hidden.  The castillo is scored first, and any cabelleros in the tower are distributed back onto the board upon scoring by a simultaneous reveal mechanic.  

El Grande is a great social game that can be played at some depth, or intuitively:  really serious players know the card stacks very well and anticipate certain cards, while I enjoy the mostly tactical challenge of dealing with whatever comes up that round. 

Only good with 4 or 5.  Best with 5.

Truly enjoyable area-control game.  The auction system sets up your actions, and the Castellano is a nice touch that provides wild-card possibilities.

UPDATE: After many plays of many games, I can say that this simply is THE area control game. It's a classic, and I don't think anything will ever truly surpass it in this genre.

Great game! A classic. Fantastic area majority game that has stood the test of time (SdJ 1996). A true classic! The grand-daddy of area majority. I am glad to have a copy in my collection. The downsides: some HTI (cards played and the castello) and a cosmetic one: the VP track has no numbers printed on, the fields all look the same.)

Not really good with 2.

An excellent game that has become a modern classic. It features a bunch of great mechanics: bid for turn order, draft cards that determine your actions, and score points via area control. The expansions shake it up a bit, in a good way.

Gateway rating: 8

Update: Upgrading my overall rating to a 9. This is a quality board game that has stood the test of time. It's hard to think of another game that brings together elegant gameplay mechanisms, player interaction, and tactical balance as well as El Grande does.

I love this game, and so does my family.  Some of my family are not fleet enough of thought to really embrace games like Puerto Rico, and Settlers, but everyone understands this game, and picks up the subtleties quickly.  The options available the round before the scoring round is incredibly tense, and fun.

The game can be a bit combative, and the last time we played, my mom won three times...and she was working on her third glass of wine at the time, as well.  This would score a perfect 10 if I had a better feeling for the strategy of the game.  The fact that my mom seems to do so well, when her strategy is virtually non-existent cause me to worry about the integrity of the game, however the groups I play with, especially my family is so concerned about me winning a game, sometimes people like my mother are able to establish a huge lead which is challenging, but not difficult to recover from.  All in all, a great game with high quality pieces and tonnes of replayability.

I don't necessarily love the strategy in this game more than Puerto Rico or Tigris and Euphrates or Caylus, but I love that I can play it with almost any group or completely new people, and the new people can feel like they have an idea of what to do more than they would in any of those games.  Or maybe I really do just like this game better.

After game 1:

Caveat - we played only 4 turns with 2 scoring rounds, so its not even a full game.

Interesting game. Definitely needs more game time. I think it is over-hyped though, or maybe I just expected more.

The game is very mathematic, in the sense that scoring is the essence of the game - every move is a min-maxing calculation of 'where would I get a slightly better score'.

I won the first game but I am not sure it its something I did...

I'm always up for a game of El Grande!  The mechanics are great:  using the cards to determine turn order and the number of caballeros to add to your court, the placement of caballeros, the castillo.  An extremely well-designed, original game concept.  You can see its influence in many games.   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I actually like this game a good deal more than what is usually considered its big brother for gamers: Dominant Species.  While vanilla El Grande is a bit simpler than I tend to like, Dominant Species just felt overly convoluted.  And El Grande being simple makes it a great game for beginners.  There is also a good amount of strategy hidden behind that simplicity making it a very good game for anybody really.  I just don't think its deep enough to have the lifespan of more varied and dynamic games.

I will also warn that the game is best with larger player numbers (4-5) because fewer takes away a lot of the tension that gives this game its strategic chops.  I've played once so far with just 3 and even going last that player has 3 choices of action cards.  With 4 and especially with 5 play order plays a much bigger role in the game and playing the power cards becomes much more exciting, almost like its own mini-game with "Price is Right" style tricks.

French Edition. Descartes Editeur. Easy to understand, strategic enough, excellent mechanics, nice historic context and not too long. Every game is a different game. Very elegant.

After all this years this game didn't survive very well in my will to play it. I confess that I'm not too much excited in playing it again in any time soon but I still respect the way this game changed and molded my way to see games, especially euros. El Grande is one of the first euros that introduced some new and fresh mechanics that I still love. But then again, the lack of theme makes me don't like it that much after all these years.

RATING: 8
The popularity of this game tells me that all you Eurogamers are just ATers at heart!  "El Grande" is certainly a conflict-heavy Eurogame, so don't play it with people whose feelings get hurt easily.  In fact, I'd say that it almost has an uncomfortably high screwage factor for a Euro (especially if you're playing with some people that you don't know very well!).  But overall, my impressions after a single play are very positive.  This game is all about player interaction (which likely means that fewer players will decrease the fun factor - we played with 5), and there is no shortage of tension and anticipation.  As a result, a bit of diplomacy even tends to come into play!  Apparently I played the 10th anniversary edition, and I found all the bits to be functional, with a couple that certainly stood out over the others.  The board is large, uncrowded, and pleasing to the eye.  Unfortunately, the game doesn't come with dozens of plastic Spanish soldiers (as my buddy stated, perhaps they're saving that for the 20th anniversary edition!), but the wooden bits work nicely.  I really don't have much that's negative to say after our 5-player game, so I'll just leave it at that!  And you all should be proud of me - I managed to get through that without a single comment about large, black, phallic bits...  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 3.5/5  Total: 8/10

I'm not sure what to think of this game.  On the one hand the rules are simple and the play time is just about right with very little down time.  It is rich in tactics but, unfortunately seems to have ZERO long-term strategy.  I say this because the board changes so quickly that tyring to make long-term plans is impossible.  I love tactical games as much as anybody but I didn't feel like I had much control over things at ALL even with bidding on turn order.  The game came down to a simple procedure of bid based on what my gut told me, hope that card is still there when I take my turn, then just try to maximize my point gain with whichever cards are left on my turn.  In other words, despite the fact I won my first game I didn't derive much satisfaction from it because I thought a lot of it didn't have much to do with me at all.  Maybe I just need to try this game some more because I DO understand why some people like it a lot.

Area control game.
Difficult choices each round to make it sure you can't alway make the best move. Your progress in the game is going to be influenced by other players, so it is good to have a low profile/don't be a target for many players (ie try not to lead in score with a big difference in the early game)

[3 plays]  It is hard for me to decide exactly how to rate this game.  I find the design of the game clever and interesting.  The games I have played have been tight and hard fought.  Definately has a good amount of thinking which I like.  But it seems like both times I have played the ending of the game was odd and anti-climatic.  Like king-making/ganging up on the leader or some twist at the end that just sort of took the wind of the sails.  Maybe it has just been flukes but it has been enough to keep this game from being requested that often over other Euro-games in my gaming group.  I am curious to try this one more though, I would try it a few more times, learn the strategy a bit better, get a better handle for how to bid in the auctions, which cards to try for, etc.  Also hopefully to see get a better handle on the end of game deal.

RATING: 6.5
Another game I'll have to play a couple more times to solidify my feelings.  I'm not very good at area-control games, in general.  But while I wasn't impressed with this at first, in retrospect I find that there are some nice mechanics going on here, it doesn't feel too heavy, and it ends in a fairly reasonable length of time.

The tower of hidden cubes adds a nice memory/press-your-luck component, as well as a last minute element of change before scoring that keeps scoring rounds more tense.  The hidden-location rondels for each player allow for simultaneous secret actions in a concise (if slightly gimmicky) manner.  The special action cards allow for some good interaction and screw-your-neighbor plays.  I'm not a giant fan of the cube-farming mechanic (moving cubes from the provinces to your court), but it isn't nearly as omnipresent and annoying as it is in Notre Dame, so I'll let that slide.

I'd definitely play a couple more times, though it's not at the top of my to-do list.  Maybe I'm just a sucker for cube-towers.

COLORBLINDNESS NOTE: Oh jeez, the green and brown cubes are nigh indistinguishable.  WHY NOT BLACK AS A COLOR?  SHEESH.  So, yeah, this caused some issues in putting cubes in areas where I thought there was one other person with a lot of brown cubes when, in fact, the green and brown players were both there.  Careful with this if you have color impairment!

A terrific combination of mechanics that allows for tactical decision making, and, despite what some say, plenty of long term strategic control.  I just don't understand how some say there is no strategy because you don't know what all the cards will be each turn.

RATING: 7.5
One of the classics, especially for area control. Great game with 5 players in that it is very tense and interesting most of the way through.

I do feel like you need to play with a variant where turn order isn't clockwise from first player (person who played the lowest number). But instead each person goes based on the lowest number from last round. Would improve the strategy by a large amount and be less reliant on your neighbors.

[Only played with 2 players] An easy, quick game with short rounds but many options. Clever mechanics balance the game but don't get in the way. The theme, however, is very thin, even thinner as in Caylus. But that does not diminish the fun.

El Grande features a lot of very different mechanics that are intertwined very well. The Power Cards, the action cards and the Castillo could each make a small game on its own.
This also makes it more complex than many other Euros, but nevertheless it plays smoothly.

Definitive area majority game. Very brain draining and intesnse with lots of direct conflict. The mix of special cards and the trickiness of when to play your turn order cards provides lots of spice to each play.

[u]Key Words:[/u] Area Control - 3-5 Players - 90mins

[u]Summarized Opinion:[/u] One of the best area majority games around.

[u]My Rating Explained:[/u] Very good game. I love to play it.

[u]Verbose Assessment:[/u]

Although I'm not a fan of area majority games, I think this is one of the best.

There's much to keep an eye on: how do you play the power cards that will determine player order? Which of the action cards is the best? When to move the king, and to which region? Do I place my cabbalero's first? There's so many things to consider.

As with many of this type of game, El Grande suffers a bit from kingmaker syndrome with more than 3 players, so for me 3 is the sweet spot, offering enough control and avoiding multi-player chaos.

Original and strategic area majority game. Players attempt to move cubes depicting caballeros into various regions of Spain. Whenever scoring occurs, which takes place every four rounds, the players with the most cubes in a region score the most points. It's a deceptively simple game and there is an emphasis on cleverly positioning yourself in turn order so that you can make best possible use of the options available to you, but this is a deeply strategic game and is an essential play for those interested in the area majority style.

I bought the Decennial version when it first came out but haven't played it until recently.  I wasn't sure if I'd enjoy the game and thought it was a shot in the dark when I bought it.  However, it has been very enjoyable in 3 plays with my group.  Its definatly Eurosnoot at its best.  Not that I really have a preference b/w Euros and AT, I just want to enjoy a good game.  I can see where this one wouldn't be for everyone but I'd recommend everyone at least trying it once.

Just played this 14 years (!) after I bought it (somewhere around 1998).

A lot of games would have lost their shine by a long shot but this game... wow. Should have played this much, much, much earlier. 

What a smooth and elegant game design. It gives a very pleasant play experience, with just the right mix of 'gotcha', 'thinking' and 'pleasantness' as we played it.

Great game. Even for nowadays standards.

[EDIT OKT 2016] Ran into the El Grande Big Box at Spiel 2016. Thought about trading my base game, but the like the box, the map art, the castillo and even the cubes of the base game over the big box version. Ended up putting all expansions of the big box (including the updated cards) into the base game box and shelving the big box (with the base game cards) in the attic with my other empty expansion boxes. Now I just wonder if I'm ever going to USE those expansions, as the base game itself is actually so good on its own.

Great game that leaves you guessing throughout.  There are presumably some strategies that are better than others but with the turn mechanic you never know how the board will change from one turn to the next so you also need to make tactical adjustments.  Great fun.

This game is in a class of its own. So simple to teach, yet gameplay is incredibly deep and complex. It's a highly tactical game (in other words: interactive), and the tension from turn to turn is exceptionally high. You are continually forced to react to your opponents' decisions, and I find this to be a wonderful thing.

El Grande is exactly the all-time area control classic you've always heard about, and the best 5-player game I've ever played.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
El Grande is a very nice area control game that has a bit of bidding/bluffing in it that makes it very good.  There are a couple of different strategies, plus groupthink which can derail a game and change it completely.  I think this is a good thing.  You have to be adaptable to what everyone else at the table is doing.

With 5 players.  This is very very good.  With 4 players, it's a still good, but much more friendly.

I wondered if this game would be as good as is generally felt on the geek.  For the most part I have to agree with the ratings, however I guess I have one to many area control games right now so this was another in a long string of them that I have purchased which takes a bit of the edge off it.  To its benefit it plays a little faster than some of the other ones I have and the rules explanation didn't take me near as long as normal.  For now it is among the better of the area control games I own, but not many of them are so good that I rank them up in the 8 or 9 zone.

Really solid game.  I love that you only need the base rules, and only four new actions come in each round.  It makes the game very accessible for new players.  The fact that you score after every three rounds is a bit of a problem since it makes it easier to see who will win.

I think control of the king is too critical as well;  securing a region as well as getting 2 bonus points makes it too powerful during the scoring rounds.  I also don't quite grasp the Veto card.  

Oftentimes there are two players who don't have a chance to win after the sixth round.

I can see why this is a classic.  It does so many things well, from the bidding to determine turn order, dropping cubes in a tower, the King, and the variety of actions you can take.

But ultimately it is just a game about distributing your cubes into different regions such that your cubes score more points that your opponent's cubes.  That is just not a mechanic that I enjoy.  It's the same reason that I didn't really like [thing=142326][/thing] despite the fact that it did everything else right.

A clear, concise and reasonably fast-paced area control game that holds it's suspense until the end. Ergonomics-wise I think it's one of the best boardgames ever designed - the colors & graphics are very clear and easy to the eye and the various play aids (Castillo, scoring aid etc.) are very functional, the only fault being that the scoring track has no numbers. And, being set in medieval Spain gives it a very fitting theme.

RATING: 7
Dicennial edition. Played once with 5 players (the only way to play the game for sure). The game is very simple to play, but there are so many strategic options and the action cards make each game play differently, which is refreshing. The cards are a little hard to read from across the board, which makes the game play slower than it should. Maybe after players become familiar with graphics on the cards, it will be easier. Looking forward to more plays.

RATING: 8.8
A good game.  Simplistic in mechanics, but offers depth in decisions.  There will be some variety each game, and so forethought and flexibility will be required.  I foresee me liking this more as I play it.  I can't foresee myself EVER playing the expansions.

A fantastic game, best for 5, that really has the 'feel' of a regional political struggle.  With 5 players present, I'd always play this, despite its long playtime (especially long for a German game).

RATING: 10
This is my favourite of the classic Euro games.

It keeps you on your toes since the decisions of others are as interesting and nearly as impactful to your score as the decisions you make yourself.  Highly tactical.  It has great interaction with the other players as each jockeys for the best positions through the auction bidding and the manipulation of the pieces on the board.  

It's essentially themeless, which is usually a turn-off for me, but it's such a brilliant, stream-lined design that it wins me over completely.

Good-looking and functional board/pieces.  Looks great mid-game.

Best with five players, but still enjoyable with three or four.

You pick a card that determines your turn order and how many cubes you can take, then you choose to play a card that can have various effects on the game. This is to try to have the most cubes in the different regions on the board. Very simple area control game. I prefer a few other area control games (CitOW, Shogun), but this one is still fun to play on occassion.

My third euro, and still one of my favorites.  I've been playing it more with five players this year, which makes things tougher, as one player always has to take the weakest card.

I love these old style area control games. I need many more plays, though. Needs at least 4 it seems as the 3er I played was much too loose and had no way to reign in the runaway leader.

First Impression:
An area control eurogame that works perfectly well.

Before El Grande I was claiming that area control games should have some aspect of negotiation/territory building in order to provide a basis for the kingmaking that inevitably follows (f.e. I'm attacking you and not him because you didn't do this or that). And here comes this grandpa of boardgames to teach me never to say never. A eurogame that is pure area control, with minimum kingmaking. Sure you go after a specific player if you so want it, but you're going to finish dead last if you do so. With simple yet deep desicions, El Grande is a game that keeps the great interaction of area control, but discards the chaos of it with a clever drafting/hand management mechanism.

So what's not o like here? As an old euro the game doesn't try that much to carry its theme, though, surprisingly, it's far more thematic than many more modern boardgames.

Overall El Grande rejuvanated my faith for euro area control games. It's a v.good game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Didn't like this -- just wasn't very much fun.  Don't know why this is called a strategy game.  Due to the amount of chaos/changes that go on between turns, this is entirely a tactical exercise with no ability to make and carry out long term plans.  On top of that, it is slow to play with lots of downtime as others ponder their changed situations.  I'm willing to give it another try before writing it off completely, but I'm very skeptical that my rating will improve.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Nice decisions.  Angling.  Well thought out plans.  Then your opponents screws you over and you mutter to yourself, "Why Grande?, Why?"  The tactical points of the game are quite intuitive.  I'm still trying to hammer out the strategical side of things.  I'm sure its there, the games I've done well my board looked different than the games I haven't.  Its fun hammering away at this one.  I must find a way to rise above the chaos.... or at least get my head above water.   It just seems the winner is more of a function of the other players than what they accomplished.  The ability to hurt others far outweighs the ability to help yourself.  

I'd like to try this with 4.  I think that'd be my personal sweet spot.  It should pony up more control, leave the pure negative cards in the unused pile, because it would be responded to because of the threat, but not used because of its lack of benefit to the person picking the card.  I'm not sure it would rise more than a point though.  

I like everything about the design.  There are great decisions to be made, but at the end of the game I'm always left disappointed in who managed the victory.  It never feels like it was the person who played the best game, but was left alone the most. (even, especially?  when I win)

I pre-ordered this from Thought Hammer in October of 2005, and it didn't arrive until the end of July of 2006, but it was worth the wait!  This is one of my new favorite games, and definitely has the potential to move up to a 10 rating with repeated plays.  I just can't get enough of area control games it seems -- UPDATE: Moved it up to a 10 because after every game I finished I immediately want to play again.  The game is so fantastic because without being too complicated or convuluted it manages to present you with a lot of difficult decisions to make.  The game is pretty fast paced because there's little down time and it's crucial to stay involved on everyone else's turn.  One of the very best games out there in my opinion!

The grand-ioso (a-ha) game of area majority. This game defies me: I want to play it right, to do well, but I end up in a fierce AP and with nothing to show for it. I lose to other players that took half the time I used in my turn. I do come close everytime though.

Anyway, if you strip the body of area majority you will find that the backbone of it is the Grande piece.

Good area majority game, however took far too long to play (2.5 hours with 5) and there are similar games (San Marco - Web of power) that play far quicker.

In this award-winning game, players take on the roles of Grandes in medieval Spain. The king's power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various provinces. To that end, you draft caballeros (knights) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of provinces. After every third turn, the regions are scored, and after the ninth turn, the Grande with the most points is deemed the winner.

The game is as advertised... simply amazing! I have enjoyed every single game I have played, with varying number of players. The balance and uncertainty of choices really makes this game shine. The only worry I have is that there are a lot of variable power cards, but since you only get so many choices each round, explanations of these cards don't have to be made early on prior to the game. The castillo device is unique and increases the tension of the game. The base game is fun enough that I have not even yet try the expansion.

It has at least been several years since I last played El Grande. The game is still the grand daddy of all area majority games. After several more years of gaming experience and replaying this game, I realized how cut throat and unpredictable this game can become. This is not necessarily a criticism, but given how much control we want in our actions, sometimes the action cards can really stymie how we choose to play. Still, nothing is hidden and all the available actions are in plain sight. So, in a way, you can try to mitigate the actions by choosing to go first in turn order. I would consider the game high conflict. With our low conflict group, the tensions ran high (very unusual for this even keeled gang of friends). Still, as tempted as I am to lower my ratings, this game will remain high on my perch of games that is both fun and challenging: something I find amazing given the amount of games I have played and the fact that this game is 16 years old.

Just played it at Origins 04.  Many of the mechanics were new to me.  Maybe I was tired, but I just did not get this game at all (got whooped, too).  I liked Maharaja alot, so maybe I will like it better if I try again.  I got a chance to play again at PrezCon 05, and I definately liked it better.  It still doesn't feel like the game of games that some people claim it is, but it is also supposed to be a subtle game, and I like the sound of that.  I look forward to my next chance to play, but it is not worth owning yet, IMO.

RATING: 4
Where do the hype come from? Ok, the game mechanics are nice, but the caballeros and grandes doesnt mean anything. They seldom turn to anything else but abstractions, even for me, though I have played it about ten times. It is playable and slightly enjoyable with hyperdeductionists but with normal people, even those who prefer gaming, its just boring. They do not grasp the idea, they do not emotionally understand the underlaying mechanics and they never want to play it again. The game is based on five players, and for each player less than that it looses a lot.

Grant beat us to it.  Looks like a good one.

We play this with five exactly.  It's also served well as an intro game for quite a few new gamers.

Since the players can do a fair bit to each other, there is a fair amount of chaos. However, there are ways to mitigate it through the placement of your Caballeros. The Castillo is a lot of fun when you're parachuting to the board, since there is a lot of double think going on. The game is a lot of fun, with both new and experienced people, since it is difficult to have a runaway leader

Best part of this game is the name and the inevitable female reaction when you whip out El Grande, slap him on the board, and watch him tower, erect and proud, above the  less well-endowed pieces in the game.

I've rarely seen my wife at a loss for words, but all she could manage was a mirth-choked "you're having me on, right?  What's El Grande's real name? Johnson? Richard?"

This game is alright, but you'll be best served if you understand going into it that it is very minimal.  This is one of the granddaddies of Euros, and it shows.  Coming back to it as I have, it does not really feel original, because it's been copied by so many other games out there, and it doesn't have a gimmick like any new game in the category will have.  This is sparse, barebones area majority.  But it certainly does some things well.  There's conflict just beneath the skin, which is always a plus for me.  The scoring in different regions is quite entertaining, and the cards provide a good, but not excessive amount of randomness.

1play. 5 players. It is not that this is a bad game but a game that I certainly wouldn't want to play again. I didn't like the feeling of being trapped in one area. There didn't appear to be any flexibility in placing my cubes. I should also note that I played this game when I first got into boardgaming but I still get the heebee jeebies when I think about it. Not one I would play again.

Based on a single play, this game deserves its high rating on BGG. The game is complex and interesting, but the rules are simple. My husband last played El Grande a decade ago and was able to teach new players.

I don't think I've ever won this game- I lack whatever skill it is that this game measures. In any event it is a true classic, and one I'll play if suggested, but not a personal favorite.

Here's the thing: I admire area control games, even though I don't do well at them.  When the theme and the game mechanisms come together well, then I don't mind playing them.  With El Grande, though, there's too much of a chaotic "I'm a-gonna mess with your shit!" element to the game for me to really stomach it.  I like that the designer added some other touches to prevent it from being completely random, but in the long run, there's too much in the game that can mess with your carefully laid plans.

Ένα μοναδικό area control παιχνίδι με πολλές ανατροπες.Δεν πρέπει να σκέφτεσαι καθόλου τον εαυτό σου πάρα μονό αν είσαι πρώτος. Αν δεν είσαι πρώτος πρέπει να σκεφτείς πως θα καταστρέψεις αυτόν που είναι
Αν δεν σκεφτούνε όλοι έτσι μπορεί ο προπορευόμενος παίχτης να μην πέσει ποτέ από την κορυφή
Αρκετό interaction και στρατηγική που ανατρέπονται από γύρο σε γύρο από κάρτες ενεργειών που έχεις δικαίωμα να εκτελέσεις. Απλά ένα πολύ όμορφο παιχνίδι. Πάρα πολλά επιτραπέζια έχουν βασιστεί σε αυτό το πρωτοποριακό παιχνίδι. Στην θεωρία παιχνιδιών όταν μιλάμε για area control, μιλάμε για El Grande.

In this award-winning game, players take on the roles of Grandes in medieval Spain. The king's power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various provinces. To that end, you draft caballeros (knights) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of provinces. After every third turn, the regions are scored, and after the ninth turn, the Grande with the most points is deemed the winner.

RATING: 8
After seeing El Grande in the BGG top ten for a few years but never getting the opportunity to play, I finally broke down and bought it blind. Thankfully, the game has lived up to its stellar reputation.

Truth be told, I was actually a little surprised at just how simple the rules to El Grande turned out to be. I guess I was expecting a heavier rule set, along the lines of Caylus or Die Macher. Still, simplistic or not, the balancing act between drafting good action cards and maintaining a good flow of caballero tokens makes for an incredibly engaging game. There is also a nice bit of diplomacy that creeps into the game, as players must often work together to reign in anyone that starts to score big and pull away from the group. There is also a fair bit of secret deployment that goes on, which again creates an atmosphere of negotiation and double cross.

I haven't played it enough to know if it really has the legs to be a top ten game for me, but I can say that my initial impressions have been very, very good.

A fun area control game. Players bid for the order of play, with the lowest bidding cards letting them bring more caballeros into their court. Then, in order, players choose the action cards, which give them a special action and tell them to place from 1-3 caballeros on the board.

The game feels chaotic with 5 people, as things can shift around wildly. I'll have to play again at some point :)

Difficult decisions, subtle ramifications, diplomacy, lookahead, and for me, the theme actually works.  It isn't really as deep as it first appears, but it's always fun, and plays quickly.  Great stuff.

I have only played this game once since I have picked it up, but it is an incredible game.  The number of decisions to be made is enormous, and the game play is fast.  Also, it seems like players are not really out of the game until the final scoring round determines the winner.
REVISED - Make this game an 11, it is that good.

REVISION II - After playing this game quite a bit, I can say that this game is one of the best ones out there.  It works well with 4, but is best with 5.  The angst with 5 is great, do you take the power to deny it to another player, or do you go for the one that is going to set you up better for the next turn, etc., etc.  If you're stranded with 5 other people on a desert island, this is definitely a game you want to have with you.

A classic area control game. El Grande has aged extremely well, I love the purity of this design and the tense decision-making. The whole system of "initiative cards" is brilliant. Highly recommended!

Very simple, but every move has it (short and/or long term) consequences.

RATING: 7
Neat game.  A little tough to get into on your first game though - there's no way you can cover all the action cards,  and I'd imagine advanced players know what's in which deck.  And counting what goes into the castille is important - I forgot I had put things in there,  which could have changed strategies.  Silly memory.

Downsides - having this huge variety of actions seems a bit fiddly to me -  added complexity that complicates things for newcomers. 

Urgh...looks like those printing errors in the Decennial edition won't be going away any time soon.   Even though this is on my list of "must-buy classic games",  I'll probably play the open copy at Drexoll's before committing.

Muy sencillo y para todos los públicos. Táctico y estratégico a partes iguales, consiste en influenciar mayoritariamente las provincias con los caballeros respecto a los rivales. Importante decisión el saber escoger adecuadamente las acciones de juego (de ello depende todo). Muy rejugable, reglas sencillas y para todo tipo de jugadores. Algo de análisis-paralisis puede haber en la elección de acciones y en la colocación de caballeros. Si no aseguras tu posición y estrategia, la partida puede dar muchos giros inesperados pero predecibles.

Incluye las expansiones de El Rey y el Intrigante, Grandissimo y El Gran Inquisidor y Las Colonias. Con fundas cuadradas tamaño 70x70mm, fundas tamaño eurogame 59X91mm y fundas tamaño mini-eurogame 44x67mm.

What I Like-
The card drafting, bid for turn order, and timing tension. Constant maneuvering based on card choices.

What I Dislike-
You can sometimes get taken out of a game if another player constantly challenges your areas, which can allow the other players to run away from you victory point wise.

An absolutely fantastic game, one of the most elegant design ever created. Everything in this game works perfectly and every game is a tense interesting experience. It's an old school masterwork, only what is essential is present, nothing is there without a reason.
The perfect game for a clash of minds.

Kingmaking is possible, maybe this is the only flaw but how many games with interaction don't have KM?
Analysis paralysis is also possible but this depends more on the people you are playing with and with THIS game i am willing to be more tolerant of AP.

A very interesting game. After a while I thought it was too chaotic and random with the cards, but now found into it again.

One of those games you need to play a lot in order to understand the underlying strategies and become good at it. It also helps a lot if you know which cards are in the game. Nevertheless, it holds its own even if you play it every once in a while, because the rules are very straightforward even for people who aren't heavily into board gaming.

A old duke of a game that some of my regular game group find a little dry. I really like its theme and elegant mechanics that reward good play with a minimum of randomness.
The only problem is that I can never remember who put what in the castillo. And that includes me about 5 seconds after I've done it!

I've seen a lot of AP comments, and I can understand where they come from. It has a lot of facets, and I think it takes a few plays to really get to know this game. Not a bad game in all, but I'm not sure if this will ever be one of my favourites.

Terrific area control strategy game of Medieval Spain that withstands the aging of time.  Each round players select single use initiative cards from identical decks to get first dibs on action cards while placing knights for majority in territories adjacent to the King pawn's taboo territory. During scoring rounds the 3D castle tower reveals tucked away knights for majority points and the spin dial determines what territory they invade.

A classic  & a must have. I was worried that it would be dry & flat, but it hits the right chord with our group. It scratches a very different itch and provides a diversion of my usual Economic-euro flavor. Very linear reap & sow experience, you immediately reap the benefits of your good moves. One problem that may become apparent is the kill the leader - which is expected with this kind of games.

RATING: 10
This classic game of politics in Spain was a pioneer area-majority game and inspired a whole genre of modern games.  The build-up to the scoring, the scrambling for position, and the possibility for sweeping changes and brilliant moves make this game a masterpiece.

This is one of the best examples of a tactical game where players really need to be flexible from turn to turn.  You can not usually plan a long-term strategy in El Grande, because there are so many unpredictable events, especially in the 4 or 5 player game.  Every game of El Grande is unique, challenging and fun.

Een moderne klassieker. Wat zou er gebeurt zijn als dit spel had doorgebroken i.p.v. de kolonisten.

De spelers proberen de macht te grijpen in de verschillende regio's van spanje, door hun cabbalero's in deze regio's te plaatsen. Degene die bij puntentellingen de meeste in een regio heeft staan krijgt het hoogst aantal punten.

Vooral ingenieus zijn de kaarten waarmee de volgorde bepaald, want ga je voor vroeg in de spelersvolgorde, of wil je meer cabbalero's naar je hof halen. En welke actie kies je dan, want er zijn zeer veel verschillende die iedere beurt open komen te liggen.

RATING: 10
I really enjoy this one. I feel like it's very easy for a beginner to pick up and a couple mistakes do not push you totally out of competition for the win. It has very little randomness and that can be minimized by your bidding for turn. Vets do have an advantage due to knowing the cards but nobody in our group is that hardcore. :) Highly  recomended and it's certainly a good gateway into the heavier games.

[CK]

Area control is a mechanic that appeals to me when I play games like Louis XIV, Struggle of Empires, and Age of Empires III. However, those games involve the development of infrastructure or additional mechanics like worker placement; by comparison, El Grande is an exercise in pure tactical area control. What I find occurs in such games is that players place their influence or use screw-your-neighbor opportunities to keep everyone else in check and the guy picked on least by his opponents will win.

After a few scorings someone is out in front, and players must bash the leader because if unhindered he will maintain first place and ultimately win. Put another way, when a player gets an opportunity that scores him extra points, in all likelihood the action is actually worthless because he will lose points later that he otherwise would have scored because his opponents are obligated to target him. If this process is performed effectively, players' scores will remain within a small range, and big plays around the third scoring will decide the game.

El Grande's excessively tactical nature has other issues. The value of a Mobile Scoring tile varies wildly depending on whether the other two copies of it are lurking right below. A typical plan to drop '13' and have the last word on the King's whereabouts can be arbitrarily thwarted by Royal Advisor. Decay of Authority is extremely nasty and fear of the card nullifies an actual strategy like playing 1-3 within the first half of the game to enable 10-13 for the second half. Turn order introduces problems as well; many turns nobody selects the 1-stack, screw-your-neighbor actions because of the restriction on piece placement but when a player is dropping '1' this turn no matter what to prepare for next turn's pre-scoring '13' he'll often be stuck picking between the 1-stack or some crappy 2-stack card so he'll take the screw-your-neighbor - a completely situational shaft if you happen to be that neighbor encroaching on what he considers his turf.

Its just placing cubes. Who has the most in that area get points. And omg, there's also a tower where u can get your cubes in for a huge insane surprise at the end even though u see your competitors putting them in during the game. The end. One of the most boring games I've played. To me this doesn't even qualify as a game, but work. Even after playing it numerous times theres nothing growing in it. I just do it to trade my friends into playing games they dont like ;)

Excellent area control game with lots of indirect interaction (by virtue of muddling with people's scoring potential and bidding). Lots of difficult choices, and a large mix of different things to do (bidding, forced scoring, various actions, etc). The downside, like PR, is that a poorly planned move by one player can severely impact the score of several others, without their knowledge. The potential for kingmaking other players through poor (or even intentional) decisions is clear, but the fact that information and scoring are public offsets this disadvantage somewhat.

A game that&#039;s grown on me.  If everyone must read all the card texts in full, ponder the implications of each choice, then move, this game will take forever.  Familiarity with the actions improves the enjoyment level of this game immensely.

Now that I've got some more play in with this one, I do find it a little frustratingly chaotic with players of differing skill and experience levels.  Often too many opportunities created by the newbie of the bunch.  With good players, it's a real tactical showdown, though.   It's got very clever and elegant mechanics, and it's quite an attractive game too.

Still formulating my ultimate opinion on this puppy due to the fewish number of games played; though I must declare that I love all the wooden cubes, the slender tower, the beautiful board, and the massive king pawn.
El Grande is a lot of fun to play, and can take a while, though the time invested is certainly worth the effort.
This is a well-designed Euro game, possibly the best. The rules are fast to master and well explained. Also, other than the hidden cubes within the confines of the castle, this is a game of perfect information: no dicerolling is required. Solid play will always triumph during a game of El Grande.

There is much to admire with this game. I also like the fact that the score track surrounds the play area; the same can be said of the turn sequence track.

A classic quintessential area control game.  The placement and scoring are simple enough, but adding in some fun tricks linking turn order, special actions and supply of cubes to add to the map make El Grande something special.  If you enjoy area control I highly recommend you try this excellent game at some point.  If you don't like controlling areas you will however not like this game.

As good as advertised. Nice, heavy thinker, with a little bit of everything: auctions, bluffing, action cards. Great.

RATING: 9
Quite honestly, for about 2/3 of my first game, I wasn't quite sure what the big deal is about El Grande.  The bidding mechanism has already been done elsewhere; the randomness of the cards was often a source of frustration; and it certainly didn't help that I was pulling the rear.  The scoring was somewhat unique, as well as the attainment and placement of your pieces, but for the most part I felt very out of sync throughout the game, I wasn't sure what strategy to use.  However, things began to click into place at the last third of the session, and surprisingly I managed to win in the end.  I definitely can't credit that to great playing on my part, but what I had first thought to be a foregone conclusion in terms of the leaders, I am most certainly intrigued by the change in the final scoring.  There is definitely more than meets the eyes here, and I for sure will want to try this again.

Update #1: So far I'm 3-0 in El Grande.  Have I figured this game out?  Not sure, the first two times I didn't really have any strategy so I assumed I won because of luck rather than any skillful playing on my part.  The most recent session did involve a much more careful consideration and planning, while maintaining the same importance on one factor that I've employeed successfully before.  I ended up at least 12 points ahead the 2nd place.  I think I'm liking this more and more.

RATING: 8.5
The classic area-influence game.  If you're into Eurogames and haven't played El Grande yet, you don't know what you're missing.  To me, has stood the test of time (almost ten years old and I still would never refuse a game).  A superb design.  Ratings update: dipped slightly to 8.5 due to the potential lack of control of how others can screw you over.  Kingmaking potential exists, even at the cost of hurting you if you're not in the lead at the time.

RATING: 7.9
Very simple game, but so many possibilities. Played this one with just 2 players, and to be honest. It isn’t suitable as a 2 player game. You have to play this with 3 or 4 players. With 5, it might take just too long before one turn is over. 4 players would be a perfect group. Every player can choose a special action, without being forced to ‘just to take the last one, just because it’s the only one left’. The auction of the turn-order is important, because you can play a certain power-card just only once.  Tactics will become more important, because the King would be dancing around the gameboard. The tower (Il Castillo), will be way more difficult to count all the Caballero’s that are disappearing inside it. Great game, but you have to be with 4 players (or 3).

I'm a big fan of this game.  It was one of the first German games I played.  It seems to hit the table on a regular basis and always seems to play well.  I think the Castillo is one of the best features of the game.  While the theme seems somewhat of a pastie, I would still say, "Buy this game."

Pleasant!  Pacing yourself for proper competetiveness at each of the scoring phases is very interesting, especially since you can't be too sure when opportunities for special scorings will crop up.  You want to be able to capitalize on those yourself, and your opponents have little use for them.

A játék a XV. századi Spanyolországon alapul, ahol öt etnikai csoport verseng egymással.;) Mindegyikben a magas arisztokrácia (Grande-k) és az átlagos arisztokrácia (Caballerok) kap fontos szerepet. Minden régióban növelni próbálják hatalmukat és befolyásukat. Ebben a kastélyok (Castillos) is fontos szerepet játszanak. A játék célja: Minden játékos egy régió Grandeja. Van 30 szövetséges lovagja (Caballeroja). Mindegyik Grande megkísérli Spanyolországban megszerezni a legnagyobb befolyást azáltal, hogy a lovagjaikkal megpróbál többséget szerezni minél több régióban. 

Vélemény a játékról: Az egyik legszínvonalasabbnak tartott játékom. :meeple: (A BGG-n benne van a Top 20-ba). Kemény küzdelem végig a játék folyamán sok interakcióval. Nagy kihívás megszerezni a legjobb akciókártyákat, melyekkel nagyobb befolyást tudunk elérni, ebben segít a jó helyzetfelismerés és előretervezés. Tetszik a játékossorend meghatározása (hatalomkártyák kijátszása dönti el), a kastély (ahová betehetünk lovagokat és át is helyezhetjük pontozáskor), a titkos korong és pontozótáblák használata, valamint az, hogy be lehet állítani a játék hosszát a fordulók meghatározása által (1,5, vagy 2 óra legyen a játék).  Egy kis negatívum, hogy 2 játékossal nem igazán élvezetes. Ajánlanám hozzá a kiegészítők beszerzését, melyek magasan emelik a játék színvonalát. Itt gondolok a König & Intrigant-ra (ami számos akciólapot ad plusszba és segítségével könnyebb egyéni stratégiát felépíteni), valamint a Grossinquizitor und Kolonien-t és Grandissimo-t, melyek eseménydússá teszik a játékot (5 új régió, hajózás, kereskedelemi áruk, 2 új akciópakli, Inkvizítor és lovagjai, tömlöc és királynő).

Játék tartozékairól: nem a legdesignosabbak, de visszaadja  középkori hangulatot. 

Szabálykönyvről: Nagyon jó felépítésű, könnyen érthető és magyarázható (kb 15 perc). 

Kiknek ajánlanám: gémereknek, akik szeretik az összetett stratégiát. :laugh:

After 10+ Plays: When played with five this is absolutely one of my favorite games.  With fewer it is still fun, but a pale imitation of the 5-player game.  It's one of the more directly confrontational euros, as nearly every point gained is one taken from an opponent.  The restrictions on placement related to the king really make the game.  To many area control games actually give you too many options.  Paradoxically I think there are more interesting strategic choices when you don't have access to all possible placements.  The cards add two great levels of decision making.  The first is knowing when to bid high for turn order to grab a card you really want.  The second is the careful weighing of the benefits of using a betters card's power, or taking a less powerful card just to get more cubes onto the board.

I've played with a couple of the expansions, and I don't think they are worth the time.  I would still like to try the one that totally does away with the existing cards.  It sounds like a completely different game using El Grande's basic area majority structure.  I doubt I'll like it more, but I'd like to compare.

Interesting in that the story/objectives can change, depending on how well you do on earlier ones. Standard mediocre co-op fare, beyond that. The "map" isn't very map-like.

RATING: 7
Uncertain as to replayability with the set missions, but there is more variety than expected with the small set of "Captain's Log: Supplemental" cards used per game. Some of these cards can throw the mission for a loop, and that's what makes this more "replayable" than it might at first appear.

All-in-all, we're having fun with this. That's what counts.

RATING: 7
Great production value on all components.  The gameplay is fun, though unlike Pandemic or Forbidden Island (or even Lord of the Rings LCG), you are not so much trying to survive as you are trying to get the best possible score, so the game does seem a bit lacking in tense moments.

There's definitely strategy involved in playing well, though there's a bit of randomness with cards and dice, but all in all it never seems like you face a no-win scenario and it does seem that quality of play will affect the outcome.  There's a bit of variation in the way the four different characters play, but the special abilities in this game don't seem as important as in a game like Pandemic.

Replay value is the main drawback to this game.  After a few plays, the mission seems samey.  Still holding out hope that expansions will include new missions and not just new characters.

Star Trek Expeditions is an interesting concept.  The crew is on an away mission to help a planet avert a civil war, a natural disaster, and pressure to join the Klingon Empire (think about "Errand of Mercy").

Ultimately, it is a balancing/optimization puzzle of fighting off a Klingon warship, gather crew (not sure what that represents in actual terms), solving crisis situations.

The Clix system is a great idea, allowing you to take damage to the characters (spend actions to get healed) and the ship (spend cards to repair).
At the end of the day, it kind of fits in with the Star Trek theme, albeit an extreme situation.  The co-op portion works ideally in this situation.  The game play is solid with various levels of difficulty and expansion characters to add to the game-to-game variance.

There are better co-op games, but this is a pretty solid effort.

Not my favorite coop.  Seems like a typical coop game, as of late.  Twice as long, but certainly less fun than [b]Forbidden Island[/b].  Didn't care about the flavor text and score.  Pretty mechanical.

It's got character, poorly laid out rules, and cool clickies. But [i]Pandemic[/i] and [i]Shadows Over Camelot[/i] are still superior to it.

Nice coop game that has a good story element. Not as mathy as Pandemic and the like. The theme really comes through. A bit on the easy side but you don't realize that until you are more than halfway through the game so it never detracted from my enjoyment of the game. I haven't played the most difficult level yet though. There is a lot going on in the game though and that is engaging for the players. You have the Enterprise to worry about, cards to manage among the players, tokens for bonuses, searching the planet for all of the story tiles and deciding which to tackle first. All of the elements work very well together and fit the theme perfectly.

The components are quite nice. The minis are exceptional and certainly add a level of enjoyment to the game but it is a pain in the butt having to pick them up every time you want to see your stats. We did find that if you set your figure along the edge of one of the cardboard tiles on the space and tilted the figure toward you you could then usually read the numbers without picking up the figure. But not so with the ships. We had a player sitting along the edge the starships are on and found that to be a good solution. That person could see the starship numbers and it became their job to read them off when needed. The only grip I have is that I've started seeing some warping of the score board and the Captain's Log tiles. They weren't warped when I opened the game but over the course of several days they slowly became more and more warped. I'll have to wait and see how bad this gets. 

Overall, I think this is a great buy if you are a Trek fan. Coop games have become so prominent that there is no reason to keep one if you do not enjoy the theme. The only issue I have would be repeated play. I can see WizKids putting out mini-expansions to add to the replayability of the game. If this happens this could be a heavily themed story based coop that will rival or more likely surpass the LotR coop game that Knizia did. However, if WizKids just makes another $50 Star Trek coop with a different story I wouldn't bother buying it. But give me a figure or two with new tokens and tiles to change the story and that would likely be a good seller.

I'm very glad to have finally gotten to try this game, but it is just not going to be a major winner for us.  I think several things are against it for us: 1) The need to play multiple characters is not a style we like (I might try to find a variant for this to try next time.) 2) While you can take the time to mitigate dice luck, that clearly eats away your score.  3) I spend too much time doing math to get into it thematically.  Kirk would be more likely to dive in to the action than count up all crew members and skills, but that would cause you to lose.  Overall, it's a decent game, but not one that leaves me itching to play again.

So far, I like it.  It's no Ghost Stories, but there are similarities.  I am loving the clix figures and ships.  It's definitely thematic, which is a plus for me.  I've heard that one can break the game if one acts "gamey".  I think I'll just play thematically and enjoy it instead.

If you like Star Trek you might like this game.  It is a co-op/ solo play game. It is not difficult to play and has some replayability.  However, if it did not have the Star Trek theme I would not have bought this game.  I recommend a play through before you buy unless you get a great deal like I did.

Well, it is not as bad as expected. In fact, it is an astonishing production (apart from the 3 dice which are pathetic). The gameplay might also offer some replayability, and the game itself offers interesting choices. It does not remind me of another game. If you are a star trek fan you have a stronger motive to pay attention to your score, apart from trying not to lose. The game is good. It works. It offers different challenges each time, considering the initial setup. My first play left me with a complete feeling of star trek and a good game. I would like to be able to offer more on replayability but unfortunately I don't own the game.

Very nice pieces, great ship models, and a decent storyline...but, the replay value is seriously lacking. My feelings about this game went from deliriously excited, to happy with the first few games, and then to "Well, okay, now what?" For $50, replay value is a big factor for me, and that's just too much money to spend on a handful of plays.

RATING: 7
Being a massive cooperative game fan, a fan of Reiner Knizia games, and a fan of the recent reboot of the Star Trek movie franchise I thought for sure this game was going to be the greatest game of 2011 for me by a mile. Well, while I did enjoy the experience of playing and would gladly play again, I just wasn't as wowed by it as I expected. The game does involve a lot of cooperation, and has some amazing components. The theme was there on the cards, and the images from the movie were just what I was seeking. The challenge was a bit light (I never really felt like we would fail) but I can see how the more difficult levels would change that feeling. But the execution of the missions felt very dry. Rolling 2 dice to determine if you fail or succeed usually brings out a loud chorus of cheers or groans of defeat. Yet the die rolls felt a little anticlimactic as you rolled first and then added 6+ different modifiers to the roll to see if you succeeded. Perhaps in the future I will make a point of adding up modifiers first and then determining what roll is needed (that might ramp up the tension.) In summary, the game wasn't bad (I did like playing it), but it lacked that spark to make me want to rush out and buy a copy.

'Basic Math Fun with the Enterprise Crew!'...except minus the fun.  This game is very very mathy, it's all about collecting +2 here and +1 there.  And +3 from that.  And +2 because of this and +2 because of that.  Sound like fun yet?  

The Enterprise vs. Klingon Cruiser orbit battle is very unbalanced as well, it seems virtually impossible for the Enterprise to hold ground, let alone impart damage.

Not a fan of the stats being on the clix bases either...very difficult to read, and even more difficult to know how far from zero you are.  More obvious damage/skill tracks would be welcome.

I really wanted to like this, but it feels way to mathy, not very exciting, the ecology/energy misprint is bothersome, and the win conditions are out of whack. I like my co-ops to be 50/50 affairs, not "score your highest score" like this ends up being, even on the high difficulty. Ugh.

RATING: 8
This is one of those games that if I just played it once, and never again, I'd have given it a pretty low rating. But my son loves it, and so I play with him a lot. And after multiple plays, the game really grew on me.

It's not very evocative. An American publisher putting out a  game about [i]Star Trek[/i], I guess people expect a tonne of chrome. But it's a Knizia co-op, and it's really evocative for that type of game. It's theme is a lot better inegrated than LOTR.

Just another 100% co-operative game.  It's an okay game, but I don't often feel like playing multi-player puzzle games.  At times, it's challenging and tense but something about the 100% co-ops doesn't scratch the gaming itch for me.  A person only needs a few totally co-op games.  It's okay and probably a "buy" for Star Trek fans, but has limited replayability (since you'll memorize the events and their progression) until new missions are released.

The components are a big dowfall to this game. The card quality is not good, several of the minis dont 'clix' correctly and the haphazard packaging (no excuse for so many instances of missing/broken components) really throw big negatives into the mix for this one.

The gameplay is fun though and Pretty challenging, just a shame about the component quality :/

Good, but I'm not sure how much longevity it will have.  I think after 5 or 6 plays we'll probably be sick of it.  There isn't enough mission variety.  I'm not a fan of scoring points to see how "well" you did.  I prefer the Arkham Horror approach: you either save the world, or you're eaten.

If you've played this and weren't that impressed, be sure to play it on the Red level. Much tighter game. I liked it a lot. I might kick up the rating if it holds up. The highest level is clearly the "real game".

I enjoyed this, with a few caveats. It's the typical, tight Knizia design, with lots of interesting trade-offs and little rules grit. It feels like Lord of the Rings did, with good variability while retaining narrative cohesion.

However, this now being 2011 and not 1999, I do recommend that gamers and any Lord of the Rings or Pandemic veterans start at *least* on the Medium difficulty. Easy is just too easy and results in tension draining from the game later on.

The biggest issues here is probably a few major usability problems along with rules that are just a touch loose. The exact sequence of card play in starship combat is not as clear as it could be, but you can guess until we get clarification (it doesn't make that much difference - we played it to be as the same way as character challenges). More problematic though is type that is barely legible, with tiny font sizes in insufficiently contrasting colors. Some of the important data on the mission cards barders on unreadable if you are over 40. And look, I know it's WizKids, so you've got to have the clix pieces because that's what you do, but important unit statistics usually can't be seen, manipulating the pieces is a royal pain, and font sizes and icons are minuscule. A more traditional solution (like, a character card with a track) would have been far superior. The minis are great, but the clix are a bad solution to a non-existent problem in this context.

Anyway, usability problems aside, I enjoyed this and I think it'll be a welcome addition to our surprisingly limited stable of good cooperative games. Hopefully we'll get some expansions, as the game is clearly primed for them. If so, I hope we get some larger fonts.

I actually enjoyed my play of it, but it was too long and complicated for me in comparison to the enjoyment I got.

I like the idea of multiple storyline paths, but I found myself playing by the numbers, kind of ignoring the story. There's something about when challenges appear being disconnected from when they are attempted that acts to disincentivize reading the story.

However, that doesn't take away from the idea of three storylines being very interesting.

Initial rating a 6, but this could really change with more familiarity. Co-ops aren't always my favorite. I normally need something (A traitor, time pressure, etc.) to shake things up. But, most co-ops seem to succeed if the game provides sufficient pressure. Star Trek certainly provides pressure!

Really, the game will work for people if they get flavor out of the "choose your own adventure" style of events. But that might take a couple of plays to really appreciate. I'm willing to try this again to learn more about it.

Great game, I love co-ops. Nothing like lotr co-op by Kinizea.

Interesting balance in the game. When you play 1 character you get all the crew cards and this gives an advantage. When you play with more characters you can split up and cover more ground. I find both strategies effective, it does not matter how many characters you play, it balances well.

Other than SFB and other less deserving ship-to-ship combat games, surprisingly, there are not a lot of good Star Trek boardgames.  Well, wait no more.  This is a good (not great) Star Trek game. It is coop. It is tense (at medium or high level). It is a bit of a number cruncher. But most of all, it is thematic.  If you allow/indulge yourself, you WILL feel like you are part of an episode of the one of the series (even though the game is based on the recent movie reboot).

Players play characters from the Enterprise, trying to calm things down on a planet, while dealing with a Klingon threat in orbit.  Players on their turn flip the now standard cooperative card of doom (Stardate card) to advance the clock, and do other assorted nasty things.  This could trigger the Klingon ship to attack the Enterprise, a clever mechanic to take points off the player's score and possibly knock them out of the game.  Players are then granted 2 to 4 actions to beam around and do stuff, with the ultimate aim being to complete three plot thread of three components each.  How well you complete a thread dictates which piece of the plot comes next, along with its associated requirements.  It's a clever mechanic, and ensures expansion plots can be inserted cleanly by simply adding in sets of seven plot cards.  The players lose the game if they run out of time, or lose the Enterprise.  They win the game by resolving the three plots, but are assessed on how well they did by awarding victory points.  Thematically, the game works very well - much better than pushing cubes around a Pandemic board.  The Knizia engine is fairly bullet proof.  Some production issues are irritating, otherwise, one of the better cooperatives out there.  Longevity may be a problem..

Other than the components, there really isn't anything great about this game.  The game dragged way too long for my tastes.  It's disappointing to hear that there are not any plans for new mission cards in the works.  Give it a pass.

UPDATE: Any lack of continued support from WizKids really shortens the lifespan of this game. They could have made more missions pretty easily but without them it's really easy to get tired of this game.

Preliminary impressions are pretty good. It's not going to replace Pandemic as my favorite co-op game but we all had a good time with it. We'll have to see if it holds up to repeated plays. Desperately needs more expansions than a few figures though.

RATING: N/A
Fun game, cool figures.  The expansion adds a little variety, but unfortunately unless they come out with more expansions you can only play it so many times (if they release more expansions -- especially new cards -- I would bump it up another notch or two).  

Some people have commented that they thought some of the cards are a little flimsy, but I don't think that is the case (the thinner cards are made of cloth or something like that and seem pretty durable to me... and the other cards are a very thick cardboard).

A light co-op race game with really nice bits.  The gameplay is pretty simple, but it does make great use of the "clix" dials to track variable stats.

I enjoyed this more than I thought I would considering the designer and I look forward to seeing what expansions can do for the replayability issue.

Got this as a Christmas gift, so we all played it on Christmas Day (my wife and 2 grown sons). We are classic geeks and somewhat Trekkies, and to say the least, we loved this very co-op game of an away mission that has twists and turns. We finished with a respectable score at the end. There is so much potential here for future away mission expansions, but I have read elsewhere, this is all there will be. Too bad, but still a great Trek experience as is. We will do this one again in future family get togethers. (Holidays are special as it is the only time we see our older son, who lives in the northeast vs our Southern location).

Add up modifiers, roll some dice and hope you win.  I'm not a huge fan of co-ops and this is no exception.  The modifiers make this quite gamey, and consequently most of the "flavour" is lost.  So, if you aren't playing a themed game for the theme, why are you playing. Yet another Knizia Paste-on-theme, this time with a Movie Licence... pass.  3/10

I found this to be highly enjoyable, for what it is.  It is a bit of a light game, with surprisingly few rules once you understand the unnecessarily thick rulebook.  I enjoy the theme (while I'm not a "Trekkie") and it seems like it should be fairly accessible to those that are less gamer inclined.  Even though it is a fun game, I'm not particularly sure that it's all that great of a game.  The number of cards and tokens is very small for what the game is trying to do.  Replayability WILL be an issue as the number of plays increases.  They should have doubled the number of Supplemental and Stardate cards in the base set.  Also, the quality of the cards is terrible in typical Wizkids fashion.  Plan on sleeving immediately.

Addendum:  The clix feature is a lame gimmick that I wish Wizkids would abandon in all their games.

"Star Trek: Equations" by Reiner Knizia

Add up a bunch of fussy die roll modifiers and try to hit your target number. Repeat. There's a little bit of planning that is somewhat interesting, but the logistical puzzles are very simple and shallow. The missions are rather flavorless pieces of arithmetic, and the scripts don't vary from game to game. Finally, the victory conditions suck. The missions have various "degrees" of success, which means you just compute a score at the end. The stakes feel way too low, with little tension and no sense of impending doom.

The bottom line is that Star Trek Expeditions just isn't worth playing when there are so many better cooperative games. And that's a big disappointment, since this is the designer who pretty much created the genre with the brilliant Lord of the Rings.

RATING: 7
This one is on the edge to get an 8, but a fear of not enough replayability keep it down. Maybe it also slightly too easy to win witn easy and medium level (still have to try hard level). But the theme and mechanics are really good, but I not really fond of the clix mechanism and would preferred to have markers on a player mat or the board to keep track of the stats.

RATING: 7
Two plays with four players at the "Captain" difficulty, two plays with four at the "Admiral" level, and then also a few solo plays. 

I'm not a fan of cooperative games, but this one is pretty engaging. I feel like the cooperative element is more fun and satisfying here than in any of the other cooperative games I've played (Pandemic, Battlestar Galactica, Betrayal at the House on the Hill). Nobody feels like they're supporting cast in Star Trek: Expeditions, and players really have to work together and come up with ideas for solving problems. 

A word of warning, though: Star Trek: Expeditions does have a slightly abstract feel to it, despite the all the thematic elements. The Klingon ship is a menace, to be sure, and time is short, but the plot lines on the main crisis cards somehow fail to really engage my imagination. On top of that, there are so many little modifiers to the dice rolls that it's hard to get excited about picking up any particular one. 

[b]Last and totally important:[/b] players who want to have a tough do-or-die experience like Pandemic will want to play the hardest level of the game. It's not impossible, but you really need to have your sh*t together. At the easiest level you're just playing for score, and the middle level is dangerous for newbies but only just threatening for experienced players. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun game about tough choices and team work, but at times it seems a bit overcomplicated. Then there's the requirement of dice rolls for everything, which means the game can be ruined by repeatedly encountering unlucky rolls.

Oh, and my Enterprise broke off of the stand after normal use.

9/14/13 - Played a solo game the other night and really hammered down the rules. This game is quite a bit better than originally thought. I bumped the rating up from a 6 to a 7. Now that I'm not screwing some things up in the setup and actual play of the game, I think the rating can only go up from here.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Fun game I expect to play 4-5 more times before I wait for the expansion. Plays well with any number of players, including solo. The theme comes through loud and clear and contributes to the fun. Decisions are thematic, too, it never felt like the theme was pasted onto a dry mechanic. The components are top-notch, the insert is actually useful, and it's overall a great game. I look forward to the expansions!

RATING: 7.052
An episode of Star Trek, in a board game, in about 60 minutes!  The clix system is a good fit.  Even though I think the system could have been applied to any theme, you can't help but make Trek references/jokes throughout the game.  Worried about re-playibility, as after several plays I'm already seeing the same things happen in each game.

Components are so-so, especially the cards.

RATING: 8
Obligatory for any "Star Trek" fan who doesn't hate cooperative games. It's a shame that it's linked to Jar Jar Abrams' reboot, but fortunately it appears that Knizia didn't even see the movie, as the storyline has nothing to do with it and could easily belong to an episode of the classic series.

There are special events and battles against a Klingon cruiser, but the core system reminds me of those old gamebooks ("Fighting Fantasy" and the like). You progress through three missions, with three stages each, to different outcomes depending on your degree of success at the challenges. It's very interesting and engaging.

Apart from printing problems such as the unbelievable error on the score board, the only big flaw is the horrendous "Clix" system. Taking the miniatures off the board to see the tiny numbers and rotate the dials gets annoying pretty fast. Good old cards with markers would have worked much better.

There may be a replayability issue, as the game comes with a single adventure. Adding new adventures via expansions should be easy, but, sadly, it seems the first expansion will only contain new characters.

Definitely too easy on the easiest difficulty. Beyond that, a solid and enjoyable design, as you would expect from the good doctor. The components are awfully nice, though I can understand why some people dislike a) usability design (fonts, clicky et al--though I will forever love clickies), b) the characters' paint jobs, c) the generally bad cardstock. All of that said, the starships are outstanding, and on that I will brook no dissent.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Interesting cooperative game that draws a lot from battlestar galactica only without the traitor mechanic.  As such, I think it is a strong game but won't ever reach the greatness of BSG.  It's also a lot shorter, and easier to grasp.  I'd like to play it one more time before finalizing my rating, or could go up or down a point.

The challenges mostly felt a bit easy while the ship battles felt very hard.  We won the game after really not doing a very good job on medium difficulty.  Overall it is too easy but the expansions should fix that.  As others have said the clicky bases add nothing to the game. Also the missions have great flavor text but the energy cards need some more to feel immersed.  Overall I think it is a decent game that could probably enter the realm of greatness is they do something interesting with the expansions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7

On the one hand you have magnificient miniatures of the enterprise and of a Klingon battlecruiser, but you have also a bland board and flimsy cards.
The cogs and wheels are quite average, the story is acceptable.
This game is... average.  With so many good games to play, expedition would never be my first choice.
Be sure to play on the lowest difficulty only to learn the game, because otherwise it's totally uninteresting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Theme is well rendered for a Knizia, but ST:TNG or ST:TOS or even ST:E would have been a better setting.  Of course, they could all have been used.

Components are nice, but the "Energize" cards are a tad thin, but the "web" coating helps.  Counters and especially the mission cards are made of thick cardboard.

Game play wise, I'm not sure.  The mechanic seems Ok, but something does not seem to jive.  The space combat is more or less pointless, as unless you get lucky with the die roll, and the Klingon die does not come up with the battlev (repair), nothing much seems to occur.  No one selected "Attack" as the odds were that bad.

The actual "Challenges" work Ok, and trying to get the right combination crew can be quite a challenge.  Then you add a die roll to all this...  The randomness level is fairly high for a Knizia.

The clix is a neat idea, but it is not well suited for this kind of game, IMHO.

With four seasoned gamers, the medium difficulty was a tad easy. We cleared the entire board (save one trap encounter foreseen by Spock) and finished all the missions at the highest success. We had a good time though, and the theme is well implemented. If I try again I'll suggest playing in hard mode.

I'm a big fan of this oft-maligned game.  The components are quality and the gameplay is intense with lots of fascinating (pun intended) decisions.  Though the plot lines can be repetitive at times, I still enjoy getting the feeling of a classic Star Trek storyline of an away-team mission.

Eh... shoot me. I wish it was TOS themed all the same. It's fine, really, for what it is. Desperately needs expansions, and not just more 'clix' (trademark, copyright, cash-grab) figures - more missions, more varieties in play styles. You know, game stuff, not collectible minis. Oh, wait, haven't I encouraged them by buying in? Damn.

RATING: 6
rating after 1 solo play.  i could see myself having rated it higher if it had more missions/plots out of the box.  granted, i am a sucker for expansions, but, come on... maybe 1 more plotline in the basegame?  Star Trek.  Co-op.  Easy to teach/learn. Plays in an hour or so.  

edit after more plays... so, the wheels have come off this one.  once you have played it a few times, the theme flakes off and it just becomes another Knizia math problem to solve.  Very saddened by this.  If they had included more than one storyline, like a book, similar to Betrayal At House on the Hill or something, it would've lasted longer.  IT is a fun game to play with fellow Trekkers, but not more than a couple of times.  Spend your money on FLeet Captains instead.

RATING: 8
Despite the box art, the Star Trek iteration this game most effectively captures is the 1960's original. A co-op game in which 1-4 players take control of a unique character from the show, the structure of the game plays out like an episode of the show. There is a planet in trouble, above which the Enterprise faces off against a threatening Klingon "Bird of Prey." Spaces on the planet have face down event cards, which are revealed when a player enters the space. These event cards are either the next stage in the "plot" or a random event. What makes this game shine is the random events (such as "Kirk discovered with ambassador's wife") which really evoke classic Trek and the constant struggle between planetside priorities and keeping the Enterprise in one piece.

Downside: There isn't as much distinction in the character abilities as with other co-op character-based games. Only Kirk has a really essential ability.

After three plays I do enjoy the game.  I would suggest not starting with the easy level unless you are playing with newbies or players who hate loosing.  My first play at the easy level left me indifferent about the game.  It was boring, there wasn't much tension, and we easily beat the game and fairly well at that.  Since then, I've only played at Medium level and the experiences have been vastly different. The two games I've played so far at medium level were both exciting,had tension, and were very close even though we lost both games by running out of time. As with most cooperative games I own, I won't play them every week, or even every month, but they are wonderful for a few plays each year and with the Star Trek theme, I just had to have this.

A decent attempt at a ST co-op game, but lacks real direction or focus--just not much to "get into" here. Gameplay was flat and plodding and the scoring mechanism/final outcome is unsatisfying.

Complete missions within certain number of moves, with subsequent missions dependent on timing. Damage and abilities use the click system, which is easy to grasp, as are the rest of the play mechanics. But, sadly, there is only one set of missions, so the challenge drops significantly once you know how to solve them.

BIG PLUS: ease of learning, Star Trek theme
HUGE MINUS: limited replay because of limited missions

At first on some turns you joust with the klingon cruiser. Then you move around on the planet completing missions. This seemed like a mildly complex game of addition. Add up the value of your character, your crew cards, bonus tokens, your cards in hand, along with a die role. With a little planning this wasn't that difficult. I suppose if more time was taken to read the details of the mission and then use your imagination it might be more fun, but it would be closer to reading a book. One play was enough for me.

I don't get this game. It doesn't feel Star Treky (the lack of variance in the mission and the faceless planet don't help); the strategical variance feels small, and it mostly feels about luck.

First game, solo.  Liked it.  Love the theme and the theme fits very well.  Will see how it holds up after a few games, if the wife likes it I could see it staying at 8.  If she doesn't I would expect it to go down to a 7 only for the reason as the need for luck is very high in the game.

This is a Co-Op game with a Star Trek theme.We have played it multiple times and we always have fun.  The ending outcome is a score that you can compare your performance to previous attempts at the game.  The pro to that is you get to see that you are improving, but you really don't have that "WE WON" or "WE LOST" outcome, but rather "We did better" or "We sucked worse" feeling.

Great looking game (top notch components), but otherwise this is just a  decent co-operation which - I think - is a repetitive after couple of games. I haven't played a good co-operation game and that's still true after this Star Trek -experience.

It was interesting. I played with 2 experienced players and another new player (4 of us in total) and one of the experienced players did the coop no-no of basically telling us what to do instead of helping us learn what could have been done, so I didn't find it terribly enjoyable. I would like to try it again sometime with all people who know the game to see if it runs faster and is more fun.

Feels too dry and fiddly. There is a lot of adding up numbers. True, this is the case with other games like Arkham Horror also. Somehow it was more of an annoyance with this one. In our case the game did not result in a lot of Star Trek trash talk the way Fleet Captains does.

Agreed with some commenters that the game system is made to be easily expanded. It would improve the game if there were a few more scenarios.

RATING: 7
So this belongs to the general family of games (think ANDROID and TALISMAN) that allegedly tell stories, but can quickly collapse into mindless dice-rolling and card-playing fests unless players are really, really diligent about trying to get into the right mood. The mechanic whereby characters wander sort of aimlessly around the planet triggering what feels like mostly random events certainly doesn't help. But in the end this one kind of won me over. It's beautiful to look at, the clix figurines are fun to fiddle with, and gameplay does get quite suspenseful toward the end. It lacks the graceful marriage of theme and mechanic that sets apart Knizia's best work in this genre (LOTR, BEOWULF: THE LEGEND), but the space battle mechanic is undeniably clever. Fun enough overall to be a reliable winner with Trekkies, at any rate.

3/2014 Another co-operation game where you have to reach some goal within a certain number of actions while the game is throwing challenges and delays at you.  Well, this one is a fairly good one if you enjoy the StarTrek theme - otherwise, maybe not.  The number of stardate cards is very limited and makes the game somewhat repetitive.

I often forget how good this game is.  It tells a nice star trek story every time, and although the story is samey, it is still a challenge to get through and plays out differently enough each time to be interesting.  The downside is the fiddliness of the cards--you often have a large and unruly hand to manage and dealing with the cards can make turns take longer than they should.

slightly more interesting than base Pandemic, but less interesting than Pandemic with the expansion.  

neat application of the basic clix with dice, but almost makes some aspects more of a hassle.   

highly susceptible to "boss" players which is a flaw that co-ops for me need to address as once someone has a different level of experience, it breaks down as a game.

rumor that the first expansion might introduce an all vs one mechanic would be nice.  however, it still would probably be at most a 2 player game unless they revamp the base game a decent bit.

A solid 8. Rating could change depending on what sort of clever expansion ideas they come up with.  Great 'episode' feel to the game.  An "A" for presentation as well.  The cards are a bit flimsy though and need to be sleeved as they will undergo a lot of shuffling and handling. There is a lot of (easy) number crunching, which will turn off some, but for me that is all part of the fun of optimizing the puzzle. The rulebook could really use an FAQ or an index, there are a few unclear points.  One that has had to be cleared up already is that you DON'T reshuffle the energize deck when it is exhausted.

RATING: 9
I don’t understand some of the negativity around this game. I think that there must be an irrational anti-Knizia thing going on. Nevermind. The reality for me is that Star Trek Expeditions is a terrifically fun game. It feels like you are playing episodes from the Star Trek franchise. The heart of the story is about the Missions the away team have to complete. Working together cooperatively works very well as the system is simple, but with a number of varied choices that must be made with a view towards what’s best for the team, not necessarily the individual. The tension and pressure is high if you play the Red difficulty level but it can be very rewarding if you can win.

The system is very well designed and doesn’t get in the way of the narrative story and theme. The process is in the background and allows the theme to shine. Very nice indeed. The tactile feel of the game, the images and art, the miniatures all add to a brilliant experience, especially if you are a Star Trek fan. The balance of choices adds to the tension… when do you go up to Enterprise to heal and/or repair damage? How far do you push your luck in pressing to get the Missions done? Marvelous stuff. The game plays pretty fast and moves along nicely. Each turn, it will be a case of making the best choices to maximize your ability to work together to complete missions before time runs out or the Enterprise is destroyed.

If you are a Star Trek fan, you have here a relatively easy, yet challenging game and as a cooperative venture, you will have a great time struggling to complete the Missions with your friends.

While I'm far from the biggest fan of [i]Star Trek[/i], I do admire and own a kartload of Knizias, so I was more than inclined to give this game a shot. The many lukewarm to poor reviews I read here did give me pause though. After playing a few times I have to say that these reviews, while sometimes too harsh in tone, are generally on the money: the game often feels more like number-crunching than adventuring, the replay value seems limited, and the Clix-toys, with their microscopic font size, are mildly annoying.

Yet I've mostly enjoyed our plays and will definitely give it a few more goes, if only to learn to play more efficiently and to tackle the highest level of difficulty (we played all our games on the medium level). I'm tempted to add some variety with the three new characters now available, and would welcome an additional scenario expansion or two. [5 plays; gave away to a Trekkie friend]

Albeit this is a little on the "mathy" side, it is still highly thematic and fun.  It begs, crys, nay, screams for expansions (or mission packs), which would be extremely easy (seamless) to incorporate into the base game.  Do you think they were thinking about that when they released it? Duh . . .

I don't really understand all the hate around this game. It is entertaining enough that my group has played this multiple times. This is a fairly standard co-op game. I could see there being problems the more you play, as it could result in "memorizing" the events and when they're about to come up. Aside from that, it's great fun to have adventures in the Star Trek Universe.

On the lower difficulty levels, this is an easy and quite mechanical cooperative game. The hardest difficulty level is tuned just right: You always seem to run out of time when there's only one main mission left. 

Even though it's the typical Knizia math exercise, I like how the game encourages real cooperation. The graphic design is slightly too simplistic, a bit more flavor would have been nice. The same goes for the card and mission effects.

I'm usually the first one to get put off by bad usability but the usability complaints on this game seem to be somewhat exaggerated. The only usability issues I have are:
- The planet cards are thin and way oversized, so they will get marked very easily. 
- They did not bother to proofread the components.
- The structure and layout of the rulebook are amateurish. The [i]14+[/i] rating on the box looks silly when the rulebook is written for eight-year-olds.

The new Clix base is a huge improvement over the original version, and very easy to use.

RATING: 6
You're trying to complete 9 missions before the deck clock runs out. Completing a mission is simply rolling 2d6 high enough after adding on your base number. So the early game is building up your base (ie drawing cards that give you bonus modifiers). Then exploring (moving to a location to see which mission appears). Missions require solid bases in one of 3 colours, so have each person specialise their base in a different colour, move to a mission and roll well enough to complete it. You can waste actions healing yourself from deck clock induced damage, and also moving the Enterprise up the scoring track. You'll want to collect tokens from the exploration sites as they'll give benefits worthy of the action required to pick it up. The problem might be that each game has the same missions to complete ... the only variety is how and when they appear, which is random. After that, each specialised character has their job, go do it. There are some strategic decisions on how many base cards you'll want or need before you attempt missions (as failure causes damage). And also some discussion on how much effort you spend on score-building (ie helping the Enterprise). But there's not enough tricky things to do ... it's a matter of deciding what to do as a team based on the randomness that's been delivered to you and seeing if you roll high enough to do it efficiently or not. It's enjoyable enough to explore ... I'm just not sure how much long term replay there'll be after you've developed an approach you're happy with, as results will then be dictated by how the decks come out and how the dice roll.

Demoed at GAMA 2011 (without star ship battle).  Since publication, one play at each setting with full rules.  Seems a tad easy, even at the hard setting, with four characters.  Might try it next with three (leave out McCoy, perhaps).

Played correctly, much better (each player takes a stardate card, not just the "start" player)!  Now to try the harder settings with the correct rules.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
"Solid, but not amazing. The plot cards are fantastic, dripping with theme. Other aspects of the game are just mechanical. Ship minis are great. If you don't play too often, the repetition of the plot cards is not bad at all. We're up to 10 plays over 2.5 years, and it still feels reasonably fresh. However, an expansion with more Stardate cards and especially with a new set of Captain's Log cards would be much appreciated."

What I like:
- Plot really feels like a Star Trek movie
- Interesting mechanisms with the ship and planet
- Great minis

What I don't like:
- Adding up the modifier numbers over and over
- The Klingons are REALLY tough to start out
- Ship damage (for both the Enterprise and Klingons) makes it harder for you to hit the other, AND easier to get hit. Sort of "rich get richer". 
- I didn't like the scoring cylinders, so I bought octobox replacement parts


A good Knizia co-op. It has about as much theme as his somewhat similar Lord of the Rings, which is to say that it is both quite thematic and quite abstract at the same time. Adding up the bonuses is a bit of a nuisance, but not as bad as some games like Conquest of Planet Earth, or even Alien Frontiers, because in ST:E the bonuses come from the same finite set of sources that are relatively easy to scan.

There do seem to be multiple paths to victory, in the sense of focusing on the Enterprise vs. ignoring it, and going for side challenges or not.

I wish this had been based on the best series instead of the reboot movie. Of course by "best" I mean Voyager, although I know just about everyone in the world disagrees. For one thing, it's the only one that actually has a gender balance. It's a shame that of the first 7 characters in this game, only ONE is a female, and even her role in the game is quite a stretch from at least the original series (I haven't seen the movie).

The BGG weight of 2.3 is too low. I would give it a 2.6, slightly more complex than LotR. Our 2p learning game took 2 hours, but it usually takes 90 minutes now.

When I first started playing the game I was like, "Man, this is awesome!" After a half hour I was like, "Man, this isn't bad!" After an hour I was like, "Man, this is boring!" Tasks remain the same as the game goes on, giving it no sense of dynamic progression. It's just comparing numbers to other numbers and it is too long for such a simplistic system. If it was half the length I could see liking it, but as it is it wears out its welcome long before its over.

I love co-ops!  The clix figures are a really great way to keep track of stats.  I like how the main-story plotlines and sidequests work.  It tells a good story without sabotaging replayability.  The difficulty is that if you play it correctly, it's really freaking hard on "medium".  The last few times I taught it the group became very demoralized and I'm not sure I'll get anyone to play it again.  oops!  Other group members played it wrong the first time and it was way too easy.  So this might be a two player game that we can occasionally get Steve's parents to play.

A nice cooperative game. It has a tradeoff between accomplishing the mission and fending of the ship battles. The ship battles are daunting, but the missions don't seem to be hard. 
I like the progressive discovery of missions, and the text associated with the mission. That new missions are displayed but can't be acted upon until the previous of the type is finished.
Like how the different characters have different abilities, but wonder if a display would have been better than the clicky base - but it does look gook

Wow, tough game.  This is a game that can easily be played with 1 to 7 players (with the expansion).  The mechanics are unique in that there are not many games like this out there.  I really enjoyed it as it took a lot of thinking and strategizing to play.  There was also lots of planning ahead.  

There are many things to do without the fiddliness and I like fiddliness.  There are many different ways to lose so there are lots of things to work on to prevent that.  

I really enjoyed the game.  I would think it would be classified as a medium heavy game because of all the things you can do and must do to win.

Played this only once and was both disappointed and slightly overwhelmed by all the number-crunching, doublechecking of skills and so forth. Maybe I am old school and I understand that this is an 'Expedition' game but a Star Trek game that is not set on the Enterprise ? That just feels wrong and not thematic at all. The production value of this game is good, although the pieces sacrifice usability for style and some of the numbers in the Clix-figures and ships are really hard to see. There is some thematic mambo-jambo on the cards but those are just placeholders and I have rarely seen a thematic game with less theme or story or flavour for that matter behind it. We did not care for it and why would you. The only thing that matters in this game is numbers and colours you have to match and then roll a few dice here and there (Knizia anyone?). If this would not have this great license, I think people would not enjoy it as much, I know I would not. Oddly enough, I found this to inelegantly designed and shallow at the same time. Not my cup of tea. Also, replayability is not very high.

Co-op game that uses the Star Trek theme to great advantage (after all, Trek is an ensemble cast/team and the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, or the one).

The game doesn't look attractive either, but at least that's a good indicator of gameplay, because it's boring as well

But to be positive on one thing... I still like the clix system

15-06-2015. Rated after 1 play. StarTrek cooperative game. Sadly, fell incredibly flat in our game.

The game feels incredibly simple and abstract. You play as one of the figures from the series. First, you flip a card to see how many actions you can take, if the day tracker moves up or if the Klingons attack.

Klingon attack is simple, it moves closer and shoots. You roll a die, if the value of the die + value of klingons attack is higher than the Enterprise shield value, it takes a hit. Then, enterprise returns fire which works similarly.

The character then can take his/her actions, in which they can move, pick up objectives, beam up/down. On the planet there are missions and tokens you can complete. These are in the form of challenges. You roll two dice and add all bonuses you have. If this is higher or equal to the requirements you 'win'.. progresing the game and scoring VPs. That's it. BORING.

Admittedly, we tried our first game on easy which we shouldn't have. We saw that the challenges become more difficult to fulfill with increasing difficulty as the timer increases etc. Regardless, the game mechanisms are not appealing and it's just very abstract, mechanical and uninteresting. Massive pass for me based on this game, although I'd play a game on higher difficulty to see if that would change the game around although I do not expect it to.

Boring, drab. Yeah.Maybe

As far as co-op goes, this one will most likely suffer from the whole one person makes the decisions because he knows best that all other co-op games suffer from.

However, with one play it wasn't too apparent. Considering all the players were new and everyone gave their opinion and we decided as a group the best course of action. That's how co-op games should be and that made the game extremely enjoyable. 

Reading that they are planning expansions or mini expansions makes future of the game exciting. Where will it go? What will it add? What new things can I do? Whether or not I purchase this game will depend on how they decide to deal with expansions.

(1 play w/3 pl.) Nice new coop Knizia game. Interesting storyline and good components. This will hit the table quite often in the next weeks to come. 

Early impressions: as in most coop boardgames, it's more difficult to explain the rules to somebody than to actually play the game later on (in part this was caused by some opaque sentences in the german translation). It wasn't very difficult to win our first game (medium setting), but the low final score of 11 felt, regarding the possible plot endings, nevertheless like an epic failure. We simply missed too many deadlines and lost points because of that. The Klingon ship seems to be a tough customer, really looking forward to blast it into pieces next time! The Spock character seems to me the strongest because of his 'preview' ability that helps picking the right locations. If you are not a total newbie with that kind of games, you should start on medium difficulty. Although even on medium it seems like a challenge getting a really good score.

RATING: 6
I was very impressed by this Kniziatrash game. I think it captured very well the EuroFederation approach of resolving challenges, rather than the AmeriKlingon one of blowing crap up. You have a limited amount of time (actions) to accomplish your missions -- and you have to do them *well*, not just succeed. The flavor text is lacking on the cards most often seen in play (bad move), but the flavor text on the mission cards and even victory track is fantastic -- I certainly got the impression of the evil Klingons lurking in the background causing troubles for us!

I normally loathe and hate the Victory Point track, but they've taken an idea from wargames (Minor Victory, Major Victory, etc). Based on the number of victory points you receive in the Politics, Ecology, and Rebel tracks, it tells you the final fate of the planet. Our final results were that we transformed the planet into sustainable life, settled negotiations between the rebels and government, but the planet became moderately aligned with the Klingons! Those ingrates! Made me want to photo torpedo the jerks from orbit!

My personal annoyance are the starship rules. The Enterprise is *MUCH* weaker than the Klingon battlecruiser, and combat is, at most, potshots by the Klingons at the Enterprise. It felt more like a bully smacking the weakling every once in awhile, rather than anything remotely epic. Maybe that's how it was in the ST:E movies. Dunno.

So *my* verdict is that this is a must-have Ameritrash game for the Ameritrash Star Trek fan -- who wants to play the Federation. If you want to blow crap up, there's Starfleet Battles, and if you want to boink scantily clad alien girls, there's... okay, I don't want to know what game would do this sort of thing. 

*****

The engine is pretty good. I've played *many* adventure boardgames, and this is the first "pre-programmed" one, where you decisions at one point of the game affect the later part of the game. Most adventure boardgames have you wander around the board until the players get bored after overpreparing themselves for the end boss. STE has a timer, even for the encounters.

OTOH, This doesn't exactly rescue the game from being a bunch of skill checks. I'd pick it up on the cheap.

Highly thematic cooperative game from the everlasting Dr. Knizia. All fits together in the design, from the battleship battles, passing by intuitive and well integratics mechanics, to the different challenges that players have to resolve to win. A must have for Star Trek fans, as well as for colaborative gaming enthusiasts. The red level seemed almost imposible to win. I think that the game is thought to be played in the yellow one.

RATING: 6
Rated on one solo play on easy. Am not deducting points because it was too easy, but I felt a total detachment from the theme here. The game works well enough with the combination of dice rolls plus modifiers to complete challenges, and maybe a tougher difficulty level would have created more tension, but I didn't FEEL like I was in an episode of Star Trek. I felt like I was lumbering around a map adding yellow numbers to yellow challenges. There's basically no story here and with the way the game plays out I don't predict it would feel very different. Would benefit from a total overhaul of the cards included, the system works fine, now give it some theme.

 This is the first very "meh" game I've played in a while. It's... fine, but there's nothing really exciting about it. I know a lot of games have you doing basically the same thing over and over, but for some reason it really stands out in this one. I'm also not really into the idea of a co-op mainly being about how many points you got at the end as opposed to actually feeling like you accomplished something by winning. I'm not saying this was easy, even on novice, but I'm sure that after you get used to the game it really is about the score and not about if you can win or not. Not terrible, but I'm glad I didn't buy it.

RATING: 6
The game has some merits, with several branching story-lines, although the plot is somewhat convoluted and boring (in line with the show, not much of a trekkie here!).

Suffers from that distinct Knizia's incapability of designing really gripping games.

At a second thought, though, it probably suffers more from that certain pettyness that is often proper to the show. Where Fleet Captains manages to bring the universe to life in all its grandeur, this one focuses on unconsequential, confused, underwhelming local politics. Under the circumstances, it ain't that bad.

1 play, 4er, medium difficulty.

Not bad for a cooperative game, I guess -- the need for dice rolls to resolve problems helps prevent people from working out exactly what ought to be done next. But I didn't really feel the Star Trek theme. Rather, it was a lot of looking for specific colors and words (to match the required skills) and rolling of dice. There was pressure to do well, in terms of completing missions in time. But no real risk, and some things were simply impossible: by the time we found the mission, the randomly-drawn event cards had already marched us ahead far enough that it would be impossible to complete the mission before the deadline!

I did have a blast playing with the people in the game! However, if I were to be looking for a thematic cooperative game (and that would be rare -- I'm not exactly a fan of the genre!) I'd probably choose Defenders of the Realm instead.

Co-operative take on the Star Trek franchise. Nice heroclix miniatures (4 characters, USS Enterprise & a Klingon ship). Other artwork a bit drab. The game system works nicely - the guts of it being dealing with a series of planet-saving challenges which evolve tree-like based on how well you deal with each challenge. Three different types of challenge (& progress tracks to monitor) ensure no single player's skills can dominate the problem solving. All the while the clock is ticking and the Klingons are getting closer & closer to shooting the Enterprise out of the skies. First play & anecdotal evidence suggests its a tough act to make progress while keeping the Enterprise safe.

Fun first few plays, while discovering all the challenges and exploring the world. Isn't holding up well; not much variety. Click dials are annoying, though not as much so as in HC/MK. The startship combat is a really weak part of the game; fighting the Klingon ship is very dependent on really lucky rolls.

This seems like a "rental" game. Play it a few times and you've seen all its got.

I really wanted to like this game more than I do. It's an interesting premise, but it feels a little half-baked.

Mechanically it's very similar to Pandemic. The story mode for scoring almost works; the numbers seem very dry and uninteresting but the flavour text just about saves it.

With 5 it was also far too downtimey for a game of this level of simplicity.

I really liked this game, but my partner did not like it as much. While the core mechanics are rock solid (it's a Knizia game after all) the main scenario remains the same which unfortunately affected her enjoyment of the game. The game poses a real challenge, especially on the highest difficulty level. The "heroic act" move is very clever and thematic. The whole game has a very strong Star Trek feel to it, I am sure that the fans of the show will have an excellent time with it. For us it is a well-designed co-op which could have benefited from a more variable scenario setup.

A pretty decent Knizia co-op with Star Trek theme - and this time, believe it or not, it doesn't even feel too blatantly pasted on. A bit on the light side as far as these games go - it's more Forbidden Island than Battlestar Galactica, IMO. Still Good fun.

A pretty nifty cooperative game that even on middle difficulty level takes some fancy team footwork to score well. I was a little dubious about the use of Heroclix-style figures in the game (hey ... corporate says we gotta use more Heroclix), but the Clix stuff is pretty well integrated here. Which is a good thing, as that's about the only innovative element to the game. I love the theme and the game is solid, but rating remains a 7 simply because the game is absolutely going to require expansions to keep from going quickly stale. While the mission here has many moving parts, it's the same mission over and over, which pretty clearly is going to get dull without an infusion of new stuff.

WizKids hired the wrong game designer on this one.  Star Trek: Expeditions is one of Knizia's driest designs, yet it was set in a lavishly produced Star Trek universe.  As a cooperative, it completely flops.  There's almost no player interaction, and flavor text is limited to a handful of tiles.  The result is flat, inconsistent, and distant.  I feel like my favorite franchise just smacked me in the face.

Great deal on Amazon.ca. Was $29 so I HAD to buy it.
I love that the characters can stay on the enterprise OR beam down as an away team. That's very TREK to me.
I wish the game were a little easier/quicker to set up, but there are certainly worse. What's more, the value for the effort for setting this up is, to me, very high.  The more I play this game the more I enjoy it, even love it.  
The argument is that there should have been expansions. I'd love it if there were. However, I haven't yet run out of energy for this game and the deployability still feels high.

Good about the game: I find it extremely thematic.
Not good about the game: Set up and take down time.

Not bad, an enjoyable Trek game which is nice.  I really like the overall structure of the game, and it seems very expandable which is good.

Minor complaints here and there, but the biggest miss by far is the total lack of flavor in the event cards that are presented every turn,  No picture?!  No flavor?  I can't even get a title?  Come on guys... this is a no brainer.  BattleStar, Arkham, Pandemic... virtually every game with a "threat" mechanic gives you SOME idea of what problem/narrative is.  If a Red Shirt is going to die on an away mission, I'd like to know how he met his demise.

A very different Knizia game indeed. Except for Beowulf which is almost a direct port of Auf Heller und Pfennig with additional boards, I am realize that Knizia is doing a phenomenal job of adapting commercially themed games. Lord of the Rings, and LOTR: The Confrontation are both great games which I thought successfully incorporated elements of the story into the game. Same is true for ST:Expeditions. This is a cooperative game where players try to beat the clock by scoring enough points to win the game in various tracks. Besides the clock, a tension-inducing mechanism in the form of a Klingon bird of prey hunting down the Enterprise forces players to deal with protecting the ship in orbit while simultaneously solving missions planet side. The theme certainly comes through in this game as I felt that we were beaming back and forth the ship traveling across the different planets while solving the various crises. I was also very impressed with the heroclix components unlike all the negative stories I have heard from Fleet Captains. A good effort by Knizia and certainly an underrated game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
After 4 plays:

Very nice components. Very thematic, I like the beaming up and down between the ship and the planet. The challenges hold their theme if you put some effort into it but they can easily slip to collecting abstract modifiers if you're not careful.

I thought this would have very limited replayability at first but I'm finding it very difficult to do well using only 2 characters so the challenge is driving me on to more plays.

My wife and I really like co-op games.  This game requires a high degree of cooperation to do well at.  Many challenges will require more than one player to coordinate their efforts to accomplish.  All the while a Klingon ship is bearing down on the Enterprise.

The rules are straight forward and the components are top notch.  The cards are made of a strange material, but they seem rugged enough to me.  I don't plan to sleeve them, but each to his own.  The board looks much better in person.  lays impressively flat and the graphics are easy on the eyes.  There is a lot of text on the cards and attention has to be paid to the Captain’s Log Supplemental Cards cards as some of them effect you even if you don't undertake the challenge.  

There is a lot of theme here.  Not your typical Knizia design in that regard.  It feels like a typical episode of Star Trek (not necessarily the new movie version though as my wife's first comment was aren't we supposed to be fighting Romulan's not Klingon's?).  Due to the small use of event cards (6 of 16 per game) the replay value is higher than I initially feared.  Though, new scenarios would be welcome from this rich universe!

You take on the roles of Kirk, Spock, McCoy and Uhura responding to an invitation from the Nibian government to open discussions about the planet joining the United Federation of Planets. However, now that the Enterprise has arrived, you find the President of Nibia less happy to see you than the invitation suggested, and Mr. Spock has detected evidence that another starship may have recently been in orbit.

Lead your away teams made up of crew and resources from the Enterprise to solve the major story arcs plus key side missions before the Klingon Fleet arrives or the lone cloaked Klingon Battle cruiser in orbit destroys the Enterprise and her crew. Three difficulty levels, random side missions, player strategies and a unique branching mission tree ensure every game will be a unique memorable experience.

The rules are overwrought, which is annoying as it's pretty easy to play (there's a fair amount of handholding in terms of icons, etc.).

Like the face-up/face-down idea, and the "plot" really does seem like a ST episode. Wish the clix had been used to better effect (they're just a linear track, but hard to read). Biggest issue is variability: I'm really stunned that this is so obviously limited. Yes, you use 6 of 16 events, so that helps, but the core mission stuff will always be the same. 

But realistically, I doubt I'll play it often enough to really care. It's just very, very average.

Sci-fi clix coop Trek scenario. Action point cards and dice system to send an away team to the planet surface to make progress towards assisting the Nibian planet while at the same time not letting the orbiting Enterprise become space dust from a relentlessly attacking Klingon battle cruiser.  The objective tests and space battles have an Attack Wing feel.  So many game mechanics that I absolutely love; completely random seeding of planet locations needed to explore and advance the mission objectives (or threats) with random seeded tech items and followers, I love the single deck of event cards containing all levels of diffiulty effects on each card, diminishing capabilities from damage, random determined action points, random countdown timer of the captain log, advancing mission story lines with scooby doo outcomes dependent on degree of success. The different levels of success on three scoring paths is interesting, and throw in some ameri-trash luck factor with plenty of modified dice rolling. Simplified ship to ship combat to exchange damage without the need for maneuvering. A lot to like in this game. Even with all this goodness it can still get into a grind.

Very procedural game.  It takes some getting used to with its varying verbiage and processes and such.  After getting used to it though, we found it to be a cool game.  Cooperation is key.  In our first play, we were looking forward to coasting into a mediocre victory when the Enterprise was destroyed.  There are numerous elements to keep an eye one where failure in any one of them means defeat in the whole game.

Interesting adventure but the sort of game that I can play only occasionally.

This may be mathy, but still a very good game and overall engaging Star Trek experience.

decent co-op with a fair amount of Star Trek flavor.  however, it looks like quite it would only take a few plays to be done with.  definitely playing at the higher difficulty levels is a more rewarding experience.  board is nonsense, and card stock is strange.  figures are good.

Co-ops really are not my cuppa, but hey, this is still Star Trek. I just wish there would be more flavor texts around :)

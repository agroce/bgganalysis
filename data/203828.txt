That one really fell flat for me.

Cold War theme is long gone.
All that is left is an abstract tug of war card game that is not particularly appealing.

Really feel like the designers are milking the name.

TS light...same tough choices but in a 45-60 minute game which means it is much more likely to come out that TS itself.  Lots of tension with the multi lane defcon track as you balance your moves against the risk of nuclear war.

13 Days lite. Can Twilight Struggle -like gameplay be condensed into a 15 minute package? After playing 13 Minutes I'd say no. A little bit too opaque for its own good -- People searching for a way to kill a quarter of an hour usually tend to except something a bit less complex, and getting this back to the table after the initial bout has proven to be challenging. Iron Curtain does the same thing way better.

Multiple use cards provide an incredible amount of choices both in terms of where you put the card and whether you choose to put cubes on it or elsewhere. The win/lose end game is so tense. The only downside is that it might take a full game to understand how to play, but thats only about 13 minutes.

13 Minutes: The Cuban Missile Crisis is a micro game focusing on, in my opinion, one of the most interesting time periods. Gameplay was pretty straight forward, but I didn't get much strategy out of it on one play through. I ended up playing far to aggressively and ended up losing by triggering nuclear war.

What a cracker of a tiny game! Once more, Asger and company do not disappoint. This is a straight up distillation of the distillation (13 Days) of Twilight Struggle, and one that succeeds on all fronts: player decisions, model abstraction, economy of design, usability and teachability. Lovely and tense tactical game with undertones of strategic thinking, and many pitfalls and subtleties to discover. And all that with 13 cards and 13x2 cubes. Sheer brilliance!

A relatively fun and quick-playing game simulating the Cuban missile crisis.  Admittedly, it feels more like a Cold War theme slapped on some card-shifting and color-counting game mechanics—but that makes it sound worse than it actually is.  I can't see myself ever really taking the initiative to play this one again, but I wouldn't say no if someone suggested it.

Filler sencillo, quizá demasiado. La sensación de que se juega sólo y que no resulta demasiado temático ni profundo siempre está ahí. Sin embargo, como pasatiempo fácil de transportar y con cierta interacción (en irse pasando las cartas para el DEFCON), tiene su gracia.

Wasn't wowed by it, just a kind of abstract tug of war with a hint of flavor. But the game clearly succeeds in its objective to distill the TS experience even further. Looking forward to "1 Second: The Cuban Missile Crisis" where you just flip a coin.

Ok. Maybe it's my fault - I didn't even try to explore the game, but it seemed sooooo uninteresting and somehow random during our first game that I'm no longer eager to play it.
Maybe the problem is that just a game before we tried Hanamikoji, which is an awesome little game built with only 8 cards more.

An even more micro version of a CDG, one that can be played in just a few minutes as the title suggests. Creates dilemma in that the more Battlegrounds you dominate the more likely you are to accumulate the 3 Defcon symbols that trigger the game-losing nuclear holocaust. Hugely random, but for the playing time that doesn't matter. The only thing I don't think works is bidding for turn order (what if both players keep bidding the same, or one player bids all 13 cubes?).

Have played an early version of the prototype half a year ago at a designer meetup. Even then it was a very good game. I believe it has been improved since (don't know though). I think it's one of the best microgames I have played (if not the best).

It's a fast paced game that provides interesting choices all the way through. It gave me the urge to "play just one more game...".

Will update the rating when I have played it more.

Good tiny game that gets you thinking.
Tug of war based, and similar to Love Letter but with genuine choices.
Theme is slightly removed from gameplay, but it does recreate some of the CBM tensions. 
Nothing exciting, but would recommend if you want a short, strategy game.

This is neat! It really does distill the beating heart of Twilight Struggle into microgame format, and the 13-minute playtime is accurate. It's impressive.

The rulebook is a bit bumpy for the first run-through, but having seen it once I suspect that concern will entirely fall away. I can teach this after one play -- and I want to see more.

There's plenty of room here for analyzing the card possibilities, becoming familiar with the deck and the rhythm of the game -- and the cards -- over many plays. Depth in a game this small is really cool to see.

FUN: manages to distill 13 Days to it’s essence in just a few cards. Very clever.

UNIQUE: the interplay between gaining dominance and sphere of influence is quite clever.

NEGATIVES: the rulebook could have been quite a bit clearer. Obviously some theme got lost in translation.

As simple as a war game can get, you play cards to move cubes with a Twilight Struggle feel but for me it is just too simple and I don't really see a game here. You win by controlling cards with cubes and push the cards towards your opponent or yourself which helps to break ties. Again though, it is very simple, plays in 10 minutes (as per the name) but there is no excitement in my opinion.

Solid little micro game, and possibly my favorite one (I'm not the biggest fan of them).  I can see the game maybe getting either stale or better once all of the cards are known between the 2 players, but I don't think I'll get it to the table often enough for that to happen.

This is mostly an abstract game.  I find that the theme gets lost very easily.  There is no reason to even read the Event title of each card.  All that matters is placing or removing the cubes and moving the cards from one zone to another.  I try to remember to look at the event title on the card as I play it, but it is meaningless.  I basically enjoy the game, I just wish the theme came through better.  Some have compared it to Love Letter.  In LOVE LETTER, especially the Hobbit version, each card seems to have an identity of its own that makes it very thematic.  When you play the card you absolutely know the character and what it is trying to do.  Not so in 13 MINUTES.  Whenever I play any of the LOVE LETTER versions, with a new player,  Right after the first couple of hands I can ask the new player if he remembers the character of the cards, and "YES, of course.  The Prince, the Princess, the Priest, Gandalf, Legolas, Smaug, Bilbo,  the Ring, etc."  I try the same thing with new players to 13  MINUTES, and although they have enjoyed the game, and even play it through 4 or 5 times   - - -they don't know what I mean when I ask them about the cards.  "Well one, had 3 cubes available, and some were Russian and some American, and I remember something about putting a couple of cubes on two different cards."  Okay, but do you remember "Bay of Pigs" or Medium Range Ballistic missiles? or any of the historical events the cards were about?"  They look blank, and say, "What are you talking about?"

We normally don't like a lot of 'modern' themed games but this was an interesting looking 2p micro game, which is the kind of games we have been exploring a lot lately. It is very quick and portable (the box is WAY bigger than the actual game) and the design is clear. I was actually interested in the flavor text, which normally I don't like in a game since I feel they make cards look too busy/ overloaded. However, it works here. Reminded me favorably of a next level Avignon which employs a similar card sliding mechanic.

Twilight Struggle meets Love Letter, and it actually works. Like, they actually made Heavy Wargame: The Tiny Itty Bitty Card Game a thing and it's fantastic. Who could have guessed?

I recommend this game to teach people the basics of card-based wargaming - it's got all the things you'll run into, simplified.

It's also just really good as a filler for people who like that sort of game! I highly recommend it.

Cons: The end-scoring is a little tricky to learn your first time - it has lots of bits and pieces to remember. But that's par for the course with a game like this.

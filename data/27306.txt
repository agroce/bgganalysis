Build Venice and move your condole. Usually the efficient way is to leech in other peoples buildings. If you fall behind the game is unfortunately kind of lost, as getting back is hard.

Abstract. Very nice wooden pieces. Sort of a race game as you try to push your gondala furthest along the scoring track by building on the surrounding islands. The fact that the score track snakes around the board and your position on it makes a difference in how you score on the island you are next to i.e. you get gold bonuses, is very clever and something I haven't seen in many games before.

RATING: 7
Players cooperatively clear land and build buildings in Venice. A bit abstract but still very approachable with a mixture of mechanics reminiscent of other games (tokens - Africa; scoring track - Torres; cooperative building - Tower of Babel). At its core, it felt most like a more intuitive, more enjoyable Tower of Babel to me. Definitely SdJ bait as it has a very family friendly level of strategy (changing value of buildings throughout the game) and tactics (removal of swamp tiles, blocking with cities). There's also a nice level of luck in both the cards and the swamp/treasure tokens.

fun and mindless, but in the end a pretty basic game, of a regular card-game complexity. it seems with a group of experienced players everyone will play exactly same way, there seems nothing to explore, and the choices are a bit too obvious.  personally I'd change palazzos to 4, and campos to 2 to make the end result less luck dependent and the game a bit more balanced.

I must be Venice year again. See Ponte del Diavolo as well. This seems more of a "big box" game though and I already own San Marco and Doge. Production looks great. Need to see rules especially to find out how good the 2-player game is.

RATING: 7
This feels like an old school Euro to me. It has great wooden components, straight forward rules and good player interaction. It's a bit fiddly to set up, but the play is worth it in my opinion. I like anything Venice-related, so this was appealing to me right off the bat.

RATING: 7
I liked it, though not as much as [i]Die Säulen von Venedig[/i]. While we did see players fall behind in the game, it was possible for them to catch up. There seems to be a fine balance between when knowing when to complete buildings started by others and when to forge off on your own to score points.

I really like this one, it seems simple at first but there is quite a bit of strategy in it.  Some people say the board is bland but I think it looks great.  I play this on BSW alot.  

Hopefully it comes out in English before I break down and buy the German version.

Plays very well as a 2p or 3p game.  4p & 5p are ok, but the strategies are different.

Update:  Finally bought the German version!

RATING: 6
Klaus-Jürgen Wrede is often good but never great, in my opinion, so Vendig was good for a try. Not quite sure how to call it though. The pieces-parts, the tactics and individual mechanics are good. But I felt the pacing was amiss. There isn't a game flow of rising and lowering stakes, or a sense of drama. And the game seems to end half-developed. The other problem is that it feels rather similar to Tower of Babel, but that game is *so* much more interesting and gets the pacing and game development right. Not a bad game, but not different or good enough to rate a second play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nice game themed around Venice but could be anywhere really. Build Houses, Fountains, Palaces, Churches and Bridges in Venice to score points to victory. Clever mechanism for drawing cards and a darn it rule as you can't go back if you forget a part of your turn which has three phases. 2 Plays.

I liked the card play and how you build buildings.  I didn't like the wide wide swings of luck (circular tiles range from 0 points on some swamps to 6 points on some gold bags) or the way you jump people on the scoring track, which I think leads to a potential runaway leader problem.

The players use cards to construct buildings in Venice, which is one way of advancing their respective gondolas.
In addition, players collect treasure tiles if they place a building in a district adjacent to their gondola, and drain swamps to collect swamp tiles. Swamp and treasure tiles can also be used to advance a player's gondola. At the end of the game, the player whose gondola has moved the farthest, wins.

This game is a mixture of mechanics thrown together. It does work to some extent but couple of overlooked flaws let it down. Some of the cards are too powerful depending on when you draw them. And the "jumping over opponents in the scoretrack" mechanic just encourages a runaway leader problem.

Very underrated game from the creator of Carcassonne. Nothing special at the first glance. Than you play it for the second time and discover another layer of the game. And another.

Not a gem definitely. Nevertheless if you don't know Venedig, you miss a lot. It's a fine mixture of luck and tactics. And the pieces look fantastic :-)

After 3 plays: there is one problem - if one player jumps off more than a few points it's almost impossible to catch him. And one jump is very luck-dependant. So in the end random cards decide who will be the winner :-(

More to this one than meets the eye. The first game, we missed so many of the various bonuses and so on, that it was a wonder we played again. The second time around, we realised it was a bit more cut-throat, and the importance of gondola positioning became more evident. It'll be interesting to see how it plays with a full complement of players.

RATING: 7
Good solid game, with a couple of minor quirks:

Swamp discs have different graphics on their backs.
Who will be the first to memorize all the 2 point discs???

Also the rules dictate that if a player forgets an action (most often to collect Swamp discs) then the action if forfeited. This makes the game into a memory game, which is unsatisfactory to many gamers, and it also slows the game down as there will less opportunity to build. Players should remind each other of the task - and some of my friends even suggested that a player should be obliged to remove at least 1 Swamp each turn.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Interesting "cousin" of Blue Moon City*: you build palaces, bridges, etc..., by laying cards from your hand; if you don't complete the building (i.e.: play enough cards to do so), any other player can "help you" during his turn, and share the victory points with you. 

(*but no card effects here, and a random element with the swamp tiles, so this one's maybe even more "non-gamer" friendly)


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
There is a bit of tactics in choosing the cards to take, keep or play, but most of the time you are at the mercy of luck and the actions of other players. I find it most frustrating when I'm denied the option to draw three cards instead of one just because I don't have a suitable card to place in the pool. If scores are close, there seems to be a big advantage for the player who ends the game, as the others will often be stuck with incomplete buildings (worth nothing) from their last turn. I must also say it is visually quite dull. In the cooperative building style, "Tower of Babel" is a much better game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Played once on BSW.  Very nice constrained game.  Reminds me of Web of Power with the card draws, and trying to keep drawing 3 cards at all times.  Also a bit of Tower of Babel and Africa.  A little lighter than I expected, but very fun.  Just a nice game.  This is my early choice for whatever SDJ it's eligible for.

Edit:  Funny, I just read ludosophicus comments and it's almost exactly the same as mine.  So there you go.

Played a couple of times. At first glance Venedig seems derivative; the Venetian theme is well-worn in the Eurogame world and a number of the game mechanics are familiar. Furthermore the graphics on the box and board are not very attractive. On the other hand, the wooden components are rather fetching and it is a nice touch to score by moving gondolas along the canals. Where Venedig becomes interesting is in the tactical aspects created by the card-drafting mechanic, joint building projects, the relationship between the scoring track and possibility to acquire bonus tiles, and the mechanic of jumping over other players' gondolas. All of the aforementioned make Venedig a game of card management and careful choices over when to score. Clearly there is a fair amount of luck involved in the drawing of the cards, swamp tokens and treasure tokens - the latter two add an unecessary element of fiddliness. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Don't like it.  Very very random.

There are strictly tactical decisions in this game - you cannot work out and execute specific strategy.  Every turn you just do your best trying to erect (or participate in erecting) buildings.  And every turn in order not to fall back in scoring, you use all (or almost all) your available cards.  And at some point (towards the end of the game) one player jumps forward with scoring and wins the game.  And he jumps only because luck allowed him (by giving proper cards) to build a lucrative building.

I definitely want to try this one again, but my first impression was one of indifference.  I appreciate what the game is trying to do (especially with the more meaningful point track), but it seems a little too random and lacking in excitement to be something I'd want to play a lot.  The lackluster theme and artwork certainly don't help.

Played only on BSW.

A nice, light-middleweightish game that has a bit to chew on and a bit of tactics and even something vaguely resembling short term strategy to chew on. Possible I could burn out on it, especially if the randomness is a larger factor than it first appears, but for now I am quite enjoying it.

UPDATE: Okay, maybe I was a little overstimulated when I first rated this. A nice, solid 7 though, at least for a few more plays.

UPDATE: Has been superseded by newer shinies on BSW, and I haven't played in forever, so I'm going to drop my rating a point. I'd probably play if asked, though.

UPDATE: I don't think I've played this in over a year now, and I haven't missed it one bit. I could be convinced to play, but I feel no pull at all. 4.

When played as a FUN 2er, this game rocks HARD.  I mean, if you like to drop acid and hallucinate while you play board games, then maybe this one isn't for you.

I'm not sure why I didn't like this more than I do. It's got a few interesting ideas and it works well, but it just didn't wow me. One word of advice... stay with the pack in scoring because if you fall too far behind you lose the leap-frog advantage and you'll have no chance of catching up.

It tries to do too much.  Would probably have been better off if it were trimmed down a touch - such as by removing the random tile draws for drainage and for scoring bonuses by making them worth a set amount.

Relatively fun to play on BSW. Goes quickly - one of the eurofillers. I haven't seen much strategy yet, though - the luck of the draw and luck of the coins seem to make strategy harder. I have fun playing it, though.

Raised from 6 to 7. Relatively strategic game - plays quickly with players who have played before, but with a decent dosage of luck. It's no Puerto Rico, but it's good.

Five player game. Gorgeous wood components.

Has the mechanic where players cannot share spaces on the scoring track, so you gain extra points by leaping over opponents. Because so many points can be gained by this, if you have a very slow start at the beginning of the game, you're screwed.

Too tactical with not much tactical choices. Limited hand size prevents long-term planning.

Venedig -- Played once; three-player.

Some interesting mechanics, like allowing players to collect bonus chips when building in the district adjacent to their score marker, while the score track wraps around and through those districts.

Still, I have no desire to own this game.  I think it has to do with the discard/draw mechanic.  A player can only draw one card unless they can discard (face-up to the display) one card unlike any other face-up discards already in the display.  If they can do so, they draw three cards, choosing from the display or the face-down draw pile.  Too often I was unable to discard, so my hand size remained so small that I had too few options. 

That's not to say I dislike the game — I won't object to playing it if another player requests it.

It is an engaging system with fewer players.  Very tactical, but mostly compelling.  There is a high level of interaction, in that other people can constantly gut your position.  This could get mean quickly.  With too many people I could see this devolving into chaos where there is no planning as an option, you just score what you can and move on.  The two it works, but it didn't seem optimal.  

This has the Alhambra, poor get poorer "problem" in that if you can't churn cards you will fall well behind.  

It's a lot prettier in person than you'd think.

RATING: 7
BSW play only (4er).

Very interesting game, except the tile and card draw randomness might get frustrating? Would like to try it with 2 or 3.

--- Summary ---
Players first may play building cards, of several different types. Each building type requires a specific number of cards (1-3) and cleared hexes on the board (1-3). If the required number have been played (in total amongst ALL players), a build phase happens immediately: the active player chooses the order in which buildings will be built; each master builder (the player with the most cards of that building type) chooses the specific location. Players score VP based on type of building (flat 1 or 7 VP, # adjacent buildings, # adjacent undeveloped hexes, # houses on island). If their gondola (score marker) is on the score track, which snakes between the islands on the board, positioned adjacent to the island that just scored, the player(s) will receive a treasure tile worth 3-6 gold. 

After playing building tiles, they clear 0-2 hexes by taking the swamp tile present. These are worth 0-2 gold.

Any time on your turn (and at end of game), may turn in swamp/treasure tiles and score 1VP per 5 gold.

Whenever scoring VP, occupied spaces on the score track are skipped (like Torres).

Finally, either draw 1 card from the deck or the face up discards, OR discard 1 card face up that is not already amongst the discards then draw 3 other cards.

The game ends when any player gets past 60VP, or the last building of any type has been built. Most VP wins.

Enjoyable game that seems to play well with 2 and more. Not unexpectedly, the more players you add, the more chaos that can be present. I like the how the center pool of cards weighs on your decision of what cards to play. I also like that players will work together to build some buildings. Your position on the score track, where the others are in relation to you and which island you are near all need to be watched. Very interesting.

Pretty average game, and another building game in Venice. Has some nice gameplay, but suffers from some imbalances and a board where it's difficult to discover the best scoring opportunities. Bears some remote similarities with Tower of Bable, but is nowhere near as subtle and enjoyable.

Fun little game. I can see why it may appeal for SdJ contention. I got my ass handed to me severely in each game so far, but at least now I have the mechanics down. I think I'd fare a bit better in future games, but overall, I don't think it has long-term appeal for my gaming tastes. I am eager to see the production value on the physical version. The BSW interface looks pretty nice. With top quality components, it'll certainly be a contender for SdJ. A slight concern about difficulty in catching up from a bad start, as people further in front along the scoring track can build over spaces earlier in the track, easily preventing slacking players from gaining treasure bonus tiles for extra points.

Quite abstract, but with some interesting mechanics, e.g. the way the VP track becomes part of gameplay, the slipstream effect of the VP track and the card flow. Would play again.

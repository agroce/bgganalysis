+ The nuances of this game capture the feel of a formula 1 race quite well for what actually is a fairly simple game; Individualization through your car, driver, and strategy makes you feel different enough to matter.
- Some of the rules push this just out of the gateway category which kills it for certain groups.

RATING: 8
Very impressive game, an unique design that really got my attention. Using cards for making the movement doesn't put you feel exactly in the vision of the pilot, but puts you in charge of the management of the race in a macrovision. It is not a very easy to learn game and sure have a lot of strategies to struggle with the strong robots and against other fast players.

The robots are a great addiction, they simply simulate the laggers in the same way they put another level of difficulty in a game that you must beat the other players AND the AI of the game.

For those who like the macro aspect of the race with a lot of flags, safety car, weather, pit stop windows and of course the race, it is a cool game for you. If you like card combinations to make your tatics and collect cards and hold to make powerful combinations, it is a game for you.

The cards put you into another level of control of the race that dices usualy doesn't do, so this game sure have the luck aspect of other card games that you have to buy cards, but in the same way, put you in a better control of the situation than dices.

Amazing. Better than any other Formula 1 boardgame I have ever played, and they are many. This can be the ultimate design. Deep but flowing smoothly like a real GP and all aspects are in there. Great the BOTs cars idea.

Muy buen juego. Tiene alguna que otra pecualiaridad y las reglas de adelantamientos y doblajes a veces son confusas pero como juego en sí es un simulador excelente.

These comments are based on playing the basic game only.   R!F90 is a card driven game.  Cards played move your car varying distances forward and may also require tyre wear, a check for damage, or drawing more cards.  Hand management is quite interesting and gets more so as your car suffers wear. This game can give you a real feel of nursing your car around those last few laps; fritter away cards to pass checks or simply to go faster and your options diminish painfully.  Cars with different characteristics and a choice of driver strategies will both change your approach to a race. Robot cars play an important role in cluttering the track.  Lapping them can be problematic on a twisty circuit (Monza and Hungaroring both are), which serves to compress the field and keep races close.   On the whole, race games leave me cold.  R!F90 gets a warmer reception because it gives me plenty to think about.

As others have commented, the rules are not well written.  I approve of the use of illustrated examples, but here they are poorly done.  Production quality is fine and it is a good looking game.

A game with very complex rules which makes the chance of missing something very big (see also the video of the author Lala). We played the Hungaroring  with advanced rules and it took us about 3 and a half hour to play 12 rounds. A lot of time went into looking up things. Most of the others players aren't very enthousiastic to play it a second time, but I would like to play it a second time with less than 6 players. For a racing game it is original but it's way too long and not fluent enough.

While this 9 doesn't strictly reflect "always want to play" status, I feel strongly about the design, playability, and theme integration. The turn-to-turn hand and resource management is simplistic, but they combine with the board and field to create the tension of long term race strategy.

What a game system. Everything in for a motorsport game and  solo playable. Much better than Formule DE and other Racing games (beside SPEED CIRCUIT). I did not expect the depth when I bought it 2 weeks ago. So sorry guys that I missed you at ESSEN 2013 and 2014.

RATING: 7.75
First Play; I found the rule book very hard work. Categorical statements in one part of the rule book were softened or reversed for certain circumstances elsewhere. Unless you have a global view of all the rules there seemed many opportunities to make mistakes. I needed to ask a lot of questions here but luckily the designer was on hand which was appreciated.

Explaining the game is the next big hurdle. There's a lot to take in and players pounced on the obvious loose ends as they became impatient to start. The need to read up on the strategies and skills makes the initial set up very slow especially as you need to know the rules before making an informed decision on where to start.

Once the game started there was some AP to start but soon people became comfortable with the regime, however once yellow flags and lapping started, the game ground to a halt again as players researched their options.

The game was ended after 3 hours as people had to get home but we were only 2/3rds of the way through a short game. I think the first game must be considered a learning game. Once all players are au fait with the rules it should fly but fresh blood will mean an hour to explain the rules to do the job properly.

Overall its the best F1 game/ simulation I've played. It does away with the square counting in Formula de and the pit strategies and fuelling need careful thought. There is some randomness with the card draw but there are always options. I like it but you must pick your players, avoid those with AP tendencies and try to play with a regular crowd to avoid rule explaining.

A keeper.

After one play: Lots of fun, but takes as long as a Formule De race to play. The big difference is that the considerations in Formula 90 are more strategic, while those in 'De are more tactical. That is, pitting strategies, tire choice, driver skills, etc. all go into your overall strategy for a game. In 'De, gear-shifting, positioning, and cornering are your chief concerns. I was pleasantly surprised by '90 and hope more tracks are made for the game.

RATING: 7.5
Versión "avanzada" para jugones del formula D. El juego simula una carrera de formula uno (hay varios circuitos y habrá más en el futuro). Cada jugador dispone de un coche con diversas características y en su turno jugará unas cartas que determinará qué puede hacer el coche, qué sucede en el circuito y cómo serán afectadas las características del coches. No es una carrera al uso. A pesar de ser un juego de carreras, es un euro, con gestión de la mano y en ocasiones bastante sesudo. No es apto para cualquiera. Eso sí, deja muy buena impresión y simula bastante bien una carrera real.

This is an excellent F1 race simulation. Although you are passing cars for position, the "race strategy" comes through clearly with the different skills and pit strategies available. The card and resource management part of this game is well implemented and the robot car opponents work very well to fill out the field.

This game will shine as more circuits are added in future expansions.

First play so it would be unfair to rate it.  But being a long-term fan of race games where I feel the emphasis must always be that it is A RACE I feel that with the designer's aim for a good simulation the baby has parted company with the bathwater on this occasion.  The result is a cerebral game that can take its time.  If that idea appeals then you will enjoy it.

Quite fun but a bit long for what it is and with confusing rules on overtaking/lapping the rear markers. I liked the strategy tiles and the way that your car takes damage.

Update Sep 2016

Formula 90 is my racing game of choice. Both solo and especially multiplayer, it is a rich experience that balances very well luck with the means to manipulate it. The card management subgame has a lot of nuances, the different circuits need different strategies, and all in all this feels just right. 

On the negative side, the latest living rulebook is better than the printed one, but still vague and not on par with the quality of the game. Also, the solo game needs a bit of tuning, but this will come with Expansion 3.

Upping this to a 9.

---
Outstanding racing mechanics, that feel thematic without being too convoluted. The various card speeds vs. the resource spendings, strategies and checks are very well intertwined, and although the game becomes mostly a hand management affair, tension is kept up until the end. People need to speed their game to avoid overly long sessions. There is a fair bit of luck of the draw, but it is a racing game after all, so I'm ok with it.

The component quality is average, the rules are well presented but have a few vague spots that the FAQ clears up. 

A keeper, and one of the best, if not the best, racers around.

Incredibly well thought out game! The original rulebook is a rubbish read so you will have to use the learning resources on this website and watch play-through videos on youtube to understand how to play properly. Once you understand the rules, you will be rewarded immensely. I'm not really a fan of Formula 1 (as in watching it for hours in front of a TV) but as a fan of strategy games I love, love, love this game! Oh and it wipes the floor with the boring, luck based Formula D (no skill involved whatsoever).

Super excited that I was able to find this game. Just bought it. My prediction is that this game will register somewhere in the 7 to 10 range. I think the game itself, due to the racing/driving mechanics of the hand management system, will warrant a 10. I think it is that good. More than any racing game, it actually feels like you're driving, at least from what I have seen. I love dice rolling but not for a racing game. That's why I have been completely turned off to other games, including the popular Formula D. That game doesn't appeal to me at all. And unlike Formula D, Race 90 is a deep racing simulation. 

The only reason why this game might get a 7 from me is because I just don't know how often I will be in the mood to play it. It's Formula 1 racing. I have only a passing interest in Formula 1 racing or any kind of racing for that matter.  So don't know how often I will be in the mood to play it. That being said, I also bought expansion 2 for more track variety out of the gate. I do really like that aspect of racing and I think that different strategy for different tracks will really increase my interest for playing this game. I'm always in the mood to play Dice Masters, Eldritch Horror, and my GMT COIN games. There's really no such thing as not being in the mood to play those games. 

So with this racing game, we'll see if it reels me in like that...

Update: This game is outstanding!

Plays very fast! Feels every bit like a race. Play the advanced rules. They don't add much to the basic rules, which are already great, and help round out the experience.

I'm liking this game.  Not having dice is a big plus for me - far too many racing games use them, and they're not really appropriate, for cars at least.

The card play has some significant tactical implications, and with the advanced rules some strategic implications, too, as do the rules for how weather changes (very clever), choosing tires, etc.

Good, clever system.  If I have any reservations about the system, it's that I'd prefer more granularity in the differences between cars.  I'm also not seeing how one racetrack or another better suits a particular car configuration.  But that's just about the only negative things I can say about the game - overall, it outshines other F1 racing games by a good margin.

RATING: 9.5
Este jogo não me pegou pela qualidade das peças ou do tabuleiro, mas pela sua MECÂNICA, um fórmula sensacional encontrada pelo criador para nos transportar para uma corrida de F1 com tudo o que existe de mais bacana: Estratégias, habilidades, retardatários, atraso nas freadas, colisões, janelas de pit stop, escolha de pneus, saídas e retorno de pista, carros controlados pelo tabuleiro e o tão sonhado SAFETY CAR.

Aplicando um conceito de micro e macrogerenciamento, você se sente um piloto e também um chefe de equipe tendo que gerenciar seu carro por dezenas e mais dezenas de voltas. As pistas são diferentes uma da outra e exigem mudança de estratégia/habilidade e os eventos aleatórios (chuva, bandeiras amarelas e safety car) estão sob certo controle dos jogadores o que permite explorar estrategicamente esses fatores.

O único "defeito" que vi é seu TEMPO DE JOGO, que é grande (mas se comparado ao FORMULA D dá quase na mesma). Não é um jogo para fracos, trata-se de um game bastante complexo que exige grande aplicação tática, porém possui vários elementos que o tornam bastante divertido e descontraído.

Simplesmente SENSACIONAL para quem é fã de jogos de corrida!

Excellent Formula 1 racing game.  The rules are quite tricky in places, but once you get there, it's a rewarding game.  Really does feel like a Formula 1 race, unlike other games I won't mention, with nice mix of emphasis on car management and racing.  The advanced game provides a richer game experience, and well worth moving on to as soon as possible.  The only downside is that it is a very long game, running to an hour per player for a full, advanced game.

After several solo games, and two games with players (2 and 3 players), I suspect two player may be the sweet spot.  It takes a while to teach, and for every new player the game will go that much slower, which will hurt the game's reputation (especially for non-F1/racing game fans).  

Still, very impressed.  Every design decision seems to have some thematic justification.  Excellent game.

This is quite an awesome racing game.  Unlike other racing games which are about rolling dice and seeing if you eat the off-track, this one is entirely about hand and resource management.  The fact that there are no dice makes this a highly tactical game instead of a luck-pressing game.  Your decisions to drive fast or slow, reckless or safe, etc. are all based on your hand of cards and not the toss of the dice.  That's something special in the world of racing boardgames.

The major hit against this one, though, is that as a result of its tactical nature, it plays quite slow.  Even at a decent clip, you can chalk it to about an hour of game time per player; perhaps once you have some seriously experienced people at the table, it runs shorter, but without championship rules (I understand they are coming), it's not likely to get multiple playthroughs without something at stake.  To that end, the fact that there are only two tracks in the box makes it even harder to do that.

While an expansion exists - with more coming - this is a small publisher and their prices are therefore quite high.  As much as I would like to get the expansion, paying $70 for a board and a deck of cards seems ridiculous.  At least the base game comes with wooden disks, plastic cars, and plenty of cardboard.

That being said, if you are a fan of F1 - in particular, 90s-era F1 - you will appreciate the feel of this game.  Rather than simulating one lap over the course of many turns, the game instead takes the idea that one or two laps are being made every turn and position is changing over the course of time, just like in the real thing.  Thus, the point of the game isn't to be the first to cross the finish line, but instead to be leading the race by the time you hit the last turn.

In terms of decision-making, there are [i]myriad[/i] options available to you and tons of rules to go along with it.  The bulk of what players do is choose what cards to play on their turn, which determines how many movement points they can spend.  On the surface, it's simple, but then you have to spend points to overtake opponents, spend points to win a contest in a corner, or even decide to risk everything to brake late and zip ahead, gambling you won't go off track and crash.  While I wouldn't say the game is complex, it is definitely not intuitive and you'll want someone experienced at the table to guide everyone through it; the rulebook does not, in any way, facilitate smooth play.  If you're going to get this going, you'll want some of the player aids made here on BGG - it is the [i]only[/i] way to play; there aren't any player aids in the box.

A little faster-paced would go a long way to getting a "season" going, but if you have that racing itch and don't want it to be luck of the roll, this is the one to go to (or you could go Thunder Alley, which is comparatively streamlined, but also quite good).

RATING: 7
We only played the basic game and there were things I liked. Gameplay was fairly simple, but we had to restart after misunderstanding the rules on over-taking. Or rather, the rules weren't written in a way that made sense. This game is more of a sim than a game, but it works very well for what it is. We especially liked the robot cars and the way pit stops worked. I struggled to benefit much from the trajectory lines, but they're a novel idea. Everything else was good but I baulked at trying the advanced version.

I'll certainly play it again but it's not on wishlist to buy.

*** Played it again, twice as 2P, and then as a 3P game. Well, it's moving up on my wishlist. We played today with more of the advanced features, getting Skills, using flags (but they never actually triggered or we missed when then did) and using the black robots with 4 movement. They just raced out to a steady lead, even with pit stops we had no chance of catching them. So I finished third. The other races I won, but partly because the other player manages to blow up before the end of the race. In 4 races, he's finished once, and that was getting right behind me in the same section on the very final move, taking 2nd to my 1st place in the race. 

But the interesting part was when we played with a third player new to the game. He managed to finish second having been forced into a second pit stop, whereas I have got through 3 of 4 races now with just one stop. But he stuck solidly to the Balance strategy and managed to keep reaching trajectory. I kept to my plan of hammering the car early on to take a solid lead, take my pit stop and switch to Save Tyres and keep the lead. It nearly lost me the race this time.

It's getting to be more and more interesting. As we get the play down pat, decisions are getting faster and so turns move quicker. We're still allowing for changing mind though, as nothing is always very certain. And we've been trying different strategies but I think they really depend on which track you're on.

I'm still not sure I'll buy it, but I'm getting closer.

After two plays I can say that you have to take advantage of everything the track provides to do well in this game.  Just relying in the cards you draw is not going to get you on the podium.  The best thing about this game is that, so far, it is close enough to an actual race that it scratches that racing itch for me, something Formula D's dice rolling just didn't provide me (don't get me wrong, I liked Formula D, but it just didn't scratch that itch).  It is a fairly complex game, so much so that I'm going to wade into the advanced game slowly. This is possible do to the modular nature of the game.  The complexity is not a bad thing, as it provides you more control over your car and, to a lesser extent, the race. I can't wait to play this again.

Really interesting approach to F1 racing game.  The basic game is pretty easy (more towards Medium weight), though the rules are a slight pain to read, due the the writer not mentioning that each example is linked to the previous example.  Once you figure that out they are pretty clear.  Fuel and Tire strategies are well executed, as well as overall strategies on how you will run the race. These are interesting and different strategies are better for different parts of the race or your position in the field.  We are still learning what to choose.  The robot back markers are a clever device to allow the leader to both break away and to be wound in by other players.   Excellent game

New Thoughts: 
The updated 3.0L rules are much clearer and fix that bit of confusion.  In the advanced rules, the robots are not all back markers, the super fast black robots will give you a run for your money. You need to use your skills, strategies and track cards to keep them and the other players at bay.

After 7 plays my rating bumped up a bit. The more you play the more you start to realize that the designer REALLY put thought into this game.

After 11 plays my rating bumped up again to 8.5

This is currently my second favorite race game out there.

I am the designer of the game. Of course I love it.

RATING: 8

It turned out that the rules were not streamlined enough.. to explain even the base game to a new player was such a pain in the ass that i sold it.

Most annoying were the different kinds of checks, wich cards to use, wich to keep as your new target number etc.

Second to most annoying is the rule that you'd draw a card at the beginning of your turn.. that drags the game immensely.. you had a plan, it's your turn, suddenly you can think all over again.. We house-ruled that you would start with one more card & that you draw that card at the end of your turn instead.

Such a pitty.. because the game is good.

______________________
Fantastic game! As soon as the qualifying begins & the game starts people become tense and vie for positions.
Put on the "inFamous" Soundtrack from amon tobin together with a loop of some race car ambience, then cut the tension with a knife..
This game works perfectly for casual gamers with the basic rules, aswell with gamers applying the full richness of the advanced game.

The game seems incredibly well balanced, combined with the sheer plethora of options i can only fathom how much work the designer put into developing & playtesting this.
Components are top notch, graphics (especially from the cards) very evocative.
Did i tell you about the bots? Incredibly well (and easy) implemented, the fact that the players might loose to some superfast bot invokes the feeling that it's not just player vs. player but that it's everyone for themselfs.. very competitive.
The game is not cheap, and i'm glad it's not..

The (english) rulebook hasn't been written by a native speaker, that can be frustrating at times when read for the first time.

One of the best strategic games I played this year (2014).

While it's very strategic, it's also very thematic. There *are* quite some rules, but as most of these make thematic sense, it's not hard to remember them.

The randomness involved (which exists through card play and some "blind checks") never feels tacked on and you have a lot of opportunities to mitigate it. Depending on real luck is usually a conscious choice and you are not forced into it.

Minor downsides: it *has* a learning curve and is not casual at all, what "racing game" may suggest to some people. // The rule to take a new card at the *beginning* of your turn vs. taking it already at the end is not ideal as it increases downtime a little bit, but in our game it was still ok. Also: I found the play time for such a deep game still reasonable -- was 3h for a 5-player game with 3 new people incl. introduction + rules.

Great artwork, very good production values (plastic cards, thick cardboard), a beautiful and perfectly sized map.

Great!

Card-based movement, deep strategic elements, tactical choices, asymmetric drivers, tonnes of (modular) rules to allow for realistic simulation or lighter races... we love this game.

I've played with counts from 1-5, and it scales very well. Thanks to the 'robots' (automated enemy drivers), you're going to have competition regardless of the number of players.

Also, despite the BGG recommendations for age and weight, the 'family rules' variant included in the manual is incredibly accessible. My daughter has played this... I want to say five times now, and she just turned seven last month. She usually finishes around 5th, meaning middle of the grid.

An utterly brilliant game.

Rather complex game compared to other car racing games.

The game itself is fine but:
- I'm not a particularly fond of car racing games
- it's too long (and I played the short variant and without advanced rules)

A healthy dose of luck is thrown in too.

The rating should be at least 1 point higher but I just have no desire for the repeat...

Amazing strategical racing game. Wonderful simulation of an F1 race. For me, best racing game out there.

I wrote a review in spanish: 

[url]http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1199970/race-formula-90-resena-en-espanol-spanish-review[/url]

Things I like:

- Very well done simulation of a race: driver skill, race strategy, weather changes, choice of tires, management of your car (tires, damage, fuel), fuel/pit stop strategy.....
- Robots are that kind of thing you wonder how it is that nobody has thought before.... Very smart addition, they allow to play the game with a low number of players because you always have enough cars on the track.

Things I don't like:

- None

Rating based on a half-dozen plays thus far.  Probably the best F1 racing sim boardgame out there, and I go way back with Speed Circuit as well as suffering through a few plays of Formula De, which isn't that great a racing sim by comparison.  Really needs to be played with Advanced Rules for soft/hard tyres, pit stops, etc., only downside is the fact that the game is not modular, meaning you have to shell out more bucks for the expansions to get the extra tracks, similar to the aforementioned Formula De and Speed Circuit.

Race! Formula 90 is the extreme of a niche game. It's a racing game for hobby gamers who are also motorsports enthusiasts. If you are a hobby gamer and are very interested in motorsports, then the game is well worth a look as it manages to capture the Formula 1 racing theme like no other. If you are not... then the game is just very long and full of mechnisms that probably won't appeal to you as much.

Nicely detailed treatment of the subject.  I like a lot about this game.  I have two problems.  The game duration is too long, and I am not good at this game.

2017 - I have caved, and bought this game along with the available expansions.  Maybe I can now improve as a player.  

Our group played this 6-player.  While I had a lot of fun, the downtime was too much.  A lot of this was the fact that only myself and one other player had played before.  But I am thinking 4 may be the sweet spot for this game.  We ran out of time, and agreed to call the game at the top of the hour.  (Assume a rain cloud came in, and foreshortened the race.)  This worked out ideally for me, but if the game had continued I would have had to pit and relinquish the lead.

I am currently enthused, and have raised my rating from 7 to 8.

If I hadn't played Thunder Alley 500 (stockcar team racing) first, this one might have caught my interest.  However, despite the differences in the game, I found myself constantly comparing the two and wishing I was playing TA500 instead which is more streamlined, plays faster, and has you controlling multiple cars while not having to deal with robot cars to help create a chaotic race track.  If one prefers Indy car racing, this might be the preferred simulation.  I tired of the constant checks (of which there were several fiddly differences depending on the type of check) and was frequently frustrated that I couldn't find a way to pass that often since generally one cannot pass in the corners and brake lines which make up probably 2/3 of the track.  Some rules were also not very well explained or seemed not to be present - at least for the basic game.

This one came out of nowhere. It is a great racing game! 
The rules are a little hard to grasp at first, but given proper attention it plays out as one of the better racing games out there. 

The balance of control over decisions and the "luck" of the cards in your hand make for some nice choices each turn. I love the robot cars getting in the way and the pit rules capture the feel of having to gas/change tires/apply body tape during a long F1 race.

This one will be an investment but it is an ambitious game to try and get the feel of a real grand prix. From my initial play (of the basic game) I think it will succeed.

This is a expensive game, I guess it was not produced in numbers. I got it for a decent price thanks to a mass buy.

The components are quite nice, not ravishing, but very good, and the graphic design is good as well.

The less appealing part of this game is the ruleset. Now, there is a basic game, but once your past your firts experience with it, you'll want to add at least some of the "advanced" rules. The problem is that there are many of them: it's long to explain and it takes some time to get used to them.

I do not recommend the advanced rules for the first game, but some of them are not very troublesome and even if they don't change the game significantly, they add to it. Other rules (like the off road trajectory after failing the late breaking check) just seem too much trouble for the little they provide.

What the game really manages to do is to simulate a Formula 1 racing experience. You have everything: overtaking, late braking in curves, boxes, tire types and exhaustion, fuel consumption, overlaping, collisions and structural damage, etc. You even have some simplified bots that will provide a random element with minimal maintenance!

Even if there are minimal concessions to the game mechanics, I would say the theme is perfectly captured!

There's a catchup mechanism when overlapping that grants that the race is not over until the checkered flag (tested!).

Overall, it's a medium game, more tactic tan strategic, that will require many decisions, some thinking, and it's not likely to produce AP.

Il miglior gioco di simulazioni sportive che abbia mai provato. E' l'unico gioco dove la simulazione dura quanto (se non di più) un reale GP. Il motivo è che il gioco riproduce effettivamente tantissimi aspetti del Gran Premio dal carattere del pilota, alla strategia, delle condizioni meteo, alle condizioni delle gomme. Nulla è lasciato al caso se non la pesca delle carte. Giocone dalla durata importante.

RATING: 7
I've played the both the basic and advanced versions solitaire, 2p, 3p and 4p - game plays very fast - turns are very quick to resolve, it's just a matter of how long the individual player is going to take to decide what to do.

Even the basic form of Race! Formula 90 is a much deeper game than formula D.  Deeper, but it's still what I would call a fast and furious race, because the game play isn't horribly complicated and turns resolve quickly.  Even in the basic version you have some interesting decisions to make and some varied strategies to consider.  But, its not a horribly deep strategy game.

Once you add the advanced rules, the game becomes a bit more complicated but still plays fast and furious.  I have played the advanced version solitaire,2p and 3p, and found these added rules made the game a lot deeper - there are more decisions about how to use your cards.  Hand management also becomes deeper because you now have a set of track cards which you must acquire by performing certain combos.  Playing a pair of cars as teammates is especially interesting, as you must be very careful about your use of events.  However, I haven't used the teammate rules much.

All in all, the game shines in the advanced version, where the game really feels like a fast race, with lots of decisions to make and general strategies to consider.  Even the advanced game is no brain-burner heavy Euro by any stretch, but it's a pretty exciting experience.

Downsides of the game are still a fair bit of luck, strategy selection was less interesting than it should have been due to imbalanced strategies and game length.

There are features of race games that aren't all that interesting. There's generally nothing really clever you do, you just do the best you can, and they generally have a rich-get-richer issue, where the leader can race perfectly in clear air. But if you're wanting a race game, this has lots of things in it to impress Euro-hardened gamers compared to the dice-fests that plague most race games (such as Formula De). The game is all about managing your hand of cards (and their costs) and trying to match them to the bonuses provided on the track (for playing the right colour). This provides a nice tactical decision each turn. The other decision is in which turns do you want to race harder (multiple cards, higher costs), usually to overtake. There's oodles of chrome once you're race-hardened - contests in corners, flags, spinouts, and the like. The NPC-robot cars work really nicely, filling out the track and providing obstacles to overtake - but more importantly in the late race they slow the leader down when he's trying to lap them, which helps bring the field back together a bit. Not overly, but enough to provide warm fuzzies and some hope for the laggers. They also nicely provide a heavy traffic race for 4 players without having to resort to the awful "each player gets 2 cars" approach. I really liked the twist it provides for a pit-stop - go back X spaces and race from there this turn, and get all your resources back, rather than the game be hidebound to a map pit location. Worse thematically, fantastic mechanically. There was a lot to like in the game, but the genre inevitably pulls the ratings down a bit, because in the end it's still just a race game.

This is a wonderfully in depth game. The rules, however, are not the best. I've had a hell of a time parsing through them and even after a solo game and a 2 player game, I'm still not entirely sure I'm playing correctly. We're also only playing the basic game...which says something.

I have 3 issues with this game. The rules, which I've mentioned. I also wish there were more maps available as 2 just aren't enough. I think with 6-8 total maps, this game would be essentially playable for a VERY long time. The last and biggest offender is the layout of the cards. The icons are on the right side of the card which makes it VERY hard to hold your hands of cards. It doesn't feel natural and really should have been fixed before release.

An F1 game that at its core is as streamlined as a dice-less Formula De, while affording greater control over your destiny. One play with the Basic rules is not enough to judge the full game and I would be happy to play again, having been the only player to move up positions (I foolishly started last on the grid, underestimating the importance of the qualifying card) but at least that let me feel like I was 'getting somewhere'. The problem with this play - and it's not RF90's fault - one slow player brought the game to a crawl: I've addressed this issue (which seems prevalent to motor racing games) in a Session Report on Thunder Alley, if you're interested.

Excellent racing game. The passing mechanics are great (both in straights and curves), and every game turn is full of tension and decision points. While there's certainly luck involved in the card draws, it doesn't feel like the determining factor. This is probably the best 2-3 player racing game available thanks to the robot car mechanics.

At the moment, the best board game about racing cars I know. We (my wife and me) don´t like Formula 1, but we like the strategy involved on it, and this game is exactly that: an abstract "strategy-tactic-hand-management-card-game" more than a race game. The bad thing is that its component could be much better (and its price is high...), it´s difficult to find in shops, plays are long (90 - 120 minutes in "Basic Mode"; 180 minutes or more in "Advance Mode"), and the manual is not clear enough:  there´re lots of little rules very difficult to follow or remember during the Advance Mode. But even the Basic Mode is fun to play!! Perfect game for 1-2 players. Above all: an excellent game!!

Beautifully designed, with 'Erebus' Artwork. The second work of Gotha Games looks finer than the previous (1865 sardinia). 
The game mechanics are truly innovative and as opposed to 'Formula De' does not require dice.
The downside of that is a bit complex and longer game. A complete game lasts not less than two hours. 
Nonetheless every aspect of a car run is taken in account and the use of 'robot' players assure you the real feeling of the Race!

Played twice in basic mode. I like more and more, and this is unusual for me because sports games are not my cup of tea. In this case it's totaly different, because you can feel the control of the car using cards instead  of random dices, strategy and movement are under your control more than ever. Luck factors seems well hidden behind player choice. I liked robot cars management. Advanced mode seems crazy, but we will see...

Race! has a lot of rules - and I'm not entirely sure how much many of them add to the game. For me this tended to veer very heavily towards simulation rather than game but with heavy chunks of randomness - drawing only cards that required tires when I was running low on them - and failing checks with a high chance of success.

I wonder if I cared for motor racing whether I'd have a higher opinion of this, but that didn't stop me loving Leader 1: Hell of the North despite knowing nothing about team cycling.

My other, perhaps main issue, with Race! was that qualifying seemed to have a very significant impact on the outcome with the leader never really being challenged by anyone other than the next two qualifying cars (both robots) while everyone else stuggled to fight their way through the pack.

A racing boardgame for lovers of motorsports. A simulation of varied aspects of formula one racing, from handling to setup and strategy. Highly recommended.

A beautifully designed game that doesn't get too bogged down and flows really well.  Highly recommended if you want a good motorsports game with some solid decisions to be made!

Hands down the best racing game I've ever played. As with all board games certain aspects are abstracted and this one the biggest is pitting, but honestly it makes it feel like you are watching a race. Even though someone may be in the front and have the leader token, they might not have pitted yet and will need to do so in another turn or two. This game is brilliant.

Does for formula one racing what Leader 1: Hell Of The North does for road cycling - excellently captures the essence of formula one with management and timing of different resources and abilities, and a tight and exciting finish as cars are likely to be damaged with worn our tyres and running out of cards/movement options.

Fairly complex, even the "basic" game, with lots of small rules. Around 3 hours for "basic", "short" game with 4 new players; probably 2 hours for 4 experienced players. Only 2 hours for second "basic", "short" game with 3-4 players (1-2 new, 2 experienced).

The "basic", "short" game is a very good introduction, but the full "advanced", "long" game is where the game really shines with a lot of different options and increased interaction and more challenges.

No matter how hardcore and experienced you are, this is a game where you must do the "basic" game first to learn the core game play before you can appreciate the full "advanced" game. If you jump straight into the "advanced" game, it is likely to be a nightmare of bewildering options and rules, and lots of downtime and very long playing time.

-----

Thunder Alley is for you:

if you think racing is watching lots of cars whizz around a race track;

and if you do not mind massive downtime as there is very little to do between your turns;

and if you do not mind massive randomness (card draws, some of which are simply outright better and more useful than others, and event cards) and chaos.

Yes, you can play well or badly - it is mostly about positioning, but no matter how well you play you are still largely at the mercy of other players' moves which sometimes intentionally and often randomly screws you over.

Race! Formula 90 is for you:

if you understand that racing, especially Formula 1, is about both chosing the right strategy, tactics, positioning and managing and optimising the use of your resources;

and if you do not mind some "downtime" between your own turns although it is not really downtime as the are lots of things you can and should think about and plan between your turns and you will often feel you have too little time;

and if you do not mind some randomness (card draws, some of which are significantly better but balanced by also being much more resource costly, and calculated risk resolution).

You can certainly play well or badly, and that will almost entirely determine the winner or at least if you are in contention of winning, but a bit of good/bad luck can determine a close contest.


Thunder Alley is somewhat similar to Ave Caesar, Formula D and Top Race.

Race! Formula 90 is somewhat similar to Leader 1: Hell Of The North.


Thunder Alley is a light, arcade/action game and feels like watching a Great Crashes compilation DVD.

Race! Formula 90 is a deep, strategy game and really captures the essence of Formula 1 racing.


Thunder Alley is the racing game you would have expected from Steve Jackson Games.

Race! Formula 90 is the racing game you would have expected from GMT Games.

The game is a good simulation of a F1 race. The traffic, overtakings, the driver's differents strategies, the challange against the bot drivers. All these has been included. On the other hand, a 53 turns race takes too long.

Perhaps the best card/hand management driven racing game out there.  Excellent depth with the advanced rules and not overly burdensome when taking a turn once you have the basics down but there is a bit of a steep learning curve with the advanced rules.  Quickly moving up my list of favorite racing games.  I love the use of the robot cars in the race.  Their mechanics are well thought out and it's not a give that you'll beat them unless you do some planning, especially with the fast and super-fast robots.  They fill out the field nicely even in just a two player game.

Car racing simulation with card driven, point movement of cars around the track. The game incorporates every single detail of real formula car racing.  The dummy cars rules are streamlined and are a must have component to capture passing, pits and tight turn squeezes. Being so true to life comes at the cost of tons of special rule exceptions and playing long which my group wouldn't mind if we were hard core racing fans.  This is a great game but my group needs a lighter version.

Important to note: take out the original manual in the game and burn it. I can't bring this game to two separate game groups because of the horrible manual. This mark (8) is for the game with the updated manual which you can download here on BGG.

Another caveat is that this game is heavy. Even without the advanced rules there's some things that non-gamers will have trouble grasping.

All this said, I really enjoy this game because of the deep strategic and tactical choices you can make. It really feels like a race, where you can try to be efficient, aggressive, defensive and most of all, where timing your move correctly can be the difference between winning and losing. I will never say no given the chance to play this.

Superb game.  Really captures F1 racing for me with the varying strategies all seeming viable.  Fun with basic rules, but after my 1st advanced game just great.

Does have some fiddly rules but thematically they make sense.  A bit like Mage Knight to me - you pay something in the complexity - but gain hugely in how it all fits together.

I'm not a big fan of racing games, but this one is very good. I will probably raise my rating after playing the advanced game.

Racegames and strategy often you don't find them together in a game. Thunder Alley was fun but merely tactical, other racegames too often are just a step above roll and move. 

But Race Formula 90 hits a strategic note. It's true there's still luck involved, getting a diverse hand of cards makes it easier on you but it still requires planning in advance and management. 

Yes it's not the one who gets the biggest cards that wins the game. There's a good balance in the cards, when to play them is key. 

This game has options (configuring your setup, skills and strategies from the start) and decisions, together with some tactical play. 

In our first game we saw the player who had managed everything the best and had planned out the perfect moment for an escape in a late brake section win the game by a mile albeit he had started on last place. 

Is it without flaws ? No, the game has lots of little rules about robot versus player movement/contests... While the rules are absolutely clear it's just hard to remember all interactions correctly, so a lot of concentration is needed. The game is also a bit long (though it didn't feel long)

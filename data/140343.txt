RATING: 6.7
Fun to play solo. Will be playing with friends next week. Can't see it being great with more than 3 people. Having 2 characters each instead of one is much better I imagine.

Rule book wrong though. DO NOT move hour marker at end of the dawn. Only move it once you know how many move points you want to use. Makes a huge difference

Also needs reference cards desperately To make it an 8.5. Reference cards for the 4 finales too

UPDATE

Had to change rating from 8 to 6.7 as I have now played with friends. Playing multi player added nothing and wasn't very fun. Still a good solo game but don't bother if only playing with friends. There's much better multiplayer games out there. I'll still play solo over and over though

RATING: 8.5
Evoking artwork, very rich thematically, really good zombie game. Variations in play sequence between day and night gives you a break in an otherwise truly intense game. The board is magnificent to look at and very functional. You will need to reference the rulebook a lot as it has so many stages as the game progresses but symbols are used well and after a while it becomes more intuitive. Action moves from large map to zoomed-in on-location siege. A truly unique game. The component quality is good but not FFG grade, board is likely to warp early and cards need sleeving with plenty of euro-stye cubes but that keeps cost down.

RATING: N/A
This game cost $70 and had cubes for zombies and card board cutouts on plastic stands for main characters. Literally 30 more dollars and I could have gotten zombicide with miniatures carved from Italian marble and polished with angels tears instead. Hyperbole aside, I initially got the game with every intention of playing it. I heard that the play was interesting and liked the dead French whore meets mythos look of the artwork but ultimately I just never got around to it. I mean the story about a leviathan (cough cough Cthulhu) stirring underneath Venice and raising the dead to help release it so it could finally give everyone a bath was cool and all but the game just for whatever reason never made it to the table. I ended up trading it to someone who hopefully has given it a play group to call its own.

RATING: 6.5
I was super excited about this game, which I discovered thanks to the Dice Tower like probably many others here on the Geek. It had many things that sounded very cool: the different endings, the theme, the "third person shooter" feel and - particularly interesting for me - the bosses! Also a very nice touch is the idea of naming the characters in the game after the masks of the Italian tradition.

That being said, the game is not bad but it isn't also as good as I expected, because of the combination of the following 2 reasons. Even with the different endings (and bosses and characters) the game is really repetitive, because you are basically just removing cubes from the map for the entire time. This gameplay is also unfortunately combined with an exaggerated lenght of 2 hours, which makes his repetitiveness of picking and dropping cubes even worse. I've also some other minor dislikes about the graphics, especially of the main board, and the strange box size. 

Therefore Carnival Zombie is not more than an average game for me, that contains some good ideas, but ultimately it's not so fun as I hoped.

If this game took less than 5 hours to play, I'd give it an even higher rating.  Everyone loves it and often talks about playing it again, but it's a long game. Even so, those who've played it are always interested in getting it back out to the table. The rulebook is atrocious, but it is worth learning. 

The only reason I don't "always" want to play this game is the 5+ hours investment. Even so, we're never disappointed playing it.

RATING: 6.5
After a few plays, it seems as though a few random elements can heavily influence the fail/success rate. The nightmare event can be massively helpful or end the game. Items can go from "nice-to-have" to "Well I guess we're winning the next night!" And, in general, there seem to be a few balance issues. Adding more bosses doesn't seem to significantly change the difficulty of a night, for example.

Fun to play, but hopefully the second edition will fix some issues.

Rule booklet makes the game seem intimidating but it ends up being relatively simple in terms of mechanics. While the zombie theme is well beyond old and tired at this point, the game does a decent job at keeping the pressure on and forcing the players to work together and decide how to make the best of a bad situation. Unfortunately we didn't play this as much as we thought we would, so we sold the game to make room for others.

An evil, zombie-filled, Venice-based upgrade from Castle Panic that ups the challenge without pushing the complexity and difficulty into the stratosphere of impossibility. If you like Castle Panic but maybe think it's a bit too easy or you were catastrophically disappointed with Dead Panic you must give this one a try.

RATING: 7.4
The rules are far from perfect, and the game is probably impossible on the hard level.
This is a cooperative game from 1 to 6 players.
You move through venice in hope of escaping (by several means) or killing the leviathan (the evil one).
You can escape by air, water or through the bridge.
The game is divided by rounds, each round is a day at the carnival. Each round has a night and day phase. In the night phase you have to defend yourselfs against hordes of zombies, during the day the zombies disapear and you can move in venice, using the few hours left of day to gather barricades, to find items and survivors, and generally prepare to face another night.
Also during the day a location on the board submerges, so you can't pass there the night, and moving through it costs another day hour.
Finally you reach your destination and face a whole new game experience as each end cenario plays out completely different.
The 6th character is way too weak, unless he gets some survivors boosting his stats, doc pestilence is not a fun character to play, also his cards are pretty lame, he is mostly a character that helps other characters.

A Castle Panichoz nagyon hasonló, csak annál sokkal hosszabb, aprólékosabban kidolgozott, de még így sem túl bonyolult játék. Nekem élményben ez jobb volt! Nagyon sok dolog tetszett, pl. a sokféle menekülési lehetőség, és az hogy folyamatosan változik a forgatókönyv annak függvényében, hogy merre tudunk továbbmenni. Jó a rázoomolós térkép is. Változatosak a helyszínek és a lények, jól van megoldva a randomizálás is, nem csináltak 10 féle paklit, hanem 1 paklival megoldották, ez tetszik. A hangulata is jó, bár valljuk be a kerettörténet elég erőltetett:) Tetszik a 3 nehézségi fokozat elegáns megoldása (főleg az a rész, hogy máshonnan kell indulni).
Ami fura volt, hogy a saját paklikból alig valaki szerzett kártyát, egyszerűen nem volt rá időnk a menekülés közben:) Ami nagyon béna az a csonakra ejtett zombik... ez egy ügyességi rész, ami nem jött be:)

Összességében jó, és szerintem a piros szint jó nagy kihívás lehet, elsőre mi még a 2. szinten is elvéreztünk.

Quite simply the new king of zombie games for me.  Absolutely brilliant.. don't expect it to be anything like the multitude of other Zombie games out there, because it's just.. not.

Equal parts Ameritrash, Euro and Wargame combine with a great theme to make something completely unique. You owe it to yourself to track down a copy (although that task in and of itself is going to be very hard to accomplish.)

Admittedly this was written after my first game, but I can't see my opinion changing much.  Might even creep up to a 10 after a few more games.

The current version (1.0) has many errors in the rules and a large FAQ is needed for this game since there are many questions after you read the rules how to interpret them. The game is split language, since i have some italians friends i dont mind... But still it looks ugly. My version had some offset in the punchboards. Besides that the artwork is amazing!!!

This game is an excellent zombie survival game that gives you all you can ask for. The board is a masterpiece and brilliantly provides accessible information where you need it, just like a computer screen.

The game is not perfectly balanced, in one game you can have the luck on your side and have a easy walk to safty and in another the game hates you and you will lose. This problem can be avoided if you apply some house rule where you keep track of each negative card that you draw and each positive and make sure that you never draw more of the each positive/negative. Drawing only negative event cards during the day will make you lose on normal difficulty level.

The game is quite lengthy so be prepared for 3+h. But you could easily take a picture of the gameboard and continue the next day or so. 

This game reminds me of a distilled computer rpg like experience. You have different encounters, your character levels (gets new items and abilities). There are a loot of them in this game.

Some of the rules could be more streamlined but having no dice is a amazing achievement!

Currently this is my 2nd best solo game after Mageknight the boardgame.

I was really surprised by how much I liked this game. As a huge zombie fan, I was initially unimpressed by the theme and presentation. It just seemed so weird: an ancient Leviathan lurking under the waters of Venice who raises the dead? Zombies dressed as clowns? Heroes from the commedia dell'arte carrying anti-aircraft weapons? And, worst of all, colored zombie cubes instead of minis? WTF?!?

After playing a couple of times, however, the game is awesome. This is the game Dead Panic should have been. Each turn ratchets up the tension as the hordes grow and grow, while your characters get increasingly stressed, your barricades start to run out, and the city starts to fall apart around you. 

By far the best mechanic is the much-discussed "cube drop," which not only adds a hilarious dexterity element to the game, but really adds to the tension. The more stress your characters have, the more likely they are to bring everyone down with them, which means you start to stress out as much as your own character while dropping the cubes. It's one of the only games I can think of that makes the players themselves actually feel the emotional stress of their own characters. The end result is a brilliant mix of excruciating, nail-biting tension with raucous hilarity that few games are able to achieve. An awesome thing to experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A very good blend of Euro-type design and thematic integration that comes together for a well-done cooperative game.

Players are heroes trying to escape Venice through a series of tower defense-like rounds where various zombies and zombie leaders try to overwhelm the heroes who struggle to fend them off.  The heroes need to use their special abilities and items they find throughout the game to get the job done.

Between rounds of zombie fighting in specific locations, players move about the city of Venice, making their way toward one of several options to escape the city.  Depending on which path the heroes decide to take (or are even sometimes forced to take due to flooding that occurs in the city, forcing the heroes to alter their plans), the heroes will have to play one of several different mini-games to see if they ultimately succeed.

Overall, some very innovative ideas here (you'll love how success/fail is determined when killing zombies!), good theme, good game play, and evocative artwork come together for a solid package.

Fantastico gioco ambientato in una venezia Zombieee!
Cooperativo molto tattico e matematico stile tower defense, dove i giocatori dovranno guidare un gruppo di 6 agenti speciali vestiti come le classiche maschere italiane, a debellare questa malattia o a fuggire da essa nel peggiore dei casi. Gioco che prende una piega in più se lo si interpreta come un classico film trash con sciocche frasi ad effetto, con un contorno molto tenebroso e una grafica davvero accattivante. Merita di essere giocato!

Fun but I think it is hard to learn.  The rule book is confusing and needs more pictures and ways to sum up the steps to be done.  

It does give a nice feeling of tension as the zombies surround you at night and not enought time to prepare during the daytimes hours.

I have always been teaching this game to new players and it always seems to take 3 hours.

There are 4 different finales and they all have specific and unintuitive rules on set up and they are all different.  This is very frustrating, it is hard to remeber how to set them all up.  

The boat ending is boring and makes the game end on a flat note.  The bridge ending so far is the best.  The bomb ending look fun and looks imposible, I havent actually tried that one yet.

RATING: 6.2
I have to say I was impressed. This game has a lot of replayability.  There are multiple directions in which to take the game and multiple different bosses, items and obstacles which will not come up in every game you play.

A basic cooperative tower defence, it starts easy and gets hard quick.  There are different day (rest, recover, search) and night (defend, survive) phases.

It won't be everyone's cup of tea, given the artwork, and the rule book was a pig to read, but after watching a video we really got into it.

Very VERY cool ideas in here.
You really feel like the zombies are COMING for you! And that dexterity minigame, the pile of corpses? GENIOUS!

Unfortunately not so good translation job.

RATING: 8.5
Really enjoyed my first play of this (solitaire) despite getting a couple of rules slightly wrong. Zombies emerging from the lagoon and infesting Venice as you lead a bunch of carnival clad mercenaries in an attempt to escape the doomed city - I mean how are you supposed to resist a theme like that, and the game does engage with the theme very well despite the cubes and lack of dice.

Artwork and components are very good, although the English rulebook does have a few translation glitches.

Probably not a game for repeated, frequent plays over a short period of time but it will be good to pull out a few times a year. Personally I think it will suit 1-3 players rather than a player count more than that, just so all playing have enough to do - but that might just be my taste in co-op games.

The combat system might benefit, in terms of generating tension, if it was a little less deterministic, as it does come across as more puzzle than conflict, but it is a good puzzle and, following the 'combat focus' variant, that limits communication between players in multi-player, may well do the trick.

The dead-pile dexterity drop mechanic sound really cooky but works amazingly well - sort of a Jack-Straws feel to it.

So far recommended - only a few more plays will show if it stands up in terms of replayability, there is a chance that the opening turn may come across a bit samey after a while.  

UPDATE - the mutli-player needs the optional rule about limited communication between players to make the game more than just a group problem solver, but it is quite hard to enforce, and you need to exercise a lot of restraint to allow players controlling particular characters to make there own mind up what to do. So you really need the right group to make this fly multi-player and I'm not sure I would ever play it with more than 3. It might just be easier to play it as a group problem solver.

Would be interested in a variant in which each character had secret hidden objectives on top of the normal game play.

Probably the perfect tower defense game. No real luck, just hordes of things, some slight dexterity elements, and discussion with how to deal with the stuff coming at you. Sinking city pieces can ruin your plans and force longer travel times, meaning less recovery or equipment. All very cool. 

Killing the Leviathan is pretty easy, though it hinges on one character finding his holy hand grenade using whatever time you have left in the day. 

The rulebook itself is the only real detractor here. It's long, which is fine, but they needed a native English speaker to do the editing on this thing. The FAQ helps immensely.

I bought this a bit blindly (tactical game with wooden cubes and no dice => instabuy).

Turned out to be much better than expected. Game is very tactical and highly thematic.

Several phases of game with different gameplay make for a nice variety and change between high pressure and rest phases. It also helps introducing the game to new players, as not all the rules need to be explained to start playing.

The four different finales makes for a lot of replayability.

The use of components is cleverest I've ever seen and highly immersive: it's wooden cubes, but I litteraly saw hordes of zombies coming towards my refuge, breaking barricades to try to take a bite at me, and their corpses piling up as we killed them.

An interesting eurogame style take on the zombie genre. The pile of bodies is an absolutely outstanding mechanic that really successfully captures the fear of whether zombies will return or not, but unfortunately the game is almost entirely a tower defense game and the movement around the city is far too abstracted and uninteresting and most characters will not have more than one or two items (at most four or five) over the course of an entire game, which means the many cool items in the deck feel wasted. For anyone who loves tower defense, this is a solid game. Otherwise, don't bother.

Average cooperative game. The first part was fine, but the escape in the boat was an anti-climax. No thrill, too easy and obvious. Dropping the dead zombies on the dump is more challenging than expected ... but dexterity has never been my strong point.

RATING: N/A
In the cooperative game Carnival Zombie, players lead a group of characters who are fleeing on terra firma from the terror that has emerged from the lagoon of Venice. This group of characters must make its way through hordes of rotting "Infected" to leave the city, and players need to rush as the Leviathan upon which the foundations of Venice were built is awakening. Thus, it's only a matter of time before the city sinks in the dark waters of the lagoon.

Each game is divided into several nights and days. During the nights, players hide in trenches behind the barricades to resist the attacks of the Infected. During the day, players move through the city, which is shaken by tremors. The Infected are drawn by the groans of the Leviathan in the abyss to help their master free itself from the rotting stilts that nail it to the silt bed.

Players have several ways to get out of town, but little time to do it – and their path is hindered by the bosses, the most implacable servants of the Leviathan. If the players do make it out, they can assess their skills – and set a goal for next time – by counting the points scored during the game.

RATING: 6
Not bad, but for the most part seemed to lack meaningful decisions. We probably played it to slowly, which killed the theme for me. It is relatively easy to deal with the zombies if you have a lengthy planning phase before each hour - but I don't think that is hw it should be played.

At its core its a defense game seeing off different types of zombies / bosses from the arcs around the centre of the voard (castle panic,zombie panic etc) but this has much more to it - six unique characters with their own draw deck of items, a map of venice to move around during the day so you can plot how to win the game (3 different escape routes,an amory,and a location to try and kill the huge underwater zombie causing all the havoc) Players must decide what to do with their daylight hours in preparation for a nightly attack
Love this game - all six characters are in play so if you play with less than 6 you need to control more than 1

I rate it a 7 after two plays. First was 2-pl with our 10-yo and second was 5-pl with adults. The game is long; the 5-pl took 3.5 hours, rules explanation not included, and that was with a shortish boat finale. Perhaps playing time will be shorter with 3, each player handling 2 characters? I like the game, though. It´s nice to have a context.

I really wanted to love this game. I know that some people aren't in love with the art but I found it very impressive. However, this game was just not for me. Killing zombies felt like a repetitive task and the game was overly long for what it was. Also,because all characters have to be in every game, it doesn't work very well with 2 players. You never feel like you are a character when you are controlling multiple characters. I sold it.

RATING: 7
Interesting cooperative game that's a fusion of euro & ameritrash. Zombies and bosses move down sectors and through barricades to get at the survivors like in Castle Panic.  The comparison stops there however.  The survivors must get through several night rounds, when the zombies are active, before using precious day rounds to heal, move (on a strategic map) to an escape route, search, etc. Lots of negotiating and trade-offs with other players. There are a lot of interesting mechanics and sub-systems.  We lost early in turn 2 and I look forward to another try.  The artwork is also unique and fantastic.  Why isn't this on the Hotness?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Castle Panic for gamers. The replay value on this one isn't that high, however, which is my only real knock against it. Otherwise this is a fantastic cooperative game, and it's an absolute travesty that this hasn't seen a better distribution. I like how different each character feels, the pile of corpses is a cool mechanic, and the boss zombies are all very interesting. Once you've experienced each of the endings though, the only thing that's really going to change is the difficulty, which ranges from holding your hand to downright brutal. I'm going to hold onto this for the foreseeable future, but I'm hoping that a second edition is indeed in the works, and that it will completely eclipse this version.

Replaces Castle Panic.

Carnival Zombie is an exceptional game altogether.
The mechanics,theme,gameplay are all put together in such a way that one could not do without the other.
I believe many designers could take lassons from some games and this is one of those games.
It just works.
The gameplay is immersive and you feel like the survivors. the strategies and tactics during the day (to prepare for the night) are really thought provoking.
The art work is great,and the idea to make the boss cards and monster cards part of the board instead of generic cards,was brilliant!
A must buy and not only for the fans of the theme (I don't like zombie anything personally!!),this game is just a great game on it's way to a classic,reference game.

RATING: 6.6
The rulebook layout is from 20 years ago. The writting is not bad, but it could be improved. These 2 issues make reading it a hard time. But once you know the rules, it's much easier to explain them, especially when you ommit the different finales (after all, you will only play one of them, at most).

The components are a bit above average. I personally don't like it's art, but I think many people will love it. The cardstock is great, as well as the box (except the horrible insert) and it contains standups and cubes instead of minis. The cubes migh seem a downgrade, but they are actually a great solution, since you need to draw them at random from a box, and they are easily identifiable in the board.

[b]Likes:[/b]
-> The characters are and feel very different, their skills and shooting abilities are very well designed and they require clever thinking and coordination.
-> The tower defense part (the main one) is quite challenging.

[b]Don't like:[/b]
-> Long playing time and a bit repetitive.
-> Very lucky at certain key moments (sunken area, objects. A single card draw can ruin your game no matter what and there's no way to prevent that. This can be really frustrating after putting su much effort in the tower defense part.

Once you play a game and see the character items, you will easily see some easy ways to munchkinize your way to victory. You can still try different and more challenging approachs but overall, the game doesn't seem to have a long lifespan, especially because of its excessive lenght, much closer to (or above) the 3 hours mark than the 2 hours the box says. It's a good game, but I don't see it hitting my gaming table again.

RATING: N/A
A really strange looking game and a strange theme too! But the game is sound and the mechanics all work well together. The theme creates a fresh experience to tired zombie games and presents it in a new way. The Leviathan that lives in the water under Venice has waken and is about to devour the city. In the night time minions from the depths of the sea (zombies)are sent into the city to destroy everyone. 

The game board center is similar to a Castle Panic or Dead Panic setup, more so like the newer Dead Panic. This is where the characters will fend off the zombie attacks until dawn. The board also has a map of Venice, this is where the characters as a group will be moving through the city in the day time. Think of it like this, the characters are seen up close for the big battles and then you see them as a group traveling on a map from far away. 

But that's not all, the game has five endings that the characters might encounter or choose to pursue. You could try to escape the city by bridge, by flying out, killing the Leviathan, etc. If you survive long enough, you might be able to encounter one of these ending scenarios. Our first game we played the Easy level and just barely survived to get to the Bridge scenario. Once we were there though we had great success, except for one death.

Awesome co-op horror game ...beautiful atmospheric art work ...rules well ...the first thing one should do is go to file section and download second updated rule book and while you are there the FAQ file...but truely  worth the effort of untangling some of the rules ( translation issues really not rule issues) ... 

Six characters are always in play regardless of the number of players ...has several 'finales ' to end the game so loads of replay plus random draws each turn for the hoards ...so like forest Gumps box of chocolates you never know what you're going to get ...

Great effort from a small Italian publisher ...

Would have been a ten but for the rule book just took the total shine from that ten point score...

I don´t like the artwork. Otherwise main game was ok and there´s some tension when zombie hordes are closing in. The gameplay is pretty static though - no agonizing where to move.

After learning all the rules you will find out that this is a very interesting blend of cooperative thematic funny puzzle. Even without dice you will prey for the random events and placing of tokens to happen in certain way.

The dropping of corpses on the zombie grave make this.. quiet unpredictable and highly entertaining :)

The last part of the game was very thrilling in our group!

Plus the great price (43EUR).. I'll call it an Italian gem :)

The best game for 2 players I have in my collection.

Great, fresh mechanics, grotesque artwork, a whole campaign packed into 3-4 hours of play.

I'm not sure though it works this great with more than 3 players.

Update: After about 6 plays with 2-3 players, it suddenly became too easy even on hard. I wonder if there is still any replay value in it other then trying some different finales. Rated down to 8.

Pros:
Supports up to six players, cooperatively.
Tense survival theme.
Alternate endings makes the game different every time.
Awesome macabre artwork enhances theme.
Interesting dexterity mechanic is suprisingly fun.
Each player has an important powerful role to play.

Cons:
Really only suited for 3 or 6 players. 
Sometimes theme is lost among all the cube pushing.
Random encounters can leave players in a no win scenario.

Overall:
Carnival Zombie can be a bit difficult to get to the table due to the number of players it requires for balanced play, but once you hit that sweet spot this game is a clear winner. Definitely has earned a permanent spot in my collection

07-03-2015. Rated after 1 play. Interesting cooperative game which basically is a series of 'nights'  and 'days' of a group of people trying to escape a zombie-infested Venice.

Each night, your group of adventures is barricaded in and attacked by swarms of zombies, and boss monsters trying to kill you (or stress you out so much that you start killing others). During the day, you can try to heal, move through the city to advance to a new location with your adventurer special abilities. You then have to survive a second 'night' which kind of works identical.

I like the game. I really do. I think many of the mechanics are really nice. It's a fun cooperative game which feels different to me, than most other coops I have played. Components could've been a little better, especially the baricades are wood-color cubes in a game that contains white cubes. Silly choice. Rules are dense and hard to get into. But otherwise.. it's cool!

Carnival Zombie is a very nice game, but unluckily got a bit too much flaws to really shines.
First of all, it's considered a cooperative, but since, at least during the fights, there are really no chances to "fail" a action (fire and miss, for example), it's very easy for a seasoned player to detect the best course of action for all players, an to instruct anyone about it. In other words, CZ can very well be a solitaire game, and even if there are rules that should prevent a player to precisely told the others what to do, in practice it's completely pointless to enforce them in a cooperative game, where's half of the fun is exactly messing with the other players during a supposed deadly situation. Most of the discussions, however, are usually about the need to endure or not an extra stress to perform an extra action, an not much else. After some games, when the rules are definitely clear to all the players, the game is mostly an auto-play. I think that the addition of dices to resolve some actions could have make the game more tense and less "solvable". But whatever.
Even the "deadly" part of the game is somehow overrated, and it's mostly, again, a matter of chance. The bosses are completely unbalanced. Some, (mostly those who can affect the fight without the need to move, like the Doge), can lose the players a game almost immediately, while others are pretty much harmless. More to the point, if the players are able to place a boss directly in the scope of the sniper cause, during setup, they extract the card that allow them to do so, this is again something that incredibly ease the fight. Moreover, the fact that the fights last only 4 rounds often makes them anticlimactic, cause sometimes most of the zombies are simply unable to move enough and in time to become a threat.
The daylight parts of the game, albeit short, are actually pretty tense and that's when planning and debating with other players can become a factor, because there are very few actions available and all of them are usually very useful. Items and healing, however, are usually the top priority. The items are generally all good, even if some are decidedly more useful than others and draw them can again make the game way easier. The random floods that can make parts of the map unavailable can, again, range from game-deciding to meaningless (mostly the second, as the map is pretty big and usually the most vital points are just a few).
The ending scenarios are good, even if they don't differs that much from the basic fights. The most different one, the boat, it's completely luck based and stacking barricades is usually enough to make it a breeze. Ironically, the best is possibly the one that is always available, the bridge, as it's the only one that allow players to save themselves while leaving other behind (which is a very mean and fun way to end the game :D). 
All in all, this is a nice game, but is a bit too much streamlined after repeated plays and a bit too much on the luck side in favour of the players. I really hope that the next edition, that should be coming soon, can somehow make it better.

It feels like Left4Dead2 put into a board game. You really feel the fear as the zombies come closing in every night phase.
Plenty of room for discussions and strategy.
Plenty of replayability as the zombies/bosses, terrain and events are different each time.
Each character is unique and feels important to the team.
Playtime is a bit too long for me and the game requires some time to set up during each phase. However, it is fun and engaging throughout the gameplay.

A játék egyértelműen a Castle Panic mechanizmusára épít, ez van kicsit továbbgondolva. A játék 4 napból áll, egy-egy nap pedig 4 óra éjszakából és 4 óra nappalból. A 4 óra éjszak egy az egyben CP. A zombik a külső kerületekből megpróbálják bevenni a menekülttáborunkat, amit barikádokkal erősíthetünk meg. Lőhetünk távolra és közelharcba is keveredhetünk velük. Vannak kiemelt zombik, akik különböző képességekkel rendelkeznek. A 4 nappali órában barikádot tudunk építeni, használhatják a különböző karakterek a saját akcióikat és persze gyógyulhatunk. Érdekes ötlet a kis térkép, amin próbálunk a zombik lepte Velencéből kimenekülni. Érdekes a többféle lehetőség erre. Ezután, ha kibírtuk a 3 zombis éjszakát megpróbálhatjuk a végső menekülést, ami tulajdonképpen egy új játék a játékban. A hajós menekülés ötletes, jól kigondolt, de elég nehéz. A karakterek érdekesek, jól használhatók. Érdekes a kiemelt karakter ötlete, de ez sem újdonság. A játék 3 nehézsége elég erősen eltér, de jól eltalált, a normálon vesztettünk első játékra, de abszolút nyerhető tapasztaltabb játékosoknak. Az, hogy kockák a zombik tényleg sokat ront az összhatáson és a téma átjövésén. Nekem sok volt a játékidő. A szabály is 1 óra, első játékra pedig 4 órán át védekeztünk a horda ellen. A játék kicsit ismétlődő, az egyes éjszakákat ugyan megdobják a különböző épületek és főzombik véletlenszerű felhelyezése, de nekem még így sem nyújtott elég változatosságot. Ez nekem sok volt egy koop játéktól, a CP kiforrottabb egyszerűbb és nekem semmivel sem ad kevesebb élményt, sőt. Szóval én maradok annál.

Oh boy, this one was a chore.  I don't know whether it was just poorly written, poorly translated, or a horrible combination of both but this is in the top 5 worst rulebooks I've ever read.  The rulebook looks like it was made in Word and printed out in someone's home and the structure is awful.  It's hard to find general rules and many of the ones you can find are very poorly worded and explained (this one is probably the result of poor regional translation, one boss description is even entirely in Italian in the rulebook).

If you press on and play the game though I think it is pretty good.  It is like Castle Panic for gamers.  Players are in a central area fighting waves of zombies.  Each player controls a very different feeling character and the hordes of zombies are led by really tough bosses with special abilities.  After each night (which is when you fight the waves) you travel on a map during the day to achieve one of 4 different victory conditions.  This makes for some really interesting decisions, tense gameplay, and a good amount of replayability.

The biggest problem I had with this was the play time.  You always play with 6 characters so I wanted my first play to be with 6 people so nobody had to handle multiple characters on their first play.  Well it took us 3+ hours to finish the game.  Granted, specific players definitely took too long on their turns and it was the first play with a horrible rulebook that required a lot of Google breaks to figure things out.  But even getting it down to 2 hours is optimistic I think.  That's just too long for what this is.  It's deeper than Castle Panic but that's not saying much, it's not a super complicated game.

I want to try it again with just 3 people or so and see what the play time looks like.  I think with fewer people controlling characters it might go quicker despite having the same number of characters.  If not, I like it, but I don't think people (including myself) want to play THIS game for 3 hours so it probably won't hang around.

Interesting co op, great components, some innovative ideas, but flawed.  

I dont own it, i play a friends copy.  Weve played 2 games, won: 1, Lost: 1. Weve only done the boat ending.  I wish a separate board could have been used for the boat ending for more immersion (pun intended!).

The rulebook seems to suffer from translation problems, and we found a card error.   

It annoys me that the sectors and quadrants are called caves and something else i cant remember, really dosent make sense as we are supposed to be in Venice. And whilst i appreciate that this type of game dosent need zombie miniatures, cubes just arnt as thematic.

Definitely susceptible to the alpha player.

Fan.Tas.Tic. That's how you do a Zombie battle using Eurogame Mechanics. The Game is tight, but never unfair. It's challenging, victory is uncertain right until the end. You can choose among four different showdowns. Each showdown has different rules. It's like playing another game after the main game. Resources are scarce, you never have enough time. So the presssure is always on. Love it! 12 Points to Italy!

Extremely good game that is somewhat hobbled by a poor English translation and less than sterling components.  Major props for everything being bilingual Italian/English and not using dice. The artistic direction of the game is magnificently done by presenting the beings that populate Venice in classic Italian festival wear rendered in a figurative expressionistic style.  The characters have plenty of variety that make them feel unique. There are waves of zombies and plenty of killing to go around. Carnival Zombie really captures the survival scenario and with a few simple fixes this could be on my all time top ten games list.

I am no longer a fan of co-op games. I find them either too mathy, too random, or too limited with regard to replayability. Carnival Zombie is, however, one of the best games of this genre that I ever played. I would put it in the same league as Defenders Of The Realm. The randomness and mathiness is just the right level, and the atmosphere is really there. It is like Castle Panic for gamers, with cool characters and special abilities thrown into the mix. The manual is horrible though, and even though the revised rules are better, expect to be flipping through them regularly, even during your second game.

Fun. A little more strategic than Zombicide, because no dice, a little to long for what it is to my taste.
Et very nice upgrade if you like Castle Panic.

Frankly, not as good as I was hoping. 
Aside from the mini-board day phase, the meat of the game revolves around the night where the undead attempt to swarm your defensive position (ala Castle Panic). 
Unfortunately, the zombie popping just feels like a methodical efficiency exercise: character 'a' with the rifle does 'x' damage = remove 'x' zombie health.  No dice, no luck.  Alpha gamers armed with slide-rulers will have a field day.  
It just isn't that exciting.  The only real feeling of risk or pressure comes from the cube drop when disposing of corpses: any that fall off the tiny template are recycled back into play. 
I like diceless Euros as much as the next gamer, but I really think this game could've used an injection of chance to ramp up the fun.

Yes it's true, this is possibly the current best Eurozed games lout there. As co-ops go it's darn good. I'm a zombieholic with a wealth of undead games to choose from. This one gets a place near the top of the pile of rotting corpses. Perhaps not high enough to bury LNoE, but then again, that one's not really a co-op.

"I loved this game when I first got it, but nowadays I'm a bit neutral on it. It's basically like playing three games of Castle Panic in a row in some sort of campaign mode. It ends up becoming a very repetitive 2-3 hour long exercise of plotting out the most effective way for the six characters to kill as many zombies as they can, and then picking up and dropping cubes."

Co-op tower defense against a foul evil that has risen from the lagoon of Venice right during the middle of Carnival.    City board divided into quadrants of caves and ditches, patterned after Dante's Inferno.  Venice is sinking while the group of six carnival costumed heroes with special roles lay barricades and hold off waves of random seeded hordes of undead with bosses. Simplized combat keeps game pace. Mini dex game for returning zombies from the graveyard.  Heroes take terror and stress damage.  Three days alternating day and night phases to survive, search the palace, find the Holy Hand Grenade is a bit of a grind. Confront the leviathan in the grand finale to save the city.

Played once, did not finish the bridge finale. Coop games aren't for me and my group, I think. Such a shame, but I think will have to sell it.

Game category changed safely from [i]Want to Play[/i] to [i]Once Was Enough[/i]. The cube-dropping mechanic is inspired, so it's a shame it wasn't integrated into a better game.

Carnival Zombie is a three-hour tower defense prologue followed by a thematically interesting ten-minute endgame.  Cut the intro by 75% and you've got an experience that I'd try again.

Imagine yourself playing six consecutive games of Castle Panic and you've got yourself a close approximation of CZ.

Also, to call this a rules disaster is a major understatement.

Like: The different characters are all awesome and unique. You always feel like you accomplish something on your turn. The feeling of the horde drawing close is definitely present. The stress of the pile of corpses mechanic.

Dislike: Desperately needs an expansion. Some of the Equipment is overpowered, as long as you get certain things, it's almost harder to lose the game than to win.

rated on 1 game experience. 

For me this game lacks variety, time (one gets to use too little items), and actions. 

Played 5h game where I only did shoot 6 times. Too time consuming to be doing nothing at the table. 

Most time spent conversing with other members of a party, which, is kind of one of the main parts of a cooperative game, but did not bring me the satisfaction in general.

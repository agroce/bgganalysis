Falta, tardanza en la distribución de la edición en Español. Yo tengo el Kickstater con cuatro clanes y siguen muertos de risa sin abrir, Creo que el hecho de que en la caja básica te vengan todas las minis iguales y ningún clan tira para atrás, ya que si quieres algo diferente te tienes que esperar a que salga ti Clan a la venta. El juego puede que este bien y todo y que la mecánica sea sencilla que por lo poco que he leído y visto lo es pero el lio de miniaturas y clanes y figuras repetidas no tiene sentido.

I've loved the models from the Kickstarter, but have not been able to play the game with anyone in the year that I have had it. (2-2017 Downgraded to 6 accordingly)

Still haven't played. May keep the components for prototyping, but don't anticipate playing the game as made.  Still love the sculpts. (11-17 Downgraded to 5 accordingly)

Almost everything in this game is decided by random dice rolls that you have little to no influence over. This game practically plays itself. Even turn priority is decided with rock-paper-scissors. Boring.

Kickstarted it.  Have made it through 3+ games with the clans, shrines, lanterns, etc...

Well balanced, enjoyable game.  Not at all a slash and hack fest, but can rapidly devolve into one at times.  Dice canceling mechanic is straight forward and the potential effects are interesting and have made for some memorable moments especially when the attacker (4dice) knocked himself out against the defender (1 dice). The attacker rolled 3 spirits and a void, defender rolled one spirit canceling the void and forcing the attacker to pick the spirit result.

Right, first off, this ain't a game about ninja killing each other left, right, center, and off camera under the bleachers. It's a positioning game. Sure, the odd ninja will get taken down and sent to the Healing House to rest a bit, but mainly it's about completing the scenario goal while using forced movement, advantageous locations, and shenanigans generally to prevent your opponent from scoring points. Ninja are masters in the arts of the gang up and the dirty trick, and the bonuses for both quickly stack up.
Second off, the dice? Not a big deal. On an attack, each player rolls some, there's pairs of symbols that cancel each other out, and the one with the most dice (the attacker, unless the defender has pulled one of the aforementioned shenanigans) picks one to be the result. Something happens based on the result. Sound complicated? Well, if it does, there's a reference on the back of the rulebook, which is repeated on cards that each player gets one of, that makes it all perfectly clear. I memorized it all by the time I was done with my second game anyway.
But enough about what other people think, what's my opinion? Well, I do wish the Shrine Teams in the core set had point costs so they could be used in league play. As it stands you can only use them in one-off games where everyone has a Shrine Team, or as proxies for the Clans. That might not be so bad, though, as all the Clan rules are right in the rulebook, so you could try a Clan out before you buy its box. Just don't add any Oni to your team if you do, Shrine Teams are apparently not influential enough in the spirit world to recruit any, so they're only included in the Clan boxes.
That aside, It's very streamlined, after the first couple games spent working everything out. Play solitaire style, yourself controlling two different Shrine Teams, and you'll be ready to explain it to the rest of your gaming group pretty quick. Or you can just do that as a good way to spend an hour or so if you're a titanic dweeb like me. Turns can go pretty quickly, which then leads to rounds going quickly, and each scenario has a set number of rounds to it. As long as at least one player knows what's what, there isn't much risk of a single match unexpectedly ballooning into a four-hour drag.
I like the focus on adaptability. You can't go into an attack expecting to roll what you need to make any specific thing happen, you need to put yourself in a situation where anything bad happening to the ninja you're taking a swing at is strategically valuable to you. 
We can't really call it a Soda Pop Miniatures game without looking at the minis, can we? Ninja All-Stars has a chibi style to it, which has been growing more popular since Soda Pop's first chibi game: Super Dungeon Explore. NAS sports excellent designs, each ninja can be easily identified because the models are distinct and closely resemble the art on their reference cards. My favorite is the Clan Kitsune Oni, being a ten-foot werefox in samurai armor.
So yeah, Ninja All-Stars. In a nutshell, really, really good. If you like a game with a lot of tactics, positioning, and quick adaptation, I fully recommend it. It's not bad if you want a box full of chibi ninja either, although in that case maybe lean towards the Clan boxes in lieu of the core set.

I have been tracking this game for months and now that I finally got my hands on it I am thoroughly enjoying it. I have played the game three times with my young lad and it has been a blast. Game has awesome chibi ninja miniatures and contrary to the opinion of some I do love the dice mechanic and in particular how sometimes even if you 'win' the roll you might end up having to take a choice that will affect you. For example stunning or injuring oneself. This game is definitely a keeper. As a matter of fact, I just ordered 3 clans.

Ray. Edicion Kickstarter

Es un juego de enfrentamiento. cada jugador lleva un "clan" de ninjas y el objetivo es derrotar a los demas clanes. Se puede jugar 1vs1, o "todos contra todos" hasta 4 jugadores. 

Es de CoolMiniorNot. Autores de Super Dungeon Explore y Arcadia Quest. el que conozca uno o ambos juegos ya sabe lo que hay: un festival de minis chibis muy bien elaboradas, y un festival de mecanicas de juego que en ocasiones no lo son tanto. 

Este juego es quizas el mas flojo de los que he jugado de CMoN. No es ni mucho menos un mal juego. Es un juego de enfrentamiento y combate, rapido y directo. El tema esta bien reflejado y la edicion kickstarter trae material para aburrir al mas pintado (4 equipos "genericos" y material para hacer no se si son 6 u 8 clanes de lo mas variado). 

Quiza donde en mi opinion el juego falla un poco es que peca de lo mismo que le ocurre por ejemplo a Super Dungeon Explore: que no hay aliciente mas alla de repetir el mismo escenario forever and ever. no hay campaña, no hay objetivos en el escenario. solo enfrentar a los otros clanes y repartir mecos. No tengo ningun problema con eso, a mi me encantan los juegos de dar mecos... pero el juego no ofrece nada al margen de eso. 

Puntuacion provisional.

Had a chance to play a few times, very enjoyable.

Pros: 
 -Miniatures and components are very high quality.
 -Each player alternates activation for each miniature, keeping every player engaged.
 -Multiple scenarios are included, very different strategies are needed for each of them.  One may prioritize eliminating the enemy, one may prioritize positioning on the board and speed.
 -Interesting dice mechanic.  Each player rolls a pool of special dice, results cancel each other out, then the player with the most dice (successes) can pick a result based on what was rolled.  This usually means eliminating, stunning, or moving miniatures.  Player effects can change dice results, as well as cards each player can play.

Cons:
 -Takes a while to learn.
 -Lots of tokens to keep track of.  Not necessarily a bad thing - but it can get a little cluttered.
 -Lots of special abilities to keep track of throughout game.

Overall:
I enjoy this game, there is a lot of focus on stealth and model positioning.  The dice mechanic adds a lot of options, and the different scenarios allow for many different strategies.  Players can use a point-buy system to construct their ninja team, similar to miniature wargaming, which adds a lot of cool options all around.  There is also a campaign mode, which I hope to explore soon.

Battle system looks complicated but it is in fact really simple. The guy with more dice gets to choose the outcome of the battle, but the choice are not always the ones he want. Cards can also greatly affect the fight. I really enjoyed playing that game but mostly for the ninja theme. Playing Janken, shouting "void, void" when throwing the dice. Don't expect to play Catan, this game is more about throwing dice like shuriken than plan your 8th round.

A beautiful production with an interesting core design. Unfortunately suffers from some poor mechanics that run counter to the games intended fluidity.

I like the game, it is not so "boring" as many so loudly say. You get in a really tactical way when you use correctly the stealth, backstabs and support actions. It remembers me Blood Bowl sometimes, because an attack can even injure the attacker.

I think the main problem for many of the players is the abstraction point. You have to imagine the fight between attacker and defender, not just an attacker hitting and the defernder waiting without response until their turn.

Anyway, not the usual game we are used to, I really like the ninja stuff and the chibi-samurais within the box.

I'm still adjusting to the game-play, but the miniatures are second-to-none.  Love the variety and chibi style (another great set from Ninja Division), and how much was packaged in to reward the Kickstarter backers.  No KS exclusives, so also feel like my buddies can build a collection over time and not be punished for missing the KS.  I'm anticipating official balance focus from SPM, but other KS's keep them busy.

A beautifully designed game with incredible component quality, from the glossy board to the great miniatures. A simple game at its core, it quickly becomes more in depth when you use the special clans. The combat is a little weird to get the hang of and in the long run may need house ruling, but for now it'll do.

Artwork and modells a gorgeous and the rules are similar to Blodd Bowl (which is good), but often seem to be misunderstood in reviews.
Therefore it is much more about positioning, waiting for the right moment and luring the enemy in unfavorable situations.

Gorgeously thematic battle system and lore wrapped in a fiddly overall system. Get rid of da hustle by placing few shrines, sticking Blue tack for status counters and lining dots for LOS. As a tactical skirmishing minis game : cards, abilities, activation sequences, facing, supports and the combat system itself will let you mitigate luck way more than any other game in that category.

Skirmish game reminiscent of Blood Bowl.  Okay but a bit too slow and faffy for me.  Then again, I'm not into the theme at all on this one so if you like Anime and ninjas you'd probably get a lot more out of it than I did.

I feel the thing really holding this game down is the combat system. It is a bit too slow paced and as a result the game doesn't scale well. With 4 players, the game takes easily 2+ hours. With such game length, I'd probably opt for a different kind of game.

The minis, though? Simply fantastic.

Excellent game as a standalone board game, but even more fun in league play.  In some ways, the game can be a little hard to pick up for non-Bloodbowl and non-Wargamers, but once they start getting into the swing of things it goes by smoothly.

I am looking forward to getting the rest of the Ronin and all the other new things that I know will have to follow this.

Not a fan of this game. We played a three player game which I would recommend to never do. Everything about the game is completely luck driven from the dice rolling, to the card drawing. Combat is slow and clunky. I never felt like I was playing as ninjas in combat. It's a skirmish game trying to be something else and failing miserably. I'm glad I didn't back this one. The production is fantastic without question but that is the ONLY thing I liked about this game. Highly disappointed.

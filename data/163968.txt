I'd like to try this game again without using the Poseidon cards. There was actually a lot I liked about this game, even though it ended up taking a lot longer than it deserved based on its weight. But if there was no way to remove Poseidon from this game, I would never, ever play it again. Way too much "take that" for my taste, which I feel is a cheap and lazy way for a designer to add player interaction to a game.

As it is, I don't think I would want to buy it as I already own 7 Wonders and Seasons which scratch the same itch, but I would play it again if asked.

1 play / 3 players

LIKE: Lots of paths to score points. Super clever system of obtaining cards, and a clever system of converting an engine to final points. I liked the set collection and racing for sets, which kept some tension in the game.

DISLIKE: Lots of information to keep track of, from other player powers to who had which set. Mega iconography and tiny text on cards. It takes a full playthrough to understand how different cards interact and then understand how to value the cards. Some "take that" cards, but I barely noticed them.

OVERALL: It just felt like there was too much information to keep track of in the play-field. I think I could appreciate the game more if I played it more often, or if there was a starter deck that simplified the iconography. I was impressed with the system, but not with the engine-building aspect. Still a good game.

Really beautiful if somewhat abstract set collection game.  The column/pillar mechanic for claiming cards is brilliant, as is the pressure created by the game with the ability to use the power of cards generally only while they are in the Domain, but with the pressure to transfer those same cards to the Elysium for end-game scoring.  

I'm really looking forward to exploring the depths of this one, and hope they create more expansions.

Space Cowboys has had my attention since splendor. The designers are both multiple award nominees and the reviews and rules look solid. I like what I see. I played it for the first time yesterday and my initial impression is that it is living up to the hype. I'd like to play it a couple more times and adjust my rating accordingly. Elysium is turning out to be a pretty interesting card game with nice components and some cool twists on drafting mechanics and set collection, I like how there are multiple different God decks to keep variety and how you have to decide when to transfer your cards from useful game powers to sets of points.

Okay card management game.  Good components, but with so much text on the cards, it got a little read-y to me.  It also seems like you need to play a few times to make value decisions, as I still felt like a pig on roller skates by the end of the game.  Nothing that new, and not really my thing, but not a bad game.

RATING: 8
My first few experiences of Elysium were quite disappointing. I was expecting a tableau building game with awesome combos and synergies... but the game didn't deliver that for me. There were combos in the game, but they never seemed to click. I never got to take an awesome crazy turn... and I therefore was underwhelmed. However, later I decided to approach Elysium as "just" a set collection game... and that really changed my opinion.

I realized that the synergies are there but the game is more about deciding what card to pick and finding the right time to pick it. You have to be careful with the timing of everything you do in this game. These choices make Elysium quite a good game. It offers a very interesting challenge in relatively short play length. There's also a good amount of interaction. You are constantly looking at what the other players are doing. I really like this aspect of the game.

I still have a couple of minor problems with it though. For one thing, I really really dislike Poseidon and the "take that" mechanism that he introduces. I can play without it but it bothers me to have a completely useless god in the box. Secondly, the game really seems to suffer when the cards aren't shuffled well... you might get a whole bunch of cards for a god and never get what you need. Also, the game doesn't shine in two players for the same reason: it makes it hared for you to find the card you miss to finish a set. I find that frustrating.

All in all, however, I quite like Elysium. It's a challenging game that doesn't outstay its welcome and ends up feeling actually quite tight in terms of time. You always wish you could do a bit more. Yes, the game has a few problems but, once I adjusted my expectations, I found myself really enjoying it. Good game!

RATING: 7
1st play: the font on the cards is pretty small but the symbols make sense and with repeat plays I think it would become pretty easy to remember them. It's hard to do a lot of turn to turn planning, but the game plays fairly quickly. It seems somewhat AP vulnerable, because the game rewards planning four moves ahead each round, and yet someone taking your card can mess up your planning, but leaving you no good alternative. 

2nd play: The second time the symbols were less of an issue but the game can be frustrating as people step on your plans without meaning to, and if they do it at the wrong time your entire round can get messed up. This leads to trying to plan the entire turn bulletproof, causing Long delays between turns. If played at an appropriate pace the game feels rewarding, so playing with the right mix of players is essential.

What I like about Elysium is the four coloured columns that act as four different resources, or currencies if you prefer.  Everything you draft requires you to have one or two of them and to spend one, reducing your later options.  I haven't seen many of the different suits of cards, but I do like the way that each has its own character.

What I don't like about Elysium is the amount of open information.  Every card has a special ability that needs to be read and understood...and then re-read, compared to others and re-assessed.  Those inclined to analysis paralysis can also consider the future actions of all their opponents, because everything they hold is open to inspection as well.  

Beyond those things, Elysium offers some simple special power combo building and rummy-esque set collection, with some moderately interesting decisions about how long to carry on using a card's special powers before melding it.

For me Elysium is just an OK game.  I would likely enjoy it more if I was prepared to invest in multiple plays to familiarise myself with the decks, but there isn't quite enough to keep me hooked during that learning process.   

Production quality is very good.  The artwork is quite pleasing.

RATING: 7.5
Πάμε και στο πολλά υποσχόμενο Elysium από τους Space Cowboys που δεν θα ησυχάσουν αν δεν πάρουν ένα Spiel des Jahres. Πέρσι έφτασαν μέχρι την πηγή με το Splendor αλλά νερό δεν ήπιαν, οπότε φέτος επέστρεψαν δριμύτεροι.

Το Elysium έχει αρχαιοελληνικό θέμα αφού υπάρχουν 8 θεοί του Ολύμπου ο καθένας με την τράπουλά του. Στην αρχή διαλέγουμε τυχαία 5 θεούς ανακατεύουμε όλες μαζί τις κάρτες τους και ξεκινάμε. Το όνομα Elysium έχει να κάνει με τα Ηλύσια Πεδία, τον παράδεισο δηλαδή που πήγαιναν όταν πέθαιναν οι άξιοι ήρωες και οι ενάρετοι άνθρωποι.

Το παιχνίδι είναι πολύ απλό στην λογική του. Κάθε γύρα διαλέγεις μια κάρτα από αυτές που είναι διαθέσιμες για όλους στο κέντρο του τραπεζιού ενώ κάποια στιγμή θα πρέπει να διαλέξεις και ένα quest (ουσιαστικά είναι το turn order της επόμενης γύρας αλλά δίνει και εισόδημα) Οι κάρτες έχουν διάφορες ικανότητες, άλλες χρησιμοποιούνται μια φορά και τέλος, άλλες μια φορά κάθε γύρο και άλλες συνέχεια.

Με το που πάρεις μια κάρτα πρέπει να πετάξεις έναν από τους 4 χρωματιστούς κίονες που έχεις. Καθώς χάνεις κίονες περιορίζονται οι επιλογές σου αφού η κάθε κάρτα γράφει πάνω τι κίονες πρέπει να έχεις για να την πάρεις. Να σημειώσω εδώ πως οι κάρτες εκτός από τα εικονίδια για το τι κάνουν, έχουν και κείμενο για όποιον προτιμά τις λέξεις από τις εικόνες.

Με το που τελειώσουμε όλοι την πρώτη φάση τότε προχωράμε στις ταφές. Ανάλογα με το quest που διάλεξες έχεις δικαίωμα να κάνεις και τις ανάλογες ταφές. Εκεί είναι και το μεγαλύτερο κομμάτι των πόντων του παιχνιδιού. Θάβοντας τις κάρτες χάνεις τις ικανότητες τους αλλά μαζεύεις VP κάνοντας σετ από κάρτες με ίδιο νούμερο διαφορετικό χρώμα, ή με ίδιο χρώμα διαφορετικό νούμερο. Φυσικά οι κηδείες κοστίζουν σε χρυσό ανάλογα με το επίπεδο της κάρτας.

Όποιος ολοκληρώσει πρώτος κάποιο σετ παίρνει έξτρα πόντους δώρο κάτι που αυξάνει ακόμα περισσότερο τον ανταγωνισμό μεταξύ των παικτών. Επίσης πολλά abilities (ειδικά του Ποσειδώνα) σου επιτρέπουν να χτυπήσεις τους αντιπάλους. Να προσθέσω πως τους χτυπάς όλους, δεν κάνεις στοχευμένες επιθέσεις. Προσωπικά το προτιμώ έτσι στα παιχνίδια. Άλλωστε το kingmaking δεν έχει θέση σε eurogames. 

Μας πήρε συνολικά λίγο πάνω από μια ώρα για μια παρτίδα. Το artwork είναι συμπαθητικό, με διαφορετικό artist για κάθε τράπουλα θεού. Δείχνει να έχει αρκετό replayability αφού κάθε φορά παίζουν μόνο οι 5 από τους 8 θεούς. Μέχρι και το insert είναι καλοφτιαγμένο και θυμίζει αρχαίο ναό. Επίσης χρησιμοποίησαν διαφορετικό ζωγράφο για την τράπουλα του κάθε θεού. Γενικά προσεγμένη παραγωγή με προσοχή στη λεπτομέρια. cool:
Συνολικά μου άρεσε αφού σου δίνει να σκεφτείς πράματα. Ποιες κάρτες θα ήθελες, με ποια σειρά θα τις πάρεις, ποιον κίονα να πετάξεις κάθε φορά, τι κάνουν οι αντίπαλοι, πότε να επιλέξεις quest, πόσες κηδείες χρειάζεσαι, ποιο quest να πάρεις, με τι σειρά θα θάψεις τις κάρτες σου, θα προλάβεις να κάνεις πρώτος το σετ για τους μπόνους πόντους, από χρήματα πως πάμε, είσαι προετοιμασμένος για τις επιθέσεις των υπολοίπων και μπλα μπλα

Στα μειονεκτήματα να βάλω το γεγονός πως το θέμα είναι απλά pasted-on, ενώ έχω ακούσει και παράπονα πως δεν παίζει και τόσο καλά με μόνο 2 άτομα. Δεν το δοκίμασα οπότε δεν μπορώ να εκφέρω άποψη πάντως είναι σίγουρο πως με μόνο 2 άτομα θα εμφανιστούν λιγότερες κάρτες οπότε είναι πολύ πιθανό κάποια χρώματα/νούμερα να είναι πιο σπάνια.

Πολύ καλό παιχνίδι με απλούς κανόνες και αξιόλογο βάθος επιλογών. Θα αρέσει στους φίλους των καρτοπαιχνιδων με ικανότητες και combos. Για να δούμε αν θα καταφέρει φέτος να σπάσει το γερμανικό λόμπι.

Mildly entertaining.  A mishmash of mechanics.  It plays  very smoothly, but at 60+ minutes playing time, wears out its welcome about halfway through.  The entire time I was playing, I was just thinking of other games that it reminded me of.  The card powers interact in interesting ways; however, that first turn is brutal when all the cards, costs, prices, sets etc. have to be analyzed to make the opening move.  It is a very light, simple game disguised as a medium/heavy euro.

We really love this game. It is all about how you optimize and synergize your cards to get sets, and consiquently points.  It's always hard to chose when to drop cards, and therefore lose their abilities. Great game and we would love to get more cards in an expansion...but it seems that won't be happening. This game seems to have been lost in the crowd, which is a shame. A real gem I don't see leaving our collection any time soon.

This is a clever and enjoyable game.  I enjoyed the card selection mechanic with its linkage to color markers one has in possession at the time of selection.  Would be willing to play again and see how each game plays out.  I have an inkling of concern about replayability in the long term, but the use of different decks, and deck combinations, perhaps, allays these concerns.

I like the concept of drafting the cards into your domain which allows you to activate the card's abilities, but needing to transfer them to your Elysium in order to score points. This can lead to interesting decisions of whether to rush for set collection bonus points or use the card abilities multiple times per game.

If you're not familiar with the decks, there's definitely a lot of randomness that you can't prepare for and a lot of reading you have to do each turn to understand all the cards that come out.

This is a solid game and a pleasant surprise.  The game play is a mix of the familiar - a little bit action selection (in the "god columns"), a whole bit of drafting (in the card picks), set collection (in promoting cards to Elysium), and a bit of the random setup (in which god decks are in play).  The game was not one that drew me in by description. It's a little bit mechanism salad, but the actual game play was engaging and the mix of the elements felt balanced.  This is one to try before deciding on.

A truly sleek, wonderful design here. You'll shuffle up 5 of 8 potential families of cards (each representing a different Greek god), with some of them bringing in new mechanics to a game, and right out of the box you won't be playing two games quite the same for awhile. Purchase cards from the Agora into your Domain, and then transfer them to Elysium where you'll put together various scoring sets, not only for the set points, but also to attract Bonus tokens that can give you even MORE points. Wild cards factor in, and the different card powers are all fairly intuitive to understand. Space Cowboys does it again, this is easily superior to Splendor. Hope they will expand it for more Gods.

Quite disappointing. While the game certainly has nice ideas (available actions), it suffers from really boring and sometimes frustrating gameplay. Here, take on gold, there, move this down, bla bla. While it does work, it is not interesting - most actions (not just the VP-only ones) simply lack exciting effects. 

Also, the game should get an award for the worst application of a theme ever. The nice design and all the illustrations (which aren't spectacular if you look closely) do not help there.

Using a relatively simple rule set, the game manages to create a tense and brain-burning experience. From the start of each round, players are bombarded with useful information and numerous choices. And as the round progresses, those choices slowly become less numerous, which creates tension as players compete for specific cards. But one must be careful about limiting one's options, as this game can be quite brutal if don't plan ahead. Overall, I'm liking this game quite a lot. While I suspect the randomness is influential, especially with acquiring certain sets/combos, there are so many options at the start of each round that not being able to mitigate the randomness seems farfetched.

Another solid game by Space Cowboys: medium weight gamer's game, but easy enough to be enjoyed by families with some gaming experience.

It is essentially a set collecting game: in five turns you draft cards (with values 1, 2 or 3) from a central offering, trying to form sets of the same value but different colors, or of the same color but different value.
The interesting part comes from card effects and combos, and from a variable set up (somewhat similar to Dominion): in each game only 5 of the 8 decks are used, and each deck has 21 different cards with a peculiar "flavor".

Definitely an interesting game, maybe a little probe to analysis paralysis.

A very intriguing game with excellent artwork.  I love the balancing of taking cards for their powers vs. just to place them in your "legends" to score bonus points at the end of the game.  Plus, having all of the cards face up on the table to see what's available makes it a great tug-of-war with just the right amount of luck!

However, this is *not* a game for everyone; I've found you need to be patient with new players, as they will read over every single card in play, and there are so many things to keep track of (legends, powers that are available, what other players are going for, quest tiles, money and points) that some players may become overwhelmed with the complexity.  That said, having the included guide that explains the intricacies of every single card in the game, along with reference cards for scoring and commonly-used symbols, is *awesome* and means you'll never have arguments over what a card means or does!

The balancing of using card powers vs when to put them below to score them is fun. Having multiple card decks in the box means there lots of replayability too. The game feels like it ends a round early as you only collect 15 cards the entire game. I suppose being a little short is better than being a little long though.

I have played this tableau building game. It is a fun activity, but I feel after 5 plays in I am done. Blue peg, pink peg brought this up. I didn't believe them after 3 plays, but after 5 plays I am just not as interested in playing it again. A solid expansion that introduces either new gods or new actions for the current gods would have increased the replayability. It is a great game and you should play a copy if you have the opportunity.

Picked this up at Gen Con 2015 and like to play this whenever I can. Can easily add an expansion or two. Good but not great replay-ability as your strategy remains the same out of a few possibilities, hence adding expansion would add more appeal.

A fast playing light midweight Euro with relatively simple rules with the complexity coming from learning what the cards do. Once that hurdle is crossed it flies quickly. There is a little bit of take that with specific decks of the cards, but nothing too drastic to find unappealing to a hard core Euro gamer.

You are set collecting and pulling off card powers in the attempt to run your engine faster or slow down your opponents while trying to achieve your sets. Replayability is suspect for me, but I had a fun time while playing it. A little longer playtime and it would have overstayed it's welcome.

Good looking components/art and an insert that seems to work for a change.

Decent concept, Gameplay is straight forward. There are a bunch of cards that you can buy with a standardized amount of money that you have every turn. These cards are used to make sets and grant certain powers or victory points. Then, after 5 rounds, these sets are worth victory points. Whoever has the most, wins.

Initial Impression:
---------------------
It's tough to say I was disappointed with a "7" rated game, but with all the hype, I was actually expecting a bit more.  The replayability is pretty awesome with this one, but at least with my first play, it wasn't as interested as I had hoped.  I am kind of surprised the game is listed currently at best with 4, as I feel like 3 players (or maybe 2) is probably its sweet spot.  The decisions on what column to discard, and what card to take can be a bit AP inducing, and really caused our first game to slow down a bit too much, but I expect that would improve as people are more familiar with the cards.  I do plan to explore this one further, but this is actually me least favorite game of the KdJ nominees for 2015.

RATING: 7.5
Great game!

Easy to explain and understand, but hard to master. The variety of cards in each deck makes it a very deep and strategic game. 

Each deck has its own flavour, so it takes times to get used to them and play properly. Exploiting the cards' powers is very important and it seems that you will be more confortable with your decisions, once you get to know the "uniqueness" of each deck.

It surprised by the amount of interactivity that the game provides. It's not a "take that" interactivy (sometime it is). It's subtle. The way you maneuvre your pillars will impact other player's decisions, so it can be very tricky and tactical at times. 

The art is superb. The way it was designed it leaves an open window for expansions, so be prepare for much more.

I'd love to say that the theme is on. It isn't! You never feel that you're in Ancient Greece, writing a legend, etc... but that's ok! The game is entertaining and once you pass the initial AP proeness (reading all the cards in the AGORA), it really has a nice flow!

I like it!

Take a bit of Splendor, mix it with a bit of Abyss, a bit of Smash Up  (Have 8 Factions which you use 5) (Never the same game), Set collection ala Splendor/Ticket to Ride. If I didn't know ant better I would think Friedman Friese made a new version of CopyCat (melding a bunch of successful games together)
It's good jury is still out. Will it win the Spiel. This game would be harder to get into than say Machi Koro or The Game. 

I hated Machi Koro so I going to pick Machi Koro to win, I would Id be happy to see this win since you have to make tough choices whereas Koro leaves you no decsions.

Clever spin on set collection by changing up the way cards are made available to the player.  Ultimately it is just another a pick a card, try to find the other cards that create combo effects, generate some income to spend so you can place your cards into the scoring area, hope the card you need comes up in the card offer and time your move to the player order board so you don't get left without a good move.  Not the kind of game that I typically enjoy but I didn't dislike Elysium.  It didn't convert me either.  Nice components, artwork looks great so the production boosts the rating up.  One issue with the cards is that the writing on the card explaining the iconography is very small.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Provisional rating, need to play it more (and 2 player).

Euro set collecting game - there is a theme and the mechanics are well matched, but you won't have a strong narrative playing this game. Definitely tactical - you can't guarantee which cards will appear nor when, so it's about taking the best 4 options each turn.

This could induce AP in some - avoid playing with 4 if some are AP prone as the number of options increases significantly.

Overall, like it a lot, but Neptune can be nasty, and it's recommended his deck is used in your first game. I can see why, mechanics wise it's simple, but it does introduce a bit of 'take that' to the game that some will dislike.

Drafting, set collection, nothing very special there. However, I loved the little mechanism of the four coloured pions, that serve as currency. To buy a card of a specific colour, you need the corresponding pion (not yet used that round), but you can then pay with a pion of another colour.

Es un juego de cartas, en el que cada jugador dispone de un tablero (que es solo una franja de carton). Las cartas sobre la franja son el dominio y bajo la franja son la leyenda. El juego consiste en cinco rondas. En cada ronda, el jugador escoge una de las cartas ofrecidas (Se ofrecen 3 por jugador +1) o una de las cartas que altera el orden del turno. Para poder coger una carta debes disponer de un token del color adecuado, según los símbolos que aparezcan en dicha carta. Es decir, en cada turno, el jugador va a escoger siempre tres cartas y una de turno. La gracia está en las restricciones a la hora de coger carta.  Si llega un momento en que no puedes coger, tienes que coger un ciudadano, que es un comodín que penaliza al final de la partida.
Cuando todos han gastado sus token, los jugadores pueden ganar dinero y puntos de partida, según la carta de turno y además, pueden trasnferir cartas del dominio a la leyenda, para confeccionar lotes que puntúan al final de la partida. 
Por último, cada carta tiene unos efectos que se pueden aplicar meintras la carta esté en el dominio. Algunos permanentes,otros de un solo uso, otros inmediatos.
Dificultad moderada. Rapido de jugar si conoces las cartas. Mecánica elegante. Me gustó mucho cuando lo probé.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ Great, medium weight tableau-building, card drafting and set collection game with a really smooth gameplay.
++ I love the twist on card drafting where you must have the required columns to draft a certain card and spend any one of your column afterward. This add a lot of tension between players that must carefully watch their opponents and they must time every moves.
++ I love the fact that you need to transfer your cards from you tableau (thus losing some abilities) to your Elysium to be able to score them in a clever set-collection way where you must decide, as you go, how to combine your cards (how you want to "write your Legends" as family sets or level sets).
++ I really like that a lot of the decisions are hard to made, balancing the abilities of the cards right now and their potential to score big afterward, while also considering the timing to get all what you want (as timing is a major part of the game).
++ I really like that the cards abilities are both written with text and iconography. The text helps for the first few games, and when we are familiar with the cards, just a quick glance at the icons and we know what the cards are doing. Also, the iconography is really good and easy to understand.
++ Great replayability coming from the fact that only 5 out of the 8 gods families are used in any game (56 totally different combinaisons possible!), and that each of these families, though sharing some common mechanisms, have a different feel and strategy to it. 
++ Good components: The card are of good quality and have good art on them, and the tokens are fine. The columns are really great and give a nice tactile feel to this card-base game.
++ Great game insert which hold everything in an orderly fashion, and in a beautiful way (giving a look of a temple even when the game is in the box).
++ Fun, relatively easy to teach, relatively fast to set-up and really fast to play game.


:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- It's a tiny bit more luck-driven than I love, as sometime some cards color or level never show up in a 2-player game (as we only see 35 out of the 105 cards in any game).
-- This game takes a lot of table space because each player build their own tableau (Domain and Elysium)  but you also need place for the Agora where you draft and the Temple that hold the quest (and potentially the Oracle). Beyond 3 player, a normal kitchen table may be not enough!
-- Although I really like Greek mythology theme, I agree with some critics that the theme is "pasted on" but not that "thin" (as some says). I could easily see a Game of Throne version of Elysium using the Lannister, the Targaryen, the Stark, the Greyjoy and the Tyrell, instead of Hephaestus, Ares, Athena, Hades and Zeus for exemple. In fact it would be great IMO.
-- According to the latest news, even thought a full standalone expansion game has been fully designed, it will not be published by Space Cowboy. So for now, there is no expansion available to refresh the game when we will have overplayed it.

After two plays, I'd definitely suggest sticking to 3p. This really is an interesting set of ideas, but I think it's just too overwrought. It wouldn't take that much simplification to make it much more accessible: remove the pillar mechanic, use a smaller variety of simpler special powers, something along those lines. But at the level of complexity it's at, combined with a high level of chaos and the ease of making really punishing small mistakes, it's a hard game to recommend, even though it does have a bunch of cool stuff going on.
---
I had been avoiding this just because of the obvious massive AP potential, given the grousps I play with tend to have some susceptibility to that particular problem. But I enjoyed it when I got the chance to play it - the AP, while a thing, was actually nowhere near as bad as I feared. It's actually a fairly clever blending of drafting, tableau building, and melding, where you have to get all your cards into your underworld in order for them to score, and that pipe is limited, but stuff has good powers which you'd like to hang on to.

Having said this, the drafting mechanic is in fact complicated and totally abstract, so the tolerance of the other players is the only limit you're up against on how much time you can spend here. It's not great. I feel like you could play this game completely without the pillar mechanic - just grab the card or turn order you want on your turn and be done with it - and it might work just as well, or better, and play faster. Not sure. The pillars serve to prune the search space later in the round, but earlier in the round it costs a fair amount of time as people have to figure out what to dump. The round is going to get easier as time goes on just due to limited choices anyway.

Regardless, the 60m time estimate on the box is totally delusional. Figure 2h for 4 players, and it could easily go significantly longer if your metagame/social contract tolerates it.

Anyway, I enjoyed it, but the playing time is an obstacle. You need a group that can finish in a rational amount of time (60-90m). This may be fairly hard to do. It's a fixed fun game - maybe even a less-than-fixed-fun game - so 3p maybe best.

People have complained about the theming, but I'm not sure they know what that word means. It certainly lacks any narrative sense. But the god families have powers that cohere thematically and do give nods to their Olympian counterparts. It's not a lot, but it's there, as much as it is any any decent mechanics-first hobbyist game. It's no worse than, say, 7 Wonders.

I really like the choices and interaction generated by the card selection system via the columns. The simplicity of the rules, game duration, and lifespan make this game addictive.
Some cards you get can be useless depending on the cards that come out on the next turns, which can be very frustrating, and the combo part is interesting but a bit too solitaire for me.
Neat 3rd game from the Cowboys !

Really good card drafting/engine building game with a lot of good card interactions.

The drafting mechanism is pretty unique and interesting, and really makes you look at what cards other players might potentially draft, allowing to play a game of chicken, deciding on a level of risk on what you need now vs. what might still be hanging around later.

Also great replayability with 8 possible gods to use, and only 5 used per game!

I assume this one will be very popular, as it scratches all the right itches.  The rules are simple, the game plays fairly quickly, and the game has good depth given the first two points.  Good stuff!

Relatively easy to teach the game. It may seem that at first glance your options are limited by the colums you have to remove with every card/quest you take, but it suprised me how much you're able to steer it in a favorable direction during a round. Because everything is open information, it has a potential for "analysis paralysis" (beware), but in my experience you shouldnt think too long what you take each turn, makes it much more enjoyable.

I love card drafting and greek mythology so I knew this would be right up my alley! Players must take cards into their domain gaining special abilities and retiring them into their Elysium to score points at the end of the game. After each move, players must remove one of their 4 colored columns from play, but your remaining columns dictate what cards you are able to draft. It's a very cool mechanism that definitely rewards strategic planning. I love the fact that each of 8 decks have something different to offer and since you only mix in 5 of the 8 each game, there is a lot of replayability. There is a lot of iconography to learn at first so it might be a bit overwhelming for certain players and it will take a few games to learn the different decks and be able to formulate a strategy from the start of the game. Otherwise, it's a very good game and lovely one to look at.

RATING: 7.5
Not too shabby a game.  Enough going on to be interesting and a little bit of screwage to add enough fun.  There are enough set up options to keep it from going stale too soon.  I don't know if I feel like it has a certain Splendor feel to it because it is Space Cowboys or because it really has a little soupcon of Splendor in there.  Without knowing all the possible combinations that could have came out, I think it is simple enough to just jump in to a game and give it a run fo ryour money.  I do think the more you play the more you will beat everyone else, so it is a game that you want to have others play repeatedly to get the "learning enough of the card powers" to make them competitive, out of the way.  Good game, definitely on my wishlist.

Interesting set collection game with cards. It has a slight abstract feel with obtaining cards and choosing which color to give up. The game has potential to move up in rating but I feel it needs repetitive play to feel out the variety of cards, some card combinations seem highly powerful. There's nice art and the game box stores everything perfectly. I see this playing well with all player counts and in a good timely manner.

My first play was very enjoyable although I think for me the fewer players the better. With 4 the decision space is just too big to start each round with 13 cards really brought out the AP in our group about what to pick during the early part of each round. While I know fewer players has fewer cards which can hurt strategy I'm not yet convinced that the extended playing time with 4 is worth it as the game did outstay it's welcome by a little bit. We also played with the recommended starter set of cards so it was not as combo heavy as I was looking forward to and I've heard some of the other decks do help with that aspect of the game more. I'll definitely play this again and look forward to trying some different combinations.

Pretty darn good and a lot of neat things going on here. I love the variety in choosing which decks you want to play and how much that can change things. The column mechanism is a little AP-inducing but very cool. Keeps you watching and invested in what other players are doing, which can be hard to do in a game like this. It's very solid (also, probably the best-conceived insert I've ever come across).

I think this has the most beautiful card art of any game I have ever played. I would say the card art is probably better than the game itself. However, I don't mean that too disparagingly as the game (a nice mix of drafting, set collection, and cards with powers) is still quite fun and the artwork really is that amazing.

Engine building game through card drafting. The clever bit is that any time you take a card, you limit your future options. Mostly tactical, due to the card draw and other player actions. This is not a family game, it requires keeping an eye on all your opponents and thwarting their plans as you go, especially since some cards specifically attack other players. Of course you can play in a more light hearted way, but that's selling the game short. Also, "myths" are rummy melds? Really?

I found the combos less than thrilling, and the meanness of the whole thing non-entertaining. I love Age of Steam, being mean at that game does not bother me to the least, because the gameplay is engaging and thematic and being tough on your opponents is necessitated by spatial limitations. Here, it was an induced design decision, that also feels anti-thematic to me.

There is an average game hidden under this offensive posture, it is just not for me.

Elysium is an interesting mix of tableau building and set collection via a drafting mechanic. All of these mechanisms work for me. You'll certainly be rewarded by multiple plays allowing you to get to know the cards better and draw out more strategy from the game. It has perhaps the greatest box insert ever created (although it'll be useless if an expansion comes out). I expect to play this one a bit.

I should have known better. I just find myself getting tired of games with zillions of cards that do zillions of things. I don't so mind the games like Marco Polo (the new one) where there are zillions of cards, but you see all you're ever going to see during setup for a given game. But with Elysium you're seeing all new cards every round. And looking at those cards and figuring out which to get and how to make the best use of them is the whole game. There's no shared board with shared player state. Most player interaction is either accidental or spiteful.

Mythology-themed games always interest me, so I was really hoping this was going to be a good one. The art was stunning, and I'd heard good things. I was not disappointed.

Each round players are claiming 3 cards and 1 "quest tile" with the goal of finding clever ways to get gold, score points, and eventually move cards into sets in your Elysium. But the catch is that once a card moves into the latter, you no longer get to use its ability. There is also a very clever mechanism for selecting cards - the "cost" is one or two columns in four colors. After taking a card, you must set aside a column, so your choices are reduced.

While it's a bit of a challenge to play with the AP-prone, this is vying for my best new-to-me game in 2015. There are many strategies you can employ to snatch a win, and it's just a little bit nasty in terms of player interaction. As I mentioned, the components are beautiful, and even the box insert is well-designed. You can also clearly see the potential for expansions here simply by adding another god(ess) to the mix. Highest recommendation!

A good to very good game, I had hoped this would win the Kennerspiel des Jahres award it was nominated for! It would have deserved it and I want expansions for it! :) I particularly like it *much* better than the other two nominees.

The game is more tactical than strategical, but has strategic elements as well. While I probably generally prefer more strategic games, more tactical games certainly have their place as well and can be very nice for a change. And Elysium is! :)
The game offers really high versatility and thus replay appeal with the different god families and also with different player numbers. (The main reason it plays considerably different with 4 players than with 3 is how much harder it is with 4 players to avoid having to take an Incomplete Quest.) I had already guessed so before the first game right after reading the rules, but I was even pleasantly surprised after the first few games how very different it actually plays.
The pretty artwork (nice to have the different god families illustrated by different artists) and the great looking and practical insert are very nice bonuses - particularly given how sloppy and impractical inserts of many other games are.
Also very good that the designers are active and readily answer questions on these forums! :)

I quite enjoyed this, despite it being more tactical than I tend to prefer; making long-term plans is hard when you don't know what's coming up. (Playing with Apollo/the Oracle would presumably mitigate this.) It's not all tactics, though: you know what's in your Domain, and can make plans for ordering-of-transfer to Elysium (and Legends therein), which in turn inform your drafts.

Game length / analysis time was totally fine with 2p, but it seems like 4p could well become a massive AP-fest. 3p might remain good?

There are many interesting constraints and dilemmas here: drafting limitations based on pillar color; drafting desires based on powers, color, and number; score-or-keep (and when); and how to arrange your cards for best effect as you score them. It's kind of puzzle-y along multiple axes simultaneously. I liked it, and see why it's been so popular.

My first two plays had mixed results.  I enjoyed the first game, but the second game had a new player who took unbearably long on his turn, repeatedly reading the cards.  Sometimes he took 5 minutes to decide.  If players are quick, then I think the game is very enjoyable.  I do wish the font on the cards was bigger.  It is hard to read and almost impossible to set up the game such that all 4 players can read the cards without having to pick them up.  Once the icons are understood, reading of the text will be unnecessary.  But it certainly does hinder teaching the game to new players.
I could see this game growing on me once I understood how the card powers can be best utilized.

This is a fun card game. It took us a little bit to get used to just how quickly you need to transfer cards to your Elysium.

The action selection mechanism of this game is neat where you select cards based on the coloured pillars you have left. However, it feels as though their isn't a lot of strategic depth and often you're left picking cards that you can just take. Also, you're not going through the whole deck of cards which you've made which means set collection is a little dependent on what cards actually come out. Good game but nothing that keeps me coming back.

RATING: 6
A clever and solid design - card-drafting, for engine-building and set collection - with VP's coming from the engine and the sets.

The drafting mechanic with the pillars is very well done and the transfer/promotion from engine to sets is interesting. The theme is however only present in the game's artwork, although the latter is first rate.

Increasingly this is just not my type of game - however, if it's the kind of game you like, then this is a good one of it's type, although it's not without some flaws even judged on what it is trying to be.

- There is quite a bit of luck in terms of the cards available - if the values/types you need for your sets are not available, then you are not going to score well, and the mechanic of cards as wildcard citizens does not quite mitigate this enough. Each game will see only part of the deck used so being screwed on card availability will happen.

- Turn order is also important but half the info you need to determine how important isn't available until the cards are turned by which time you have made your decision.

- There is a lot of info on cards and to play well you need to look at what opponents are doing and are capable of - with ten available cards to draft from and several cards in opponents tableau's and scoring area, this gives huge scope for the AP prone.

- Clarifying text on the cards is ridiculously small - designers/artists, please, just because it's readable on a bright computer screen at 400% resolution doesn't mean it's easy to read when actually in print on a card across the table.

Add at least 1.5 to my rating if you are a set collecting, theme averse, Euro head.

Pretty good game, but the 60 minutes per game is a joke for initial game.  There are so many cards to review before each round...13 I think for a 4er game.  There are combo's galore in the game which may not be the thing for some people.  And unless we played a rule wrong, the Hades card that allows you to drop a ton down into Elysium on the final turn seems broken.  It allows you to keep your combo's going much longer than normal.  Still, I generally like this kind of game so I don't think the game will drop below 6 and could potentially rise.

Really just not fun. A ton of the cards feel the exact same and there are very few opportunities for real satisfying synergy, although maybe that's not the case with 3 or 4 players. You can pick up 3 cards for the same god in the first epoch and then never see another good card for that god all game, so the game can essentially punish you for making the right decision. Maybe it's different with Apollo/Hermes/Ares, but given the design of the rest of the game it's doubtful. Rated below even mediocre social games since it doesn't have the fun group aspect or silly shenanigans that those games produce.

I think this game is very clever and nicely produced.  However, I also find it rather straightforward and unexciting.  I get that it is purposely and necessarily tight, but I don't particularly enjoy the restrictive nature of the design.  I feel like it needs some kind of additional spark.  Elysium reminds me of Splendor for some reason, although I like Elysium more.

Maybe it's the theme or artwork (which I am fine with but maybe just not exciting enough)?

RATING: 7
(Tentative rating after one play, but I might be leaning towards an 8).   Drafting and set collection, done in an interesting mechanical fashion.   There's almost no theme at all, but the mechanics here are enough to carry it.   I liked the decision about when to move your cards down and give up their special powers.   That's key to the game.   In a way, it reminded me of Seasons (the card abilities, mainly).  It would be nice to know how many of a certain number/suit are in the deck, but because they aren't all the same, this information has to be looked up in a manual that details each card.  A little unfortunate.   I guess the Oracle gives some look-ahead but I'm not sure the game needs the extra AP that would result.   Happy to play, and may well add this one to the collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I really want to explore this game more. I love the idea of mixing together a subset of smaller focused decks to produce a complex, but unique, game deck. Interactions tend to be fairly interesting and the concept of moving cards into scoring but out of usability is always powerful - further emphasized by the limited means by which you can make the movement.

Our games tend to be pretty tight - although close scores are most often separated the degree of Civilian-use (i.e. winner is, invariably, someone who managed to not use any Civilians.)

Excellent card game with a nice public drafting mechanic. It is a trick taking, tableau building, card drafting game which works only in 4 players.

Still a very fine game with a lot of possibilities.

Elysium is a card game of Greek gods and set collection. The two main resources of the game are pillars and money. At the beginning of each round, each player has a set of four pillars in four different colours (blue, red, yellow, and green). With these pillars, players draft cards from a pool of cards (similar to Core Worlds) or quest tiles (these provide turn order, money, transfer capabilities, and sometimes VP's). You must balance what you want/need with the chance of having the wrong pillar colours left at the end of the round which forces you to take a 'broken quest' (gimpy version of a normal quest), or a wild card (which has no special abilities, provides negative VP at the end of game, but does have the benefit of being useful for creating sets).

Cards drafted have various abilities and a level. They aren't the most exciting based on what I've seen thus far. Throughout the game you will have the opportunity transfer cards. When transferring cards, you are trying to create sets of the same level from each of the five gods or a card of each of the three levels from the same god. Sets provide end of game VP and also allow players to compete for public goals. Sadly, when you transfer cards to sets, they lose their abilities (unless it's end of game VP bonuses). I find myself not enjoying games that ask me to dismantle my engine or what I've built very much.

The appeal of this game is that each game you use 5 of the 8 sets of cards belonging to various Greek gods. The set of cards for each god are very different. So, depending on the mix of God cards, the play experience will change. I'm sure there will eventually be expansions with new God cards sets. I enjoyed this game and it's pretty easy to teach. It's a well put-together game and has some interesting decisions. That said, it doesn't excite me as much as some of my favorite card games.

2-Player variants:

The game has problems with 2 players. Namely, with such a large deck and less cards available for draft, there is more luck involved with collecting sets and getting snake symbols. Either: 

1) Remove 2 duplicate cards per each level per family. For the level 2's (there are 3 unique cards with duplicate), discard a non-snake duplicate for each unique card. 

OR

2) Leave the decks as normal but setup for a 4-player game and do an alternating draft-draft-remove from game-remove from game method to simulate the 4-player game.

Pre-Play Comments:  I am going to post this game to the list of the best inserts.  Whomever designed it did a great job for various reasons, including:  1/ The sheets to be punched were added on top of the insert, so the game box doesn't close properly until they are punched and discarded;  2/The cards fit perfectly into the slots (even if, 3/, they are sleeved) and do not fall out regardless of the orientation of the box during storage. 4/ Will add just that it's a standard sized box which, owing to the increasing number that are not, is appreciated. [Sleeves not needed, but Mayday 63.5x88 125% work.]

I think what I really love about this game is that it's essentially a classic set collection card game, but has some really interesting variation when you bring in the card powers.  I also love the purchasing mechanic with the columns.  

Yes, the theme is a little weak, but entirely forgivable.

Much better the second time I played. You need to twist your head around a little, since you are not discarding the column you pay with, but you get used to it. A lot of good interaction and quite simple and nice dilemmas. Want to get it to the table more often after this.

The different colored columns are an excellent mechanic that adds more strategy to the card-drafting portion of the game. I love how much the game will change depending on which set of five decks are used. Some of the abilities are similar across all of the decks, but they each also have a unique focus.

Some cards are a must and insta pick. Some other are situational. Those situational ones decide whether you win or lose.

RATING: 9
Excellent drafting game. Knowing which pillars to give up, which abilities to draw upon or what cards to take for your sets as well as what cards prevent opponents from completing their sets make for a great amount of tension without too much complexity. Coupled with the amount of replayability with the decks in the box, Elysium may not be a favourite with most other people I know but it's a game I love and continue to thoroughly enjoy each time it gets to the table.

RATING: N/A
While this seems like a pretty lightweight and simple game, I really enjoyed the one time I played it, with multiple paths to victory seeming viable.  A simple set collection mechanism coupled with special powers and the need to decide at what point you should sacrifice those special powers to gain points made for an intriguing game.  I'd definitely be game to try this one again, although I'm not rushing to add it to the collection.

RATING: 6
One 2-player game.
Can't say it grabbed me. Can't say it repulsed me. Feels rather patchwork-y to me and the column card-choosing mechanic feels weird (or maybe it's great). Feels like maybe someone wanted to mash together Splendor and 7 Wonders? In that case I'll choose 7 Wonders which seems more straightforward and likely plays a lot faster than this will with more players.

I could be entirely full of shit here.

[Update]
Another 2p game with different cards. My friend really enjoyed collecting a bunch of cards to create synergies and I blithely thought he'd never be able to transfer for scoring. Wrong. Lots of cards in one deck allow transfers outside of the normal mechanism. Anyway, it highlights one feature I don't like about certain games like this: figuring out ways to get a bunch of different cards to work together. I'm impatient and get no joy from this type of thing. Maybe if I play more and get more accustomed to the cards I'll get ok with it.

[Update]
Another 2p. Upgraded rating to 6. It's a decent game but poring over card text and parsing out card interactions is still not something I'm into very much. I can see this game dragging on with more players.

I really enjoyed this card driven set collection game with a mythological theme.

There are 8 gods (decks) included in the box and only 5 are used in a game, each of the god decks are shuffled together and you do not see the whole deck in a playthrough this means there is going to be a lot of replayability here.

Each of the god decks has its own unique flavour as well Ares earning a player prestige points which can be converted to victory points, Poseidon hindering your opponents, Apollo involving the oracle so you know some of the card that will turn up the following epoch (turn). There are also suggestions in the rules booklet regarding specific set ups for different styles of games based upon which gods are selected.

The columns mechanic is very novel and actually offers quite a bit of player interaction as you need to keep an eye on what your opponents still have left so you can ensure you do not get caught out with columns left and nothing you can 'spend' them on.

I like that the card effects only occur when the card is in your domain but will only score if it is in your elysium, this adds another level to the card choices.

Tablóépítős kártyajáték fannak tartom magamat, így régóta szemezgetek a játékkal. Pláne, hogy KSDJ jelölt is volt, így már kötelező volt a próba.
A központi mechanizmus, hogy lapot viszünk, és kiteszünk egy tetszőleges színű oszlopot. Persze csak olyan lapot vihetünk, amilyen színű oszlopunk még van. Ez sokkal jobban hangzik leírva, mint amennyire tetszett. Főleg, hogy a kipasszoláshoz nagyon fontos, sőt muszáj egy egyedi oszlopuknak maradnia. Így viszont iszonyat függünk a többiektől, és nem egy kiszámolható függés ez, hanem inkább random.
Ugyanez igaz a kártyák elvitelére is. Ha belegebedsz se fogod tudni kitalálni, hogy a többiek mire hajtanak. Így mindig viszed, ami maradt. Persze ebből lehet kombókat kitenni, de túl hosszú távra nem tudsz tervezni. 
Megtalálni a neked legjobb lapot, az aktuális páston nem annyira kreatív gondolkodás, mint inkább szöszölés, rejtvényfejtés. 
Összességében némi csalódás volt, ami annak is köszönhető, hogy nagyon sokat vártam tőle. Nem egy rossz játék, de nagyon fárasztó, és nem a jófajta kreatív energiákat szívja, hanem inkább az agyam borsóválogató részeit. Erre jön még rá egy akkora adag interakció, amit én már inkább káoszként értelmezek. Ráadásul az utolsó pillanatig képtelenség megmondani, hogy ki hogy áll, így ezzel az interakcióval még csak egyensúlyozni se lehet.

Nagy pozítivum ugyanakkor, hogy a dinamukisan összerakott pakli miatt, végtelen az újrajátszhatósága. Gondolom hamarosan lesz kieg hozzá, na akkor már kontinum. (persze ide is egy hátrány: emiatt viszont a setup eléggé fájdalmas)

Splendor on steroids

- the game is entirely driven by set collection. First and foremost I'm scanning the cards looking for the numbers I need, powers and combo building are secondary and in most cases purely incidental
- the column mechanic felt gimmicky. Remove it from the game and you lose nothing
- game was way too long, with too much downtime

Colour me unimpressed.

RATING: 5
"I use these cards to activate this card to use that card to score a point." This, in essence, is Elysium. Of course, there also is a little drafting mini game in there and, possibly the most interesting aspect of the game, having to decide between end game scoring opportunities and being able to use the card effects repeatedly. All in all, it is a fairly simple combo building and set collection game that hides its simplicity behind a facade of cards with lots of different icons and tiny text all of which adds a lot of complexity for little gain in depth. I'm always wary of games whose supposed draw is "endless replayability through combinatorial explosion" and this shows why: First and foremost, Elysium presents a parsing problem for the players to solve which I simply don't find all that interesting.

Betrachtet man das Wort Elysium als Versprechen eines Ortes, an dem die Seele glücklich ist, so wird man im Spiel ELYSIUM enttäuscht: man landet in den Hirnwindungen eines Kopfes. ELYSIUM ist eine komplexe, konstruierte, themenloses Kartensammelei für Hirnis. ELYSIUM wird seine Denker und Grübler finden, aber für Kinder wie mich mit Liebe zu Abenteuerspielplatz und Räuber-und-Gendarm im Wald mit Tannennadelduft und geheimnisvollem Knacken im Unterholz, wandern die abgetrennten Köpfe von antiken Göttern aus dem Olymp vorbei. Der Übergang aus der irdischen Welt in das Elysium ist hier nur eine mathematische Trennlinie aus dem Taschenrechner. Ein Brettspiel, das zu mir will, darf mehr als sein als eine Berechnung am Reißbrett, das gut funktioniert. Die Zeitlupe beweist: Die Nominierung zum Kennerspiel des Jahres 2015 ist eine klassische Schiedsrichterfehlentscheidung. By the way: Manuel Gräfe hat sich die Hamburger Raute auf den Penis tätowieren lassen.

After 1st play - a bit disappointed. Why? 
There's a LOT going on - too much (at least for my first play). It's really a bit fiddly to set up, tear down, and even to play. But the "play fiddling" is due to the many, many things you have to think of when playing. You're thinking of a) what the diff cards can do; b) the Family a card belongs to; c) the level of the card; d) the synergy of the cards; e) which column to dismiss, etc., etc. First play I was in a fog. Perhaps it will be easier once I've gotten familiar with it.

Elysium reminded me a lot of Valley of the Kings when I first played, mainly the part where you have actions available to you through cards that you have played, but you must choose the right time to "bank" them in order to score for them at the end of the game. Otherwise, Elysium feels like its own game, with your usual card drafting for effects but also some rummy melding for victory points by the end of the game.  The introductory deck feels a little straightforward and there weren't that too many "interesting" cards, but I think some of the other decks would definitely add to the experience.  I can see how it got drowned out relatively quickly, which is unfortunate. There are enough tough decisions in this game to make it perfectly pleasant as one of several games to play in a evening of gaming. But it's a tough market out there to get a "card drafting for effects" game wildly popular. First time ever I played was with 2 players and while Elysium had a nice feel, it certainly suffered from a small card pool. Cards drive the game so 2-player doesn't really do it justice. With 4 players, I was able to experience the game the way it was meant to be played... and yet I think I liked it less.  There are some neat ideas in the game. I love the idea of different "families" being used each session to give the game variety.  Pretty solid production values.  And on spec alone, the system where available cards are restricted through playing your "columns" is a neat concept. But I found by the end that the restrictions felt largely artificial, heavy mechanic-wise and the amount of mental gymnastics needed to make the best moves wasn't really worth the pay-off, given this game should have been a little more straightforward in the drafting department.  I felt like I wanted to consider cool card combinations, but the system of restriction kept getting in the way and isn't nearly interesting enough to make me feel like it was a "fun" part of the experience.  Overall, Elysium is a good game, but didn't really fit my style in some of the places it needed to. Too bad. I really wanted to like this one more than I did!

After a bad 4p first game where we got some rules wrong, I finally got another game of this in at 3p.

It's a fantastic tablo building game with lots of decisions on what cards to go for, when to transfer cards and to make sure to score lots of VP before the end because there re only 5 rounds in the game. Played very fast at 3p, even with 1 new.

We played Elysium, this time with the full complement of 4 players, I think I liked it better 2 players. There are just too many cards to consider and because there were so many people taking turns, when it comes back to your turn, things have changed too much. Also it is very hard to keep track of what the other player's tableau is doing, as knowing what others are doing is important in this game. The graphics/symbols in the game are too varied and complex to just know what is happening across the table at a glance, making it very slow going if you plan a lot. I found myself just "doing whatever" to keep the game going at a brisk pace. On the other hand and contrary to the general consensus, the 2 player experience I had was excellent. I can see why this was runner up to Broom Service in this year's Kenner Spiel de Jahres.

This game packs a ridiculous number of interesting choices in a short playtime. It's pretty simple to teach, every turn you pick 3 cards and a turn order tile, then you move cards to your elysium - repeat 5 times and it's done. However the way you pick cards and choosing which column to give up is such a fascinating decision, I'm surprised it's not talked about more because the column system is sheer brilliance! The elysium system is not as innovative, but it still provides agonising decisions every turn whether to score a great card or keep it for its abilities. It's a bit AP-prone and can be exhausting if you're competitive, but it's great fun!

Elysium features drafting, tableau building, card combos, and combos-vs-points mechanic. Like Hansa Teutonica, this is a good example of a game that pushes you to develop a certain strategy and pursue it while also offering lots of player interaction. Of course, Elysium doesn't have as much take-that as HT but it can be present in taking turn-order cards and in sniping someone's scoring marker for Legends that comprise one number. Grudge drafting offers another aspect of player interaction. 

Elysium is a highly enjoyable game that lasts just the right amount of turns and doesn't make for too much downtime.

Elysium is not an elegant game. The "kicked out" mechanism in The Gallerist is inelegant, yet it is one of my favorite games. Being inelegant is not a fatal flaw. But when you combine inelegance with complexity and short play time, that's a triple whammy for me. The game has lots of iconography, tough to understand end game scoring, unique set collection and a fussy domain/Elysium mechanic. The reason why the short play time matters is that by the time you grasp what is going on, you are four rounds into a game that only lasts five rounds. By that time it is too late. And chances are, you won't play it again until much time has passed, which means you need to re-learn it all over again. I think upon repeated plays, this one might shine, but it's still not my kind of experience. I'll probably avoid this one in the future.

I really like this game.  It has a similar feel as Deus (setting up combos in an antiquity theme) even though the mechanics are different.  The art is great and all god decks have a very different theme (ranging from the nice Athena that helps everybody to the nasty Poseidon that hinders the other players).  Very strategic and with a lot of player interaction (can be even a little cutthroat at times)

Too heavy for how deep it is, thanks to a drafting mechanic that rewards you for not only planning out your whole round in advance, but also for building a mental tree of what you'll do if an opponent does X, Y or Z.

On the other hand, in a game where pacing is key, it allows multiple strategies to run at different speeds, especially if Hades or Apollo is in play. I like a lot of what it does, I just wish it did it a little differently. And while individual cards have theme, the game has no coherent feel to its story. It's just "You're a demigod, and demigods love victory points." Obviously.

This is a step up from your run of the mill set building/card drafting games.  It has card interaction similar to 7 Wonders and player interaction/action management of Splendor.

Elysium is a part engine builder, part drafting game with unique twists to both. When drafting, players get four "resources" to pay for cards. After every time a card is chosen, the player must still have that color "resource," then must discard one of the resources. The makes for engaging short term decisions and clever planning the next two or three cards. When building the engine, players get abilities from cards, but the only way to score, is to destroy the engine and turn the cards into a collection of sets. With lots of smaller and rapid decisions, Elysium is an engine builder that doesn't get bogged down by sequential chain of actions that combo and trigger. It does still have situations where opponents will be using abilities and actions that other players don't care for or are aware of at all. Often compared to Deus and Imperial Settlers, Elysium is the smoothest and most pleasant to play of the card-based engine builder trio.

RATING: 6
If I wanted to play Race for the Galaxy, I would.
I tend to prefer my card engine games more manageable, in the likes of San Juan, 51 State or Imperial Settlers.
Elysium has way too much going for it to be enjoyable to the ocasional player. I'm certain that thanks to the variety in the box, 5 of 8 decks bein played to a total of 56 combinations, it can be really enjoyed by more dedicated groups, but to the "power player" that seeks actual variety of games (or simply someone who plays with different groups most times) it simply is not worth it.
If you must, play it with 3-4 players. 2 probably works, but as with most games of this type, makes it a different game altogether.

Excellent set collection game. The card powers are not strong enough to change this fundamental mechanism, but they add some important considerations to your drafting. This is the simple fact that those who dislike the game are missing - they are looking for ultra powerful card combos which just aren't there. Elysium is the game of the gods!

Fantastic art!

Really, it ALL fits together so well. Though different, there are enough similarities in my simple mind for me to say that Elysium is my 7 Wonders.

Finally, the box insert is worth mentioning. The best I've seen. Elysium is a pleasure to set up and put away.

Ok game with a nice theme and art. Given, I havn't seen all the cards, nor all the possibilities, but the game felt somewhat boring to me. It's a fine game, it works and offers enough to think about, but it's just not that interesting.

The cards I've seen are straight foward, standard cards you know from other games. Take money, get or convert into points. I had the same feeling/problem with "Deus", which is a nice game, too, but the cards...

Plays pretty fast which is a good thing, but at the same time, there are only 5 rounds to play! You can't do all the things you'd like to.

I guess it's best with 2, but I don't think that I will get the chance to find it out.

This is a game where the mechanics do not fit with the game style.

While this game should be played fast, to actually make good decisions you would have to take a really long time to each turn. All the play, I had no idea how well the other players were doing and it is generally not worth it to block someone by taking his card. The game devolves into a heavily solo experience.

I would be willing to play it again, but there are many, many games that I would player over this.

Simply an excellent card game. You are forced to do a lot with relatively little - in most games you will only get 15 cards over the course of 5 rounds, and they have to be both your points and your combos. Great stuff.

Grabbed this for $30 on sale.  It looks like a good choice--I think I'm going to like this game once I can get it played.  Now that I've played it twice, yes, I do like it, although it is a slow methodical game where every choice matters.  It's a neat game, but slow.  Best with three players.

RATING: 3
In short, Elysium is a card drafting game in which you create mini-engines and need to focus on when you make the shift from engine-to-(endgame-)VP.

This beats 7 Wonders hands down for me as it provides a far richer interactive space -- the cards are drafted from a common area, and the drafting mechanic does allow you to screw your fellow players by denying them choices (there are also just a few take that options as well). However, like 7 wonders, I find the complexity to depth ratio unappealing. By this, I mean that there is so much to process in terms of information, but the processing doesn't necessarily result in more difficult choices. Rather, the overabundance of text+icons on all the different cards means that simple-ish choices become rather opaque. 

I'm not afraid of complex games. However, from complexity, I usually desire depth that is proportional. That's not to say that there isn't depth in Elysium, but rather that it is not in proportion to its complexity (and not in the good way; i.e., simple-yet-deep).

However, the insert for this game is phenomenal - publishers should take note.

Elysium is a nice little set collection game, with very pretty artwork from the team at Space Cowboys, and a decent amount of theme shaken on.

The basic acquisition mechanism is as simple as 7 Wonders- see a card in the market and take it- but with a limiting twist of colors needed to acquire, it also limits purchasing, and adds to more interactive game play.

Seeing and understanding your opponents' choices does make a real difference in this game- not just another multiplayer solitaire.

Money gets to be a tight resource as well, because converting cards into sets requires money (unlike acquisition). It also basically turns off cards' power to affect the game.

But opportunities to move cards into VP sets are also limited, so one can't simply hold all the cards, but must time the value of holding a card vs. possible lack of future opportunities to move it later on.

Between these choices, add the interest (and possible screwage) that can come from taking the card someone else needs, putting them in a corner.  It's got a lot going on with what seems like a few simple choices.

Starting Elysium at a 7.25, with opportunity to climb some based on replayability (this should be fairly high based on mixes of cards from differing god families).

This is good but there is a horrendous amount of in game text and it detracts from the game... starting to get used to the text and symbols now and it's actually pretty decent. I'd like to play it a few more times and start to vary the sets we play with

I can certainly see that with the variety in sets it makes it tremendously replayable (without going nuts like Dominion did)

The first couple times I played this I loved it.  Then the next couple times I loved it less - felt like I was building something only to tear it apart and that there was a lot of activity surrounding what is essentially set collection.  So I put the game away for months and played it again today.  There's a lot of little strategies getting to that set collection, but I can't figure out if that adds depth or just hides a very meh game behind fiddly actions.  The strategies do have me intrigued though so I will continue to play to figure it out - moving from a 6 to a 6.5.

Love it. Don't know what it is, but just how the game plays and how tight it can get in the last 2 epochs makes this a winner for me. The game has beautiful components and artwork, one of the best inserts and has fairly simple, but hard to master, concepts. I only fear that the game may not be supported as much, which would be a shame, since it was very well received. Don't let this one die Space Cowboys!

It's quite annoying that the designers actually had an expansion in the works for this game, but of course Space Cowboys(which is owned by Asmodee...surprise surprise!) doesn't feel Elysium is a hot seller and instead will keep churning out LCG and Eldritch Horror content. It truly makes me sad cause the base offers a lot from the get-go but an expansion will give much more life and longevity.

I really like the way the pillars work.  They will affect not just what you can take now but what you plan to take next time, but of course you don't know which cards will be available then. In any case, I have a weakness for card-drafting games.
There are a lot of things I don't like about the game too, though.  There is SO MUCH INFORMATION on the cards, so not only does it take forever for players to look through them and decide what they're going to do, but it's also really hard to see what they do.  And then, the attack cards are really mean and frustrating.  (1 play)

Elysium is a very interesting game in which players are simultaneously building and deconstructing a tableau of cards.  You must decide when to take apart your card engine because doing so too early or too late will have repercussions. The pillar selection mechanic is elegant, as it is simple to understand, but forces you to carefully map out each turn.

The game is fine: original, smoothly-working, full of dilemmas.

My complaint is that the first half of the game is not so exciting - you grab some cards and hope for the best.  The real fight starts in the second half when you are short of time and abilities to transfer cards to the scoring area.
I'm not sure about the replayability (despite you choose 5 decks out of 8 before each game).  But we'll see.
And there might be something missing for me, personally.  Maybe I just need more games to fall in love.

Very fun card drafting game with strong engine building elements. The game is rather short with only 15 cards drafted so decisions are important from the start. Players have to decide if they will aim for VP or money which will be used to perform set collections (game calls them legends) in hopes for bigger VP returns at end game. The iconography is good so teaching it is a breeze. However the setup and teardown is quite troublesome and the cards at low player counts seems to be quite random with the possibility of certain colors or numbers not appearing at all. You could possibly be screwed from your set collection that way.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (December 2015)

I had big expectations toward the game and, thankfully, Elysium doesn’t disappoint.

The rules aren’t hard to grasp, you can explain them under 20 minutes but the decisions needed aren’t obvious in any way, just the opposite, they are very interesting  (which card to buy, what quest to do, how to pay for them, when to acquire them). I particularly like the “how to pay for cards” mechanism and I find it to be very novel. This is the first time I have seen it and I love it because it decreases your options after each buy so you have to plan carefully and risk your opponents will grab powerful cards. Great stuff.

Love the scoring mechanism, you can have the best cards, but they mean nothing if you cannot move them to your Elysium, this also differentiate the game from most tableau building games.

The playtime is around 90 minutes. Best with 3 players, with 4 I begin to feel the downtime.

The theme is great but I feel most cards don’t convey it very well (It is pasted on). The art is very good as are the game´s components.

I love that each time you play, you only use a subset of the possible cards, that is, Elysium have a very high replayability factor. Many of my favorite games share this feature. Also, thanks to this, the game is easily expandable.
 
Bottom line, Elysium is a good game that features interesting decisions and has a satisfying depth. It has a permanent spot in my game collection. I want to play it again soon.

After more plays, I continue to love Elysium :D. Now I have played with more gods and I really like how Ares and Apollo affect the gameplay. They also add additional game components to play which is great. It is a bit weird (thematically) that Poseidon is the aggressive god while Ares doesn’t do much to your opponents.

Right now I’m loving Elysium, so I’m upgrading its rating.

Looks more complicated than it is. Took about one hour to teach and play my first 2 player game. The game is definitely more on the medium/heavy side as far as decision making goes but mechanically it is fairly simply. The hardest part is getting down the iconography - and there is quite a bit of it. At its core Elysium is a game about balance. What column you discard impacts what cards you can obtain in future turns, how long you keep a card above your Elysium will determine how long you will get a benefit from the card but reduce the chance you will be able to transfer it for points, whether you go for family or level legends - family legends are easier but worth less points. Lots of good decision making in a fairly quick game. Great art and components !

This is a neat card drafting game with some tough decisions and potential for interesting combos.

Good with only 5 rounds. You can mix different decks into the game, change it from turn to turn, or even make it less or more player interactive. There is some really good mechanics here, like how the columns works. The game also have nice artwork (even if the cover isn't that good).

This is close to a 10 for me. But it takes just a little to long with 4 players to get the highest score.

The game is rife with tense decisions. You have only 4 actions each round, three to gain cards from a shared display, and one to select turn order. However, each action you take removes one of the four coloured resources from your possession. Cards need one or two colours to be in your possession to claim them, and each turn order position is associated with one of the colours. You are constantly struggling to spend the right colour so that you get what you want now and still have flexibility for your future actions. Seeing what other people spend is also hugely important.

The turn order serves two important purposes. Going first is good because you get first crack at claiming cards in the next round. However, if you go first you can only move one card from your domain into a legend, which is the only way to score points from the card at the end of the game. Legends are sets which you are trying to put together. Going last allows you to move three cards into legends, but you sacrifice turn order.

Cards also have powers which you can use, but not if you've added them to a legend. There are several 'families' which are each associated with a Greek god. You shuffle together 5 of the families to make the draw deck for the game so there is some variability there.

The core concepts of the game are not unique, but the game is so incredibly well developed. It's simple and it works well. It doesn't hurt that the art is beautiful. This is definitely a game that is greater than the sum of its mechanisms. They have managed to create tense, interactive, and interesting gameplay with an elegant set of rules.

I'm looking forward to playing this a lot more!

So good. The variable setup draw deck is a great way to avoid sameyness between games and all the God decks seem sufficiently different and add some new and interesting mechanics. Love that engine building/breaking mechanic from Abyss and this game handles it even better. And it just seems so expandable (though, really, no room for new decks in that graeat box insert?). Only thing I would caution is that it might not be the best for very thin-skinned or conflict-adverse players. Poseidons deck has a lot of "take that" in it and the Broken Quest mechanic can be brutal if you aren't expecting it. 
EDIT: I guess the designer has said that while he designed an expansion,  it wasn't picked up by Space Cowboys. Sad,  since this game would only get better with more variety.

RATING: 6
In principle, Elysium sounds simple. Take four cards each turn, remove one of your four pawns for each card. Remaining pawns determine which cards still can be taken. Repeat five rounds. The devil is in the detail. In the case of Elysium, it's the text on the cards and their functions. In order to benefit the most from the cards in a player's display and turn these cards into VP winning sets by moving them to a player's Elysium, heavy exercises of the gray matter are needed in this tactical brain burner. Enjoyable under the right circumstances, but I'm surprised that this comparably dry thoughtful, at times confrontational game made the nomination list for the Kennerspiel 2015.

Ultimately, the constant need to read the small print on the cards, the slow pace and the kingmaking potential let me prefer other games and I won't miss it in my collection.

Ho hum theme, somewhat easy to explain. The main problem is that you have to familiarize yourself with all the cards. If everyone knew all of the cards and you could play the game in 25-30 minutes like Dominion, this might be pretty fun. But as it is, there is too much downtime looking at all the cards, and once the cards are purchased, the game is basically solitary.

I don't know why game publishers are afraid to branch out into other themes and persist with pushing stuff like this.

Very pretty and relatively quick playing tactical game with decent replayability level and good comboing chances with an unusually good insert included. The game is built around a clever action drafting system and uses set collection as a means for scoring. There is some healthy take that included and you are probably going to miss a lot of options if you are not familiar with cards and potential combos. It is nice that the gods play so differently to each other and that gives the game a bit of static market deckbuilder feel.

I love card games, engine building and combo-finding in games. The best part about this game is that you take a set of parts, and build two engines, one after the other, with them: you build an engine, and just as fast take it apart to build the second one; not only that, but you must choose pieces which will work in both. It makes for a real nice problem to solve.

Smart game mechanics, but I expected more combos with the cards to create a dilemma about putting the cards on your Elysium or wait. I never have doubts about putting cards in the Elysium. Maybe the gods that were left out of the game have more interesting powers, I'm willing to play the game again to see. The main problem is the amount of information with all the cards layout on the table at the beggining of each turn, which generates some AP. A good game with good art.

Strategy game that brings the Gods down from the heavens and onto the table. Elysium is a PVP euro-style game where the player with the most victory points at the end wins. Strategy is involved so you want to make the right choices that will please the Gods. There are several ways to get victory points and ways to take them away. Whether you help Zeus bring down the skies or Athena man her war, either way will help you score in this game. Once you've played once the game will go by fast in future plays and can easily get 2 games played in an hour and a half. LOVE this game!!!

Very interesting euro with a great multi-tier design. Difficult decisions to make amongst a sea of strategic potential with enough theme amongst the gods to prevent it all from becoming a dry, tasteless euro.

This game does an amazing job from becoming too heuristically obtuse since it keeps removing options during your turn (the column resources) and throughout the game (card bonuses becoming converted to points in your Elysium).

Quite an impressive design overall. Recommended for heavier euro fans.

Too many good things to say about this game. People say it's just a euro. I see it as a fantastic game with fantastic atmosphere and artwork and with a theme (though pasted on) doing a great job in consolidating the whole experience- many little mechanisms associated with specific gods. 

The fact that you can mix any five of eight decks is just great and all the mechanisms work so well together. Each deck brings something specific from other games but altogether they create new experience. The main mechanism of keeping cards in your domain or moving them to Elysium losing their abilities + timing is incredible, not to mention the super interesting cost vs payment system integral to the whole experience. 
Also, the game is great with 2, 3 and 4 players.

Elysium is a game of set collecting and combinations in which players recruit cards representing heroes, items, powers and gods. These cards have many different powers and you can create powerful combination to earn gold (the help of the gods) and victory points (the favor of the gods). Each card belongs to one of the eight Olympians gods (a family), and shows a level (1 to 3).

Components are lovely, overall. I really like handling the pillars and turnorder/quest-tiles.

The downside I see is the majority of the cards just feels bland by themselves with little to no impact. Unless you get a combo going the game tends to drag.

Would like to try it more often but it has proven to be a difficult sell at the table...

RATING: 8
FIRST IMPRESSION:

Two games were played in one day and I enjoyed both. Both games were quite different in game play due to god decks in play. Each of the 8 god decks effect game play quite differently and since only 5 decks are used, there is quite a bit of replayability. Game involves a bit of a draft although you are restricted based on the wood columns you have remaining and the cards are used to combo either in Elysium or while alive depending on the type of card. There are 5-6 different types of cards and then quite a number of different text effects as well. One also drafts a quest and can acquire some money, VPs, and acquires a certain number "elysium permits" which allow one to move a card from your display into your Elysium where set collection generally rules the day. 

I'm not sure this shines as a two player game. There are a ton of cards that never see the light of day and that can wreck things if you are familiar with the god decks and expect certain cards to come into play. Probably best with four, fine with 3, and playable but not ideal with 2.

This is a very good Euro: the rules are simple enough, the iconography is clear (with a small exception for the back of Quests, which have "Transfer + money" instead of "Money + transfer", as if the order did matter). Nicely streamlined. Great insert, nice tokens, nice drawings, very good production. Turns are fast enough (even though an analysis-paralysis prone player can slow things down seriously).

But the game is yet another Euro (albeit a well-done one), without real drama or story, very few combos, very few "ah ah!" moments, thematic integration, etc. A much shorter game of Magic creates many more nice, thematic moments; same for a longer game like Clockwork Wars.

Tableau building and set collection with meaningful interaction, lack of runaway leader, and a good implementation of card drafting, albeit with little theme (although if you are looking for a Euro Greek mythology game, this is more thematic than Deus). I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of interaction in this game. The Poseidon cards are the obvious source, but there are also several other gods who require you to take others into consideration, and even if you discount hate drafting racing to transfer cards into your tableau  before your opponents for bonus points for being first/preventing them from surpassing you in a number set can be critical.

In terms of the drafting, while when reading the rules the pillar mechanic seemed gimmicky, it actually worked quite well to restrict what you can get in future turns. It also allows you to snipe cards so that your opponent has to get a broken legend or a citizen due to their lack of remaining pillars.

This game doesn't has as strong of an engine building feel as most tableau builders, partially because you need to tear down your at least parts of your domain very early in the game to score enough cards, and partially because a lot of cards are either one time use or feel like to modifiers to gold/VPs. This isn't to say you'll have an easy time choosing what to transfer to your elysium, as you can't afford to just wait to the last couple of rounds to transfer, but also because set collection is important, and being first/ahead in some set as before mentioned can give you game-deciding points, forcing you to still transfer cards with ongoing abilities. Just don't expect what you can do each turn to snowball as much as e.g. Splendor.

This game can be AP inducing as while the rules aren't that hard, there are a ton of choices each turn, and it's not helped in the regard that none of the cards seem super overpowered or way too weak to be considered. With the right crowd, this can be a moderately easy to learn game with a good amount of strategy, but it might not suit everyone.

There is variable setup which I like and apparently changing even one god can really affect the game, but I'm going to need more plays to see if that really is the case or if it's going to feel like Dominion without any expansions. There might also be a problem if too many effects feel mundane (+1 gold or point, etc.) rather than e.g. all feeling unique like Seasons, but if it doesn't have that problem this game could be bumped up to an 8. 

EDIT: I like the oracle powers of the Oracle cards, but they seem perhaps a little bit too flexible in allowing you to take the cards/abilities you want. The Hermes cards have some nice utility cards, and I like they feel different from the other gods, as a lot of the -1 gold for everyone else, +1 transfer stuff isn't really cutting it for me for the theme (yes each individual god feels different, but during game play when I barely remember which card belongs to which god the abstract bonuses don't really lend themselves thematically). Ares's PP mechanic is something that has been done many times before, and that almost all his cards is dedicated to making PP work causes him to be probably my least favorite.

I think I like this game best with 3 players. 2 players the Ares 16 vs. 8 bonus can be really swingy, and with 4 players the game drags too much, as not only do you add another player but there are more options for each person to think over.

EDIT 2: Each game I play of this I like it less and less. Really like the amount of interaction, but as stated in my previous edits a lot of the cards seem really bland and samey. Also, while I initially liked the idea that you have to destroy your engine by transferring cards to get points, sometimes (although I stress not always) the game goes too far in that regard and it feels more like just a card drafting set collection game, something that Ooloretto does in a much shorter time.

I think Elysium is one of the reasons that Valley of the Kings has fallen a bit for me. I love the way that it balances keeping cards for their powers and moving them down for points. That entire mechanism is just fascinating to me because you have so many things to consider and balance when making decisions. Plus, I absolutely adore the theme because the Greek/Roman Gods and Goddesses have always been my favorite religion to read about. I also love the selection mechanism with the colored pillars limiting what you can do each round.

A more complex drafting game than 7 wonders but with an interesting twist.   You draft cards if you have columns that match the columns on your board.  You pay with a column of any color.   Drafted cards go to your Domain and then are moved to Elysium where you write legends.  Legends are simple sets of matching colors or numbers.  Cards moved to the legends don't grant any special abilities.  You have five different gods in each game and can choose from 8 different gods that change the game.

This is a strange one. I like the game but am not sure how much I like it. I guess I haven't played it enough as depending on which house of gods you select each time the game will vary greatly. You play each time with 5 out of the 8 available, so there are many variations.

I have enjoyed all of the plays. But sometimes I feel the game takes too long for what it is. You do need to spend a while analysing the cards at the start of each round. But the card selection mechanism, with the retention and discarding of the four coloured pillars is excellent. It does, to me, come across as a kind of splendor on a Russian athletics level of steroids abuse. Make of that what you will, but I do enjoy it!

I've now played 2 of the games up for the 2015 Kennerspiel (also played Broom Service). Both games are great, though I slightly prefer Broom Service for its theme and simplicity. Nevertheless, this game is great. It's funny, I actually played this for the first time at BGG FAM 2015. One of the attendees who had just got done playing with a group of 4 was nice enough to explain the directions to us. Unfortunately, he did an awful job and we almost totally wrote the game off, but I was still intrigued. I'm glad I didn't give up on it! I like several things about this game. What really makes it different though is the card-buying mechanism that it uses and how much meat you get for such a short amount of time. I don't know the intentions of the publisher (Space Cowboys), but I'd be willing to bet that one of their main objectives is making games that can be played quickly. 2 players with minimal AP can knock this game out in about 30 minutes. That's truly amazing for how much game is in this box. Don't get me wrong, it's not heavy, it's not even a "true medium" in my mind (I'd call it a light-medium weight), but it still packs an awful big punch and offers great variability and strategic options. My only complaint (and this is probably the reason I didn't give this game a .5 higher) is that the production quality, though great in the way of nice components, is lacking in terms of quality control. The boards I have are slightly warped, and this is possibly one of two games that I have ever punched and damaged multiple chits in the process. I was not impressed with that at all. But like I said, in the grand scheme of things, that's a small complaint. This one is on the shelf now and looks to stay there for a long while.

This kinda gives me the 7 wonders vibe. Great artwork and an interesting theme. The base mechanics are relatively simple, even non gamers should be familiar with making Runs and Sets of numbers in the Elysium. However, there is a lot going on, and a lot of abilities and symbols. Akin to 7 wonders, i would categorize this as not necessarily a gateway game, but a Next Step game, one step above gateway. The rulebook has preset recommendations for which combination of decks to use, that allow for different styles of gameplay, whether they be cutthroat, high scoring, or having to find non traditional methods of scoring victory points. I enjoy that variety.

The art and game insert are great.  Gameplay is solid, but there's a huge disconnect between theme and application. I don't feel like I'm writing "legends".  In the end, it's collecting cards with abilities.  

Although the mechanics are vastly different, I think I still prefer 7 wonders to scratch the itch.

Pillar mechanic is pretty unique though.

Definitely a step up from other Space Cowboys games, there's LOTS going on here and you really need to play the game couple of time so you don't need to stop and read every card, before that it's bit painful. But it's worth it, the artwork is super nice and there's lots of replayability here.

Not bad from the publisher of Splendor. This is quite a different game, heavier and more varied. Smart system of acquiring cards and then trying to get them moved downward below your board to score points for certain sets.

This was hyped for me, I was hoping for a move enjoyable 7 wonders. The bidding mechnism was intresting but the player interactions wasn't sastisfying. If I'm screwing over my friend I want to do it because it's a good move for me. In this game it can just happen and you feel bad and it's like, well it was my only move sorry. I don't know. Probably worth trying again. It was a fine game to play.

Set collection and drafting game though the drafting is a little restrictive each round as you decided how your choices will be reduced in future rounds which is my fave element of the game.
Every card has a power and there are some fun combo's you can get however i think the card powers complicate the game just a tad too much for my tastes as i prefer family games but i can see this game being one where each time we get it out say every 3 months or so we'll have to again familiarize ourselves with the cards over and over again. But apart from that minor quibble it's a great game! Also if you think this is a game you'll play often then it's probably a really excellent game!

The more times I play this game, the more I appreciate all the intricacies in the game. You are essentially drafting cards to gain abilities, but also to be able to score them at the end of the game, which can only be done by transferring the cards in front of you to your scoring area where their special abilities will no longer be available.

This game has a really neat mechanism for acquiring the cards, as each time you have to give up one of your four pillars, which will narrow down which cards in the pool you can get later on as each card has one or more required pillar to be able to obtain. So you are constantly choosing what you are giving up the chance to get.

I really enjoy this game and can't recommend it enough.

Das Material ist ordentlich. Die Regeln und die Begriffe im Spiel sind ziemlich verklausuliert, was den Einstieg und das Erklären unnötigerweise deutlich erschweren. Beispiel: Warum heißen die zu nehmenden Karten Aufgaben, wenn es nichts zu tun gibt als sie zu nehmen? Oder die zu bildenden Kartenkombination heißen Mythen.

Es ist ein Optimierspiel, aber mit relativ hohem Krübel-Faktor und für meinen Geschmack zu hohem Frustpotenzial. Wahrscheinlich wird es besser wenn man es 10 bis 20 Mal gespielt hat, aber andere Spiele machen schon bei der ersten Partie richtig Spaß. Definitiv kein Familienspiel.

Haut mich jetzt nicht total um, aber ich spiele es gerne nochmal wieder mit.

At first this appeared to just look nice, but simply be yet another bland card game with lovely components and a Greek mythological theme.

After actually playing the game have realised how good it is, in fact I think I definitely prefer it to Five Tribes (or Deus for that matter). They all have that element where you have to wait to see the situation left on your turn before being able to make the optimal choice - but at least here you can make backup plans in advance. Plenty to think about, including Turn order, but not overly stretching or "Analysis Paralysis" inducing (well not quite).

"It felt like turn-based 7 Wonders, with much more complicated card interactions.

I don't see myself playing this again. I can occasionally play 7 Wonders, due to the quick playtime and simple iconography -- there's just too much to read and too much downtime in Elysium, by comparison."

RATING: 6
Has that "many consequences to your decisions" aspect I like. Pretty engaging gameplay that suffers from a couple of drawbacks. First, the pillar mechanism can lead to significant AP (noting myself, here, at least). It would be less if you paid with the matching pillar, rather than planned around which to keep, but that would be less interesting of a game. Second, constantly reading and rereading the cards bogs things down. It's interesting but might be more work than it's worth, and I won't miss it if I'm not playing it.

Another fairly preliminary rating. Beautiful production (including a brilliant insert), a paper-thin theme, and a couple of great design decisions make for a quick-playing but still interesting game. That being said, all of my plays have felt a little...cold, I suppose? I like it, but I'm not on fire about it. Also, the sheer number of card abilities/symbols make the game less suitable as a gateway than I was hoping for. Still, looking forward to seeing more of this one.

RATING: 7.75
Let's start with the little things, but the little things are what separates the good from the excellent and the Insert for this game is just awesome...

Beautiful to look at, with a specific place for everything, space for sleeved cards... an insert that all publishers should look at... functional and beautiful... Kudos for that!

The game plays very very well... can be a bit AP inducing, specially in the first few games when there are a lot of cards on the table and you have to decided what column to use to pay for the card you're picking up, because that will affect what cards or Quest you'll be able to pick next.

I like that hard choice, that moment where you have 10 cards (in a 3P game) on display and you have to select your targets and prioritize your choices taking into account what the other players might be chasing after too... I made a critical error of judgement in the last Epoch and that cost me the game and all because I didn't pay close attention to what cards Duarte had in one of his Legends...

I also love the way the powers work... they can only be used when the cards are in your Domain but you have to transfer the cards to your Elysium because it's there that they will score the points at the end of the game and in each Epoch players will have a limited number of cards they can transfer to their Elysium, so you have to be transferring cards during the game at the expense of possible powers you are giving up because if you don't you can lose valuable bonus points on the Legends you create and also on because, like I stated you can't transfer a lot of cards in one Epoch...

The Gods all have a specific "theme" that suits their "personality" some promote high interactivity between the players, some good like Athens and some bad like Poseidon... 

All gods are very interesting and allow you different ways to play the game, and since there are 8 gods in the box and you only play with 5 each time the replay-ability is huge and the way one game plays will be very different from another game with other Gods in the mix.

And then there's the art of the cards... STUNNING! This is a very beautiful game, a trade mark from [b][company=25842][/company][/b]

Really liked the game and will be playing it again very soon :)

This is what a modern board game should be. Relatively short playing time, tough decisions on simple rules, considerable replayabilitity due to mixing the cards the way you have mood for, lovely theme and each of the 8 god families illustrated by a different person. And nice insert, that's not a standard in this type of games. (Greetings Seasons, another great exception to crappy inserts.)

The only downside is the schematic graphics is sometimes too schematic and the two halves that compose the player board don't fit exactly graphically. Also, preparation and teardown could be a chore, but it's hard to find a nice rich game without such chore.

Dominion, Deus, Tournay, Harbour, Bruges, Spyrium, Elysium, Imperial Settlers, Abyss, etc...

These are all offshoots from the same game.  Variable cards that generate points or acquisition power and that players can "combo" in order to "engine-build".  The games differ in how they implement the mechanics: shared deck vs. personal deck; shared tableau vs. personal tableau; fixed cumulative tableau vs. temporary tableau with final victory vault.  Some include more than 1 resource type (Imperial Settlers), some include a form of board that does very little in the game (Deus, Abyss, and Bruges), some include workers that can be placed out (Tournay and Spyrium).  Ultimately they are all; grab card, add to existing card, twist card, twist other cards, generate resources, acquire points.   

Most of these games do not implement theme well. As I said, they feel like the same game.  Winning or losing the game matters little, its more about the combos and the engine.  Player interaction varies to a certain degree, but I would argue in that these are at their heart solitaire games with a score comparison at the end, but the other players only serve to further the game to its conclusion.

Elysium has a moderate degree of player interaction, shared deck, personal tableau, no theme, flexible tableau with victory card vault, no board, 1 resource type, and no worker placement.  Of the games of this type it is tolerable and not that boring.  It lacks tension and you will not care whether or not you win the game, but you will marvel at your engine and the combos.  Another reviewer put it aptly - a rummy drafting game.

Plays smooth, and is a relatively simple ruleset for a card combo game. Most of the difficulty in learning and playing lies on card text and the two types of legends, for those not familiar with rummy. Like Race for the Galaxy, the cards have symbols and miniscule text explaining them, so expect a slow first few games while players learn the cards as they come into play.

Decent game, but nothing revolutionary. Sort of feels like Smash Up mixed with 7 Wonders. After one play I was lukewarm on it. On my second play, I started to enjoy myself. On my third play though, I was pretty much done with it. The game does have tense decisions, but beyond that I wasn't overly impressed. There are too many cards to choose from, and most of them do the same old tired Euro set collection things you see in every other game out there. The one hook that this game does is restrict the colors of cards you're allowed to take, which isn't a fun mechanism when used artificially. The overall experience just feels very hollow and unsatisfying.

Set collection game with an interesting "bidding" mechanism - you need to show one of your four colored pieces but pay with any of them for the cards but also for the turn order (and you'll always feel that you paid with the wrong color).

Interesting example of set collection gameplay. Notable for including plenty of chits, game aids, card trays and gorgeous artwork. As in most games of these types the theme is rather irrelevant and merely an excuse to unify somehow the decks of cards, but the presentation puts it above most of the clones of the genre.

I guess its up to the final user to decide if he's willing to fork premium pricing on what's essentially an expensive, big-box edition of Fairy Tale. But hey, it plays ok.

RATING: 7
Each epoch, players are drafting cards and turn order. At the end of each epoch, players can transfer some of their cards into their Elysium, which will score points. The cards are numbered 1-3, and you can have sets of 1-2-3 or all 1's, 2's or 3's. Points are awarded for the length of the set or who was the first one to do it. Cards in your domain give you certain abilities to use. 

It's a fun game. The only things that prevent this from being a really good game are: 1) there are some cards which target other people, 2) you do have to read the cards, so playing with someone who is slow will bog the game down. There are many combinations which can make a player's turn slow as well. 3) It's not clear that a 1 VP difference offset for the player going first is enough.

It's interesting to try the different families (each game you have 5 familes out of a possible 8). It's a bit longer than I like, but worth a try.

Great thematic integration in every aspects of the game and nice material (even the box!). Extremely solid 2-player game but a 4-player game may SEVERELY suffer the AP syndrome.

I'm really looking forward for expansions to add more complexity to the current mechanics. Bring on Dionysus!

I've had a real hard time trying to figure out what to say about Elysium. I mean, its got nice artwork and decent components, it integrates its theme well, and the game play is solid, but there is nothing spectacular about it, so why do I like it?

For one, the pantheon of Greek gods included is diverse, and each 'family' of cards thematically fits its representative god well. Special props to the publisher, Space Cowboys, for including more than the minimum number of 'families' for play, rather than holding them in reserve to be released as expansions for additional monies. This improves Elysium's variability and replayability.

The real heart and soul of Elysium are the colored pillars each player has. The affect they have on decision-making is profound, adding a layer of strategy to what is basically a simple set collection and card drafting game without significantly increasing complexity.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Elysium is an interesting game.  You start with four different colored totems that allow you to pick up different cards that belong to different god decks.  Once you decide to acquire a card it remains above your player board with its unique special ability intact.  

The goal of the game, however, is to get these cards into the bottom section of your player board where their powers will be gone, but they will score you points at the end of the game.  The cards come in 1s, 2s, and 3s all in different god decks.  If you acquire 5 different 1s (all from different gods) you will score, if you acquire a 1 and 2 and 3 all from the same god, you will score.

The game is a bit odd, but I thoroughly enjoy this is a two player experience with a few cards dealt out.

RATING: 8
This deserves it's nomination for the awards. I really like the tension of using the right pillars, drafting the cards at the right time, and trying to hold off on what you really want, because you need to take something from someone else. This'll be in my collection and it'll be there a long time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A good game, but there's so much there. So many cards broken into so many families, that may only be acquired via a novel auction mechanic, that you may want to collect for any of a number of reasons (set collection, engine building, thwarting, desperation, because nothing else was left, combination of the above). As with most auction games, it pays to observe what people want, what they can afford, but doing so in this game can prove overwhelming a few rounds in. Jury is still out as to how frequently this game ought to be played, but it's possibly very frequently (like San Juan frequently).

I really enjoy this game. Set up can be a little long. Also, I find the insert odd. It's nicely done, but does not fit all the tokens in a way that makes them easy to remove. 

But the game itself is really nice. I actually prefer the 2 player version, even knowing the issues other people have mentioned.

It plays very fast with 2, and I have found the rules easy to teach (the round structure is actually pretty easy).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.3
Medium lo light set collection card game with an elegant ruleset. The components are high quality, big wooden pieces and the cards have really nice illustrations. I just wish the symbology would be a bit more intuitive, but there are few symbols anyways and they are easy to memorize.

It's a completely abstract game about picking cards with limited resources and packets of benefits during five rounds. There are quite a few ways to score points, but the main way is to form set collections.

I don't think the game it's as deep as people say, but it features meaty decisions in a relatively fluid gameplay and creates an ambient tension during the pick phase of each round.

I don't like...
-> There are cards that are WAY better than the others. They give an insane ammount of points compared to the others to any player, not just the one that is playing some kind of preset strategy. You get a couple of these and the game is pretty much over. Why did the designers give so much importance to being first? But you can be first and get nothing... Then it's just a matter of who happens to be first when these cards appear?
-> The citizen option is not compelling enough. -2 points (+ paying it) is too hard of a punishment to make it worth even as a secondary choice.

The citizen issue is not really important, but the first one makes no sense to me. Turn order would already be important enough if the cards were balanced: you make 4 important picks with that player order, plus you take the risk of not being able to pick a benefit packet and being forced to deal with the secondary greatly reduced one.

It includes 8 families (suits of cards) and you only use 5 in each game. The powers of the cards of each family gravitate around a theme. This adds to its replayability, even if the luck of the draw would be enough to grant no 2 games will be the same.

Ambitious design; Space Cowboys is certainly turning out to be worth keeping track of.

Needs more playings for the rating to settle: With the blue take that deck the game is slightly annoying and AP prone. On the other hand, without the blue deck it might prove to be a solitairish optimization exercise. I definitely need to try this one again.

The box insert is quite impressive both artistically and functionally, and designed to hold sleeved cards.

Gioco più strategico del previsto.

I'm a big fan of the designer and his ability to streamline a game design, but Elysium seems to be lacking in anything really new and also succumbs to excessive combo-mania. The mythological theme seems pasted on, despite the best efforts to integrate it. 

There also seems to be an excess of luck for something that should be more clinical. At times, being the start player will not be a particular advantage, but depending on the card draw it could grant you access to a double-point swinging card.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I haven't had as many plays of this as I would like, partly because I'm not sure the game is quite as good with two compared to three or four. However; every time t hits the table I have a great experience, the variability of the different decks really changes how the game is played and which strategies you will try. Both of my kids enjoy this one as well and there is a fair amount of player interaction especially when going after bonuses, deciding which columns to use and making sure you aren't handing someone the game by allowing them to get a group of cards that will score oodles of points. To some up the interaction it is both in card denial and directly stealing from other players or forcing them to take a broken legend tile. There is a great engine building component with some innovative mechanisms (I really enjoy figuring out when to move cards from your active tableau to your Elysium). 

If you haven't had a chance to try this one yet I highly recommend it. Also my daughter was 10 when she started playing this and has a few wins under her belt.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Different take on a tableau builder because cards are activated if they are in your Domain, but will only score you end game points if they are moved to your Elysium.
- You can drastically change the way the game plays out based on which of the decks you use.
- The Apollo deck is a must play, it introduces the oracle which allows you to see upcoming cards for future rounds.
- The artwork is excellent, I appreciate the decision to have different artists illustrate each separate deck.
- The last round can go a bit long because you need to make sure you get everything done before the game ends. 
- Similar to other tableau builders there are a lot of card abilities you need to pay attention to. 
My ease of play list for tableau builders which goes from virtually no upkeep to almost too much: Race for the Galaxy -> Deus -> Elysium -> Imperial Settlers.

So far I am really enjoying my plays of Elysium, I love the variability introduced into the game in the form of the different decks. It does have a lot of info to keep track of, but the iconography is really good and you really don't need to refer to the rule book. I'm looking forward to more plays and I really want to try the 2p game and see how it goes. Tableau builders are one of my favorite types of games and I'm glad to have another good one to pull off the shelf. Time will tell if Deus, Elysium and Imperial Settlers will all manage to stay in my collection.

Thoughts on the Kennerspiel this year: I think Broom Service won because it offers a very streamlined play experience without the need for a lot of turn to turn upkeep and maintenance. It probably also helped that the base game can easily be taught, but there is the option to add in the extra tiles, etc. to give you a meatier experience. Overall I think I would probably give the nod to Broom Service, but it is close since I have really enjoyed both games.[/i]

RATING: 7
An intriguing game that I was really drawn into for the first couple of plays. However The theme is SO badly integrated that someone like me who will choose mechanisms over theme had a hard time figuring out why the cards made any sense. You essentially just read cards and buy the ones you think fits your strategy best. You don't really care what they are.

I found it an oddly "silent" gaming experince where our group usually will talk amongst ourselves even if the game has low interactivity. But not this game, We just play it in silence, which means I will ultimately end up choosing other games going forward.

There is a lot of variability, but as other people have mentioned that once you find your favorite combination you stick to that, unless you are hell bent on keeping the game varied.

Hmm not to my liking, too simple yet at same time complex due to card text and interaction.

My advice to anyone reading this & thinking about buying it:

If you do not like 7 wonders, do not buy this game.

RATING: 8.5
I believe the theme of Greek Gods is sufficiently worn out in popular culture so I met this game with a hefty amount of skepticism. But I really, really love this game. Elysium works as a more focused and smaller scaled 7 Wonders; it plays fast for being a card-drafting game. The artwork and components are gorgeous and never superfluous. But my favorite part of the game is how thematically integrated the Greek Gods are to their respective decks. You want victory points? Zeus is your guy because he's historically all about the glory. Want to be vindictive and ruin your opponent's strategy? Poseidon's got your cover. Want to balance that out with being fair and generous to your opponents? The presence of Athena, the goddess of fair play and democracy, will benefit all players. A seriously great card-drafting Euro. I can't wait for the expansions! More Gods please!

RATING: 8
Lovely game with great artwork
many decisions on whether to put your cards
in the elysium to get the bonus points first or
to keep them in your domain for the repeated actions.
also choosing only 5 of the eight families each time
you can decide if you want to play nasty and use the
poseidon (blue) cards,play with the oracle Apollo (green)
or use the prestige points Ares (red)personally i prefer to use all three also watching what pillars other people are discarding so you dont end up with no quest card
having written all this have convinced myself to upgrade this game from a 7 to 8

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The game has a fantastic inner tray and I thought the bidding mechanism with the coloured pillars was interesting but the game was just somehow underwhelming. Plus I really couldn't be bothered to read all the tiny text on over a dozen cards each round. Doubt I will bother playing again as I like my games to be fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This rating has potential to rise because there are a lot of things to like in the game. For starters, by each game taking a different slant by including only 5 of the 8 provided suits in a game, providing different effect families to explore. Also the first playing is tarnished by undue downtime - all the cards being revealed at once means there's time spent working out what all the effects are, rather than using the drip-feed process that most card-effect games provide to circumvent the issue. I like how there's a decision to make on which colour to discard each turn, which gradually narrows card taking options and causes hard decisions. Those decisions can create more downtime as well though while you check out what your opponents are likely going for vis a vis what colours they've discarded so far. The other issue is that a lot of the deck is not going to come out, so it's highly possible for a player to be pus'd out of completing a set because the needed card didn't come out in the last half of the game, and other players get lucky. Which felt like a touch too much luck for the length of the game and the downtime. Once you're past that, and you're ok with the fact that yes, it's a card drafting game with a rummy scoring system and so yes, there's going to be luck, the nice things about the game are that it's a clean system with a different twist on card collection (ie the colour discards) that's enjoyable to explore. The rules are great, and the card glossary answered all our questions as we went. I'm looking forward to seeing if the game improves with repeat play, and with fewer than 4 players.

Decent game that I enjoyed playing and would not mind playing again, but a game I don't feel pressed to own. It is gin rummy with powers on the cards and a neat auction mechanic.

Elysium is a card-drafting set-collection game in which you collect a bunch of cards with special abilities, but can no longer use the special abilities once you score them as part of a set.  The "resources" you need to take a card come in the form of colored pillars, each of which can be used once a round.  Based on which pillars a player has left, as well as what sets they're going for, it's pretty easy to screw opponents out of the cards they need, if you're so inclined.  There are a number of different sets of cards, only some of which are used in each game.  Each card set has its own flavor, and the "Poseidon" set, which features really nasty take-that, is for some reason in the "recommended for beginners" group.  I didn't mind the draft sniping so much, but that on top of the take-that Poseidon cards really left a bad taste in my mouth.

RATING: 8
Card drafting where all the cards are visible and card combos/actions once you acquire them. The game is simple using only 4 colored action pawns for each player, but watching what players discarded for their action pawns, the colors of cards/tiles on the table and what you actually want is both fun and mindnumbing for such a simple game.

I do wish this game had an expansion as using 5 of the 8 decks each game might end up getting a touch stale down the road. Still, you only use about half the deck each time you craft a set of 5, so there is plenty of variability that way. Still, having a few more decks would leave to a TON more replayability.

Light civil game, revolving around hand management and card drafting. It offers huge replayability, as you won't see a lot of cards during the game, which could be a turn-off for some people, though. It constantly puts you into the dilemma "[i]create an engine vs get the sets you want[/i]", but overall plays very smoothly. However, it leaves you with the taste that you didn't have the time to accomplish enough. It's not very long, but with inexperienced players it can last a lot (~90 minutes) for what it offers.

I would not recommend playing this with four players if it's all new players. Downtime is a bit much.

I prefer this game with 2 players. For now at least. Because of the downtime.

++ 8 gods makes for a lot of variety and therefore a high replayability
+ nice artwork en nice components
+ rules are straightforward and easy to explain
- text on the card is in a very small print
-- There will be, no matter how experienced you are, a lot of AP in this game as you have to figure out which columns to keep and you have to take into account which other possibilities your opponents still have, especially concerning the quests. I would therefore never play this with 4.

Over expensive, soulless card game...

The game mechanics has been done a few hundred times. The gameplay is such a boring fest of card manipulations... do this, take golds, remove that, add this, bla bla bla piece of crap.

Although you can read greek mythology references, the gameplay is absolutely themeless as there's nothing that you do in this game that feels like you are using Athena or Hares, etc. It could have been Deck A, Deck C or Deck F, it wouldn't matter at all.

The only good thing about this game is the artwork, which is really great. But great artwork does not make a game or even saves it.

Garbage ! I recommend playing Imperial Settlers, Deus, Abyss, Splendor over this game any day of the week.

Very disspointed as I had high expectations of this game. And after 3 games, I had enough of this boring junk.

From video reviews another maths and colour maze to advance further in vps while trying to slow or block opponents. Coincidently shares the same 'discard to score but lose effect' as another Ancient themed card game - Valley of the Kings. Seems best to play with 3 or 4 for tense competition and with certain decks (Oracle and Hermes). Interested in the Myth geneaology and I want to buy for the art alone.

To be honest, as of now I only wanted it because of the art. 

UPDATE: Seeing how this game's theme is completely disjointed from its mechanics, I'm not as excited about it as before. I do like my mechanics though. I'll have to try this one out.

UPDATE 2: After going through a number of the cards and their abilities, I can say they at least tried to make them make thematic sense. I may bite on this one. The great production and seemingly solid gameplay may be worth it. We do love our combo/engine building, tactical, tableu builders. Plus, that insert is amazing.

P: 2-4, T: 60 min (seems low, especially if people are unfamiliar), KenSdJ-N

+engine building, card collecting combo and set building, variable set up, card/resource timing management, "turn angst". Very low luck influence/outcomes. Unique card purchasing mechanics.

=Higher complexity, although easy to grasp basic mechanics there needs to be familiarity with card powers in order to score well, lots of different cards to remember. Greek mythology theme is well researched, but a bit thin. Card selection mechanic is a bit fresh, but a bit of a brain burner and subject to AP. Strategy trumps tactics.

-Rule complexity shows in gameplay videos were hosts make numerous errors. Probably too complex for most of our table guests. Familiarity/experience with game/cards will create a large skill gap in games. Several ways to play aggressively. One deck has gotcha mechanics. Lots of iconography which isn't terribly intuitive.

RATING: 6
Everyone seemed to want to like this game more than they actually did. The idea of the game is that players sort of draft cards from a central faceup area, but each time you take a card you discard a resource pillar, and each card has a resource pillar requirement, so as you select things you limit your further selections. This is an interesting and AP inducing element of the game. The cards all have cute abilities that build on each other, but cards only score for you when they are banked into sets. When a card becomes a part of a banked set, it's ability no longer works. There are very few opportunities each game to bank cards, and there are large rewards for players who manage to bank a set of each type before everyone else does, so you are sort of always building and then destroying your engine, which I found somewhat frustrating. The other issue is that some cards are so weak as to have their ability be 'get a dollar' and others that are so strong as to grant the player a ton of extra points. For example, there is a scoring money card that gives you points for leftover dollars. If you get that, great. If not, extra dollars are just tiebreakers. One player in our game managed to collect a set of '1s' cards that alone gave him more points than any other player had accumulated across all their cards. This seemed especially strange as the 1s cards are the cheapest to bank. All in all, I think I'd rather play Deus in it's slot.

A fast and unique card "drafting" game where keeping an eye on your opponent's plans is probably more important than making your own. Racing to create legends before your opponent while trying not to let them step on your toes while exhausting your precious pillars makes this a great tactical experience. I really enjoy how different the game feels based on the five factions you choose to mix into the deck, and they are all fun in their own way. This is prime for some great expansion material, but there's a lot of fun to be had with just the base set.

A bit "meh". Nothing too intriguing. Simply playing this game just isn't a fun experience.

The game system is very abstract. It takes time to read through the cards and learn all the symbols in your first game. Playing with new players is a bit too slow compared what you get out of this game. The basic turn structure is nice but it leads to a bit too slow playing game, at least this seems to be the case with new players and the game doesn't flow like it should. This game a bit too tactical. It is impossible to plan ahead safely too much which leads  to a feeling of tightness but also unnecessary AP-risk. 

It is a decent card combo/set collection game but eventually a very dry and abstract experience even though the artwork and components are nice. I don't think there is any deeper game under the surface.

I have only managed to play this twice so far, but I enjoyed both of those games, and none of the others in my group seemed to dislike it (which is rarer than you might think with games I enjoy...). The rules are relatively simple but lead to a variety of interesting decisions, as regards to which cards and quests to draft, in what order, and which columns to remove each time. There are a nice variety of scoring options too - but you can't pick a strategy ahead of time because you have to react to which cards come out, and you can't plan your entire game around one or two cards which you get early, because you'll probably move them to your Elysium (where they are worth VPs but no longer give you access to their abilities) pretty soon. I also really like the variety inherent in choosing 5 out of 8 sets of cards, each of the 8 having its own particular flavour.

All in all, while I certainly don't see this rivalling Dominion or Race for the Galaxy (both almost flawless classics imo) among my favourite card games, I think it's an excellent game with lots of potential.

I came later to getting into this game. It really consolidated for me how much I enjoy set collection games. I have read the mixed views but to me the underlying simple scoring system of making the 2 kinds of legends really anchors the game. The interaction in my group is constant and lively. Will be interesting to see if I can grow interest in other players because the card texts can be a bit OTT aT first. Also only playing 3 player at present. I wonder if 4 player will be tougher with more competition for the legend bonuses.

A neat drafting game.  Most if it is straight forward, but the pillar mechanic makes you think interestingly about the timing of your drafts.  I worry that as you know the game better it will slow down as you spend more time studying details of others' likely preferences.

The rule book has some to be desired, but a we picked up the game without too much effort.  It's unique scoring and turn order make for some difficult decisions every epoch, I like that it gets the grey matter working.  The balance between scoring effectively and blocking others plays is difficult to master.

We were so excited for this game when we got it, but it really ended up being a very average game.  It seems like there is so much potential here with getting awesome card combinations in your tableau.  The problem is that you have to then get rid of those cards and put them in your Elysium if you want to get any points in the game.  So if you are playing to get a lot of points, then you just don't ever have very many cards left to make combos with.  The trade off there seems interesting in theory, but falters in practice.  Putting the cards into your Elysium just makes the powers on the cards much less interesting.  We also found that it didn't work as well for 2 players as it does for 3 or 4, which is another mark against this game for us.  We tried some variants to make that better, which definitely helped the two player experience, but we still did not enjoy the game. We tried hard to give this game a fair shot and play it 5 times, but after 3 plays we just did not like it and didn't want to play it any more. So we traded this away for Viceroy and Star Realms.

The tension between keeping cards alive for their abilities or killing them for points is very interesting, and makes card-buying really dynamic. Maybe there's a card with a great ability that's useless for scoring, or vice versa, and trying to synergize those two aspects of the game is fascinating.

RATING: 7
Four little auctions for special cards in each of the five rounds, then activate the cards at the appropriate times, then move cards down to the Elysium for end game scoring - Valley of the Kings style. Only sets of levels or families you've moved into your Elysium count for scoring.

Generally the pace is quick, with moments bogged down by turns when you can perform multiple action combos. Games come in under 90 minutes - less when you're familiar with the cards.

Lots of replay value - only five of the eight decks being used per game. Expansions are sure to be on the horizon.

Good game. I like it quite a bit, but it's a game I'll need to play frequently to enjoy. Early days and it feels overwhelming and confusing at times if I'm planning the combinations just right. (One player likened it to Race for the Galaxy in terms of icons and combos, and I think that's a fair comparison.) It certainly requires a bit of concentration during play. Plenty of choices, risks and rewards. A little bit of attacking - how much depends upon decks chosen to play with - some of which you can prepare for or counter. A bit daunting at first with all the card abilities, but you soon begin to recognise the symbology and the game should play smoothly after the first outing or two. Worth playing playing back to back with different decks.

Will I keep it? Not sure. Not sure if this is a game the kids would like because there's a lot to choose from each turn - almost too much for them. They're keen on Valley of the Kings - which seems similar to this to me - but this is a lot more involved. (At the start of a round with four players there are four starting options and at least 13 cards to choose from - potentially more if you have certain trigger actions stored up from previous rounds.) I like it, but I'm not sure it'll get a regular audience around here. Without regular exploration I'm not sure how enjoyable it'll be. Certainly not one to play with AP prone players. Certainly I'm keen to explore more, so keep it for now.

This essentially a tableau building game and I really like tableau building games. I especially like the interesting timing decisions this game offers. For instance if a card is in my domain its ability might be benefiting me, but I can not wait too long to transfer it or I will run out of transfer options. The balance of knowing when to keep a card out and when to convert it to end game points is a very interesting one. I also like the built in replayability. Each play requires a deck built of five suits, but there are eight available suits in the game. This variety will ensure we come back to this game multiple times.

A very fun game that was as good as I had hoped.  Set collection usually isn't my thing, but it is really done well.  The different card mixes ensures that games will be varied from one another and you can definitely tell when a certain family of cards is missing.  Excellent game with a very good chance to go up with future plays.

Excellent game that I will play before many other older and more established games.  Great risk/reward managing and lots of variety.  A great, accessible game!

Mix and match - the game! 

Take an arbitrary spread sheet, distribute some random powers, none too powerful and all kinda samey, cut into pieces and shuffle. Then make 7 more decks like this, because it's very important to play each game just with 5 decks out of total 8 as each combination brings a [i]totally different[/i] flavour to game. Add to that some arbitrary randomly assembled mechanisms that take care of distribution of the cards and their path through the several domains to the end destination - point scoring nirvana. Along the way there's another mechanism that eliminates certain tactical options which should supposedly create tension and hard, thinky choices. I would say this mechanism is pasted on, except it's hard to make such a claim in a game like this - there is no core onto which parts or theme could be pasted on as everything is just parts pasted next to one another. There's no theme, there's no narrative, there's no strategy, there's no focus and no logic. It's just a sum of random mechanisms printed on cards, shaken and stirred. 

The good part is that the game isn't too convoluted and complicated and there's isn't a multi step process to get to anything. Illustrations attempt a nice try at diverting the attention away from nonexisting core of the game. 
Seasons is a better game than this. And I hate Seasons. 
Question: How many more bland games like this do we need? 

[i]P.S.: On RFTG comparisons by a certain video commentator. While both games have many unique cards, that's where every likeness ends. RFTG is a strategic game which a pretty streamlined structure of cards (2 types + 5 phases), Elysium is a completely tactical game and card powers lack any coherence. Thing is - card powers are all kinda samey, yet different, but it's hard to even glance at everything available each turn, let alone figure out card synergies, or even figure out what other players are up to. But lucky for you card powers don't matter that much, nah, you just nede colour or number sets to score points. So mostly you'll be glancing at the numbers and colours to complete your sets, occasionally noticing card powers. Does this sound anything like RFTG to you mr. Zee? [/i] 

Rating down to 1.0 because: Uninspired. Yeah it's a crime. Especially when the game throws a lot of bling for you to not notice how bland and idea-less it is.

Great game! I like the means of collecting the cards and having to sacrifice one of your pillars each time, meaning you needed to plan ahead. The tension of when and which turn order thing to take is great too. I'm totally blanking on what the actual names of those were. This game gave me similar feelings as Abyss and 7 Wonders, a couple of my favorites. Definitely need to play this one more!

It's a good game of it's type. However, it didn't feel particularly exciting. It's reminiscent of 7 wonders and Splendor, two games which I'm luke-warm towards. There's certainly avenues of strategy to explore. In the "Engine-building tableau" style games I prefer Imperial Settlers, Race for the Galaxy, Spyrium, and others. 

Overall I liked it, but I wouldn't be itching to play it regularly.

Fun game. My first impression was Splendor on super steroids, which isn't exactly fair, as there's a lot more going on with this game. You're acquiring cards, trying to get cards that will give you in game powers, and then retire those cards to give you end game points. The beautiful card art gives you a bit of theme but it's pretty pasted on. I'd like to get to know the game better as I think learning how the cards work and interact is key to winning.

RATING: 8
Really quite good, with a couple of nice original touches to make this a little special. The biggest thing here is the use of the columns in order to obtain the cards. You can acquire any card as long as you have those colored columns in play. However, each round, you remove one column and it doesn't even have to be the one from the combination that you used. The selection of which column to remove then becomes really interesting as it will ultimately eliminate you from being able to acquire certain cards or the ability to bank cards for scoring at the end of the round. You then also combine this with cards having actions after you've acquired them, but you lose the ability to take those actions after you score them to add another critical decision point, and between those two critical items, you've got a solid set collection game.

2 plays, basic game: 1 4er, 1 2er

This game has been compared to Deus, although I really don't see a strong connection. In Deus, you acquire cards pretty randomly, the cards are only in 5 basic flavors, they activate only when you play something of the same type (plus initially), and there is a board with relevant positional play. Elysium has none of those things. Instead, you acquire cards more or less in a draft (5 times), there are many different card effects, and there is no board play at all! The most interesting thing, I think, is the draft: you are constrained by your remaining columns, which everyone can see. So you have some guidance in choosing which cards to take, and when. 

Interesting game, but I would like to try with the "advanced" gods. It's also better with more players, so you see more cards in the Agora and can build bigger sets.

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
At the start of the game, place 2-4 tiles (1/player) in the display. Players each get a random turn order tile. Choose 5 gods to play; shuffle all those cards to create a draw deck. Each player gets a pedestal board.

At the start of each (of 5) round, create an "agora" of 3n+1 cards. Players each get 4 column tokens (red, blue, green, yellow). 

In turn order, take either a tile (if you have none already) or a card from the agora. To claim something, you must have an available column of the color(s) shown on the card. After claiming, discard [i]any[/i] one of your available columns. After 4 turns, everyone must have claimed 1 tile and 3 cards. If you cannot claim a card (missing appropriate columns), take a face down "citizen" card from the draw deck. May not have multiple copies of exactly the same card in your domain. If you cannot claim a tile, claim one of the remaining tiles face down. All claimed cards go ABOVE your pedestal, in your "Domain". 

During those turns, you may use card powers of cards in your Domain. These range from single-use to once/turn to always-on powers, and do a variety of things like give you money, earn VP, force players to discard cards, etc. -- each god has its own flavor of power.

After the 4 claims, adjust turn order based on the tiles taken. Then, in turn order, players may make transfers of cards from their domain to their Elysium -- the area below the pedestal -- up to the number of cards specified on the tile. Each transfer costs 1 gold per card number (1-3 total). In the Elysium, cards go in sets: either all the same color (god) but different numbers (1-3), or all the same number but different colors (5 in game). Once in a set ("legend"), they never move. Citizens are wild; pay 1-3 gold depending on what they are substituting for The first 2 complete sets of each god type earn the player(s) bonus VP chits (5/2 for 1st/2nd). For sets of 1s, 2s, and 3s, a different bonus chit goes to the player with the largest set (min size 2; keep token unless size of set is exceeded).

At the end of the game, all cards in the Domain are discarded, as are Elysium sets with only 1 card. Then, score VP according to type and size of set. Lose 2VP per citizen in your Elysium. The player with the highest sum of in-game and end-game VP wins!

This is one of those sweet spot games when it comes to gamers and non-gamers alike.  There is enough here for a gamer to find entertaining and challenging but it is still accessible enough for new gamers to learn, understand, and even do well at.  In that respect I get why many have compared it to 7 Wonders.

Each round of this game players will have 4 columns of different colors and a set of cards is available for players to purchase as well as quests.  The cards and quests each require players to still have one or more columns on their board.  After purchasing a card or quest the player needs to discard one column of their choice.  The cards players draft is the meat of the game.  Each card belongs to one of 5 different families and one of 3 levels.  They each provide some kind of bonus or benefit to the player while it is above their board (where it goes after purchase).  But after the purchase phase players have the option to transfer cards below their board where they will score based on sets at the end of the game but they also lose the abilities on that card for the rest of the game.

The components and artwork are really good and I love the insert.  I will say the game is much better with more players.  At just two the purchase phase becomes pretty easy and we were never forced to take citizen cards or incomplete quests (which is what happens when you don't have the columns necessary to purchase a card or quest).  Also, so few of the cards are seen in 2 player games which can make completing certain sets frustrating.

Simple drafting and set collection game gussied up with a lot of special power cards and point-salad frou frou: family game depth with gamer's game complexity.

Each round, players draft cards to their "dominion", where most special powers will take effect (some persistent, some requiring tapping, some once-off). The goal is to transfer them to Elysium (at monetary cost), where they are worth points but powers no longer function (except for some relating to end of game scoring). Naturally there are bonuses for doing various different things first.

Insofar as a hodgepodge can have a centre, the central mechanism of Elysium is the drafting. Each player has 4 widgets of different colours, and each card has 1-2 colours associated with it. A player can only draft a card if they still have all colours on it, but after each card draft one widget (not necessarily of a colour on the card taken) must be discarded. Managing the order of widget discard is agonizing, and far more interactive than the AP-inducing choice of special powers surrounding it.

The game comes with eight Olympian-themed "houses" of cards, of which five will be used, so a different subset of abilities is available each game. They synergize, but less than might be expected; there are relatively few cards drawn and played, and large engines are contraindicated by the need to move cards to Elysium for scoring. The result is that it's not particularly engaging as an engine-building experience.

As a light set collection game, however, it's really quite good, and should shine with players experienced enough to know the cards and understand how the decks work. Play ought to speed up as players no longer need to read every card, but I'm not convinced it's worth the large number of plays required to reach that point.

Played regularly to the point that it becomes a "super filler" my rating might raise to a 7; played infrequently or with new or slow players, where it's more likely to take two hours than one, it's a 4.

When I first read the rules, they said the game took place over 5 epochs. I was thinking, wow, this is going to be a really long game. An epoch sounds, well, LONG. My son and I finally sat down to try this, and we both said, "Wait, we're already on the last epoch. There's still stuff to do!" Evidently time in the Elysium plains runs much differently than in Steph's brain. We both enjoyed this, and it took just the right amount of time.

Mixed feelings on it. One game was very fun, but another was really long and stagnate. I think there are a few Gods that simply make the game worse (like the one that adds the oracle cards or whatever). Will have to try it again to get a good feel, but from my plays it wasn't bad at all.

A card drafting & set collection game where each card has a specialty ability that may or may no have any use to you. This reminds me of a cross between Splendor and Dale of Merchants. Except I prefer both those games.

tl;dr: the movie was better

real tl;dr: solid game but some AP issues

This game continues the line that Space Cowboys has been building: medium weight strategy games that could also be enjoyed by families with some gamer experience. This one is a bit less streamlined and maybe even a bit deeper than their previous offerings. This mainly comes from the big range of different cards and the combos that come with them. There also is a good amount of Donald X influence with different sets of cards in each game. All great. The game offers nice strategic choices and variation and doesn't go on for too long, but it could have been a bit shorter. The main reason for that is that with all the variability in cards there is quite some time needed for players to evaluate which cards to acquire, which resources to spend and keep in doing so and which cards to move on to the Elysium for end game scoring. This results in more AP than you would expect form a game like this, resulting in a playing time that is a bit longer than I had hoped. It's not problematic and I still enjoyed the game, but it keeps the game from being great and keeps it in the good category.

Initial rating after just one play (4 p). LOVED it! This game is great on so many levels: artwork to die for, love the Greek mythology theme, gameplay is smooth and involved. Rules are straightforward, after one round you get the hang of it. The fact that the base game offers 8 families but you only use 5 each game makes for hughe variety and replayability and makes every game challenging, trying to make the most of each family's characteristics. Even with 4 players all players kept involved during other players' turns, because there are so many options you want to take, but you only get a few each round, so you must keep an eye on what your opponents are doing: "will this card that I also really really want still be available by the time the turn comes back to me?" Timing is also a crucial factor: only 5 rounds, and only 4 turns each round. So you must plan carefully when to pick your quest (because that determins player order and number of cards you can transfer to your Elysium, which is where they generate points) instead of a card, and when choosing cards you might want to keep an eye on what your opponents can do during your downtime. Clever mechanic with the colored columns. Can't wait to discover more of this gem!

After one play I'm unsure exactly what to think of Elysium. One player (who won) built a tableau of cards that interacted and gave her additional actions and bonuses for additional cards she bought. I took mostly cards that scored at the end and so each of my turns were 5 seconds and many of hers were upwards of a minute. 

There's also a lot of randomness in the order in which cards come up and indeed whether they come up at all so this falls into the tactical, play for fun category but I can easily see players with AP making this a misery for everyone.

I'm wary, but quite enjoyed my first play.

I love the game mechanics. The game should be longer though. The minute you have started your collection the game ends. Bummer!

interesting, slightly complex game

+ interesting mechanics (acquisition columns, transfer to elysium, ..., lots of different card mechanics)
+ interesting (tough) decisions
+ heightened replayability (only 5 of 8 card sets with very distinct gameplay per game)
+ Greek mythology theme, good artworks
- heavily card-based (sleeves necessary)
- odd associations with MTG-like card mechanics and Rummy-like set collection
- abstract, I dislike that cards work all the same no matter if they symbolize a human/creature/god or a concept/event
- a lot of the card abilities don't have much impact

There are some really good game mechanic ideas in this game, while I somehow dislike the Rummy-style set collection aspects.

A very cool game that blends several game mechanics well, but it suffers from analysis paralysis, especially with new players.  It's like a combination of Dominion and Splendor, with a touch of 7 Wonders and Star Realms.  It's a good game to have in your collection if you have a regular group of people to play with, because it will take a few games before you can appreciate it.

Not my style of game. It feels like a more complicated version of 7 Wonders in some ways. The drafting is on the table instead of in the hand, but otherwise you are trying to build sets while combining appropriate card powers for bigger bonuses. The pace of the game is too slow. The combo-building is only mildly interesting, especially when compared with other similar games. All in all, there's nothing really wrong with the game; I was just bored by it.

At its heart its a simple set collect/race game, but the way you get the cards and the way you score them is so unique and interesting. 3 player is a sweet spot. 2 player felt a little flat and I'd only play 4 player with people that have played before because the menu of options can feel a little too big. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Really good, but can be really stressful. There are a lot of things to consider on each turn: do I take that card for its ability, or that other card to add to a legend (collection), or that other card because it synergises with my other cards, or that other card to keep my opponent from getting it, or do I take a turn order tile now so that I won't go last in the next round. Then you have to decide which pillar to get rid of, which will limit what you can do on your next turn. Lots of tough decisions.

So far my only issue is that, at least during your first few plays, you have to take time at the start of each round to study each of the cards. up to 13 new cards will come out and they each have various things to consider (number, color, ability, and cost) and you really need to know what your options are so you have to spend time considering each thing. Not a huge issue, but it can really slow the game down.

Because of this, it seems like this would be a perfect 3 player game (I have only played with 2 and 4 so far). The 2 player game isn't good (there are too few cards over the course of the game), and the 4 player game can be just a bit long, so for me this seems like a perfect "best with 3" game.

Overall the game is fun and offers a lot of variety with the 8 different sets of god cards (you only use 5 sets each game).

[b]Player Count Verdict: 3-4[/b]
With two players there aren't as many cards in the game, so luck of the draw becomes a bigger issue. With more players, there is also more of a race to get the different bonus points and the rotating bonus tiles.

Very smooth card drafting game design.  The card actions are nothing super inventive or new but they work well.  The drafting mechanic works very well and creates a lot of thinking and deduction.  There is a good amount to think about here in a 45 minute play time.  Teaching the game takes roughly 15 minutes and by turn 2 everyone understands it.

Solid art work, great insert, good components across the board.

This is one of those games with a very low rules overhead, that plays briskly and can be taught quickly that I am increasingly drawn to.  The different card deck combinations add some variety too, almost as if an expansion was built in.

First Impression:
A very interesting card game.

Elysium has practically a single mechanic, simple drafting, boosted first from a great card variety and abilities, and second from a very novel player choice reduction mechanism (the pillars). It feels really fresh and works really well as a game. There is some downtime but it's the good one; you don't fight with the games mechanics, you just have hard choices to make at the drafting. There is a good amount both in tactical and strategic choices, and the replayability is also very very good, as in the best implemented card games. Thanks to the pillar mechanism, the interaction is also exemplary for a drafting game. The artwork and overall quality of the game is also pretty good. Finally, the lenght of the game feels good, and I was surprised a card game took so long to finish without feeling repetitive even at the slightest.

So what's not to like? Despite the best intentions, the game is thematically dead. There is some theme in the categories of the cards, a great attempt is made at the artwork and the player piecies but overall the game shows it's grinds, not any flavor. The novel pillar mechanism in particular - the one that makes the game feel fresh and shine in interaction - is completely arbitary and forced on the game.

Overall this is a card game that managed to feel fresh in it's mechanics, and really raised my interest. I cannot see this becoming a favorite - themeless game can never be with me - but I'd gladly play it again. If it is as replayable as it seems, I expect its rating to rise.

Elysium is a game that hadn't hit my radar until recently. But when it did, there were several things that made me take notice. First, it had an interesting card selection mechanic (and no I'm not saying mechanism). Second, I love Greek mythology and it's always an attractive theme to me. Third, I love card games where there's different card powers and players are trying to work out the best combination of cards. And lastly, the artwork in the game made it very appealing to me. So I was really intrigued by the game and decided to put in an order.

The game is a card game with a couple of neat things going on. There are 8 different types of cards, each tied to a particular god, but only 5 are used in any particular game. So depending on which types are selected, the game will play differently. Poseidon for example is a dick. If you're playing with him in the game then there will be attacky stuff that players can do to each other.

The game is all about getting cards in front of you, where they might have powers you can use, and then moving them into your Elysium where they'll score points... but they'll no longer have powers (except some of them might still).

Each round (there are five) there will be cards available to take, with only one extra card that won't be taken. Additionally, there will be quests to take, which are tied to turn order and some bonus stuff. Every player has to take 3 cards and 1 quest every round.


You have four columns colored red, blue, green and yellow. In order to take a card, you have to have the matching colored columns that are shown on the card... and then discard any of the four colored columns. In order to draft a quest, you have to do the same. So for your first selection, you might take a card that costs a red column, but discard your blue column. After which, you cannot take any card costing blue or the blue quest.

So you can screw yourself if you don't leave yourself the right colors. And other players can help screw you by taking something you wanted and leaving you nothing to do with the colors you have left. You must take 3 cards though. And if you can afford a card, you have to take one. If you can't afford one you take any card but turn it over showing the back... at which point it can be a wild card for you, but at a cost of -2VP at game end.

If you can't afford a quest, then you pass and after everyone else has taken one you take the worst quest and flip it facedown. Quests give you turn order, gold, victory points and the ability to move cards into your elysium... except on the facedown side you get screwed on most of that.

When you move cards into your elysium, you have to assign them to a set. You want either cards in a sequence (1, 2, 3) in the same color, or sets (2, 2, 2, 2, 2) in all five colors. And those sets score points at the end of the game depending on how well you managed to do do them. There's also a race to be the first to complete a sequence in a particular color or to have the most in a set of a particular number.

I really enjoyed this game a lot. I was pretty sure I was going to enjoy it, and it lived up to my expectations. The variety that the different decks offer will be interesting. I'm a little surprised that they suggest starting with Poseidon in play, as that leads to a very confrontational game with a lot of dickery. It was actually fun to play (note: I went after and played a great many of the Poseidon cards in this play) but may not be the best introduction to the game, especially for the people who get beat up on.

Also, not that this affects the gameplay, but the box design is rather clever. The insert is styled to represent a temple, with the slots for the different decks looking like columns in the temple, etc. It's a really nice touch on what could have been a simple boring insert. One of the players commented on how it was the "sexiest insert he had ever seen." (Note to self: don't leave Eric alone with this box.)

Clearly a well designed, well oiled game. Simple mechanics but rich and deep gameplay. Every small action you take has a lot of thinking behind and consequences for the following turns.

[+] components and artwork are great, mechanics are very simple yet offer many choices and dilemmas (which card to buy first, which pillar to discard, when to take turn order, keep card power active or move them to Elysium for scoring, go after series or families, gold or VP...); all that fits in a medium game (1h/1h30) with the base cards. Assume replayability is high with several extra decks and lots of combinations; there's some luck (available cards), but there are ways to mitigate it (citizens acting as wild...)
[-] theme does not shine, annoying setup/tear down (have to shuffle/sort all the cards); sometimes too many things to control

One play in under less-than-optimal conditions, but I'm tentatively on-board with what the game is trying to do.  The drafting and set-collecting are nothing you haven't seen before, but the mechanic which takes your useful cards and converts them to scoring is definitely fresh.  It's not easy to decide whether to keep a card for its use, or whether to put it into the scoring area because you only have a limited amount of chances to do so.  It's somewhat like the decision about whether to buy a scoring card or a utility/money card in [gameid=36218], but without the deck-building aspect. 

The basis of the game might be simple drafting, but there's so much extra stuff on there that it really manages to be quite difficult, to the point that it managed to spur an uncomfortable amount of analysis paralysis with my group.  I'm not sure all the bells-and-whistles are necessary, particularly the different colors of columns which serve mostly as artificial-feeling restrictions on what you're allowed to do.  Certainly I spent more time on trying to figure out which column I should give up than was really warranted.  It remains to be seen whether more play reveals this mechanic to be an unwieldy hassle, or an excellent source of tension.

UPDATE: After more than three plays, this is off the trade list and - inexplicably - into regular rotation. The small number of actions and decreasing number of options creates an immense tension and screwage. It well deserves it's KdJ nomination.

Gorgeous components and probably the best insert ever designed, but the gameplay was fiddly and excessively procedural. It simply wasn't fun.

The game involves drafting a small number of cards, and then getting them 'into your Elysium' (behind a player screen). 

To draft a card, you need to have the right pillars (red, yellow, green, blue). In addition, you need to complete a quest with a suitable coloured pillar. This creates a complex scheduling puzzle of picking cards in the right order, and paying with the right pillar.

I'm certain this would be fun for the right group.

'Elysium' is a game involving the promotion of various gods and demi-gods like Athena, Hermes and Zeus by acquiring 'legends' or groups of supporters spawned from the Oracle to create families.
Each of these supporters have a variety of abilities which they can activate whilst they remain outside of the aforementioned Elysium but only count as victory points once they are taken to this special place.
Players must balance the powers in play against the need to secure victory points at the end of the game as only a finite number of 'transfers' can take place each turn as a result of acquisition through coloured counters.
You must possess the appropriately coloured counters in order to lay claim to supporters or turn order tiles but you may place your bid by using a different colour so bear this in mind when deciding strategy.
There are a few high powered cards in use with certain gods, like Hermes, where you can score victory points for every four supporter cards left in the discard pile, quite a haul and one I missed out on!
A good game, nonetheless.

Vroenis Masters Award 1st runner-up tie.

I absolutely love this game. I love the dynamic of fairly wide opportunities in engine-building, but necessitating the destruction of those engines to score. It's a tight timeline, too, both within turns and throughout the full game, and gambits are immediate with stakes high. I suspect many players will be resistant to the instant tension the game creates from turn 1 - in that as soon as a player acts, they reveal something of their intent, and I [i]adore[/i] this. It makes feints and pivots difficult but not impossible, and those more deft at developing these skills will out-perform those still 2nd-guessing.

Does the theme shine through the dynamic? Probably not, but it's a great excuse for wonderful art, and I will suggest that many of the gods' behaviours are dynamic as far as their fictitious mythological characters go. One of the greatest learning experiences for me was that Hades wasn't about attacking other players per se, it was more about death and rebirth cycles in your own tableau, and that Poseidon is the biggest antagonist in the game, wreaking havoc on players his cards are utilised against.

I've not ever played this with 2 but I'd like to try it, with 3 it's good but as always, I prefer it with maximum players for maximum tension and interruption.

I suspect this will stay in my top 10 for a while.

The system of how you decide which of options are gone for the round is awesome. It's such a better way to limit what people can do than for example the dice in Castles of Burgundy.
The cards aren't that interesting though, some are clearly stronger, while some just aren't that interesting, and there even some pretty game-breaking combos. The game still feels great, I just wish there was something different about the cards. Also, even though you only play with 5/8 of the cards it doesn't feel that different.

[i]Preliminary rating after one 2p game:[/i]

Good, but I would pick Seasons over it as it offers deeper and more satisfying gaming experience (at least when played with only 2 players). There are some interesting decisions to be made here though, I'd gladly play it again with full player count.

I first learned this one at DTC 2016 and it easily became the number one game I learned that weekend.  I feel it is far better with four than with two, but even at two players I would rate it a 7.  There is a challenging management of resources that must happen in order to efficiently collect sets of cards... all of which grant different (really interesting) abilities.  The flavor on the cards are very thematic.

It's got a tableau-building feel similar to 7 Wonders, but I prefer Elysium: you actually DO something with the cards in your tableau, and there's more player interaction.
I also love the fact that you're constantly dismantling your tableau: it prevents it from getting too big and generating too much Analysis Paralysis...

As expected this game is rigth up my alley. I like the effects of the cards and the sphere-elysium-balance (what can I score already and what has to stay above?). I expected this game to stress me, but the turn-angst I heard about did not concern me. The mechanism with the pillars is neat, but not as punishing as I thought.

a very nice interesting original mechanic and then a lot of texts on a lot of cards and the usual stuff.
All in all not a bad game and replayabilty is good if you change gods decks.Unfortunately the complexity is given more by the sheer number of little tricks than by the depth of the game itself. Anyways, i could play it again

This one went back and forth for me: should I buy this or should I ignore it? In the end, I bought it and I’m happy I did. Elysium is a fast game and one full of difficult decisions and not nearly enough time to do everything you want. Combine that with a variable setup and I’m a happy camper.

The goal of the game is to have the most points at the end of five rounds. You do so by drafting cards from the Agora. You have four colored columns—red, green, blue, yellow—and when you draft a card you must have the columns represented on the card and then you must remove one of your columns, though not necessarily a column you used to draft the card. Each card has some benefit or disadvantage for your opponents. At the end of the round you’ll have an opportunity to move cards to your Elysium, where you’ll form sets based upon the suit and number at the top left of the card. You’ll be forming level legends which are all the same number, but different suits; and family legends which are all the same suit, but different numbers.

I can see how that description probably wouldn’t sell most people. It didn’t really sell me, but the promise of a game with tough decisions in under an hour hooked me, and it delivers. While the cards are typically thematic with the god they represent, I would never call this a thematic game, so understand that part is mostly window dressing. Still, it’s a great game and one worth trying and, maybe, buying.

Upstart demigod's in mythic Greece vying for a spot on Mount Olympus. Reviewers compare it to a Splendor-Augustus hybrid. Seed the game with card families of the Gods similar to deck builder setup. Use the four colored columns to recruit heroes, items, or powers from these cards (I would like to know what each color represents in the recruit cost?). Use these cards to build combos to amass gold and victory points as you transfer set collections to your Elysian Gardens representing the writing of your Legends.  The thrill is discovering and scheming to build your combo engine.

Nice ideas but to play optimally you need to process an awful lot of information on your turns which slows things down. There's also more take-that gameplay than I'd prefer in a game of this type.

This game is gorgeous, and I love the way you gain resources and select cards. The different sets of gods/factions make for interesting replayability options, as well.

Played this some more, and I love the tension between needing to have your cards in your Domain so that their abilities are active, and needing to move them to the Elysium where their abilities turn off, but you score them. The limited number of transfers adds to the tension. This is a great "Rochester" drafting game with a beautiful aesthetic.

It's so simple and so elegant and so much fun. Love how quick the game plays and how important every decision is.

The one and only drawback this game has is the end game scores. It's a mess and not even remotely intuitive. Going to have to make a score sheet.

UPDATE: Dropping the rating from an 8 to a 7 because of the lack of an expansion. Perhaps this is unfair, but an expansion is needed to fully unlock this game's potential. Still love it, but over time, this game will die.

Beautiful game with so many great looking components.  Love the mechanic pillar system in order to get cards.  It is very fresh and new.  I also enjoy that you play with many different God decks that are specialized in their own way.  Some are great for VP, some are great for interacting with other players, or obtaining gold, and so on.  This is just a wonderful game design and I love the tactical nature every round.

I enjoyed this one more than my wife did. She found it dry, was put off by the theme and didn't really grasp the point of the game. I enjoy the antiquity theme more and found the columns mechanism quite interesting but ultimately this game is muscled out by the slew of other great recently released titles.

Imagine 7 Wonders without the draft plus Dominion without the deck-building, mash them together with Greek gods and viola!... the diminishing ability to recruit cards, the push-your-luck for turn order benefits and the ability to use cards for their effects until you decide to turn the effect off and place the card in your scoring area are all awesome!

I may not be such a huge fan of drafting games, where drafting is the whole focus of the game. I do love drafting as a mechanism in a game. I am not a fan of games which have as wide an array of options right from the very start of the game as this one does. The options feels overwhelming. That said, the game is quite interesting, and not like any other game. The theme is interesting, even if I don't actually feel like a demigod playing it, nor immerse myself in the theme. It's one of those euros where it's completely quiet, and with all the options on a player's turn there's a bit of downtime as well.

RATING: 7.5
Elysium is a set collection game. If you think it's going to be about card combos and building an engine you will be disappointed. I make a point to explain this before playing with new players.

The card family sets could have been better designed. I would have liked a tighter controlled set of cards like in 7 Wonders. In a 2 or 3 player game too many cards are left in the deck. Certain abilities such as transfers should be in every family set but still tied to their central theme. (e.g. Ares: transfer 1 card for every 2 PP you have)

I'm finding it difficult to get this game to my table due to game length (60-90 min) and my regular playgroup being lukewarm on the game.

A lot of depth and variety in essentially a card game. Maybe a bit over-produced although I do like the clever use of the columns as the currency for the draft. The tiny text on the cards is a real shame. I don't think I'm fan of drafting and set collection in general, but this game mixes it up enough that I find it enjoyable.

At its heart this is just set collection.  Collect cards and try to make a straight flush or five of a kind.

But somehow it feels like far more.  The art is gorgeous (except for a couple of cartoonish Zeus cards.)  There's great tension involved in using your pillars correctly.  And I love how I have to rethink the game depending on which gods are available; it calls for a marked shift in strategy.

It plays in little over an hour yet I feel like I put 2 and a half into it.

Amazeballs.  I want to log a few more plays before I jump it to a full 10.

Nagyon szép tablóépítős játék, érdekes akcióválasztó mechanizmussal. Nem rossz összességében, de kicsit talán már feleslegesen van túlbonyolítva. A pontozás szinte követhetetlen - én "érzésből" játszottam, míg volt aki osztott-szorzott és mögöttem végzett, sőt, akit ketten gondoltunk az első helyek egyikére, az utolsó lett. Ettől függetlenül szeretnék majd még vele játszani, nem volt rossz az élmény.

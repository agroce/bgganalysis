Well, I suppose it will never be the "gamers'" auto-racing game. But it's a heck of a good time with family, friends, and casual gamers. 

Here's a recommendation a friend came up with to give player an added decision to boost or break their speed by a point or two per turn. 1. Add an averaging die to the game. This die will be added to _all_ throws except for the throws that take you through the opening phase of the game (where cars pass the 'L' or 'S' flag). 2. Before throwing the dice, the thrower declares "high", or "low." 3. Roll the dice and remove the lowest valued die if you declared "high"; or the highest valued die if you declared "low." 4. Move the number of pips shown on the remaining dice.

A nice dice rolling motor racing game where the whole race can change in seconds. 1 Play.

RATING: 6
Fun for a dice racing game. 6 laps seemed entirely too long to me. The way we played was with the variant where you have some dice modification cards. This seems pretty essential. The game would be way too conservative (read: even longer) without it. Amazing bits!

Got it yesterday, and played it once with a friend of mine. Its hard to NOT compare to Formula De, so I'll try not to here.  I think it would be a better game to play with a larger number of people- I can see this being a blast with 10  people.  That said, there are not as many decisions to make on a given turn as De, nor does the game really focus on corners and gearing.  Rather, this game is ALL about Pit Strategy and making your way through traffic.  Going to give it another shot on Friday night, and then write up my final take on the game.

RATING: 4.5
wash...rinse...repeat.  I'd do no more than 2 laps.  The spin-out rule doesnt' work at all if the last car in the pack spins out because they have to wait until EVERYONE goes all the way around the board. So we agreed that if the last car spins out, they just lose a full turn.  I don't like the player elimination here either mainly because there are cases where you have no choice but to roll dice in such a way that you can be eliminated (i.e. medium gray space, 9 mph speed limit, not blocked forces you to roll 2d6 where you will be eliminated if you roll 11 or 12.)

Analysis paralysis kills this too.  Play with fast players only.

A beautiful looking game.  Players run a team of two open-wheeler F1-like cars around track.  Twelve different tracks can be configured from three double-sided board sections.  Movement is conducted by rolling 1, 2 or 3 six sided dice (one is a special die that only rolls 1-3).  Cornering is handled by ingenious colour coding of track spaces, as well as imposing speed limits on some spaces that you depart from.  It doesn't take long for cars to be lapped, so "traffic" becomes an issue.  Very elegant rules for pitstops, damage, recording laps and so on.  Can be played at different levels - hurl the dice and move (and crash, use the red rear wing variant if you don't like this), or a game of calculated odds and team tactics.  Very similar to Formula De, but the scaled up size makes assessing your options a breeze (no peering at the board and counting spaces to the next corner).  Luck plays a factor, but there is some skill in this one.

I haven't played... but I did watch a group playing this for one hour of a 3 hour session. It looks like fun... but way too long for what it is (a common problem with racing games).  If you fall behind early (car crash), you have a long game session where you are almost guarenteed to lose to look forward too...

A dice fest, but a fun one.  The components are spectacular.  It accomodates larger groups very nicely.  Non gamers can get in to this.  And there is a fun press-your-luck element with some tactical decisions, that even gamers will enjoy.

RATING: 6.5
An enjoyable dice rolling game.  Very soon the leaders start catching up with the lap traffic, so there are few times when you don&#039;t have to deal with cars that are in front.  Just when you say &quot;Hmm, there is no way I&#039;ll ever roll higher than 12&quot; will be the time you get 13.  :)  Taking risks in this game can be very deadly.  If you need the speed, you&#039;ll just have to be prepared to suffer the consequences.

RATING: 4
This game has gorgeous pieces and high quality board to play on.  The problem is that I dislike racing games in general, especially when they have no real decision making to do.  This game has all of that, roll high and hope for a clear lane in front of you seems to be the rule of the game.  My game of three players took an hour and a half, which is too long for the entertainment available here.

Never really played the game -- I bought the game for the matching pairs of numbered formula one cars, great components for using with other much better F1 games, such as Grand Prix Circus.

RATING: 6
I really like this game...the components are top notch...rules are concise.  Our group has added a timer to the game to make decisions quickly.  the ability to use the die roll or the results on the opposite side of the roll really adds to the options and combine that with the timer option and you have a lightning fast option game!!!  you can get a coupel of expansion teams to add to the field so you can have 10 players racing!!!

My most recent play was a variant.  It worked pretty well.  We raced 4 short laps (take out the middle board).  We required 1 pit stop before the final lap or else the driver had to roll a standard d6 for the last lap.

We gave each driver a set of ten cards A - 10.  A driver could play a card instead of rolling the dice.  He could only hold three cards at a time, and the ten cards were randomly mixed before the start of the game.

This worked pretty well.  We felt it was an improvement.

ok.. I had to take this down a bit from 9 to 7.. it was fast to play with three people on a small track.. put six people into the mix, and if half of the "drivers"  take too many chances, you could have alot of people watching for the rest of the game.. Actually, it plays about the same length as Formula De.. both are fine games overall, but just not great.

This is a great game if you are a diehard race fan wanting to play a racing game with your more casual gaming friends. If you're looking for a driving simulation look elsewhere, but this game provides just enough balance between strategy and luck to be fun. While on the surface it may look like a dice-fest, there is a decent amount of strategy in this game, including risk-management, pit strategy, teamwork, and navigating lap traffic. This game is meant to be played with a full field of cars, and thanks to the brilliant peg and flag system on the absolutely gorgeous cars themselves, keeping track of a full 16 car field is easy, even for two players with 8 cars each. No cumbersome sheets of paper taking up extra space on your table! The races are always exciting: In the times I've played no one ever runs away with the lead, but a good player will know how to stay up front and be there for the finish, and no race has ever been run without a few crashes. It may not be a great analog for race driving, but perfectly captures the excitement and spectacle of motorsport.

Not nearly as good as the MOTORSPORTSPIEL. Motorchamp seems to be only die-rolling. I like the speed limit idea. I like the cars of course. But you only have to roll good and there is no other chance to stop you

RATING: N/A
After one play: what is this? Can someone explain where the fun is? If it were only 10 euros... desperately needs home rules!

Here are my home rules, a mix of motorchamp and formula 1:
- 1D6 for the gear record (1: 1d3; 2: 1d6; 3: 1d3+1d6; 4: 2d6;5: 2d6+1d3)
- 1D6 for motor record
- 2D6 for tires/brakes record
You can increase/decrease the gear one level or more using the motor D6 (1 for each gear change above 1)
According to gear you play the number of dice (1: 1d3; 2: 1d6; 3: 1d3+1d6; 4: 2d6;5: 2d6+1d3)
You can use the tires/brakes dice to decrease the result of the dices played in order to respect the speed limit indicated on the board
When you don't have enough tires/brakes to respect speed limit or avoid hitting a car, your car is out of the game
Played in one or two turns (we like one)
That's it. Great time playing until now! There are different strategies, and sometimes aggressive ones pay off... or not :-)

Risk management is the key of this tense and very exciting game. But beware, it MUST be played FAST ; otherwise, crash your cars and go away. Wonderful board and cars make it the most beautiful game I ever played.

Decent racing game with excellent parts... the best model cars in any game plus matching dice... rules are a bit basic with not enough decision making--mostly just roll and move... would benefit greatly from wear points or some other mechanism to allow emergency breaking and additional movement...

A great looking game, to have fun it is imperative that players keep things moving as quickly as possible.  Agonising about each move is pointless - there's just not enough depth to make it worthwhile

RATING: 3
In our game only 3 of the 8 cars finished, and most of the kills seemed to be from players rolling 12s.  The car that was at the back of the race from the start, due to an early spin when at the back of the pack, followed by an incredibly slow pit, finished third, despite being two laps behind the other two cars that finished.  Just seemed too luck dependent.  I like Turfmaster a lot so I'll stick to that or Formula De if I want a dice-based racing game.

I really like racing games...a lot.  I like trying out new games and seeing how they handle various aspects of movement to make the race actually interesting.  The system here is fairly robust.  I like the production of the cars.  I like the way the dice work.  I also like that the three double-sided boards allows you to create something like a dozen different tracks.  Even though I like this, people really need to play quickly as the game can drag if people dawdle too much.  [03/13/2011]

There is a lot of luck here, but I rather like how quick it is.  Really your choice every turn is how you want to play the odds of the dice.  Personally, I like the way that plays out, but it certainly isn't for everyone.  The bits are nice and all, but unfortunately they make this worthwile racing game price prohibitive for the amount of play that it will probably get.  If your looking for something as elegant as Turfmaster you aren't going to find it here, but really this is a lighter, quicker more accesable Formula De with less of the downtime.  Still, I think that 6 laps may be a little extreme as it runs about as long as it needs to by lap 4.  I'd be interested in playing this with the pit rules compressed so that you need to pit after turn two in a 4 lap race.

...but the cars are awesome.

I am a huge fan of Albrecht Nolte's Turfmaster and GolfProfi, so I wanted to love this as well.

It is fairly unique in that one races more than two or three laps (6 to be precise). It packs a lot of cars on a small track. The mechanics do work. And many contend that smart play wins out over the dice. That may be true, but the game is a bit dull. There are less interesting decisions than most race games and it plays about as long. 

I have tried cutting down laps and I think that helps some, I have tried the variant that uses cards I tead of die rolls, but it have mixed feelings about that too. 

I am keeping it for now because I am hoping it will be a fun kids game.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 5
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 1

RATING: 9
A stunning looking game.  Slightly more random than Formula De but also more tactical when running teams as more opportunities to hinder opponents.

Couple of house rules also make this more fun (e.g.  assigning a red "pit stop required" spoiler instead of crashing out)

My son is a huge F1 fan and this is his favourite racing game (over Form De, Detroit-Cleve GP, Wadds Formula 1, Speed Circuit, really nasty motor-racing)

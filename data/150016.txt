I guess solitaire games don't really do it for me.  I played it a lot the first week I downloaded the game and then have had no interest in playing it since.  A clever game, certainly better than more complex fare like Friday, but in the end its a solo game.

Javascript. First successful play-through: 2104 sheep at the end of Year 3, without yet implementing All-Purpose Sheep. 2200 a few games later. Then 2600 after a great start -- might've gotten to 4000 but my Flourish took forever to arrive in Year 3.
...oh hey! it got an iOS version in (or before?) October '16!

I can see the potential for fun as you slowly grow your sheep. However, getting a starting hand of bad cards where status quo is the best you can manage (and I'm pretty sure the possibility of hands where suicide is inevitable exist as well) and then you have to hope to draw some good cards isn't fun. If I want to play out a solo puzzle I've found Elevenses for One to be more fun.

Definitely struggled on my first 2 plays to understand how to mitigate all of the poor events and get some powerful cards to increase my flock size. I've only played this 3 times, but it plays in 15 minutes and makes for a good solo game. I'm very happy to have gotten this.

After 3 games found out I was playing the all-purpose sheep card completely wrong and was using it to play a bad card and removing that and the all-purpose sheep from my hand. Turns out the all-purpose sheep card should be to replicate a good card so you can keep that good card in your hand and play that card again later. Likely would have helped a lot of my scores.

Solid solo game!  
Shephy 是一隻有趣的單人遊戲，三回合內由一隻羊變一千隻羊，靠的是卡牌上的黃金組合- Golden Hooves/ Flourish 和 Planning Sheep/ All-purpose sheep，最後要有一點運氣便不難實現千羊帝國之路。
此遊戲在BGG網上亦有很多個變規，其中有兩三個非常有趣，例如 Epiphany變規便是把22隻牌全用，從而把一隻羊變七千隻羊。Triage 變規便是把Multiply, Fill the Earth, Dominion 和 Golden Hooves cards 從牌庫移走，把羊由一千隻變回一隻。
最後有一變規Rainbow; 現今還在苦思中, 便是把一隻羊最後變成1, 3, 10, 30, 100, 300, 1000 隻羊。喜歡單人遊戲的朋友不妨試試。

Quick-playing solitaire game, with whimsical artwork. There is not much meat on the bone here, and once you beat the game a couple of times (which you will for sure do, once you learn the short deck event) it becomes a once per year exercise. Nice but too shallow.

Blimus! Much harder than it first appears. The card play is simple enough once you grasp each meaning. You might as well run through the deck before playing, as one card allows you to pick from the draw deck. The cards basically improve or damage your holding, and that's really what you're managing. Getting over the threshold of the 100s is very tricky, after that reaching 1000 is simpler. For such a simple game, it's challenging, but maybe lacks long term depth. Still, very happy with my purchase.

Great little solo card game. You go through a deck of action cards 3 times and try to get as many sheep as possible. It is very simple to learn and plays very fast and smooth.

I absolutely love the art in the game. Some of the cards are hilarious. I'll pull this out often when I have 15 minutes to spare.

A very clever little solo hand-builder. The key is to not waste any plays ever and that revolves around the cloning card (I forgot the name) and saving it to eliminate big bads. Fun.

RATING: 7
2015 acquisition.

It's a charming and simple card game about sheep survival in a post-apocalyptic world.  You have to raise 1000 sheep before the evil black sheep do.

The mechanism is very simple.  You have a hand of 5 cards and you play a card each turn and replenish your hand at the end of it.  Each card played can either help or hinder you.  If you can get more than or equal to 1000 sheep after 3 rounds then you win the game.

The replay value is probably a little limited after a few plays when you've learnt all the cards.

Challenging solo puzzle/game as you wrestle with a card deck that adds and takes away sheep.  Gain at least 1000 sheep in your field and you win.  You can go through the deck three times.  After one play, I fared poorly so far not even making it a third of the way although I didn't know the cards then either.

Nice risk-reward puzzling with the combos and card shedding of a deck builder. The theme story and art are hilarious.

Setup and cleanup are fast. Play is streamlined, too, with one minor exception in the "Inspiration" card. These features are a plus in any game, but especially in solitaire. Compared to [boardgame=43570]Friday[/boardgame], Shephy is lighter and faster.

[microbadge=1714]

[u]30-Nov-2015[/u]:  Great, quirky art and a great, quirky theme unfortunately did not add up to a great, quirky game for me.  It's an okay game, but I think this may have suffered from too-high expectations from me.  The player needs to survive three rounds of play with at least one 1000-Sheep card in his field.  To do so, you manipulate the various cards through actions to increase the number of cards in the field as well as their values.

I found that just learning the deck over the course of 2-3 plays was more than enough to "win" the game.  However, this really isn't the true nature of the game, IMO.  It's really a high score game to see just how many sheep you can achieve by that third round.  I like high score games, but I wanted more than that from this game.

A one player card game about breeding post-apocalyptic sheep. Fantastic. It was a lot of fun, I lost, and the cards are drawn hilariously. The way this game works is you get a sheep, and a deck of action cards. Over the course of the game, you must play every action card in your deck, even the bad ones, and the goal is to get at least one 1,000 sheep card to the board before you go through your whole deck three times. The game is mostly about thread mitigation, for example, there is a card that says, 'return seven sheep' which would mean auto-death, so you have to save a card that says 'discard a card' or 'remove a card from the game' so that you don't have to play it. Anyway, I had a fun time with it even though I don't usually do one player games.

Quick playing solitaire game.  Will I go to it over and over?  No - that is why I can't rate this a 7 or higher.  But if in the mood for a quick solitaire game this one fits the bill nicely.

Deck has good and bad cards, so via the neat twist of having to play ALL the cards each round by playing out your hand when the draw deck is empty forces the game to be one of balancing the gains and losses in such a way to hopefully net gain over each round towards the desired 1000.  

After a few plays, the combinations can be seen that drive the pacing to the goal.  Did manage a win on the fifth game played.

(Bouken published edition which is nicely packaged unless one sleeve's the cards - then no room in the box.)

Wonderfully charming, if a little light and having now completed it twice, I'm not sure there's much to make me need to play it again and again.

It is almost impossible though not to be won over by the artwork.

Update: Oddly, this remains charming and an easy option to fill five minutes (though that often escalates as I play multiple games back to back). I've also now seen an unwinnable opening hand, but even that rare let down hasn't diminished the appeal of the game.

Rating up from 6.9 to 7.3.

Not one for solitaire games, I found Shephy to be a fun little solo romp. Though I bet once all the cards become known and memorized, the game will cease being fun and turn into an exercise of optimization. Still, this game is pretty well designed, cute and a light-hearted solo filler for the bored and lonely.

RATING: 6
This is a cute and clever card game that presents a nice challenge for 15 minutes.  Your goal is to get up to having at least 1000 sheep in your field, and you start with a lowly one sheep.  You have a deck of event cards that are good and bad, and you have to go through the entire deck to make it through a full round.  Get up to at least 1000 sheep by the third round, and you win!

The game breaks down into being more a puzzle than a game, but it will take a few games to figure out the best combination of cards to maximize your turns.  I find that the All-Purpose Sheep combined with the "Remove one event card from the game" or the "Combine and upgrade your sheep" card is the best tactic to use.  Once you get that going, it's easy to bulk up your sheep, but I do wonder if the game will have a lot of replay value because of that.  So far, my high score is [b]910[/b].

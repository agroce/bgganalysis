Just a nightmare. You have to draw, look at other's drawings, flip through a deck of 7 cards while drawing to throw cards at other players, grab random tokens, etc. Way overly complex and fiddly for a "fun" drawing/party game. I'd rather play Pictionary any day.

Great party game. I just don't see myself wanting to play this all the time. This is where the BGG ratings scale doesn't help as it is probably a 7 or higher with the right group.

RATING: 5
1st play: When I first heard about this game I passed on picking it up because I think Vlaada designs great games, but not great party games.  I feel like his designs are always interesting, but not quite streamlined enough for big groups of people to sit down and play a game.  After Codenames I decided to give a second look to this.  Turns out, I was right.  The game is interesting, and amounts to "Draw well, Guess well", and is simultaneous and frantic.  But the scoring is just a tad wonky, and there's a decent amount of downtime between rounds.  The game works, it's just not smooth.

2nd play: Second play with non-gamers and as expected, the scoring is a bit too complicated to work and be smooth.  Mostly the game turns into rounds of drawing followed by guessing.  Close but not quite there.

Not usually a huge fan of "speed" games, but this one is fun!  A really neat take on pictionary, and while I am not very good at this game, I did have good fun. Some of the topics yo have to draw can be very tough!  A party game that I do hope to play much more of.

A really fun to play party game. You don't have to draw very well to be able to play. In fact if you draw ugly it's more fun ;). The idea of drawing something from the card where each word is very similar is brilliant and it is even more brilliant on higher difficulty cards where the words are more abstract. Scoring is also clever and the fact that everyone draws and guesses at the same time makes this game one of my favourites.

Ridiculously good time.  Everybody was so energetic about the game.  We've had a great time with Telestrations in the past, so this is a different idea altogether with some sense of strategy thrown in.

The components got beat up almost instantly, more so than almost any other game.  Maybe poker chips would have been better than cards.

RATING: 7
A great Pictionary-style game where all players are simultaneously all drawing AND guessing everyone else's drawings.

The game is also very clever in that you know all possible words that other players are potentially drawing, but the words are often similar to each other, such as lock, key, keyhole, padlock, etc.  The earlier you guess someone's drawing, the more points you'll get, but the better chance you'll screw it up if they're not finished drawing yet since some words are so similar.

Overall, a great, frantic drawing/guessing game!

This is definitely a very gamey party game. Which is great for people who find party games too simplistic, but I think I would prefer to play a simple game of pictionary over this. For me, there is something excessively hectic about this game. I just don't need my party games to ask me to think amongst multiple vectors at the same time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It took me a bit to figure out why this is called "Pictionary for gamers" but I think I understand. This game compared to other party games like Telestrations, etc., has a very structured (and somewhat fiddly) scoring system with very definite winners and losers, which lends itself to... I feel like saying "strategy" is misleading, but there is some extra "game" factor here missing in similar games.

The result, though, is a drawing game that feels more competitive than your average party game. If a lack of competitive spirit is the key behind your usual distaste for party games, Pictomania will almost certainly satisfy.

As for me, I feel like this is missing some kind of crucial laughter component. There's confused laughter here and there, sporadically, but because everyone is working at their own speed it is not necessarily a shared laughter. Sometimes at the end if a player draws something especially poorly you might get someone else calling it out between rounds so everyone can share a laugh, but this game actually made me appreciate the more focused scoring of other drawing games where everyone takes a minute to direct their attention to one particular drawing, and share in its hilarious treasures.

It's not just that, though. Like Pictionary, this game is only truly funny when someone can't draw. The game succeeds hugely in pushing even the most skilled artists to struggle with its demanding purple cards, but more often than not the result is a feeling of challenge (for the artist - and let's be clear I think this is a good thing!) and confusion (guessers) than [i]comedy[/i]. I find games that ask players to draw really bizarre situations (Who? What? Where? or Eat Poop, You Cat! / Telestrations) or games that result in just these really weird art pieces (Tadaaam! or A Fake Artist Goes to New York, which also has a tense and funny social game layered ontop) to just be plain funnier, and thus, more appealing.

I would happily play this with people that like it, no questions asked. I may even want to play it myself from time to time for the unique challenge it presents, but I don't think I would call this a "must-have" drawing game. The purple cards really make it shine and only really work IN this game... I just wish Pictomania gave me more reason to laugh.

RATING: 6
This is an attempt to transform a drawing game (i.e. Pictionary) to a strategy game. Personally I don’t think the mix is succesful, but overall the game is okay and I would play it from time to time, but it’s definitely not one of my favorite party games.
Even though you cannot draw, you can still win; and, truth be told, it seems as it’s a better strategy to draw a little bit, then guess the other players’ drawings, and then draw a little more on your own picture. Of course, if everybody does that, the game can drag, and it defies the purpose of the game – but that is what can happen when you add points to what is otherwise a social game (and the reason why I never play Telestrations with points). 

Of course, you must still be somewhat capable of drawing something, because if you can’t, you will get a lot of minus points because people won’t guess you drawings. Speaking of the drawings, some of the words you need to draw are almost impossible… How do you draw “there”, ”novel” (when the other words are for instance short story / fairytale etc., mind you!), suburb etc. With those words, the fun comes from people gasping and staring at the words, but I personally think the more accessible words are more fun as it’s actually possible to draw and guess.

My kids love drawing games, so this one immediately caught our interest.  We all enjoyed our first play, but I wouldn't say this one stands above or below any of the others we like.  Nice that it can be played with 3-6 players for the times we don't have enough people for Telestrations.  Scoring feels a little bit wonky - sometimes it's difficult to decide who put in the first guess for any individual player because there are a lot of moving parts with everyone drawing and guessing simultaneously.

Simultaneous drawing + guessing what others are drawing, with incentives for both speed and accuracy, put together in a way which works even for people who can't draw especially well.

This is a good family or party game that can play 6.  Everybody sees the same set of 6 cards, where each card is a category of 7 items to draw.  Everybody draws their item simultaneously while each person tries to guess what everybody else is drawing.  The faster you guess, the more points you get, but guessing incorrectly can result in negative points.  You also get negative points when others do not guess your picture correctly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I was nicely surprised by this one.  The scoring system is simple and rewards both good drawing and good guessing.  I like how the cards are set up to make it quite challenging for people to guess, forcing you to draw well so that others guess yours so that you can get rid of your stars.  

The piece that really surprised me, though, was the element of deduction present in the guessing.  You get 7 number cards, and one is yours, so that's out.  Then, after making (what you think are) successful guesses on other drawings, it you have a smaller set of options to make guesses on the difficult drawings.  That can really help narrow things down... or reveal just how badly you've messed up your guesses.

As a party game it also leads to some hilarious moments - "what the hell are you drawing?" "you don't know what a pecan looks like?" - as well as funny situations where someone gets the right number but for the wrong reason.  Didn't think that would happen, but it does.

It also doesn't hurt that I was like Rain Man in my first two games.

WHAT?!

How has this not been released in the US? Why! I would chop off a finger or several toes to get a copy of this game. Seriously.

This game is amazing. You don't have to be a good artist to win. There's no down-time. Everyone is both drawing and guessing at the same time, so you must balance your time on your own work with examining the others. Each player is secretly assigned a card to draw from and a numbered item on that card's list. Having the lists to examine prevents guessing being inane like pictionary.

It took me some time to get Pictomania to the table and now I wonder why. I guess, it was the scoring that made the game sound more difficult than it really is. But after playing a learning round, the scoring was clear to everyone and we could start to have fun. And this game is really a lot of fun. The combination of simultaneous guessing and drawing works great. Hope I can introduce this to a lot of people.

While the game is a direct descendant of Objet Trouves, and thus not entirely original, that is not a bad thing in this case.  Trying to distinguish between a list of things that are related and not necessarily easy to distinguish is quite a fun activity.  In this game, the harder the category, the more fun the game is.  I'm not convinced the drawing and racing to vote is all that fun, but since points don't matter it's no big deal.

Pictomania is good but perhaps a little too gamey for the family.  The clever way that it is scored is perhaps just a bit too clever.  The rest of the family never really got the scoring system.  But the idea that everyone is always drawing is great and completely addresses the downtime issue of Pictionary.

The best drawing game. Since every answer is listed on a card and each number can only be used once, you can actually use deduction to help you figure out any drawings that are particularly confusing. Also, makes it nice that you can go over all the possible answers at the beginning to make sure that there aren't any that people just don't know. Great, great game. Let's hope it gets a US distributor soon to spread the fun!

Galaxy trucker meets pictomania, Vlaada does it again.

The extra tension of drawing while having to guess your opponents drawing really makes this game. It's not just drawing or guessing, it's both. Drawing skills not required, you can definitely win while drawing stick figures

after many plays, this game always delivers. You really want 5-6 players so that the 3 star chips are in play. This is my go to game for party games at 5-6 size, always produces tons of laughs and fun.

Components: really good ones

Weight: family/ party
Players: as much as possible
Length: probably too long for what is worth
Mechanics: draw pictures, guess things
Decisions: not many
Opinion: funny game in the beginning, could get boring in the end.
Here we have several cards with several options on each, you get your coordinates and have to draw something, once you finish you have to guess what others have done, and all of this is done in real time.
I had some laughs the first rounds, but the games lasted too much for me. First of all you have so many words to take into account, this means that all those cards must be visible to all players, and playing with 6 is hard to do. Then you have to guess what the rest are drawing, therefore you need to see the cards again, and put your tiles with the appropriate number, also in real time.
Lets say that is good that others guess what you have drawn, as you get points for that, and is good that you guess what others have done, as you get points for that... the experience has turned to be... draw fast something a bit legible, and run to put your tokens... in case is hard to guess.. you can do randomly...and you can win with that, yes, it's hard, but is possible.
First rounds laughs were very high, last rounds faces were not so happy

Absolutely brilliant party game for gamers. Best at high player counts (I wouldn't even bother with 3). Whether a casual player enjoys it will depend more on whether they can handle the rules (they mesh intuitively, in a very Vlaada way, but there are a lot more of them than in Pictionary) than on whether they can draw (barely matters).

Great fun (especially on the harder difficulty levels, where the game really shines), but a couple things keep it in the realm of a niche "party" game. Namely, the limit of 6 players (which means it only works for a small "party") and the fact you can actually score quite poorly if you don't play well - make sure your fellow partygoers won't be disappointed by lopsided scores.

RATING: 5
Pictomania is a brandnew drawing and guessing party game. Unlike other drawing games, drawing and guessing are processed at the same time in Pictomania. The game idea is refreshing and brilliant. However, this game has a certain shortage for this reason. Only few players can participate the game. Moreover, this game also gives somewhat confusing feelings to game participants. To be honest, I prefer Telestrations instead of this.

Really nice party game.  Fun :)

I would've bought it if I had had regular group/opportunities for playing it.
I can surely play if someone suggests it.

Warning: language dependence might spoil some fun.  Maybe it's best to prepare cards with words to be guessed in your own language.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Entertaining game of frantic drawing and guessing drawings. The main negative is just that if I want something to replace pictionary I'd rather play telestrations. Now to be fair that game does have a bit of a different tone to this one. In that game it's mostly about laughing at what happened and it's best with poor drawers where in this one you sometimes have to be a little clever in how to draw your thing since there are by design a bunch of similar things you could be drawing. But I felt too often that they were neither quite similar enough to each other nor abstract enough to really make you have to think about your drawing. And as a result the game came down to a speed game. I've only played with level 2 cards though, so I could see this going up with the higher level cards.

Update: played with the level 4 cards, and it went up from a 7.5 to an 8, they really make you think about what you're drawing and thus make the game much more interesting. It still hurts when you get to every spot half a second after everyone else and you get penalized a bunch of points for it. But otherwise an excellent party game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Pictomania is far from a perfect party game, but it is too fascinating to ignore. It has some excess complexity (especially from a scoring system that is both well-designed and not completely intuitive), but its chaotic gameplay is an experience worth the price of admission. The act of drawing and guessing simultaneously is quite the challenge, forcing players to quickly alternate between using creativity and using analysis and deduction. It's a unique concept that will be enthralling for some and off-putting for others, but Pictomania's insane genius is at least worth giving it a try.

Draw pictures while trying to guess what pictures other players are drawing.  Get points for guessing correctly, and lose points for those who don't guess your drawing.  It's not my thing.  Plus, the cards are a bit unbalanced, so you can get stuck with something impossibly hard while somebody else gets something laughably easy.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (May 2015)

Vlaada Chvátil is one of my favorite game designers, so I was keen on trying Pictomania, and the game is a blast. It is THE drawing game, miles better than Telestrations (which I really dislike).

The game has easy rules and it plays very fast. Each turn you have to draw as quick as possible while at the same time trying to identify what your friends are drawing. It is fun chaos. I can’t draw to save my life, but still I had fun playing it.

I LOVE that the scoring structure is well defined, I don’t mind losing but I don’t enjoy games in which a winner cannot be decided or it is arbitrarily done.

I don´t get the dragon in the game cover.

Bottom line, I really enjoy Pictomania. It has the potential of going even further in my personal ratings. I’m rating it a 6.5 because I really don’t like drawing games, but this shows what a good game it really is. It managed to exceed my dislike for the genre. I will keep it in my game collection. A drawing game that really works. My GF really loved the game.

Current Rating: 6.5

After more plays, I continue to enjoy the game, but I no longer feel Pictomania will scale further in my personal ratings. However it has a permanent spot in my game collection, it is the only drawing game I will keep. My GF request it often.

Some of the cards are very hard for me to draw. The words in the hardest difficulty (purple cads) are insanely hard to draw, but we all have fun playing it. 

Funny enough, I have won most of my Pictomania plays and I’m the worst illustrator I have ever known.

RATING: 7
Pictomania is a neat idea for a game. It truly is Pictionary for gamers. My biggest gripe, and it's really silly, but for me, it seems to hinder players who actually are good, or at least decent, at drawing. Players who doodle something in 5 seconds and start making their guesses are handsomely rewarded (as long as at least one player guesses correctly on their picture) while players who take a few extra seconds to make their drawing somewhat legible are at a disadvantage. Like I said, that's a silly thing, but for me, it's enough to take it down a bit.

There's theoretically an entertaining game in there, but it depends a lot on with whom you're playing. No control on whether people actually draw anything or not may suck big time.

Nice family game or filler. The topics get harder to draw and the risk that no one finds out what the drawings are increases. Nice little game. Easily the best game that includes drawing I've ever played. It is essential to pay attention to others, to determine what players are doing, and draw with a decent enough quality so that other players can determine what you drew.

I can't imagine a game being more fun than this one. And its so clever and tightly designed I still wonder how it can feel so accessible. 
With three skilled players Pictomania is the most competitive and fast paced drawing game that you can think of. 
If you just add one more player the flow of the game can change dramatically in favor of a slower pace and drawing and guessing being more prominently featured.

Playing it on the most difficult level got the most laughs. The problem I think with this game is that is a drawing game which immediately lends itself to being a party game. However, the rules are cleverly designed in a way to make it very competitive. This game should not be played when in the mood for Telestrations, Telestrations is for when you could care less about the score. Pictomania is all about the scoring.

Recently had the experience of playing this shortly before playing Pictionary. Pictomania is of course better, but it's a little too subtle and rulesy for a party game (and only goes to six players!)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Pictomania is a party game in which you're drawing pictures and trying to guess what others are drawing.  What makes this game stand out is that here you're trying to do both of those things at the same time.  Players are dealt cards with a symbol and a number, which indicates which picture on a grid of words they need to draw.  Players play their guess cards face-down in front of opponents to guess their pictures (based on the column)--the earlier correct guesses will score more points.  You also score points for having players correctly guess your picture.  So it's a delicate balance of spending time drawing a guessable picture, and paying attention to others' pictures to guess them early.  As I enjoy drawing games, I enjoyed this, but the artist in me wishes I could spend more time making pretty pictures.

Brilliant, chaotic tension between wanting to draw fast so that you can guess at others' drawings quickly, but wanting to draw accurately (slower) so that others will guess yours correctly. Add to that the twist of having to guess from a list of similar items. Without having played them all, I declare this the best drawing game.

Frantic Pictionary. Party style where everyone is drawing and simultaneously guessing. It's light and fun, definitely more chaotic than Telestrations.
-Point scoring can be a little fiddly, but as long as someone is familiar enough to moderate, it's not a bit deal. Plays better with each additional player.

In the first round of this game, we used the basic deck of cards, and people were pretty much done with the game after that. Everyone except the player who brought it hated the time pressure of needing to both draw, look at the cards with the possible word choices and then guess at in the same phase. For the second round, we whipped out the highest level of difficult cards. That's when the game changed from frustrating to fun. The high level cards are all either abstract concepts, or they are super similar to other words. For example one card had the drawing prompts "liquid" "water" and "fluid" or something like that. The player drawing gets assigned one of these, and wants people to make the right guess based on his drawing. Very interesting. I would play this again, but only using the high level cards.

A gamer's version of Pictionary, which, since it replaces that "classic," (which I loathe) I'm happy to own it.  It isn't particularly difficult or involved (much to my surprise, being made by Vlaada...whose games can run from "intricate" to "impenetrable"), but it is a fun, mass-market bound board game.  I could imagine it getting picked up by Target very, very easily. Is that a bad thing?  No.  Is it the next Mage Knight?  Nope.  
Bottom line: it's a cool little family game.  
Side note: GREAT insert.  Seriously.  Everything has its place.

A bit messy with all this drawing and wiping (I recommend a whiteboard eraser fluid and lots of paper towels on your table), but it is a very enjoyable game! You need to play it couple of times to get the general idea and understand what to do and what to avoid. Don't draw too much, don't draw very little, guess quickly, guess often, draw some more, grab these bonus tokens quickly, you don't have to guess everything. 

Lots of fun, lots of laugh, replayability, great classic that should work for pretty much everyone. You don't have to know how to draw pretty, you just have to draw "clearly" and get those ideas how to present the word in a most concise way.

RATING: 7.5
This one needs to be played with the perfect group. Players tend to disagree on what is more important- racing to finish first, racing to guess first, or drawing a coherent picture so other players can guess correctly. The truth is, all of these things are very important, and aiming for just one tends turn the whole thing towards chaos. Hopefully this is one that gets better as players become more experienced with these wacky goals.

Fun dexterity party game from the designer of Through the Ages. Points are won by drawing pictures enabling the others to guess your word or phrase (often abstract), and also by guessing others' efforts. I did ok on the second part, but abysmally on the first, due to complete lack of talent, though that probably increases the fun factor for others.

House Rule to play with (one) very young kid (Little One)...
- Somebody (third person) chooses suitable word from all available and discards appropriate number/type cards
- Little One does not get voting cards, but gets regular point tokens
- Other players only get point tokens corresponding to 'regular' (non young kid) players, also 'finish-round-point' tokens are selected this way (not counting Little One)
- Little One only draws the picture which he is told by Third Person
- After finishing his drawing, Little One cannot take 'finish-round-point' tokens
- Other players assign their voting cards to all players (including Little One)
- After round is finished (all finish tokens are taken), first...Little One is trying to guess what other players were drawing awarding him 1 point for each correct guess (free way, no seriously)
- Little One does NOT get any penalty or minus points for unassigned tokens 
- Other players gets their points regulary (including points for correct guesing of Little One drawing)

A neat idea, but a bit too gamery for a party game. 

6 cards, each with 7 items of a type, are on display. Players are randomly/secretly assigned to one of those items. They simultaneously draw their item and make guesses (using cards numbered 1-7) about other players' drawings. When you're done guessing/drawing, take a bonus chit from the center (there are n-1 chits available). 

Then players reveal the answer and others' guesses; give VP chit if correct (higher value for earlier guesses; each player has n-1 chits). Whoever had the most incorrect guesses, if they took a bonus chit, deduct the value of that chit. Also, deduct values of all the scoring chits they didn't reward to other players.
----

When we played, people were intentionally making incomplete drawings so that others wouldn't guess too early -- so that the slow-drawer would have more time to guess about other people! That should NOT be a viable option in a party game! Otherwise, this could be an interesting game. Definitely worth another play, if only with a different group of people!

RATING: 6
Vlaada Chvatil is one of my top 3 favorite designers.  He is not known for his party games and this is certainly the kind of party game he could be expected to design if he were to.  This has been called a "gamer's" party game for how it combines pictionary with some more "gamery" rules for depth and a more engaging experience.

In this game there will be 6 cards on the table with 7 clues on each card.  Each card has a theme, for example parts of a face; nose, ear, mouth, etc.  Then each player will receive two cards, one corresponding to one of the clue cards and another corresponding to a number on that card.  This is the thing they need to draw.  Once all the players have the thing they need to draw they begin simultaneously drawing and trying to guess what other players are drawing (in theory).

The reason I say "in theory" is because I have yet to see the game played any other way than each player quickly draws their clue then begins trying to guess other players.  This takes a little bit of the "gaminess" (man I am just creating a ton of new words in these comments) out of it as it is to be expected that players will take different strategies to vary games a bit.  When players guess what other players are drawing though they only place a number, not a symbol dictating which card they are drawing from.  This could, also in theory, mix things up a little bit since you could correctly guess the right number even if you had the wrong card in mind but it would, in reality, be hard to mix up a drawing of a part of the face with a drawing of a sea animal for example.

The scoring is a bit wonky, each player gets points for correct guesses, the first player getting more points than the others.  Each player also can grab points from the center of the table when they are finished drawing and guessing (although if they get the most wrong guesses these are worth negative points).  You also lose points for each one of your own scoring tokens you don't get rid of.  I see the logic behind these scoring rules.  If you finish quickly and grab one of the higher point tokens from the center but guessed poorly you are penalized to discourage grabbing it early for free points.  Also, you are penalized for not drawing a picture other players could easily guess to discourage you from drawing incorrect things to cause other players to lose or not get points.

I think this opens the game up a bit to exactly what the game is almost designed for, gaming the system.  A player in one of our games commented that most party games you play for fun though, not necessarily to win.  But this game was clearly designed to be a party game for "gamers" and gamers like to win.  Players could certainly band together and refuse to place guesses on a player in the lead to cause him to lose points under this rule set.  I also don't care for the rule that there are one fewer tokens in the center than number of players so whoever takes the last one immediately ends the round for the last player.  This could also be used to game the system.  If you are one of the last two players guessing/drawing, it almost behooves you to immediately take the final token.  You may be robbing yourself of points as well but you are also in danger of the other player doing the same to you so you can play chicken or at least get an extra point out of the deal and potentially really ruin another player's chances to score points that round.

I think the simplest solution for gaming the system to screw over point leaders would be to have hidden scores.  The way the game and components are designed you write your point total right on your drawing board for all to see.  With hidden points this would discourage gaming the system to simply ruin another players experience because it would be difficult to determine the point leader, especially with higher player counts.  As for the immediate turn ending rule I almost wish the game had a mechanism like in Robo Rally or Galaxy Trucker (another Chvatil game) where the first player to finish or the second to last player to finish starts a timer for the remaining player(s).  The last player is already not scoring any "speed points", why also rob them of being able to finish the round?  I don't like "kick them while they're down" rules in most games.

The game almost seems unpolished, which is very odd for Chvatil who has had some of the most brilliantly balanced and deeply designed games I've ever played.  The ideas are very clever and I actually had a good time.  The groups I've played this game with didn't really attempt to game the system and that made it better but knowing the kind of gamer I am and the kind of game this is meant to be I couldn't blame them if I had.  I would blame the game.

This was a load of fun. I like the tension of everyone playing at once, trying to both draw well enough to get lots of guesses, and to guess others' drawings (with a bonus for being early in guessing correctly). 

Other drawing games always seem to have one person or team really engaged and the others sitting and waiting. This is non-stop. 

The only flaw of this game, which for me keeps it from being a 10, is that since you vote with a number card only, not the full identifcation (a number and a symbol), you may get lucky as I once did and get rewarded even though you are incorrect. This is rare, but it can happen. For example, both the words "noun" and "that" were in the number 7 spot on their cards. One person drew a bunch of objects with arrows pointing to them, so I thought she meant "that" when it was really the word "noun." But since I gave her a 7 card, I got points.
I can see how any fix to require the symbol card in the vote would slow things down but it still bothers me as a "bug." 

Still, very fun game.

A more fun, if more frustrating, version of Pictionary. It does improve it, but not by a million miles.

This game suffers as we played Time's Up right after this which was infinitely more fun and had a lot more laughs.

Update: This is a consistently great game, with not being able to draw not quite the penalty you'd perhaps expect it to be.

I'd rate it higher for the amount of fun it is, but the lack of purple cards restricts the replayability and so the rating.

A great Euro-take on Pictionary.  Players draw different things at the same time while trying to guess what the other players are drawing.  A simple bonus point mechanic allows for some scrambles in the middle of the table leading to many laughs.

Excellent twist on the basic Pictionary concept of drawing clues as quickly as possible.

Transforming the game into one of multiple choice is a stroke of genius because it alleviates the number one complaint I hear about Pictionary, namely that "I can't draw." Hidden in that objection is a secret sense of shame, that the complainer doesn't like being put on the spot or letting his team down when the scribbles he makes on the paper fail to connect. In Pictomania, that fear is much alleviated. Instead of one person drawing while the others look on in judgement, everyone draws at the same time! What's more, you'll want to get something down on paper as quickly as possible so that you have enough time to guess what everyone else is drawing from a list of possible clues. Draw and guess to slowly and you miss out on important bonus points. The reason this works so well is that it ensures that everyone draws too quickly, and therefore poorly. The game goes from being one person's worst nightmare ("Why is everyone staring at me?!") to a raucous race where everyone feels equally pressured, and therefore able to laugh along at the successes and failures of the group.

None of this is to say that the game levels the playing field (and therefore neuters the game). Skillful drawers and guessers will still win more times then not. However, the game certainly "feels" more fun, more equal. It's a neat trick, and well worth the adventure.

Vlaada is my favorite designer, and I have yet to play a game of his I didn't like.  But it's just drawing, right?  How much design space is there?

Another solid performance for Vlaada.  Pictomania provides everything I would want in streamlined a drawing game.  The best part are the cards that list the possibilities for each person to draw.  They each have a theme, and the objects in the theme can be very similar (i.e. hamster vs ferret vs mouse).  This feels like a gamer's drawing game, similar to how [thing=178900][/thing] feels like a gamer's taboo.  The only problem is that I already own [thing=46213][/thing] and I mostly play that with non-gamers that might not like Pictomania as much.

While another drawing game might be the funniest you'll ever play, Pictomania is the smartest.  Layered on top of the drawing aspect are several competing strategies based on simultaneously guessing the other players' drawings.  There is a lot of recordkeeping but it's necessary to make the whole thing work, and it works great.

Pictomania is a riot. Vlaada has built an intelligent, tense, scrappy game around a basic premise that every gamer and non-gamer already understands - Pictonary!

This is a fantastic example of clean game design. A minimal number of moving parts are used (and reused) to determine the word you must draw, ensure you put forth a good-faith effort in your drawing, reward those who draw their clue well, create a risk/reward of guessing other's drawings too early, and creates an intuitive scoring system.

There's also an element of deduction built in that savvy gamers can use to their advantage, provided they've made smart decisions earlier in the round!

I envision Pictomania being a party game staple for years to come.

RATING: 7
Pictomania is a party game where you simultaneously draw a picture and guess what other players have drawn. You play a card, which matches the number of the item the person drew, on top of their pile to make a guess on what they're item is. At the end of the round, if you guess someone else's item correctly you take one of their "star token" from them. The first person gets a 3 star token, then 2, and so on. If you have someone else's tokens they count towards your score. If you still have yours they count against your score. And there's a race to finish first, as there are communal tokens that you can take when you finish.

The game is a good party game and a lot of fun. You don't have to be a good artist to play, as guessing what other's have drawn is at least as important as your own drawing ability. Judging when to bow out of a round and steal a high race bonus can be tricky.

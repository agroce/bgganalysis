Very well written, lots of work went into this and considering the voluminous material, I detected no typos so the proofreaders were spot on.  The story was good, tense at times and much more immersive than the typical "Choose your own adventure" books that the game is compared to.  

My complaints
(1) It moved along slowly at times.  To some, that might be a positive because it made the story seem more real, not adventure after adventure. But I found those parts a little boring.  

(2) This one is tough to articulate.  The game seemed a little over the top regarding 2017 themes.  There is a lesbian marriage and a transgender character.  Not sure that is necessary in a fantasy setting, but then again, those are prominent issues currently.  However, I felt this was a little too overt for my tastes.  As a result, I am hesitant to pass the game on to my brother and his 5th grade daughter who were looking forward to borrowing the game when I finished.  

Nonetheless, the game is a positive experience and I think worth the $45 to pick it up.  You probably could replay it a couple of times with different characters to try and see everything, but the replayability is not a selling point here.

The experience and game engine is wonderful. But there is one mis-step I would call out here. This box would have been better served by have 20+ pre-made characters that people could select from and run through the game with. Possibly refining the talents and stamina around. The main problem is my group did a great job developing unique backgrounds and characters, but it feels like we are coloring outside the lines. The options we would take in a full RPG just aren't being presented in the story. While 80% of the time it is working fine, and the story is good and driving along at a good pace, the other 20% of the time we are talking over the reader of the story, stating that we are doing this or that instead. Now this probably means that my group is ready to move onto a full RPG instead, but this product just isn't a perfect fit. 

That said for those who don't have experience with an RPG this product is a great way to play a game "on rails" just a little bit. But that audience would want that stack of pre-made characters to choose from anyways...just a mis step to not have them.

Definitely not for everyone, especially if you're looking for a heavy dungeon crawler with lots of dice chucking. But if you are a fan of a good narrative and branching plot points, then this game is a MUST and one of a kind. The closest game out there I can think of that mirrors open world sand box videogames, like Witcher or Fallout. Price point can seem a bit high, but worth every penny to me.

Incredibly well written and extremely entertaining. It's a "game" in the same way that a choose your own adventure book is; you're simply reading passages based on choices. What makes this more interesting, however, is that there are story points (state flags) that record certain things that have happened in the story and the various passages change based on what has happened in the world. Wonderful experience.

Watered down RPG or souped up Choose Your Own Adventure, the result is the same: A box of high quality paper waiting for a real purpose to come rescue it.

Had the game decided to focus on weaving together pieces of an entertaining story, rather than driving its errant agenda, it may have been more compelling. Even so, the system is capped at 'boring' no matter what the setting is, due to its simplistic stats and obvious choice points. 

In short, it's an empty, soulless walk down depravity lane.

It's a choose-your-own-adventure with a fancy box and pretty solid writing. The story is nothing special though, the usual fantasy tropes, and I gotta say there was nothing that surprised me at all. Well, one thing that was different was the amount of strong female characters that did make it stand out a bit. And it was way too easy!

For someone like me who considers gaming a matter of dreaming away instead of "winning" a game, this of course is a great experience.
I tried a few times a "read through adventure" book before, but this is simply better.

I don't know why exactly. Perhaps it is the lack of dice or the writing, but this FFG "game" is indeed better.
The creation of your character is already great with many more skills to choose from. But this gem succeeds in convincing me I actually walk in a world of adventure.

I guess the competitive euro gamer will not like it much. There is no "win" as such, nor is there a competition through planting vegetables or tiles.
The game system though is for those who love RPG's and dream away in their adventure games. It is very straight though, no Magic Realm magic...
As such it succeeds where sometimes more traditional games often fall short: story telling and mood setting. 
I can only hope this system will be expanded upon as it could be transferred to Mystery murder solving or HP Lovecraft spooky tales.

Replayability. I think yes there is at least room for 2 adventures through the whole series with complete different characters. And I think that after 3-4 years you could enjoy one or two more rides. Like in Ambush series.

It certainly helps when you would add a group to an adventure you already ran through and without revealing things, you could have really FUN with repeated plays.

With 15-20hours per box and going to 2 seperate playing sessions over the year, I think you will have 30-40 hours of fun with this box. That's more than an average video game will give you as STORY telling is concerned.

TLDR: Buy it if you wanted a RPG to play solo or with the wife.
Avoid it at all costs if you are a competitive gamer with euro play in mind.

The game group had a fun time with it. In the first session we did the intro book, then puttered around Dragonholt city for a bit, then ran through the "Slivers of Silver" quest. I do wish there was more "game" in this game though. As entertaining and different as it was, it really just felt like a group Choose Your Own Adventure session. There are no randomizers of any kind, so no dice rolling or card play. I wish it did include just a little more mechanical depth, but the storyline has been very entertaining.

RATING: 7
A game of D&D without the need of a group or even a Dungeon Master seems like a dream, and the chosen format seems to fit this intention perfectly. There are village side-quests, larger side-quests and plenty of locations to visit.

After a full campaign with a character that was definitely restrictive enough to ensure I could not possibly be tricked into making all the decisions *I* would (out of character) to simply see all of the game, I do feel I received so much information that the replayability seems very limited indeed. Also, some things are just very obvious; even if that does make sense and there are some nice twists here and there, there are moments where it spoils the fun a bit and further reduces replayability.

The indicative times printed on the quest books are obviously not intended for fast-reading solo players, as I went through all six quests and seven days of the game in about 8 hours total - significantly less than what I expected.

All of the above means that I am quite unlikely to replay this game, but I enjoyed most of the ride. Contrary to "legacy" games, there is at least no physical limitation to the number of plays with this one, so I do not feel cheated. A lot of care has gone into the details of each entry and there are lots of variables that make you feel the NPCs are indeed living their lives when nobody is watching. This game does a better job at that than several video games I have seen in my time, so I have nothing but praise for that!

However, upon completion I have to mention that the final chapter, Paper Faces, felt too scripted and linear. I put the game to the test by trying several different paths from certain points (mind you that all of this was included in the 8 hour play-time I mentioned!), all of which came down to the exact same point over time. This led me to the realisation that although many story points can be marked, there are just a few that will determine the ending. It is hard to enjoy the story once you know that certain outcomes will shape 99% of the ending for you. This is my main gripe with this game and the reason I scored it down a full mark.

Smooth, fun and immersive. The components are beautiful and contribute to the atmosphere. I appreciate that this is a pared back product and doesn't have an over the top number of cards or tokens like a lot of FFG products.

RATING: 8
Avoid this game if you're looking for crunchy mechanics - there aren't any here. What we have rather is more like a story-forward version of "Tales of the Arabian Nights." As in that game, you select skills at the game's start. Unlike that game, you don't move pieces around a board. Instead, you just hop from story element to story element, driven by Choose Your Own Adventure-style decision making. The goal is to choose options that cater to your party's skill set. This game shines with a communicative group of players who like to laugh. It's also works great for younger players as a "My First RPG."

Props for diversity and strong female characters. But I am really disappointed that the this game's developer felt the need to use and/or allow it as a platform for the LGBT agenda. Fantasy Flight, to each their own and it's your game but seriously, you should preface it somehow to buyers so they can make an informed purchase. It could have easily been eluded to in your many preview pieces on your site. Instead this game has come across as pretty shady and has caused me to lose a great deal of respect for FF games. Buyer be warned if you prefer not to be subjected to these type of themes (which are unavoidable plot points in this game's story).

The story is fine (though nothing too original) and fun to play through, but I would only play it as a solo experience which this is great as. I think it would be a bit boring multiplayer as how long do you want to read passages back an forth? 

Ultimately in hindsight I would have been happier having spent the $50+ on some good books which would have been waaaaay more value for the buck.

Not really a game but one of the most extensive interactive novels ever published. Kudos to Nikki Valens for creating a rich, detailed and also a believable world that is notable for its complete lack of typical old-style fantasy clichés like racism, homophobia or gender-prejudice. And you know what? This would actually be a good kind of world to live in! The writing by the way is excellent and of a higher quality than usual in these kinds of books. Now let’s hope that our status “C8” (earned for the “perfect” ending) will be of use in a second part that is equally engaging as the first.

The  game is like Choose Your Own Adventure in steroids. It gives players more agency through how it considers skills when branching stories. I wish the branches are more different one another, though, so the adventures can wildly varied playing one character to another.

RATING: 7
Yes, it’s a glorified choose-your-own-adventure. However, it’s really awesome once you get to Dragonholt Village and get a sense of just how many branching storylines there can be. Managing your time, items, and skills is interesting enough, and it takes zero effort to get back into your adventure from play to play.

My wife and I have completed this "game".  At first we enjoyed it, but as it went on, we had to force ourselves to play to get through the story.  We would not call this a game, so much as a "choose your own adventure".  It is not the hybrid RPG/board game we thought it was going to be.

It did have some strengths.  Character creation is good, and we did enjoy the diceless resolution system.  Also, we thought character advancement worked pretty well.  Also the "timing" element was interesting, and there was a lot of being in the right place at the right time.  In fact, maybe a little too much.

The problem was in being able to find the right places to go.  We "solved" it fairly quickly, but could never get to the right people in order to get that last bit of info, or make that one last confrontation.  In fact, we searched the entire village on a couple of occasions for specific people and information and got nothing.  I don't think this is bad design, just not always intuitive I guess.  The quests seemed very short, and do not expect to even go on all of them.  You likely will not unlock all quests - meaning, unless you plan to replay the game, you just aren't getting your full dollar value.  Since this is basically a big mystery, not sure how much replayability is there.  We certainly don't want to go through this again.  

We both came away thinking this is best a solo choose your own adventure, and for the money, there are many books that do that just as well.  We really hesitate to call it a game.

My wife also made an interesting observation.  All of the key warriors, and other strong characters were female.  For the most part (not 100%) male NPC's were portrayed as bumbling, or weak, and certainly in need of female protection.  It seems that this part of Terrinoth must be their equivalent of Amazonia or something.  This does not affect game play or enjoyment - but it was an interesting observation.

MINOR SPOILER:  The main story line involves a homosexual relationship between characters in the story, for which the player becomes involved in a very minor way and there is really no branch to let the player skip.  If this is an issue for you or your family then you will want to avoid this title.

Started playing with my children (8 and 9) and so far it's been a fun choose-your-own adventure/role-playing experience for us all.  They loved creating their characters.  It's a good story driven game for solo play or co-op with a couple similar minded gamers (I don't think I'd play with more than 3 players, myself included).  I realize the replayability is limited although I could see a possible second play through to experience different results.

I have yet to test this out. It does speak softly to my ear though. It has a few things going for it. It's set in the realm of Terrinoth (that hyper cool and interesting fantasy world created by FFG)and it's a sort of semi tabletop rpg and boardgame. Choose your own adventure and all that. Create your own character from the scratch. Create your characters backstory by yourself.

I’d rate it 8 when I recommend it to others, but for my own personal tastes it’s a 6.

Wow! Dragonholt is a breath of fresh air in the age of massive eruos and dice chuckers. This unique little RPG lite / Choose Your own Adventure on steroids places emphasis on your character creation to guide your story. The story is very well written and I was hooked immediately. I love the multiple options you are presented at each decision point. If you get really creative with your character's backstory and personality you can role play your decisions instead of picking the one you think is best. Once your character is created, being creative with your backstory is the longest part of the setup, you can jump into the game in about 30 seconds. Even if you only have 10 or 15 minutes you can jump in, do some adventuring, and then close it up. Amazing!

This is definitely a choose your own adventure game and not an RPG, adventure, or mystery type game. But it has a rich setting, great characters, and an intriguing plot. The gaming feels much smaller than choose your own adventure video games (like Telltale Games), but is definitely a step up from any book that is a choose your own adventure. There are mysteries to be solved along with the decisions you make and the character traits you choose to take and develop (much like RPGs) does impact what you can and can’t do. Great system. It feels familiar and yet done in a new way that has a lot of potential for the Oracle system to be used in other stories and genres as well. I have very much enjoyed this one as a solo player, but I think it could be just as fun with a group.

Basic CYOA / Consulting Detective-style game, but significantly more verbose and with mediocre, and sometimes childish writing. We played 4 people, and afterwards everyone felt it had been a bit too much.

There isn't really that much CYOA either, at least not compared to the reading you have to do. It's not rare for a player to simply sit and read aloud for 5-10 minutes before getting to choose anything.

So, somewhat disappointing, especially as a multi-player game. Perhaps it's better solitaire, if one can live with the writing?

One nice thing compared to Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective is the use of *state* when you visit locations, i.e. the outcome of visiting a location will depend on the day, time of day, and on what else you have discovered so far - unlike SHCD where the location text is completely static.

Overall, Legacy of Dragonholt is super! If you’ve never tried a pure narrative game before, this isn’t a bad place to start, and I’m not even a huge fan of fantasy! I won’t delve into that further but I imagine the reasons aren’t that hard to guess, but anyways. It’s got a lot of the nice parts of say, Dungeons and Dragons, but without as much complexity, making it feel more casual. Sure, there are things you can’t do here that you can do in D&D (mostly unscripted stuff since the entire game is kind of, well, pre-scripted and generated, to some degree), but you have to make tradeoffs somewhere. There will be some who lament that this isn’t a narrative game more in the vein of Near and Far (where there is a board game component but also a strong narrative) and I do love those kinds of games, but I would say that this wasn’t meant to be a game like those games, so I try not to judge it in the same way. To me, this is meant to be a more interactive form of the classic Choose Your Own Adventure-style books (as I’ve said), and I think it’s a really interesting system, in that regard. If you’re looking for a fun and straightforward narrative game or it’s your first time going anywhere near a narrative game, I’d highly recommend Legacy of Dragonholt! I’ve had a great time with it.

RATING: 2
The game is just a series of CYOA booklets.  While advertised as a group game that "captures the spirit of a roleplaying game without needing a game master" it falls far short of that mark.  The players take turns making selections out of the CYOA book, and certain options are only available if the person deciding has certain skills on their character sheet.  

There is no strategic decision-making to be done or problem solving. You just pick a path and hope it corresponds to what your character would have done in context.

The game plays the same with 1 player as with 6. Players can't cooperate with each other and have no other means of interaction.  It's a great introduction to running a real RPG as it will make you throw the book across the room in frustration with the limited format and decide to GM a real campaign.

However if someone is looking for a solo play experience with roughly the same complexity as the Choice of Games smartphone app CYOA games (The Lost Heir and Guns of Infinity Series), it could be fairly enjoyable, but expensive compared to those app options at $50.

Great single-player game.  Basically a CYOA with stats and some cards, but it is well written, especially with regard to passing time and events that bring the town to life.  Without the writing, this would be a waste of money.  I'd rather go through this narrative for a weekend than play an abstract strategy game for a year that has no story.  I hope that many expansions are written for this world.  Kudos to the goat scene in the forest.  I will remember that for the rest of my life.

What a fantastic experience game. I sat down and plowed through this over about 6 or 7 hours, and I had a great time. This feels a lot like Consulting Detective meets those old Fighting Fantasy books. You roll up a character, and proceed to take them on a choose your own adventure story. Even though I got the worst ending, I really enjoyed my time with Dragonholt, and plan on keeping it around to play again once I've forgotten all the twists and turns to the story. 

Dragonholt isn't perfect, however. I do feel like much of the character you create is largely irrelevant apart from the skills you learn. I think my race was only addressed once, and my gender never mattered at all. Along with that, I do feel like there were some segments of the adventure that felt a little grind-y and uninteresting. Almost like there wasn't enough time to flesh the story out further.

These are minor nitpicks, as I ultimately would love to see further content using this system. Whether that is in the form of expansions or an entirely new adventure. This is a sleeper hit for Fantasy Flight, and one that they shouldn't rest on their laurels with.

Streng genommen beschränkt sich der "Spielanteil" auf's Zeitmangement, sowie wenige Rätselelemente und etwas Itemeinsatz. Aber es macht dennoch einen Heidenspaß dieses Abenteuer zu erleben, denn es ist toll geschrieben, die Geschichte spannend und das vertraute Setting (Runebound) sorgt für Atmosphäre.

I love the concept of this game, but the story had some elements I really didn't agree with, and playing it became more of a burden than anything, when I had hoped it would really scratch my choose-your-own-adventure itch. Read up on it before you buy!

RATING: 6
I was hoping for something a bit more than a fairly standard choose your own adventure game where the multi-player aspect is essentially just to take it in turns making the decision.  Not sure what exactly I was expecting from this, but I guess just something a bit cleverer.  The writing's pretty good but it's set in the terribly dull world of Terrinoth.  The story doesn't exactly grab you from the off either.

"This is a sprawling cooperative set of choose-your-own-adventure books, with no randomness but with resource management. There is also a mystery in the story, which seems reminiscent of Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective, but it's a smaller part of the campaign than I had hoped/expected."

What I like:
- It's an interesting mix of Choose-your-own-adventure, RPG, SHCD, and boardgame
- Character creation was a fun (if long) exercise
- Seems very accessible to a casual gamer
- We are invested in the story to the point that a major plot development mid-campaign completely rocked us emotionally

What I don't like:
- The activation token system is clunky
- Initially, it's not clear who can/must make a decision
- The story itself says nothing about *you*, so you have to sort of put yourself in with storytelling
- We have had 3.5 sessions where we basically wandered around hoping something interesting would happen
- $60 is high (but hopefully will be totally worth it)
- Technically, I'm not sure it's a game, since I don't think you can win or lose (the rules say "if you enjoy the story, that's a victory")

As a 2-player game, I think it is important for whoever is NOT the active player to read from the book. That way, when it says things like "You wake up", or "Braxton winks at you", it's obvious who the "you" is. It will also help remind us to flip activation tokens at the right times. 

Rating started as an 8, but climbed to 9 at the end of day 3, when we felt the emotional impact of our choices. By the end of day 5, it's back to an 8, due to a boring stretch. At the end of the campaign, it gets an 8.

SPOILERS AHEAD!!!
My wife and I have played the following sessions (each about an hour):
- Created our characters
- Traveled to Dragonholt
- Learned about the main storyline and got assigned our first quest
- First major quest, plus a mini-quest in town
- In town, completed a mini-quest, and headed off toward our second full quest
- Completed our second full quest
- Bumbled around in town (market, shrine)
- Bumbled around in town (orchard, swan, market)
- Bumbled around in town (willow grove, fairfax manor, swan, bonfire)
- Defeated a dragon (quest), bumbled around in town (orchard, apothecary, hog)
- Bumbled around in town, attended a dull party, then fought the final battle. (2 hrs)

This is the type of game I have been waiting for. It is an RPG style game that doesn't require all the time investment of playing and preparing an RPG. I played the 1st quest with my kids, who have never played an RPG before, and they loved. Really looking forward to the other 5 quests in this set. I am hoping that FFG makes more of this team Fighting Fantasy/Lone Wolf style of game. Brilliant execution.

Replayability is questionable but it succeeded in getting me to care about the characters and see the story through (something Sherlock Holmes was unable to do for me). I play a lot of interactive novels that use similar systems to this game, so I really enjoyed it on that level. I can't imagine playing the game with a big group and think it would be best solo or with two players. Would love to see expansions or more games that use this system!

There's really no game here. It's literally a choose-your-own-adventure book with some, mostly, unnecessary RPG inspired character creation. Maybe there will be more in the subsequent adventure books. Here's hoping.

Best enjoyed as a solo experience.

It's basically just a really involved choose-your-own-adventure book. It's pretty well-written, although I would have preferred a more original setting. It plays okay as a group, but it will be just as enjoyable (and probably quicker) to play it solo.

Still early days (I'm on my first adventure out of the village) but I'm really enjoying this. The story is well written and interesting, and you feel like your choices really do make a difference, with some fun sub quests. Nothing new or amazing, but a very solid game nonetheless.

I really like the system so far.  It reminds me a little bit of those old text-based computer games from Infocom, like Deadline or Zork.  Also feels like Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective, but with more of the CYOA page flipping.  They did a good job with the character creation, which I initially thought I'd blow right thru, but I got into it enough that it made me care about my character and grounded me in the world/story.  Part of me wishes there was some dice based combat system, but I do like that I can play this from the couch.  Overall, really well done.  If they make more of these, I'll buy them.

Only game where you can log plays on BGG and progress on Goodreads at the same time.  It's a toofer.

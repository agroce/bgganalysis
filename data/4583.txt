RATING: 7
{3 plays, single deck, 2005} Finally learned this classic card game, and though it was fun, I must say I'm a little disappointed to discover that most of the game is in the bidding/gambling/passing and very little of it has to do with the actual card play.  Still, once you accept that this is really more of a social card game than a deep one, it's quite enjoyable.  And quick.

Someone could win this game with zero skill assuming their meld is high enough.

Two handed Pinochle is one of the greatest two player games ever made.

RATING: 5.5
Actually a good card game.  Seems like everyone plays it a little differently, and thinks their version is the "only real way to play". My family plays single deck 4-handed partership auction racehorse... another game I really enjoy in a family setting but have no interest in playing in a "gamer" stting.

(100+ plays) Bidding system is intense.  The problem is you spend 75% of the time waiting to get the bid to play and only 25% of the time thinking and playing.

RATING: 6
Pinochle is a good game with some major rules problems. A) No one plays the same rules. B) The forced trump/overtrump rules suck alot of skill out of the game (I play without them) C) Unlike Spades/Hearts/Oh Hell!/ etc. bad hands are crippling and the luck of the draw can sting you. I have had 5 or 6 games go by without much of a biddable hand. That said, a very breezy and social game played by almost all of my friends/family, so I can always get a game. I am sure I have played over 1000 times.

This is THE game for my family, as everyone is forced to learn how to play when they turn ten. We play practically all of the variants, single deck, double deck, pass/no pass, 5/6 player, 3 handed and 2 versions of 2 handed! This is the best game that you can play with a couple of decks of cards.

12/13

With extended family we have pretty much switched to Euchre, which is easier to play and drink. Still play pinochle at least least once every holiday I am with my folks and little sister, so I think it is still a "10".

Production: A standard Pinochle deck can be of nice quality, but the numbering is just non-intuitive (A-10-K-Q-J-9), which annoys me.  Play: I’ve only played standard Pinochle twice, but I’ve logged a hundred or so double-deck games against computer opponents.  A great trick-taking, partnership game.  Without the dummy hand of Bridge all players remain involved; it also has a simpler bidding mechanism than Bridge.  I like the restraint of forced-trump.  Melding is fun, but silly, as it rewards players for being dealt a certain hand; though it does provide a jumping-off point for bidding.  (1+1+3) (2 plays)

I love double deck partnership Pinochle, but the two-player game is very good as well.  (Rules on pagat.com).  Winner of each trick draws the top card from the stack, then may meld.  Meld remains on the table but is also part of your hand.  Lose the trick?  You can't meld.  When the draw pile runs out, melding is no longer allowed, the final 12 tricks are played for count cards and last trick only.

My favorite is Partnership Auction Pinochle (48 Card Pinochle Pack).  Played most in college with roomates.  Top four card game with Poker, Bridge, and Rummy.  Great four-handed partnership game.  Less serious than Bridge (not that this game doesn't require skill).  To me Bridge is to Chess as Pinochle is to Checkers.  Requires skill, but if you want to relax more; this is the game.  I like it better than Rook, Hearts, and Spades.  The two-handed version is okay, but not as good as Gin Rummy or Cribbage.

I have Two Red Bicycle Pinochle decks I use for Pinochle games.

RATING: 7
The first card game I ever learned taught to me by both of my grandfathers. I enjoy this trick-taking game more than most others that I have played. I find this one to be extremely unique with the meld phase. Sometimes I get frustrated with how much luck is involved in the meld, but if playing with seasoned opponents, the revealing of cards in your hand for meld points sometimes actually costs you during the trick-taking phase. The bidding is great as well.

I love the dynamics offered by the meld combinations, which keep hands unpredictable.  There are some really fun stakes games that can be played.  Two-handed, three-handed auction (with kitty & spades doubled), four-handed/double-deck partnership...  I haven't found a variation yet that I didn't love.

My family plays this over the holidays with a lot of variants. I've played games with 3 players up to 8, with a triple deck, which starts to become utter chaos.

For a good solid year double-deck partnership pinochle pretty much completely erased any interest I had in board games.  I could play this for 8 hours in one sitting, and often did almost every week.  If it weren't for the steep learning curve, I would play this much more often; as it stands I don't have people to play it with and it's too much of a commitment to get anyone to learn.  I will always hold out hope though...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A classic card game of my parents' generation, Pinochle is still an enjoyable passtime. A trick-taking game that favors those who bid aggressively, I often find it creates all-or-nothing situations that seem to reduce to a rather predictable dichotomy after a time. Nowadays, I consider it a gateway game to Doppelkopf, another trick-taking game which has supplanted it in my group.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Before 1/6/08, played (once/twice) years ago. Good strategy/luck mix w/ many variations; in-laws play double-deck. Two phases: bidding & trick-taking. 4 hands= 1 game. Deck is 4 standard decks of A-10. Dealer passes out 19 cards to each & 4 cards to "widow". Meld pts are: Trump run 16pts (A,10,K,Q,J), Roundhouse 24 (KQ each suit), Trump KQ 4, KQ 2 (2x=30, 3x=60), 1J each suit (es) 4 (2x=40), 1Q es 6 (2x=60), 1K es 8 (2x=80), 1A es 10 (2x=100), Pinochle JD&QS 4 (2x=30, 3x=60). Dealer's left opens bidding @51 or passes (out once passed). Jump bidding occurs when you have high meld pts (don't count trumps); shown by bidding higher in 1st round. Ex: 40 meld pts to open would start at 55. Bidding team is successful if meld count >= bid, otherwise "set" & lose bid pts. Count pts= A,10,K taken in trick/widow discard. Widow is shown, bid winner discards ANY 4 cards, declares trump, all show melds, record meld pts & play std. trick-taking round (except must over-take [higher card/trump] if you can; & 2pts for taking last trick).

RATING: 6
BIG problem here is rewarding players for melding which is just getting a good hand by the random card draw and has nothing to do with good play...not good. Sure you have to bid accordingly and bidding takes some skill but you still score based on how good of hand you got dealt overall. Once the auction is over, trick play is very standard. So many better games where skill is more highly rewarded.

Possibly some variants are better but all these types of games that [i]overly[/i] reward getting dealt a good hand are far from optimal. Maybe 2 player is acceptable not sure, likely very high ratings are nostalgia and/or house-ruled versions, its still a fun and enjoyable game but the luck ouch... Oh and being forced to over-trump your partner or trump a trick he is winning are silly rules too, nevermind you can't throw off
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The best trick taking card game that exists. This is very good with 2 or 3 players but simply outstanding when playing a 4-player partnership game. One of my all-time favorite card games. This is in my lunchtime card group's regular rotation, in fact we started off exclusively as a Pinochle group. The more you play the better you'll get, especially if you play with the same partner consistently. I created a little cube (2"x2") with the four suits and two blanks sides to make the trump so people don't forget each hand. It's been very helpful.

We always play double-pack partnership, wipeoff (each side needs at least 20 points in tricks or they score at most 0 for the hand).

There are some quality decisions in this game, and a few hands are edge-of-the-seat thrill rides.  There are also some hands where there's very little interesting to do.

Double Deck Pinochle. All the worst of arcane trick-taking games: bombastic all-honour deck (hey I got six aces but so does everyone else); fancy scoring combinations (where cards can go in multiple ones but sometimes not); being doubly rewarded for lucky deals (melds and tricks); putting your cards on the table, then scooping them up again to play the hand (how's that for hidden but trackable information); enforced plays (yo partner, I'm really happy for you, I'mma let you finish but I'm trumping your high card).

Update: I would rate Two-Player Pinochle, which is basically the same thing as Bezique, a point higher, and still be content never to play.

It's a shame that it tends to get lost in the shuffle (ha) with so many other games competing for attention. I should really play it more often. I primarily play three player single deck A 10 K score ten, and greatly prefer it to other variants.

Classic trick taking game - I've played this since I was a child at family gatherings.  It's not something I'd really recommend (And it's actually a fairly complex trick taking game to teach with some unintuitive rules and melding) but it is a game I expect to continue playing for a long time.

Wow. What's the point? It's pieces of Rummy and a trick-taking game with a shout-out to Hearts without retaining the core essence of any of these games. Luck is huge on the melding, and putting your cards out there isn't much of a disadvantage. There might be some tricks to the trick-taking, but not much. This is mostly about knowing the scoring system, and that's about it. Boring.

I finally learned to play this classic game (double-deck with 20-point minumum meld and trick points to score). I really like the ideas behind the game, but it's way too luck-based when compared to other trick-taking games. The fact that you are compelled to win the trick, regardless of whether your partner is winning it already or that you know they will be able to win it, ruins the card play for me. I realize that after a while, you will see some limited ways to manipulate this rule in your favor (or at least to the detriment of your opponents), but the play is so counter-intuitive to the majority of trick-taking games out there that I would never get to that point. I think this is a game that thrives on nostalgia (i.e. lots of families played this and kids were allowed to interact with adults in ways they might not ever have been able to do otherwise). I'd much rather play any number of other trick-taking games, including Hearts, Spades, Tichu, any of the Dalmuti-style games, etc.

I really used to like two-hand pinochle (the original form of the game).  Tried four-hand once and didn't care for it.

I grew up playing rummy, and trick-taking games never clicked with me. But in this game, the trick taking makes sense to me: you plan and time it so you can make point-scoring melds!

getting familiar with this game I think will increase my ratings

Now played 4 player with passing.  I think I will enjoy this more when my group settles down with one format. At least for a bit while I get used to it.

Feb 09-We're now settling down with 4 player, with passing.  I'm starting to really enjoy it.

*Note-you can play 3p. Everyone gets 15 cards & 3 go in a kitty (or whatever). Whoever wins the bid gets to look at it before declaring trump.  Interesting variant.

Have been playing this 7-player recently, 6-decks. (Jan, 07). 

2014: I played this for about 6 months, twice a month on Sunday back in 2007 with a bunch of guys in their 60's. It was an interesting social experience, they had some custom rules for everyone-against-one, and they changed the bidding thresholds constantly to try to get it "just right". The problem for me was, the game had only one decision during the bidding, and MAYBE one or two 'decisions' during offensive play, per hand. You would spend hours at the table, maybe get 1-2 truly biddable hands per hour on offense, and maybe one decision on defense.

If you really wanted to take the time to count the melds, it helped your play. I had a hard time working up the desire to bother.

The old-timers just thought there was so much depth to this game - and there wasn't. Not by a long shot.

After about 10 or so attempts, I finally "won a night", and quit immediately after that night, never returned.

The main host passed away a couple of years ago, I don't think the group gets together much any more.

Sweet men, I did really love them all, but this game is a relic.

I am glad they play it - more people should get together and play games IMO, but I wish they would play Bridge or Mu or something that is more of a game.

To each his own.

Love you guys! Thanks for the memories.

This is the first real card game I learned from my family.  Another trump/trick taking game.  The big differences in this game are that it is played with a double Euchre deck without the joker, the jacks are not Bars/bauers, and that each round is played with a "melding" phase, which awards you points for your cards in hand, and then a second phase for playing tricks involving a trump suit.

Pinochle is an old-time favorite of mine.  I rarely get to play it because it takes three other people who know how to play and love it as much as I do, and it's very rare that I find those people.

I have two things that I really enjoy about pinochle.  The number one thing I enjoy about pinochle is starting with a hand of cards and trying to decide the best order to play them.  When you know you have to play every card, you have to analyze your own weaknesses while guessing what your opponents have as strengths.  That is a lot of fun.  It's one part push your luck, one part risking everything.  There is a strategic advantage to playing cards in a certain order.  Know when to play for tricks and when to sit back is important, fun and I do it almost with intuition.  

The other thing that I really enjoy about pinochle is the interplay between partners.  When two people must work together without giving each other information about their resources, tons of fun will happen.  Maybe the person with the weaker hand will take the bid.  Sometimes, the person who takes the bid needs certain cards, but his partner passes the wrong ones.  While that might be disappointing as it happens, it sure is exciting!

I really enjoy this game.  It's fairly simple, but I play this with my family quite a bit.  Four handed is preferable to three handed, but they are almost completely different games (we play passing 4 with four players and taking 3 random cards with three).  The best part of this game is looking at the hand you are dealt, especially when you see a strong suit and lots of meld . . . unless someone has too many 9s and the hand gets mucked.

I'm a particular fan of double-deck pinochle, played with partners.  A huge handful of cards makes for long stretches with plenty of room for strategery.  This is no game of bridge -- there's time for conversation and heckling and in my opinion that's part of what makes the game so much fun.  A great social game, and a great game to boot.  Lots of fun.    Haven't played in years, but I'd bet I've put in 100 or more 500 point games.  For a short period of time I was the undisputed pinochle champion of the universe; at least that's what the trophy said . . .

What can you say about Pinochle? It&#039;s a classic, and it&#039;s what has taught us games of this genre... trick taking, trump, and putting the cards in a wierd order. More challenging then Euchere, but not as brain wracking as Bridge. Everyone who plays ANY trick taking games should know this one.

A found this to be a slightly more finicky version of [b]Euchre[/b]. It does add some interesting ideas, but these additions seem too fiddly when compared to the simple elegance of [b]Euchre[/b] - for instance, why does the 10 have to have a higher value than K-J and 9? Seems completely arbitrary. Gameplay would not change at all if you simply ranked the cards in their traditional order. It's these small little details that just seem cumbersome than add strategy.

[50+ plays] To me, this is a very average card game with few of the tactical or strategic options that I find interesting in better games. This opinion is strongly influenced by decades old memories, so take it for what it's worth, which may not be much.

Most recent play probably in 1984 or so.

One of my favorite trick-taking games for 2. We play the "original" version (the one similar to Bezique). Last Christmas, I taught the partnership version to my family. Everyone seemed to like it better than the traditional Hawaiian card game, "Trumps" (ie, bid whist). 

Michelle prefers this over 66, I think because I'm not smart enough to count cards in this game (she is completely unaccustomed to card tracking). In 66, you pretty much have to keep track of everything that gets played, which is tedious and annoying.

Classic game. The only game I can get my Grand Father to play with me on a regular basis. It is fun and has some interesting choices depending on what you get, but the high value of meld makes the game too luck dependent. If meld was reversed (all aces worth few and all jacks worth a lot) and betting redesigned for that factor the game would be more fun. I find it silly that you're rewarded for getting good cards and then rewarded again for playing the good cards.

RATING: 4
Summary: 4 player, Bid a points total for melds+tricks, declarer sets trumps and exchanges 4 cards with his partner, everyone makes melds, then play tricks basically as per normal. 

Everything about this game rubs me the wrong way. The lackluster bidding system, making melds which are 90% luck of the draw, forced trumping, forced over trumping, very little partnership interplay, etc. 

Look if it's the go to game for your area then by all means have at it but there are simpler games that are just as interesting so why bother with this.

RATING: 8
I go back and forth on this game. Sometimes it's a 6; sometimes it's an 8. It's a midwestern favorite with both family and friends. Aggressive bidding and skillful card play make the game a great partnership experience. My major criticism is the randomness of the meld. Bidding and play can, to a certain extent, make up for unlucky deals. However, runs and double pinochles are so dominant as to make the game frustrating at times. If this game wasn't so ingrained in the culture around here, I might try to push for alternate rules.

The three-player game comes in two varieties. One is derived from the four-player partnership game. It's alright, but a bit loose in the scoring. I prefer the older version where you can only score if you take the bid, which is truer to its roots. On the other hand, the two player game is a completely different experience, and worth a look (similar to Bezique).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Used to play double pinochle (2 decks, no 9s, partners) with my family constantly on vacations etc.  There's so much luck when you know what's going on.  my basic formula for bidding: 

max bid = 15 + Your meld in hand + # of trump in hand + # of aces in hand + your partner's meld (if they gave you a meld bid) 

Not a set in stone rule, but it's generally a good max bid

I grew up playing this game, and the complexity and deepness still surprise me. We play 4-player, single deck with 4 card passing and no "Shoot the moon" rules (bidding also starts at 250). I'm almost always up for a round of Pinochle or two. Granted, there are flaws. The biggest one I can think of is that you're only as good as your partner. Hopefully the partnerships are balanced, which leads to a more enjoyable game.

I've tried many other standard card games, but this one is still my favorite.

RATING: 7
My family is big into card games as well as board games, and Pinochle is my favorite of the former.  It requires more strategy than other games I've played (ie. Setback), but sadly I feel like this is a dying card game. I've not met a single person in my peer group that had even heard of Pinochle. It was easier getting my friends addicted to Malta! than getting them to try Pinochle at least once. When playing at home, I prefer three- or four-player games to two-player.

I don't get trick taking games, especially like Pinochle.  The only interesting choice is what to bid, and everything else it is just an exercise in optimization (simple optimization).  I don't know how or what to trade and then what to play when it is time, but I don't know if I want to know how.  My family loves this game, so I'm sure I'll be playing for the rest of my life though.  I'm sure I'll figure it out some time.

Update: So I've gotten to the point where I can trade with my partner and know what to bid.  But really, it is a very very random game.  It all depends on what you are dealt and very little to do with the choices you make beyond bidding.

My wife's extended family plays pinochle almost to exclusion of other games and so I needed to learn.  I found the learning curve pretty steep (my family played cribbage and rummy so trumps and tricks was a new concept as was the "out of order half a deck").  I do enjoy the partner game well enough to play with extended family when offered, but I am completely played out of our two player variant, much to my wife's dismay as she still loves Pinochle in all its forms for nostalgia reasons.

What a hoot, a brilliant party game that makes us laugh. The rubber animals, the cards and barns are high quality which gives a good feel to the game.

RATING: 6.2
This is a pure party game with no strategies involved.  Players get to choose an animal and dictate what the sound of the animal should sound like.  After the phase, depending on the difficulty of the game players played, players may keep their animals in a barn and players need to remember not only the sounds of the animals but also the animals each players dictate.  Every player will take turns to flip a card.  The player who flips the card and the player whose animal is shown on the card will have to mimic the sound of each others’ animal.  The one who has a slower reaction will take the animal card.  At the end of the game, the player with the most cards lose the game.

Good points: A game that is easy to play.  It is also noisy as well when players mimic the sounds of animals (usually) loudly during their exictment.

Bad points: A game of pure memory and reaction with no strategies in place.

fun, silly game when played among adults.  it's insane how disadvantaged players are when they're flipping their own card, since everyone else gets to focus on the flipper's animal alone.  i wouldn't really want to own it, but i'll gladly play it as a dumb filler.

Fun but silly party game. You go in turn order flipping over animal cards until 2 players have the same animal on their cards. Then, whoever makes the sound of the animal IN THIER PEN gets rid of their cards. The funny thing is, you want to make the sound of the CARD flipped over and you have to remember what animal everyone has in their pen. It's quite silly and always gets good laughs. Good game for kids as well.

RATING: 7
Underrated, goofy party game that puts a funny animal twist on "Jungle Speed." Yes, it's super light, and yes, it does look goofy when a bunch of adults sit around a table and make animal noises. But let's not get caught up in the lack of advanced strategy and depth of play this game offers. You might look goofy, but you're also having FUN.

Although I'm aware that other games share a similar mechanism, this one is the one for us.  We absolutely love the way this game takes on the speed aspect of games like Spoons, Jungle Speed, etc.  The mechanism is so basic (almost like War) you just flip a card from your stack face-up onto the table and see if it matches someone else.  What makes this game shine for us is that there is no threat of injury grabbing for some item in the middle of the table, because when there's a match you just have to make the right sound.

The other draw of this game is just the silliness of it all.  I mean you have little plastic barns with little animals in them.  And if that toy factor isn't enough, the fact that you have to make the sound the animal makes in order to win the matches gets everyone giggling and will draw in crowds of onlookers.  The final piece of the puzzle for this game is the added memory aspect.  You have all this chaos going on around you, and yet you have to try and remember what animal is housed in each barn.  And when you play more than one game in a row, it can throw off even the best memorizers.  This game is a classic that works for adults, teens, and children that will never leave our collection.

For a family game, I've never had so many arguments and hurt feelings surround a game as much as this one.  I don't know why, but my kids take this one personally.  I'm not much of a fan of it for just that reason.  It could be a great game under other circumstances.

An excellent family party game. Great for all ages. Snorta! can be an extremely funny game trying to blurt out the "sound words" of your opponents animal if you can remember them! It's incredibly simple to learn yet incredibly enjoyable to play. I highly suggest more then 4 players during this game!

Sometimes you just need a simple hilarious fast paced game and this one fits the bill.

Game sessions usually include a few loud around the table snorta's/laughs!

Good silly fun -- great for families.  My 8 year old calls this the "game of laughter."  We've rolled off our chairs laughing at times.  Before I bought this I worried it would only be good for 6  people, but I actually prefer the 4 player game (though it is still great fun for 6; haven't tried more yet).

UPDATE:  Reading the comments, I see a number of people who say you need 6  players.   I must disagree.  With 6 people, the card flipper (the person whose turn it is) is at a huge disadvantage, having to scan 5 people's cards instantly to find matches, whereas each other player just has to see if his/her card matches the card flipper's card.  With 4 players it is a more balanced dynamic.  In any case, my family of four has a blast with this game.  Please don't let the commentators who say you need 6 players or more scare you away from getting this one for your family.

While hilarious, this game led me to coining the term "fight-making game" for my family. It is NOT fun for us to try to figure out who made the correct sound first, and I think it is never fun to just keep loading more and more cards (and more and more LOSER experiences) onto particular people. Obviously, it works for others.

If you have kids this game will be great!! It's a game of memory.  Difficult to explain, but easy to play.  Your looking at the aminals on the cards, but what you have to remember and recite is the animal sound of the player who has the matching animal card (each players animal is hidden in their barnyard). Love watching the kids play.

We have a lot of fun with this one!  Sounds simple until you try it and get completely tongue tied trying to remember who has what animal (though my daughter always wants to be the kitty cat, try as I may to explain to her that this puts her at a disadvantage).  I thought my son was going to choke himself when he was jumping up and snorting/quacking/meowing trying to get the right animal.  We have the Mattel version which has much better artwork IMO.  Most appropriately named game I know since if you get a big enough group together to play, invariably someone will end up with their drink shooting out of their nose.  Hilarious!

Fun party game or with little kids.  

We first played this as a party game.  It's actually kind of hard and has led to a lot of laughs.

We then modified it for kids by removing the barns and a bunch of the cards to make it go quicker.

I literally can only play a few games before I am totally spun around.

Production: Great barns and animal figurines.  Unfortunately, most of the game is in the cards, which are of poor quality (though they have fun artwork).

I got this in anticipation of a family party.  It is Animal Snap in a box.  When you reveal a card from your personal deck which matches the top card of another player you have to make the sound of the animal they are.  Trouble is, you only get told the animal that each person is at the very beginning of the game and, adult memories being what they are, this fact soon escapes all but the youngest players whose memory synapses work far more effectively.  Good fun for a mixed age group, young and old, for the 10 minutes it lasts.

Played it with 6 people at the college game club.  We laughed a lot.  It's amazing mow such a simple concept will tie your brain in knots.  You know you have to make a frog sound immediately, and somehow just some other jumbled mess comes out of your mouth.  Meanwhile someone is quacking at you from across the table.  It's probably best for adults to play this one without little kids, at least with all the swearing it caused in our group.

RATING: 5
This game can be pretty fun and quite hilarious when the group gets into it. However, you have to get into the "fun" more than the "game". It's silly when the animal sounds are flying around the table and people are frantically trying to remember what's hidden under the barn. It's frustrating on your turn as everyone else has been mentally reviewing the table in preparation for your card flipping over.

A silly, light party game that works great with kids and pretty well with inebriated adults. It's a memory game that requires making the appropriate sounds of many different farmyard animals. Not a game for the timid.

This isn't the 'coolest' party game to introduce to adults, but once the gameplay begins, anyone will ignore the fact that they're playing with cute little plastic farm animals because the tension is high and the laughs are numerous.

RATING: 7
A simple, fast, if not "udderly" stupid memorization-type/spit game. Gobs of fun as normally serious-looking people make funny animal noises, in a desperate attempt to get rid of all their cards. It's a great party game that can easily accommodate up to 8 players, and easily accessible to all ages and dispositions. However, once the novelty wears off, I must admit I'm ready for the game to end. With a co-ed mix, it's very good as an ice-breaker.

This is really a kids' game, but it's pretty fun for what it is.  You see each player's animal at the beginning of the game, and after that they are hidden in their barn.  When you and another player have the same card face up in front of you, you have to make the noise of their animal before they make the noise of yours. If you beat them, they take the stack of cards in front of you.  You win by getting rid of your entire deck.

What a fun, silly game. I love memory and reaction games, so I naturally like Snorta. When a friend was explaining this to me, I thought this was going to be a very bad game, but is quick and fun to play.

The component minis are gorgeous and you can explain the game under 1 minute.

Excellent to introduce new gamers or family into our hobby. A must have for me. Every time we play it two or three times in a row.

I still like Snorta, but my desire to play it again is low. The funny thing is that I don’t want to play it anymore, but when I do, I have fun.

Since the beginning of this year (2017) I began reducing (or trying to) my game collection so the game has to go. I would still play it if requested though.

RATING: 7
A fun party game that doesn't revolve around trivia or words.  I like the memory and speed aspect of the game, and making animal noises only increases the silliness factor.  The additional confusion of looking for an animal match makes it hard to remember who has what noise, especially when playing with the full complement of players (which seems better).  I guess if someone had a super memory, it would be no challenge, but I think this game is quite fun.

First game my wife LOVED. She won't play anything. So I found her an original copy with the little barns. She literally hoots. After one person changes animals, the games over for me. I can't multi-task and remember all those animals. Not a good game if you wear bi-focals. Must be played in a tight circle. Too fast a game for me. There's no strategy, pure observation and memory. And chaos. And embarrassment. Sorry. Have fun, kids. But my wife likes it.

I'm not big on party games, as a rule, but there are exceptions, and Snorta! is one of them. The rules are dirt simple, the premise is fun, and people are making silly noises, so what's not to like, really?

The part that gives Snorta enough challenge to be worth playing is the fact that you usually want to make the sound of the animal you flipped over, rather than that of the player who matched you. The part that makes it funny is watching someone go randomly through animal noises because he can't remember which one is right.

Dumb fun that anyone can play. Not something I'd play often, but when I'm with the right crowd I play it happily.

Similar to Jungle Speed in that you flip cards and when there's a match something happens.  In this case the 2 people who's cards match race to make the sound of the other's animal.  The catch is that the animals are all hidden (in small barns) so the more people that play the zanier it gets.  

I'll never be good at a speed/memory game but this one's not too bad.  Some people are really going to enjoy this.

Wow. What a hoot! ;) For a party game, this is the most brainy. It's not that you have to be smart, but it's the levels of recall and connections that have to be made to play. So funny, and the catch of this seemingly simple game is that your brain wants to do what's on the card, but you have to remember the hidden animal of an opponent. This was  a huge surprise and an EXCELLENT thrift!

It's just another silly speed-match game, like Jungle Speed or Anomia, but the thing that brings Snorta to the next level is the mindfuck of remembering what animal is hiding behind your opponent's barn and not confusing it with the matching animals on the table.

Late night enjoyment at cons, or good times with the kids.

RATING: 4
First impression: I can see this would be fun when played at parties. Game is a bit too simple as you can concentrate to see if anyone turns up another card same as yours. Usually the player in turn is at disadvantage (more so if there are many players) against all others because of this. Halli Galli shares the same mechanic but there everyone must be aware of all cards on the table so player in turn gets more fair chances if he has lightning fast reflexes.

A humorous family and/or party game.
Players begin by introducing their animal by making the sound and tucking the animal into their personal barn.

The game begins and each player flips a card in front of them and once two players cards match then the fun begins.
One of the two players must make the animal sound of the other player...not the animal on the card and not your own or anyone else's animal sound.
The faster player gives the slower player all of their face up cards.
Once someone is out of cards the game is over.

When I first bought this, I thought my kids would love it and I would love playing it with them. But as it turns out, they struggle with the concept of saying the animal sounds fast enough and I prefer to play the other games we have.

I have the card game. I cannot give this game more than a 6, because it's really a stupid game, but I cannot give it less then a 6, because actually performs well when around a table with many children and generates a lot of laughs and shouts. It's anyway a short-period game, that can be played for a few minutes and just once: good for Christmas, then throw it away. Maybe children will use it sometimes during their party, but it doesn't make sense to play this game more than once.

RATING: 6
Snap-style card game in which the two players who match with their flipped card have to quickly make the animal sound of the opponent's animal identity given at the beginning of the game. The OTB version differs from the original card game in that the identity is kept secret with the plastic animal covered by their barn, so a memory element means some players sputter through various noises before pining the right one. Fun to listen to and see, ideal for kids and those scared of Jungle Speed (which is a similar but a more tense experience as it penalises mistakes). We sometimes play a Japanese variant in which you have to make the Japanese sound for the animal, which believe me is strange. Rating for the lush OTB version.

RATING: 4
This game requires just the right group of people. It is silly and fun for a short time. Once played you may as well blow the entire evening by following it up with a challenging game of Apples to Apples.

*** To be fair - I have introduced this game to more than one hundred people including youth groups. As dopey as this game is, it has always proved popular and never fails to generate laughs. There is something special about his game that, though stategy, decisions, tactics, etc. is totaly absent, the game  entertains. In the final analysis, that is what is important.

Yes it is a memory game and your memory will get fuzzy with or without alcohol. The enjoyment is trying to watch people think of the sound to make. Gets real amusing as you play a couple of rounds and people have different animals.

Would rate it as a 7 or an 8 as a kids game.  But as a party game, it's a silly version of Jungle Speed.  While it produces laughs at times it's the same joke throughout the game that can get trying after repeated plays (I can imagine my non-gaming relatives latching on to this one and asking for repeated plays).  But at least it keeps you involved in the game trying to find your matches, Jungle Speed is just more compelling.

AKA Jungle Mouth. 

This is essentially Jungle Speed, where when you match instead of grabbing a totem, you make the sound of the animal that the person is that you match with.  You don't get to see the animal so there is a memory aspect.  Cute once.  Probably really fun with kids.  Not a whole lot more to it.

It is particularly funny when neither party can remember the animals.

Similar to Jungle Speed but lacking the manual dexterity aspect.  What it lacks in dex, however, it makes up for with goofy animal noises!

This game is a lot of fun, but once you've established the sounds of other players (easier than you think), it becomes a bit too easy.  I would imagine there's some more chaos you can add in to make it a bit tougher.

I also think some of the sensibilities of Jungle Speed could be added to improve the gameplay for more advanced players (loser leads, faults, etc).

Still, lots of fun!

[Out of the Box long box (2004) edition] {Animal, kid; real-time, memory, intimation; optimal 6p} Snorta! is a loud and fun party game. It is a novel reaction game that players do not compete with hands but by making animal sounds. This is an interesting children game but adults may find it too silly. It's engaging, fast-paced and quite interactive. However, it lacks the mechanics to affect multiple players, as in Jungle Speed, which I think can increase excitement and make the game more engaging. I want to add 1 / 2 swap cards to the game, which can make Snorta! more fun - more dynamic and chaotic.

The plastic animal figures and animal house are cute. Actually, I don't know the exact sound of some animals, though it's not important.

This game is much, much tougher than it appears. We played this at 2am and it was surprisingly hard remembering 5 others' 'animal noises' which you need to be able to recall and imitate immediately.

You're also looking at other pictures of animals for pairs which confuses your brain even more.

Silly, difficuly, somehow fun in a weird kind of way, but not one I'd be overly keen to play again.

In Snorta each player is given a plastic farm animal (cute cartoonishly-designed ones by John Kovalic). In a "sound-off" everyone makes their animal's sound, then hides it in their barn. All the animal cards are passed out. Each player quickly flips over cards into a face-up pile in front of them, going around the circle. When a card placed down matches one of the cards already on the table, those two players rush to say the animal sound of the other player. (You don't make the noise of the animal ON the card.) It's hard to remember everyone's animal under pressure, so this speed and memory game is lively and funny to play. If you say the other player's sound first, you give them all the cards you've flipped onto the table in front of you. They then add them to the bottom of their hand. The first person to get all the cards out of their hand is the winner.

Think Egyptian Rat Screw with a memory element and with barnyard animal noises thrown in for fun.  Good for a party game.  Insists that players take it very lightly.  Not going to go over well with serious gamers.  The game is about making animal noises based on matching cards, after all.  Idea is really, really simple, but it's still really difficult to keep all the other players' animals straight.  Good to play with kids and nongamers when looking for a party game.  Plus, you're never too old to make cock jokes about the player who got stuck with the rooster.

Commented after two plays: Nice, simple and fast party game. We played with four, but might be nicer with bigger group - and faster players. If everyone starts their turn by remembering the other animals, the game is not that fast and maybe not that fun either.

Each player selects an toy animal figure from a bag and mimics the noise that animal makes to start the game.  The rest of the game is a bit like spoons and memory put together - watching for a match and then squeeling like a pig, hooing like an owl, or ssssing like a snake as you can.

Kinda silly, but fun. I think this is based on a card game called animal snaps.

My wife digs this game and it is fun to get the spirit of things, but not quite my cup of tea.

$%*#! I suck at this game.  Totally fun - even my 14 yo son grudgingly admitted he had fun and liked it.

Funny animal sounds are not for me. Could be fun in the right group. Very nice bits.

Really fun party game that turns everyone into an ANIMAL! Or at least makes them sound like one. Great light-hearted fun!

Making animals can be fun but this game can get repetitive. I think this game would be better with more swap cards.

Great bits, great Kovalic art. I've played with my 3-year old son using some "house rules" -- making this more a memory game than a party game. With adults it's a light memory game with some interesting mental trickery... Some people can mentally focus on what they need to say, while others are subject to their whims to cry out the sound of the animal on the card or in their own barn, rather than their opponent's.

This is an awesome party game. Great fun with a mixed crowd of adults and kids. Not for less than 6 players though.

On a sidenote, Tactic has given this game the name "Quackle!" in Sweden, and an absolutely horrible box. The box art ensures that nobody will get this without having played it first. Such a shame...

Funny party game! Good for groups mixed evenly with both genders.

Fun, simple...but not very easy.  There's actually quite a bit of tension as you watch each person flip a card, attempting to remember their respective animals.

After 1 Play: Silly game that rewards memory and a quick reaction time.  I'm all for forcing gamers to make silly animal sounds, but I think there's a better way to do it.

Cada jugador recibe un animal. Cuando al descartar sus cartas esta coincide con la carta descartada por otro jugador, ambos deben hacer el sonido representativo del contrincante. Quien lo logre primero ganará y el otro se llevará todas las cartas. El primer jugador en deshacerse de todas las cartas gan. Para morirse de risa.

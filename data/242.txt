RATING: 6
Based on 1 play with 6 players.
I was a little nervous about this game when the reading of the rules/explaining of the game to everyone (by our normally excellent games explainer) took over an hour.  Apart from that I loved the idea, though I don't normally like negotiation games.
Four hours in I stopped loving it and started hoping for the end.
The game would be improved for me by shuffling the money stack and then taking half of it and putting it in the box - hopefully cutting game time by half.  A 3 hour game of Junta would have been great.

2nd game played.  It is a really fun game, but just far too long.

EL JUEGO MÁS DIVERTIDO POR EXCELENCIA, de la categoría de "Pierde amigos" XD. Se reparten los cargos políticos, y el presidente propone repartir entre ellos, el pobre presupuesto de la ayuda extranjera llegada a la república bananera... Ya se sabe la pasta es la pasta... xDDD Por supuesto puedes enviar asesinos a por los que se lleven más dinero... hasta que las movidas deriven en un golpe de estado, y el juego pasa al tablero a un juego totalmente distinto, de lucha por el control de 3 de 5 zonas, del bando pro-presidente vs. bando rebelde, un poco a lo ""wargame"" y a darse de leches que se acabó la diplomacia! Al final, quien tenga más pasta en su cuenta suiza secreta, ganará la partida. Ultra recomendable para jugones negociadores y maquiavélicos xD Y de tema muy actual! Este juego envejece con los años como el buen vino tinto! Y ya es un gran reserva xD

Comentar que es para jugarlo con mínimo 5, 6 e ideal con 7 personas en concreto. Es la virtud/inconveniente del juego. El peor defecto: Los materiales, en las 3 ediciones en ingles y la de "El golpe" de Borras en castellano, son similares y a la antigua. Este juego pide a gritos una reedición en condiciones!

I've always liked this one, but one really negative thing is that you need the 7 players for it to be really fun, and finding that many for three or four hours is in itself quite a task...

RATING: 5
For me this is just too long for what it is and this is mostly the combat round. There doesn't seem to be too much to offer during negotiations other than saying you're not winning. Think things like Resistance and One Night Ultimate Werewolf offer similerish mechanics in a much shorter time frame.

I spent a lot of my formative years playing this game in pubs across Northern Wales, so my opinion is probably rose tinted - I like the game an awful lot, the theme is spot on and the mechanics work well. Usually you can get a game in under 2.5 hours which isn't bad for something of it's weight (assuming you don't get a sociopath starting a coup every other round).

Mechanics show their age. Less fun in the likely event a small group of people can control the first 75% of the game through collusion. They'll eventually eat each other because there must be one winner, but they'll have left the others in the dust long ago.

Get IN there, and get DIRTY. This is a top rated game for all the right reasons. I havn't found a better game for backstabbing and general foul play. Always best played with the full seven players, and outrageous attempts at the accent.
Any 'President' who fails to make me the 'Minister for Internal Security' is looking for a hard time. This should not be confused with the 'President' who does make me the 'Minister', and therefore also gets a hard time.
PLAY THIS GAME, if you know what is good for you.

A great game, provided you play it with seven, or at least six players. Probably not a game for bad losers. If your group contains a few aggressive players, so much the better.

First game was confusing as it wasn't obvious what needed to be done, or what each action would lead to. Now that I've played I expect to have a better idea in the future, if I play again.

I think I would have normally given this a 3, but combine that with the chinseyness of the whole game, and it really doesn't register on the radar. 

The game mechanics feel broken. There's no sense of accomplishment in the game, and for how little actually happens throughout the course of the game, it takes forever.

I highly doubt I'll be playing this again.

RATING: 3
Based on one 6-player game (I can see however, that a 7-player game should balance things a bit better).
--

If it was at least fast moving... but as it stands, once players are cut out from the President's favorites (not receiving money and constantly being assigned the pretty powerless roles of Commander of the Navy/ Air Force) the game becomes very frustrating. There is no catch up mechanism designed into the game: therefore it becomes a waiting game until enough resistance builds up for another Coup to happen (this may take more than 1 hour).
In this situation all one can hope for is to draw (2 cards/ round) a good card (e.g. Assassin). Unfortunately the draw deck is also very swingy.
For a 4++ hour long game this becomes a very frustrating exercise.

RATING: 7
Loved this game years ago when I was a student and now my children are just about old enough to understand it I can't wait to get it out again. I've kept it for 30 odd years, that's how much I rate it.
Update: In retrospect, I'd over-rated it. Still fun, but the component quality such as the cards isn't brilliant, and the fact it plays best with five or six makes it difficult to get to the table.

First game. I was pretty apprehensive about this game, but turned out to be pretty fun.  I the way the game made me feel like I am running a dictator third world country.  We didn't finish the game as it was just taking too long.  I think If we play with half the money to start with it would make the game length to a very palatable length.  One bad thing I suspect is that, if I got picked on, I would probably have worse feelings about the game.  I don't know if the rating will go up or down from here.

This is a great game with great mechanics for its time that work well even today. However the coup part with the area control element makes the game too long and shallow each time, although for its time it could be a breakthrough. Today it just needs a super fast mechanic to handle the coup progression without having to move units around (simple bidding would be nice).

I felt like the game was designed around the theme very well, but the mechanics still came off as clunky.

A very funny game with a brilliant theme. Plays pretty smoothly for a game created in the seventies! The only problem with it is that it takes to fracking long to complete. In my first game we played for three hours and just called it quits. Looking at the money stack it would take another three hours to complete the game. Big dissapointment as I was really looking forward to enjoying this game. Instantly removed from my wishlist.

First play with 6 players was interesting, but only for the first few rounds, and the first couple coups. At the point that we started really getting into it, we suddenly realized how slow the game was going, and that we were supposed to exhaust the money deck to finish the game. after a little longer, we arbitrarily decided to end the game after two more rounds. Overall, I wasn't particularly thrilled with the game - when you get to the point that you're starting coups because there's nothing else exciting to do, you start to wonder about the wisdom of continuing. What would make me willing to play this again? For a start, a money deck of about 1/3 to (no more than) 1/2 the original size. And a few fake moustaches, hats and lots of bad, cheesy accents. I could be convinced to play it again with the right group of friendly semi-drunks who enjoy trash-talking and backstabbing with costumes. :) But even then, shorter would be better - like, beer & pretzels short, a warm-up to bigger games.

Very funny game in the diplomatic negociation mould, like Diplomacy, but with comedy value thrown in. 

Played it once & loved it, very funny. I would happily play this again.

It's a long game, but comparing this to Civilisation (a similar length) then I would rather play this every time. I would rather sand my face off than play Civilisation.

Juntu is a very unique game. It is all about the player interactions and one of the only games I know that will make even the most competitive players forget about winning first and foremost, make friends and enemies instead, and stab them (both) in the back.

The game is very dependent on group think and a general understanding of the game. The rules are sometimes not quite intuitive and the players need to understand the consequences of their actions. Most imporantly, players must be willing to do coups, so that the president changes frequently. 

Coups can take a long time (especially if players are undecided on which side they're on), and the game overall takes quite a while to finish - but it's totally worth it.

With an unofficial fan expansion (found here on BGG) it can also be played with 8-10 players. The more the merrier (messier)!

Rating based on one playing only. Junta is a long game compared to most others I play. Or at least it is with the crowd I play with, who are ruthless and cruel.

RATING: 2
Kind of a cool game, but much, much too long ... very chaotic, not a lot of control, which would be fine - but not in a 5+ hour game. This is in the class of games that if you don&#039;t get into the theme or the humor, it won&#039;t work for you at all - because, quite frankly, there is no game. There isn&#039;t any way to significantly increase your odds of winning really, so it&#039;s all about the process of gaming. This can work, but Junta is too lengthy, fiddly, and occasionally tedious to be really successful. This is a great theme that really hasn&#039;t been done well yet.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The game was fun at first, but once the cards cycled through once or twice the fun wore off a little.  The game was fun enough but just overstayed its welcome; by the end I wasn't claiming a coup just so that we wouldn't have to play through another coup phase.  A pretty dated game design.

Is there anything quite as glorious as the ceremonial shelling of the Presidential palace to mark the start of a coup or the phrase, "It has been another bad year for the Republic, my friends"? A fun mixture of negotiation and light wargaming. Should be played wearing military hats and big moustaches. A classic oldie from the era of Dune and Kingmaker that still compares well with the latest games in terms of fun though it can run long if there are too many coups. The board of West End Games latest edition is truly hideous.

On the third hand, the quality of the cards and pieces is shockingly poor.  Still, fond memories...

All BGGs may like this game, although it does take some time to play.
It has a high medium rating on the complexity scale, but has a great payoff as one of the coolest and cruelest diplomacy/wargames disguised as a regular boardgame ever published.
Definately worth "remaking". 
Added tuckboxes. Mounted dudes to all the coup pieces, added larger wooden dice, swiss bank account sleeves, model tanks, airplane, blast markers, and warship.

I don't know...the game just feels sort of clunky, like the disparate parts don't really fit together to well.  I really like the concept but both halves of the game (the political part and the wargame part) feel underdeveloped and ultimately either "too much" or "not enough" to really arrive at what it wants to be.  It's not a bad game at all, and it's something I'd really like to play more of to see if a better game emerges but as it stands, I split the difference and give it a 5 for now.

As negotiation game, it's cool to see how your friends backstab each other, including you, whether as backstabber or backstabee.

This game is fun. This game has several design problems. Junta needs to be played with a Panama Jack hat, a glass of rum, and a cigar. The mechanism of attacking for coups and making another full fledged game out of it is problematic (esp if you are the admiral - meaning you sit out most of the time) but aside from this major design issue the game makes it fun to backstab your friends (unlike diplomacy....).

Game length can be a problem if there are too many coups too. 

This is a game that every BGGer should try (they may not like but they should try)

Well, ouch. This game certainly shows some signs of it's era. It has a lot of fussy rules, some rather large "features" that don't actually feature much, and lacks, for me, a sense that it just clicks along "of a piece." I don't know how to explain it.

I really, really wanted to like this game, but it feels mostly like: Get some money. Try to hide it (avoid being assassinated). Call a Junta when you really want to go into a rather boring subgame without much interesting, or surprising tactics not already laid out on the board for you to see the end results. The *possibility* of being backstabbed and having surprise endings is there... but, not in the actuality of how the game will likely play out.

Erg.

If your group has personality and doesn't take it personally when people screw them over, this is a lot of fun.  The production values leave a lot to be desired though - very flimsy cards made out of light paper were the biggest annoyance.  I really enjoyed this though.

For me, the description on the back of the box was the best part of the game.  I was so excited to give this one a go, but that ended shortly after starting the game.  For me, games are supposed to be fun, and this one should have been right up my ally, but it fell overwhelmingly short.

Players represent various office holders in the ruling Junta. Depending upon his office and the various cards he holds, each player has a certain number of 'votes'. These are important as they must first elect a President and then vote on the budget that he proposes. Here's where it can get sticky. The President draws cards face down from the money deck (which varies in denomination from $1 to $3) and must propose a budget for the year, distributing the money as he sees fit amongst the various offices. Of course, loyalty to him is usually rewarded, while those pesky 'thorns in his side' are usually cut off completely. The beauty of all this, though, is that the President can - and most always does - keep some of the loot for himself. And since no one but he knows the value of what he drew, no one knows how much he's keeping. Suspicion is always keen. 

The goal is to amass the greatest wealth secreted away in your Swiss bank account.

It's been a long time since I played it.  I remember it being a very nasty game.  Lots of backstabbing.  Has a huge diplomatic component to it.  Do not play this game with anyone who cannot handle confrontational games.  It could cause lips to quiver.

If memory serves, there is a mechanic in the game that you can call for a revolution (if enough votes).  The strategy game then turns into a tactical wargame as the players battle it out for strategic points in the city.  The losers get the firing squad.  :)

This game is an underrated gem, combining the negotiation aspects of Diplomacy with a more freewheeling and fun to play theme and play style. It is great fun to try and influence the President to give you more cash, or as the President, attempt to give other players as little money as possible in order to secret it away in your Swiss bank account. The caveat is that I wouldn't play this game with a thin-skinned player, as betrayal and assassination are constant in this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I have to give this game credit for creativity and theme. It certainly will provide you with hours (and I mean hours) of laughs. It's not, however, a game you take seriously as the gameplay itself seems pretty unpolished. Fun occasionally, maybe twice a year, but no more. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

It's a fun game with the right people, but it's too hard to avoid falling into the same alliances when you know how other people play.

I recently got my hands on a copy of Junta in my game collection from a trade which I did with my cousin.

I have fond memories playing Junta a couple of years back.

I can't wait for this game to hit the table again. Now that I got my own copy of the game, it will hopefully get played more often. It is best with 7 players because each player has one role. Having two roles gives you too much power when there is a confict of interest with the president.

Junta is a good game with the right group people. I am happy that I got the chance to play a game recently. It was great fun with lots of laughs and backstabbing.

Although, it is not for everyone. Some similiarities with Republic of Rome. Like a water down version of it.

It's the french version from Descartes Editeur.

Intrigue, lies, assassination, negotiation, threats, backstabbing and bribes.  Pad your Swiss bank account, or keep money on hand to bribe the commander of the First Army Brigade. Don't like the deal you're getting under the current President-for-Life?  Express your displeasure with gunfire!  Kicking off a coup with a traditional bombardment of the Presidential Palace always brings a smile.  Drop your paratroops into the radio station to secure a last-turn surprise victory!

The only game I know that uses the "President's Brother-in-Law" mechanic.  [N.B. - changed (for the worse, in my opinion, to the "President's Cousin" in later versions.]

Played only once with 7 people and for about 6 hours. I enjoyed it quite a bit (maybe because my period of government was the longest of all), but it sure has some major flaws.

I was able to buy a brand new, still in shrink wrap copy of this lovely game. I really wanted the West End version because of it's look and vintage feel. The newer game looks flashy in my opinion. I like updating my games and because it breaks my heart to use the pieces from this relic, I went ahead and made new bank notes (a hobby of mine) and new Political Cards. The cards that came with the game are somewhat flimsy and small. I've scanned and used a new typeface on playing card sized cards. Perhaps I'll paint some Axis and Allies soldiers for the armies...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very good game. However, the enormous and largely irrelevant coup mechanic takes up way too much time. It seems the game can only be played if the players coup responsibly.

Update: "The public sector - c'est le moi." With some house-ruling this simple game becomes an enjoyable generator of jokes, free-wheeling dealing and backstabbing.

I used to have this at an 8, but recently moved it to a 5. I think I've only been able to play this game once, and it was a slug fest. In the end this game is a lot of unpolished chrome, too unwieldy to play often. I would say that it would make a great game to build a party around, but it's too hard to teach to non-gamers. 

I sort of wish we only played with the cards and ignored the wargame elements. 

I used to have this at an 8 but demoted it when I realized its flaws are such that I'll probably never play it. I think they made it in the 70s before they really figured out how to elegantly combine a bunch of mechanics in one game. It reminds me of Dune that way. There are so many systems to learn that don't overlap with one another too much but that really have a big impact when they do overlap. It makes it hard to teach.

Excellent game capable of taking seven players without losing impact. I have the West End Games version. The addition of some ideas from the Space Gamer magazine can extend the number of players to nine - but playabilty does go downhill. This is an old game so the change between Negotiation of the Money round into a Tactical Wargame of the Coup Attempt didn't jar so much then. I don't think this part of the game has aged well. I have played the Junta: El Presidente release. I felt that without the wargame aspect hanging over calling a coup the game did lose some enjoyable tension - so I'm on the fence about this.

Good political game. Republic of Rome kind of put this one in the shadow for me, but it's a very good game, full of bluffing and backstabbing. The Coup system could definitely be streamlined, but it's still accessible to many many people, and they're gonna have fun killing their friends and stealing their money. Main drawback is, it takes a pretty long time to see to the end. It doesn't fell like so many hours, but you still have to be able to physically make the time.

A great game that was a lot of fun, but very flawed. On the positive side, it plays a large group, there is no player elimination, and it scratches the itch for a competitive political/betrayal game like Diplomacy that is hard to scratch with other games. On the downside, it's really only playable with 6 or 7 players (and 7 is vastly superior), it can take a REALLY long time to play, and the betrayal aspect can destroy friendships.  Best played with people who are enthusiastic about it and have thick skin.

The artwork makes you think this will be a light, and light-hearted game. Then you read the wargame-style rulebook, and cry. I suppose I might summon the wherewithal one day to figure this out, but I'd rather play a historically-based wargame if I'm going to struggle with subordinated paragraphs of rules. Not sure what I feel about the treatment of the theme either, if I'm honest - feels a bit like a "cheap holiday in other peoples' misery".

Again I loathe games with hundreds of carboard squares as much as I loathe spam in my inbox. At least this game ignores them for most of it, and the El-Presidente part with a bad budget this year makes this game a must-play.

RATING: 4
Nice theme and initially exiting atmosphere, but waaay to long for what it is. Lots of problems with this one. Clumsy mechanics, needlessly complicated rules, unbalanced cards, leading-group runaway (leaves about half of the players without a chance to regain board position, with 2+ hours of game time remaining). Likely to lead to frustration and not-fun gameplay for some players.

Cancelled after 3 hours of partially interesting, partially frustrating discussions and constant checks in rulebook due to unclear mechanics, with a group of experienced gamers. Three hours in with only 30% of the game clock (money pile wich drains evenly) gone. 

Nope, won't play again without massively houseruled changes to balance and mechanics.

Played a couple turns of this before we had to quit.  Interesting ideas but very fiddly and a little tedious for such a long game.

RATING: 5
A lot of rules to learn for the first play.    Requires a few turns to get into, but is relatively easy to play once thru the motions.

May be long for some as our first game took 4 hours and we still were not done.  Too much negotiating, not enough revolutions.

Do expect a lot of randomness as the card draw might not be in your favor.  You could have 1 vote for most of the game while everyone else has 6-12.

The revolution sub-game can be interesting as people switch sides at the start, during and at the end of this part of the game.

Needs to be played with the right type of people.

The French (Edition Descartes) version has a nicer board and counters, but the cards and money are much better with the English (West End Games) edition.

There are some differences in the rules as well, such as no initial attack in the English version when an enemy unit(s) enters your sector.

Very crew-dependent, extremely time consuming politics simulation. The bandwith reaches from amazing fun to a ruined game session.

RATING: N/A
A slightly asynchronous melding of old-skool RPG and hex-n-counter wargame.  This is from back in the day when games had honest-to-god flywheels in them, and this one's got a nut welded to it.  It shudders and shimmies and makes you wince and turn your head away in anticipation of the shrapnel.

This is only going to work for you if:

• You can remember a time when games like this were "cutting edge".

• You're up on your Latin American history, poli-sci, and current events since the middle of the last century.

• You have six friends just like you.

Me, I dig it.  You may not.  Be warned.

Lives of the somewhat rich and not-so-famous in a banana republic. Junta is a game of underhanded politics as only Latin America can really do it.

A fun game that bogs down in the Coup phase, due mostly to the lack of things to do, politically, once it's begun.

Still, it's a vicious dose of treachery and deceit that begs play with the "right" group.

Played once with 4 players. Loved the diplomatic nature of the game, but it makes this a game that needs the right crowd. I was surprised by how quickly the time passed, and it played in about 2 hours with 4 players.

The political card game has aged extremely well, but the coup rules are pretty fiddly. The battles still do a great job of preserving that feel of making deals but checking your back for a knife. 

The game's main drawback are the rules. Lots of exceptions and small details to remember. 

Rating might go up if played with more people. Seems the chaos would really liven it up. 

Traded the original with a few other games for a few hundred dollars worth of Heroscape. Grabbed a newer edition from Tanga.

My main complaint is that it's way too long.  Then I'd follow the whining up with rules that beg for clarification and simplification and general fiddliness all around.  The coup is so overly complicated it's almost a whole seperate game within the game (and dumb).  However, I assume with the perfect mix of people and a MUCH shorter ending mechanism, it would be fairly fun.

...Forgot to add that the production values on the new reprint are horrendous.  That is all...

I really, really like this game, too bad it is not a good fit for all people or especially all occasions. It usually takes a very long time to play out, depending slightly on the players. Mostly though I've found that the best enjoyment from it is gleaned by playing with the assistance of copious amounts of rum and people who don't get mad too easily. 

Would like to rate it higher but having fun with this is very dependent on who you play with and occasionally how drunk you are.

RATING: 6
After 1 play.

That was really really interesting experience to play this..  This works pretty good despite it's over 30 years old.  In proper group it can be real fun, because of GREAT implementation of the theme, elements of negotiation and all these coups, assassination attempts, constantly shifting presidential and anti-presidential support etc etc..

  Nonetheless I don't desire to own it.  Don't know exactly why, but flaws I see are: too long playtime (and I rarely complain about that in games), sometimes fiddly and unclear rules, the optimum number of players is 7.  I can imagine it can be somewhat difficult to gather people to play this one.

Very language dependent - play only in 'friendly' language.

Cool cards, bizarre conversations, horrible accents, frequent laughter, backstabbing without too much bitterness.

Good fun, every once in awhile.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (October 2010)

Junta is a very good game. Lots of fun with lots of negotiation and backstabbing. What else do you need :D. 

On a more serious note, you need at least 5 players to truly enjoy the game (less than that and the game is not as fun), also the wrong people can kill the fun (play ONLY with players that can take a good backstabbing not with the ones that take the game too seriously)

The game can consume a lot of time but it is absolutely worthy.

The rating just went up because the first time I played Junta there where a lot of missing rules (coup, presidential resignation, exile, brother in law). Now is a 9.0 to me.

In conclusion I recommend Junta but only if you can get the right group to play it.

Current Rating: 9.0

It’s been years since I last played Junta! In theory I still like the game but in practice, my gaming tastes have changed a lot these years.

In general, I no longer enjoy “take that” games and long games need to be much more engaging to keep me playing them.

Junta was a great game to start playing some years ago, but I no longer enjoy it so I’m downgrading its rating. I also sold my copy of the game.

The proverbial curate's egg. Great fun once you've learned the concepts, but a bit long and complex for a 'fun' game to play with a casual crowd. At the same time, probably a bit too anarchic for the Civilisation fans who have the time to invest in playing it. Worth persevering with.

The best part of the game is the money distribution phase, &quot;Senors, the gringos have been bery bery stingy this year. . .&quot; &lt;said with an extremely cheesy South American accent&gt;.

RATING: 4
I haven't played in years, but this game is a prime example of why I now play Euros.  Unless you are involved there is too much diplomacy, which means too much down time, and game play is much, much too long.  20 years ago, when I had more patience, this was OK once in a while... now it's just plain tedious.

Fun the first time you play, but less fun each game thereafter.  After one play rate it a 6... after many it's only a 4.

Around 1990 I used to play this a lot with my high school buddies. We simply loved it up to a degree that my copy is still missing a few money bills that one of my group must have taken with him to prepare for the next game. Then, life came and gaming took a backseat. 

It took 25 years until a replay. I'm a dyed-in-the-wool eurogamer by now, so I was prepared for not liking it much anymore. Fortunately, the play wasn't the letdown I was afraid of. I had fun, I even won. But all the weaknesses of the game are obvious. It's an experience game with a mere framework of rules to play out the experience. To be enjoyable, players need to fill this framework with interaction. Players have to take up the roles of politicians in a banana republic, act accordingly, bribe, promise, lie, mostly even stand to their promises. This is the prerequisite. Then, cards, luck and goodwill have to subject to a normal distribution to warrant an enjoyable game for everybody. Otherwise, time can - and probably will for one or more players - come to a standstill when there's not much to be done. Negotiation skills are important in these situations but not the cure-all.

I wouldn't mind playing it again. Not this year, probably not the next year but maybe earlier than another 25 years from now. Finding 7 players willing to invest 5-6 hours into a negotiation game won't be easy anyway. Come to think of it, this is exactly what Diplomacy requires which is a superior, deeper no-luck design. The required groups for playing out successful are astonishingly different with only a partial overlap.

I can have fun with this game when in the mood and have the right group. Don't take it too seriously and let it drag on longer than it should. I love the coup phase and imagining how what unfolds on the board might look like on CNN: "In today's foreign news, Air Marshall Joe ordered air strikes on anti-government student demonstrators in University City. It has been 3 days since General Bob moved the 2nd Army into these middle-class neighborhoods to prepare for an assualt on the presidential palace. Admiral Ken landed marines in the dockyards and is trying to reclaim the radio station which has recently been taken over by pro-junta police troops..."

While this is one of my favorite games, it falls in the category of games that depend on the group you play with.  I&#039;ve played this a number of times, mostly with a group who doesn&#039;t take backstabbing personally, and really gets into the theme.  I think the theme and mechanicas are well suited - both gloriously reek of the 80s.  I would suggest playing before you buy.  But I hope you enjoy it.

RATING: 8.3
Fun game, but the rules are badly written and the component quality is poor (West End Games). If you can get over that, it is thoroughly enjoyable  being the head of a conniving, scheming political family in a corrupt banana republic. 7.5

Update: New AEG version sooo much better quality and artwork. Long game, but if you have the right large group, a day to spend, this game is pure theatre at it's best and so many laughs and back stabbings. New rating 8.3

Not funny, takes ages to play, but at least there's a small amount of skill involved.

Playing with different groups can be amazingly different though. Some people seem to consider it quite usual for the president to keep half the money, others will stage a coup is the president keeps more than a single bill.

The most fun is had when people from the above two groups play together. Not very *much* fun, though.

RATING: 4
Quite a good game, but a bit too long for my tastes and the length is not created by smart gameplay, but rather by weak mechanisms. There shouldn't be so much money available -> less money would mean less rounds, and the event card deck should be a bit tighter. The semi-wargaming that happens when couping, however, is clearly the weakest point of the game. It takes a lot of time and could surely be resolved in a smarter way. Someone should actually create a pure card or express version of Junta, even though Citadels is in a way Junta packed into 30-45 minutes. At least when you get assassinated a lot, the feelings are somewhat same, but with Junta it just lasts way longer until you get the chance for rematch.

Junta is a fun and, at times, quite silly game of constant backstabbing. You can raise a coup d'etat and contract killers with one single objective: take possession of your opponents' money. So yes, it's a game of being mean, but in a fun way.

In junta players form the government of a banana republic. The objective isn't to actually rule the country, but to steal as much money from it as you can. A key mechanism is, whenever you die, you loose all the money you have in your hands. In order for it to be accounted, you need to make it to the bank, to deposit it in your Swiss bank account.

Each turn, the president proposes how to distribute the foreign aid, on which the rest of the players vote. But what if you disagree? What if the voting passed and you didn't liked its outcome? Coup! Another player received more money than you? Coup! But what if you don't feel like starting a coup? Coup! I mean, assassin! It's a game of negotiation and backstabbing, yes, but the atmosphere is so chaotic that you don't feel much like being betrayed: it's simply the natural course.

A coup d'etat starts a mini war game in which players take sides for either the president or the rebels. Don't think about it much though: you can change sides at almost any time. Players are given a certain amount of troops, depending on their office, and must take control of certain strategical locations. The side who controls the most locations wins, moment in which its respective leader chooses someone to be shot. Then the leader may share the loot if he feels [-]keeping all the money would be greedy[/-] he won't make it to the bank without creating a couple of extra targets.

The game's main flaw is its downtime. The game doesn't reward careful planning, it rewards constant backstabbing. Think too much and other players will think you are up to something, thus other players will want to kill you. Thinking is counter productive. The key is making temporary alliances, not planning a master move.

The game is, at heart, chaotic. If a player fails to accept and embrace its nature, it can ruin its pace. This can be particularly troublesome during coups, where combat is really random and, in the end, it depends on whom sides with whom. Troop positioning is not all that important important: whom wants to backstab whom is.

Basically, this is Junta. The rules are a bit clunky to explain, but very thematic, so you just need to see how a round in action to understand its flow of play. The game's core is so mean spirited the atmosphere is much more relaxed than in other betrayal-prone games. When everyone is constantly at each other's throats, when alliances last mere minutes, betrayals stop feeling personal and become stupidly hilarious.

I liked my play of junta. but it is a game if I had it in my collection would only be played by the lack of games that plays 6. 
in the game i was made president. after 8 or 9 rounds I set myself up to be assasinated. probably too late. The pie divide mechanic. works well. probably too few assasins in the game though.

this somehow reminds me of cash and gums with the latter being a really simplified version.

I think the main problem with this game it that it's old and it would need a face lift. The problem is that the new junta game does not replace this game at all.

The ideas and the theme behind this game is awesome, it's just the implementation which is very unelegant. The worst part if the wargame during a coup that almost double the length of the game, so you want to make sure you have few coup d'etat in the game.

Also some cards are very weak or almost useless. I got a couple of cards where I never see a situation where I could use them. So cards even asked for other cards to be present in play to be usable.

A complete remake could be necessary. There seems to be a homemade card edition of this game which replace the war part of the game with something else. I have not tried it but it will surely run more smoothly.

Also for the role cards, they all seems to be always the same except for the minister of the interior. I would have loved that each character had a special power of it's own rather than simply controlling different military forces.

This game is great on theme alone.  Rules are problematic, though.

Picked this up at the ConQuest '04 flea market for an amazing $10! Even better was finding out it had never been played and was unpunched!!

As far as the game goes, it is lots of fun, BUT is way too long for the payoff. I think that removing 24 random bills (3 turns worth) from the stack would make this a much better game and make it more playable as there isnt a whole lot impacted by having 3 fewer turns.

A good game.  I partially like it because I haven't found a game that does what it attempts to do better.  Could it be improved?  Probably; it has a lot of issues with seating order, drawing certain cards (donation cards being extremely powerful in many player games.  I enjoy it and find it to be a tense game, but I more than understand those that don't like it.

The system certainly has some flaws. Despite the convoluted rules, at first it seems that there is no game at all. Then you realize that in this case not the rules define the game but the players do. If you play thinking that the game can be won the "usual way", by making smart decisions based in a strategical or tactical manner on the rules, you surely will be disappointed. The game will become extremely tedious, because those gamers will cling to the only portion that is more or less exhaustively spelled out in the rules (the mini coup d'etat wargame) and start one revolution after another. This game is all about storytelling (as indicated by Eric "Arabian Nights" Goldberg as co-designer). If players don't get this, it can feel very repetitive. This definitely is not a good game to play with strangers. There are many complaints about the length, some folks seem to play up to 8 hours! None of my games lasted longer than 3 hours, though.

This game is alright and it can get hilariuos with the right people. A lot of luck with the cards can make for a dull play. Also the coup phase can take so long that players will avoid it when they can. Eitehr way, its good to be the president.

The game length really depends on how many coups are formed.  A wheeling-dealing negotiation game which, for me, has lost some of its appeal over time.

RATING: 6
The seminal neo-realist ironic board game of embesseling tax money and ruining a banana republic. Consists of two game modes where the first--election and voting--is fast and fun, and the second--revolution--is a strategy game inspired of 1970's Avalon Hill products of paper chits and movements, and is a drag. 

Though the game is thematically entertaining and spot-on in its social commentary of the world and the post-Cuba Crisis era leading up to such geo-political highlights such as the Reagain foreign politics and Oliver North Iran-Contras shenanigans and covers all the esential core morsels (incredible embesselmensts of public funds, fast and furious allegiance switching, backstabbing negotiations, nepotism, presidents taking asylum in foreign embassies with all the swindled-away money, etc) it also shows its age and period with loooots of rules and exceptions, and incongruent and "realism"-over-streamline game modes.

Featuring ghastly down times for players unfortunate at the card draws or assassinated just before a revolution (which is a very common situation), the game is a time-sink that fast lose appeal when the player gets over the initial enthusiasm over the brilliantly executed sarcasm. However, it also is a quite unique and rich game that promises a great deal of fun for players that can overcome the title's many speed bumps.

New in collection feb 2008

Initial rating after 1 play with seven:

This is a game with some rough edges, but with bucketloads of atmosphere. After one play it's clear why this is a classic, and at the same time I understand the naysayers (some clunky things, some rules lawyering). But I think the naysayers are either boring old farts, or got struck by onreasonable amounts of bad luck...

If you're in for a game with perfect rules and even chances, look somewhere else. 

If you're in for a game with tons of atmosphere, excitement and the right amount of backstabbing, look no further! (yes, I usually like perfectly balanced Eurogames)

More of a social event than a game, really, because it's hard to win and after a while you don't care whether you do. But it is a nice concept well-executed, it is fun, and you will laugh your butt off as you stab your friends in the back and get stabbed in return. Not great, but a solid night's entertainment. Games with lots of diplomacy and negotiation usually suck hard. But this game gets it right--make it funny, make it bloody and make it laugh-out-loud fun.

An Ameritrash classic.  Game mechanics mesh well with the theme.

Would still like to play again though.

Was nervous that like many out of print games from the mid-80's, it would take six hours to play - however, a variant allowed the game to finish in under three hours, and they were three hours of laughing, booing, cursing, bluffing, negotiating, manipulating and backstabbing. This is a damn fine game, lathered with a theme that is just dirty enough to be satirical, but not enough satire (like War on Terror) that it stops being a game.
----------------------
Later games of this have demonstrated just how horribly broken this game can be - too much potential for a runaway leader, not enough real BALANCE, and very little that can be done about it. Normally imbalance and chaos are my thing, but this game takes about four or five hours, so that imbalance and chaos becomes tedium after the first hour.

In the latest West End edition, the quality of the counters leaves a lot to be desired.  However, with the full complement of 7 players, this game is entertaining, albeit long.  With the "sub-game" of the coup, this game is like a tasty morsel of political negotiation, sprinkled with treachery with a soft, chewy "area-control wargame" in its center.  Well done.

Played this quite a bit in the early 90s. It was a well-realised concept. There was plenty of fun from the continual dealing and double-dealing. The secret money allocation and visits to the bank were excellent mechanics. I remember each session running for about 30-60 minutes past the point of everyone's interest in the outcome had long expired, though. The coup mini-wargame was a bit too random but the idea of coup participants getting rewards through seats in the new government was a great idea. A new, simpler combat system would be a good idea.

Excellent good clean fun!

I want so badly to like this game.  But it always turned into a formulaic shell game.  President hogs budget / is he at the bank this turn?  Time for the bi-turnly coup, where the outcome is all but pre-ordained from the outset.  Hours later, the game finally ends.

But then, I never got to play with more than 4 players.

2-7 players, best 6-7

Fun game of Banana Republic politics, if you can find the right 6-7 cutthroat gamers to play with you! And that's its main problem, finding enough of the right players. The second problem is its length at 4+ hours. But other than that, it's a unique game. I urge you to read more about it on its BGG page.

Big pro: All players remain in contention to the very end, for no one knows who has managed to smuggle (and retain) the most money into their Swiss bank account!

Note sure how to rate this, since it has been a while since I last played this game. So... is it still as excellent as I remember it? Hmmmm.

Note:
[thing=84159][/thing] is supposedly a lite version of the original [thing=242][/thing]. Appears to be very much changed, not near the same game. The goal/victory condition is quite different (no more embezzling money to your swiss account). There is no city map, which had been used during a putsch attempt. Are there even influence cards in it?  Have not played it to be able to give a rating, but I am very doubtful that it can capture the original´s experience.

2-7 players, best 6-7

Fun game of Banana Republic politics, if you can find the right 6-7 cutthroat gamers to play with you! And that's its main problem, finding enough of the right players. The second problem is its length at 4+ hours. But other than that, it's a unique game. I urge you to read more about it on its BGG page.

Big pro: All players remain in contention to the very end, for no one knows who has managed to smuggle (and retain) the most money into their Swiss bank account!

This 2015 edition has:
Bigger map, some component changes, and a few rule changes (for example, Exile and Combat) have been made to improve the game play.

Do we now have the Ultimate Edition? Hm. Some things may be better than the 1985 German Edition, and some less.  I prefer a more readable map, the original family symbols, and the Cold War era setting. However, it's a good quality version of the game and should not deter anyone from purchase.

Junta is one of those rare games that shine best with the full complement of 7 players!

Great game for min 5 players (to which rating applies). My version now christened "Travel Junta" as the pieces stick to the board since beer was spilled over it. Beer - that gives away what sort of game it is. Not too long when we played it despite others comments, although Coup rules could be slicked up. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It can be hard to get 7 people together for a 3 - 4 hour board game (is it only us that takes this long to play this one?), but Junta is great fun if you can manage it. It does take a certain type of player to work - you need people willing to take risks and rock the boat, and to recognise when they're getting a raw deal.

Gioco simpatico e divertente ma eccessivamente lungo soprattutto se si analizza il fatto che il caso (la pesca delle carte) esercita un ruolo predominanti sulle sorti della partita. I tradimenti, i bluff, gli assassigni rendono il gioco comunque frizzante ma la mancanza di qualche elemento in più strategico mi fanno storcere il naso. Trovo che il gioco faccia un po' troppo vedere i suoi anni.

RATING: 7
Fun "negotiation" (ha!) game, with lots of backstabbing and intrigue. Needs 6-7. Wargame aspect is dated but OK, can be a bit of a dice-fest. Some of the political cards are hilarious, in a cynical way.
It /does/ take a long time to play though - I recommend the variant where 4 notes are removed from the money deck after each coup attempt.

[Rating for Junta applying the tweaks explained below: 8]

A great game with great problems. It has a striking sense of humor and sarcasm, a nice and light combat system, a lot of interaction, backstabbing and cooperation. That's where it shines.  BUT - let's get down to the main problem! If you play this game by the official rules, for roughly half of the very long play time (expect 8 hours with 6 or 7 players), it's actually a repetitive and uninteresting mini-wargame.

NECESSARY TWEAKS: You don't need more than 4 or 5 coups for the whole game, believe me. Apply a house rule for coup restriction, otherwise you'll have a coup in every single round, which slows down the flow of the game to an annoying degree and makes it last for 7 hours and more. For example:
- define 2 coup excuses as a requirement for 1 coup. 
- Speed up the game by drawing more bank notes than the usual, or reduce the size of the development aid pile from the beginning.
- The president is obligued to grant each player at minimum one banknote.

The theme is fun. Its an experience game you play for the ride. For a group of wheeler-dealer, role-playing negotiators its probably a great game, and I certainly enjoyed the opportunities it raised to have a lot of fun with the role. But there are a few issues which take the gloss off.

The rules. 45 minutes. Unnecessary chrome. Lots of fiddly rules which don't add much and are hard to remember (now the bank is closed for lunch right, or has it shut down for the turn?). Luck. You can be the best wheeler-dealer in the group and understand the dynamics of the game perfectly. But if you get no influence cards, no 'donation' cards and get shafted in the budget; or you go along with a coup and can't roll a 6 (a death) for your life; or you get to be president 'for life' and you collect 7 1's and a 2; well, you're not going to fare that well.

The crux of it that there were never many interesting decisions. You voted for the right person or not, and even then, you're at his whim. Ok, what can I say to get more of the split. Now, am I a likely target for an assasination. Nope. Go to the bank. Yep. Go somewhere else. Am I getting less money than others? Yep, start a coup. Nope. Let the good times roll.

The game within the game - the coup - seems completely in contrast to the rest of the game. This may be the ultimate time-wasting chrome, but for some it was the game's best feature. For me, it was, ok, the game stops, here's another 20 minutes of pushing counters in a half-cocked simplistic counter-pushing wargame where the whims of fate and player whimsy eventually decide that the president lives, nothing changes ... or the coup succeeds, ok there's a new president. Surely there's a cleaner, faster, smarter, funner way to do this?

Good for the occasional role-playing 'ride' however and people who like negotiation / theme / luck will score it higher.

I get to be a leading family in a small nation with the goal of stealing as much government money as I can while either overthrowing that government or trying to avoid getting killed?  Great!

Junta has a very strong theme and some fun mechanics to back it up.  It indulges our worst personality aspects in a humorous way, and provides for diplomacy, strategy, and tactics all at once.  It can be amazingly fun to roll through.

However, it's too long for what it is, particularly if you've got a group that loves launching coups.  The game can simply bog down into endless rounds of coups and combat, which really detracts from the fun that you can have.  And there's no real way to avoid this problem.  And if you aren't among the ruling elite, there's relatively little reason not to contemplate a frequent coup because you've got relatively little to lose.

Fun ideas, silly mechanics, and good game that can just take too long.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
ALWAYS play this game with at least 5 players, preferably 7.

NEVER play this game with people who are sensitive or will take offensive to being stabbed in the back, betrayed or otherwise treated unfairly.

An excellent game and one which I dearly love. Excellent memories of my reign as President being brought short when I orchestrated my own First General to coup against me and have my Minister of Internal Security shot, then vote me straight back in as President again and become the new Minister of Interal Security.

Not so good memories of my wife almost deciding to divorce me after I launched a coup to make her President and then had her shot from my position of Minister of Internal Security the very next turn...

As I said, be careful who you play with.

Adoro i giochi che nelle regole dicono che non ci sono regole. Certi boardgame invitano a farlo in alcune fasi di gioco, in Junta puoi (devi?) farlo quasi sempre. La "mutanda di bandone" è d'obbligo e non basta, e in alcune fasi il tuo trasformismo può farti schifo. Non è un capolavoro (e la grafica non è all'altezza), ma ti immedesimi come in un gioco di ruolo, litighi come in un gioco di comitato e ti diverti come in un party game. Devi però farlo con i giocatori giusti. Ci sono giochi che valuti per le meccaniche e i componenti. Poi ci sono giochi come Junta, il cui voto dipende dalle persone con cui l'hai giocato: si può dare un voto basso?

A game from the previous generation, where flavor, conflict, and interaction over more than 2 hours were the call for the day.  Having played once, not knowing the card distribution is frustrating, and I believe a player aid is needed to keep track of the votes.

Each player represents a family in a fictional Cuba-esque country. One is elected President, the others are appointed posts in the government, largely responsible for elements of the military. Everyone tries to amass money in their secret bank accounts, killing off opponents if they feel someone else is being more successful or to try to land the Presidency for their own family. Good fun, a little fiddly, and full of back stabby fun.

It has a narrow margin as far as players are concerned - I don't bother unless there are exactly 7.  But when that magic 7 sit down to play it is one of the finest games around.  Alliances build and fall throughout, your closest ally becomes your most despised turncoat and then back again later in the game.  But you NEVER forget a slight and your knives are sharp for when those who crossed you present their back.  Possibly the most fun board game going, play it with friends.

I love negotigation games.

Things I love:
* I usually hate games with special action cards, but since these cards can't be hoarded, and they can be traded, I don't mind at all
* Mechanisms that enable, and encourage, players to bash the leader
* Mechanisms that allow players to swich alliances without resorting to secret, simutaneous moves. It is so satisfying to switch alliances right after a hard-fought coup!

Things I don't like so much
* The crap shoot feeling when it comes to attempting assasinations. I wish the other four locations had more significance in the game
* Although enjoyable (unless you have been assassinated), coups take too long!

this is a hard game to rate. on the one hand the theme is great, and there is a high level of player interaction. on the other hand, you don't have a lot of control over your fate, and this is one of those games that is totally group dependent. in that way, i can't really recommend this game, over other sleeker and better negotiation games, namely mall of horror or traders of genoa. but even though this game lasts way too long for what the game itself offers, with the right group at the right time, every once in a blue moon, this game offers lots of laughs. somebody desperately needs to streamline this game.

I did not play a complete game of Junta.  I will not ever play a complete game of Junta.  I could see that there were some interesting things going on in the game.  I just felt so unpleasant stabbing people in the back and being a big jerk!  The whole point of Junta is to fight with people, and if I wanted to fight with someone, I could start talking to my mother.

The negotiating, bluffing and voting is great. Staring a coup is interesting, but tends to lengthen the game way too much. What could be an amazing filler game, turns into a stressful and mean long game. With the wrong group, it could easily outstay it's welcome.

Certainly recommend this in large enough group, I.e. 5+, as otherwise the deception, role distribution etc... doesn’t work as well.

Would say it’s a 7 with four players. 2-3 shouldn’t bother, in my opinion.

RATING: 6
Unique and very fun game marred only by the wargame-style and confusing "Coup" rules, which extend play time a bit more than the fun might last. For that reason alone, it gets to the table less often with my group. Word of advice for the politically-correct-minded: try before you buy. This has "stereotype" written all over it.

One of the Best 6 player games out there IMO, letting ONE general also get Navy. (instead of 7 player)

RATING: 7
The biggest problem is that it takes 7 players to play properly. Less than that, and you start doubling up positions; more than that and some are left out of the government. Neither is good.

Beyond that problem, it is a very good, fun, funny game.

RATING: 3
Too much negotiation for my taste. I like economic negotiation, like in Bohnanza, but this completely free for all wheeling and dealing is just exhausting. This is combined with the game being too long (we have played a short version, which already overstayed its welcome). This combined with cards of vastly different effectiveness makes not a fun game.

RATING: 9
An all time classic, that brings out the most insidious traits in people - even in people that you didn't think had them! Junta is very well thought out conceptually and I love the cynical humor of the game as well: assasinations left and right, mistress as a location, student riots without much fighting strength, admirals that have a measely boat - and the rules that explicitly state, not to behave in this way in real life. In particular, recently I played Junta with group of people of the wut?!-you-can-play-a-game-made-of-card-stock-and-dice-everything-was-computer-based-when-I-was-kid generation (early twenties) - and after I had finished the ceremonial "the banana harvest has been tragically poor this year" speech, just after drawing the budget (an element I *did* remember from playing Junta as a teen in the 80's), they all *spontaneously*, with no prior instruction of any sort, broke out in a caccophony of "but we need new uniforms/tanks/bullets/the brass band needs new horns" (another regular of the game, that I had completely forgotten about) - I almost couldn't speak from laughing! :D A simple game rulewise, yet the negotiation/backstab component makes it ever unpredictable and entertaining!

I've played this once, way back in 2012 - it being chosen only because it was the only one available on our once-a-month all-day games day to accommodate 7. I can't say I didn't have some fun, but I will probably never want to play this more than once a year. I saw more or less no strategy when people are choosing more or less at random whether to start/join a coup or not (we had a coup every single turn...), not to mention that it's essentially random whether you survive when the time inevitably comes where you need to risk going to the bank. While fun in a silly kind of way, I really don't think that kind of game should go on for 6 hours...

An excellent game.  Fun, bluffing, and backstabbing.  I have the original version of the game with cards that are not as nice as the later version, but with a map that I believe is far superior in overall look.  The new map seems too gaudy and too much color contrast.

some really neat mechanics and politics, but with too many irrelevant rules that lengthen but do not improve the game. If you play in the spirit of the game, it's great.  But if you actually play strategically and optimally, it really drags (e.g. routine civil wars that have little consequence).

2-7 players.Pass the beer and pretzels. This is  a distinctly non PC game representing the backstabbing rise and fall of power players in a fictional banana republic. 

Rules mechanics are a little fiddly though easy to learn. Politics, assassinations and double dealing are the keys to getting the most money in your Swiss account before the game ends.

Downside is that a player can be frozen out of the game for several turns by a dedicated power block. The map and pieces are also very cheap looking but, that's part fo the theme.

I like Junta.  Put a pitcher of daiquiris on the table and it gets even better.  My buddy Paul got his "running will merely postpone your traitorous death" tag-line by playing this, and that gives you an idea of how the game goes.

"Ok with the right crowd" applies to this game, but not the way you think -- this game needs individuals qualified to run third-world countries to play well.  Don't stop by the 18XX table looking for players.

I think this a provisional rating because I expect this game will differ greatly on how it's played. The game I played was quite flat with minimal wheeler dealing. However by all accounts the previous game my group had was full of schemeing and backstabbing and was a riot. 

The only thing I didn't like about the game was the rolling straight sixes to hit in the coup phase. Just a personal bugbear of mine.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This unique game of corruption and treachery is one of my favs. The game play fits the theme very well, with players obsequiously siding up with El Presidente, or becoming outcasts who plot their eventual revenge. Then you get to do a little wargaming for extra fun.

The last time I played was around 2004, with a bunch of newbies. I became El Presidente and then whipped out some high vote support cards and dominated the budget process. Before the other players had figured out what was happening I had my victory secured!

RATING: 10
An all time classic. Brilliantly, cynically funny - the concept of trying to funnel the most foreign aid money into your Swiss bank account is probably depressingly accurate. The only game I know where you shuffle the money at the start. Republished a number of times in different versions, it's a game that cries out for a definitive version and rule-set - I'd love to see GMT or similar give it the deluxe treatment it merits. Contains the funniest card ever issued in a boardgame (IMHO) - "Students issue petition condemning repression - No Effect"(!)

After a recent play I have to update this to 10. Played the latest AEG version -  full 7 player - everyone had an appropriate hat for their role, and everyone LOVED the experience. You need the right group to play this - don't approach it as a thinky strategy game - just set out to get into the role, make political speeches, protest about backstabbing and disloyalty - and enjoy the experience and the laughter.

As a strategy game I'd probably rate it 4 or 5. As a fun experience, this has to be a 10.

An 8 - but only in the CWW Original version (1978)!

All later editions pretend to be the same, but that's not true. They added tons of event cards, added tons of money, added horrible colours that hurt the eye, took out strategy and tactics. Some game mechanics of the original version won't function anymore with that flood of money and assassinations.

105 bucks - 15 for each player in a seven player game.
And with the reduced amount of political cards, the minister's position is very special. He is the one to decide, who is to live and who's to die. Not everybody shooting around and killing everyone in sight. 

A 5 for second edition, a 2 for third. Please - never ever make a fourth.

One of those games I squezeed till the last drop of fun. 7 players, all rum drinkers, all smokers, all with broad knowledge in south america politics... That was the perfect atmosphere. I must confess, I miss those "junta-nights"...

RATING: 7
As with many games, this is enjoyable only when played with the right group. Do not play this with grudgebearers, sulkers and people who avoid risks. Also, the more players, the better.

However, gameplay is repetitive (as there are not that many action cards) and finishing finishing in under two hours simply not possible - rather, five hours seems to be more realistic.

RATING: 7
This got a few plays back in the day and I remember it being great fun. I pulled it off the shelf recently, considered introducing it to a group of non-gamers. When I looked at the rules, I thought Cosmic Encounter might be a better bet. I’d still like to dust this game off, but it will have to be with a dedicated group of gamers.

Awesome game, if combined with one part beer, one part roleplaying and one part sense of humour for each player. A little wacky and also the coups are slightly too time consuming for Junta to be a really great game.

This freewheeling, double-dealing and card-stealing (sorry) game has some serious issues. After playing it a few times, I'm thinking there may actually be some subtlety to it.
By far the most political (in the sense of politics) game I've ever played. 
This is one of those games in which the game itself is the fun, not the winning per se. If the idea of bad accents and goofy fun appeal to you, look at this game.

An old-school multiplayer conflict game for sure.  Cross Diplomacy and Cosmic Encounter, and throw in a lot of angry chaos, and this is what you get.  Great all-day game for those who don't mind a game that not only allows, not only invites, but MANDATES backstabbing!

I really don't enjoy this game.  It has everything I dislike in a game, bidding, backstabbing, diplomacy, and on my part an general failure to understand and see the point.

Fun social negotiation game with backstabbing. The coup phase is too long and somewhat rules heavy/confusing. This game also takes a lot of time.

This, to me, is how you make a diplomacy style game.  This game tricks you into thinking its a political war game, but that is simply not the case.  The economic card hoarding alliance forming friendship mourning that is junta should be tried by many.  Only complaint is the same gameplay is played over and over with little change, making longer games drag a tad.  High recommendation from me

A game which, if you can find 6 other idiots, is superb fun. Every year, you quickly learn, is a bad year for foreign aid - cue endless Spaghetti Western eye-narrowing across the table and mutterings of dissent...

All too rarely played nowadays, sadly, but still one of my favourites, with treachery and cod accents aplenty.

Let down slightly by the crap playing pieces and the length of the inevitable coups, but at heart a sly, slick, funny game of intrigue, double-dealing and summary executions.

I really must talk my lot into another game soon...

Junta ONLY merits a nine if ALL PLAYERS speak in bad accents.  The accents do not all have to be spanish.   They can be Irish, German, Indian, whatever.  They just have to be bad.  Without accents, this game goes to a three or four.

The theme is unbeatable, and this is one of those games that everybody should play at least once.  However, I find the strategic interest isn't deep enough to survive the game's length, especially in "coup happy" games.

RATING: 7
A truly FUN game.  Backstabbing?  Eh only a little...that is if you call a little heavy doses of it every single round!  Evil...in a box. Weak point is the coup system which drags and if you play with someone who coups every round...it can make the game itself drag...stay focused keep the players in the game and moving their chits during the coup and it's not too bad. Some very quirky differences between 2nd and 3rd edition, I've played 2nd and own 3rd so I'm still working out all the ins and outs with those.

With the right 5-7 players, this can be fun.

However, it's long and the coups are just not interesting enough.  IMO, the coup sequence could and should be greatly streamlined, capturing 90% of the play value in 30% of the time... allowing players to concentrate on the other, more interesting and fun parts of the game.

Brilliant idea and some great mechanics.  The money allocation technique has now passed into popular conversation in my circle, viz "How's business?"  "Ooh, it's been a very bad year, no 3s at all...".  But it is far too easy to get a coup excuse, which means there are far too many coups, which means it is just Too Damn Long.  Pity.

One of the longest games I thoroughly enjoy.  Essentially a so-so negotiation game at its core, but the potential for wild accusations, the theme, and other elements combine to form a game that's just fun.


I'll note that I played this back in 2008 - I imagine the bad aspects of this game would wear on me a lot more nowadays.  It's overly long, combat is drawn out and doesn't have interesting decisions, etc.  Still, I remember the core negotiation driven by the theme fondly.

This rating is almost certainly too low, but I had only one session of this, but it was enough to poison my group and I against it forever.  I don't ever want to play this again.  It's got a high dose of randomness, and can be broken by players that don't play within the spirit of the game, such that it just becomes a horrible slog to the end game as the players on the outside just get more and more frustrated.  It's [gameid=1513] if the game was degenerate and broken.

Unfortunately I half-played this game only once in the early 90th. The session ended in a disaster and killed a year-long friendship. Until this sudden death of our gaming day I had a lot of fun, since the game has a very interactive and unique diplomacy system.

I have never bought it though, because it seems impossible to find enough people who like to join in. And each year again in Essen I look at it and suppress the urge to spend my money on a game I will probably never have a chance to play. :-)

RATING: 4
Perfectly fine for some people, but not for me.  It can't decide whether to be a politicking game or a wargame.  Voting generally attracts predictable block votes, and the occassional coup swerves the game into a slow and clunky mini wargame compared to the politicking.  The price of failure is often too high and the rewards of victory too precarious.  There's almost always a better game depending on what you're after.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A masterpiece.  Greatly captures its theme and owns it very well.  There is luck and randomness involved, but the sheer enjoyment of playing El Presidente of a Banana Republic with all 6 other players possibly out to get you is unrivaled.  Only reason it is rated an 8 instead of higher is the extreme downtime and how the game can drag if Coup D'etats are happening every turn!

This, like Diplomacy, is a blast with the right group and miserable with the wrong one. Also like Diplomacy, it's probably too long for what it is.

It makes for a really enjoyable experience, if not one that I typically game for.

Assassinate the president! Lead a column of rioters against army loyalists entrechened in the radio station! Line up people against a wall and shoot them! Win freinds and influence people or just give a huge bribe to the secret police to keep the people sweet!
A fun (ifn complicated) game of political wheeler-dealing in an incredibly corrupt banana republic, plenty of chances for back stabbing and staying in power by any means possible, may very well cause fights with volatile people, play is mostly by cards but when all else fails and the tanks roll action switches to a small war game (with simplistic rules) centered around the capital of the country. I have heard a  rumour a re-release is imminent but can in no way back this up with fact, well worth hunting down anyway!

Simply one of the very best multiplayer titles around, a blast to play, and a proper mindset can make it even more entertaining than the rules alone make it. The ritual naval shelling & airforce bombing of the palace during the coup is always a treat. Ultimately though the really best time is had if you can get into character as a power in a banana republic as you try to line your swiss bank account.

A game about running a Banana Republic with a little board wargame in the middle (to resolve coups). Great fun with the right people.

I like the politcal part of this game but the coup part of it was not great.  The one time we played one player got assassinated just before a coup began and he had to wait for an hour and half for the coup to be resolved, with nothing to do.  I'd try this game again with a different mix of people but it didn't work for me in the pst.

Fun if you can play it in the spirit intended.  Free your inner corrupt dictator.  Everyone has to be on board and too much "seriousness" will hurt the game.

Makes me long for an online version of this game, to handle all of the bit management.  Long game for its depth, but can lead to amusing player interactions (Beretta Berettina's sangfroid in the face of imminent assassination).  "So.  It is time to die.  I will smoke my last cigarette, and then I vill keell myself rather than let you eliminate me.  Oh crap.  I missed."

Für mich ist Junta gerade in einer größeren Runde ab etwas 4 Spielern echt unterhaltsam. Die Spielidee ist klasse und garantiert den ein oder anderen Lacher der Partie. Teilweise kann das Spiel echt lange dauern.

(Trade Interest: medium) good political game surrounded by okay war game.  i like the part about convincing others to go your way, but then i'm not very good at stuffing away the money, so i don't like that too.  the war game part is alright, but takes too long.  all that said, it does evoke the theme rather well, and that for me is the most important part of a game.

The theme is funny, but this game really drags, especially during a coup. Our group usually quits before the true end of the game (5+ hours?)

RATING: 2.5
Shows it's age. Really overwrought game time for the experience it offers, it is not worth the time investment at all. The card play is a crapshoot - so few meaningful choices to be made. The most interesting part of the game is choosing which location to go to and, if you have the ability to assassinate, who to target and trying to guess where they are. The whole combat portion of the game is a bore and could be resolved in a fraction of the time. This game is a relic that I have no nostalgia for.

This is one of those games where the memories are better than the actual gameplay. Could take ages, and if a player didn't understand the subtleties of the game, or was just overly aggressive, then a coup on every turn made the game near unplayable.

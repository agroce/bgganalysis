RATING: 8
A wonderful game with a simple play mechanism and essentially just two options each turn: shall I place a  worker (die) on a city tile to build it, or onto a built city tile to activate it?

Initially with only a few tiles out and only 3 inexperienced (low pip value) workers per player the choices are few and straightforward;  but as the game progresses and more and more tiles are added to the city, your choices grow and become increasingly agonizing.  There are so many things you'd like to do, but which are the most important and which might get grabbed by another player before your next turn?

Workers placed to build city tiles, or activate built tiles with a red circle on it, gain experience (by incrementing the pip) when they return to the player - those placed on a blue circle do not.  Deciding which worker to use for the different tasks, so that some might level-up and some not, becomes a key factor in your play.  In general, the higher the pip value the more return you'll get from placing the worker.  But a worker that reaches a value of six is retired (removed from your active workforce) which can have positive and/or negative consequences for you.

The lead swaps between the players virtually every round, and it's only in the last round or two that a likely winner can be predicted.  All in all a very slick and satisfying game which escalates nicely to the end.

The good:  Beautiful artwork everywhere.  Lovely tiles, boards and rule book with clear examples.  Simple and enjoyable gameplay that is easily taught but belies a depth of game that presents a lot of tough decisions.

The not-so-good:  The mosaics on the corner of each city tile.  When a tile is built, the player orientates the tile against existing tiles, trying to match the difficult-to-discern colours at each corner to gain a few bonus points.

This slows the game considerably, as the four orientations are considered against all the tiles at the perimeter of an expanding play area.  And yet the result is nearly always the same, scoring the player typically 3-5 bonus points.

And this produces a chaotic patchwork of a city, with randomly orientated tiles all over the place that have no other relationship to the surrounding tiles.

When you couple this with the fact that activating dice are placed within the circle on a city tile, thus obscuring the benefit the tile grants, it means it becomes increasingly difficult to locate the tiles of interest to you.

We have adopted a house variant to overcome this:

We ignore matching the mosaics, just giving 4 bonus points as standard when building a city tile;  orientate the tiles so that they all face the same direction;  group similar tiles together to make it easier to see if what you want is available;  and don't put the activation dice on the circle - we put it beside the circle so that the resource is still visible and subsequent players can immediately see that the resource is taken and who took it. 

Overall: thoroughly enjoyable game that I'd be happy to play any time.

PS. We also play that the market cannot trade an unlimited amount of resources - instead we limit the number of cubes traded to the pips on the worker die used.  This makes for yet more tough decisions and increases the worth of the resource-producing tiles that might otherwise sometimes be sidelined by an unrestricted market.

PPS. The game doesn't come with enough cube resources to properly cater for 5 players, so be ready with some improvising when playing with that many.

Good idea, but implementation could be better. Gameplay similar to Lords of Waterdeep. Not always elegant (points for corners of buildings, errata adds more inconsistencies). General problematic game balance: the game got some bad reputation in the beginning, the designer has fixed them (long play time, overpowered tiles).

I wanted to like this game so much. I was immediately fascinated by its ideas and mechanisms. I tought it could be a different, clever worker placement game. I bought it and, while the game was on the way, I started reading about the problems that this game was having. I didn't want to belive it, then I played and I saw them too. Then I played it again with house rules, with variants, with the official variants... and the flaws were still there.

I loved the idea of workers getting older, the city building aspect that gives you more and more options, the morale track is cool and the components are also very nice. So many good ideas... and yet such bad design mistakes! It just doesn't work. It's too long for what the game offers and the balance of the strategies is broken no matter what. I wanted to like this game so much, but I'm shocked by some unexplainable design flaws, that every player noticed and the designer didn't. It makes me so mad! Deeply disappointing.

JASE; but a nevertheless decent game. The art is passable; but the Blacksmith tile looks like it was accidentally replaced with a scene from Star Wars. Contrary to what everyone else has said about the balance issues, I find it delightful how one's fortune swings through the course of the game, and a dead-last player can (in the final quarter of the game) suddenly make a comeback while the players in the lead watch their workers languish in retirement!

RATING: 6
The game doesn't appear properly playtested. The placement scoring of the tiles doesn't add anything to the strategy, except for the confusion arising from buildings facing in all four orthogonal directions.

One building, the one that allows your retired workers to take an action, is overpowered, effectively giving the owner 3 gold from all other players each round.

There is downtime, especially with five players. The game shouldnÂ´t be played with more than four.

The game play itself is ok, but nothing special. There are (many) better worker placement games out there!

We love games set int the theme of Ancient Rome. It is personally my favorite era in history. Now the theme isn't strong in this one but it still pulls you in with the artwork and the mechanics. It feels like a micro-civ game. You build up your part of the city for bonuses and benefits. Rome grows before you adding more and more options. The worker placement system is unique in that you use dice as the workers. Yes. Yes. Dice as workers! That isn't unique! Ah ... but this is the only dice placement game where your workers level up as they work. And when they reach 6 pips they retire. The "pay your people" aspect of the game is a bit annoying ( too much like "feed your people") and some of the tiles are too overpowering but you can easily mitigate that simply by removing said tiles from the game ( I think there are 2. A temple and some market). It's a unique game and well worth the investment.

Preferred with 3 to 4 as much less downtime.  Worker placement with small tile usage costs, except when using your own tiles.  Similar to Keyflower but you can't use tiles up for bidding.  Matching mosaics in corners added to downtime and patterns could have been clearer.  We dispensed with this in our second game and simply added 4 points per tile (as suggested elsewhere on this site).  The retiring workers reminded me of Key Market.  Nice story arc and timing issues and the Labour Camp was a neat was of the retirees returning and using their considerable (6) experience.  The game would have benefitted from more variety, much as Keyflower does.  Maybe not all the tiles should be available at the different player counts, i.e. play X out of Y tiles so that you can't bank on certain tiles coming out.  The promos may help here, but if so they should be in the box.  The Temple of Mercy at (capped at 22 points) seemed too strong.  Maybe be better at 1 point per marble/weapon.  Similarly, maybe 3-4 fewer wall tiles would tighten the game up.  The game tends to finish on the exhaustion of the resource tiles and would benefit from a couple fewer rounds.  But overall an absorbing game.  The ageing of the workers is inspired.  The graphics could have been more functional and less Dixit.  Happy to play again.

Had a first game and found that it is not as terrible as what I have thought. There are indeed a few places where points can be accumulated. Will probably need more plays to see how balanced or unbalanced it is.

For now, I enjoyed the tile laying and constructing the city from scratch where both players are trying to construct various sections of the cities. The building of the Hadrian Wall is pretty thematic.

Bought first copy from Off the Charts. Looks fairly simple to play and fun. After 10 plays, mostly 2 player, there is a lot of depth. We like that the actions are "simple", but there are many important choices to make. The workers gaining experience makes it fun and adds another layer of strategy. The tile randomness makes each game slightly different because the order of the tiles coming out will alter each game significantly. This game is holding out very well.

RATING: 3
Don't see this coming to the table very often.  Too fiddly.  Really dislike the scoreboard and it's serpentine scoring.  I constantly had to make sure I was moving score markers the right direction.  With the two piece scoreboard, too easy to bump and dislodge the score markers.

Whoever goes first and is able to build a new worker should win the game.  If they keep their score lowest, they will have the build option first the entire important early part of the game and also uncontested actions each turn.  

The corner scoring mechanism only adds unnecessary time to the game.  Something to do while you rotate a tile, but very unlikely you choose a tile based on a few additional points other than the last round.  

Not a fan of how this whole thing lays out on the table.  Pictures and colors are nice, but cubes are mismatched.  Important information is very small and sacrificed to show the art which is really just pretty and serves no game purpose.

Initial Impressions
-------------------------

Has some interesting mechanisms.  Really liked the worker XP mechanism, which actually led to some very interesting choices. I REALLY hated the special placement aspect of the game. I mean, I get that it helps improve the choice of building something, but in the end, it felt to me that it ended up adding very little to the game.  Game also felt a little long for what it was. Interested to try again, but I was really excited for this game, and this was a pretty big let down for me...

I'm a bit surprised I like this as much as I do, maybe my tastes are switching back to euros, or maybe euros are getting a bit more thematic and interesting?

Anyway, on the surface a simple worker placement game where you have 2 choices a turn - place a worker (die) on a city tile to build it, or onto a built city tile to activate it. If you build the worker (die) improves, if you activate it will if the action is red.

Two main routes to victory, build the wall for ever increasing VP or build the city for immediate VP and try to build an efficiency engine to get VP.

Wrinkle is your workers are dice, and as they experience they get better (start at 1 and go up) but when they hit a 6 they retire and you can't use them - but still have to pay [which is a bit of theme disconnect, did Romans offer pensions outside of the army?)

So I like the art and components (although it's a bit odd the gold is value 1 and the silver value 5) and the worker placement getting more experienced and then retiring is novel and refreshing. Also the player boards are double-sided with the 'b' sides all being different.

However it's not all wonderful, the biggest issue is each city tile has a mosaic (one of 4 types) and you get bonus points for matching up the mosaic with already placed tiles. This should have been dropped in development - it adds to the length of the game: players search around working out the best orientation, and then you end up with tiles in all orientations which makes working out which tiles do what more difficult.

And it's for such little benefit, they could have just upped the VP for each tile to boost them and ignored the whole matching corner thing. If I play this regularly with a group I suspect we'll ignore it and just give an average d6 bonus points for each tile.

The wood cubes are orange - which is just odd, why not brown?

There has been some errata issued to - and it's best to play with that, as otherwise some elements are a bit broken:

Market - isn't unlimited, you only trade cubes equal to your worker die.

Labour camp is insanely overpowered if you own it - you get to use a retired worker for free, everyone else has to pay you 3 coins. Person who snags this wins. So errata has this as an unowned building (like the start buildings) and everyone has to pay to use it. Works fine like that!

VP generating temples give you VP for holding (not consuming) certain resources. This is bad, as it means you run out of the resources plus you score increasingly insane amounts of VP. Errata has it capped at 22 which is still pretty good, but not game breaking. (An alternative would be to spend the resources to get the VP)

Pros:
Solid WP game, with experience and retirement feature.

Neg:
Not polished enough and way too long. Game components (graphic design) leads to confusion and drags down the game. I like nice graphics, but here they are just anoying and go under in a blend of colours.
Inflationary scoring and way to many administration. 
Some tiles are seeming very strong and imba. (points for resources).
I guess that this game is best with 2-3 players. 
Warning our first time 4 pl game took 3h play time.

Very good, surprisingly heavy game with very simple, intuitive mechanics. It reminds me a bit of Keyflower, where you claim tiles that represent action slots, which you place advantageously for points, and which others have to pay you to use. Here, though, everyone shares the same "village" of tiles, and rather than auctioning for them, you race to build them first.

After all of the hullabaloo over the "brokenness" of the Temple of Mercury and the Labor Camp (and the Blacksmith and the Market) I didn't find these tiles to be problematic at all. Knowing that these tiles are powerful means you can either rush to build them first, or, in the case of an expensive tile like the Labor Camp, simply don't be tempted to use it unless you own it.

The game probably has a limited replay value because the engine you set up tends to be very similar each time you play. The end result is that the game gets kind of repetitive after a while, and I would prefer it if the game were a half-hour shorter. Expect my rating to drop a little with future plays.

I really don't like the aesthetics. By mid-game the board is so busy it's straining to just simply see what the options are, let alone consider them. I really don't like some of the design choices. Getting a mess of VP for building something is one thing, getting a mess of VP just for having something is another, and generally not good. I don't like the balance choices on the tiles. Some of them make crazy money, while others don't, without other balancing factors. In general I like the idea of workers that advance levels, and retire. But this just needed a little more development. The matching of corners when placing buildings is completely unnecessary, for example.

I've played today a second game of Praetor and I'm glad to say that the first impressions from an early prototipe (played sometime in winter 2013) are confirmed: it's a solid worker placement game(tile laying as a secondary mechanic) with a nice graphic. I think the final printed graphic it's gonna be nothing else than "eye candy". There are pleasant new  additons to this genre : workers get experience with the actions they take and  they retire at level 6, bringing you victory points depending of the era you're in; workers need a salary and if you don't pay you get on the minus spaces of "happy faces" track which translates in "-" victory points; also you can get "+" points if your workers are happier (reminds me of "Throgh the ages"); tiles you buy gets you the number of victory points printed on them but also you get some more or less points depending on how you manage to place the tile you bought, matching the corner colors of the tiles already placed...
I played it in 3 players and it took about 1:30, 1:45 h with explanations from Andrei Novac so it's gonna be a lot shorter when all the players know the game from previous sessions.
For me it's a winner and I'm anxiously waiting for it to hit the market!

Praetor has a lot of game for a small amount of rules.  When done well your tiles will compliment each other to make you more and more powerful as you add tiles.  
When you make a couple bad decisions in a row you may have trouble keeping up.
Fun game.  Looks to have good replay value.  Definitely worth a couple plays to see if you like it.

Neat dice as variable worker strength mechanism with a 'retire' mechanic when the dice get too powerful.

Not sure about this one yet. We played a game with very late appearance of second and third Ausbildungslager-Tile. The player which fell behind in VP`s and used this to train additional workers, in the end won the game while the other players where for a long time stuck with only 3 workers.

I don't know yet if there are strategies to counter this but at the moment I feel one could as well stop playing after a few rounds when this situation occured.

[b][FirstPlayOn26thMay2014][/b] I had high hopes for Praetor. I think the way you use the pips on the die to track a worker's experience is neat (you never roll the dice in Praetor). The tile laying aspect of the game when you construct a building is okay (orientating the tile in a certain way, especially when it creates a coherent mosaic with adjacent tiles gives you extra VP). I don't know, there's just something about the game that left me lukewarm.

Only one play so far, I have to try it again to form a better opinion.

Two new mechanisms. Mosaic to score addditional points (neat concept but rotating tiles is annoying) and workers' retirement (this one is OK). Take those out and you will get a tile version of Caylus. On top of that there are several IMBA tile actions you want to trigger every turn. That ruins the game. If you have never played a WP game, go for it. If you have, think it over before you buy it.

Good mid-weight worker placement euro.  Has elements of various games - Le Havre/Peloponnes spring to mind - and nothing especially new, but done well and the theme ties in. Some concerns about the abilities of some buildings- Labour Camp and some of the Temples, but the latter can only be used once per round, and one would need to be first player otherwise can be blocked.  Next game will play Labour camp/s as being unowned and see how that goes.

RATING: 5
One 4P game thus far.  The worker training, experience, and retirement was fantastic.  The buildings powers, resources and morale were good, if typical.  The bonus for matching corner colors is something that should have been trimmed from the design.  It does not add many tactical decisions, but only slows the game a bit as the most valuable spots are found.  Worse, it varies the orientation of all the building, which makes it rather difficult to parse what is out there and what is available.  I'll play it again, but I won't ask for it and I don't see it becoming a favorite.  Which is a shame, because the worker system is EXCELLENT!

Although the game reads up to 5 players, won't play it with more than 3, the table will become a real chaos. The game is good, liked it and will play whenever it comes to my table. At first glance is a worker placement game without anything else (place worker, execute the action), but the age/ experience of the owrkers is a really nice concept

Realitively simple rules, but requires a lot of thought. I like the building up of the city, which makes the game change to something more complex, as well as the mechanic of using dice to give workers experience from being used and finally become retired.

Decent game however some of the city tiles that you can build are completely overpowered.  It feels like the game wasn't tested enough.  There are definite tiles you want to make sure you build because they give you huge advantages.  

There is a great concept in the game where your workers level up and once they hit a certain age they retire.  I found managing the different workers and their experience to be a fun part of the game.

Weird bit shortage, given how powerful an engine you can end up setting up by the end-game. Also, lack of 100-point tiles for when players inevitably lap the score-board multiple times. Otherwise fantastic worker-placement game (I understand the second edition fixed some balance issues that kind of made the initial printing annoying).

RATING: 7.5
Medium weight worker placement.  Interesting concept with workers getting old then retiring to drain your cash in return for victory points.  Uses a resource card that allows you to put your retired workers back in play, although this seriously overbalances the cash flow between players and resources that can be taken (I've removed these cards to balance the game).  Plays a little long, although enjoyable.

Part of this I loved (theme, art, variety, worker placement and worker "maturing") and a few things I didn't (run-away leader, ability to get boxed out/more or less eliminated, explosive engines and extremely swingy scores).  Hoping the promo pack adds some balance or at least some options.  Felt like we MUST be playing the game wrong for it to swing so widely and for one of us to be so stuck behind or maybe it was broken but in the end we ended close in score (though how I do not know).  Odd but willing to try again.

RATING: 7
I liked this one. I like the spacial scoring opportunity, and the twist on worker placement.

Although as the game goes on the AP has the potential to get worse, not due to the sheer number of options, but because of the messiness of the game state, it's very busy, and hard to track from round to round.

I think that this is a fantastic medium weight game with a few exceptions. First of all make sure to check the errata as a couple tiles are terribly broken without it. Also matching the corner of the tiles when you place them feels arbitrary and very gamey. Ultimately though, I really enjoy the experience as it offers multiple legitimate paths to victory. I like the different sides of the player boards although I feel like some are completely imbalanced.

RATING: 5
Workers in Praetor are represented by dice. With most actions they gain experience and get stronger, i.e. they are turned to the next higher number. Some actions get more powerful when activated with a higher number. When a worker is turned to '6', he retires. Each turn, a player puts one worker in an available buildings and immediately performs actions like gaining or trading resources, training new workers, erecting new buildings or later in the game directly gaining VPs.

Praetor is a strategic worker placement game. It helps to know what buildings will show up and to prepare for them. Various very strong strategies seem possible that need to be actively countered by other players to avoid a runaway victory. Balancing in part is put into the hands of the players. In so far, it's rather interactive. Hopefully, none of the strategies proves too strong.
 
It lacks some of the streamlining of an experienced developer. The element of aligning corners and earning points for equal colors was more annoying than relevant. Only once in a game it was used for a purpose. The positive effect of re-activating retired workers is so powerful that it's mostly a no-brainer decision.

Praetor is an ok game but given that worker placement is not my favourite genre, this is not enough for me.

RATING: 8.6
Don't understand the low rating. This is a cool worker placement with dice being your workers which age each round you use them. But when they are too old they retire which gives you victory points but leaves you without workers - and you still have to pay for them!!!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Solidly entertaining game and I love the use of dice to represent workers of varying skill levels. I think the only thing is that you've got to home brew some of the scoring rules for certain tiles or it just turns into a race to whoever can get those runaway favor points spots.

Feels unbalanced and in desperate need of streamlining. The mosaic matching is a chore that slows the game down, made worse by hard-to-distinguish mosaics, and it results in a messy tableau that sprawls across the table more than it ought to.

The experience/retirement mechanic is compelling, but without something like Caverna's stipulation that workers be placed in ascending order, it just doesn't add enough to the game to justify the risk of dice getting knocked.

I might play this again in a few months, but only with house rules to address the issues that made it a horrible experience!

Good ideas: level as power of activation, leveling up and retirement. But poor execution: bad rulebook, pay for workers, matching mosaics, too many turns. Ultimately, simply not fun.

I like the idea that workers gain experience and get retired (and receive pension!). But there are a few things I don't like. First, it is a bummer to match colors and get extra points when you place a newly built tile. It unnecessarily slows down the game without adding any fun. Second, the graphic design leaves something to be desired. In terms of aesthetics, it's OK. In terms of functionality, it's not. Third, some tiles seem to be overpowered than others.

Just one play and the game isn't 100% finished yet - will have got published by Essen 2014. 

First opinion - there is large potential in this title and my "7" is just the starting note. When the editor finishes the graphics it will be really good. I'm really looking forward to it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
I could not bring myself to make this a 6. The game is well structured and is a simple worker placement to gain resources and victory points with a nice ageing mechanism to affect the workers. There is also a morale track which brings additional points and even a tile tessellation mechanism to scrape a few more points. It should work - but does not. 
The tiles are badly balanced with a couple of key tiles ruling the game so the owner of these starts to obtain a clear advantage, second to this is the fact that towards the end it starts to stagnate with Analysis Paralysis as players search for the best of what has been left for them. Our 4 player game lasted a good 2+ hours - which was far too long for what this game is. 
Others have had a few balancing ideas/fixes, but this should have been sorted before publication but I will give them a go before condemning this game fully.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Remains to be seen.  Right now I'm a bit ambivalent about the game.  I like the aspects of the workers aging and retiring and the wall building is an interesting timer/point machine, and I also like the way you gain income from other players if they use the tiles you build.  However, some of the tiles feel a bit overpowered but perhaps this is just first play impressions.  There are some wild swings in points as some scoring is low and other scoring is over 20 points.  I would be interested in playing again.

Praetor is a prototype that was released into the wild far too early. Upside - The aging/power of workers based on pip value is a compelling mechanic, as is the decision of whether to age a worker. Downsides - Poorly written rulebook, determining turn order in reverse vp order allows one player to go first over and over and load up on workers, matching edges of purchased tiles slows game down and adds little strategically. Perhaps turn order should depend on number of active workers with least going first. Hell, even rotating first player would be better than the current method.

There's a lot to like and to dislike about this game. On the minus side, it spins out of control in the latter stages, wherein turn order determines whether a player gets the 30-, 20-, or 10-point move. And the fun factor isn't high. On the plus side, there are modular changes that entice, namely asymmetric starting configurations and end-game bonuses. There could be enough to explore for a 2nd game. It is also simple enough to teach in about 20 minutes in a sample first round.

RATING: 6
This is a really good game, with a bit of a unique twist on worker placement, allowing your workers to advance in effectiveness, then eventually retire from your worker pool. The game should really be rated a 7. But I found that keeping track of the correct values on each of the die, which ones changed, which ones stayed the same, to be a bit tedious. Recommended game. But I will have to be in the right mood to play.

This game provides some interesting worker placement mechanics. Unfortunately scoring is not balanced and in the end scoring just gets out of hand. The game end is never reached because it's more rewarding to score than to build. Saving resources to score points for owning them is much more rewarding than using them to build.

RATING: 7
Praetor is a really interesting worker placement game in which, as workers are used, they gain experience and are able to do their actions better. However, once they get to a certain level, they retire, meaning that you can't use them any more but you have to keep paying their "pension". I really liked the concept, but the resource management aspects of the game didn't seem very tight, as some tiles/strategies didn't seem particularly well-balanced. There were also some graphic design issues, specifically with the tile corner patterns.

Heidelberger bargain, we really liked our first play of this. I like building games, don't mind the tile laying aspect (though it's prettier if the tiles all face the same way). The mechanism of the workers getting more experienced (so better at some things), and then retiring (still costing you money, but you can't use them), is interesting, it makes for some good choices.

RATING: 1
Why did I rate this game - for the moment - a 1? Well, I like to follow the BGG description of giving ratings and a 1 is a game you think is 'clearly broken'. In this game however it's just 1 single tile, the Temple of Mercury, that just screws up the entire game imho. I've written why in this post: http://boardgamegeek.com/article/15850362

Without this tile or a house rule (which I haven't tried out yet), I think I would rate this somewhere between 7 - 8. My only concerns then would be that it takes a tad too long for what it is and that the extra scoring from the coloured squares at the corners of the city tiles, don't add a lot to the playing experience, but increase the level of AP a lot.

The big plus about this worker placement game is the use of the dice as workers and how they get older and even retire after a while. That's a clever mechanism.

Great concept - tile placing and worker placement workers gaining experience and retiring - slowed down by silly tile placing rules and potentially ruined by a ridiculously overpowered tile (the infamous Temple of Mercury). Would have been an 8 without these two problems.

I've only played a 2 and 3 player game, but as far as I'm concerned the suspected overpowered tiles(Labor Camp, Mercury Temple) are just that and breaks the game, making it a painful slog. I liked the idea of worker experience and retirement, but with the rules as written, I don't even want to try playing any more games to further confirm any balance issues. Rahdo, why have you led me astray? 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This game breaks my heart. For the first half of the game everyone was having a fantastic time. The last half, things turned very sour, and the game revealed many many flaws, all of which would have been easily fixable. Let me begin by saying what this game does right. I love the dice as workers, and I love how they get stronger and do their jobs more effectively when sent to build new tiles or take the actions on red tiles. I love how when the workers hit the 6 side, they retire to a special part of your board where you still need to pay for their upkeep but they can't do anything. I also love how many games these days have you build an engine, but then the game ends pretty much as soon as it's built. Here, the game's timer is a little longer, so you can really enjoy your engine.

Note, we played with the errata posted by the designer. Here's what's wrong with the game.
1. There should only be one spot to activate a retire worker, and there are two. Not being able to use retired workers is a core limiting mechanic in the game, and being able to undermine it twice per turn seems a bit much.
2. The promo building that lets players take starting player negates the important catchup mechanic of forcing the player with the most points to go last.
3. The buildings are not consistent. Some of them activate based on strength of worker. Others, just activate once.
4. Buildings that give you points for resource stockpiles, firstly should only convert resources to points based on the strength of the worker, and second, should spend those resources. The way it's written now, if you have 11 marble and send a level 1 guy, you get 22 points and keep the marble to take the action again on the next turn. When you build new tiles for points you spend the resources. I feel using these tiles should be the same.
5. The building that generates points for retired workers is too strong, as the player with retired workers is likely in the lead anyway.
6. The mini-game of placing tiles so the corners match with other corners takes too long for what it is, and adds nothing to the fun of the core game. I've seen users comment that they ignore this,and just add 4 to the VP printed on the tile. I think this is the correct approach.
7. The game doesn't come with nearly enough resources or claim disks. The rulebook has an error which says only the resources are supposed to be unlimited, but the designer claimed here that the claim disks are also supposed to be unlimited, and I wish I had known that since I wasted a good number of turns sitting on a lot of resources in our game before looking at the forums.

I would be happy to play this many more times with the previous fixes applied, along with the variant of making the game 5 rounds shorter. That being said, I have so many games, it's hard to pick one that needs heavy house rules to be playable.

In it's current state the game is nearly unplayable. Wild swings in points caused by imbalanced tiles. It becomes a game of "take that" as each player spends the majority of the time blocking their opponent's best moves or letting some players be runaway leaders. I have not played with the official FAQ/errata yet, but I hope it balances things out. It seems like there is a good game buried somewhere in here.

RATING: 5
Rather heavy worker placement game. Workers have an experience system (symbolized with dice) and get more effective (but this matters only for resource gathering), but will eventually retire. Erecting buildings gives new action spaces, which all players can use for a smalle fee to the owner. 

There are quite a lot of different mechanisms interwoven and different strategies to try out. The effectiveness of the strategies will depend on how soon the corresponding scoring buildings will be available. However, some buildings seem to be clearly stronger than others. The color mechanism for bonus scoring for buildings is totally unnecessary and just prolongs this beast of a game.

Update:Rating reduced from 6 to 5.
My first rating was after one play at a convention. I have not played it since, but several reviewers I follow, confirmed that all imbalances I only suspected after first play are true. Maybe the downgrading is unfair, but I have very little desire to play Praetor again. The designer has proposed several fixes to nerf different buildings, but I expect a game to be tested well enough that no major fixes (especially multiples) are needed.

This is a city building/worker placement game with some very clearly defined, and easy to teach rules and goals.  Each turn a player places one of his workers on a tile to build it or on an already built tile to use it.  Using an opponent's tile requires you to pay them a fee.  This game is very no-nonsense, it gets right to the point.  The tiles either produce resources that can be used to build other tiles or provide points somehow.

Each tile built is also worth a certain amount of points and each of the corners of a tile has a pattern on it and if you match this pattern to the corners of other tiles it touches when placed you get bonus points.  These aren't unsubstantial, especially when extrapolated over the course of the game.  Our gaming group has a tendency to just point out which location provides the most points no matter who's turn it is though so there's no real thinking involved (this is more to just make sure the game doesn't drag since if we didn't do this whoever is placing the tile would just take longer to figure it out themselves).

The one really neat thing is the mechanic of workers in this game gaining experience and retiring.  The workers are tiny little dice and the pips showing represents the worker's "level".  Many of the spaces in the game provide increased rewards the more pips showing on the worker and building a tile with that worker or using an action space that represents some kind of labor (such as collecting resources) levels the worker up.  When a worker gets to 6 pips he retires.  This means you can't use him any more (without a special tile) but you still have to pay him a pension every turn.

Yes, by the way, you have to pay all your workers each turn and it really wears on me how much some gamers complain about feeding or paying their workers in worker placement games.  Do they not realize that without some upkeep to these workers these games would fall apart?  If you don't provide a cost to workers there's no point in having variable worker counts at all.  I'm not going to start a rant here but it really is one of the stupidest things ever for a gamer, especially a high profile gamer, to complain about that kind of mechanic.

This game has some serious balance issues when it comes to some of the tiles however and all-in-all the no-nonsense mentality of getting to the most number of points the fastest also makes it kind of humorless and dry.  I do like the worker experience mechanic and it certainly isn't a bad game, just not one that elicits any kind of excitement from me.

May be somewhat broken; if the second 'train a new worker' tile doesn't come out early, someone can avoid getting points in order to be first in turn order, take that action first each turn, and lock the other players out of new workers.  The 'show off your resources for points' tiles have issues too.

A game with several interesting twists; I especially like the retired worker mechanic. However, the Temple of Mercury is too strong while several other locations (e.g., Labor Camp and Blacksmith) rise above too. 

The tableau ends up being a jumbled mess because of the mosaic matching mechanic. Also, the game is too long (two plays, 3 hours each) for what it is. 

Further, there should have been more components (for example, we kept running out of resources in a 5-player game). Orange wood cubes that are red on the tile - how about brown? Didn't ship with its promos, either.

Similar to too many KS releases we've seen, this game could have benefitted from an additional round of development and streamlining. I can see several house rules (e.g., Marketplace) being necessary here.

Add this to the glut of titles that fall short of their potential as this is a poorly constructed, bad game. Pass.

Brilliant worker-placement game.  I love how you own tiles in the city and have to pay other players to use their.  Best of all is the use of dice as workers so they gain experience and get better at their job.  Once they get too good, they retire.  And then you have to pay them pensions!

This game works great for 2.  If it's even just as good with more then I will raise this rating.

Has the common problem of when a player gains extra actions they romp away. In this game is is compounded because you can also LOSE actions. In first game one player had eight actions per turn to our two. Carnage.

I like this game a lot.  A clean and fun mechanic.  The workers with experience do give you a lot to think about.
Graphics are very nice.

The corner thing does not bother me att all.  It's a fun extra to score points.  but that's also because in our group people tend to decide quick on things.  So it isn't thing that causes slack.

Maybe some cards should be a little trimmed down.  Like the card where you can change cubes into points. 
We tried some variants, where  you have to give a way the half of what you score, or that only one can activate the action, instead off all... both worked fine.

So there are some minor comments to be made.  But the game is fun each time we play it. So that means those minor things are not a fun spoiler

As far as 2 players goes technically speaking the game works as it should. Practically though it's not really that much fun. You want 4 or 5 with this one so there's more tension over the tiles/buildings. Also helps break up the longest group of player tiles with more players.

I know this one might seem a little rough around the edges, corner matching possibly the roughest of them all, but hopefully it'll play out well.

Second play, I don't think it grows on me, in fact quite the opposite. A lot of the tiles are too overpowered, leaving the rest of the players with nothing to do.

Don't understand the rather mediocre rating it received. It feels like some people just watched the Dice Tower review and immediately judged it as "imbalanced" based on Tom's opinion. I haven't found any balance issues in a 2-player game. If at some point I ever run into them I'll just use the author's proposed modifications.

If somebody thinks about skipping on this one based on the ratings, then I'd say go watch Rahdo's videos of it. He nailed it with what the game has to offer. 

It's above average in my opinion and really fun to play. Plus it comes with quality components, beautiful artwork and a nice theme. This underrated gem definitely stays in my collection.

your workers are dice, they get better, they eventually retire, but you have to pay all your workers, even the retired ones... some Caylus-like building ownership/payouts on a tile board... I only wish the tile placement meant more than just a few one-off VP's... otherwise good game...

Excellent mechanics, but too long even with 3 players.
Some buildings too disproportionate in usage cost vs benefit and exponential benefits not capped: makes final rounds completely frozen with AP and huge changes in positions after 2 hours of play. Somewhat unfair.

Good gameplay but the tiles look too similar.  We kept stumbling on the similarities.

151120 I remember really enjoying this game as a kid the few times I came across it.  I'd like to revisit it at some point but I don't love it enough to go out of my way to play it.  Even though the remove stone rules is inelegant, I suspect I enjoy that aspect of the game.  Maybe it lightens ups the austerity of something like Connect6.

Simple and elegant, with some depth. It's refreshing to play a non-trivial game with simple rules once in a while. The tendency towards symmetric positions due to their strength leads to some pretty interesting sequences of play.

A Thrift Store find.  My wife loves it so we've played it a lot.  Great decision making for such a short game and has a puzzle-solvey feeling that I enjoy since you can often force a win with a series of well thought out moves.  Very few games have this amount of depth in such a short play time.

RATING: 7.3
Nice abstract game for two people, though it is a little too easy for one player to take control and basically dictate what moves the other player makes if both players are not equally skilled.  Interesting with four players.

This used to be our go-to travel game, though I see this being phased out by [I]Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small[/I].  Still, I love that a game of this can be played in 5-15 minutes.

IMO, Pente is very underrated here on the BBG.  If you can see the patterns formed early on, this game provides a very rich gaming experience.  

The tubed editions are naturally superior to the tradition board edition.

RATING: 7
Classic abstract game I enjoyed playing growing up as a kid. The thing that makes this abstract unique is that it plays with 2, 3 or 4 players and with 4 players you can also play teams. Games aren't too long either. Pick one up at a thrift store if you come across it.

decent abstract.  i'd like to see a board with recessed holes for piece placement.  starting advantage does seem strong despite having to place your second piece 3 or more squares away, but i'm a newbie.  i also wonder how many patterns a pro can learn before the game becomes kind of solved, but then again i've heard there are tournaments for this game.  why do i worry about that crap anyway?  it's still fun.

I received this game for Christmas 1977 from my folks. A buddy of mine cane by the house that afternoon and we played the stinking thing well into the night. We must have played 100 or more games that evening. It is hard to believe that a game this simple that plays so fast can be as addicting as it is. I have played this game literally thousands of times down thru the years and I never pass up an opportunity to outfox someone whenever they want to play. AN ALL TIME FAVORITE.

Played four times in a row with the wife as we learned it, once she saw the mechanics in action it was almost all over for me,I managed another win out of the four, but the ones I flubbed were very careless on my part. I like that about this game, it will force one to pay attention akin to a more serious strategy game like Chess, or Go, or even Othello. It will not carry the stiff reputation of those games, seeing as how it adds in the four player aspect, but it is a fun game, you can learn it in 40 seconds, but it will take some time to master! I am grateful for this one in my colleciton as well, and look forward to many years of doing so.

I'd been playing this game for many years, usually against the same person, which was great because we'd learned the subtleties of the game together.

Now however, I've learned that it's not as much fun to play when you've been away from it for years and your opponents are not the person you played with every week for a decade. 

So, really, my original '9' rating for the game was more about my personal experiences with a friend than it was about Pente. Score adjusted to reflect reality check.

I've played a lot of this in years gone by.  And it's about the same as every other abstract, just a soulless posing of the question "you think I think you think"... ad infinitum.  At least it's pretty.  Will anyone ever make an abstract that rises to the challenge of other games?

My wife picked this up for my at a Goodwill store for $2! The game was in very good condition (the board was perfect and the stones were bagged). The box had a bit of wear, but nothing serious. Heck, the rulebook was still there!

Looking forward to teach her this game!

RATING: 8.1
Pente is a 5-in-a-row game with another, very different win condition. Five captures will also win you the game. The balance between the two is quite good. Sacrifices and comebacks are quite common. Unfortunately, first player advantage requires a "fix" for advanced play. I think there is maybe opportunities in this area of the design space, connect versus capture on a Go board, but the first player advantage has to be addressed more naturally.

A classic abstact game, both short and interesting - the tension between making five in a row and capturing pairs works well.  However, there is a strong advantage to the person who goes first, and the game feels solvable.  A great game to analyze with a friend.  
Update 11-22-06: Alright, we're done analyzing.  The player who goes first always wins.  Downgraded from 7 to 4

RATING: 3
Strategically a good game.  Just too many other similar games make it to the game table first & this one sits on the shelf.  Also my mat is a soft roll-up one that, because it sits on the shelf so long, doesn't lay flat, and stored in a long tube which creates a shelf storage problem.

RATING: 9.5
I'm surprised that I just only recently discovered this gem of a game.  It plays quickly and gives the players interesting choices to make.

I've played it as a two-, three-, and four-player game, and it's been fun each time.  (Although when playing with more than two players, one player's mistake can unfairly help and hurt other players.  It's still fun, though.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

A cross between Connect 4 and Go.  A good game to play if you are in the mood for Go, but don't have time to play a full game.  A good game in its own right.

Pente started as a Copyfraught of the traditional Japanese game Ninuki Renju. According to a former Pente world champion the first player has a sure win if he plays well. The Pente rules are a simplification of Ninuki Renju, which is the very reason for being a flawed game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This slight variation of Go-moku can be played on your standard Go board when you're in the mood for something a bit lighter than the "real" game. This is preferable to playing with an "official" pente set, as I am not convinced enough stones are supplied for a protracted game.  A good starter game to get youngsters interested in strategy and a pleasant enough filler for more advanced players.

RATING: 9
Underrated, at least that's my opinion.  Not sure how deep it really is, but it certainly is deep enough to keep your interest for several plays.  So far have been playing it at least 3 times whenever it's brought out.  This is probably the quickest abstract strategy game out there to play that still manages to require a bit of thought depending on the game.  The longer it plays, the more complex the moves and decisions get.

RATING: 7
A very nice abstract.  The few minor changes from go-moku really make this an excellent game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Great game with two players.  You win by either getting five-in-a-row (as in Go Moku) or capturing five pairs of stones (unique to Pente).  You can get five-in-a-row by getting an unblocked four-in-a-row, so that ends up being your goal.

With more than two players an unblocked four-in-a-row is not a threat, so winning by getting five-in-a-row is nearly impossible.  Most wins are by capturing five pairs of stones.

I learned this game a long time ago. I enjoy it but I only have one friend who will play it with me. Our games are epic. We are very evenly matched. That makes this game great. Every time we get together we unroll the pente board and do a best of three. It almost always goes to that third game. I am rating this high because of the nostalgia that it gives me.

I played Go with my six year old, giving her 20 stones and still beat her. She, however, did not quite like the game. She did enjoy 3 player Pente with no handicaps, with Mom and her ganging up against me and beating me.

4 player Pente becomes a negotiation game, you have to convince the other players to play in your favor, if for any reason you put them off, they will turn against you and make you lose.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a delightful abstract game.  The rules can literally be learned in less than a minute.  The board is elegant in its simplicity, and can also be used to play Go (but that is another thread..).  

I find that younger players enjoy this as well, as long as more experienced players grant them a couple extra stones as a handicap.  You can also play this multi-player with as many colors as you have (I have over 8 sets) but it becomes a little bit of a king-maker game.  It is also somewhat portable.  

I encourage everyone to get this game, unless you absolutley loath abstracts.

Pente is a lot like Othello, only not as fun. The grid layout on the game board can lead to some confusion, especially with new players. I often found myself wondering why the game was designed this way. Wouldn't it be much simpler to put the stones inside the squares versus on the intersections? Much less, the 'jumping only two' rule is highly prohibitive, leading to less variety in game-play and strategy. Othello is a much better game with a similar premise -- you should play that instead. Everything Pente does, Othello does better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game is a good quick filler play game.  The strategy seems faily elementary and there isn't much luck to speak of.  It's a good game and worth a play every now and then to mix things up.  I remember playing this a cross country camp and had a great time playing it.

As a rip-off of a Japanese Go game for kids, it's not bad.  (Why change the pasted on theme from Japanese to faux-Greek?)
Good for kids.

Update:  After playing many times in the last months, this is also a good game for adults.  It remains at a 6, though, as it is only a 2-player game (don't talk to me about pasted on additional player rules), and there are quite a few other two player games I would rather play.

Note that this is essentially the rules for Yucata's "Gobang".  Nowhere else on BGG can I find those rules (5-in-row, capture pairs).  So, I will log Yucata's Gobang here.
(Simply 5-in-a-row does have its own entry, Go-Moku.)

Great abstract but I've played it a lot. Unlike Go, is something you can get good at in this lifetime. Chess has been so over analyzed, you end up playing someone who has memorized move trees. This game only has a little written on it. Its weakness is the lack of a handicapping system as elegant as Go's. Stopped tracking dates of play and just periodically add a bunch to keep the total correct.

RATING: 7
Fun, quick game. I've only played the 2-player (strategic) version, although I understand there's a multiplayer variant.

Games last just a few minutes, but there's enough to think about that it's entertaining.

Easy enough to make yourself so you can try it out. If it grows on you, buy the real deal for the nice pieces.

Simple rules, great game play.  A modern simplified variant to a more ancient game, Ninuki-Renju.  After it grew in popularity, players discovered imbalanced game play for the first player to move, and started to modify the rules, but I think the original Ninuki-Renju had already solved this.

Another game worth playing that you should not actually pay for. Nice quick abstract. Doesn't have the replayability of Y or Zertz. (well what does?) Intriguing simplification of Japanese ninuki-renju, re"invented" for the American audience. Rates slightly higher than Gomoku or Renju because I think the capture rule makes forces more interesting, but it's still an "in-a-row" game, meaning I'd probably only play with non-gamers.

What a great game. Its like tic tac toe all grown up. Its so simple and yet so rewarding and fun to play. 

I don't like how the game plays with more than 2 players at all. I've tried it many times and it always turns into: one player deciding which of the other players will win (by choosing who to stop). It is clearly a 2 player game, and a worthy one!

When I was in the Cancon games library I had an opponent and we were looking for a quick to learn and quick to play two player game. My opponent has a thing for abstracts (I know, right?) and this was on the shelf so we checked it out and then checked it out. The basic idea is that you want to get five of you stones in a row on the grid that comprises the board. You can capture any row of two (and only two) stones if you surround them with your stones. Capturing five pairs of stone from your opponent is the other victory condition.

P is very easy to learn and plays exceptionally well. Each game we played was absorbing without being too much and as we played more games we began to appreciate to learning curve that this game has.  It was well worth playing but not one I’ll rush out and purchase but it is a game I would not refuse to play again.

I've had this game since 1982, and although I misplaced it for almost twenty years, I recently revived it, bought 3 extra bags of stones, and has been a smash at my parties!  Playing the advanced rules and 4 or more (multiplayer) is very challenging.  However, when playing multiplayer, some players tend to build their 'lines' separate from the other players, which has become a problem in ending the round (designated by 4 captures).

Classic two player abstract game where one tries to get five in a row of their stones or capture five pairs of your opponents' (you can capture two at a time by having your stones surrounding two adjacent enemy stones).

Excellent development of Go-Moku (five-in-a-row on a Go board), offering an alternative to the strong first player advantage that feels more natural than the asymmetric conditions and the convoluted starting procedure in Renju: players can take pairs of pieces by interception (sandwiching them), five of which grant a win.

Very nice classic game. I suggest to play this game on Internet, also with the "Keryo" variation (you can capture either 2 or 3 opponent's stones). Pente is a very deep game and much faster and dynamic than the normal go-moku. Anyway too tactic and sometimes boring.

I almost never play this game anymore, due mostly to the huge pile of great abstract games that have released in the last several years, but it's a decent game playable by up to four players.  The ability to achieve victory via captures keeps the game tense and prevents it from dragging.  This was an important step for me into gamerhood, and helped spark my love of abstracts.

Excellent and quick abstract. I thought I hated all abstracts and this taught me otherwise. 

If the rules had been that players won only be capturing or only by 5 in a row then it would have been a bad game but the combination make it awesome. 

My games have averaged about 4 minutes and my 7yo daughter love love loves it. She hasn't won yet but takes pride in it taking longer and longer for me to beat her. :) 
6/3/16

The game that made abstracts appealing again. 
It is a n-in-a-row style game but adds an intriguing capture mechanic that makes the whole experience worth while. It takes about 5-10 minutes to play and is fun every time.

I must have played well over a hundred games when I first picked this up. I love how fast the games go, and the reasonable depth of strategy. Back in the day I would have rated it a 10.

It's only a 7 now because I've burnt out on this game a bit.  I do wish there was a decent iOS implementation - I think much can be done with all of the recorded match plays online - those would make for a decent opening book (x4, since identical games could play out on 90º rotations)

played with 2, this is a neat n-in-a-row variant involving captures as an alternate victory condition.  Sadly, the real appeal of the game (to me) is the potential for an n-in-a-row game to scale to more players.  Pente, however, is not that game -- it stalls out with more players or becomes pure kingmaking.

This is a great game, it is simple to learn yet as complex once the game gets going.  The best part is that a new player can give an experienced player a tough time even after only one or two games.

A decent abstract game with (my copy, at least) very nice production.  The board is a roll-out vinyl map, with a grid and Greek vase-style artwork, and the pieces are little glass gems that work nicely.  The version I have comes in a tube.  

The gameplay is a variation on Connect Four, or Gomoku,  and it plays somewhat similarly to YINSH, or even Go.  2 or 4 players (as partners) try to outwit their opponent(s) and connect five of their color gems in a row.  

The game plays fine, but is extremely light.  Single rounds play in 5 minutes at the most, and the replay value is middling.  Another odd complaint is that the gameplay rarely moves past a small, contained area, so the game mat is much bigger than necessary.  The pieces could have remained the size of Go pieces (as they are in Gomoku).

Not a bad abstract, but not one with a lot of strategy or replay value.  Great production, though.

A pleasant little abstract strategy game that I played more of in high school.  Unfortunately, the first time I played, my oppenent forgot to mention the rule about capturing five pairs of stones.  I was setting up a nice victory, sacrificing all sorts of stuff (I was a chess player at the time) to have the position I needed.  Then out of nowhere, he tells me he won -- huh?  Well, I played again, and really enjoyed it.  I was happy to pick up a cheap copy not too long ago.

I have a misleading 210 [i](or so, I've been playing more of late on www.pente.net)[/i] plays of this logged. Truthfully I've played this probably 500 times or more. I'd LOVE to play this more, but only in person, abstracts online don't thrill me so much. Before I started logging plays, I played this for years on and off with my Dad and Brother. Years later, after we stopped playing MtG at work, my friend and I played this for almost a year. (If we gamed 200 days in a year and played 5 games a day, we'd be at 1000, so my 500 number is probably conservative.) Over and over we tested opening strategies and their counters. At the height of our playing I'd have said I was ready for any tournament. Looking back, I'm sure there must have been tricks we didn't know about because of our closed testing. I have the tube edition with the lovely faux leather board. More games should come on such an excellent surface.

Pente is a great game.  If you're not ready to delve into the infinite depth of Go, Pente is perfect.  You can even play it multiplayer, although that changes the nature of it quite a bit to something much more light-hearted.  Playing Pente on a wooden Go board with slate and shell stones really makes for a wonderful experience.

Just didn't enjoy this game as much as an adult as I did when I was a kid. My ex-boyfriend and I played a bunch of this game over the course of several nights, and outside of outrageous mistakes on one of our parts, it just seems as if the first person to go always wins. We weren't able to come up with an alternate start-egy that made it so the second person won, assuming the first person was playing at their best.

Pente es un juego de estrategia abstracta. Los jugadores colocan marcadores de vidrio en las intersecciones de una red de 19-por-19 (el mismo que en Go). El objetivo del juego es conseguir que cinco de sus propios marcadores en una fila (4 con más de 2 jugadores) o capturar cinco pares de piezas de su oponente. El primero en hacer cualquiera victorias. La captura se produce cuando exactamente dos piezas se intercalan entre las piezas del color opuesto. Existen múltiples variaciones del juego para mayor desafío y la complejidad. La edición 20 aniversario es una versión de lujo del juego con un gran libro de color partida de ejemplo, la calidad del tablero de juego, y seis juegos de diferentes marcadores de vidrio de color que permite jugar con hasta 6 jugadores.

Otros cinco juegos en una fila incluyen Go-Moku y Renju (que no cuentan con la captura), y Ninuki-Renju (que lo hace).

My first real game.  I have the one I got *mumble* years ago, when I was a teenager.  I still love it.  And still no pieces missing. :)

I also have a version with a cardboard board.  And another that I turned into Billabong.

There was a time when Pente was my main game addiction.  My wife and I played hundreds of games (using the tournament variant as described in the rule book) over the course of a few months about five years ago.  We recently drug the 20th A.E. out and the game remains one of our favorite abstract strategy games.

RATING: 6
A reasonable take on the 5-in-a-row game, with captures added (somewhat similar to ninuki-renju).

The capturing means that it's a lot harder to analyze.  Playing first is still an advantage, but the restriction on the second move of the first player puts the game in some doubt.  Hasn't been solved yet, to the best of my knowledge.

This game has been around forever for a reason. If you have any interests at all in abstract games, you must play Pente.

fabulous!
Even if this may be a classic, i have never heard of pente before (2006), much to my regret.(quite an achievement ;-) not being able to search for a five-in-a-row game when you already know tic-tac-toe and connect-4 for decades). 
While the playing time is really short, it doesn't feel like a filler at all. Instead you'll find the whole dramatic development of longer games in condensed form. My only concern is the first player advantage, which is rather obvious (even when applying the tournanment rule). When playing 2nd, you are basically just defending yourself, a rather passive/reactive affair. Nevertheless, as long as i can go first and lose continuously against experienced players, this is no real problem for me. Besides, several variants/ additional rules exist that try to address this "problem", if this really is one. 
I can't believe how addictive this is.
Highly recommended (you should also try keryo-pente, excellent variant). 
If I could make a wish (in all modesty) I really would like to see Pente's and Ingenious' average ratings being swapped.

This game is a early stage in the evolution of Go-Moku.  It's great as a kids game, or as introduction to Go-Moku, but doesn't really deserve any serious attention by itself from adults.

RATING: 8
A beautiful concept in game.  When playing for 5 captures or 5-in-a-row, it's almost like playing two games in one, at the same time...if that makes any sense.  Between two equals, this game is probably the most elegant game I've played, next to Chess.  It's only an 8 however, due to the ridiculous Pente Plus.

I have vivid memories of playing this with my father when I was young. I thought it was easy and great fun. When revisiting the game as an adult I did however find Pente to be quite empty and lacking in strategic depth. It fits when in hurry for a few fast matches but nothing else.

RATING: 5
It's another abstract.  I've played it a few times.  Not my favorite abstract, but certainly not the worst.  It's certainly got the innate simplicity, combined with a large amount of depth.  But I don't really care much about that, and I mostly find myself wishing to play something else.

This is a great but quick game. I disagree with the manufacturer though and prefer to play the original rules in which one must get exactly five-- no more, no less-- stones in a row or capture five pairs-- not triads-- to win. The manufacturer claims these revised rules make the game more challenging but I find quite the opposite.

See review.

Light abstract game played with stones on a 19 x 19 board like 'go'.  The object is to get 5 stones in a row or capture a certain number of opponents pieces.  Pente plays much faster than go or chess, but still has a similar feel.

I like abstract games, but Pente just didn't do anything for me.  I suppose it would be good for kids as a beginning abstract game, but you don't need to run out and buy it for that purpose.  If you're a gamer you've got the glass beads laying around, just use a large printed grid paper for the board and it probably doesn't even need to be full size.  For abstracts I prefer Dvonn or Yinsh.  While chess is too strong for my tastes, this is perhaps too simplistic.

Certainly one of the earliest game memories I have (of anything other than 'kid games').  It's...alright.  Just an abstract title, and not as much depth (IMHO) as Chess, so never really got a lot of play time from me.

After 5+ Plays: Need more plays to delve into the strategy, but this is surprisingly fun for an abstract.  The alternate win conditions (capturing 5 pairs of stones vs. 5-in-a-row) is what makes the game so interesting and unique.

A fast and interactive puzzle game.  the key to this one is using the special unit chits to their highest potential.  It can be a bit bit dull when every tower gets taken by tiebreak - basically ties go to the flag on the tower.

I picked it because I recognized it (probably from Tanga sales) and actually really enjoy playing it.  Has some problems, but is short enough that I am willing to forgive them and just enjoy it for what it is.

RATING: 7
Let's talk about poor Batt'l Kha'os. Two things here: 1) This is an abstract with a little bit of artwork on top 2) This is living proof that misbranding by a publisher can absolutely murder a fairly solid game. 

Batt'l Kha'os? Extraneous Apostrophes? Sold for 2.99 on Tanga for the past two summers? This should be the kiss of death for a game...and it really has been neglected. This is a real hidden gem. 

Batt'l Kha'os is a tile-laying battle abstract that has some superficial similarities to [thing=822][/thing]. Essentially, you're tile-laying to control majority around towers, which score you points. It makes some improvements on the Carcassonne system, though, as you're able to draw from the tile stack, or draw a face-up tile from a market, which gives you more agency (and even lets you pick sneakily to block!) over your new tiles in hand.

I first played this game in 2016 and was turned off by the essentially abstract system. But now, returning to it in 2018, I found the abstract system very engaging. There's a lot of strategy to the timing of taking towers, and like any two-player game, you want to make your opponent do all the work of surrounding a tower, while you swoop in and win it anyways. Similarly, once you've secured a certain win, [i]leave that tower alone[/i]. These sorts of tips are drop-dead obvious to abstract players, and I was able to appreciate the game after coming back to it with that background. 

A few magic elements of this game: every tile has both players' soliders on it, which forces you to make some tough decisions. Often you can waste an opponent's soldiers by dropping them in a place where they will be lost anyways. Similarly, the tile draw lets you hate-draft and pick tiles that are very strong in your opponent's soldiers -- tiles that you can waste! 

If the game were just tile-laying, it would be interesting, but Batt'l Kha'os does inject some interesting power swings through the special tokens that come to each player. These can be played with just the basic tokens, drafted by both players, or used to handicap a more experienced player. These tokens let you do anything from boost your soldiers by two, double the value of the soldiers on a tile, or even take two turns in a row. They remind me of the special tokens in [thing=3][/thing] that let you break the rules in subtle ways. 

There's more to this little abstract/two player game than you might have first expected when you look at the bland artwork and the unappealing packaging. Give this one another look!

As 2-player games go, this one is okay.  Game quality is very good.  It plays quickly enough and it scratches the itch for majority control.  The basic game can be a tad predictable when the players are equally skilled - it will tend to come down to who has tiles in hand that can be played without setting the other person up for the win.  The advanced game changes that because the board is no longer static once played, but it still depends heavily on the tile draws.  The game is close on several marks, but still falls a bit short on overall play.  Worth checking out and giving it a play.

2p tile placement game in the style of Carcassonne, Lobo, Fjords, etc. You alternate play, each tile has both yours and your opponents strength points, so you can't make much of a diference here. You also have "power tokens" and that's what makes the diference. In the end the board looks more like a math grid than a battlefield.

After a couple plays, I am not enamored with the game. I feel like there are just so many better games in the same weight and time frame.  But I also feel like I need to give it some more plays and time to sink in.  The idea is really cool, feels like Carcassonne but with combat.

The power tokens and the ability to place towers and break ties on towers, etc. make this a "game" as opposed to a tile-laying-time-killer.

I apparently don't know how to count, so I am terrible at this game. For some reason in this and other games like it (Gardens of the Alhambra, Wooly Bully) I just get creamed. I suspect that it's important to always try to set yourself up to be the one who scores a tile, which I never seem to be able to do. Whatever. It's pretty boring and repetitive either way. I'll probably only play this once or twice more before finding it a new home. At least it was cheap on Tanga.

This is a great game for kids who are looking for a battle game but aren't old enough to dive into too many rules about variable powers and special conditions.  Relatively quick tile-laying game where players fight for area majority around towers in order to capture enough towers to be the first to 7 points.  Easy to explain, great components, perfect for my 8 y.o. son (though I think younger kids would have no problem playing).  Looking forward to playing the advanced rules which don't appear to add too much complexity.  We really enjoy this game!

Like many small box games, it's a great value for the money.  The components are simple, but great.  Everything works nicely.

I've only played with the basic tokens and tiles along with the basic rules.  It plays fast.  I don't know how else to describe how the strategy feels, except to say that it feels like a complex game of tic-tac-toe. It's a race to control those corners around the towers.  If a tower matches your race (orc or human), then you merely have to control 2 of the corners and it's a done deal.  To make this happen, you have to at least attempt to anticipate your opponent's move; thus attempting to lead your opponent to play a particular strategy in order to counter yours is one side of it, and being on the receiving end of this is the other side.

I need to play with the advanced rules.  It looks like they'll spice it up a bit.

Interesting, but not interesting enough to really care about.

It's rather luck dependent, because if you get a bunch of tiles with lots of your guys on it, you'll likely win.  If not, you'll likely lose.  There is only so much room for tactical play.

I initially rated this an 8, but have lowered the rating slightly after a few games that seemed to be too much determined by luck.

Interesting little tile laying game which is more about trying to deny your opponent opportunities to claim corners than it is building forces to ensure you can claim corners. 

You must be able to analyse the board and pick the opportune moments to play the limited power tokens that you have. A badly played power token can cost you the game

Very close game with my opponent only a turn behind me in the race to 7 victory points. 

We only played the very basic game but there are components included to increase the options including special tiles and more power token options. I look forward to gradually adding these advanced pieces after playing the basic game a few more times

My husband and I give Batt'l Kha'os a combined rating of 6 after two plays of the basic game. The components are nicely designed and produced. The rules are clear and easy to remember. We played with mostly tactical moves, but we could see that strategic moves are possible. Play lasted the appropriate amount of time for the weight of the game. 

The game title is a misnomer--to us, the basic game does not feel chaotic or anything like a battle. However, we both enjoy tile-laying games, and this one did not disappoint us.

We will update our rating after playing the advanced game.

Nice idea, similar to something I wanted to do since the first time I played "Carcassonne". I really like the basic mechanic, but something went wrong during the transition from print-and-play to commercial release. I understand the reasoning for the different towers "belonging" to either player to avoid ties, but their collateral effect is that the fight for them too often ends too early, and it may be very hard to win an "opponent's" tower. I haven't played with the advanced tokens and special tiles yet, but it's easy to see that they just make the game more chaotic and unpredictable (in fact, the rules themselves say something like that). Curiously, the artwork is very reminiscent of the first two installments of the computer game "WarCraft" -  which had the same theme of Orcs vs. Humans - but quite uninspired and inferior to the original art of the print-and-play game.

Great little tile laying game. Capture the tower goal with a lot of randomness thrown in. You capture orc or human towers (four of them with points ranging from 1 to 3). First player to capture 7 points of towers wins. Plays a bit like multiple tic-tac toe. You need to keep your eye on multiple points of the board after the first tower placement and fight at different points otherwise it descends into a race (still not happened, but I imagine it could easily do so). You spend time outmaneuvering your opponent. Play the advanced game once you've had at least two basic plays. The extra five advanced bonuses are murder on an opponent. Extend the winning score to 8 or 9 points for a longer fight.

Wasn't what I expected. It comes on as a battle game but is really just a Carcassonne expansion. It seems once you make a big play with your power tokens at the right time your opponent is behind the 8-ball with no way out. Not impressed.

RATING: 6
Simple game of placing tiles with competing corner values. Players try to win a majority of corners around a tower tile into order to claim the points (1-3). First player to 7 points wins. Players are given 5 power tokens with one-time special abilities. Simple, clean design. The basic strategy is to try to position yourself to be the last person to place beside a tower. Towers are sided with one player or the other for tie breaks. Using special powers is a necessity to win any of the towers of your opponent.

Rating is the for the base game without the "advanced" tiles. I actually think the advanced tiles detract from the game by adding powerful abilities and an unwelcome element of luck. That version I'd rate a 4. I might play with the advanced power tokens, but only if both players played with the same set.

Not a terribly exciting 2 player game, but interesting enough to hold my attention.  Also, with the power tokens, there can be real surprises.  In one game, my son thought he'd had no chance as I was so close to winning, then he blocked one move and before I could recover (as all my eggs were in one basket), he had won!  Think it is a good strategy and tile placement introduction for even young ones.

Nagyon szórakoztató, kiváló kis kétfős öööö, mondjuk partijáték. :D Legalábbis én érzetre ezt mondanám. Lapkalerakás, ahol tulajdonképpen négy lapka által meghatározott sarkok dominanciájáért folyik a harc emberek és orkok között. Aki a tornyok négy sarkából többet uralnak, azé a torony feletti rendelkezés, ami pontot ér. Összesen 7 pontnyi tornyot kell elfoglalni, ekkor ér véget a játék.

Jó kis taktikai játék, amiben túl nagy mélységet nem kell keresni, de gyors, élvezetes, kimondottan hangulatos. Csak ajánlani tudom!

This is certainly not the war game that the box might fool you into believing. It's a majorities game, and quite an abstract one.

Essentially you're trying to get majorities at vertices, and then the most controlled vertices controls the towers for vps. The major twist is that there are 10 bonus tokens of various powers to modify play. 

It's a fun romp, and it's pleasing to the eye as well.

Tried playing with my son and I think there is a bit too much number crunching for him to do well quite yet. A somewhat clever minimalistic type game but not very exciting either.

Played 5-10 times. 

Update: We played twice after a 2-year hiatus. I´m probably not keeping this. It´s too much of a waiting game. There are too many pointless moves when you already know who will win a tower because of the tiebreaker. I can´t see us picking this game over all other games in the collection.

Theme was an instant hit with the 5-yo - as I knew it would be. I like the graphics and the gameplay, though I´m not sure I would pick this one to play with an adult. I can see this become an 8, at least when played with the boy.

Far too tactical and lucky to offer much entertainment. It plays similar to Carcassonne without being shorter or more strategic, and without 3- and 4-player flexibility. I'll choose Carcassonne every time.

After yet another crappy game played at BGG.Con '09, we decided to take a seat at the Z-Man booth and regroup. There was a cute tile-laying game sitting on the table in front of us, and Paul from Z-Man offered to give us a quick rules explanation. Serendipity!

We both really liked Batt'l Kha'os and it went right on our want list. We played the basic game, but looked up the rules for the advanced version and can't wait to get our own copy. As someone else commented, this is a tile-laying war game and you really don't see those too often!

Ignoring the marketing spin name and theme, the game ends up being a passive tile laying affair, with the Nim like feel reminding me of Samurai, but competing in squares rather than hexes. Each corner of each tile has 0-4 strength, yours or theirs. You're trying to win the castle tiles to get VPs. To do that you need to win a majority of a castle tile's 4 intersections, summing up the strength you've placed (ie in the 4 tile corners facing into that intersection). Neat and simple concept which works well. It's play 1, draw 1, working out where to place and orienting so the strength comes to bear in the right place. You don't want to be placing the second last tile to a castle intersection because it's likely your opponent will come over the top of you, unless you're already well ahead on the other intersections. The special tiles help overcome the delaying tactics this usually induces, making out-of-the-hat moves possible and providing something extra to think about and plan for. But I've never much cared for placement-delay type games, Samurai included, as it creates a sense of prolonged inevitability rather than tension induced goodness. And that's the feeling here as well. I can appreciate it's well done, but not my cup of tea.

this game needs work, but I think it can be fixed with some small house rules.  See my BGG revision under 'variants'.  With a few relatively minor changes, the game is quite interesting.

I had a $20 off coupon and basically bought this on a whim based on the artwork and the fact that it was Z-Man. I had vaguely remembered reading something positive about it on here but didn't remember much else. When I first went over the rules I thought the game would be too simplistic or that the mechanic of capturing corners wouldn't really work but after actually giving the game a try I am very pleasantly surprised. The more I play it the more depth I start seeing to the game. I'll need more plays to see if this eventually falls flat but for now I am really enjoying it. The artwork is bright and clean and (as a cartoonist myself) I totally love the cartoon artwork in this game. It's quick and light but interesting and easy to teach. You can't ask for much more for the price (especially since I got it pretty much free!)

I happen to love the theme of orcs and knights but I can see some people being turned off by it. I urge those people to give it a shot anyway if you like quick simple tile placement games. It's not a fantasy war game at all.

A decent tile-laying game for two players. The twist here is that the pieces have both your guys and your opponents on them. I'm just not sure that there is enough variety in the types of moves that you can make in order to really make this game something special, but it's certainly not bad to play.

Great 2-player duel, especially for Carcassonne Fans. We picked this up at random at game night at the store and now I want a copy. By laying tiles you try to place your armies so that you dominate and win the fought over towers, but everytime you place a tile you place opposing armies also(each tile always has both armies) so play wisely. Totally loved it, right up my alley.
In a way it is sad it is so underrepresented (might the name be to blame?), on the other hand it is nice for me and my sweetie to discover a new game together that we both seem to like equally.

This is a decently fun game.  But, I'm often left with the feeling that regardless of strategy, the luck of the draw is a heavy factor in the outcome.  I usually don't mind the luck factor in games, but it was frustrating to see that determine the winner in my games so far.

I will play probably play this again.

Ah, no. This game is such a mish-mash of mechanics and the theme is terrible. Orcs vs. Humans? Really? I thought Warcraft already exhausted the theme. This is a tile-laying area majority control for victory using single tile placement like Carcassonne except the diagonal areas are calculated for area majority over a tower piece. The game throws in  rule-breaking power-up tiles for additional flavor but the core of the game play isn't really enhanced. Not a good game and certainly one that I do not envision playing repeatedly (or even again!). I suggest heading over to the convent to run around with a bunch of nuns as a Moyersoen alternative.

Nearly sold this game, but glad we gave it another chance. It is area control with tiles. The special-power tokens make the game. They make it tense. Timing the play of a tower tile is also interesting.

RATING: 5
remember that game you play with grid paper, where you take turns drawing a line, and if someone completes a square they initial it (scoring a point) and get to take a bonus turn?  This is like that MOST of the time, without the bonus turn, but with special abilities and some luck thrown in.

It's not bad, and you are making relevant decisions, but I have no burning desire to play again.

Best 2 player short game of 2009, seriously. Made russian rules translation for it. 
Was waiting this game to be published, 'cause fast gameplay and simple, yet curios token rules make this game a winner. I'm not a fan of tile-laying games, I disliked Carcassonne when I played it first time. But this game ain't like Carcassonne. You don't farm, or build, or circle up your church. You fight!=) 
Well, one of two games that "made my year" this year=)

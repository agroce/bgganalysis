Fun, straight forward solitaire play with a  heavy dose of theme.  The system works well, and can be modified easily to adjust both the complexity and challenge.  Clearly a candidate for fan-generated content.

RATING: 7
Exciting solo game. Mechanics are straight forward. Only done the surface missions so far. Once I go into the Hive and the campaign the rating might improve further.

I am not usually a fan of solo games but this drips with theme and is tense. Most important decisions done before the mission begins so planning is important.

This one wins the competition "let's make the most illegible counters we can". It is purely solitaire and it is massively re-playable and customisable, it is though like solving puzzles all the time, and slow and its mechanics are a bit tedious (too much random counter picking - yes these freaking illegible ones). Tries to imitate Aliens and it succeeds up to a certain point but it is too mechanical and dry in the end. A plus if you are a sci-fi fan.

Initial Impression: I'm not sure I should be posting any impressions yet, as I have only 2 sessions under my belt and very mixed feelings about them. But here goes anyways. First of all, the components. Lock&Load Publishing has done a fantastic job of taking this previously print&play game and giving it the professional treatment. The counters are large, clear, and functional. The light cardstock for the mission cards, enemy cards, and rulebook cover, seems almost to be coated with a form of plastic. The fonts and flavor text are all thematic. That being said, I was a bit disappointed when I went to the designer's website and found an updated COLOR rulebook. Had the publisher added a bit of color to the official printing, it would have really made the production pop. I was worried that the game would play itself and to a certain extent it actually does. When playing with just the basic rules, the decisions are limited. However, things begin to open up when the optional and advanced rules are added. I've now begun a campaign and am enjoying the unit progression in the squad. There are some interesting strategic decisions about how to spend your XP and which way you want to develop your squad. I'm now eager to try the next mission and see what happens to my squad.

This was well worth my time for PnP, I am excited for the retail version, and will place a P500 order soon! This one slipped off my radar as many things have been in motion for me over the past 12+ months I first discovered this gem. The game offers good challenge with a special mix of hands on for me that keeps me busy and enthralled, and never bored or overwhelmed! That the scenarios are tough, and so immersive is of particular interest to me, this system lends itself well to some wicked good fun, this may become my first, solitaire need in my collection!!

It has, after looking over the rules again and getting another partial play in, I have taken the plunge and am now awaiting my order of this game, looking forward to getting to set up scenarios with the boxed copy Components and getting down to it!

There are more than two dozen plays on the PnP and over that many on the boxed set, they came when I was between a regular set table to lay it on,so they were not counted. I need to get better at counting plays...

Interesting concept that plays quickly and is mostly enjoyable. Got a little bored on Mission #1 when a stuck door and a bad series of draws left me stranded at the entrance of Building #2 for 20% of the entire game.

Solo game where the players takes a few squads of space infantry out on a mission.  Mechanically simple game where the player looks at the mission objective, then selects the best squad to achieve the objectives. From then on it's a simple cycle of drawing random number chits from the cup to advance across the mission map.   Numbers are also drawn to see if an event is triggered, usually resulting in a battle against the scenario enemies, which are resolved by more random numbers!  It's a nice, playable game that offers good narrative, but the chit pulling gets old fast.  There are advanced "hive" scenarios with random maps, as well as campaign rules - I didn't get that far. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I really wanted to like this game.  The theme and concept are cool and the production is very nice.  I gave the game a good chance, playing multiple times in campaign mode and investing a lot of time in making a cheat sheet and FAQ.  Ultimately though, I came to feel that the whole thing was too luck-based.  I think the issue is that combat is very deadly.  One round of bad chit pulls can destroy your entire squad.  You can work your way methodically through most of the mission unscathed, and them BAM you're dead.  

There is a lot of nice detail and flavor, but I'm afraid I find the central combat mechanism to be too frivolous to support all that.  This game really makes me want to cheat, or go play a video game instead.

Two solo games that I do still enjoy are Space Hulk Death Angel and D-Day Dice.  I think the difference there is that you're not going to get wiped out in a single turn.  You can see trouble coming and have ways to respond, and thus the game has a more satisfactory arc, win or lose.  

We will have to see how I feel about my Kickstarted copy of Last Frontier when it arrives - is it more Death Angel or Space Infantry?

I think this game is a nice effort and well done in many ways.  I can see how people of other proclivities than myself might enjoy it very much.

RATING: 7
I own the Lock'n'Load version of the game... so my comments are from that perspective. 

Plays a lot like DVG's Leader series of games, you gather your team together, the campaign links up similarly and even the experience upgrade system is similar.  The game does a good job to carry the theme, which is difficult as there really isn't anything more than a generic story backdrop, so bravo there.  The romp through the levels is quite interesting and there is a good amount of variation from mission to mission to keep things spiced up.  

If there is any downside that I can see, as with the leader series of games, the game may get monotonous with multiple plays, even with random elements like creatures, the random hive level, the mechanic is the same and there is a lot of luck involved.  I wouldn't say this game is very deep strategically nor tactically either, but what there is, is light and fun.  The game was very quick to learn and the rule book is quite good.

I can see that expansions through downloadable missions, future line of fire magazine inserts the game can be further refine and given even more options.  Another consideration is the price, I am not the most price sensitive guy, but the retail game is pretty expensive and that should also be taken into consideration.  

The components are fair, the maps are nicely printed, the tiles and counters are on the thin side (sort of like the first edition of "All about Zombies".), the rule book is black and white and the box isn't up to the old Avalon Hill Bookcase quality.  None of these really matter of course, but these are my observations.  

The artwork and graphics are very good and more than makes up for the average component quality though.  Really atmospheric here.  

Kudos to the designer for a fairly unique & solid solitaire game.

Excellent solo game with lots of replay options due to variable opponent forces, force configurations, as well as random factors.  Have yet to play with the campaign variant.  My one quibble is that the randomizer provided doesn't really hold up in a combat with 4+ player random numbers and more than 2-3 opponent random numbers, as there are almost no degrees of freedom.  The "optional rules" for using dice really should be standard.

Fun little solo game.  Theme seems like something between Starcraft, Starship Troopers, and The 5th Element, but the gameplay is solid.  Lots of drawing of numbered chits, but that doesn't really slow the game down and does work better than a dice (in this context).  Sometimes I have trouble with certain enemy types, but it is my problem.

I am a little disappointed with the quality of the components for the price, as the missions are printed on card paper and the rule book could do with some colour to make it easier to differentiate between the different chits.  Other than that the game played well and I can see there being plenty of variation when playing missions with the various squads and enemies available, but it does suffer from a bit of luck of the draw.  Despite that it is enjoyable.

I'm really liking this solo game!  Not only are there a lot of scenarios with various ways of playing them, but the potential for user-made content is very high, and I have already played a campaign that I made myself.
The designer has a character generator on his site:
http://zak965.it/spaceinfantry/index.html


I would have rated it even higher, but the rulebook is rather confusing in places. The designer has been answering questions on the forum and is working on a FAQ. With the clarifications becoming available, I have raised my rating to a 9.

[microbadge=1714]

[u]10-Sep-2016[/u]:  SI is a solitaire only, squad level, sci-fi action game.  You control a team of soldiers going on various missions of rescue and combat.  There are several different aliens with which you'll battle.  It's very thematic, tense, and bloody.

I had a lot of fun with my first three sessions, and I haven't even gotten into the "meat" of the game yet - advanced rules and campaign play. I like the squad building aspect here much more than I did in Thunderbolt - Apache Leader. The theme probably has something to do with that, but it's also simpler and easier for me to grasp.

The copy I have came with the mini-cards as a sub for the RN chits. I like the cards a lot. I didn't have an issue with the RN chits, but I was concerned about destroying them over time, always picking at them with my fingernail to get them out of the cup. The mini-cards are always in my hand...I never put the deck down. Just do a quick re-shuffle when needing to draw a new RN and it's all good.

While I haven't played in a while, this game is constantly in the back of mind as something I want to get back to and explore even further.

The game is great and also the theme..the basic problem is the luck factor....
I don't think that's even the slightest balanced between the stats of the players and the possibilities of the chits from the bag.
example the command ability of the commander...it's 4 and even if you achieve to get that you still need someone from your team to get atleast high enough to pass it with the +1 of the CP.

I think it was ment to be played as a campaign where after 100 games your team have the stats to make it possible.

I want my games to be difficult to beat but i have lost over 12 games out of pure luck......

I think the game needs a change of the stats and to modify the results of the chits...it's damn to lucky.

Tons of variety, cool campaign mode and even advanced and optional rules once you get good at the game. I do find it to be pretty luck driven, but it is reduced over time, especially once your units level up. Chits are a nice thickness. My only complaint is the paper thin maps and the inability to actually sort most of the counters, also the Random Number generator is used for almost everything. Not a ton of decision making to be had, and rather fiddly. It's a cool concept and fairly well executed, but I don't see this game rising above a 7.

The game played well enough and the manual was fine.  But I found it somewhat boring.  Move, do a skill check, do an event check, maybe fight a bunch of enemies, do the same thing.  Clock is ticking so get going.  

I didn't find the game had much atmosphere and the game didn't capture me with the play ability or theme.

RATING: 8
3 plays in and enjoying it so far. The two missions are playing slower than I had hoped, but I'm hoping that's because I'm still learning the game and playing using the advanced rules and some expansion rules as well.

What's to like so far:
:d10-1: Campaign play. Improve your troops over a period of time. A variety of ways to improve them: promotion, upgrade skills, give them a talent.
:d10-2: Mission planning. I seem to enjoy games in which I select some units of a larger total and outfit them for the particular mission.
:d10-3: Seems to be plenty of randomization to keep you guessing. Both games were of the same mission yet played out quite differently.
:d10-4: I enjoy the sci-fi theme. 
:d10-5: The combat mechanic, while seemingly mostly random at this point, is fun.
:d10-6: A variety of units with different abilities/stats.
:d10-7: I have the second edition/printing. It comes with the most up to date living rules. Yay!
:d10-8: Many different scenarios, enemies, and random hive mission tiles. 

What I don't like so much:
:d6-1: Seems heavy on the book keeping. I don't mind book keeping so much and take detailed notes with many of my solitaire games. This seems a tad heavier than I like. Maybe just because I'm still figuring things out. As for the method of book keeping, I find that writing things down is better for me than using all the administrative counters.
:d6-2: Storage. There are a myriad of counter types. And they have all sorts of varying symbols on either side. It makes it hard to sort. The game screams for a counter tray, yet the box is too small and the counter symbols mentioned above would impede a sensible organization. So I'll keep it all in the box in baggies.
:d6-3: The mission sheets should have been printed on heavy cardstock and possibly laminated. They feel more like heavy paper. It gives the game a cheap feel.

Overall the problems are fairly minor nitpicks. I don't see them impeding my enjoyment of this game in the future. I'm looking forward to playing more of this game over the course of a few campaigns.

Very good game. I like games that tell a story out of random encounters and this one does it very well. Combat resolves quickly (if you are using counters) and node tells a part of the story what happens along the mission.
Very interesting system.

RATING: 6
This is a nice little solitaire game that is very low complexity and plays quickly.  I like the overall theme and the mechanics are clever.  Played the PnP version and might pick up the now printed version because it has such a small footprint needed to play and a mission can be completed in less then 30 minutes.  

My only hesitation is the mission became monotonous and I was looking to end it early without waiting for the final results.  The only real decision making was the squad makeup, the mission itself was more like playing themed Yahtzee. Maybe playing the campaign might change things. Still its a clever solitaire game with a small footprint, quick setup and fast gameplay which appears to have a designer willing to add expansions. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The decision making was present enough to make the game interesting if there was a faster, less tedious method of determining all of the random results, but I felt like I was just mixing and randomly drawing tokens constantly. That aspect was too fiddly, and ruined the experience for me. As it was, it felt like I spent way too much time fiddling, and way too little time making meaningful decisions.

This is an excellent solo game that impressed me enough, to make a good robust copy. 

Although I still like it after all this time, I have moved on to other solo games, that offer a bit more variety. The missions are lacking in choice and there always seems to be a "Best" way of doing things. Although each of the Missions and enemies are different, their effect on game play is only minor. 

The LnL version may be better with its Mission generator, Campaign and other tweaks, but I am not prepared to take the risk.

Still haven't played the Advanced rules yet, but the game is a good exploration system.  Sometimes in-game there are few decisions, but knowing when to cut your losses and try something else can be an important factor in winning or losing.

This is a slick game! Looks nice, plays nice, prints nice. Need to get the mission maps laminated, as I can see the 110# cardstock I used getting worn out on this one. Great new addition to my lunch hour game collection.

An entertaining solitaire design that provides a nice narrative and good tension.

The gathering of your Squad and Resources at the start of play gets the game off to a great start. I also very much like having two defeat conditions - you are not only fighting the enemy, but also the clock.

The missions (there are 8 of them) are interesting and diverse, and the enemies (there are 6 of them) helps lend a hand to replayability (which is excellent). The strength of the enemies varies (e.g., the Dark Roots are extremely deadly).

The only hinderance are too many rules questions and things that could have/should have been explained better (one would have thought they would have been sorted out in playtesting of the web version?). 

Fortunately we have terrific support from the designer, including an updated PDF rule book.

Advanced, Hive, and Campaign options provide a tremendous amount of value to this package.

I seriously need to find an alternative to the chit pulling thing.  It's the only thing that turns me off to the game.

this looks very promising... and indeed it is....

really a cool game to play. new and innovative SOLO system, with some very nice twists in them!

I like it, especially when I want to play a short SOLO game...

The only drawback is that most of the choices are made in the preparation phase, and once the operations start, there are not so much choices to be made by the player.

LNL version. Very quick, very light. Decent components. Plays quick, and is very simple to learn. Nice quick game to throw in if you have a little downtime.

Initial rating, based on how much fun we had in the first run through. Could change. 

+s: Fast play, good variety, very tense
-s: Lack of visual appeal, remembering to put the numbers back into the Random Number Generator (might try with the optional, "Use a Die" rule).

You make all the decisions before the play. Meanwhile you only take counters or roll a die without nothing more to do. I don´t want to play this again.

Lock'n Load first edition. Space Infantry is a good low complexity solitaire game. The gameplay can get a little monotenous after a while and the game is fairly luck based. The chit-pulling mechanic works really well but I tend to get really tired of it. There can be such a thing as too much chit-pulling. Components feel a bit cheapish in my opinion. These things set a side, I'm still looking forward to playing more of this game and see what more it has to offer.

Great solitaire. Strategic, with a little push your luck factor but it's not a luck fest. Simple rules, well designed missions and several interesting advanced rules. It's a better version of Space Hulk Death Angel without dice, and tokens instead of cards. Good work.

LnL 2nd Edition + New Worlds Expansion.  So far loving the game, even though I'm getting my *ss handed to me!  Looking forward to figuring out the optimal team make up.  The designer's website is chockfull of goodness.  I can see myself pulling this one off the shelf for a while to come.  
Edit: traded away only due to the fact I have too many games..

For the price (FREE!!!) you just can't go wrong with this space squad based game.  Components are well planned and presented, rules are fairly easy to follow (check the forums for this game to get full interpretations from the designer and game testers), and the action is non-stop.  I am extremely surprised at the complexity of a game of this quality and it is being distributed freely.  Granted, solitaire games are few and far between, and I may just be touting something that is kind of unique these days, but I must say that I enjoyed putting it all together with color cut outs on posterboard backing from my local office supply and playing my first mission.  Of course, it is harder than it looks and that is the appeal.  A solitaire game that challenges and engages the solo player so he/she can get their fix of boardgames is hard to come by and this is a great example of the medium!!!

Very disappointed in this game.  Not engaging, luck dependent, few meaningful decisions, etc.

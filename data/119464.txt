Plays just like Animal Upon Animal, but adds a balance board that rotates around in a circle.  It's probably the next step up in complexity for this game.

RATING: 5
Components: Nice chunky wooden animals, each in an interesting, stackable shape. The variety of pieces makes for an interesting visual.

Experience: The stacking is fun. Not much game here for kids. The die, rotation, and animal sounds don't seem to add much. Might be better if animals were just drawn randomly from a bag, or with some mixture of choosing one and having an opponent choose one for me.

Animal stacking dexterity game played on a lazy susan.

Component issues - the hemisphere doesn't work at all since the rotating plate isn't round. It will never balance or wobble as it's meant to. It just leans at an angle with one side dragging. Dumb choice. 

Otherwise ok, but adds very little, if anything, to the original.

My favourite of the Animal upon Animal games. We play with house rules to balance the die rolls: (i) Play two animals (ii)Play one animal; Rotate 360 Degrees (iii)Play one animal; Turn the Shark (iv)Play one animal; Rotate to the next buoy (ii) Pass one animal.

If you are finding that you're rotating more than playing animals, try this out.

The spinning mechanic is a little interesting, but not that well executed. This has two improvements that make it my favorite Tier Auf Tier of the four I've played, though: 

(1) All animals are unique, making for a fun draft at first and actual decisions about which two to keep when you suffer a huge collapse.

(2) There's no "make the base bigger" side on the die" to make the game too easy.

I might just make this set of animals the one I play all games in the series with.

While I do enjoy the new animal types and the addition of rotation to the animal-stacking antics of Animal Upon Animal, I do miss the ability to extend the base found in the original - that kept the pace of the game varied. The biggest problem, however, is that two of the six possible actions found on the die that determines a player's action result in placing no animals. It's not only bad competitively, but I've played a game of this where I didn't get to place a single animal - where's the fun in that?

Perhaps with some adjustments to the game's actions, this could be a great entry in the series. As is, I'll stick with the original.

Tier Auf Tier on Steroids!  It might actually be too hard for kids.  The addition of bigger animals and the unstable, rotating board really ramps up the difficulty.  I like it alot.  This is not a replacement for Tier Auf Tier but more like an Expert Edition.  Oh, and the animal sounds or penalty pieces is delightfully evil....

one of the best haba games.  i think this is even better than the base animal upon animal.  stacking up on the croc is fun.  highly recommended as a childrens game.

I was kind of excited about the lazy susan that came with the game, but after playing with it I realize that it adds a layer of instability to a game that doesn't need more. The fact that the whole thing will topple if someone bumps that the wrong way makes it feel cheap.

The whole thing is slightly elevated as well, so it tips easily. All told, I was a little disappointed with the game.

The reason I got the game was simply for more pieces to add to Animal Upon Animal, and it's a mixed bag on that front as well; The new pieces are unique, sturdy and interesting. The pig with its sloped back, the bumpy kangaroo and camel, the tiny frog, the moose with its ridges, the mountain goat. All neat. There are some duplicates as well, but that's not the end of the world.

Problem is, the game comes with only 1 of each animal. We'll just have to change Animal Upon Animal to everyone drafting. Lack of research on my part. 

Then again, I just want more animals for the base game, so I'm likely not the usual customer for this one.

Animal Upon Animal with a moving board. You must move the board to the next player in order to end your turn. Wow, is this so hard or what!? The animals are all crazy sizes and shapes and have different weights to them. You draft all your animals at the beginning but wowz! We were playing on the easy version there is a HARD version with the round ball base and geepers that must be insane! I can't wait to try it!  All in all not my favorite dex game but I would play anytime.

RATING: 5
The weakest of the Animal upon Animal games. The rotating base is either a non-issue (if you use the flat one), or makes it way to hard (if you use the round one). And making the animal noises get old fast.

RATING: N/A
A step too far, I think. I generally side with simplicity over cruft and busyness and overengineering, and the lazy susan aspect of this is overengineered.

RATING: 3.5
Animal upon Animal "variant". All the animals are unique in this one and some are really big and hard to position (which is good). The whole thing is set up on a circular board which you must occasionally turn around risking everything falling down while you try to make animal sounds. 

As stupid as making animal sounds sounds (er), it works. Kinda odd, but not out of place and sets up the atmosphere. The whole circling thing and having tough animals asks for some skill and patience - making the game probably better for adults than for kids, even though some things seem kinda childish. Base game is more accessible and that's why it's good. This one I see working more as a party game for teens and students (with latter perhaps becoming a drinking game?).

A great addition to this game system. No two animals are identical and there is an interesting distribution system at the start. No more stacking animals next to the crocodile! And the you have to rotate the platform on which the pyramid stands. Great game!

1 play, 2er

Like the original game, except:
- new animals, in wide variety of sizes
- play onto a spinning platform. There are 2 options: a half sphere (the one we used), and a flat disc.
- roll a die to determine what to do: place 1 or 2 pieces, give someone else a piece to place, change the direction of rotation, or rotate a full 360 degrees
- as you spin the platform, make animal noises for the animals you spin past.
- when you spill pieces, take 2 at most (the rest are removed from the game)

There are a lot of problems here:
- The half-sphere is WAY TOO UNSTABLE, making the game quite difficult (especially when you have to rotate the platform all the way around!). 
- That die roll: so ANNOYING when you keep rolling the full turn!
- Making animal noises: not that much fun!

Another nice animal upon animal game with a lazy susan type mechanic.
We play you must always place one animal if you roll the shark fin or have to turn the wheel.

One of the best kid friendly games - I love it. Some added complexity in this over the original - but not too much to detract from the experience.

Similar to Tier auf Tier. Adds a carousel, which is rotated after stacking an animal.

Tier auf Tier: Jehtz geht's rund! is fun, but perhaps not as fun as prior games in the series.

[b]Things I Don't Like:[/b]
- Rolling a shark fin or the 360 degree spin icons don't allow you to actually stack an animal. Along with the Hand, that translates into a 50 % chance of not getting to stack an animal on your turn.
- The animals don't have painted faces or outlines as in prior games.
- There is just 1 of each animal, instead of 4.
- The bit about saying animal sounds as you spin the board is just kind of silly.

[b]Things I Like:[/b]
- Spinning the board without toppling the animal tower is fun, and in this game everything has to be stacked on top of the crocodile, so the pyramid is certain to come down eventually.
- Different numbers of animals per player depending on the number of players in the game (9/7/5 animals each for 2/3/4 players).
- The animals are varied sizes and widths and all unique (although there are some repeats from prior games in the series).

I find this the weakest title in this series, but perhaps my opinion will increase with future plays.

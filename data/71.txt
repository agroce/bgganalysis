Played loads when I was younger but a recent playing made me realise just how much game design has progressed. It wasn't the length of the game itself that put me off but just the repetitive nature. You do the same thing every turn just building up your civilisation until it get hits by a disaster and then you start again. The rating is really down to how fondly I remember it because if I was basing it on my playing now, it would be a 4

This is the Avalon Hill version of Civilization which is by far my favorite Civilization game of all time. It does not see the table often simply because of the lack of concentrated time and the number of players needed. Looking at finding another way to play this game amongst friends. I also have Advanced Civilization, the Civilization Western Extension Map and Civilization Expansion Trade Cards Set. I would never break up this set and it would take a tremendous offer to cause me to part with it.

Over-zealous maths trading acquisition though realised that I will probably never play it due to the large playing time and the number of players required. Oh, to be a student again!

RATING: 8
This game is really as good as all the people say. The gameplay works well and is easy enough. The only complaint I have is that the last few turns to reach the end game condition make the game a little too long. People are just calculating what they need to win and the game is decided by trading (like the whole game is almost decided by your trading skills) while those turns aren't really entertaining.

can be extremely fun or long and boring, depending on how the players react to calamities. Adding a 5 or 10 minute timer for trading speeds the game up and increases the fun.

I just love the civilization building theme (thanks to Sid Meier). Civilization has some of the same athmosphere as its PC counterpart, but the game just drags on too long for what it is. I think that can't be helped if you wanted a decent civilization game, but here you have too much waiting and not enough to do.

RATING: 8
One of my all time favorite gsmes. I would rate this higher if there were any chance of playing it.

This was my mainstay game from middle school through college.  I loved discovering how my civilization developed in response to the others' gameplay.  There were many long nights devoted to the game.  The only drawback was that there usually came a point where the leader was decided before the time track was complete, and finishing the game after that point was more a test of will than a testament to quality gameplay.  Now, it is just too long.  I am older and value my sleep way too much.

Un juego perfecto: tienes libertad total para desarrollar tu civilización como quieras.
Todo está perfectamente representado a través de un conjunto de reglas fáciles y directas: desde el equilibrio rural y urbano de tu civilización a su inflación, pasando por el monopolio o los engaños en el comercio.
Tiene una curva de aprendizaje suave, ya que empiezas jugando en la primera edad de piedra con solo una ficha de población, y poco a poco vas creciendo, explorando, construyendo ciudades y barcos y desarrollando tu civilización dándole la forma que quieras.
Tengo una versión casera del juego, usando piezas de madera.

Perfect game: you are totally free to develop your civilization the way you want. 
Through an easy and streamline set of rules everything is here represented, from your civilization rural and urban balance to its inflation, or monopoly and backstabbing in trading.
It has a slow learning curve also, as you start playing on the early stone ages with just a population token and begin slowly to grow, explore, build cities and ships and develop your civilization shaping it on many diferent ways.
I have a homemade version of the game, using wooden bits.

Interesante, divertido, inesperado, entretenido, rápido, absorvente. Uno de los mejores juegos que he probado nunca. Solo jugábamos tres, pero nos llevó 10 horas acabar la partida y hasta casi el último minuto no se sabía quien poddía ganar y quien perder. Espectacular. Creo que es muy recomendable jugarlo con tiempo y con cuantos más jugadores más divertido. No defrauda nada de lo que te hayan comentado. Sencillamente espectacular (incluso para aquellos como yo a los que la historia Antigua no les atrae).

This is the ultimate Eurogame that is both simple and deep in strategy.

Makes me feel that I'm really 'growing' the empire.

Some feels that the game play is long, but if you don't have the time to play .....then don't play boardgames at all.

I have played it numerous times, and the game never fails to bring that satifaction when you are near the end race.

I have owned this since I was about 10, but have not played it for years. Actually I should not perhaps claim to own it, since I'm not sure where it is right now. (I presume it's in a box somewhere either in my basement or at my parents' house, but I have yet to locate the box!) Also, many of the pieces have gone missing (I know this because while I haven't located the game, I have found a bag with pieces from a number of games, including this one). Furthermore, since no one ever wanted to play it except my mother and myself, and since it's not a good 2-player game, I have never played this as it should be played. Typically my mother and I would each take several nations, or I would play it solo as a kind of alternate history. Still, I thought it was the most fascinating game I owned long before it became a "classic." So I rate it a 10. If I ever find it, and find the pieces, and find people to play it with me, I will leap at the opportunity!

Used to be my favourite game years ago. There are still many things I find very enjoyable about Civilization. But since it's almost impossible to finish this game in one day you almost never get to play it until the end. The first part of the game is also more fun then the last part as the increasing size of the civiliations also significantly slows the gameplay.

A bit long game - 8 hours with full set of players. Very fun nothing the less. Get Advanced Civilization. The base game seems a bit limited to my taste (not enough resource card), plus the advancement is a bit limited. The trading part is the most fun, really sound and feel like a market-place/stock market trading.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This game is so innovative, it gets a 10 despite the flaws in this gem:

"Pit" experts will RULE this game, all other aspects, phases, skills (etc., etc.) be damned! (Excluding such a player from participating will improve the game exponentially, and that's harsh for a number of reasons.)

Commodities on Trade Cards are more suited to Eurogame designs.  I made new cards with more historically accurate commodities.

Time to play: so ridiculously long, I've NEVER seen a game last to the end (and I've played it many times); each game was simply scored by who was ahead when enough players tired of continuing.

Go to the top of the class. I'm not easily impressed, but this did it for me. Yes it can be a long game, but you don't want to hurry through this, or you miss much of the flavour. For those people who are concerned about 'mucking up' in the first few turns and falling behind, it's easy to knock up a few crib sheets to remind you what you should be doing for each country to get it up and running. 
All that aside, still one of my all time favourites.

When you add the AdvCiv extension it becomes 10. In AdvCiv you have a chance to catch up if you fall behind in one turn or two. Not so in Civ. You MUST advance every turn on the AST to achieve a win in Civ, not in AdvCiv. Hence:
AdvCiv 10
Civ 8

Civ is still one of the best and most innovative game systems ever. It is a very good game. I do recommend it whole-heartedly.

A great but very long game of trading across the mediterranean.  Does not work well with people who do not understand that trading at a small loss still puts you up on the rest of the table.  Can be very tedious if people decide to start an intense war, which is usually to the detriment of everyone involved.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
One of my favorites - the advanced version. Can be played either aggressively or passively - war is possible but not recommended unless necessary. With the calamities and other game mechanics, no player is really too far behind - with civil war, for example, it takes the strongest player down and benefits the weakest player to balance things out. Good player interaction with trades. Simple to learn. Only downside is that it takes time to play (several hours).

RATING: 7
PROS:
*) No luck in the strict sense (dice, etc.)
*) Requires longterm planning
*) Very rewarding to play (nice feeling of expansion, achievement, etc.)
*) Can be played with many players (even more with Western Europe Expansion)

CONS:
*) Scoring seems somewhat flawed, but it may be a mistake on our part. The main point of this game is playing, not winning, really.
*) Extremely long - hard to find a group that bites through.
*) Not balanced for all player counts - I would recommend only 6/7 players (more variant when using western expansion)

10/29/17: Would be interesting to play this again after I've played mega civ.  This has the advantage of being shorter.  With more players and more time, would probably default to megaciv.  Rating lowered to a 4.

2014: Love this game with the right group of people and an open evening to give it a play.  Game does not get a higher rating based on the time requirement of 6-7 hours to give it a full play and the difficulty of rounding up the right number of people.  Be sure to read my review of the Western Expansion Map of Civilization for more information.  This map helps tremendously for balancing the boardgame for larger numbers of people.

Own the 2nd edition.

5: Rating for playing with anyone other than Jon and Nate.

RATING: 7
Nagyon jó játék (méltán az egyik leghíresebb a '90 előtti időszakból), amelynek legnagyobb hibája a hossza!! A szabálymagyarázat 1 órán belül megvolt, a tiszta játékidő viszont 5 óra felett volt 3 fővel úgy, hogy ha végigjátszottuk volna, még legalább 3-4 órán át tartott volna. Szerencsére vannak rövidítési lehetőségek, mi éltünk is ezzel... A durva az, hogy 7 játékossal legalább duplájára becsülöm a játékidőt, mivel a legidőigényesebb fázisok (mozgás, csapások megoldása) nem szimultán történnek.

De hogy ne csak a hosszáról írjak: egy 1980-as játékhoz képest szuper, még mai mércével nézve is jó! A játék közben felvetettem, hogy emlékeztet a Dominant Species-re (vagy inkább az erre) több tekintetben, és ezt más is megerősítette, aki próbálta mindkettőt. A hasonlóság nem a mechanizmusban keresendő, hanem a folytonos változásban, ami miatt senki semmiben sem lehet biztos, a térképen körről körre teljesen más lehet az erőviszony. A dominantban állatfajok vesznek el és bukkannak fel a semmiből, itt pedig városok és lakosok. A hirtelen nagy változások okai mindkét játékban: brutálisan erős kártyák. A különbség: a Dominant species egy szerintem tökéletesen kidolgozott játék, nincsenek kérdések, gyenge pontok, és külsőre is jobban megfelel a mostani igényeknek.

Konkrétumok: mindenki egy ókori népet irányít, és az időjelzőn (~fejlődésjelző) lépked előre körönként legfeljebb egyet, aki előbb célba ér, az nyer. Jópofa, hogy minden népnek kicsit mások a feltétlek (más kezdőhely, más végefeltétel, más korszakhatárok, sorrendben elfoglalt hely stb.), és tetszik a pontszerzési rendszere is a játéknak: kincstár+kereskedelmi+civilizációs kártyák is adnak pontot. A kereskedelmi áruk kombói (lásd képlet) nagy változatosságot adnak: egy önmagában olcsó áru is lehet értékes. A civilizációs kártyák vásárlási rendszere is jó, nem nagyon láttam máshol hasonlót, és elég ötletesek maguk a kártyák is. Az igazi specialitás pedig a 8 csapáskártya, amik arra szolgálnak, hogy teljesen felborítsák a pillanatnyi helyzetet: ez csupa nagyon eredeti szemétkedős lap, amik miatt soha senki sem lehet biztonságban. A fő csavar az, hogy néhányat ezek közül is el lehet kereskedni (maga a kereskedelmi mechanizmus egyébként szintén tetszik), így pl. járványt zúdítva valamelyik riválisra, aki jóhiszeműen prémre vagy szövetre számított tőlünk. A játék több okból is nagyon konfliktusos, érzékeny emberek kerüljék. A harci rendszer logikus. Ami még tetszik, hogy 2-7 ember játszhatja. 
Ha a 8 csapáskártya nem lenne, akkor inkább stratégiai játék lenne, de ezek miatt kőkemény taktikai játék!
A játék enyhén nyelvfüggő, de mindent lefordítottam. A nehézség nem vészes, a segédlet elég jó!

A hosszán túl a hibák: mai szemmel már nem mondanám kifejezetten szépnek. Többiek panaszkodtak a tokenek méretére is, de én Itáliában voltam főleg, ahol nem volt gondom a hellyel. A görög rész tényleg elég zsúfolt, de pl. a Diplomacy-hoz képest még így is jó a helyzet. A csapás kártyák elég királycsinálók tudnak lenni, de talán épp azért ilyen hosszú a játék, hogy kiegyenlítődjenek a dolgok. A miszticizmus kártya feleslegesen túl erős szerintem. Emellett elméletben lehetséges, hogy valaki végleg kihal a játékban (ehhez persze nagyon buta dolgot kell csinálnia: hajót építeni utolsó két táblán lévő emberével).

A játék Magyarországon szerintem méltánytalanul van hanyagolva, aminek a riasztó hosszán kívül az lehet a fő oka, hogy mivel utoljára több, mint 20 éve adták ki, még külföldön is kevés van belőle, egyszerűen nem elég ismert. Ha az egész napomat 1 játékra kellene ellőni, szívesebben játszanám a Through the Agest, mint ezt, mégis azt mondom, hogy aki szereti a civilizációsakat, vagy csak a komolyabb játékokat úgy általában, annak kötelező darab legalább egyszer, hisz tele van csupa jó ötlettel, nem a manapság unalomig elcsépelt mechanizmusok köszönnek vissza benne! Akit érdekel, szóljon:) Piatnik meg kiadhatná újra:)

Eszembe jutott még egy dolog: mivel a térképen nem folyamatosan növekszünk, hanem gyors kezdeti felfutás után hektikusan változik a lakosságunk és városaink száma (akár 0-ra is lecsökkenhet hirtelen 9-ről), ezért a pontszerzés nem lódul meg a játék közepe felé sem, inkább lineárisan növekszik a pontszámunk, ezért tart sokáig a játék.

An excellent balanced civ game, that amazes me. The mechanics were way ahead of its time and most of the contemporary civ games have copied them, like roll through the ages in the resources counters. The game is very enjoyable, comparable to modern civ games. I find it better than, say, sid meier's civ 2010. I would like to invent a trade variant rule to decrease gameplay time. It is a great game, very balanced, with non-brutal area control. Try it if you don't mind the archaic components.Another thing that increases game time is the constant conflict and movement, perhaps a if the attacker had to sacrifice something in order to attack the game would be less chaotic and with substantially smaller gamelength.

Very well balanced game, but it takes a lot of time to play. The map could be some bigger (dutch version), and the disasters are a big disadvantage for players who are in trouble. Once I suffered from a disaster and I started to recover I got again 2 disasters who made me loose all my cities. Without them, I could have a little chance to come back in the game.

[b]Advanced Civ[/b]
We play with 5-minute trading phases.  You should know that I hate Traders of Genoa and Settlers of Catan, so a time limit on trading is the way to go.  As for the actual trading, I find it a little random and also less exciting than others make it out to be.  "Do you have Spice?  No.  Do you have Cloth?  No.  OK, next person.  Do you have Spice?  Yes.  Good, what do you want?  I want Resin.  I don't have that.  Oh, next person."

As for the Advancement cards, I find them to be nothing more than acquiring points.  Most of them seem to lessen calamities and provide credit for purchasing other Advancement cards at a reduced price.  I guess I was expecting more variety and progress such as in Through the Ages.  Overall, I find Advanced Civ to be a little outdated, fairly repetitive and waaay to long... but keep in mind that I have really high expectations.  

[b]Civilization[/b]
I have not played basic Civ yet.  I happen to love Revolution: Dutch Revolt (same designer) so I am eager to play the orignal version.  My gut instinct tells me that I'll enjoy it more than Advanced Civ.  We shall see.

Update:
Now that I've played basic Civ I have absolutely no interest in playing vanilla or Advanced Civilization ever again.  Usually 1 or more players fall behind early.  This basically means spending the next 3-8 hours in a losing position.

RATING: 8
Too long for the level of complexity. The game is mostly about recovering from the frequent disasters and maintaining a good number of cities in play, along with supporting farmers, to reach the highest levels of trade. Importantly warfare does create room for growth at the expense of your opponents. The city surrender rule is the prize in war, since it gains you a city and costs your opponent one. Next is killing their supporting population so they are forced to reduce cities, and secondly it is raiding city attempts to make them fail. Contrary to common belief, aggression can pay in Civ.

Update: Further plays have increased my appreciation of the design.

Aside from the length, I really enjoy this.  The last two times I've played, I've been able to play with almost a complete cohort of opponents.  Does this take time?  You betcha, but OH what a time.  Everyone has a blast.  Empires rise and fall, and the competition is jovially fierce.  I wish I had the time, and a consistent number of opponents who did also, to play this more often.  Since I've only played Civilization, I don't know what I'm missing in Advanced Civilization, but at the price it's going for on Ebay, and the fun I have with the original, I'll stick with what I have for the time being.  [Thrift $1.99 unpunched x2!  Gave one to a friend.]

At GenCon South the year prior to this game's release, it just seemed like something was lacking.  In the main convention hall, there was a wide variety of games and playtesting spread across the room.  Every table contained its own narrowly-focused group, concentrating on mostly obscure (and frankly, not a lot of fun) games. The Risk tournament I joined was torture. The folks playing miniatures and D&D showed the most excitement.  One year later, change was in the air--GenCon South was a sea of Civilization boards.  The excitement was contagious, something groundbreaking was happening and everyone knew it. Once I taught this game to my Diplomacy playing friends, it was a breath of fresh air. Glad to see from the reviews how well it still stands in the gaming community.

An amazing game, probaply the best game I have ever played. But it has it's flaws, mostly in the metagame area: you need roughly 14h (with 1 lunch break) to play and 7 players willing to spend whole day playing. Explaining the rules to newbies takes me about 45 minutes. And after one game you don't even want another try in a few months even if you had a chance. So I can't give it a full 10, even though I have yet tp see another as well balanced game and as good way to loose track of time. 
Epic. And like a friend of mine said: any board game that takes under 12 hours is casual :P

Haven't played Civilization for a long time, I had to find out, that time has passed.

Therefore, I had to reduce my rating.

A strange relic from a publisher and an era better known for complex rules and an obsession with "realism," many of Civilization's critical mechanics possess a kind of elegance that make it feel like a modern Euro.  A single play-through will kill an entire day (and then some), it desperately needs some player aids to help you remember various details, the calamities will continually send you into the rulebook, and the technology tree in the mid-late games requires a spreadsheet; despite all that, it's a GREAT old game.  It's engaging as hell.  It self-balances as well as anything I've ever played, and unless you suffer from either spectacular bad luck or psychotic neighbors, your civilization can bounce back from damn near anything.  If you're willing to invest the time, well worth a look.

Very meaty game game with great depth. It's rather complex though and seems to take forever to complete. Still a classic and innovative design when placed in it's timeframe. The "basic" version is enough for me. No desire to try the "advanced" version. It's just very ugly for todays standards.

After gathering dust on my shelf for almost 25 years, I finally got rid of this.

Heavy games are for heavy gamers and I don’t regard myself one of them: a couple of hours of playing a single game amply sets the limit for me; everything taking longer looks intimidating and proves frustrating. 

Nonetheless I'm playing Civilization eagerly because it's a solid and - despite its endlessness - even fun game: I’ve never thought modern games are better than old games and as a matter of fact Civilization is a sound example of how a thirdy-and-more-year-old game can be much more enjoyable than many of the recently-published ones.

Nonetheless, it’s far from perfect, as both its lack of dice and inclination to foster AP clearly show: AP-prone players feel kind of allowed to take their time to think and plan and think again for ages. Which can be enervating for those who are used to play on impulse and, after doing their moves quickly, then have to wait and wait and wait idly before each phase (and every turn) is completed: yet, even so, Civilization can be fun; and poking the AP-buddies is even more.

Played back in the mid-eighties.  Loved it.

One that if someone planned it and started early enough, I would play again.

Played 9/08 - It was what I remembered it to be, if not better.  The game is always moving.  Hell, looked at the clock and we had been playing for five hours but it seemed like 45 minutes.  It really is, starting in mid-game, about managing calamities and getting though those as well as possible.  Game took us 10 hours with six.  We could have shortened it if we had a timer for trading, but really, it worked out fine.

Aug 2010 - played it four times now.  Wasn't nostalgia.  Awesome game and we make an effort to play it every six months or so.  Have a set group of at least five who will play and plan a Saturday around the game.  Bumped my rating up to a 10.

What do I say to do justice to the game that defined my childhood? The day-long experiences we had playing Civilization were intense, strategic affairs that involved negotiation, long-term planing, careful decisions about technological advancement, and my first lessons in backstabbing. Civilization manages to be a game which is at once carefully scripted in the rise and fall (and rise) of great empires, yet feeling completely open even single time. The weakness of the game only becomes apparent when you play it with the same people over and over and over again, as I did with my family. Still, I'd be happy to bring this out with a new group of players and see how things develop.

This is Civ and Advanced Civ - all in a heavily used Civilization Box (Might be the Advanced box I can't remember).  There are like two or three of each civilization population counter missing, otherwise complete.  The cards are pretty worn but I have since laminated them so that they will not reach further degradation.  This was the well used copy I have been playing with since 1981.

Again all the cards (trade and Civilization) have been laminated (I think the stock sheets as well).  The Advanced box has disintegrated away from heavy use, and The Civilization box the game resides in has been heavily Taped to keep it from falling apart.  If you are looking to play the game this is the copy for you.  If you are looking at this as a collectible - I would shy away!!

A game with 31 years that is fresh and doesn't feel old at all only can be considered a masterpiece.

The only reason why I rate it 9, instead of 10, is because it's almost impossible to play it live due to the 10 hours duration.

This is clearly inferior that Advanced Civilization but as long as the expansion can not be in the rankings I support the basic game because this game+expansion has to appear in the top100.

Truly a great game. Awesome negotiation rounds, interesting logistics (due to cleverly drawn borders), very good technology uses (even if the technology tree is poorly implemented components-wise). I'd buy the reprint, if it ends up being made.

Somehow I think the game could be shortened. I don't think this would feel that short at 4 hours (unlike Die Macher, which I think would few short if you cut 50% off the game).

By the way, I played this with the Advanced Civ expansion, and from what I've heard from the owner of the game I'd rather keep using it indefinitely. Limited civ advance cards is just too silly for me.

Too long and too easy to get left behind (unable to achieve the minimum victory points).  The trading mechanic is neat, but it is harsh in two ways (1) disaster cards can get ugly and (2) it often takes multiple turns to build up enough money to buy advances (especially with 6 or 7 players where there's lots of shouting and inevitable competition with them for the same goods).  It's scary how trading disaster cards to a game buddy affects the meta-game; it's guaranteed that some players will hold a grudge for months or years into the future.

Ok! I would not play Civilization nowadays. I think it was a fantastic game in the 80's. But with 7 players you could very well be absolutely trashed by the beggining of the first hour and have to see your friends play for another 8. The mechanics have gotten so much better in these 35 years.... I give it a honorary 7, though

A classic game that spawned many an hour of computer game fun.  Personally find the classic board game version plays too long and too unforgiving if you make a misstep early on in the game.  12 hours is a brutal stretch of time to be suffering for a misstep in your first hour of play.

Did enjoy it in the day, but do not like it enough these days to play again

RATING: 6
Played this one a lot in the early 80's. Prefer it to the Advanced version as I think the advanced game makes calamities too important (and I like the mathematical trading - if you want to trade a calamity you have to give away good cards with it to 'hide' the fact you're giving a card worth zero). Now days game length means I doubt it will ever be played again :(

** Update, now traded my AH version, but still have the gibson one, so maybe another play, one day ...

We played this game to death back in the day.  Was for a long time my favorite game. Its one major failing was there being zero chance of getting back in the game if you ever fell behind on the AST track... and the most likely time you would be set back on it was very early in the game.  So if if happened you were in for 4 plus hours of play time knowing you could only be a spoiler.  Once History of the World came out, it scratched the same itch and didn't suffer this issue... so Civ got shelved forever.

(> 20 plays) This game has been my first "serious" game (way back in the 80s) and I blew my away then! It still is very good (although the endgame often is very static and prone to card collecting). It takes 6 or 7 maniacs willing to sacrifice a weekend to this game, but then you will have a great time. Just make sure that you have the right people around you else you will be sitting at the table with some not-so-nice guys/gals for a very, very long time!

RATING: 5
I like the tokens multi-utility: From being points, to being troops, to being currency, etc... having to balance everything was interesting. The rules on the whole were streamlined and interesting - alongside the asymmetric starting positions.

However, the game is entirely too long and has tons of downtime. I'm also not a fan of the red calamities. Not only do they seriously add onto the downtime late game, they're random, convoluted, and not player controlled - so you just feel frustrated at the game, rather than annoyed at another player. It feels like there should be no red calamities, and more black calamities.

With longer games, its how invested you feel. The first two hours is build up, and the downtime gets worse and worse as you go on. It's not a tight game, so players in a losing position stay in a losing position. I think there's much better games than it now... but this would've been awesome as a kid.

A great game, but not for the faint of heart. Be prepared to play for the better part of a day, with a game lasting 8+ hours not out of the question.  Civ is a game of skill, there are no dice, though there is luck-of-the-draw in regards to trade cards.  With just a hint of Diplomacy, you will find that Civilization is a game unlike most other board games, which is a good thing!

I first played this game in 1987 when I was 14 and it was my favorite for many years. Best with 5 or 6 players in my opinion. 4 is decent but much better if you have the Western expansion map as that creates a more balanced four player game. Advanced Civilization made the game much longer, better for 7-8 players, and opened up the trading to make it more fast and hazardous. I recently picked up Mega Civilization which helps remove many of the flaws of Advanced Civilization. I highly recommend the original as you really can't go wrong unless you play two players which is somewhat broken.

Classic civilization-building game, made even better with the 'Advanced Civilization' expansion.  Haven't played this in ages.  Verrry long game (10-11 hours, average).

RATING: 9
A classic. Still a wonderful example of game design - with the competing tensions between expansion and available resources built into the game components themselves.  Also an masterful exercise in introducing a fairly complex rule set, very naturally, a stage at a time - while in theory you play all the phases of a turn right from the very start nearly all are ignored for the first few turns, with extra phases activating as your expanding empire brings new possibilities - which makes it a lot easier to teach than you'd imagine from the rule book.  A long game - much more so than fashionable these days - but it still racked up a lot of plays over the years.  And, to be fair, our long time habit of only starting after closing time bears a lot of the blame for some pretty lengthy games.  It's a tribute to its qualities that it was always lined up for the next session anyway.

This leviathan needs no introduction. Sure there were good games around before this one, but this game raised the bar. The 'epicness' of this game is only matched by the time it takes to play! The mechanic of the technologies, which are arranged in a tree of advancement (lower techs at the bottom, better techs at the top) seems common place to us today, but to the best of my knowledge this was the first - Francis Tresham you are a genius (Sid Meier take note!).

The fact that there are no dice leaves simple, no nonsense combat, the random effect is introduced by calamities hidden in the trade cards. These range from nasty to empire crippling, but the game remains balanced.

The trade cards offer a fantastic opportunity for players to interact (and stitch each other up - some of the calamities are palmed off on others!)

There is excellent opportunity for pacts, and therefore treachery! And no-one ever gets too far ahead - if they do they simply get knobbled by the other players!

All in all this is a fantastic game of player interaction: pacts, war & duplicity. It is beautifully balanced and keeps players keen until the very end.

The below configuration (5 players) works quite well with just the standard board as well, if you use the Tom Lehmann house rule for Egypt and Babylon: the require only 5 tokens to build a city on a flood plain. This minor fix is terrific and seems to straighten out the balance with a minimum of fuss.
---
UPDATE: Recently tried a new tweak to the configuration: with 5 players, play the official "shorter" game variant, which goes to the last triangle on the AST and removes all the Mysticism cards. Also, remove 1 of each non-Civic Civilization card to put some pressure back on card purchases (so there are 3 of each instead of 4). This works really well and we played the whole game in 4.5 hours without feeling like we were missing anything, and the lack of Mysticism really turns the screws on the 3 colors and 7 cards barriers, which overall felt good. Best configuration of Civilization I've tried in the last few years of getting in 2-3 games a year.
---
Recent plays have kicked the rating for this one back up. This is a really cool game. Too interesting and subtle to be well-served by a brief comment here. Civilization is a great game because, like so many other great games, it manages to find a sweet spot, achieving considerable depth while playing cleanly and intuitively without a great deal of complexity, having nice historical flavor while maintaining integrity as a game, and requiring skill to play well and yet having enough randomness to be flavorful, fun, and allow nominally "less-skilled" players to be competitive.

My recommendation is to play this with 5 players. 7 players makes the game too long, I think, and some of the trading balances are out of whack. 6 is very good, but 5 makes the game short enough (5-6 hours) to be playable without extreme dislocation. Recently played a game with 4 players, and was pleased by how well that worked out as well, although we didn't save as much time as I had hoped (still ~5hr).

I've taken to removing one Civilization card from each pile with 4 or 5 players. I think that works well and puts some pressure back on the players to get the good cards before they're gone.

Ouch – this game is by far the hardest for me to rate of any game I’ve played… The reason is that the gameplay was very good, but on the other hand it’s not likely a game that I’m going to play again (at least not the full game)! The reason is that the game is simply way too long… We were 5 players (only 1 experienced players and 3 beginners), and we had to stop after 9 hours, even though we still were a few rounds from finishing the game… I still feel I can rate it as I played it for so many hours, and I feel I experienced what the game had to offer. I am sure that the game can be played a lot faster, but I cannot see it last for less than 7-8 hours unless you’re experienced, and that’s something I’m never going to be with this game!
So even though the game as such was quite enjoyable, and while I do understand why some people think it’s epic, it’s not a game I want to play a lot in the futures because of the extremely heavy time investment! You really have to set a whole day aside for this game… And that’s when I’m asking myself: is 8+ hours of Civilization really better than playing 4 games of Agricola or 3 games of Terra Mystica? No, it isn’t in my book, and I’m always going to compare games like that (what I am I able to play in the same time).

Regarding the actual gameplay, it was far more simple than I had feared (I hadn’t read the rules). It was actually quite easy to dive into and we didn’t have many questions. There was an ebb and flow feeling of your empire which worked well, but I don’t think that the progress of the game was that big, it’s really just more of the same in the last few rounds. You can be hit by disasters, and they can punch you hard in the stomach and face (and possible even your b*lls) at the same, but then you just have to regroup and rebuild and start over. But these disastrous catastrophes… They are what I hated the most about the game (except for the length). They hit randomly (unless you count the cards which is quite hard to do) and can be extremely crippling if you’re hit by the worst catastrophes. And you’re not only “just” targeted by this catastrophe, you’re also losing the normal trading card you would receive, so you’re actually hurt even more! Furthermore, from a non-game play perspective, it’s very hard to avoid seeing the red cards if you’re the one shuffling, so it gives a significant strategic advantage which is too bad (the person who shuffled the cards admitted this problem too).

As said, Civilization was more simple than I had thought, and it’s certainly one of the game’s strengths! It’s so lovely simplistic that you only have 1 military unit available, that he can move 1 region and kill 1 other unit (of course this is adjusted with modifications you get from technologies, but it’s still very simple). Speaking of technologies, the tech tree was pretty cool, but perhaps there were actually too few cards and a little less meat than what I would have preferred (regarding the number of technologies and the prerequisites and requirements for those etc.). But on the other hand it’s so streamlined that it’s easy to play and get a good overview as you don’t have to learn a ton of technologies. I liked that not every player is able to get every technology (which I understand is different in Adv. Civ. as all players have access to all of the techs, so I think I prefer regular Civilization).

Generally speaking, the races seemed balanced even though I think it’s a little weird that there is a difference of two AST requirements on some of the lowest civs compared to those in the top; the top-civs are having a much easier time getting two cities, getting 3 different colored cards etc. without having to “pass” for a turn. Furthermore, ties are broken from the top of the AST tree, so these civs have an advantage I think (though it obviously depends on the number of players and which races they choose). Yes, I know that those civilizations in the bottom of the AST get to buy technologies first, but I still think those in the top are slightly stronger. But of course, this is only based on a single play, so I might be way off here (I played Egypt myself and did pretty good). Regarding the picks of your civilizations, it is quite bad… You randomly get a turn order to pick your civ. We were 5, and the last one had the options of choosing Crete (as a new player = tough!) or Assyria which was boxed in by Asia and Babylon… I think this player was at a disadvantage before the game had even started!

The micromanagement of moving your pieces around in order to survice in the different areas is something I found interesting, and it was a pleasure when you were able to make a city in a size 1 dessert by spending 12 men!

A negative to the game was that the trading phase can really drag! We were only 5 players, and after the first couple of rounds we decided to set a time limit of 10 minutes. With so many rounds in the game, this adds up, but I cannot see how you would be able to make trades in just 5 minutes or so, especially as you cannot say which cards you want to trade, so you always need to calculate if there is a disaster among them. Another negative is the actual design of the game board; it’s extremely hard to see the different regions around Greece when there are many chits. I understand that it’s because of balancing issues, that there are so many areas there, but it’s extremely unmanageably and confusing... 

Bottom line:  is 9 hours of Civ more fun than 6 times 1.5 hours of other games? No, it isn’t, and that’s why I’m not going to play Civ a whole lot, though I would be willing to play it again with the alternative end-game conditions which shorten the game.

A milestone in gaming history though very long. War plays a very minor part as this is not about conquering large swathes of territory. The players are really battling the calamities rather than each other. Pleasing board artwork and the cover of the Avalon Hill 2nd edition by Rodger B. MacGowen is one of my favourite boardgame covers even if it's really a collage of three movie posters.

My copy is in pristine condition (no wear whatsoever) except for very minor marks at the lower edge on the front of the box.

Even though this is in a genre that I'm not terribly fond of (dudes on a map), I find the process of managing the expansion and rebuilding of my civilization to be a very satisfying experience, and the tech tree was of course a brilliant idea. I wonder if this game is maybe best with five. Any more seems to lead to players on the ends of the map spending eight plus hours in a game with barely any interaction between each other outside of the trading rounds. I have huge issues with the bash the leader aspect of the game as well as the fact that players can spend most of the game with no hope of winning if they miss an AST advance more than once. Every game ending with the player claiming to be in second place trying to assemble a kingmaking coalition of the willing (with a lot of prospective members who can't win) against the putative first place player is getting seriously old for me at this point. I would probably switch to only ever playing Advanced Civilization if I could get away with it with my annual Civilization-playing group.

I was stupid enough to sell this game in college to someone I didn't know. This is, perhaps, one of my all-time favorite games! I bought this game immediately after playing it when I was 16. Perhaps nostalgia fogs my memories. Either way, it is a game I regret no longer having in my meager collection - especially since I have found a group in my area who are willing to play! ARGH! >:( Damned shortsightedness on my part!! 

Very complex play, iirc. Definately NOT as simple as Catan. Avg playing time for my old group was around 10.5 hours.

(I've never played normal Civ, only the Advanced variant of the game. My take on the title in general is that with fast players it's an interesting game that has a better fundamental way of dealing with combat and forcing player interaction than most others in its genre. 

The limited advances in the original version of the game seem interesting in theory, but I've not heard positive things about them in practice, and I don't know anyone who prefers playing the original game so its doubtful that I'll ever get it onto the table.

In general, I think Through the Ages does this type of game better, but I don't mind playing it if the players are all relatively fast).

How can you go wrong with a game that a hundred other games aspire to be?  A game that defines an entire genre of games?  Yeah, it can be a little long and a little dry, but this is a straight up great game.  Made even better by the expansion if you can play with that.

Still one of the greatest games ever created...don't be a spoiled Eurogamer crybaby and mistake "long" for "pointless", "boring", or "inelegant"- here "long" means development, long-term planning, a stately and steady pace, and lots of room for creative play.  I'd rather play 1 game of Civilization over 12 games of most German titles.

The main problem in my opinion is the sheer length. Otherwise a great game. If somehow you could compress the length this could be a 8 or 9.

RATING: 7
You either love or hate Civilization. I enjoy it tremendously despite only playing it once or twice a year: it is a great way to spend the time with serious board game fanatics. All aspects of the evolution of a civilization—trade, expansion, conflict, progress and disaster—are blended in a way which remains attractive and unequalled despite the game's age. The downside: you need lots of players and [i]lots[/i] of time. And I've never grown accustomed to the idea of having pyramid cities in Illyria resulting from resolving the Civil War calamity. But that's probably me.

[b]Update[/b] After playing this game for about 10 times now, I've decided to I'm going to lower the rating somewhat. The game wears well with age, but I've begun to notice that careless trading can result in game-breaking imbalances. It is nearly impossible to keep up with what everyone is doing until you reach the civicard acquisition phase where more often than I would like I have seen people boasting a hand of cards which they would never have amassed if the others kept a bit of an ear out. In addition, the game really requires you to actively hit on others to keep them from growing too quickly; the AST won't do it in those circumstances. The game takes too long for the rather childish tit-for-tat disaster exchange which does nothing but hinder trade and makes everyone distrust each other. If you [i]don't[/i] hit on the others, someone will inevitably take the lead from which it is game-technically impossible to dislodge him, or rather, impossible without becoming [i]really[/i] nasty. I would be in favour of a variant which doles out all of the various disasters openly, and somewhat strengthens the role of conflict. However, the current limitations on civicards should be maintained as this makes you think about your long-term goals instead of just blindly buying what you need.

For a 1980's game, Civilization is still an impressive achievement. But it's not perfect for every group as it requires a strict mode of play (not to mention a lot of time) which does not appeal to everyone.

I bought this from Grant Hill's store Alternate Reality on Broadway Ave. in Saskatoon.  I worked with his wife Colleen at the time.  I have certainly got my money's worth out of this game!  It takes 10 hours to play the game to completion, and having played Civilization and Advanced Civilization to completion maybe 10 times over the years.  3 or 4 years ago I began making my own home-made copy of Civilization: The Expansion Project, which expands the game to 51 advances and up to 18 players.  I need to get back to that, preferably in time for my 50th birthday party in April 2015.
I always play Advanced Civilization now, never just Civilization.  A few years ago I estimated that this pair of games was worth about $700.

Comes close to "The Perfect Game" for me. In its way quite abstract (population, armies and influence are all represented by "tokens") the game is very balanced and the rules are easy to grasp. In the trading phase player interaction is intense and fun. It is very unlikely for a player to drop out of a game or to be defeated prematurely which ensures a good gaming experience for everyone at the table.

A definite milestone on the progress of game design.  The scope of the game does go a long way towards justifying the time required.

Overall the mechanics are quite fun and I can see why a "Civ-lite" game is the holy grail for many gamers.

An all-time favorite from the dark ages of gaming. Love the simplicity of teaching it: you really don't need to know much at the start, and you have only one piece, and the game gets a bit more involved each turn. You can explain the rules as you go. Also, the scale of it going from nothing to big civs...and the epicness of it. After ten hours it certainly feels like you have lived the scope of history!  Alas, impossible to get played as it should, with six plus players and all day. I prefer the basic game to advanced...I think the added stuff in advanced makes the game more complex while muddying up the simplicity of the concept.

Too much clunkiness for this to be enjoyable.  Lots of down-time, interminable trading sessions, high degree of high-impact randomness in the calamities, and an unintuitive population-tax trade-off.  Even when I do well in this game it's painful.

I used to play this back in high school and college quite a bit, and it was a fine game in its day. There were problems to be sure - a couple of early calamities could sometimes be impossible to recover from, but it was still fun.

Unfortunately, this game has aged badly. Incredibly long length of play combined with few real decision points are a serious drawback. Most of the actual playing time, and the vast majority of "strategy", is spent in trading and purchasing. On top of that, too many people fly into fits of anger when attacked, so a military strategy is mostly impossible in practice since they, and their friends, will no longer trade with you, ever.

At least the 11 card limit made purchasing decisions difficult. You really had to decide if that Mysticism was really worth it. In [i]Advanced Civilization[/i] they removed that restriction, and the game was reduced to a calamity management exercise.

Play [i]Through the Ages[/i] or [i]Antike[/i] instead.

Update: Had to drop this game from a 9 to an 7.  It has a big bash-the-leader problem towards the end.  I realize this is part of the game, but it has bothered me for a few games now...and my gaming tastes have changed such that this no longer appeals to me.  Still a fun game through 80%.   The correct end-game strategy (if I'd call it one) is to sandbag if you are winning.  Thereby providing you an argument that you are not a threat to win.  Unfortunately, this extends an already long game so that others can catch up.  Then try to slingshot for the win....maybe through horded trade cards.  But even this strategy will be blatantly obvious.  Maybe the best "strategy" is to just flub a few turns.  Therein lies the game's weakness.

Older comments:
What a game!  I really want to rate this game a 10, but there are a few elements that work against it.  The most obvious being that it is a 10-12 hour game, and it is possible that half the players will be out of contention with 3 or more hours still left to play.  The trade phase is a bit cumbersome to newbies.  Also, the calamities seem to bite those that are already behind.  Rating may go up with more plays against experienced players.  Take away these 3 negatives, and it is a 10.**Updated**, bumped rating up from 8 to 9...calamities hitting the weak seemed to have been a fluke and trade phase seems to work very well w/a different group

I've got this edition http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/158559, which indeed is by Welt der Spiele. I bought it when I was like twelve and my brother ten. We always felt it was a good game but it never quite showed. No wonder: we only played two player games and we were way too young. I will definately try to seriously play this some time but it is not easy too find the right people for it. I won't rate it on the experience I have.

A classic monster game of the 80's when weekend long games were the norm, and not the exception.

It has been a long time since I played this game (and then only a few times), so I actually have forgetton most of the rules, but it is one of those games that I would love to play on a weekend some day with the right group.

I think it is one of the greatest games, and I don't rate it higher just because I haven't played it in so long, and only have some memories to go with a few plays.  I want to try it again in a modern frame of mind before I rate it higher.

[b][FirstPlayOn9thMay2014][/b] Being an old game, the manual is a turn off for me. I read the rules rewrite available here on BGG and it was a breeze, surprisingly.

I love how simple the game was, and how easy everything is executed. Well except when you're hit by any calamities, especially the Civil War. I'm actually quite baffled at why we took 7 hours from start to finish, because most of the time, all players took actions simultaneously (whenever necessary to speed up the game). I remember reading somewhere that it's often good to put a time limit during trading (5 minutes) but I didn't remember if we ever exceeded that limit.

Anyway, I really enjoyed the game overall. How the calamities are exchanged between players didn't make sense to me but there should be a reason behind that mechanic for sure.

Played once 20 years ago. Remember being seriously unimpressed: repetitive, boring, too long (although at the time I could stay all night playing Diplomacy or wargames) and seriously unrealistic (tanks attacking legions?); the trading of commodities was just like "Go Fish"; now this was  a long time ago, I should probably give it another try; the required number of players and necessary time investment make it unlikely though

Has a cool trading system, area control and a passable civ/tech tree. The first 4 hours are great, and then the game continues its self by hitting the players rather randomly with game changing set backs. Many of the mechanics in the game seem to just extend the play time beyond what's fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Probably my favorite boardgame of all time.  The mechanics are largely deterministic, with only a little luck per the card draw.  But the calamity cards, and the way they could be foisted off on trading partners, is just so brilliant.  One of the few games that non-gamers, after I'd forced them to play initially, would return enthusiastically for more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.75
Civilization is one of my favorite games. It is another classic board game for me. Civilization is just a bit too long to play a complete game, (never saw the real ending), but I don't really mind too much compared to other long games. I wish I would play Civilization more often than I do now these days.

I wonder how Civilization is with the Western expansion and Advanced Civilization which I own, but I never played with. I would like to try Civilization with both expansions one day.

I need to play with the right people. Not everyone wants to sit at the same game for many hours at a time. Plus this game is better with 6-7 people. The whole map is used.

Might show only one game played, but played it more often before recording my games played on the BGG.

Can't wait to play Civilization again.

I do like the trading aspect of the game, but in the end, it feels too much like a race game and those don't score high with me. The interesting part in the game is supposed to be a balance between advancing, and getting the cards you want. Yet, this is not really an issue because you can't fall behind and win unless every single other player does so as well at some point in the game, which is near impossible. I'm still glad I played it at least once in my life though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
After many years of playing only Advanced Civ, I finally got a play in without the expansion.  It's largely the same game with or without, but there are a couple of differences that are significant.

I like the restrictions on Civ card purchasing, as it adds an extra level of tension to the game.  It's a pity that was dropped with Advanced Civ.  

However, Advanced Civ made a number of small adjustments to the trading that I think improved it quite a bit - in particular, the calamities are now much better integrated.  In regular Civ the calamities seem like a big hairy deal, and it is often easy to tell who has them; in Advanced Civ they seem more like an unavoidable (though manageable) cost of trading, and I like that better.  

All in all, I have to give the nod to Advanced Civ, but in the end Civ is a fantastic game with or without the expansion.

A rich and challenging game encompassing the entire spectrum of civilisation building from exploration to expansion to development. The game has very good pacing: although it has a long playing time, you don't feel it all. But the main problem is finding the playing time in the first place. UPDATE: I'm going to retract my earlier statement about long playing time. It really only applies if you play with 6-7. Otherwise, it's quite manageable.

RATING: 6
[1 play] Totally worth the experience to play this classic epic game.  It seemed pretty harsh on the weaker factions, because they kept getting hit with disasters.  People say that passing the secret disasters is supposed to be a way to rein in the leaders, but if your civilization is weak, you're not drawing high enough cards to get the secret disasters.  You're just getting hit over and over with the low-level disasters, which can be pretty disastrous.  
The other thing that really struck me here was the importance of trading.  The pricing structure is such that there's really no hope of being able to get any decent advances unless you can do some really successful trades.  I did not prosper at this.  
But all in all, it was fun, and getting beat up by the experienced players is certainly what I expect in playing something like this for the first time. I'd play again, but preferably with a commitment from everyone to actually finish the game.  I know it makes real-world logistical sense to set a time cutoff for long games, but I hate playing for 10 hours and then not seeing it through to the finish.

I really liked this, but I was in the minority.  Of the other three players, one player hated it due to repeated calamities, another never really got anywhere, and the third felt that the game was just too long and 'fiddly' to play again.

So many great memories of late, late nights playing this game.  It was really a pioneering game that left behind the extraordinary intricacies of AH wargames for an exquisite simplicity that simulated the ancient world while challenging the players.  This game could well have been the inspiration for the new generation of euros.  Now that I'm older I expect never to have the time to play it again.  But I keep my copy handy, though.  Just in case.

RATING: 6
Back in the day, this was my all-time favorite game; now, my tastes have substantially changed. I was doing well for most of the game but got hit with 5 calamities in three turns plus had to deal with the side effect of another player's calamity. I was unable to rebuild before getting hit again, and as a result I was out of the game for the last 2 hours. I can't play competitively then simply turn that off when events beyond my control remove me from the game and render my decisions uninteresting. 

A lot of excellent ideas, but I would prefer some type of calamity mitigation (get an immunity chit for every 2 that hit you?). Seems like if you can have some clear turns in between your calamities, you're OK, otherwise you're cooked. Taking 9-12 hours to find out is simply too much. Sometimes there's no going back.

This is my favorite game of all time.  When I was getting married I chose to play this for my bachelor party instead of getting laid by a stripper.  And it was worth it!

I think that it's a little bit broken because I cannot be beaten if I play Egypt.  That's not a brag.  I don't think anyone who understands the basics of the game can lose with Egypt.

So I try to get people to play this with me and succeed at least once a year.  It's always fun for me and too long for everyone else.

When I was invited to play this 10 hour game I said yes because it is a classic I had never played.  I didn't think I would like it.  But wow, what a game.  

Everyone gets smashed over and over. If someone is a whiner, don't play with them--it will be 10 hours of whining.  Because everyone gets devastated numerous times, leaders can change often.  Very interactive. 

A slow start doesn't mean you will lose.  In fact keeping the fewest farmers on the board to go last is advantageous.  

Length of time is the only drawback, but my friend has an amazing recessed game table that can be covered--so easily broken into two session--much better with adults with families and jobs.

Wish this game were affordable, I would buy it.

This game is kind of hard to rate. I played this a lot when I was younger (and could play all night). The design is actually very good, especially the balancing between stock and treasure and the trading rules in the advanced game. I also like the epic feeling of building your own empire and managing it through thousands of years.
However, it takes a lot of optimizing and number-crunching to play this game well. I also dislike the diplomacy elements in the game. And last but not least this game is far too long for what it is. It could be bearable if it lasted for five hours, but twelve hours is simply too much. I wouldn't play this game without a timer in the trading phase. All things said, I still have very fond memories of playing this game for days and nights when I was younger.

Civilization is best played as a role-playing game in my opinion. However, the game and its descendants are epic affairs regardless of your role-playing proclivities. For the purpose of this entry I'm including all of Civ, Advanced Civilization, and Mega Civilization, though I've only played the original.

[2015.07.20]
I have fond memories of this game occupying a whole summer before my friends and I discovered girls and computers and RPGs.  I would have to guess that we played it at least a dozen times that summer, give or take a few.  Why not?!  We had all day.

This has to be one of the all-time classics. It would be a 10 except for the length of the game. That's the only downside. Advanced Civ has helped a bit, but still runs a good 6 hours.

One word review - WOW.

Simple mechanics and a nice trading system combine for an excellent game. But it takes TOO DAMN LONG. The games I have played have all extended more than 5 hours and many were never completed. Also works best with a full roster of players and getting 8 people to commit that long is very difficult to achieve. I would rate this a 10 but the game length has means that I have not played since 1995 although not for lack of desire.

Possibly the best game ever - a true classic. The only problems are the length and the need for a large group of players to get the most out of it.
Also, it can be affected by some players falling effectively out of the running if they fail to progress on the AST (though they can continue to play a full role in the game), which is cured to some extent by Advanced Civ.

I bought this Avalon Hill game in this 1980s. It takes 7 players to play it to its full potential. I could never get 7 players. It takes a long time to play. But the ONE time I played it, I LOVED it. I would LOVE to play it again with 6 other players. Simple in concept. Build, Expand, Resource cards, Technology tracks. Not really a war game. More like Diplomacy style movement and battle results, but with so much more. I can see why it was a convention favorite for many years.

[b]Civilization + Advanced Civilization[/b] [i]Francis Tresham 1981/1993[/i] 
Advanced Civilization is just the best boardgame I had ever played. Since it is very difficult and expensive to get, you can try its computer version which is available for free download (abandonware) although is not exactly the same thrilling thing than playing around the table with other seven or so human players. Despite this many nice options its rules are quite easy to grasp. Trade system is a blast, outstanding for its time and still fresh as the first day. With advanced rules the game experience is just the best I ever had with a boardgame. Absolutely brilliant but... really long and hard to get so many people with that much spare time.

An extremely long game, and certainly complex, but not insanely heavy like you might expect such a long game to be.  The rules are straightforward and easy to remember if you've got a turn order reference in front of you.

Not really sure what to think about this game after only one play.  The tactical decisions on the board don't seem to make much of a difference.

Dont see how is could possibly be worth the time to play again.

RATING: 7
I really feel the similarity to Revolution by Tresham, which I suppose for most people would run the other way around--but I played Revolution first. I feel the score could go up substantially if only there were a good player aid summarizing the calamities and the techs. 
I was shocked at how balanced the calamities felt--you could get hit rather hard and not be out of the running. Navigating your population limits is rather tiresome, though, and it feels like you're doing that most of the time. That said, there's a great sense of development going on here, and the trading does link everything together rather nicely. 
I am somewhat conflicted on whether or not the game warrants the length. I am interested in giving it another go.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
Last play was 15+ years ago, so what do I think today? First off, it takes waaaaaaaaaay too long and that's because of a few things that don't help the game much.

The game is already slow and then you have all those disasters that can destroy up to atleast half of your board. These cards add luck, much playtime as you have to start over again and are far from being balanced.

The game may have been good ages ago, but I would avoid it nowadays for sure.

09/11/08 Reduced rating from 6 to 4, which more acurately represents how I feel about this game.  Through the ages is a much better civilization building game.

I love this classic cultural expansion game.  Luck plays a role with the trade cards and calamities, but conflict is resolved by simple attrition.  There is little chance of player elimination, but it is possible to be 'marginalized' by stronger neighbors (as in real history, that this game attempts to simulate).  The game play in my opinion is closer to modern 'euro-games' than old school 4x boardgames.  Nothing like the new Sid Meier's Civ, worth playing if you know anyone who owns a copy.

I loved this game before I found BoardGameGeek. Now I see its blemishes -- long playing time, long downtime between turns, players can be knocked out of the running in the first few turns (especially true with Crete), needs at least five players to fly, ad nauseum.

And on the seventh day God said 'let there be Civilization' and the Euro-game was created. Lo, it was fair to look upon and seductive but God saw that it was bad because it took an eternity to play and victory was so scripted that it was devoid of skill and substance. Weary, He rested for the remainder of the seventh day, intending to return it to the void on the morrow. But verily the Beast escaped and spread its seed across the land and slew The Avalon Hill Game Company. And the world was cursed with Euro-games thereafter.

I'd love to try this but seriously, 6 hours?

I could never buy that, does Antike not offer a very similar game but easier and shorter?

Edit - played it now and my god did I love it!!!

The movement, population increases, taxation and other points are all fairly simplistic (and not the kind of dynamic that I normally like) but I think the way that population and money come from the same stock of tokens and that you have no choice but to collect taxation, but you MUST have enough tokens on the board to support your city - well frankly I think that's a stroke of brilliance which forces such tough planning decisions.

It's also really interesting in the sense that you don't want cities on your borders. In Antike/other games you don't want cities/temples on your boarders because they're vulnerable, but here you don't want them on your boarders because they become obstacles for your troops. (which is an odd concept).

The trading is frankly a masterstroke. The way in which you draw cards is clever and then the way in which you trade them is equally so. Swapping 2 cards which are known and 1 which is not is really clever. Some people will not want to trade out of fear of getting a flood/disease but the idea of shutting up shop and not trading at all is even more dangerous still - you NEED to trade in order to get sets. You just need to hope that you can continue trading to get rid of the disasters you've been handed. I would suggest never doing more than 1 trade per round, the 2nd or third is guaranteed to contain a disaster because at that point in the trading round the only players looking to trade are the ones that have them.

I think this game has some excellent mechanics but needs to be republished with some better end game conditions and some sort of trading limit (to add structure and stop the round going on indefinitely).

I think with reasonable improvements you could bring it back down to 4 hours and that would make it doable. As it is we played 6 player for 8 hours and didn't quite finish it. Enjoyable though!

I haven't played this in a long time (five or six times in the 80s)- my rating might go up again if I played this again. It is rather learnable, yet very complex and fulfilling. I am scheduling the next session for about 2021, when the kids are old enough to play this.

I played a handful of games back in my high school days. We never finished a game, because curfew always got in the way. It was innovative for its time. I bought a copy on eBay for nostalgia, and I'm still trying to find 12 hours to play it, let alone find six other players to teach it to. Like some of the games I've commented on, this is a significant and historically important gaming design. However, due to its extremely long playing time, this will almost never see the table today, especially when there are so many other titles to choose from. Well, someday, maybe I'll be able to revisit fond memories of this game.

Update (02/10/13): After playing a complete game of Advanced Civilization, the base game will never be played again. Still, it's a solid '7'.

Uncompromisingly long, unless you compromise on the length.

RATING: 7
This is a great game.  It is involving and has trading, diplomacy, random chance...lots of good things.  The huge issue with it is the extremely long play time (6+ hours at least, maybe 10+).  Maybe some people can play this on a regular basis but I'm lucky if I can organise enough people with enough time available once every couple of years.

I played (and still didn't finish) this game with six people recently, for the first time in the best part of 20 years, and it was still excellent.  I had forgotten how excellent the trading mechanic is.  I will need to search for a shorter game which has a similar trading mechanic!

As far as day-long games go, this goes hand in hand with Diplomacy for excellence, but it has very different mechanics and appeals to people who hate Diplomacy.  Personally, however, Diplomacy's ingenious combination of deterministic simultaneous action resolution with non-binding negotiation is the reason for the slight difference in score.

For me Avalon Hill Civilization was all the time the "Queen of Boardgames" (then I read on the geek that it is the grand-daddy of boardgames - do boardgames have a gender?). You can tell that its birth-year is 1980, so maybe today it is the "Queen-Mother of Boardgames". It scales well up to 7 players and has very elegant mechanics. It infected me with the Civ-game bug.

A seminal design for its day: acquire resources, trade, build. It's possible to see the origins of Catan right here. But, oh boy, what an immense disappointment playing this was. What starts as a no-luck, empire building and card collection game soon turns into a sprawling, chaotic and frankly rather boring mess as the calamities kick in. The chaos factor is simply huge. The effect of the Calamity Cards is just too severe (especially for Civil War) and too arbitrary as the recipient can pick others to suffer with them. The game also takes an insane amount of time to play (8 hours with 6 players for an intensely procedural game). Two-thirds of the way through, I was losing the will to live. 
The system adapts easily to house rules, however and the number of calamities can be tuned to taste. If you intend to play with more than 4, I suggest either removing some Calamity Cards or increasing the number of Trade Cards. There's a now hard to get official expansion that allows you to do this, or you can print your own cards from a file under the Advanced Civilization entry.

I played this a few times in my younger days (ie, some time in the 1980s).  It was kind of fun, but not fun enough to warrant the time investment.  Also, I didn't really like the Pit-like trading round.  If I'm in the mood for a large scale world development game, I'd rather do History of the World or Age of Renaissance.

Non-historical multi-player game set in the ancient Mediterranean.  There's lots of interesting stuff going on in this game, including expansion, resource trading, disasters, and a tech tree.  But the entire thing is deterministic; even the disaster cards are pre-assigned locations in the trade decks for some reason.  The end result is essentially an overlong, multi-player chess game; not for me.

Played many times and have never won. Never finished a game in under 1.5hrs per player either! There are two negatives to this wonderful game besides the length though.

RATING: 9.5
After playing online and via computer--truly an elegant, fantastic game. 

So many simple mechanics that end up being thematic somehow: the population doubling having an explosive condition and limiting condition; the management of population versus board resources via region numbers; the proportionality of your tokens representing both people and currency; cities simultaneous being bastions of defense but also being a resource sink; trading in the market and the handling of catastrophes (which at first seems unrandom, being played on you by other players, but in practice feels just like an unexpected natural disaster would); how different civs can coexist on the same space, but then conflict once population outpaces resources--all with a simple system of chits and numbered board spaces. As a work of game design, brilliant!

It's a wargame, but not. It's a resource management and optimiation game, but it's not. It's a thematic simulation, but it's not. There's area control, set collection, auctions, faction asynchrony (in start position and AST), catch-up mechanisms, VP gathering (well, that's mostly AH, but still)--in truth, this is the uber game.

And that's the one problem--it plays like an uber game. It's very long, and hard to get to the table. It'll take a few plays to really appreciate how to play. You can come back from mistakes, but one too many and you'll be out of the race.

Nonetheless, it's no surprise that, even with so many imitators and innovators, it's still a grail game in its own right after 30 some years. Truly a banquet feast for boardgamers with the appetite.

I only played through a complete game once.  It took 12 hours and was an all-nighter but somebody finally made it through the Archaeological Succession Table to become thoroughly civilized past the Iron Age.  The game is a lot of fun but it's an endurance grind.  I think if we tried it again, it might move a bit faster.

Oh boy..  It's difficult to judge this..

I really like many mechanisms (some of them still fresh up until now and begging to be used).  On the other hand there are typical 80s games flaws: king making and wealthy dose of randomness (->disasters).
On the whole the design is great despite its flaws, but it's safer to assume that's not a competitive game, but rather a kind of quasi-historical experience.
  Warning - some might not like the fact that this 'experience' takes so long (>6-7 hours) and would rather play something really competitive instead.  Personally, sometimes I'm in a mood to experience such an experience :-)  But still I'm not convinced to buy this one.  This might change or not.

This is really a review of Advanced Civ since BGG is not ranking Advanced Civ separately.
In my opinion, the best boardgame ever made.  Still nothing like it today (very weird actually - normally game designers feel free to borrow from previous games, and there's no one to actually legally defend this particular one).  It's a crime that it's out of print.  It has several unique and endlessly challenging and absorbing aspects:

1) The trading game is immense fun, trying to corner the market on one of the goods.  Everyone yelling out trades, desperately trying to get them done before the timer goes off.  Catan is a pale imitation.

2) The constant struggle to survive the continuous epic natural disasters flooding the land while trying to upgrade tech to fend them off, to avoid being beaten back into the stone age!  This game is as much about beating the board as it is beating your competitors.  Antiquity has some of this too, as I understand it, but no other game is quite like it.

3) The deceptively simple tactical game of moving your continually replicating but also dying pieces around, trying to keep any of them from starving, grabbing any land that frees up, getting your cities built while keeping enough farmland to feed them.  Oh yeah, and the occasional border raid or even limited war on your neighbor.  There is an entire game in just moving the pieces around.  In some respects, it reminds me of Small World in the sense of the claustrophobic impulse to carve out your space and defend it in a land that is too small for everyone.

It's only real limitation is that it's not a short game (ten hours or more).  It's not a war game either.  Really just a shoving match at most.  No one has enough pieces to grab more than a piece of the board.  The main thing is building up your population, building cities, getting goods from each one to trade, then turning them in to survive the next round of disasters.  And woe betide the next victim of civil war!  The only random factors are the trading cards and the disasters.  Boardgame movement and fighting is entirely diceless.  The player that handles these challenges most efficiently and who manages to grab more than his fair share of the board wins!

I love the depth and theme of this game. It feels like the origins of Mediterranean civilisation are lovingly engineered in, and there's lessons in historical simulation lurking in repeated play.

Classic game about emerging civilizations around the Mediterranean. It has an unhealthy long playing time which makes it a rare experience to actually get the chance play a game, but on the other hand the long playing time is necessary to allow players to get "into" the game, as it were (and the main reason why a "short civ" is probably impossible to create).

Compared with Advanced Civilization, Civilization is a lot more streamlined and overall feels more "German".

Civilization is a classic empire building game. The simple, airtight design provides accessibility for even the casual gamer. The game presents players with an array of decisions at every turn: where to settle your tribe, which advances to acquire (and in which order), when to battle a neighbor, how far to extend your empire, how to prepare for calamities, whether to trade, and when to bluff. Yes, it is quite long, but the pace is one of constant engagement. If you feel bored, then you are likely missing something happening around you (likey to your detriment!). My only minor quibble is that the absence of randomness can lead to occasional dry moments of predictability. Even with that, this is a vintage title that is standing the test of time admirably.

Solid game when it first came out, but the long playing time is a real negative factor.  The calamities, some of them, really seem to slow things down, as does the trading phase if you play without a timing device.  Advanced Civilization, rating would be the same.  Through the Ages is probably a more streamlined version, if you like this type of civ-building game.  Also, Parthenon (despite the naysayers here on BGG) is quite good.

I love this game and I have had it for nearly 30 years. But I've only played it three times. To do it justice you need at least 5 people and pretty much a whole day.

I kind of kick myself for not getting Advanced Civilization, but given how often I played the base game it really did not seem worth it.

Unforgiving? Hard to get back into play? I often get out in front by leagues in this game only to have all the other envious civilizations knock me back to the stoneage by ganging up on me. (So, "sprinting for the finish" is not often the best strategy.) To me, this is much more of a "Revenge of the Proletariat" game than a "Rich Get Richer" game. Just don't often have the days I can set aside to play this game.

OK, WOW, what a ride! Thresham is such a genius.

By today standards it's not the best game all around, but it's a classic for sure.
Like other AH tittles it's more an experience than a game.
Less cut-throat than RoR or Diplomacy, it can be a pretty satisfactory experience with a bunch of buddies and a lot of time. Until this situation arises, it's in my shelf for nostalgic reasons.

While I don't entirely remember the rules to AdCiv all that well, there are some definite flaws to this one: not enough trade cards, the AST doesn't change depending on what countries are playing (and it should), and most of all, while I like it a lot, it's too cumbersome to reward the time investment it would take to get good. 

It's frustrating that you can get toward the midpoint of a 14 hour game only to discover that there is absolutely no way you can win.

Don't get me wrong, I don't mind losing. I do it a lot, and happily - I am perfectly satisfied to be cannonfodder for Dan Raspler and whomever else. The cards aren't variable enough, though, so that the game (especially when there are fewer players) doesn't really abet open, improvisational play the way I just feel a good civ game should. Civilization is a masterpiece that would've been better with a few more routes to victory.

Mine is the AH first edition. Bought from a U.S. online retailer at a very reasonable price in 2002, I think. 

Unpunched until the next year, when it was sacrificed to be played by me and a childhood friend who had come to Uppsala for a weekend of playing games. We managed a five-player game in about 10 hours. 

I'm glad I realise games are meant to be played, not just collected (sometimes I start to worry for myself...)

Brilliant game by Francis Tresham with a lot of player interaction, simple rules and no dice! The sentence "This game does not use dice." in the inventory of the rulebook always makes me smile. This must have been rather exceptional back in the eighties. ***** The object of the game is to gain a level of overall advancement and as such, it is NOT a game that will be won by endless battles. ***** The game system is very well balanced, involving game play on the board (mainly building and supporting cities), trading cards with other players and buying a nice set of civilization cards. The main balancing element comes from a tactical use of the calamity cards (like flood, famine, civil war, ...). It is also important to divide your tokens carefully between your stock, treasury and territory to avoid unpleasant events. ***** Needless to say, but this is a game I like! The only minor point is the long duration (our first game lasted almost 17 hours! - 5 newbies - and we only started at two in the afternoon ... we did pause for a light meal).

Compared to Advanced Civilization, which I got to try first: The need to plan for future buys more carefully, next to no luck in card draws, and the superior trading system (allowing you to target someone exactly with a calamity instead of just hoping it doesn't come back to you before trading ends) appeal to me more than ACiv's extended tech and variation. Yes, ACiv is the more "thematic" game (though one can argue that in base Civ the way every nation can't get every card brings forth their differences in a more realistic way), but I like the "gamey" nature of Civ more at least at the moment, and to be honest, ACiv ain't exactly a simulation either. Here the different aspects are balanced better, the emphasis is less on just getting the best deals and turning in full trade sets. The original also plays a couple hours less which is a major pro. However, to avoid runaway loser -situations and to keep a lengthy game interesting for everyone until the end, for 6 players or more ACiv is the way to go.

Both ways of playing Civ are just sublime and captivating games with a relatively simple ruleset. You need to have a whole day for the full game, but it's worth it.

A fun but very long game about development, commerce, and war among early peoples of the Mediterranean (and thereabout).  The stock/treasury/board tradeoffs make for a very interesting economy, and the trading rounds are fun.  But — The game is not kind to new players, who need to know what the 11 civ card limit means before they’re burned by it toward the end of the game.  And the trade round requires some fast mental math, so you can successfully fake people into taking calamities.  And did I mention that it’s a very long game?

Long game.  Long enough where there are times it drags.  My group allowed trading to go on indefinatly originally and this is certainly a mistake, trading should be done by the rules.  Disasters can be quite ruthless and depending on your views and your group it could get you quite upset to have disasters dumped on you.  A fun game to sit around and be social with though and I would probably play again in the future if I still knew the individual that owns it.  Probably best with as near a full compliment of players as you can muster.  Good enough where I am considering picking up Through the Ages because of it.

One of the great, long-lasting games of our century ;), Civilisation went on to be copied by Sid and turned into a vastly successful computer game.  I only played the game once or twice, back in college when I could get enough people together, and it was a hootenanny good time.  Combat is present in the game, but it is only a tool which is often times less effective than other tools at winning the game.

A very solid game where you start with a single chip and build up your civilization to add cities.  As you add cities you get cards to make sets that you can turn in for money to get technologies.  The technologies give you discounts and abilities in the same.  It is fun; however, it is too long.  The game ought to be played with a timer during trading and during turns.  Everyone should complete his or her turn in less than 2 minutes.  I find it painful when it goes for more than 10 hours.  And often it does.

An ageless classic. Excellent design, featuring a clever management system which forces players to juggle resources between population, cities and treasure. Good trading mechanics, too, albeit a bit convoluted. Tactical and strategic choices abound. The game really gives an epic feel as you watch your civilization develop and (hopefully) prosper. The only serious problem of this game is the horrendously long playing time. You need to plan ahead to be able to play this one.

Played this once in my early twenties with 7 or 8 of us. Felt like I'd turned thirty during the game, and gave up after *12 hours*. There are games out there I could happily play for 12 hours straight, but this one did not keep me gripped for anything like that length of time... far far far too long.

Played once but I loved every time of it, ten+ years ago. 
Long, it's true: but who cares when you enjoy yourself? I got a French edition, first to save the collector's fee on AH copies, second because french text is very similar italian, and easier to play (since this is the game I'll use to introduce my players to monster games). Components are better than the old AH version (counters and cards laminated).

This game is really good, but it is extremely long.  At one point I was going to try to try to organize a special event with my game group to get it on the table, but I couldn't figure out how a full game could last less than 12 hours.  Ultimately I would rather play several different games over an afternoon than this one.  I ended up selling my copy on ebay and I doubt I'll regret it.

Rating applies to Advance Civ - I believe I've only played the original base game once, ever).

Recent plays of this game on line have led to my re-rating of the game. It really was a design that was way ahead of it's time. I still think it's a bit calamity heavy and doesn't discourage conflict enough to keep someone from *really* thinking through being an aggressor (or easing the burden on someone simply trying to protect themselves from an aggressor).

Session report:28/09/08

Well, here it was. Ranked 66 on the Geek, a classic, scheduled to possibly last all day. This game was actually one of the driving forces behind setting up the meet in the first place. There were six of us keen to try it, three newbies of myself, Ian (iansc) and Dave, (BrightonFoxDave) and three "non-newbies" in Martin (martind), Ron and Howard. (What IS a one word term for someone who's not a newbie?)

Now, seeing as the game took up 8 hours of my life, I'm not going write a report that'll take a similar length of time to digest.

However.

Looking up comments about it, I see it's received numerous 10 ratings! Comments such as "One of the best games ever", "A masterpiece of strategy; flawless", "The all-time classic no-luck, empire building, trading, civilization game"...wow, I thought, I hope my very limited experience with Civ action won't put me at too huge a disadvantage. Ron seems to be the expert at these kind of things, with subtle advice, useful snippets of historical accuracies and inaccuracies, and it's amazing how much of his advice helps shift the game in his direction...funny that, eh?

Anyhow. Hmm. Flawless? No-luck? Eh? What? Come again? One more time? Sorry, didn't quite catch that? Are these people INSANE?! Calamities? CALAMITIES?? CHUFFING CALAMITIES!!!??? A couple of things. Civil War. Fancy losing half your empire for pretty much no reason whatsoever? Sure, why not! And, no, the whole "you need to plan for it" is utter balls when you need philosophy or democracy which are two of the most expensive civilization cards there are. How pray do you afford these in turn 5 or 6? Sigh. As the more perceptive might realise, this happened to me. But I wasn't alone in the misery. Ian had 7 cities one turn. The next? None! Huzzah! Get a round in! :laugh: Howard was unlucky enough to be hit by THREE calamities in a turn. (One primary and two by other folks who were intent on sharing the pain). Fantastic! This game is a flawless classic gem of a peach of a diamond!

By hour six, we were flagging, the constant ebb and flow of territories just seemed mostly pointless. There was little conflict, any that there was was a result of expanded population and a desire to at least put them to some use even if that meant sacrificing them for no gain. We all just wanted to get along. The game as a whole just felt too haphazard. Got a nice little not-too-big not-too-small empire going that's gathering you trade cards? Not for long, bucko, not when a famine, a flood, an epidemic, and oh look, another b*st*rd civil war comes along. In one turn. :cry:

It definitely got to the point where several of us were just determined to get to the end, like a knackered marathon runner, stumbling along, knowing the end is coming but also knowing you're only HALFWAY through.

Speaking of which, in the time it took us to play, a Kenyan could have run three and three-quarter marathons.

As we drew to a close, there was slightly hysterical laughter and good natured ribbing going on. (Mostly from Dave who's from the North which explains quite a bit)

Ron won.

The turn track has that EXTRA space tucked away at the end that makes it look like you've finished, but oh no, to win, you've got to escape the turn track completely! There's STILL one more turn to play! HA! HA! HA! HA!

We didn't bother playing the last turn.

And, as we packed up our partially completed game (!), we realised we'd all played with one too few tokens the entire game, technically making the day null and void. Rematch anyone? Hello? Hello...where'd you go?

This is a great game ... best with 5 or 6 players and a whole day and at least two bottles of shiraz ... It's an excellent game to teach people because it starts off so slowly - not too much to absorb all at once.  It builds up at a good pace so people can get the mechanics ... unfortunately the decisions you make in the first hour (particularly for novices) will come back and haunt you at the end of the game!   A real classic with all the right ingredients - conflict, resource management, difficult decisions, balance, player interaction and fun.  Only real problem is finding 4-6 people who can play a game for 4 to 6 hours!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Elegant design with some simple but effective rules for building up civilizations and fighting other civs.  Way ahead of it's time... many of the mechanics can be seen in new games even now.  The heart of the game is trading goods and dealing with calamities.  The calamities give the game life and strife while trading is the key to winning.  

Games will take a full day and it's mostly worth it.  My biggest beef is that it can get really gamey at times.  For example, one may be thankful to receive a calamity in order to kill off people so that they have a larger supply to pay off taxes and circumvent a revolt.  One may want to shrink the number of cities built so that they are more likely to get cards before the stacks empty out.

Is it fair to say that it simply feels correct? The simple movement of armies and founding of cities as just the right feeling of what a civilization should be. The trading is gamey, but it seems to work well.

Better than Advanced Civ, and shorter too (which counts for quite a bit).  

Removing the constraint of limited no. of civ cards really altered the game in Adv Civ, and overall, for the worse I think.  The original game consequently has better pacing than Adv Civ and with greater differentiation between civs.

Plays quickly with experienced players (4 to 6 hours max) if you keep the amount of bargaining during trading reasonable.

I could rate this a 3 because I "Likely won't play this again although could be convinced"...but I wouldn't call it a bad game.  The only problem is that it's way too long.  After talking about how we had never before actually finished a game of Civilization, I dusted this off with a friend after about a decade...it took us 14 hours to finish a 2 player game.  Fourteen hours.  Just 2 players.  Can you imagine how many weeks it would have taken with 6 or 7 players???  And it doesn't really do anything that Settlers of Catan doesn't accomplish in an hour.  Think about it...in both of them you build cities which give you resource cards which you trade in for development cards which give you victory points.  I'd rather pull out Catan 12 times than have to pull an all-nighter on Civilization (which would no doubt be abandoned after hours and hours as every game of Civilization is)

This is one of those games you initially love, but then gradually finds flaws in.
Civilization has lots of strategies to prevent a player from winning, but very few to actually win. You just end up giving the victory to someone else.
... which means the best strategy is often not to lead, but do look like you'll come in second.
Fortunately, with Civ. there's Advanced Civ to replace it.

RATING: 10
Brilliant game.  I should mention that I thoroughly enjoy long, slower paced games.  I understand that it's not to everyone's taste but I find the argument that it 'hasn't aged well' to be total rubbish. I think I will always want to play this at least once a year.  I think it scales quite well from 4-7, heck I've even played it 2 player. I do sometimes play with the trade cards and the WXM.   Also, I play it without any unofficial variants or other nonsense, by the book (though rarely to the end of the AST). Except there are some good two player variants to try out.

I think I've settled in on liking this best with 6 players:
Easier to fit 6 around the table.
Definitely faster playing than 7 players.
Still use the full 4 panel map.
Games take about 6 hours if playing a couple triangles back on the AST.

Of course, in a perfect world, I'd always have time for a full game.

This is a genuine classic which spawned many other ganmes of the type. Yes it is long, but not as long as some people make out. Yes, one person can forge ahead, but the tall poppy syndrome is still valid. The rules are simple, the components (HT version)excellent and the amount of game play is outstanding. I have been playing this for almost 20 years, I own the Sid Meier PC versions and love them too but they are not the same game. No other game, IMO, has the depth and breadth of gameplay that this one has.

I prefer Advanced Civ to regular Civ because of the intangibles, really; regular Civ doesn't flow as well as Advanced Civ.  If you're the civilization that's locked out when an advance is completely bought up, then that's tough for you.  If you're the person who got stuck with the tradeable calamity, you can't trade it to someone else which limits trading.

This is a work of art. It is incredible how we get immersed in the theme - the movement, population growth and conflicts are genial. The trade phase is a bit gamey, though, and the resolution of the catastrophes take too long. Otherwise, a Civ game is always an epic experience.

My rating on this keeps jumping up and down as I'm torn between my memories of playing it in the past and my desire to play it in the future. I've rated it as high as a 10 and as low as a six.  I'm now wanting to play "epic" games a bit more than I did during my first year of playing euros, so I've bumped it back up.  Hopefully I'll get to play it again fairly soon; that experience will probably help me fix a personal rating on it.

If you like long, epic games this is one of the best.

This game showed me that there is a world of "serious" boardgaming beyond Monopoly and wargaming (P.S. I have much more respect for wargaming than I do for monopoly!). I'd give this game a 10 out of respect for its design, scope and its role in developing my gaming addiction. My only quibble with the game is that in a game of 7 players 1 or 2 of them just get unlucky early in the game and are then stuck with grinding it out for the next 4 hours with no prospect of winning. To be true to the BGG ranking definitions, I must give this a 7 because I just don't have the time to play this any more, or find others who want to play it, and there are so many other good games out there today that are much shorter and almost as satisfying.

RATING: 9
This game lets you experience the rise (and potentially fall) of a civilization. Attributes such as calamities affectig several players and trade revenue growing exponentially bring sudden changes to the board and a game is often open until the very last round. If I have the time, this is my first choice for a game night. 

Civilization takes less time than the advanced version but given the time, I always prefer the latter.

Pros: Feeling of building a legacy, high level of player interaction, all players participate to the end, balancing elements keeps the game open, variations throughout the game as calamities and trade deals change the balance.
Cons: Long game sessions.

Populate your region in ancient Egypt, build cities, earn cards, trade cards to earn advancements and progress your civilization. Played this game 4 or 5 times in my lifetime. I'm not sure how much patience I have to play this game these days since games last at least 5 hrs. Some neat concepts here. The disasters seemed quite random and getting into an early fight with your neighbor can be detrimental. If you don't mind the length of the game, can be very engaging for that duration.

- Play time 5 hours too long
- Suffers from analysis paralysis adding up your cards and deciding which to discard. 
- Rules are dated and too ambiguous.

I like the idea of civilization games but this is just like hard work.  Old 1980 Gibson Games version took 2 hours to initially set up and learn.  Played the 2-player variant. Each turn needed looking at the rules to play - not my idea of fun.  7 hours to play 225 moves (15 rounds of 15 actions), I'm losing the will to live.  I'd got it after 9 rounds of 15 actions which is the quickest game exit option in the rules.  Surely there is a quicker Civ game out there that is over in less than 100 moves or within 90 minutes.........7 Wonders, Roll Through the Ages?

I am starting to feel that I will never buy an older trailblazing game again - like Civilization, Cosmic Encounter and Railway Rivals.  They are just too dated and time consuming and have much cleaner modern versions with better explained rules.

Grandfathered in as one of those games that was critical to my evolution as a board-gamer, but I won't play these days due to the time commitment and the existence of better games.

RATING: 6
First impression: I was afraid rules would be more complicated and with more exception etc. but they were pretty straightforward and lots of different mechanics worked very well together. Hard to rate after the first game but since playing took some 10  hours and it didn't feel too long at all and I was playing for a third place from halfway through but it still was a great fun. I think I should rate game pretty high. Only bigger minus comes from the length. One of those games I won't be playing more than once (or twice max.) per year. :-)

Update (7.1.2007): After playing Serenissima & Imperial, it seems they give "same experience" as Civilization but take half the time to play. Therefore rating goes from 8 to 7.

Update (4.10.2008): After playing Adv. Civ. I decided to drop my rating from 7 to 6 for original since if I have 10+ hours to play civilization game, I'd rather play Advanced Civilization.

It's not everyone's cup of tea, but if you enjoy spending 10 hours+ with 6 of your mates playing a game like me it's great.  Start with 1 token and develop your civilisation.  Empire building game but with brilliant game balancing mechanics, making it more difficult to maintain a large empire

Same comments as Adv Civ. Long periods of downtime and thought, watching others cradle their civs, punctuated by a manic card trading period to create big-point sets and avoiding getting being passed a disaster. Bring on the schizophrenia. A fine game, but too long to hit the table and not enough reward for all the effort in the end.

It's a classic and a fun play.  But if the Advanced Civ expansion is available, I'd just about never play the original anymore.  The game can turn into a mathematics/management slog focusing on advances that seems to suck some of the life out of the end game as you're desperately trying to get the right number of points in a limited number of advances to move your way toward victory.

That said, the simple mechanics, strong player interaction, and reasonably low randomness factor make this a good game.  I'd just prefer to play the update over the original.

A favourite. Well worth seeking out if you have a large gaming group available. Caters for the non-conflict gamer as well as the more wragme oriented player.

Wonderful game, but you'll need to set aside 8-10 hours to play, but it is worth it and will be a memorable experience.  You have meeples on the mapboard of ancient Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and by expanding your populations you create cities which generate commodities (hides, silver, etc.) which you get as cards then you trade cards in the bazaar turn phase with the other players trying to corner the market on the commodities and earning points to advance your civilization.  A brilliant, imaginative game.

This game is wonderful.  Easy to grasp, only weaknesses are that it is best played with larger numbers of people and has a problem with many versus one coalitions ruining someones' fun.

Note:  After replaying this game recently, I have determined that the game must either be shortened or played in multiple sessions.

Played one short Intro game.  A very slick game for its time, and one that had lots of impact on euros.  Still, it's hard to bring this one to the table because of length, complexity, and the high # of players required.  Trading seems convoluted in the first run, too, though I imagine this becomes less of an issue as the game moves forward.

Also, the # of cards available in this version creates a bit of stagnation early on.

Best played with an odd number of players. There is a flaw in that a player who falls behind early, will never get all of the other players to fall a turn behind also; so there is no method for recovery in the game and for some civs. the turn loss is devastating.  Mare Nostrum has much of the same flavor and only takes 2-3 hours.

I love how smooth this plays, and how elegant combat works. I love the trading phase which keeps players engaged with each other even from across the table. I hate the length of the game. The game clicks along well enough until you hit this wall in the last 4th of the advancement track, where the requirement to proceed and advance the timer of the game becomes a massive amount of different tech cards. I would adore a more modern sped up version of this same system, but then, hasn't nearly every modern euro civ tried to live up to the promise of this game and fallen short?

I would have kept it, but honestly my tolerance for games of this length are just gone. I cap out at about 6 hours of time in a single game.

Too long and at times too random (yes you can avoid calamity cards if you're an expert counter but still other people can give you damage).

An "event" game. Very true to its theme of building your position. Conflict is to be minimized while you advance your position. Always enjoyed playing it. The only knock is the number of players and the time - however I found it no worse than 1870.

Ambivalent about advanced Civ it changed trading and the paths to victory at times I feel it was an improvement, other times I prefer the original game - it seems tighter.

I really don't like the complete dependancy on the actions of others in the game to determine who the winner is. You do not have a lot of control over your own destiny in the game, unless you have the negotiation skills of a used car salesman. Combine this with with fact that it lasts for an amazingly long time and a huge amount of down time between turns and it can make for a rather difficult game session.

Jan'2012 - Played again and had a better experience. I still think the game is quite random and out of your hands as to what happens, but it can be enjoyable if you know that going in. The entire success or failure in the game is based on trading, which is dependent on your ability to negotiate deals with other people.

Me and my friends played this and we spend whole nights with this game. I found the history theme a bit heavy and dry (I was 12 for god's sake) but enjoyed it more as I got older. A nice game, not for non-gamers though. Simple in mechanics, yet epic in scope.

EDIT: Played it again after almost 15 years. Still enjoy it, good pre-Euro / Euro mechanics although there is a lot of counting and bookkeeping involved which makes the game unnecessary fiddly and number-crunchy. Still, a great game. I will have to play this with more players in order to evaluate its true potential though. 

EDIT2: Played it again for the second time and it dragged on a bit. I feel that there is not enough happening to warrant the prolonged playing time and the calamities felt really unbalanced (flood does nothing sometimes, famine can wipe out an entire civilization). I noticed that the fun factor depends on how you play this game with. With wargamers and heavy euro games, Civ is lots of fun, but for connoisseurs of modern and more streamlined games, Civ can be quite tedious.

Great classic game whose strength and weakness are in the trading portion.  Strong because it's fun to try to make deals with your rivals, who may be looking to slip some horrific calamity into the deal.  But weak because it adds so much extra time to the game.  Many players also complain that it can be difficult, if not impossible, to catch up once you've fallen behind, a problem only exacerbated by the game's length.  But if you can look beyond the problems, this is a solid game remembered fondly by many older fans.

Apart from being the "original" Civ, the one that taught how to put together much more well-balanced games such as "Mare Nostrum" and "Vinci" (to briefly name but two), it could be a great game to this day -- if the "disaster cards" didn't keep reappearing to crush players over and over again, sending them back in the development timeline.

Rating would be a point higher except I just don't have time for such a long game.

My first experience was very negative.  While learning as Egyptians, I picked a poor civ development which made it impossible to win as it had too little value.  (I suppose I could have made up the difference with enough sets of trade cards...  ya right.)  The experienced players KNEW I was hosing myself and never mentioned this to me.  I was a contender to very end of 8 hour game and then discovered I had lost on turn 1.  (You can't throw away poor civ cards.)

I also didn't like the disasters in the trade deck.  Far too common and discouraged dealing.

This game is much better with the extra trade cards which you could buy from AH.

RATING: 9
Excellent Civ game that is thematic, has pretty elegant mechanics and really fun to play which reflects the rise, ebb and recovery of various civilisations.  It was fun and engaging to play despite the long duration needed. Definitely a game ahead of its time. Think its best played with 6 to 8 players with an optimal map size else the game is affected negatively (limited units and too much space is bad for tension levels).

My only issue is the conflict mechanics which while interesting, ensures that war become almost mostly "back and fro" attritional affairs where no "Alexander the  Great" decisive type of campaigns can ever be waged (not very realistic). There will many circumstances where you will sacrifice population in warfare just to keep their numbers in control which seems like a strange reason for war.

I love this game for its simplicity of rules, yet complexity of game dynamics. It is really quite a challenge to balance growth with building cities, advancing and expanding. In particular I love the fact that the original version of Civ necessitates that players cooperate while they are obviously in competition for winning. This is a very realistic premise and, I think, along with the calamities popping up now and then (or being handed to you) captures very well the precarious life of ancient civilizations, fighting each other, but actually/usually together fighting nature even harder for mankind to survive. It is a very elegant game, with some very subtle dynamics - I love it!

Played this game frequently a decade or so ago. Great fun, moving chits about on a map of the eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East. The trade and civilization cards add a lot of depth to this fun, albeit very lengthy, game. You need at least 3 players though.

One of the outstanding games of all time. Though it is a long game there are genuine swings in the style of play from the early building to the careful population management of the middle game, and the canny trading of the epoch transitions to the desperate attack scramble of the closing game.

Great game. I have played it once a year for 2 decades. I can't give it a ten. I always thought the trading was wrong. Players try to build up sets of the same type of goods. It should be the opposite. Players should try to get some of each. Also I found the population phase a bit too fidly. ALso I wanted to see the ebb and flow of individual nations not just civilizations.

A game I played a lot of back in the day. There were enough of us geeks in my college dormitory to get a six or seven player game together on a Saturday or Sunday. I rarely get to play it these days but am always up for it. It has great mechanics, a glorious theme, and is a satisfying play even if you don't win. The latter quality is especially important, since it takes a whole day to finish a game.

A clean, simple system with a bit of everything. Purists might disagree, but you can easily shorten the game just by imposing an end time. Leader at the end of that round being played is the winner. The same feel, but it lets you get to bed by 2am.

You've got to play it at least once.

[Home-made version]
A monster of a game that take 6-8 hours to play, it is worth every minute.  Players try to walk their civilization from the stone age thru the late iron age, building cities, waterways, and advancing their civilization which allows breakage of rules, all the while avoiding disasters/calamities.  Players interaction is a premium, as players try and barter goods.  But one must watch out, the goods don't have to be what you agreed upon...it could be a calamity coming your way.  This make a nice mix of diplomacy, as screwing the other guy too many times could result in some bad interaction in the way of military or starvation thru expansion of your opponents.

One of the best. A very rich and compelling game... some of the resource management features seem like they might have helped to inspire Settlers of Catan, but this game requires you to also deal with population growth, expansion, warfare and advancing your, you know, civilization.

I love it! Civilization is probably the first board game I adored. It's notoriously long to play, so don't invite any slowpokes or whiners to the table. Or have kids. Or something else to do all day. Come to think of it, when was the last time I actually dug out this time-sink? Unlike Merchants of Venus which I'm almost positive I've overrated just for sentimentality sake, I really do feel Civlization is a superb game if the time is available. I rarely play with the original trading rules, free trading is a lot simpler and faster, but it means you always get screwed with the calamities you draw.

A classic that may or may not have been improved by the Advanced edition.  I always had a bit more fun with the original, and it takes much less time to play.

RATING: 8.5
The first large boardgame I discovered as I was 15 yo. I was amazed by the story, the evolution of the civilizations, the trade, the treasons, etc. Before that, I'd played only RPG in a club and Monopoly with the family. I stayed all the night with the players, only to watch what was happening. I played Civilization many times after that and I'd like one day to take it out of my shelf and invite 6 mates to give it a new try. The only issue I've seen with this game is that you need to have solid players who don't get angry because they are swept out of the game after an "allied" backstabbed them.

xx Designed by the brilliant Francis Tresham this is surely one of the most influential games ever devised, (alongside the 18xx genre which he invented). It is said to have inspired the design of Sid Meier's Civilization computer game (which itself has spawned 2 boardgames) and which appears to be the basic model for Vlaada Chvatil's masterpiece, Through the Ages. Simple mechanics, lots of player interaction, simple rules and easy to play but tough to master. No dice - which, at the time it was first issued was very unusual. Above all - this is THE game that gave us the tech tree, a much used mechanic ever since. Perhaps there are better games around NOW, but for it's time, and for it's originality it is unquestionably a masterpiece - almost certainly the most innovative and influential board game design ever.

This is a true classic. The long playing time is the only fault. I think that the calamities are the main reason for that, as they keep the number of cities low and thus slow down the game. I should try a variant with less serious calamities.

Except a little thing, it's for me the best game I know.  The little thing is the length of the game (often more than 6 hours).
No random, a minimum of luck, not long and boring calculation to gain something.
It's a very good game.

[1 play] Admirable old pioneering AH game that still has strong appeal despite it's age and component quality. It may be hard to evaluate Civ fairly since so many games that have come after have taken ideas from the design.

I enjoyed learning this, and look forward to another game, but as always with these super lengthy games, I find myself measuring the fun and experience delivered against the amount of other great games that could be played within the same time frame and I am torn.

Most recent play 2-20-10 with Donovan, Michael, and Carter.

Got a player's copy (map torn but complete) off BGG. Thanks Ken.

Really like this one. It's very modern in design and in many ways predates most Eurogames. The game has a nice flow even though it has many phases. Players start by expanding their civ's terrain and then start building cities. There's much jockeying for position as players start conflict or negotiate for terrain. The trading system works well and Settlers of Catan was clearly inspired by this. The calamity cards can hit a player really hard but as the game is quite long, no player is really out of the game and can get back in fairly quickly.

As with games like Sword of Rome, any player that's perceived to be the leader gets clawed back, leaving other slower players a chance to catch up. The experience is great. My only gripe is that I wish that Civs were less 'generic'. Technology cards aside, there's no other way for a civ to gain an identity. Still, that's nitpicking. Wish this game were freely available so that other players can enjoy it too!

1980-hoz képest nagyon jó mechanizmussal bíró civilizációs játék. Kritika a kivitelezést illetheti, a térkép sajnos kicsi a jelölőkhöz. Nagyobb térkép vagy kisebb jelölők kellettek volna. A térkép pedig nagyon puritán. De 30 éves játékról van szó és így ezt sem érheti igazán kritika. A mechanizmus pedig nagyon jó, a harc egyszerű. A játék ugyanolyan dinamikus, mint a Dominant Species. Nagyon jól álló civilizációk is pillanatok alatt törpévé válhatnak egy-egy katasztrófa lap felhúzásával. A játékosok városokat húznak fel, ezek alapján pedig terménykártyákhoz jutnak, amiket fejlődés kártyákra cserélhetnek. Ezekből kell 1000-1400 pontot összegyűjteniük a játék végéig. Különböző feltételek vannak még egyes fejlődési részek eléréséhez, de kb. ennyi az egész játék. A 24 oldalas szabály ellenére nem bonyolult. Viszont nagyon számolós és nagyon hosszú. 3 játékos esetén is majdnem 6 órás volt a parti és még csak végig sem értünk. 7 játékos esetén tuti egész napos, viszont a kereskedés csak úgy működhet jól. Korát megelőző, jó játék a Civilization, de hosszúsága miatt nem nagyon szívesen ül le mellé az ember.

This one fully deserves the classic status it achieved. After first read through the rules, I was very much under the "there's nothing here" impression (in terms of representing the subject matter). I couldn't be more wrong: it was disconcerting to see to what an extent such simple, abstracted mechanics are capable of conveying the ebbs and flows of civilization. The exponential scaling of population and geometric scaling of monopolies are masterfully implemented, as well as the subtle way in which the necessity of trading forces reluctant cooperation, with possible evil twists, throughout the game. To my taste, this is still somewhat too abstract. Also, although in general I dig very long, slowly paced games, I understand how this may be perceived as a bit too repetitive by most modern gamers (the same calamities repeating too frequently may be frustrating).

Brilliant design, that has not worn well through the years.  For everything that is great about it, it has the one of the worst design flaws that you can put into a game.  At a certain point, it will become clear that certain players may be faced with the fact that they cannot fulfill the quotas to complete the game.  This can happen with hours left in the game. So there is no decisive protocol for those players.  What is their purpose?

That said, I give Advanced Civ a 10. It improves on the game in every way.  MANY MANY more interesting choices to be had. While vanilla Civ has its charm, it just became obsolete with the upgrade.

RATING: 7
I played this once and so far I really like it.  The game manages to demand a nuanced approach to protect a persons empire from multiple threats foreign and domestic with very few rules, pieces and turn steps.  I like efficiency in games.  I played this with 4 (Asia, Assyria, Babylon and Egypt) and didn't particularly like that Egypt and Asia have no early ability (or later, reason) to get at one another meaning Assyria and Babylon get it from all sides.

I can see this game being intended for more players but I'm not sure the massive amount time that would take would be worthwhile.  I would have liked to see the empires play differently with advantages and disadvantages instead of just different benchmarks for eras which I think exist to hobble those with better board position and don't represent cultural specialties.  Game play is pretty shallow for how long it takes but I would definitely play this again.

*When I got the Epidemic card, traded it to Egypt and with a stone face he in turn traded it to Asia was a game moment I will never forget*

Absolutely excellent.  
The only drawback is playing time, but that decreases as people get to know the game.  
A toss up as to whether I would play this or Advanced Civilization (which isn't so much an advanced version, as a variation).

Why did it take so darn long for me to play this game, especially considering that civilization games are my favorite? Probably because I thought it was outdated. Not so! This game more than holds its own against today's games. Engaging mechanics.

Conflict is integral to the design. It is a must for your civ to thrive. No phony VC's forcing the conflict. Long. Too long, but it still has that epic feel.

Those games used to last forever, yet were exilharating (at least in my memories of them) - I should mention that, at the time, just setting up a LAN party for computer multiplayer games with always-breaking networking cables would take 2+ hours anyway, so the length of Civilisation didn't bother us that much.

I remember losing one game due to kingmaking, but I suppose it must be hard to design game rules that could prevent that from happening.

What can I say except I love epic games and this is the king of epic games.  I've only ever played 3 complete games due to the length of time involved but I loved every session.  If it weren't so long to play I'm sure I could convince others to play it more often but I can say this is probably my favorite board game of all time.

One of the more difficult games for me to rate.  I finally had a chance to play it and I enjoyed the way the game unfolds, with different areas expanding.  I figured out a viable strategy after some initial mistakes and started making some good progress, only to have the game stopped after about 8 hours...noooooo!  The one complaint I have is the trading system-it's just a little out of left field for such a well designed game and doesn't seem to do it justice.  It's hard to block out that many hours and you do need the right group, especially people who keep the game moving and are at a roughly similar skill level.  I realize you can play a few good games in the time it takes to have one session of Civ, but I always feel that if a game is fun and engrossing, then I don't mind if my game time is spent on one or four games, as long as I'm having fun.  I really like the idea of Civilization games in general.  Hopefully I'll find some that give you the feel of expansion and progression that are shorter and therefore much more likely to hit the table.

Intrigued by this one and the way it manages to abstract so much compared to more modern civ games which are usually overloaded with cards, tiles, and options (plus the rather odd necessity to build wonders, as if they have any real bearing on a civilization's success--how did that quirk become so prevalent?). The immense skill factor needed to play well is also interesting to me.

I can see the game's appeal, but this is clearly not for me. It is way too long and with players with mixed experience and/or skill, the last few hours become a real torture for those that are behind. I'd rather play four or five meaty Euros in the same time span.

Fifteen years ago this was among my favourites, but now there are similar, more streamlined games that don't take an entire day to play. Another problem is the game often turns into a two or three horse race at the end which means some players have to carry on playing for another three of four hours even though they have no chance of winning. I'm afraid I'd rather spend my time playing five or six other games than play this again.

One of the most influential boardgames to have ever been devised. Why? Because the essence of the greatest turn based computer game of all time was born here. 

Still a great board game, it suffers from the significant length of time to play. A great game for a convention where people are keen to play and are prepared to put the time in.

I got this at Gencon' 07 auction at a comparative steal for $32, unpunched. The bidder after me paid twice that for Sid Meir's Civilization - the Boargdame. I got a deal - he got ripped off.

Likely won't play this again (by choice) is a 3.  I guess really that many more games fit this rating for me, but Civ is one of the few where I checked the chart before issuing my rating.

Bad, bad game.  Set collection with extreme luck introduced by the calamities and against a backdrop of a grossly unbalanced mapboard and a dull population expansion mechanic.  I honestly don't know what people see in this game.  This is, along with Kingmaker and to a lesser extent Dune, one of those games that even way back when I had little appetite for.

The interesting part about Civ to Adv Civ is the limit to number of cards you can have and available but the relative high required point totals to move forward on the AST. And coming out first on the AST is all that counts. Like to try that again.

I have the game but most of the parts are tied up in my Adv Civ game.

A really great game that is defined by the player interaction during trade. Great fun...but it does take so long, that we seldom managed to finish a game and it sadly doesn´t get played anymore these days.
Update 11/2010: Ok guys, come on. Let's be realistic: This game is not a 10 - only if you add a huge nostalgia factor. I LOVED Civ back in the days and we played it a lot. Yesterday we played a 10-hour game of Advanced Civ with five and I can't help but feel underwhelmed. Yes, the trading part is still good and I appreciate the realtively simple rules. But it's much more chaotic than I remembered and it just take too long. Much too long. Toooooooooooo long!!!
It's a classic. It's a great and groundbreaking design of it's day. But times have moved on.

Part of my Avalon Hill collection.
The advanced version makes this game even better and lets me give the Advanced version a Rate of 10.  Picked this up back when it came out from Avalon Hill.

This is the granddaddy of all Civ games and Tresham is one of the best designers out there.  Once I played the Advanced version I never went back and all the reasons you either love or hate Civ over A Civ are usually the same.  I cannot stand the Trade rules in Civ and much prefer those  in Adv Civ as well as the additions of the WXM and new trade commodities.  

Civilization by itself is an OK game but I really believe it needs the addition of the Advanced supplement that Avalon Hill added to this Gibson original.

Got 8 hours to spare? Play this. It's the sort of game that chews up the hours and can be quite infuriating, but it's a splendid investment if you have the time, sincethe gameplay is so good, and it's pretty hard - unless you play your nation rashly - to be completely out of it.

An excellent game marred only by the end game and the occasional impossibility of reaching a conclusion - usually resolved by calling the game a draw and breaking out another bottle of wine.

My copy is in German, so I can't play it as much as I'd like to, since I have to translate for people.  Still, the game is fun, and I keep wanting it to work out.  The mechanics are interesting (no luck in combat!!) and you do get that civ building feel.  The game system has controls incorporated to prevent runaway leader problems, providing a fun ebb and flow to the game balance.  Unfortunately, it takes a bit too long, so it doesn't come out much.

Not overly impressed with the game. The trading system dominates the entire game, so much so that the actual pieces on the board have almost no effect to who wins.  Also, the limited counters for gold/population makes no sense, and is very frustrating.

Really when I have a dedicated group for eight hours, it's a very tough choice between this, Republic of Rome, and Twilight Imperium.

UPDATE: It's not so tough a choice anymore. Republic of Rome has solidified itself as my preferred 'all dang day' game. Civilization is wonderful, and I am very glad I have had the chance to play it and look forward to playing it maybe once a year in the future, but ultimately I find it lacking for the time investment compared to other options.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Probably the best game ever designed. Over the course of play, only eventually do you need to know all of the rules, and very little randomness is involved, and none of it will break the game. Social pressure between you and other players creates a negotiation dynamic, and manageable turn order neither random nor based on where you sit creates the opportunity for a backstabbing dynamic. Still, not a war game but one about maintaining the status quo while slowly developing into abilities and advancement by way of the robust trading dynamic. Wonderful game.

This game is a beast. It takes several hours and at the end of them you are aware that you took your civilization to another place. It is an amazing game, with lots of interaction and the trade phase is a thing of genious, when coupled with the way advancements are bought and the catastrophes happen. There are so much back and forth, deals and alliances.

Is a game of deep strategy, as several things are linked - the expansion, the requirements, the advancements, the places and goods, etc. I do recommend the game to be played with a timer for the trade phase, as it can went pretty long if without restriction, but, in other hand, is very nice to enter in a negotiation battle. To this day, is still the best civilization game I have played.

Consider a rating of 8.5 if the game is played with a timer to limit the trade phase.

The trading per se and the first half are one of the better experiences in boardgaming. The second half (the suffering of catastrophes) takes too long for what it is and the game as a whole too, hence the reduction of points (I would not want to play this more than once per year).

Epic cornerstone of modern gaming. I played this once, so long ago it was another life. But what a great experience.

Would that there were ever time to play this beauty.  12 hours was my last game, 1992, and even then we'd only nearly finished! (7 players, mostly newbies)

Should this really rate a 10 - "will drop everything to play" type score.  Recently been trying to find time - but how easily can I sacrifice a whole day to play this again?  Caylus, PR, TI3, WotR and others I think give me the same feeling but for half as long... 

Ah well, still high on the nostalgia at the mo...

Rating is based mostly on extensive play of the [gameid=177] version, though I have played the vanilla version.  

Has a great epic feel, and the option to pursue military without it being the focus is a great design balance that has never been done better.  The duplication, spread, and technological advancement of your civilization is absolutely riveting, and provides a wonderful narrative, as well as a real empathy with your people.  Those are your guys, slowly spreading out and trying to struggle against calamities.  Nurture them!

The base game is a bit tighter than the expansion, though the tightness feels a bit artificial and out-of-place.  It results in a few interesting decisions, but by and large, the expansion does a better job of solving the same problems.  If you can find the expansion for less than an arm and a leg, it's worth purchasing.

In the 90th I loved the game and played it a lot. Nowadays I don't have the stomach for seemingly never ending games anymore. And this one is the most time consuming board game I ever played. Since it has no atmospheric qualities that might hold my heart for such a long time, it is no longer worth playing for me.

If I did not have such keen memories attached to the game, I would rather rate it 1 or 2. Even though I can understand why many people like it.

The passing of time, confusion with Advanced Civ, and the game's length (which length is overblown) have given this game a much lower rating than it deserves.

Perhaps best not to play with ditherers, but still, a classic boardgame.

I bought the original Hartland Trefoil version many years ago, I don't know if that differs from later versions. Looked at purely as a game it has its faults - very long, difficult to calculate card points for the less numerate. But as a social event we always found it worked. A bunch of friends round for a whole days gaming, booze and food based on the civ you're playing, nobody getting too precious. Excellent. But time is shorter nowadays and as a result it hasn't been played for a long time so I've reduced the score.

The length is long but the game is worth the time investment. One oughtn't mess it up with an expansion.

If you dont mind playing an epic game of grow and fester, this is the game for you. You need about 6 to 8 hours to finish this one , but the choices you have available are all good and make for an interesting game. Cities make money or goods to get points to buy technology to further strengthen your people. Not a wargame per se. You can kill people, but it's more like starving them than actually killing them. So it's about building and trading. I will almost always play this one when I have the time. Technology tracks are limited so if you would like more choice look to Advance Civilization.

This would be a 8 if it took less than 5 hours rather than the 10 that it does take.  I probably still haven't recovered from the 14 hour game we played at my 3-day long bachelor party retreat back in '94.  Still had fun with it though.

Update - Well, I finally bit the bullet and played Civ again--14 years after the last time.  We played with 5 and got the game done in 8.5 hours (including two players who are on the slow side).  All of us had fun, and I look forward to playing the game again.  I think playing with 5 and using good player aids makes the game playable and fun.

RATING: 5
Onec upon a time a long time ago this was my favourite game.  But there were few strategy games around at the time.  The gameplay is long and the structure fairly rigid, and the shopping elements 
The game seemed artificial in that the only winning condition was how far along the winning track you got, which depended very much on not getting hit by disasters in some critical turns when you were about to move forward.
I upgraded my game to Advanced Civilisation when it came along, which awarded winning based on points tracks but in all other aspects Adv Civ is much worse - the limits on the number of advances you can buy are removed, making those who get ahead uncatchable, and the shopping calculations are a nightmare, making the game incredibly long, and can make for a boring 7 hours if you get stuffed early in the game.  There is a lot better out there now, such as Antike.

No question why this is a classic. It has a compelling combination of simple moves with never enough resources and always too many setbacks. If only I could just manage to get... It does need close attention to bookkeeping though. Keep track of all your counters!

A friend of mine has this game 'solved', so the fact that I lose it every time has likely colored my comments. I simply can't stand this games plodding length; it is completely unrewarding. Update: I'm willing to give it another try.

One of the greatest games, but I like Advanced Civ better.  Competing for the limited technologies just isn't as fun as having them all available for all players as in Advanced Civ.  Still, this is a great game if you can get enough people to commit to 8+ hours of playing it (with lots of down time).

Epic comes to mind when I think about Civilization.  My first attempt at this combined both the Advanced Civ as well as the Western Expansion Map for a massive 8-player session.  It was astounding to witness the ebb and flow of the different empires throughout the game.  Unlike History of the World (which simulates the rise and fall of various civilizations over several periods) the board remained fairly static with the exceptions when barbarian hordes strike or civil war would break out.  Battles were few and far in between, with most of the game revolving around recovering and rebuilding after calamities (of which no one is safe from, especially those in the lead).  It seemed that shrewd trading was the key to eventual victory.  With the goods acting as the form of currency which allowed the purchases of technologies.  These advancements gave you certain protections, discounts as well as allowing you to move past the various ages on the A.S.T. and awarding you VP at the end.

Ambitious and long, I can now see why Civilization remained a classic and was definitely ahead of its time when it was released nearly 30 years ago.  Due to the enormous time committment required per game, and with many other similarly themed albeit shorter play duration available, I doubt I would revisit it very often.  Even so, it is a title that every serious boardgamer should try at least once.

One of the best game systems ever designed. The balance between  popuation, taxes and cities is great. The trade market with calamities add something more. Pratically the perfect game.

Great game with a little bit longish game time, but still in playable range. Simple and easy to follow rules that let the people play the game and not other way around. Absolutely one of my recent favourites. Only thing that little bothers me is the severity of civil war.

Keeping this because of the memories and the fact I can't justify a copy of MC. But it's nice to know where MC came from and is probably worth pulling out if we wish to do a nostalgia night with the MC-playing crowd.

7/19/17 - I really love this game.  It's simple, elegant, players are constantly involved in what's going on, and it has awesome trading/negotiation.  It's long, but the game is engaging throughout as the pacing tends to stay in a good zone.  The game does tend to slow down more than I'd like toward the end, as players engage in myriad calculations trying to figure out what they need to buy and whether or not they can afford it.  The last few times, however, we've played through to the last milestone marker on the AST, which removes the last 2 turns or so, and feel it gives a comparably satisfying conclusion while removing the longest few turns in the game.  It's definitely worth trying, if you agree with me about the slowdown during the endgame.

8/14/13 - Rating 8:  The most elegant of the meaty civilization games and, in my experience, the only one worth playing.  It's simple, keeps players perpetually engaged, and never sacrifices function for form.  It's long though--about 8-10 hours from start to finish, but the last few turns take up a huge portion of that, so we started playing to the final short-game marker and the game seems to end at about the right time.

Pro-tip:  bring along a pad of paper and pencil for each player.

The lesser cousin of WH battles. A well packaged boxed game that is suitable for short, sharp battles without the extended time in a standard WH battle.

The RPG component is a fantastic addition that makes the game flow with a storyline. 

The option for expansion from various models are a great plus.

Another nice idea ruined by the Games Workshop. Good setting, good miniatures, you just need few of them (and can take them from your collections instead of buying them, is this why is no longer officially produced?). The only flaw are the large (and difficult to store) cardboard ruined buildings.

The skirmishing cousin of Warhammer has its mechanics completely borrowed from its elder relative. This need to be compatible with Warhammere is the problem: this game is too light and simple for a skirmish.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Great setting.  I love character advancement in skirmish level games.  And yet IMO the Warhammer rules simply don't fit on a skirmish level miniatures game.  When rolling so few attack dice, the law of large numbers can't smooth out the probability such that I expect a nice result and may get a slightly better or slightly worse result.  I recommend MageKnight for a good ruleset...but then you lose the character advancement.

RATING: 6.5
Great theme - and when using painted miniatures and buildings, this game looks fantastic. The rules are great but maybe just a wee bit too simple to make it really tactical. You're inclined to just run towards the opponent and beat him with a stick. I think that too many statistics just happen on paper, but tactically they don't have enough impact to change your playing strategy.

I liked it, but I liked Necromunda a lot better.  With so much terrain, I just think a shooting heavy game is much more appropriate rather than a hand to hand game.

A great miniatures game for those who like to craft.  Skirmish-level combat means you don't need to own a lot of miniatures, and campaign rules allow for improvement (or debilitating injury) for your warband.  Making your own terrain for this game is easy and allows for a lot of creativity.  It has fast and fun game play, but there are a few mechanics that don't work very well, or promote min/maxing in unusual ways.  Even so, I highly recommend it.

Supposedly the best of Games Workshop skirmish games. I really like the radical departure from Warhammer Fantasy Battle towards skirmish games built around teams of characters and henchmen. Gives the game a strong RPG flavor without getting too bogged down in the details of most miniatures systems and RPGs.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is my favorite GW game.  It has the depth and complexity, the strategy, the hobby aspects, the role-play aspects and doesn't take a fortune to get into or a lifetime to learn.  It is a dark game (the manual), but playing a series of games and watching your team improve couldn't get more fun.

If you like this type of game, have the money, the time, the space and someone to play against, get it. 

This game doesn't get a higher rating mainly because of the difficulty of finding someone to play it.  I have many other games that I can spend ten minutes and teach someone and have a good game, but this one is, "hey do you want to play a game with me - next month!"

Great theme, great rules, great fun!
The thing that sets this game apart from other minis games is that your warband and your characters grow and gain new weapons/equipment over the course of multiple games.

I'm proud to say that I have every issue of Town Cryer! (Both the issues that were part of White Dwarf magazine AND every issue from when it was it's own separate magazine)

RATING: 7
Pros:  fills my squad-based minis game itch, good components (love the artwork), satisfies the miniatures wargame urge for half the cost and half the time.  Cons:  quite a few rules are broken as written, requires house rules to address the broken rules and game imbalance, additional terrain is required to create a more intense game.

Own a Skaven warband and an Imperial (Nuln) warband plus 20 guys on sprue.

As well as a small selection of figures from 6 WFB armies (Dwarves, High Elves, Goblins, Tomb Kings, Beastmen, Chaos) to make "warbands" with, including:

Khorne -

1 Lord (Korghos Khul)
1 Lord (Exalted Deathbringer) on Bloodthrone
3 Bloodletters on Juggernaughts
4 Flesh Hounds
8 Bloodletters
8 Cultists (Bloodreavers)
*8 Khorngors

Nurgle -

*1 Lord (Gutrot Spume)
1 *Lord on Beast
3 Nurglings
3 Plaguebearers on Drones
7 Plaguebearers
*7 Cultists (Blightkings)
*7 Pestilens Skaven

Slaanesh -

*1 Lord (?)
1 Lord on Daemonic Mount
2 Fiends
3 Seekers on Steeds (Diaz sculpts)
6 Daemonettes (Diaz sculpts)
6 Cultists (Witch Elves)
*6 Slaangors

Tzeentch - 

1 Sorcerer Lord (Gaunt Summoner)
1 Sorcerer Lord (Magister) on Disc
2 Pink Horrors on Discs
3 Flamers
3 Screamers
9 Pink Horrors (+ 4 Blue & 4 Brimstone Horrors)
9 Cultists (Kairic; but prefer robed cultists)
9 Tzaangors

Fun campaign game development makes this system shine.  I prefer it a bit to Necromunda because of the greater variation in bands/gangs.

A pretty decent miniatures skirmish game (though I like Necromunda more).  The miniatures are very nice and I use them in my RPGs set in the WFRP universe... a setting which I absolutely love and ran a three year D&D campaign in.  Has many similarities to Necromunda, but I felt the scheme for character advancement and gang creation was much better in Necromunda.

This game has everything I love about RPGs. It is the board game version of Final Fantasy Tactics (My all time favorite video game).

I don't know what to rate this game - it's lots of fun, and I never play it :) I played it heavily for about a year after getting it, and spent loads of time painting the minis and building terrain (probably as much as actually playing). However, I find it takes too much time and effort to get into lately; between setup, gameplay, and cleanup this can easily take 3-4 hours to play - a far cry from Warhammer, but when we could play three other games in the same time frame, with more time dedicated to playing and less to setup, Mordheim takes a back seat.

Ads great things to Warhammer.  Persistence, stats, story, weapon differences, awesome goodness.  But held down by some Warhammer holdovers.  Armor sucks, magic isn't fun.  It has a runaway leader problem in campaign, but by the time you get to that point you have had months of good times.  Oh, and the ability to buy new items for your guys is in direct opposition to not selling miniatures that you can actually customize.  Not sure how to fix that except to say "this guy can't afford his weapon yet, so pretend it is a knife".

This is almost as good as Blood Bowl, and provides a great rules system for skirmish battles in the Warhammer universe.  The rules for experience are exciting.  The shard rolls at the end of the game should probably be made less difficult.   Ideal for campaigns, if you have lots and lots of space to set up multiple games, because the game plays best with 2.

RATING: 6
Minatures game that im playing ATM.

Very random, to a punishing level. Dice rolls come close to being more important than your strategy. Encourages very gamy tactics like holding up in a building and forcing your opponent to come and get you or the game will last forever.

Some of the warbands aren't really balanced (the Elves)

However if you can get into it more as a story/roleplaying experience it can be good fun. I tend to find 4 or 5 way battles more interesting than 1v1.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I maybe like this more that Necromunda? No, I take it back. 

Some nifty additions to the formula, such as by having attachments of mercs that advance together, and the greater diversity of faction outfits. 

Love the advancement system for campaigns, which might even rival that of Necromunda. Town Cryer also added a lot of support in terms of scenarios, settings, new gangs, monsters, etc. 

The terrain in the box seems really cool, but it falls apart easily, and can't be taken apart and put back in the box as easily as Necromunda's cardboard + plastic system. Looks great, and is evocative of the setting, but I usually play without it due to how finicky it can be. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Why does this get a 10 from me?

First, I should note that this is a miniatures game.  From my point of view a miniatures game is a boardgame, save that the bits tend to be incredibly elaborate.  So because of that I have no problem with the rules systems being on BBG.

I really like nice looking games with cool bits and so a well put together miniatures game gives a level of palpability that a lot of other games can not achieve.  The miniature aspect draws me into another world, which is something that I'm very keen on having as an experience in a game.

Now, a lot of miniature games require you to invest a huge amount of time and money into one game system.  It becomes a hobby in it's own right as you prepare your figures, spend a lot of time setting up games and then finally playing them.

Mordheim is an exception, relatively speaking, from your more traditional miniatures game.  Instead of collecting and painting hundreds of figures you only have to deal with 10-20 figures, which comprises your warband.

The terrain, while potentially infinitely complex if desired, comes packaged with the game with enough detail and elaboration to provide a wealth of use for the average gamer.  The terrain stresses three dimensions and so a lot of angular, "lets get down at eyeview with our figures" type of gameplay comes about.  This is always fun and ads to the palpability I mentioned before.

The game comes with a campaign system that is both competitive but also forgiving.   Each scenerio is competed against another player but at the end both sides tend to get some type of development with their warband.  So over time you get to customize your strategies and ad extra detail that ads more veracity to the gameplay.

Lastly, the scenerios are normally very quick to play and so it's possible to play a number of them in a single evening, something that many euro gamers already appreciate.

So overall, if someone wants to get into a miniatures game, but feels daunted by the vast time/money sink that it can create, I'd suggest this as a wonderful balance of everything miniatures has to offer, with a huge amount of game material crammed into the system, but not overwhelming in terms of a hobby.

It has been sitting in my attic for years. My wife had bought it for me when we were dating. She thought I would like to paint the miniature or something.  Well I soon realized it wasn't my thing and never did much with it.  The majority of the miniatures are still connect to the mold holder things.  The box is in ok shape but not mint. Like I said it h been sitting in my attic for quite a long time.

Anyone interested in this let me know I can take and send pictures of it so you know what you're getting if you're interested in buying or trading for it.

The second best tabletop miniature wargame I ever played. Yes it is a GW game with the famous FAQ, emends, add-ons, etc, etc. But the feeling of playing it from game to game in a series or a campaign and seeing your warband evolving and growing up from game to game is great. The best all alone GW game. The best is that now is free. The rules are available to download and you can use any kind of miniatures. If the guys you play with aren't peeky, you can use proxy figures to represent whatever figure you want and still have a blast at it.

RATING: 3
I like this kind of game, but I feel luck is way too important in this particular one.  In theory good rolls should cancel out bad ones in this kind of dice fest, but in practice I roll good on the unimportant rolls and bad on the important ones. The result is that I fall behind in a campaign, and there's only so many times that can happen before playing catch-up gets old.  I've reached that point, so it's unlikely you could get me to play in another campaign.  Still, I might recommend it to others interested in this style of game.

Another great specialist game that GW has let die, since it doesn't sell loads of minis.
Either way, it's still a great skirmish game despite the later warbands being really overpowered.
I still love my Witch Hunters.

The best small scale miniatures game GW has ever produced, and the best gateway into the hobby. The campaign system adds that much-needed character progression, and not needing more than 20 models is definitely a plus.

It uses the standard GW 'system' of rules, with some minor modifications, and the system works surprisingly well, and is very efficient for games of this small size. I can't imagine how clunky the system must get with large armies like WFB, and 40K (haven't played either personally, but I'm familiar with the rules systems).

Since the rulebook is free now, one can get into the game pretty cheap, but springing for the boxed set, when available is a much wiser choice, since everything two people need to play is in the box. The cardstock buildings are quite nice as well, when mounted and decorated properly.

Terrible, unbalanced random die-rolling combat in the worst GW tradition, accompanied by some awful, flimsy components.   I let this game collect dust unopened for years, then struggled to assemble the crappy card buildings and learn all the rules... only to instantly regret it.  It's basically the same dull, clunky gameplay as Warhammer, only with less miniatures.

You need only a couple of miniatures, and they can 'improve' from game to game - something I like in minature games.

The downside is the fact that you need terrain pieces to make the game interesting, which can be problematic to store.

Only only two games with the Witch Hunters under my belt. Generally speaking I would like to see that upgraded minis would like that. The minis do always look the same, doesn't matter if I say my chief has a pistol and a shield in this hand or some double handed weapon. OK, this is not easy for a minis game to be such customizeable, but then I would still prefer it. Constantly looking up up numbers in tables isn't that attractive eihter but all in all it was still a pleasing game.

It's got personality, a great campaign/experience system, and it comes with neat-o terrain--all of that helps to compensate for the sad fact that it needs slight rules tweaking (dual-wield) and is basically a dicefest. Eager to try Necromunda to compare.

This is a great game, but has some balance issues in extended campaigns. Games Workshop / Specialist Games have really shot themselves in the foot by not continuing to publish the box sets, as it was one of the last games you could buy and play without further purchase (well, for a while...)

Hooray, got this game for free from the specialist games website.  Well I say 'free' I did end up going out and buying loads of GW minis and paints to start my gang.  Maybe these GW guys aren't as daft as we think.

This game is probably best game Games Workshop has ever done! Models and stuff this game has are good looking and you pretty much enjoy every game u play (unless with very very bad day with dices :P ). Making your own scenery and painting models makes games always much better than to play with non-painted models and cardboard buildings.

Like alot of the GW games, the smaller games are much tighter and more fun to play.  While I think Necromunda is a better game, Mordheim is streamlined and its always easier for fantasy to hit my table. Alot of fun for little investment if you want to try small-scale skirmish miniatures gaming.

I dislike the forced cohesion that henchmen mobs have.  Some of the gangs are MUCH stronger than others.  The Skaven get excellent Skaven only skills and equipment and one more hero than every other faction.  Heroes determine income, meaning that an already strong gang, with an extra hero, just gets stronger.  Blackpowder weapons are very expensive, and are terrible.  Armor is also extremely pricey, and also useless.  Was this game playtested at all?  Necromunda is much better balanced, and is a better game over-all.

The rating is with the numerous house rules we've included to help this game along. It's one of the few Warhammer games that requires only a [i]small[/i] fortune to play, since the number of models is limited. The campaign aspect is quite good (though still very random), especially since even warbands who "lose" on the battlefield still have a decent chance of progressing.

Super hard to get into, as there are tons of articles scattered to the four winds with balance improvements. But once you get past that, the game is very thematic, offering the best progression and campaign rules I've ever seen, even if we add tabletop RPGs and video games to the mix. The wounds system is just brilliant. Not worth playing in one-shots, though.

Art in the book is fantastic. Backround story is highly entertaining for warhammer buffs. As cool as the campaign system in Necromunda was, Mordheim missed the mark a bit. There wasn't the same feeling of progress as Necromunda as there are no territories to control. Archery was also too powerful. Close combat between experienced combatants had some problems as well (very much unlike Necromunda). Fun until we burned out on it.

RATING: 8
In general, GW games don't do much to hook me: too random, too expensive, and most of all too temporary.  Mordheim remedies most of my complaints, especially when played as a campaign which gives you the opportunity to progressively level up the members in your squad, doing a little dice tuning in addition to dealing with some cool rpg aspects.  What's more, while GW more or less kicked the game to the curb, the fans have done a great job keeping it alive with a handful of well put together expansions, adding new races, equipment, environmental rules, events, and so on, meaning there is a huge amount of game out there for free.  A single match can take 30 minutes, meaning in the right group on a good day you can see the rise and fall of your band of heroes through to completion, and few campaign experiences offer that.  Again, it is still GW, so it is still heavily dice dependent and often times unbalanced, but the speed of play and the amount of content are enough to make it worth exploring.

One of the best satellite games GW has ever published. Excellent rules, and an extremely fun campaign systems that allows your warband and its members gain experience, equipment, and abilities over time.

Almost as much as with Warhammer and WH40K, this is more of a whole hobby than a board game. It is very thematic (VERY, VERY, VERY!) and enjoyable, and it is by far not as daunting to collect and paint enough minis as with mainstream GW games. If you like hobbies and crafts, as well boardgames, than this is the one for you! Beware though, it takes time, time, time...

I loved Mordheim, if only I could get the time together to build, paint and play this game! So many options and smaller, easier to buy teams makes this game much more preferable to Warhammer Fantasy. I miss playing it a lot!

At the same time I also remember the many faults with this game- you need lots of scenery (70%+ tabletop coverage is recommended), overpowered ranged attacks, complete lack of balance between warbands and rules that leave so many gaps for the dedicated player you have to spend most of the time making stuff up or vainly checking the rulesbook.

Check out the frankly incredible rewrite of the base game at www.coreheim.com! Just reading this excites me to want to try it- this ruleset includes a strong attempt to correct all of the above problems and tightens GW's vague and unspecific ruleset.

It looks awesome.

The fantasy cousin to Necromunda, a game of 'squad'-level combat in the Games Workshop Warhammer universe.

As with Necromunda, these sorts of games always seem better on paper than they play. I love buying my warband and thinking about strategy (never really that complicated in this type of game), but once you start to play it just degenerates into a fairly random dice fest, and I always finish feeling a little dissatisfied. I suspect that these sorts of games are all about the miniatures; getting to move your cool little figures around is all well and good, but I feel like I need a bit more strategy in my wargame.

(By the by, I think Necromunda is actually a superior game to this one. The fact that Necromunda has rules for pinning, and more complicated cover rules, tends to make it a bit more strategic. Mordheim dumbs down the missile weapon rules in favor of a more melee-oriented combat system, which IMO is a lot less interesting.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Best simulationist skirmish combat system in my book, simple and low-logistics.
Competitive tactical combat meets seamless narrative generated by in-game events. Amazing cinematic actions occur every game! Nobody is safe in Mordheim!
Rules are an easy pick for any RPG fan, intuitive mechanics, and infinite potential for expanding the game through scenarios, supplements, campaigns or game modes.

RATING: 8
if you are prepared to fix some of the broken rules and have a good group of players who aren't beardie cheaters - this game is brilliant in campaign mode.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This was a good game and I don't know why it's discontinued, considering GW is not offering anything like this at the moment.

This is a miniatures game without the burden of having to buy a huge amount of armies and minis, you can play with just a bunch of them in a small space (compared to warhammer)

The idea of including RPG elements and customizing and equippping every unit is great, especially if you go the extra step of assembling your minis matching your equipment.

I like the grim fantasy / ruined city a lot more that the generic fantasy theme, so this is a plus too

The problem with this game is also it's main attractive, that is having your band of characters evolve from play to play. The winner gets stronger, so he's more likely to win on the next match. After a while you'll have to start over with fresh bands and stats because the bands will be unbalanced...

I have more fun immersing myself in this game than any other (emphasis on the word immerse). This game is a fun one with casual play, but it's most endearing aspects are brought about from fully embracing it as a hobby. Developing a warband over weeks of campaigning, and constructing a miniature ruined city from scratch are what make this game truly stand out.

I own a Sisters of Sigmar warband.

The game has much potential: a smaller scale miniature game in the Warhammer world! The idea of recruiting your own warband in which many has his/her own abilities and unique statistics is just great. Only one box is needed and after that you are ready to play - even the rulebook is free nowadays.

The system is simple and with even a bit of WH experience, easy to learn in a couple of minutes. Too bad that GW doesn't support this game anymore...

Instead of putting together a large Fantasy army with hundreds of figs you can assemble a small warband and play through a few games in an evening.

One of the two best game GW ever made. This and Necromunda are essentially the same thing, just ones Fantasy based and the other Sci-Fi.

Both are excellent. But beware the high cost of getting into these at such a late stage in the game if you intend to buy "official" Gw models and terrain for them as they have been out of print for ages.

If however you and your opponent don't mind proxying other cheaper figures and scenery and using the free downloadable rules still available of GW's website, then why arn't you playing this RIGHT NOW! Really, these games are EXCELLENT FUN!

I've left a session report.  Many of the issues were the product of my home-grown scenario, but I'm not generally a fan of the ponderous GW roll-to-hit, roll-to-parry, roll-to-wound, roll-for-armor-save, roll-for-good-measure system, after all of which nothing decisive happens.  I had hoped that this would be a little more bearable in Mordheim, since the number of figures involved is so much less than in a typical WH game, and I suppose it did.  But there was little tension, since most of the die rolls, after all the calculations, turned out to be about a 50% chance to succeed.  Try as I may, I continue to find the GW rules system to be far more tedious than fun.

My rating is a combination for both the rules system and the background & setting of the game. Without the grim, gritty and atmospheric Warhammer world Mordheim would be less.

You only need a handful of figures so huge investments normally associated with miniature games are not neccessary. Of course Mordheim can be quite a project if you really want to build an impressive game table.

Nah. Complicated, fiddly, stupid sighting rules (real line of sight...), also it is a skirmish game. Does not work well for me at all.

Potentially the best Games Workshop game ever.  We have played this game for countless hours.  One offs, exteneded campaigns, multi-players we have played them all and had a great time.  This game is the original, don&#039;t play warahmmer skirmish as it is only Mordheim lite.  I have Possessed, Undead, Skaven,  and Orcs and Goblins.

Affordable and highly playable alternative for bigger scale miniature wargames such as Warhammer.

A strong squad-based fantasy miniatures game, with lots of personality in the warbands that you can customize, cool scenarios, and RPG elements that make campaigns a blast. Best of all, it only takes 10 or so minis to start playing, so the game is inexpensive as far as miniatures gaming goes. Some of the warbands (especially expansion ones) aren't balanced exceptionally well, but you probably won't notice until you've played a half-dozen games or so. Great entry into the miniatures world for fantasy fans.

The best miniature game without a board I ever played.
Fast, intriguing, easy to learn and teach, and playable with every miniature/building you want. A terrain could be formed with books, pencils and rubbers.

Mordheim, which really should be named Warhammer Fantasy Skirmish, may not be the best skirmish style tabletop game around, but it is the only one that I still play occasionally. The box offers everything you need to play a serious two player game: High quality cardboard-with-plastic houses (ruins), two customizable warbands and a glossy rulebook. The game is pretty random due the frequent dice rolls, and its many rules can make it a bit fiddly at times, but it also is very action oriented and drenched in atmosphere. Furthermore, once set up, it is beautiful to look at. Finally, it enables you to deploy almost any finely crafted Warhammer Fantasy miniature you like.

Wow! Superb miniature skirmish game. Gang warfare Fantasy style.Much under rated game. Serious gamers should'nt let the Games Workshop tag put them off. Whats that all about any way. Yeah sure some of the suff is expensive but the starter sets are great value, and you are always assured of a quality product, with plenty of support.

A great tactical miniatures game.  One barrier to entry into tabletop miniatures gaming is the sheer amount of time and money it takes to buy and paint an army.  Yet another is the time it takes to actually play the game itself.  Mordheim solves both of these because of the small scale of the setting.  Each player controls a small warband (3-20 miniatures), which makes it easy to get new players into the game.  The games are also much shorter, allowing multiple games in an evening.  The best part is the advancement aspects of the game.  After each battle your warband gains experience, adding some role-playing aspects of character advancement.  The warband can also grow in numbers as it obtains more wealth.  The game also plays well with more than 2 players.

Playable with more than 2.  Additional rules and warband rules available in the Town Cryer magazine from Games Workshop's Black Library. I converted to this after getting rid of my warhammer fantasy armies - no need for a lot of models in this.

GW's second smaller scale  miniatures game (the 1st being necromunda). Essentially a fantasy version of necromunda, the game is one of  gangs fighting for treasure in a devastated city, the basic box has enough  minatures (humans and skaven) and terrain to play after assembly, but as the case of all GW games you will almost certainly need more and more and m....  The rules are  Warhammer with a few more details; parrying, helmets, variable wounding etc, nicely done in a well produced rulebook (although not up to the orgiatsic spectacle that is GW's present level of production. Fun with one off games but only really shines when played in a league. The community on the web for a supposedly "dead" game is very impressive, theer are new settings; dwarfen underground labyrinthe, deserty undead arabay, sweaty jungle and rural empire, dozens of new gangs to play; pirates, ogres, amazons, orcs, etc, etc. The fan base it seems will not let the game die :). The figures and game are still avalaible on the GW specialist sight but as with most anything GW you are going to have to pay alot for the things! That said the rulebook and oodles of extra stuff is avalaible for free on the Specialist games sight and you are free to use your own  miniatures and terrain. All in all a fun game

This is a hard core game that is not for the casual player.  It requires a lot of investment in buying the figures for your army, time to paint them, and finding a good group that know the rules well.  If you can find all theta, this game is fantastic.

 This can be real hit or miss. For me it is best when it is at it's simplest. If you try to complicate it too much you dilute it's core too much and it is just lacking.

I greatly enjoy Mordheim!  I love the theme, I love the look, I love pretty much everything about it.

You quickly begin to care for your warband, begrudging each wound inflicted upon it, biding your time for revenge during a future skirmish.

My only complaint is the upkeep.  If one of my characters finds a rope, then I've got to model and paint a rope and attach it to my model.  If one of my characters loses some equipment (or an arm, for example), I've got to similarly reflect that on my model.  The solution is to do a lot of modelling and painting between games (and I'm VERY slow at both), or to have 3 or 4 times as many figures as you need for your warband, each modelled slightly differently to swap in and out as needed.

Other than that ... I love it.

Great skirmish game. Takes some time to prepare with all the scenery and painting, but after that pretty fast to play once you have everything ready and listed.

If you like Necromunda I think you like this one too.

*I've got the free rulebook, some scenery and tons of Warhammer models.  I've played in a tournament and a couple of solo games, so I guess I own this.  Anyhow, fantastic and atmospheric skirmish game.

I'd love to pick up the boxed set at some point for those cardstock buildings, but it doesn't look likely.  And besides, there's not much more room under the stairs ...

[i]GW game. The game isn't annoying, but the publisher is, to a degree that I will not play or support their products. Orginally rated this a 6, but GW just sucks the fun out of playing their games. Original comment:[/i] Played this for a reasonable time. Looking back at that period, Mordheim seems to be either Warhammer without an army or Dungeons and Dragons without a story

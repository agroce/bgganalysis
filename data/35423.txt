Crisp and exciting.
I have the PnP version, and have found the solitare variant excellent too. I was initially disappointed that there was no Congressional voting on Issues, but those votes still count for the all important drafting of Offices in the Division of Spoils phase added before The Issues in the 'Less Negotiation' variant that the solo variant uses. So no waste there! Try scenario C for an afternoons fun...

Most enjoyable, well worth the day that the full game requires. An epic view of American history from the Founders to the Civil War. Very nicely produced.

RATING: 10
A few years ago I discovered the original design of Rick on BoardGameGeek, and I immediately realised the great potentials of this game. The original artwork was a rude black and white prototype. I waited for almost three years, hoping a nice graphically appealing version would come out at sometime. In the end I decided to undertake this big project with Rick, and after several months of hard work, we finally delivered this gorgeous graphic edition of Founding Fathers. It's not only greatly improved in its look & feel, but it also contains several new cards, new game mechanics that improve players interactions and backstabbing, a more intuitive and detailed rules booklet, and much much more...

Update: I improve my rating to 9 after the first Expansion "Offices & Statesmen" has been published. Then I raised again my rating to 9.5 after seeing most recent improvements, clarifications and corrections; the game is now close to being a true gem!

Update 3/2017: played with the Ladies & Orators expansion, the game has reached the perfect balancing and fun! Want to play it again and again!

RATING: 8
I've been continuing to enjoy this, but the pacing feels just a touch off. I wonder if picking 5 issues per turn instead of 4 might speed it up just enough? Not sure. Also, the game might benefit from allowing Statesmen to voluntarily retire and cash in their influence. Right now, it's possible to get stuck with a popular, unelectable faction leader (due to home state) which makes the election process a little boring. It might be nice if other party members could pay off a dud party leader to retire. Not sure though.

Also, I think the sweet spot is probably 4 players. It's a negotiation game, but you just don't have as many levers as you do in Republic of Rome, so more players just makes things more complicated and take longer without really making it a deeper game. Fewer players lets you move through the inevitable dead spots where your faction is too small to get anything done a bit faster.
---
Just a couple brief comments, as my one game (so far) went badly off the rails, at no fault of the game itself.

Firstly, understand it's a negotiation game. It's based on the Republic of Rome engine, and while it's not as intense or as unpredictable as that game and neither is the US very likely to fall (other than to the inevitable Civil War), it's basically the same sort of game and you still want to remember your votes should have a price if they aren't playing into your interests. The President has a number of tools at his discretion, and you should be getting a cabinet appointment at the very least. IPs are also good, at least in some quantity. Anyway, make the deals to form coalitions. That's the heart of the game. The early American Republic historically had plenty of political infighting and was at the point of brutal partisan warfare by the time of Andrew Jackson.

Secondly, the game does need to move at a decent clip. The rating on the box (2hr+) is, um, hugely optimistic. I think even a little bit of familiarity will cut the time down substantially (and Republic of Rome vets will have a big advantage here), but your first game play just the first deck and try to keep the game moving. The other reason this is important is because the turn-to-turn situation is less politically fluid than Republic of Rome, with presidential election nominations and outcomes substantially favoring incumbents with much less  direct player control (and with little in the way of assassinations or tribunes). Popular statesmen win elections, regardless of votes in the legislature. Party leaders will get elected and power will get entrenched, before ultimately they are forced to retire. Individual players will be in the driver's seat for a turn or two, with other players angling to incrementally improve their position and replace them later. While you're in the presidency and driving the game, other players are mostly waiting their turn - the president has vastly more power and control than even a Dictator in Republic of Rome. So be thoughtful, but for the love of all that is holy it is your social responsibility to keep the game moving or it will absolutely die for everyone else, especially if you are just staring at cards trying to plot instead of negotiating. Do the 4 issues you have to deal with as a package deal if you can, which should work most of the time. Don't screw around and waste everyone's time, just make the deals you need to make. The statesmen's party affiliations make for a pretty clear starting point for what is in whose interest.

Like Republic of Rome, more players is not always better I think. 4 is probably the sweet spot. Republic of Rome actually works surprisingly well with 3; not sure if Founding Fathers would as well, but I certainly wouldn't rule it out.

While the rules for Elections seem hugely sketchy on paper, they seem to basically work when combined with the number of action cards that can mess with the vote count. It seems like a better system should not be beyond the wit of man, but this does play fast and it does the job. For reference: it's probably in everyone's interest to ratify the 12th Amendment. It makes coalition-building and deal-making easier. The free-for-all at-start  system makes it harder for the President to get the votes he needs to pass issues once elected.

I haven't figured out the politics on getting states admitted to the Union yet. The stakes are low, they don't have a ton of electoral votes and gives the president a point of popularity, but it does open up the game (more statesmen, more ways elections can go). Admitting southern states will break up the northern politicians' lock on power, so is probably something you want to do on general principals unless you have a lock on the northern states (unlikely). A game that stuck to the original states wouldn't be that interesting, but then again there isn't that much motivation for out-of-power factions to vote for the admissions - especially since the size of the US doesn't seem to affect tax or tariff revenue (or did I miss it?).

Anyway, it's hard for me to judge because my one game did get sabotaged, but I think there is a lot to appreciate here if you enjoy the history - especially for fans of Republic of Rome or people who like the Sierra Madre Games aesthetic. It's definitely not as tight nor does it have the range of a High Frontier, Pax Porfiriana, or Greenland, but it's a clean, playable system - pretty much the same complexity ballpark as a euro like Panamax or Die Macher - with a nice physical design and covering a really interesting period. If this idea sounds appealing you should give it a try.

Get's an 8 out of the gate for being a rip-roaring experience. It is as Eklund-y as you are going to get without being a Phil Eklund game.

I'm not sure we really got a good feel for how to play well in our first game, but we sure had a fine time.

So steeped in the history, chock full of short-term shennanigans, interesting negotiation space, long-term ebb and flow... I'm very into what this game might turn out to be. And I certainly like what it did for us.

RATING: 9
I’m a certified Republic of Rome fanboi and an antebellum US history dorkwad so this is a title that flips all my switches — not ready (yet) to declare it the GOAT but I’ll happily call this a huge winner in my book. Like RoR, there’s some room for strategic  maneuvering but part of the charm is just seeing the direction that history takes you. The game is in the negotiations  — you win or lose by extracting a little bit of surplus value from a series of win-win deals. Like any negotiation game the game gives you the tools you need to strike those deals but learning the value of what you have is up to you.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.2
This is a really impressive distillation of Republic of Rome that seems both more streamlined and more interesting.   If further play continues to support my initial feelings, this game is a considerable accomplishment.  

If you've always wanted to play RoR but were scared by the long rules and epic playtime, this game is for you.  If you've played RoR but wish the game had deeper engagement with matters outside of war, this game is for you.  If you have an interest in US political history, this game is for you.

Really wanted my group to play this game, it didn't happen.  The rules are tough to get your head around.  The rules as written take a lot of figuring out.  My brainiac rules lawyer just gave up.  So now I am attempting to write a process document to play.  It would be great if there was an extended play book along with this game.  I will upgrade my rating once the group can play it.

Gorgeous, engrossing, and it marks a streamlined improvement on the addictive Republic of Rome game engine. A great "experience" game if you 're a history nut, and a fun playing experience to boot. I found the solution to the fluid party identities over the nation's first ~70 years under the Constitution to be elegant. If there's an expansion to add additional politicians (and extra blocks), I'm in.

US History is something I never lost time in, I don't dislike it but I don't like it neither. Anyways the game is a 10, it's immersive, quick, it has the best of Republic and nothing of the bad without being a clone, and it makes you think you are one of the big lobbies behind the statesmen (the factions) maneuvering to position the "right" people to win the presidency (sometimes I think it's like playing House of Cards).

And the graphic design is perfect, I like it a lot and it's a big part of the "immersive" feeling of the game. Without it I'm not sure I would have bought the game (because as I said US History don't appeal to me). Good job

Republic of Rome without the hassle. The rulebook is quite good (a few holes here and there). Must be played with at least four and the expansions. There are some holes in history such as the Van Buren/Johnson ticket being impossible. Calhoun died before Clay but that will never happen here.

The game creates a great narrative. Charles C. Pinckney lost twice trying to be president, dueled Burr to no effect, and then founded Texas. Hooray.

I really like this game. The negotiation is interesting, and there's interesting long term positioning to do, and importantly it feels a lot like politics.

UPDATE:  After another full 12-hour game -- and this is the longest game I've ever played to the finish in just one sitting -- I'm updating and rating this a 9, or one level better than the better-known Jason Matthews game (by the way, my favorite game of his thus far).  Each play of this game has created a rich narrative which is why I often want to take copious notes to review and replay for posterity.  All sorts of ahistorical scenarios can happen, and playing a couple of full games of this in the past couple of years has been one of the more rewarding gaming experiences of my life, so that's why the higher rating, placing this game in my all-time top 20 and close to an all-time top 10.

Played a couple of marathon sessions with live opponents but also a few solo sessions as well.  This is a game with a great narrative, but it requires quite a bit of time if playing the complete game scenario.  There are two expansions now available, the most recent one incorporates a couple of "house rules" that our group found made the game more interesting.  Probably best with five, cannot recommend the solitaire scenario.  Looking forward to trying one of the shorter scenarios soon.

This is a fantastic game. It's long - and my group has yet to even get into the 3rd and final stage of the game in our usual 4-hour game window - but it's always in high demand at board game night. Not just a game for history nerds (I'm certainly not one), though I'm sure that enhances the experience. Great diplomatic game with good strategy elements. Highly recommended!

FIRST IMPRESSIONS:

This is not a short game but you can choose to play to a certain point and then stop. I thoroughly enjoyed my first play and look forward to future plays. The history on the cards and the narrative the game tells throughout is quite fascinating as you rewrite early USA history. This is a negotiation game - it is a political game after all but the negotiations really do not extend too long in most cases as you only have to woo the person(s) with enough votes to pass the bill. Delegation can be quite mean as well and change someone who might be opposed into being in favor of a bill in order to avoid the loss in popularity (VPs).

Having never played Republic of Rome, I can't put Founding Fathers into its predecessor's context.  However, I can say that this is quite the complex little title.  The level of detail is insane (which makes the rare glaring historical errors all the more noticeable).  However, like all soft diplomacy games, the player who does the best isn't always going to be the player who [i]plays[/i] the best.  Objectively sound moves can be shot down due to petty grievances.  Historically resonant, sure, but it forces the title clearly into the sphere of social games rather than gamer's games, which is problematic since the complexity and length of the game are not conducive to the typical social game.  The overall feel of the game is strong, as is the semi-coöp/actually-competitive feel of the game.  The history is awesome and fun to meddle with.  But the social aspects of the game just hurt something which should be gamed with more.

Thematically entertaining, but not really my type of game.  I'm not a big fan of negotiating games.  Also had a fair amount of randomness that seemed to have a large impact on the outcome.  

But this is my reaction from only 1 play, so it could change, if I play it more.

Has great mechanics, art, and theme. However, this game can go well beyond the 180 min. suggested play time. Ours went a solid 5+ hours. Negotiations between players come into play with every action taken, (just like real Congress!) Overall, I enjoyed it, but make sure you set aside way more than 3 hours and expect to finish.

Not a euro per se, but more of a thematic journey. 

Be aware it takes a long time to play (broken down into three eras so you can stop along the way). The history is amazingly rich in this design, which looks terrific too.

Still some nebulous mechanics and card interpretations, but it's manageable.

Really glad I purchased this (expensive game, but well worth it)!

Sadly this game will not be played often. I bought it because the box said it is a fast game, but nothing can be further from the truth (at least in my gaming group). We can not finish this in one night (5 hours), so in order to play this we have to plan to play it a whole day, but the few times we do this I would much rather play "The republic of rome".

Looks like an interesting game, but "Republic of Rome" is a much better game.

Great theme and well implemented.  You can really go through recreating the early years of the United States.  If you enjoy American History, you cannot possibly not enjoy at least a few plays of this game.

The "downside" is that the game can be exceptionally long in its full form, so getting people together for it is a challenge.

But it is absolutely an experience game that is easy to appreciate and well designed.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
If you are an American Revolution/Early America fan and you enjoy a long game based primarily on negotiation you probably cannot stop yourself from at least enjoying this game.

The way that the game fits itself into the actual real history is fabulously done, you legitimately get to walk America through its first 80-ish years.  You get to debate all the major issues that faced the young country and possibly take a radically different path than reality.  

Will you outlaw Slavery in 1795?  And if you do can the country avoid financial ruin?  Will you declare actual war on France and will that radically change the future borders of your country?  Can you turn Alexander Hamilton or Henry Clay into the President?  Will Washington fail to survive his first term?  Could Dolly Todd Madison be President?  Will someone run a successful filibuster campaign and form an independent Republic of Texas?  All of this is possible here.

The rules of play are actually quite accessible for a game with such a grand vision.  The components, while not lavish, are above average for a self published game and all expansion material does fit inside of the modestly sized base game box.  The designer is wonderfully prompt and helpful with any questions as well.

The fact that you control a bi-partisan stable of statesman is a little strange to wrap your head around thematically -- but game play wise it is a very interesting twist.  Do you over commit to supporting one party?  What if your best candidate from that party falls into disgrace or dies?  Should you ride the fence and keep your options open?

The only "downsides" I have for this game is that you really need 4-6 people that are willing to commit an entire day in order to get the full experience.  Which even if you have an eager group of good players just cannot feasibly happen more than a few times a year.  But at the same time maybe that will just serve to keep things fresh.

This is a game I will probably never let out of my collection simply due to my fascination with the theme and what the designer has managed to accomplish with integrating it into the game.  The game play itself is probably a 7 in terms of how cunning you can be with the game state you are presented with, but the experience of going through the contents of the game is a 9 (or higher if you like the source material).

If you like American History you owe yourself a play of this.

Two plays through the first deck, one with 3 players and one with 5.  The 5-player game was better.  Those one deck plays took about 2 hours.  I expect the full game to run about 5 hours.  Smooth system.  Evocative and engaging.  Encourages negotiation and deal-making, but within some constraints.

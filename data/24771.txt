Seeing as games are sometimes described as "[other game] on steroids", this is probably best described as "Sticheln on anti-depressants". Still plenty of opportunities for mean play, but less strategic and calculating and much, much faster.

One playing with three. It felt like there was little to no planning possible because you had no idea which cards were in play. We thought it might work better with four or five players or if we took cards out of the mix, such as the three or four highest numbers in each suit when playing with three.

Don't like this one much - a trick taking game where usually you don't want to win, and there's lots of opportunity to dump bad cards on the player to your left. It felt like Nicht die Bohne which I hate. This one has a little more control which lifts its rating a bit, but I still don't like it much and I'm not likely to play it again.

Good trick-taking game.  Not following suit is unusual and it takes a hand or two to get used to it.  It is interesting deciding which three cards to start your scoring piles with, when to risk taking a trick, and how to manage the mid-numbered cards (not worth a lot of points, but can take low-number cards in a trick and tank your score).  Won't ever be a classic, but it is a fun change of pace now and then.

RATING: 8
A very decent wee anti trick-taking game with a nice twist, which can make it a bit difficult to get the hang of.  Entertainingly you get to set up a starting score so you can watch it plummet as the game goes on - sometimes as soon as it starts.  For me, this teeters on the edge of genius - it really is very clever but just a tad too chaotic to be rated higher - it can be very tough when you're stuck winning tricks - yet without the chaos much of the fun would go.  Uprated - I really don't think it's all down to luck and it's enough fun to not really care in any case.

RATING: 5
Play any card you want, since suits don't matter.   Only number matters.   But you are collecting 5 scoring piles, and cards are added (mostly) in order that you collect them.   Thus, the game is more about stitching up other players by forcing them to take high/low cards on top of their piles, while you are avoiding the same.   That wrinkle is fun for a couple of hands while players can be pushed out the game.   Seems like there is an interesting concept here that could be made into a more clever game.

Yes, it's a bit random and there's screwage aplenty. But there's some degree of control (or maybe it's the illusion of control - I can't tell). But the game is still fun for a short, simple filler.

The game has to be played fast though. AP will kill the fun in this game.

Yes, being the middle player sucks but part of the game is baiting the trick hoping that the player to your left tries to win the trick.

Yes, suits don't matter, which means you can't score a card other than the highest card you're dealt. But it's not the end of the world. You can set up your highest cards as the victory point cards and dump or all your low cards on your opponents.

Have I mentioned lately that I like trick-taking games? Null & Nichtig has moved near the top of my list in this genre. It takes a hand or two to gain a sense of how best to play this game, but once everyone gets warmed up, the proverbial fur starts to flutter about. If you like the stick-it-to-the-other-guy gameplay of Sticheln and similar card games, Null & Nichtig is a must-play. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves playing this game amid the maniacal laughter when someone got royally screwed. And the best part of all? I didn't finish with -60  points!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Vacuous game due to players' ability to play any card to any trick.  The highest card wins, without regard for the suit led.  Thus it's impossible to ever score a card higher than the highest card you're dealt.  Think about that a second.  The game plays like Sticheln with all the good parts removed.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An interesting twist on the trick-taking genre... 

Suits are irrelevant for determining trick winner, however players only score the last card they won in each suit.. including 3 cards each set aside at the start of the game. And since you can see what cards people have collected, there is opportunity for a bit of screwage too, which is nice in a whist style cardgame.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Quick & easy "trick taking" game. In wich you don't follow suit.. you're just building 5 different colored piles of cards in front of you.
It plays in around 35 minutes.

If you like easy, simple trick taking games in with healty dose of take that, then this should be something for you.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Easy to understand trick-taking game that, oddly enough, does not feature trumps or even following suit.
Therefore it might be a good first choice for newcomers to the genre.
Nonetheless it still has a decent amount of strategy involved (some of it akin to other games of the genre), and can be played in teams as well.

First played September 24th, 2007.  It's a quick learn (<5min) and a quick play (~25min for 3 players).  It has a good mix of strategy and luck considering it's a trick taking game.  Therare 5 suits colors ranging from numbers 0-11 with two zeros.  You are dealt 10 cards and place three of those face up in front of you.  You gain points (# on the card) for the top card of each color.  The object is to get the most points. (duh)  The person to the left of the dealer starts.  Each player plays a card.  The first highest card wins. (so 1st 11 wins the trick).  Not so fast, it's not always good to take a trick.  Once you win, you take the cards and place those on your stacks of cards (starting with yours) and then with other cards.  So if you start with a blue 11 and then next guy places a blue zero, you will cover your 11 with 0 points.  Ouch!  Yeah, there's some take that in here.  After all cards are played, you add your score together.  You play as many rounds as there are players.  It does grow on you.  It's a good filler game and I'd recommend giving it a try if you know someone who has it.  If you are looking for a new filler trick taking game to play, give it consideration for purchase.

RATING: 5
Very unusual and unintuitive for those already versed in trick-taking games.  For those that enjoy a lot of screwage in games, this can be a joyful romp ruining people's plans.  But it is extremely chaotic, the lack of a trump or need to follow suit means that it's nigh impossible to control what will happen to your stacks.  I still have no idea what the best way is to start your scoring stacks.  The only way to have control seems to be having all low numbered cards, but otherwise every trick is very unpredictable.  I wouldn't want to play this all the time, but every once in a while it's good for some light-hearted laughs.

The first few hands of this game seemed very interesting.  As play progressed, the power of the "nil hand" in which a players three-card laydown consists of their three highest cards seemed disproportionately powerful.  Still a good game but not better than Sticheln.

RATING: 6.8
I don't enjoy trick-taking games in general, but this is one of the more enjoyable trick-taking games to me, along with Stichlen. Tha main reason is that you don't have to follow the lead suit in Null & Nichtig. It is not necessary to keep reminding and being reminded that "one must follow the suit if he/she can." Actually, you often follow the lead suit with a lower number to mess up with other players. In other words, following the lead suit is neatly incorporated in the game-play tactics, rather than strictly prescribed in the rules.

RATING: 4
Have you played Nicht die Bohne? Good news: there are a little more control, but not much. First part of the game is just playing cards and waiting for the last couple of rounds which are more important. I have played so much card games and most of them are more interesting ones than this, so I was more or less bored when I was playing Null & nichtig. So just forget this one, or if you want to try it, just use Sticheln cards (just use some big number cards as a number 0 -cards).

If you don't like trick taking games with those characteristics, you should probably skip this one.

RATING: 6
It reminds me a little bit of Sticheln.  Null & Void is basically a trick taking game with a simplistic set collection mechanism - where you score points based upon the suits you collect.  You only score for the last card collected of each of five suits (if you didn't collect any of one suit, you get nothing).  You don't need to follow suit and winner is the first highest card played.  If you play high cards early, others can throw in a low card in a suit where you have high valued card showing in your collection.  One thing bothers me so far is that if your dealt mostly low to middle values, it's really a tough hand to score any points with unless you consistently nail your opponents high value cards already collected.  Game may be more fun & dynamic if all players start each round with only two chosen cards instead of three...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
LIKES:

* Plays very quickly and makes an excellent filler
* Scoring is unique in that you score the top card of each color you've collected.  Top meaning the last card of each color you collected so if you initially had a blue eleven but later collected a blue 0, your score for blue would be 0!
* Can be a mean little game where you play low on other people's tricks to reduce their score.  

DISLIKES:

* With three people there are a large number of cards not in the game.  I wonder if it would work better to take a suit out with 3 players.  
* I'm not so sure it is a dislike, but it does take a little bit of an adjustment for me to realize that I don't have to follow suit AND that the highest value card wins regardless of suit.

Based on one play: There are so many trick taking games these days and this one can fit into your collection quite well. Although I did not love it I found the scoring to be fairly original. You win tricks and add the cards to you scoring pile however you keep one pile for each color and only the last card won gives you points. Scoring is open and being first to play is dangerous.

This doesn't work for our groups (though it did the first couple of rounds we played). Everyone will go for the same tactic, keep your high cards and try not to win any tricks. This works for everyone but one person (the poor sap who has to start) generally, making the game rather boring.

There's alot of strategies/tactics in here, but a fair amount of chaos as well - however at the end of a full game, the best player will win, it won't come down to luck.

--Sep2014-- It's entertaining:  the patterns of play (both to score as well as possible, and to deny scoring to others) are not obvious.

A unique trick taking game where only the last card in your score pile will be tallied. There are 5 colors with cards numbered from 0 to 11, with the highest card taking the "trick". Cards won from a trick have to be placed on your pile in clock-wise fashion which can have devastating results. A fun card game with limited exposure due to it's availability on in the German language. If you like trick taking games and are looking for something a little different, this is one for you to consider.

RATING: 5.5
[Amigo Spiele 2006 edition] {trick-taking, set-collection} {basic 5, team-play 5.5} N&N is a mediocre trick-taking game for trick-taking fans but it is an ok family game. Players have little control because players are allowed to play any cards without following leading suit. Therefore, it is vulnerable to "let's find a player to screw" symptom. Another weakness is that first largest card wins the trick, which makes the game too easy and strategy too static. As a result, each play is similar and players tend to avoiding leading.  Team-play mode is a little bit more fun but it still isn't great.

This can be a fun family game for occasional plays. However, it falls flat for me, a fan of trick-taking games.

I see no reason to explore this more when Sticheln does the same but so much better.

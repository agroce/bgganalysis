RATING: 5
Not sure how this got children's Spiel des Jahres. The game can at best teach the absolute fundamentals of pattern recognition (red on die => take red piece), motorics (place the piece into the track) and... betting. :D

It Is visually very cute and the board design is unique and intriguing.

I shouldn't enjoy this game as much as I do. I don't love it, it's roll and move basically and the decisions are minimal but when my youngest (3) wants to play a game I'm pleased when she pulls this out. This is one of her most played and favourite games at the minute.

There isn't really much you can do other than throw the dice and place bets, but my 4-year old had a blast - we even played it three consecutive times. The components are fantastic.

A beautifully set in motion diceroll random wormrace game.
The kids like it. They learn the colours and social/turnwise behaviour I guess.
Four years, as age description goes is ok, but the six year gambling option is a hoax to me, that only seems to exist, so that the game can be sold to a broader audience.

RATING: 6
A very basic roll and move game, but one with very nice art and production values.  There are ways of complicating it, however I play almost exclusively with my three year old daughter and so keep it as simple as possible

RATING: 8.5
If your kids like worms and gardens, this game is pretty neat.  It is educational in that you have to estimate where the worm is as you add different length segments to it and it burrows "underground".  It does thus work some with length and concepts like greater than and less than.

Kids game that didn't grab me.  No control when it's not your turn, and little control when it is.

Kids love it. Lovely pieces. Essential to play with modified rules though (put worm sections into other players worms, not your own).

Children Game of the Year 2011 - and the must beat Children Game at the moment. Of course it's only a variant of another Game of the Year "Snail's Pace Race / Tempo Kleine Schnecke" from 1985 till now but the best variant up-to-date. Graphic is excellent, the idea with three hidden chapter till the end is exciting for kids of all age. This is the favourite of my four year old boy (before Looping Louie or Diego Drachenzahn) and my seven year old daughter is joining most times. 
If you're looking for a "Family/Kids" Game for children beetween 4 and 10, give'em a try.

Surprisingly popular with the kids. I think the pure randomness of it allows them pleasure of an equal chance of victory over older kids/adults.  Also, my 4 year old nephew now has an excellent idea of measurements from 1cm-6cm  thanks to this game.

RATING: 4
It's a game of contradictions. An infinetely stupid and random mechanic married with a great theme and beatiful pieces. There are two modes of playing and both are random to the extent that on the way you start wondering whether you are playing this thing correctly. And believe me - you are.

So kids (small ones) will have a blast. Everyone else - rather not.

Granted, my daughter (5) likes this (the basic version of it). I am less impressed; it isn't bad for younger children, but somewhat uninspired in my opinion.

RATING: 7
Rated in comparison to other children's games. Quick and fun dice rolling game with a little bit of betting. The production really sells this one, and the board is full of great details for kids to get interested in. They also love lifting the top part off the board when the game is over to see their different coloured worms.

Il gioco dell'oca per i più piccoli, dove è stato tolto anche il dado con i numeri, sostituito da uno con i colori. Variante non sufficiente a giustificarne l'acquisto, se si possiede già il primo.

This was a fairly awesome game for kids.  Our son LOVED it when little and still wanted to keep it even when he was really too old for it.  We convinced him to trade it away so some other kid could enjoy it.  VERY IMPORTANT -- the adults didn't get totally bored playing this game, which was delightful.

Children's game rating. Roll and move with a very small but fun twists (a hint of memory, a little guesswork) that make it a game for 4-year-olds instead of 3. Also, the graphic design makes it rather adorable and fun.

For little children this is a good game, but Kinderspiel des Jahres? I'm not sure. There are some decisions (some betting on results), but the actual race is 100% luck. It is a quick game, however, and the secret board makes it more exciting than most roll-and-move race games. Still, kids love it and my three-year-old can play the game, so that's always good.

Nothing for adults, but fortunately the game is simple enough for children to play it alone without adult guidance.

Indifferent.

Et spill mine to døtre på 2 og 4 år elsker å spille. Moro å se ormen dukke opp i de små glippene underveis, i tillegg til at den eldste synes det er gøy å satse på hvem som kommer først til jordbær/blomst for å få ekstra brikke. Et flott og godt spill. Anbefales.

Juego ideal para jugar con los más pequeños, recomendable desde los 2 años (o apenas los niños identifiquen los colores). Es un juego basado completamente en la suerte, pero artísticamente muy bien logrado y perfectamente simple para introducir a niños muy pequeños en los juegos de mesa.

Ideal to play with the little ones, from 2 years up (or as soon as they identify colors). Is a game based completely on luck, but with fantastic art work and simple enough to get little children into board games.

Very nice game for small children. 
The material is very cute and children love to put their pieces to make their worm go ahead on the board.
However it is really a easy game as it's based mostly on luck, almost no strategy at all involved here!

RATING: 5.75
A good trick taking game.  You really have to play your "No Soup Today" menu card at the right time.  A smart little game in the vein of Mamma Mia!  Mamma Mia is the better of the two though, but this is still a fun little filler.

RATING: 6
It looks like a kids game but really isn't. I ended up totally hosed during the round where every card I won counted against me (-23!) but still had fun. I don't play many trick taking games but would be happy to play Too Many Cooks again.

RATING: 6
One of Knizia's takes on trick taking. There's always a twist (or several) with him. Being a former bridge player I do find this enjoyable, but very very light. Not my favorite trick taking game, but a fun filler that's easy to introduce to new players.

A very fun trick-taking/hand management card game.  OMGXOBXHUGE box for what it contains, though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A different spin on trick-taking and avoiding.  Some interesting decisions.  The decreasing number of bidding options as the game goes on suggests an increasing level of randomness.  However, the challenge for all players is to make the best of less than ideal hand/bid matches - and not to take the huge risk of leaving that take no cards bid until last. I have the University Games version "Veel Soeps!".  Card quality is really poor.

Very simple building/trick taking game. Each player gets five goals and has to play one of these in each of the five rounds of the game. Depending on the goals different cards gain or lose you points. Too simple for my taste. Might be a good way too introduce children to these kinds of cardgames.

The theme doesn't exactly make sense, but the gameplay is alright.  There is definitely some strategy involved, but it's easy enough for the whole family.  It has a really nasty edge as you can easily take points away from your opponents.

[MRU]

If the cards were designed a bit better, this would probably go up to a 7...as it is, I always have new players get confused over some of the cards - so much so that I've actually labelled the cards now.

Plays pretty quickly (good lunch hour game) and the luck of the soup draw can have some pretty big implications, but people usually seem to enjoy playing nonetheless.

One of my favorite fillers (though I'm not much of a filler person).

RATING: 4
Not a bad game.  I like the concept but feel like the seating order in a 5 player game and the luck of the drawer (e.g., I played mushrooms early when i had a decent hand but now have a great hand) are a little higher than I like.  I enjoyed the 2-player more than the 5.  May want to try it with 3 to see the ideal player count.

Not a lot of fun-factor, and not a lot of control over what happens.  Maybe it will grow on me as I learn some strategies.

RATING: 7.5
Unique trick taking game that allows tricks to be taken based on card value and not on set number of cards.  The soup each player makes each round also creates some difficult decisions.  Works well from 2-5 players.

Fun and competitive. Great mechanics.. but the scoring system feels like an afterthought that was stapled onto the game. Not as good for 2, but great for 3-4. Have yet to try with 5 players. A good pair to Bohnanza for similar theme and artwork, although Too Many Cooks has a better "screw your neighbor" factor. Unfortunately it does tend to have a heavy "screw the player to your left" feel to it. I really appreciate how the strategies for making no soup or for chili feel completely different from those for making soup.

Hearts-style trick-taking game.  At least it's quick ..

RATING: 7
This is a funny little trick-taking game with funny little cards.  (The mushrooms carrying butter on their backs is hilarious--and with respect to cream of mushroom soup, strangely accurate...)  It's not bad for a relatively simple, shorter trick-taking game (i.e. there aren't as many rules and nuances as Mu, Was Sticht, etc.), but I got the most amusement out of the card illustrations.

One of the times I played it was with 2 players, and the other player made up the rule that soup recipes be kept secret until the end of a round.  This made the game a little more interesting, especially at the beginning, since otherwise there's not much to a 2-player trick-taking game.

This is a very interesting and fun game, which is much trickier than it sounds from reading the rules.  The only problem is that two of the suits are green, making a couple of the cards hard to tell apart.  We have played with 2 or 3 players, and had a blast every time.

RATING: 6
We didn't play a complete game of this because a game of Traders of Genoa was waiting. But after two rounds, I felt there was still enough to explore in the hand management to want to play again. Each round, players have different goals as selected from their initial hand of goal cards. You play the one that fits your hand that round. My guess is that there is a reasonable amount of play in this little trick-taker.

Initial thoughts... I enjoy the funny artwork, and like the 3 v. 1 asymmetrical suits. I also like the mechanic of the menu cards, but maybe 5 of them leads to a too long game.  So far I think that  "Where's Bob's Hat" handles it better.

I was doing well with 20 points till the final round, then in the final round I had to play "no soup today" and unfortunately so did another player (4 players).  Anyway to cut a long story short I ended up losing 18 points from having to pick up cards in that round, ended up with 2 points!!!  In an almost deterministic fashion.

Am I pissed cause I lost or is this game a bit unbalanced!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Played with 2 and 5. As with many games, more players = less control. This is light enough that it doesn't really matter, but 4 is probably the sweet spot if you want to feel like you have some control.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
The game, while having an appealing subject with some cute twists, is rather boring when actually played. There is no way to plan your moves, and luck plays a major factor. This wouldn't be bad in itself were it not for the fact that the game just won't speed up. People slip into analysis mode without noticing, and then the game quickly begins to drag. In addition, the quality of the cards is apalling. An ordinary deck of cards worth €1 is printed on better stock! Really very, very disappointing, hence the low rating. How this ever got a higher ranking than Keythedral during the election of the Nederlandse Spellenprijs 2005 is a complete mystery.

Enjoyable theme and fun to play but I've got a few reservations.  You're forced to bid/score the last hand blind.  Get a bad hand there and you can't play through a bad deal.  I'm also concerned that tricks can end up being taken by seating order rather than by skillful card play.

Light, but fun, trick-taking card game.  The only thing I disliked was that once you chose a set for a round, you couldn't choose that set in later rounds of the game.  Actually, that restriction is probably what makes it a good game.  It's just that if you get a really bad card draw, it can ruin your chances of winning.

A trick-taking game with a gimmick that works fairly well. The values of the cards played into a trick determine when it ends, so some players will have played more cards into the trick than other players, and tricks can range from two cards to more than a dozen.

Players are dealt a hand of 13 cards, featuring Pea, Mushroom, Onion or Chilli.  Players have to make five bowls of soup, featuring each of these ingredients once, plus the &quot;no soup today&quot; goal.  Points are awarded for getting the right ingredients into your soup (ie. taking those cards in tricks) and are deducted for including other ingredients (ie. chilli in almost everything!).  Easy to play, and a lot of fun.  It works.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

A bit like Sticheln, but much lighter (and quicker).  The last hand can be a bit too random because you only have one choice of bid.  But it's a good alternative when you want a relatively mindless trick-taking-ish game.

* Played 5+ times. I don't like ANY Knizia card games. Except this one. Fun, light, trick-taking game with fun graphics. Instead of trying to win a trick by highest number, the trick is won when the sum hits 10 points. Players have Boil-Over cards that reset the sum to zero, and choosing the timing, or choosing to take a worthless trick to deny someone else makes for fun.

This is a fun, quick card game that plays well with 2.  There's a goodly amount of strategy, and it's like a light bridge.  You lose a lot of control with 4 players, but the more players you have, the more chaotic and fun the game gets.

At one time, I would have rated this game very, very highly - in my top 10 for sure - but it has dropped somewhat.  I can't really think of why, other than the fact that I have more games now and because I enjoy card games such as Cribbage and Hearts much more.

Enjoyable with 3-4, but fairly chaotic.  It is a game of trick avoidance where planning ahead is hard and it can be somewhat nasty.  I think 5 is too many.  2 player is not bad, but so many cards are unused that there is more luck, but position matters far less and there is no conspiring.

RATING: 7
A very solid filler game.  A bit longer than some fillers due to the multiple rounds of play.  It's a hearts-like game: collect the good cards and avoid the bad ones.  You play cards until 10 points are showing (with cards 0-5 and 10, plus "reset to 0"), so tricks can get very large and opportunities for screwage are delightfully high.  Add that to the fact that in later hands you're often stuck with an unfavorable suit bid and fortunes can swing wildly.  As with any trick game, if you watch your opponent's play carefully you'll usually get what you want, and occasionally go down in flames.

Nice because it has a very different feel from the very strategic, positional games we tend to play otherwise.  Also, it's very easy to teach and play.

A lot of luck lies in your deck working with you with the menu choice you make but, there's a lot working here to allow you to make decisions that matter.  I want to try this one out again for sure!

The artwork on the cards isn't too bad, and I think the theme is enjoyable because it's a little different than most other games out there.  That said, the production quality isn't too great and the box is way too big.

Competition is fierce among trick taking games.  This one took a little longer than I'd like and seemed to lack the amount of control I would prefer.  There are probably better options out there.

It may just be that I am a sucker for food-themed games, but I find this a fun trick-taking, or more accurately climbing, variant.

I also had Knizia's Poison, which has a great deal in common with this one, but somehow I find that one completely uninteresting. Perhaps someone could explain why.

Potential for a good family trick-taking game. I like the recipe card positive/negative points consideration, along with taking the pot once it reaches or exceeds 10 points.  Enjoyed my second play more once some rules were clarified and corrected after a confusing first game on a different night. Cute cartoon artwork for the soup ingredients will appeal to kids… and kids at heart. (I heard that the 2009 reprint has flimsy cards, but the 2002 edition that I own has good card quality.)

Played with three, four and five players. It is some fun to play, but I liked it best with three, when you have more control. The more players, the more you are dependent upon a good (preferably very one-sided) hand. Also with so much randomness and little control, the games takes too long. A cardgame with no more than filler-depth should't last longer than 20-30 minutes. This one takes an hour.

I'm glad to see that trick-taking games are starting to come with themes and this one has a good theme.  Players are trying to take tricks which will allow them to fulfill their recipes.  Other players are trying to spoil your recipes with chili peppers.  The problem with this game is that there is very little control.  Players manage cards containing different ingredients (suits) numbered 1-5.  Once the trick reaches a total of 10 it's taken.  Tricks can be taken quickly but I found that once it came to my turn I could take the trick if I happened to have the right card or I could "try" to effect what was left in the soup for the next player.

While it's more colorful and adds a slight layer of planning, Too Many Cooks is basically synonymous with Hearts. If anything, it's even more luck-driven, as poor deals in the late rounds can just kill you. Since Hearts is a nostalgic favorite that I'm pretty good at, I'll give this another whirl if it pops up again, but I won't miss it if it doesn't.

Really neat, cutthroat trick-taking game. The idea behind Too Many Cooks is so simple, yet so effective. It feels like an offshoot of one of those trick-taking games where you guess the amount of tricks you'll take, but instead of coming up with a number, you're trying to claim cards of particular suits. It's a really neat idea, though it does feel a little hard to control at times. Plus the fact that whoever makes a trick go to 10 or above has to claim it means you can really screw over your neighbor at the most opportune times. Definitely a keeper for me, and quite underrated as well.

After one play, the jury remains out on this. I really like a lot of the ideas. I'm not sure if the game will be too luck based and/or dependant on the players knowing the game and strategies. If you don't pay attention you can set up the next player for a lot of easy points. You also need to be aware that if you are going to play your "No Soup" card (the one where you score points for taking no cards) it needs to done when you have a hand with lots of options and low cards. We had a player hold this card until the last hand and he wound up with about 18 negative points because every time the trick came to him he had to follow suit and take the cards. I think I will hang on to this and try and cultivate a few experienced players to see if there is as much game here as I think there might be.

A minor variant on a broad family of cardgames, but it is noticeable that those with a good whist or cribbage background will still excel. 'Proper' trick-taking strategies such as passive leads and short-suiting very much apply, which is pretty clever in itself when you're twisting the mechanics. A very enjoyable end-of-evening game.

I like trick taking games but this falls down in two ways - too little control in the latter rounds over what to shoot for (meaning point scoring becomes more arbitrary), and too much control rests with the other players as to whether you'll win the round-and-round tricks or not (ie too much intra-trick targetting). Making point scoring even more random. The final round for example you're forced to play for tricks in a given colour regardless of the hand you get. A lottery. Each time I play this game, I think surely it's not as bad as I remember, and it starts out ok for the first hand, and then degenerates badly as the issues above kick in, just as always before.

Trick taking cardgame with multiple novel twists, but may suffer too often from the tactical denial of other player's desired cards and scores can swing wildly, (having none of the hopeful charm of Canyon). 

I like trick bidding games, but here it is too punishing, especially towards game end where luck of deal appears dominant.  Shame as I find the game play more humourous because of the advertised intentions of the soup cards: not only do you want to (or not) collect certain colours but also avoid as well, sometimes with the 'pot' getting bigger, increasing the desire to take or need to avoid, with fun escape by playing the 'boil over' card, making the pot even bigger. 

Distribution of values is difficult to commit to memory. May play only 4 instead of 5 rounds to diminish the luck of the last deal and reduce the pain of those who know they have no chance of catching up; also may play where your bid is revealed in turn order. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
The game appears flawed especially for a trick yaking game.  In the final round you have no control over the suit you must play for with no relation to the cards in hand. Note: The trick taking mechanism is based on total points not on high card value.

I was really surprised by this game!  I got it as a toss-in on a trade, but it's turned out to be a lot of fun.  Oddly, it's a trick-taking game that works for two!  I've played it with two and three, and it's been great.  It's an interesting combination of feel: it's got reasonable depth, and requires some skill to win consistently, but it's got a luck element that makes it not too frustrating for newbies, and it has a clearly visible reward/punishment system, so that even when losing, a player can have fun sticking it to someone else with a nasty chili pepper.

Starts out well, but as "soups" are used, the later rounds become more luck dominated.  Games can be decided by who has the lucky hand in the last round that seems to match their one unplayed card.  No means of control/strategy to overcome the luck factor.  Like the concept, but there are better trick-taking games with a twist out there - Sticheln, Flaschenteufel - to name a couple.

This is a fun little trick taking game that kind of reminds me of Hearts.

Like it more than Poison, because the card distribution is much more intuitive (instead of "how many 4s again??"), and the 1 pot makes it interesting. Don't like how chiles/trumps allow any suit to be played, seems to tear apart all the necessary constraints you need for trick-taking games.

The 5-menu (objectives) thing is a complete gimmick. Other trick-taking games like Sticheln don't constrain your trump suit or favored suit like that. Games become more and more luck-swingy with subsequent rounds with the possibility that you draw a strong Pea hand, but you've already completed your Pea menu earlier. The last round is a complete crapshoot, not a good reward if you've carefully built your lead through the first 4 rounds.

I really wanted to like this game.  I really like the concept of the contracts. It has a fun theme and the art is nice, but I feel that many of your choices are made for you by having to follow suit.  As it has a poison quality of Coloretto, there is some fun in trying to counter too many points going to the right player.  Sadly, if you have to follow a lead your hand often is inadvertantly bled to help a player on your left.  As the margin is so small to take the trick, it feels like your small options (already constrained from the minute hand) become thinner.

It just didn't live up to the fun that it should have yielded for me.  It would be tough to get me to play this again.

The cards are cute, and I am very much in favor of bouillon cubes in general, but the gameplay here was not wonderful.
It's hard to rack up much score on any of the soup hands, so the no-soup hand becomes disproportionately influential, as you can incur a sky-high penalty from which you cannot recover.

It's a light trick-taking game. It ought to play pretty quickly, although ours took us 48.8 minutes -- maybe I wasn't the only one that was tired!  I had originally rated this a 6, but it's probably better than that. If it played more quickly it would definitely be a 7 -- there doesn't seem to be a lot of control since you MUST follow suit, and I'd prefer a game with that much randomness to play more quickly. For now, a 6.5 for me.

[b]Rules[/b]
Each player gets the same set of 5 menu items ("No Soup", and a card each for french-onion, split pea, mushroom and chili soups), and a 5VP chit. You deal out all the cards, which come in each of the first 4 "suits" and butter, and are numbered 0-5 (2 each), 10, and 0/boil over. There are also 10 chili cards (1-5 x 2). Then, players simultaneously choose and reveal one of their menu cards: these determine the types of ingredients (the suits) that score them points this hand: 1 point per card taken of the matching suit, and one pain suit worth -1pt/card. If you choose the "No Soup" order, you immediately get 5VP but ALL cards won in tricks are -1VP. For a chili order, 0's (plain 0, called "boullion", not 0/boil over cards) are -1VP. For the other 3 orders, chilis are -1 VP.

The player to the left of the dealer leads the first card, then the winner of a trick leads next. Players must follow suit if possible; if not, they may play any suit. However, if a chili has been added to the soup, you may play any suit. When you play a card, announce the sum of all cards played thus far. The 0/Boil Over card resets the total to 0 (leave the cards in the pile). The last exception is that if you play a 10 when the total is currently 0, the total remains 0. If your play takes makes the sum 10 or higher, you win the trick: add the cards to your pile and lead the next trick. The hand ends when it's your turn to play a card and you cannot: everyone discards all cards remaining in hand. After scoring VP for the trick (negative points are possible), the deal passes to the left. Play 5 hands, with a new menu item/player/hand. Most VP at end wins!

Nice little adding game.  One of my gaming group really likes it, so it gets more play than I would give it.

I normally enjoy trick-taking games more. However, I agree with the criticism that the game-end is unsatisfying because you only have two menus, then only one before the game ends, and you really need the right cards. I do like the artwork here.  It's goofy in a Bohnanza type way.  I remember buying this in a Vegas game store and wanting to play it badly.  Still fun, just a little too random at the end to rank amongst the really good games in this genre.

This game completely baffled me on my first play -- and I loved it!  Almost everything I tried backfired.  The combination of crosspurposes with the different goals for each player and the having to get all five of your different goals in with just exactly five hands provides fine boundaries for the challenge of playing your cards effectively.  A terrific card game!

[R&R 2002 edition] {Food; trick-taking, blind-bidding, utility card; optimal 4p} Too Many Cooks is an interesting trick-taking game. It's a nice family game - around 30 minutes play-time, fun, interactive and with some meaningful decisions. It has a theme, too!

It's quite similar to Poison, another Knizia game, but it's more dynamic due to the menu cards and boil-over cards; nonetheless, it's less tactical.

The illustration is cute enough. The box is larger than necessary. It'd be better if the tokens are made larger.

Once you get the rules nailed there's a reasonable set collection game inside. But a much better game of a similar ilk would be Mama Mia.

Play cards following suit until someone takes the total over 10 and wins the hand. Maybe they're happy but more often they seem sad since each player must declare their objective before each round. When you have little choice of objective in the last couple of rounds things can turn particularly painful. Good fun.

This is not a bad filler game.  There is a lot of luck involved when picking a soup.  If your upstream opponent happens to match you, that is bad.  Also, in the final round, you don't have a choice as to which soup you will make.  Your hand of cards may or may not match that.  However, it's still pretty fun, and it has a short enough playing time that bad luck can be forgiven easily.

Feels like a classic card game that you've never heard of before. I particularly like picking the different menus based on your hand, until eventually you are stuck with whatever you get. The last hand is always fun, though pure luck can turn the game around 180 degrees at that point... you can't take it too seriously for this reason.

My favorite trick taking game... and that's no bullion.

Strictly speaking,  I am not quite sure if this is actually a trick taking game in it's purest form.  Some say it's an adding game.  I have no interest in correctly categorizing it....I am just here to sing it's praises.

By all outward appearances this one has the look of a mailed in design a la Gold Digger,  or one of the many other insignificant Knizia releases.  Take your pick.  But,  as they say,  looks can be deceiving.  

To say I was pleasantly surprised with this game is a profound understatement.  Somehow,  Knizia takes the simple and often mundane mechanics featured in the game Poison,  adds a few rules and twists and miraculously transforms,  what was an average game at best,  into this clever and entertaining gem.  In this imaginary cauldron,  those rule additions add a lot of spice,  which serves to enhance this simple card game better than anyone had a right to expect.  What you are left with is something that truly transcends the sum of it's parts,  all in a light weight package.

There is some criticism about the restrictive nature of the contracts,  especially as the game progresses.  But,  to me,   it is in this area where the game truly shines.  Having to apply damage control in a hand where you're not really suited ( pun intended ) to excel,  is often a tense laden bliss.  Succeeding - even to a small degree -  when you find yourself mano a mano with an opponent who chose a similar contract,  is also,   equally as rewarding. 

With 3 or 4 players this game approaches the 10 territory.  It is not a deep experience by any means,  but I doubt many can rival it while standing on equal ground.

Edit:  It appears this title predates the game Poison by three years -  although I was introduced to them in reverse order.  Poison,  as it turns out is a watered down version of this game - despite which it is also  the far more popular of the two.  It makes little difference to me as I sold that one long ago,  however,  I happen to find that fact quite inexplicable.

Great idea, less-than-perfect execution. Somewhat of a combination of Hearts and Spades, where each player gets to pick the "suit" that will earn him points. But, it's sloppy. The game needed more playtesting, and more fine-tuning. Feels like it was just thrown together, which is a waste because the core mechanic/idea of the game is so cool. The slapped-on theme was cute, but the art and art design is poor and take away from the game. A definite letdown.

Excellent trick-taking game. Playing each trick to a sum value of cards is a novel variation on the usual trick-taking mechanism, and changes the dynamics of play a lot.

I can understand why some dislike the lack of choice in suits in the final hand, but it doesn't particularly bother me. It even adds a bit of chaos to keep it anybody's game up until the end. Of course, that does firmly establish this as a light game, and it would be interesting to try the rather obvious variant where that final hand isn't included.

A quick trick taking game.  Interesting and fun, but you don't really need to buy this if you know how to play spades, hearts, or ups and downs.  May be a good way to introduce trick taking.  I guess it isn't strictly trick taking, since people can play more than one card per trick, but it feels like you're playing hearts or something basically.

A very fun trick taking game. A quick reversal of fortune can lead to a win or a loss. A decent bit of luck is involved. It plays fast like a good opener should. As your options for what soup to make dwindle, it can be suspenseful in a simple and satisfying way.

A fun little card game similar to Poison but not as mindless. The game plays over 5 hands. You have to make 5 different soups, one each round. The choice depends on your hand. You got a lot of peas? Make pea soup this time. Hopefully next hand you don't get a lot of peas again because now you only have the option of onion, mushroom, chili or NO SOUP FOR YOU! When making onion, mushroom or pea soup any of those 3 ingredients are safe to take but you only score a point per card of the soup you choose. Chili in your soup counts against you (kind of like poison). When making chili the boullion cards count against you. When making NO SOUP FOR YOU! all the cards count against you. I liked it, probably more than most will because i love to say "NO SOUP FOR YOU!"

Decent climbing games with a built-in "reset" button for a given trick, but it's easy to get hosed with taking cards you don't need because you have to play all 5 menu cards.  I would much prefer if you weren't forced to use all menu cards in a game, or had more menu cards than you had rounds in the game, allowing players to pick, say, 5 out of 7 menu cards.  I think it would give the game the right amount of control to appeal to me.

It should not be socially acceptable to create a game that children can only enjoy after they get high with their parents.

This is a game of avoiding taking cards most of the time but taking them one round. That is a nice twist. That you get to look at your hand and then decide which soup to make that round is also a good idea. Card players should like this one for the variety. Good for playing a few times a year.

The numerical limit to when the pot of cards is taken reminds me of Poison, but there is more strategy involved in this.  I like how the value of cards are different depending on the recipe you are doing.  Makes for interesting play when there are several different ones on the table (but less so otherwise, especially if you happen to pick the same soup as the person on your right).  It's a neat little game with a surprising amount of depth.  Could conceivably be rotated with other fillers such as Die Sieben Siegel and Poison.

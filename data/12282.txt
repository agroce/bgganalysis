Interesting Ted Racier design on the 'opening moves' of the WWI. Combat system drags the game a bit for me (the grindish A&A battleboard), but isn't that what WWI should feel like? (and not the sweeping fun that is Paths of Glory).

I like the large hexes and games of this kind. Simplification without losing on history should be possible.

The clumsy rulebook makes gameplay a rather steep learning curve. However the exceptions add flavour to the game and doesn't bother me at all.

This game could have been the perfect game on this topic. Unfortunately it isn't and I am left with a feeling of opportunities lost.

Neat game system, excellent components, but overall impact is tempered by the historically accurate but somewhat In Your Face movement/supply restrictions that affect the first half of the game.  Yeah, they're necessary, but they are much more in the foreground and seem more onerous in this rendition than say the earlier take of 1914 Glory's End. 

One other note -- I wonder why there wasn't/isn't a rule awarding the Germans say 1 VP if they get any units INTO Paris.  Taking that city for an Auto Victory is valid, and also a very long shot.  But given French mistakes and the fortunes of war, the Ger can have a shot at moving an army/corps into the city, even if it is guaranteed to draw the wrath of several Allied stacks in the vicinity, and eventually be driven out, or cut off from supply.  That said, wouldn't 10-50000 Germans entering Paris, or battling in its suburbs, induce enough panic/shock to warrant 1 VP?

Seems a fitting reward for the Germans and incentive to take a stab at the city.

This game deserves to be the start of a whole series.

Very nice level of interplay to cover the opening guns
of WWI in the West. Pulsed system, with significant choices -
but usually not ones which leave me agonizing. Pretty much
a perfect fit for a gamer's game on the subject matter - 
and the historical aspects, given the scale seem fairly
accurate. One thing that I really like is the Fortunes of
War table, which generates random conditions for (or preventing)
a battle. Throws a serious monkey wrench into what otherwise
would be painfully calculable (ala No Retreat).
Add to that the combat itself (to hit per unit - lined
up against one another) and combat is always a risk.
I usually don't like those line up and shoot systems,
but keeping it to one roll per unit per battle makes 
this work well.

GMT rules are always an issue, and there are a few problems
with them on top of organization. Lots of special cases though, and they are necessary
to providing the historical experience; each one is a 
potential trap which is easily forgotten and hard to
find.

Found this surprisingly good actually, given PoG.

Someday I'll solitaire my way through this. I like the required attacks to force you to act in a historical manner. That itself is historical as the army commanders were under intense pressure to fully commit to the disastrous pre-war plans - they simply HAD to make attacks they knew had little to no chance of success. There are a few straitjacket rules here and there, but overall it looks like a very playable system and I LOVE the large hexes!

May trend up to an 8 if the second play goes well. Potentially decent game that is severely held back by an awful rulbook and lousy player aids. Otherwise, I like the back-and-forth of the impulses, which keeps the game moving, and the campaign generates tensions inherently.

RATING: 6
The oversized hexes and low counter density give it a nice feel where you can see and plan.

I don't feel I've got the hang of using the battleboard combat to produce any advantage and in my games so far my Germans have been toothless on the attack.

Still, an engaging game which I'll wheel out again for a spin sometime.

Provisional assessment based on solo play only: a mechanically simple game, once you comprehend the rules (which are poorly written in parts), in which most of the tension comes from deciding where to use your limited activations. Some oddities in the rules, since reinforcements may sit around without moving because it's inefficient to spend an activation just to move up a single corps. Overall a fairly good game to which I'd be willing to give a ftf slot.

One of the few games I've poured back into the box and thrown on the shelf never expecting to play again.

The rules manage to railroad game play while at the same time being a total train wreck.  While the CAPs approach makes the game worth trying ... the game ultimately fails to provide a framework within which gamers can explore possibilities.  You repeat history - after spending hours reading the terrible rules.

The graphic presentation is very nice, but there are missteps here as well.  Markers for tracking the British and French losses towards German VPs ... necessary in each scenario shouldn't be asking too much.  Did we really need two dozen "Hexside blocked" markers?

And as for the Hex entry/exit rules.... they are one of several aspects of the game that are very similar to what one sees in Area/Impulse titles but here the execution is very clumsy.  It's as though someone developed an A/I game without realizing there was excellent prior art out there, and the result does not compare favorably.

Bottom line, CAPs are little more than impulses implemented poorly.

Purchased the game for less than 20 bucks unpunched and happily traded it away.

This is a great game. You open the box and everything about it begs to be played. Great period feel. It's got the right elements to reflect the strategic situation it portrays, but it doesn't bog down in minutiae. The battle board probably throws too much luck into tactical outcomes, but it's an excellent game player's touch. The rules are not well organized and do straitjacket you into following the historical script; I don't play these games to recreate step-by-step the exact moves or mistakes of the original participants; I play them to see "what if". So, if you have the supplies and the units available, why not make a run for the coast and a broad flanking maneuver? Cut a couple of rules and you put a lot more "what if" in the game without sacrificing any historicity. However, I played this game several times in a single week and it's one I'll keep coming back to in the future. Raicer found that fine balance between "game" and "simulation". Excellent.

Wonderful game that captures the command dilemmas of both sides in the 1914 campaign. A challenging game that will test both players. I don't get a sense that the game railroads players too much. There's still room for creativity and exploitation, especially from Turn 3 for the Germans. I just wish the rulebook was better organised or had an index.

Based on Solitaire play:
Ted Racier has designed another really good game.  The rules and mechanics are innovative, which is refreshing for a hex-counter game.  I didn't find the rules poor as a number of other posts suggest.  My only crit is that it represents a limited period of the war in the West.

A more clunky, ugly game (mechanics wise) is hard to find.It seems to crudely shoehorn you into historical events to cover up the under developed game.

Good game filled with tough decisions for each side. Captures the excitement of the opening months of World War I in Western Europe, a period when the world held its breath. There are enough special rules to create the flavor and realities of the campaign without impeding play. 

I gave this game to my brother after Worthington released their take on the same situation. It just seems this game was not going to see much play.

based on some solitaire and brief 2-player.  excellent appearance, living rules are fairly clear.  I think this is a very good solitaire game, since your strategic options are fairly limited, so it is mainly an issue of making the best tactical move and managing resources and CAPS, which are open information.  This solitaire strength, however, detracts from generating a lot of interest for two players.  There are a lot of rules for special situations that require putting in some real time to make sure you are playing correctly, and to understand what is and is not a bad move.

Likely a decent simulation (I am not a WWI expert), but not much in the game aspect.

Update:  After more play, I think there are just too many chrome rules that 'put the game on rails' to make it interesting to a non-WWI buff.  To name a few:

- Belgians must retreat if attacked.
- Belgians can't attack if two German units 'watch them'
- Germans can't block the Belgian retreat.
- Germans can't enter coastal hexes for a period of time.
- Mauberge is the key to the logistics net, but Germany can't attack it turn 1, and the Allies can't defend it on turn 1.
- Mandated attacks.
- Special one-time general withdrawal rules.
- German supply net stops in a certain hex for a certain period of time.

Basically, you have to do the moves the actual leaders did, and the fog-of-war randomness, the CAP limits, and the combat die-rolls determines what happens.

I prefer a game that the game mechanics push you towards historical paths, not chrome rules that make you do historical paths.

It may be that the game keeps the player from doing just what they like, but that is exactly correct.  The Germans reduced the original Schlieffen plan right wing from a 7:1 to 3:1 advantage so there would never be enough troops to go wandering off to the coast.  In fact the German right swing had to be reduced so that it would not have swung around Paris. Having said that the German army couldnt supply the smaller right flank.  So the game restrictions forcing players to act historically are not just there as an obstruction but to prevent fantasy tactics that could not have benn employed. A terrific game and the larger hex system is far better.  Nicely produced and the best WW1 game yet.

Playing it brings to life the drama of the opening phase of the Great War (i.e just like in the book The Guns of August)  The large hexes, and limited command point system forces players to think like Generals and manuever their Armies, rather than look for the perfect hex location. The battles are desperate and tense. I had a little bit of trouble at first with the rules, this was mostly due to the unusual nature of the design. GMT's excellant support on CSW was above and beyond in helping me understand the game.

Just in, a very interesting game that explores the opening stages of the Von Sleffin Plan. The mandated attacks and historical setup pretty forces the player to repeat history so opportunities to deviate are few. An interesting study nevertheless

i just finished playing the opening moves of Great War in Europe Deluxe, so I thought I would come back to this game that I had tried to learn two years ago. Time did not help. I am not sure why, but the rules are impossible. I think because there is no real structure to the rules, but rather a mass of chrome and cases and exceptions to make the Western Front flow the way it did in 1914. I have a number of other posts, and I think if I could ever find someone who has played this and could walk me through it the rating would go higher. However, after a second (or third?) attempt, I find this game impossible to play, and thus it goes back into the back of the closet for another year.

RATING: 8
Good, tense game, requiring many tough decisions in spite of there being some obvious strategic restrictions.    The 6-6-05 ruleset is unambiguous and the Marne learning scenario (with P500 orders) served as an excellent intro.

With experienced players, I can see hidden CAPs levels becoming a nerve-wracking house rule (check with your cardiac physician beforehand).  Once the Allies are no longer as concerned about losses is the only gamey aspect I see, and it's a minor thing.

Nice take on WWI... somewhat long rule book, good game.

Another WW1 game by Ted with a nice map (with big hexes!). The rule book is big and diffuse requiring multiple passes to find all the bits of info you need. If you are a control freak you will not like this game as it has lots of scripted requirements per turn but that said it is a fascinating gut wrenching experience. Overall I would recommend getting Ted's Paths of Glory over Grand Illusion if you were to get just one game. If you want a focused WWI Western front game of the opening period of the war AND don't mind having a game that leans more to being a scripted simulation vs. a truly open-ended what-if then this is your game.

Update (June 4, 2014): Still like the map, still a nice opening WW1 on the western front ala Schlieffen Plan.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Along with The First World War and other games from Ted Raicer, this game commemorates the 90th anniversary of the starting of the war. This is a very good game on the opening WW1 on the western front, whereas Schlieffen Plan was laid out with great confidence by the Germans. The rulebook is a bit wordy and convoluted sometimes though.  The rulebook would give you a fairly complex game with a lot special rules e.g. the mandated attacks and the wheel of fortune.  However, the execution is rather easy.  A special feature is the combat resolution takes place in a battle board, where both sides deploy the troops along a 4 boxes front.  The excess units (those exceeds 4) in a combat hex can be deployed in the reserve, the second line, for getting an extra shot and hits on the enemies opposite (note the quirky "maximum 4" in the living rule though).  Quite an unusal but interesting simulation of the WW1 warfare.  It is quite a clever mechanism to resolve an otherwise complex calculation of combat odds like those numerous DRMs being overburdened in other WW1 games.  The game plays fairly quickly, with an afternoon to finish the short 7-turns campaign scenario. There is a lot of decision on the German side too, whether he should revert to the otherwise cancelled Schlieffen Plan by reinforcing the right flank attack into Belgium. 

You use CAPs in the action phase (Command Administrative Points) to activate your units to conduct movement and combat, strategic movement or undisrupt units. Units of the Allied different nationalities can stack, move and combat together normally. Each side can spend as many CAPs as he wants if CAPs are available. Activation is counted by hex and so you could not pick up new units into the Army but you could always drop off units.  The no. of CAPs available is determined on which general is in command. Do not confuse this CAPs concept with the initiative.  You win the intiative by rolling a higher dice (from turn 4 onward) but you may spend CAPs as long as you have them.  Initiative would be passed to your opponent when you execute 2 activations in a row.  The initiative is passed back to you once the opponent spent his CAPs too.  2 consecutive passes by both players end the turn.  Otherwise, CAPs can be spent on replacements in the replacement phase prior to the action phase.

The placement of the units onto the battle board for a reminiscent of the WWI linear tactics is quite intriguing along with the reserve placement.  The reserve placement is only done when you outnumber your enemy units with undisrupted full strength infantry or cavalry units.  The attacker has the initiative advantage whereby the defender gets to place his defending units first and then the attacker has the choice to place his undisrupted units to attack those already disrupted, capitalizing on the reduced units for complete elimination.  I like this very nice rule on simulating the WWI battles.    

There are quite a few scripted scenario special rules to the historical movement like mandated Plan 17 Attack into Germany because of the French elan (read ignorance), BEF goes it alone (meaning that they won't go to the sea but inland towards Paris.  Allied also lose VP for this.), the Schileffen Plan restrictions where the German units also could not enter the coastal hexes unless there were Allied combat units ("without my plan you are going nowhere!"), the initial Allied movement restrictions on the first game turn (only 4 specific hexes are allowed to be activated.  The Turn Record Track missed one hex named for this.), the Belgians could never leave Belgium, and the East Front choice faced by the German High Command (remove your units or lose your command,i.e. VPs, gentleman).  The first 3 turns even fix the initiative beforehand with specific actions.  It is a matter of taste whether you like it or not but they are trying to impose a sense of what's happening by that time and the limited strategic options right away when you begin the game.  Sometimes you feel so scared to do anything in violation of this or that specific rules, particularly on the first turn to an extent the Allied might want to pass the turn outright. With the Maubeuge (Mons) movement restriction, the Allied could not even reinforce the city in the first turn.  Without the option to entrench (only available after turn 6 of the German General Withdrawal, 6 weeks into the war), the only viable solution seems to be moving the French 5th Army forward to Givet seeing the imminent Belgian collapse at Namur.  Luckily, these rules are reminded summarily on the turn record track quite nicely.    

Some errata were noted on the rules e.g. there were no rule 3.2.4a or 3.2.4c in the rulebook per the turn sequence.  The Turn Record Track missed the hex 54 as one of the Allied activation hexes etc.  Plan 17 VPs are "started" on turn 3 on the Turn Record Track but I am not sure where to find the rule in the rulebook saying this.  The rule organization is while not generally not easy to follow unless you have an index (check the one here in BGG. It would be useful). 

The campaign game is 15-turns long.  With an average 5 to 6 CAPS per turn, it means there are 75 to 90 moves you make the whole game.  A lot of actions and a lot of the dices throwing.  With an average 1 hour per turn, set aside the game and completion of the campaign game would take you about 2 full whole days.  As its name implies, it really is a "grand" game.

I don't like the very inelegant rules for moving from (un)contested hex to (un)contested hex. Also, it seems to me that the CAPS mechanics and the combat system give too much emphasis to command over manpower - Germany's real strength in August 1914. In Grand Illusion it does not matter if you are outnumbered provided you have more CAPS and 4 corps - as a result the battles are totally random. (There is no way you can have more than 4 corps in a combat as someone mistakenly states above - 8 corps vs 4 corps is impossible !)

Finally, there are many special rules to straightjacket the game into an historical course, usually the sign of a sloppy design or development.

From solitaire play, I find this a very good 'operational' level treatment of the opening West Front campaign in WWI.  The system tends to ruin attempts to achieve a consistent strategic approach or tactical gambit, so it requires an 'ad hoc' gaming mentality.  Complaints about fiddliness of rules are valid, but only up to a point: Rather than straight-jacketing choices, I think the rules put some well-considered constraints on play that might otherwise achieve wacky ahistorical outcomes, not a desirable feature for a CSG.  Thus, the game plays the player a bit, but the subject (debatably) requires this.  Enjoyable in any case.  The Designer/Develper team have been active in addressing inconsistencies in the rules.

Perfect game. Great balance between playability and simulation plus historical accuracy. If you know Ted Raicer other works you will not be disappointed by this title that is among Clash of Giants I and II and the famous Path of Glory difficulty. Game simulates perfectly the World War I spirit based on attrition and long battles with attacks and counterattacks and a lot of casualties. Combat based on simple and original battles system. Big hexes gives this game a different feeling from other wargames. Covering only Western front is one of the best on the subject (PoG apart) Fun and easy to learn, quite exciting, just try it and judge by yourself.

Originelle Verarbeitung der Geschehnisse an der Westfront 1914, wird aktuell nur noch von "Fields of Despair" übertroffen.

Rating based on one Solitaire play.
Many of the rules are inelegant but they seem to work. If you do not follow history then many are not used. The fact that the French/Belgians destroyed bridges/tunnels in the north does not mean it would not have happened in the south if the Germans had broken through there. Therefore the game needs a general rule for this or no rule. The specific one makes no sense.
Having little time to game I think I will play other games - SOLD

Itching to give this a try. Rules need careful reading as this is an innovative approach. Map looks superb. Not so the box. Even if it based upon a 1916 French poster.

For me it captured the 1914 western front campaign well and the pace of the game flows quickly since each side may only spend two CAPs at a time. The rules are not complex but I feel the rulebook could have been better. I had questions that the rules did not cover, like how the allied may send his 3 others CAPs on turn one. I have two minor complaints one the map hex numbers were hard to read and two the German reinforcement units turn and hex on their printing didn't have the background white like the allied counters. In Grand Illusion they did something that wish they would do in more games. They have the large counters which identify die roll modifiers and battle situations that are used for combat rolls. I also liked the fortunes of war table, it added a twist for a game on this scale. Fairly good game

I really like the approach taken here. This reminds more of the book Guns of August than the old AH game Guns of August.

Greatly enjoyed Grand Illusion, and no problems picking it up - rules pretty good actually. I can't wait to hear if the historical analysis pans out because as a game (and gameable situation) it is a cracker. A real feel of not being a hex based game, though the supply rules give it many abstract game qualities. Loved the Fortunes of War rolls, some of which gave us some marvellously chaotic turns. Didn't mind the iron maiden stuff too much. Action Points work well to restrict your choices and keep some areas quiet. Cavalry fun to use, we had a couple of glorious charges. As the Germans I made some massive mistakes, such as failing to get enough replacements, and wrecked about four armies, but after 4th Mons (!) did finally bust the line leaving the BEF in tatters. It was bloody. I know what I would do if I played again, but I am hopeful this one threw up lots of historic stuff. I would query the supply and the troop replacement accuracy, but that is only on gut feeling. The former may just be very clever way of solving it. About 4 hours.

Great game! Great historical feel and great playability. Very unbalanced (in favour of the German) but it's still tons of fun! I would give it a 9 if the rulebook wasn't such a mess...

edit: This really is a beautiful and awesome game, despite its flaws. Rating increased.

This had the potential to be a great game and it still might be - however I'd be surprised if any two players are playing by the same rules, which is why I score it so low.

The rules are a mess, although the developer disagrees with me strongly on this. I pointed out the sheer number of queries and clarifiactions raised on consimworld and the fact that they had to change rules and then change the changes.

Shows a lack of developement

Poor rules. More, the design has some points very little elegant. Very doubtful simulation. The worse work of Ted Raicer.

The game is good and dynamic, things keep moving, and the combat system is very nice.
But the rules are AWFUL. Absolutely terrible. Some sentences are not even complete (look at the first sentence at the top of page 13...). And no index... So I compiled my own (it's in the files section). Makes things flow better during gameplay.

Interesting take on the beginning of WW1 in Belgium and France.  Not very difficult, recommended.

The game develops on a smooth way, with lots of tense dice rolling for each side.
Maybe it restricts the player to act equal than his historical counterparts, but the game still is interesting and fun.

I played this several times when it was published, both solo and PBEM. I was initially enthusiastic, and did not find the rules as problematic as many others seem to have, but the the more I played the game the less I liked it.

Like most Ted Raicer games, play is heavily scripted - you SHALL do this, you shall NOT do that - and deviations from the pre-planned narrative are not encouraged. Though there are elements of the design I still like, in the end the scripting just killed the fun. I felt the game should have come with instructions rather than rules.

 Still looking for that perfect 1914 game.

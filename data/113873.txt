I am thoroughly enjoying this game.  I know some people think there is little decision making to be made.  With the B-17 game (which I also enjoy playing), you basically chose which gunner was going to be firing at which plane and maybe making a choice to drop out of formation in order to save crew members from frostbite if the heater went out.  There are more decisions with German U-Boats.  Day or night; surface attack or submerged; close, medium, or long range; exceeding test depth to avoid escort detection; using deck guns or torpedoes; which kind of torpedoes to use; engaging an escorted ship or not; following a damaged ship or not.  I chose to engage a second ship in an escorted convoy after already sinking one, which in turn lead to my sub being sunk...my point is, my decision affected the outcome of the game.

RATING: 7
Excellent solitaire game. It passes the 3P's to Prep, Play and Put away and as a bonus - pick back up on if you are still patrolling! Sure there's die rolling for outcomes but what solitaire game doesn't ?! The simplicity that continues to provide tension is the awesomeness of this game.

A bit long, but an interesting take on running a sub. There's a press-your-luck element, a management of assets, knowing when to press and when to hang back... my one play (thus far) has been enjoyable.

There was also excitement, which I thought was a nice touch. ;)

One of the best war-games I’ve seen in recent years that melds historical detail with playability. A high rating despite the fact that the rules and play charts were Living almost on release. But here this is no problem. The game almost feels roleplaying-like in nature. Rules and charts accordingly, suit binders. And the main play aids - the counters, the U-Boat Mat, the Combat Mat, and Patrol Log sheet that run game, are good out of the wrapper as is. Download the latest Living Rules, Living Play Charts and many user extras - and head off to sea. It’s engrossingly, very easy to do.

A good game, albeit too repetitive.  It's fun trying to push thru a career given how quickly the simulated time flies in this game.  The rulebook is very well-written, which is worth mentioning given the well-deserved notoriety of wargame rulebooks.

A video reviewer and game enthusiast said this game captured lightning in a bottle with it's play system. Such a smooth process going through the mission steps and patrol zones. Sometimes you can blow through a patrol in 5 minutes and see nothing. Others bring a huge juicy target and you do everything to try and sink it.

Other times you're at the end of your career and you get caught in the death spiral of trying to evade detection and you pray all those games and records don't end up being all-for-naught!

Absolutely GREAT game by Greg Smith!!

RATING: 6.5
1st edition, 2nd printing.  Good game for a low price, but feels similar to B-17: Queen of the Skies--it tends to be mostly about dice-rolling.  Some good choices, but if you roll badly, there's no clear way to recover.  Again, like B-17, if you're in it for the story arc, then this can generate whole novels worth of material.

RATING: 9
Based on one campaign with a Type VIIC, 12 patrols and 15 targets sunk.  Not every patrol is dramatic, but my last patrol where I got depth charged again (and again) until I had to surface and scuttle the ship certainly was tense...

The dice determine a lot of the action, so yes there is luck (in a submarine game? preposterous!), but there are many decisions here.  You can take risks and pay for it as I did as I was nearing the end of my campaign in 12/42.  A cautious U-Boat captain may be satisfied to wait for better opportunities, fire submerged, at night, and at long range only, but you run the risk of sinking nothing on a patrol.  Too much of that will lead to a low score.

The game easily deserves an eight, I'm boosting it to a nine based on all the tutorials and videos consimpress put together in helping players get up and running.  I haven't seen that level of support before and appreciate it.

Why did i wait so much for this title. A dice fest like the B-17 series. Dice were probably used also to write down the rules, boring and painful to master them. Not my preferred mechanics, so far it seems that DVG U-Boat Leader keeps better the atmosphere.  Yes you can create some narrative but to be sunk is a great relief. 

EDIT: after a full campaign i raised the vote by 1... with the help of the tools made available here the game flows a little better and the narrative starts to appear... but the general feeling is confirmed.

This is a good simulation game with a fun narrative.  Not a lot of strategic decisions but I find it a lot of fun to play. You do not have to play the entire campaign in one sitting. I can leave it set up and play a patrol or even just one encounter and pick right up where I left off.

This game is by no means among the best solitaire wargame designs out there.

There aren't many different decisions to be made when you are patrolling the ocean in search of ships to sink. It certainly offers more problem solving and decision making than a purely mechanical game like B-17, but it still feels a lot like a game in which you are taking a fun ride rather than solving a challenging strategic puzzle.

And it has an additional problem that is very common amongst submarine warfare games: it is repetitive. 

In terms of production of components, I was not impressed either. The play mats are really bad. My current rating is based on the usage of a beautiful map and a submarine blue print created by a fellow BGGer. If I were to play using the original play mats, my rating would be significantly lower.

In summary, The Hunters is a fun game, if you enjoy the story that will develop around the patrolling mechanics. But it is not a very brilliant solitaire design.

RATING: 6
The core mechanics are simple: try to torpedo ships, try to not to get detected, try and survive the damage and detection loop, hope you don't see planes. It's surprisingly addictive. You never know what's going to happen next. Most games with a strong integrated theme can produce stories after a game, but this one can generate stories per patrol. I'd rate it higher, but getting stuck in a detection loop that you can't break, but you are only receiving 1 or 2 hits per loop gets boring and frustrating and isn't a dramatic way to end a game. If you never get sunk, playing a full game from 1939 to 1943 gets a bit repetitive too. And sometimes your U-Boat just can't find any ships, which is boring.

Initial Impression: This is a strange game for me. The game really has a great narrative aspect to it and produces interesting session reports. However, the dice rolling and chart lookups are interspersed with decisions that feel too simple and binary. The game is not about submarine warfare so much as it's about the career of a submarine crew. It feels as if all the interesting parts were abstracted away. This game is on my 10x10 for 2014 so will get more plays.

10 Plays: I now feel as if I've experienced all that this game has to offer. This game has boiled down to simple die rolling and chart lookups for me. I've gotten to the point where I hope that something goes wrong during my patrol (ie. my sub is detected and depth charges are damaging my ship) as those are the only exciting parts for me.

I've traded away my copy of the game.

RATING: 9
     The rules and components of this game are fantastic.  I read through the rules quite thoroughly before playing and have been impressed by how well they are presented so that I can look up things if I have a question during game play.  In addition, there is a nice summary of the major steps of play on the combat mat, which makes progressing from one step to the other very easy.  Components seem very sturdy and are attractive.  Game play varies from nothing going on to the tenseness of battle and depth charges.  The Hunters does a great job of replicating U-Boat warfare without bogging down in minutia.
     The one thing I'm not sure about is that if a player does well early, it seems like he could go on for the rest of the campaign resting on his laurels, and completely avoid any risk by refusing combat.  This would not be a problem in the two player version or in tournaments.

RATING: 9
Good story teller and enjoyable solo game for you as a German U BOAT Commander in WW2.

Lots of flair and story telling and with the right sources on the internet, you can even find out what happened to your U-Boat in WW2 for real. As it appears I chose a IXB Type (U64) and started in Apr 1940, just the moment this UBoat was shot to pieces in Northern Europe in a harbour. So I guess I played the alternate and prolonged history of this vessel.

Now this is only a story teller really, not much "gaming" or decision making around. But like its sister game B17 it is the narritive that makes it work.

You try to survive and sink as much tons as possible.

Very easy to learn for a wargamer, a non wargamer will have to wrestle through all of the charts though. 

The Hunters is like watching a TV series and is pleasant to play. Good for a few session I think, but don't over do it.

Glad to have it and I don't think I will sell it as it is always easy to return to once a year or so for a full campaign.

Sessions last around an hour. A campaign can be anything between 2/3 session up to 10 or more.

Very few Commanders survived the war, as it is in this game which lasts until 1943.

Added another 0.4 points as the tension at the end of the Campaign to survive is immense.

Top 30 materiel after 11 Patrol sessions and 1 complete Campaign

Wanted to love it, but it really is just a retread of Avalon Hill's B-17, with slightly higher production values. Solo gaming has come a long way since those days, and other than nostalgia, I see no reason to play this game when titles like Field Commander: Napoleon, D-Day at Omaha Beach and RAF: The Battle of Britain 1940 exist.

A friend of mine loaned his copy to me when I asked him about good solo games.  As a 'fan' of WWII both historically and as a game theme, I was really excited to play.  The first game took two sessions and several hours to complete, because I was constantly checking the rule book, internet, and BGG forums to clarify rules.  Though lengthy, the rules are very well written...the problem was I just skimmed them before getting started.  After I finished the first game, I almost immediately started another game and the play went much faster.  The length of a game will vary with how successful you are but I would expect most games to take between 60-90 minutes.

Logistically, there is some amount of tedium in the game mechanics.  There are lots of little tiles to move around to keep track of status, position, and combat encounters.  And I hope you like rolling dice because that's what you'll be doing for the next hour or so.  It's a bit frustrating trying to keep all of the charts and tables organized enough to find what you need but after a few plays you start to memorize some of the more frequently used tables so it becomes a bit more streamlined.  

The game opens itself to several styles of play.  You can choose to carefully select your targets by only going for the biggest ships, or try to sink everything in your path.  You can charge into a convoy like a fox in a hen-house and take your chances with the escorts, or slink around picking off easy targets then fading into the deep.  

I like the way the game takes into account the changing tides (no pun intended) of the war.  The changes that shift encounters in favor of the Allies as the war progresses seemed subtle at first glance, but they definitely have a huge impact and play out well.  I suddenly found it impossible to shake off the convoy escorts who were rattling my boat to pieces with cascades of depth charges, when earlier in the game it seemed almost comically easy to slip through their nets.  Those juicy targets silhouetted against the horizon didn't seem nearly as appealing as they did a scant few months ago, and daylight literally became the bane of my existence while air patrols let me know just how a rabbit feels when the shadow of a hawk darkens his otherwise lovely day.

Thinking about life on a submarine, the game has an authentic "feel".  A U-boat captain relied heavily on his charts, calculated risks, and blind luck to be successful and that's just how I felt playing the game.  A good crew can save your boat, while one unlucky depth charge can send you to the bottom of the sea in an instant.  I found myself indignant at missing out on promotions ("But..but..look at what I have accomplished for the Fatherland!!"), and beaming with pride when Oakleaves  were added to my Knight's Cross.

There are several optional rules one can incorporate to add complexity or realism to the game.  I only lightly experimented with a couple so I can't attest to their effectiveness.  

Overall, I found this game highly enjoyable with plenty of suspense and action.  It has a much more adversarial feel than most solo games I've played, so you kind of have a sense you are playing an actual opponent.  I can see playing it several times and if you don't mind managing all the charts and tiles and dice rolls, I think it has a decent amount of replay value.  Personally I think it will be a staple in my gaming rotation, with a game or two every few months.

Excellent game! Once past the reading, it is not as hard as I first thought. Best thing about it is that a patrol can be played in 30 minutes. That is great for when you don't have much time.
Some aspects are a bit unrealistic, like not being able to attack escorts or take evasive action. However, those issues have been addressed in "The Hunted" expansion.
I highly recommend this game!

Edit: with the addition of "The Hunted", I bump my rating from a 9 to a 10. Pure awesomeness! :)

This is tough. Not as tough as commanding a submarine in WW2 but I really feel the struggle of doing it.
Do I keep on trying to hit from a safe distance or do I risk a hit and run from short distance?

The moment when you spread out everything for the first time can be a bit overwhelming but the design of the game is so simple that you start to "know" the game after five minutes.

Really fun but really hard as well. I love it.

There are very few decisions to make in this game. There is some tension in the game, though. It reminds me of the old game "B-17".
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The game does succeed in creating a nice narrative and is quite easy to learn.  What it lacks is that feeling of tough decision making where the odds are not obvious and so planning requires some thought before trusting lady luck.  Here, you quickly move to identification of a target and the decision making is too simple (change day to night, surface or not, close in or medium range).

I had no expectations, so I'm neutral on this game.  It will get a few plays to really understand the system, but it is likely to be moved quickly down to the "archives".  I cannot see this game becoming a staple of my solitaire gaming experience.

I enjoyed this, as it became relatively quick to pick up and involves some decisions. I do wish it had more of the role playing aspect Ambush! and B-17 gave me. Definitely has a bit of an "on rails" feel, but fun nonetheless.

It has finally arrived!  12/19/13.  Cannot wait to go out on my first patrol!  :)

After 8 plays I can say that this is the most fun I have ever had with a submarine game.  It is tense and nerve wracking!  It reminds me a lot of B-17 but with one key difference: here you actually get to make the same decisions that sub commanders did during WWII.  For those who might say there is not much decision making her, I would say it is the same that was made historically.  You even get to try to lobby for a patrol you want!  So this game is high on the :cool: meter and if you love sub games you MUST add this to your collection!!

Interesting enough game for solo play.  You must be in the right kind of re-enactment simulation mood to enjoy it, I fear if I lose my concentration I will see it as the series of dice rolls that it is.  There are some choices involved, but those are mostly just how far are you willing to push your luck.  My first game I went through 3 patrols, surviving and sinking quite a few ships (I think) in 2 of those patrols, while coming up with no encounters at all in one of them.  I am currently liking this game, but already have fears over how long it could hold me.  Also, god-damn duds.  Duds suck.

Only my top ten "Stuck on a deserted island" games get a '10'.  The Hunters easily makes it in the top of the others.

After reading some of the comments from those that panned the game, I decided to rate and comment on the game myself.

Most of those that panned the game commented (if they even left a comment) that it was too boring or was just a bunch of dice rolling.  I suppose that's correct for those that either don't have or decide not use their imagination.  Perhaps they don't like Axis and Allies because of all the dice rolling and all those stupid plastic blobs, whatever they are.  Every game requires players to use their imagination to some extend (well, except maybe for Craps - which is literally just a bunch of "dice rolling").  The Hunters is one of those rare games that allows the player to really immerse themselves in an intense storyline, should they choose to be immersed.

The Hunters can be played fast (2-3 hours), or slowly (played in parts over several evenings), depending entirely on how involved they choose to get.  Either way it can be intense.

Playing it fast, I can certainly understand how it would become just a game of dice rolling.  Playing it slower, it becomes more of an adventure.  Every patrol and every campaign is different.

Personally, I like to immerse myself in the 'role playing' aspect of the game.  I'll keep a ships log to record the events and encounters.  I don't go out on a patrol to just the 'British Isles', I patrol off the northeast coast of Scotland, in the vicinity of Edinburgh.  After learning the basic (dice rolling) mechanics of the game, I've incorporated role playing aspects that have greatly increase my enjoyment.  There's tons of playing aids available here on BGG.com, including realism modules and even an unofficial follow on, The Hunted, designed by Greg Smith the designer.

If you're one that is interested in U-Boats of the Battle of the Atlantic, I highly recommend The Hunters.  If you don't like dice rolling, well definitely don't play Craps...or Yahtzee.

I really wanted to like this more than I did. The subject is wonderful. The procedural rolling dice and consulting tables can work for me (I agree with calandale's comment about it being meditative in a way) but it just didn't here. Partly that seems due to a lack of meaningful decisions. All of this results in a lack of immersion for me. Sold.

EDIT: military storytelling games are not for me. Still, the below critique stands.

Highly thematic and immersive ww2 dice fest sub sim. Beyond the steep learning curve (do download the flowchart, if you value your sanity) it provides, beyond the excellent simulational and storytelling value, a package that plays smoothly and is full of agonizing situational decisions. 

It plays relatively quickly too, and can be also played in bite chunks. Recommended.

I'm torn on this game.  On one had, it's really cool and intense playing as a German submarine captain.

Highly enjoyable solitaire game best played in heads up style with one person playing the U-boat and the other person rolling the dice and putting on the pressure. I then recommend changing sides so each person can run his "solitaire game".  I recommend this game to anyone who likes real history of the submarine warfare in WWII.  The game was thoroughly researched and feels very realistic from the "Happy Days" to the stress by late in the war as to whether or not one would survive their U-boat sortie and come back alive.

RATING: 8
A great solo game of simulating a campaign in a U-Boat.  You feel an attachment to your boat and crew as together you hunt allied shipping, and occasionally a British capital ship. But beware, as you hunt them, they will start hunting you.  Intense action trying to survive multiple depth chargings that any one could result in the end of your career and the loss of all hands.  

As you play through patrols you will level your crew, yourself as commander, and try for the coveted Knights Cross and it's levels.  

Happy Hunting.

The Hunters was initially addictive, but lacked staying power for me. Ultimately, I didn't feel like my choices were significant. Instead, the game seemed to progress with each dice roll, regardless of my involvement.

A very boring dice and chart solitaire game, in which the player has very few meaningful decisions. The components are average but the first printing has plenty or errors in the player aid cards. The theme isn't very well conveyed either. Replay value is abysmal, since all U boat types play exactly the same, and the mechanics are horribly repetitive. Avoid this one, unless the theme is the only thing that matters to you.

Just one game so far. The game is exactly what I expected, which is both good and bad. It offers a nice narrative game which makes you envolved in the game experience, however the decisions to be made are fairly straightforward and quite repetetive. This is a game I suspect I will bring to the table once, then put it away for quite some time before I bring it up for another play after which it goes back on the shelf again. Not a game I will play again and again and again for a period of time.

Sweet mother of god, I'm happy I sat through my first game and sorted out the rules.  Not being used to wargame-y charts and mechanics, this was a bit of a slog (5 hours!), but the last 45 minutes or so flew by once I got all the little exceptions figured out.

Almost absurdly streamlined gameplay, but there is definitely a feeling of impending doom as the end of the war approaches.  By 1943, it's pretty hard to get away from an escorted ship or convoy without taking massive damage.

Good little game, not difficult to play at all, plays very much like B-17: Queen of the Skies, where you keep track of your submarine's status and roll on various tables to see what happens. The decisions come in during the weapon load out, when to engage and when not to and what to do during an engagement. 

Tells the story of the career of a submarine commander. Its not for everyone as not everybody likes a game full of tables to roll on, but this game doesn't have too many and the game play is very fast and a session can easily be finish in one sitting.

Probably my first and (so far) only true love in gaming. The theme of the game and the stories it builds of my adventures just work so well for me. 

The sequel "Silent Victory" is slightly better, but I'll always prefer The Hunters. It took the PC games Silent Hunter III and V and turned them into a dice game. I don't have a PC any more but I can pull The Hunters off my shelf any time I like and hunt down some Allied merchant ships in the cold waters of the Atlantic. I love it!

Be warned, it's mostly dice rolling and chart checking, without a great deal of player agency, but if you can immerse yourself in the theme and enjoy the ride, you're in for a fun time.

This game feels very much like B-17 in a sub. There are more decisions in The Hunters but it is still mostly dice rolling and checking charts, I always love these type of games just for the story. If you like solitaire games or you were a B-17 fan then you will love this game.

A very interesting solo wargame simulating a tour as a German U-boat captain in WWII. There are a lot of dice rolls and look-up charts, but it still captures the imagination.

Finally got it to the table, and I'm liking in, tooling around in my underdog U-30.  Especially after they survived an air attack that forced an abort of a mining mission.  I do need to put more mileage on it to see if it grows on me more.  I'm still not seeing on the decision points that makes it better than a dice orgy, but then I haven't tangled with the escorts yet.

Components are pretty good, functional, if unexciting.  To me it hurts a bit without a map.  All the charts a little underwhelming.

RATING: 6
This is a quick play.  I like the mission selection and patrol phases (love the patrol track), like the U-Boat mat, but the Tactical phase is a little weak for me.  

Seems like the only key decision is the attack range, and that seems pretty straight forward to me (medium range with escort, close range without escort).  You also have to decide how many torpedoes to assign to each attacked ship.  U-Boat depth doesn't matter a lot except for firing guns. Day/Night doesn't matter except for Night Surface attack (+1 modifier).  No maneuvering between Escorts to close on merchants.  No weather effects.  U-Boats are about stealth and silently approaching a target and sinking it before anyone knows it's there.  I don't get that feeling in the game. 

Also, the U-Boat crew doesn't seem to be as involved with U-Boat operations as I had hoped.  The IWO was involved with surface attacks, but not here.  The IIWO was involved with Flak and Gun attacks, but not here.  

A lot of thought was put into the game (missions, u-boat types, damage,...).  But I prefer a more tactical approach to games, so this one doesn't do it for me.

RATING: 8.5
Really like it, a patrol can be played quite quickly (within 30 minutes) but the career will take a while (a dozen or so patrol).
I wish it had a bit more bling, but that is because I come from a miniature games background and I am a sucker for shinnies.
The game engine is solid and using players aid makes this game a solid addition to my solitaire games.
Highly recommend it, just wish it wasn't so historically accurate during transit when very little happens.

RATING: 7
After a dozen plays this game has worn thin. The first two games were great but I think I've mastered what little strategy there is in the game so all that is left is dice rolling. I think if I play this a dozen more times my dice tray will end up with a hole worn through the bottom.

[i]Pros:[/i]

- The game does have a good narrative and you do become attached to your crew. After a while all the narratives kind of run together so you don't remember certain captains or subs but instead a few crazy moments which you'll have to play a few hours to get one truly stand out event.

- The funnest part, sadly, is getting depth charged. It's fun to roll the dice to see what area of your submarine will get damaged but unfortunately there isn't much you can do to mitigate the damage. You'll get a chance to roll some more dice afterwards to see if anything got repaired but again...pretty random.

[i]Cons:[/i]

- So much dice rolling. I understand that simulating submarine warfare is hard to make exciting in a game and so far the Hunters has been the best for me but how about some encounter cards or something? Roll to see if there is an encounter, roll to see what ships you spot. Assign torpedoes to targets (which you have the choice of two different torpedo types) roll, to hit, roll for duds, roll for damage, chart chart chart. 

Encounter cards would speed up gameplay immensely. 

- It plays like a movie but instead of being the director of the movie you are watching it. The dice make all the decisions.

- There are no important decisions. You choose what ship to target and you have a 50% chance of scoring one hit and 50% chance of scoring more than one hit and there's nothing you can do to alter this dice roll.

- I wish there were more than two special missions.


[b]Conclusion:[/b] A fun game to play while sitting in front of the tv but there's not a lot in this game that gets me fully engaged or gets me wanting to come back for another play.

7/10

The Hunters is a smooth-playing simulation of German WWII U-Boat operations, at a single ship level.

It is based on table-driven encounters, and is similar in play and flavor to B-17 by report, though victory is determined by the success of one's attacks, not just survival.

I found it simple enough to complete the setup and to begin play without having read the full ruleset, though this did require a little searching to find some rules- the Index is very helpful in this.

It's an addictive solo game, and plays through missions quickly enough that one can rattle off a few in short period of time.

As an added bonus, because the time to play a single mission can be quite short, and space needed not too extensive, this makes for a quick playing wargame, with excellent variability for playtime as the situation dictates.

I am starting this at a solid 7 rating, and wouldn't be surprised if I have to raise that soon.

Sounds great and will beat those computer games that keep crashing!

Finally bought this. Can't wait to play.

Playing through my 1st campaign and I must say what a great game this is! The expectation and tension of those die rolls is palpable. I have played Silent Hunter II on pc and I've experienced the hight and lows of submarine patrols in that game. This game mirrors those same highs and lows. Yes you don't have the visuals and sound effects of a computer game but you do have that same emotional experience, especially when you come under attack and start praying that the damage will only be minor and hoping you have no casualties. Easily a 10!

Looks and sounds like a rather bland excercise in dice rolling and seeing what happens.

And mechanically, there really aren't THAT many decisions to make. You have to make a couple before facing your fate in form of a series of die rolls.

But this mixture of deciding what to do and then seeing the events unfold, somehow manages to create an exciting and intense narrative which puts you on the edge of your seat.

Surprisingly fun solo game!

After 3.5 years of waiting das boot finally arrived at my home port! The solo game experience is as good as i have been waiting for, the legacy of the [thing=1032][/thing] continues but B17 is the undisputed King of the genre. Having said that, The Hunters is an excellent uboat boardgame out there and it will remain the best for many many years to come, my initial rating is 8.5 but it will go higher i believe..

This is not a game, this is a career-level narrative generator. The so called player can make almost no real decisions. The most important one is picking U-Boat type at the beginning of career. During combat you can choose range of the attack and assign torpedoes to targets during attack. Range is always straightforward (no escort=short range, escorts=medium range), assigning torpedoes seems irrelevant as luck is decisive anyway (you can sink a ship with 1 torpedo or miss it with 4). Most of the time you have to roll the dice and watch the results of escort attacks and detection. In other words there are no tactical choices to be made. On one of the patrols I had to roll dice about 30 times in a row without making a single decision! It's a game against the odds, nothing else. Too bad. I'm interested in U-Boats and really wanted to love this game but after 1,5 year of waiting this game feels like a disappointment.

On the good side: production values are good and career narrative can actually be interesting. The problem is that at some point rolling the dice becomes too tedious.

April 2014: Too boring. Sold.

This game has a very nice and productive community.
Quick set up.
Single patrols can be played in a short time and are part of a large campaign.
There are meaningful decisions in the game without being a brain pretzel but it is also  a luck based dice game and feels like a roguelike.

Really good solitaire game.  I P500'd it in 2011, and nearly forgot about it before it finally shipped, and it was worth the wait.  Almost a perfect solitaire game.

It isn't too fiddly, but definitely gives some good decision making opportunities.  My only detraction is that there really isn't enough maneuvering of the boat while attacking and evading.  I think if that was elaborated slightly, it would become an excellent game (but might need to be opposed to work best).  Indeed, it is the simplicity that allows it to play so smoothly as a solitaire game, so it's just fine the way it is.

RATING: 6
A U-boat solitaire game that allows you to try to survive multiple patrols from 1939 to 1943. Has role playing elements were you improve your crew skills. Naming the crew members helps. Overall the game is okay and provides a decent simulation. However it would be better as an ipad game. A little more chrome could help and I would recommend some of the download files in BGG make it better. Take it or leave it.

Consimpress venture into the U-Boats warfare.  P500 through GMT website.  The following paragraph of game description convinced me:

"The Hunters is purposely designed to deliver a brisk yet intensive gaming experience that forces many decisions upon you as you will take command among the major German U-boat models in service during WWII, and try to complete an entire tour."

"350+ named shipping targets"!

Well, it was increased to 500+ named shipping targets at the back of the box!  
 
I will see if it can turn out as it should.

RATING: 5
I like solitaire games that deliver difficulty, a compelling narrative, or more ideally both, in a manageable timeframe. The Hunters delivers a fantastic narrative: By the end of my first play, I felt connected to my crew and was even filling in the "story between the lines" -- for example, wondering if my commander had ticked someone off politically, because he was incredibly successful but not terribly high in rank.

But my first game took 5.5 hours, much too long, and it wasn't terribly difficult. I checked to make sure I wasn't missing something major rules-wise, which I wasn't (the biggest thing I missed was being able to fire my deck gun twice; I know I missed a modifier here and there as well), and I finished game one as the most decorated U-Boat commander in history: 17 patrols, 36 ships and 319,300 tons sunk, including a capital ship; I received the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds...and was killed by an aircraft just a couple months short of retirement. Given that I don't consider myself terribly good at games, this makes me wonder whether future plays will be just as easy.

Then again, there's a lot of luck in this game: I came within one hull point of being sunk mid-game, in pursuit of a piddly little convoy, and was eventually killed by an aircraft while returning home, just a few months before retirement. A bad die roll earlier could certainly have ended me.

As for the 5.5 hours, I was savoring the experience and in no particular hurry. It's not a complex game, at least relative to my level of experience with wargames (relatively low), and the rulebook and reference cards are fantastic and very clear. It wouldn't take me that long next time, but it might still be longer than I'd like.

I found the level of decision-making in the game satisfying, though a bit lower than I usually like. A lot of it is risk management and deciding when to push your luck, both things I enjoy in games. My approach to sinking ships made a difference in how things turned out; it's not a game of blind luck with no opportunities to influence your sub's destiny. And man, that narrative! The twists and turns of my career, the patrols where I never saw a ship, the crewmen I lost -- it was all vivid and interesting, doubly so because outside of watching Das Boot I've never had any real interest in German submarine warfare. (I've also never played the bad guys in an historical wargame before, as far as I can recall.)

In the end, I've written an awful lot here about a game I currently rate a 7, which tells me it's one worth keeping. I'm not sure how varied future plays will feel, although I know the events and details will all vary; it seems like it could feel sort of same-y from game to game. I do wish it were shorter, and I may discover that it needs to be harder (both of which could be remedied by starting at a later date in the war), but I dig it.

---

Nonetheless, a game this long, and a game I did that well at the first time out, isn't going to hit the table often enough. Lowered it to a 5 and sold it after one play.

A great simulation/storytelling experience. Is it fun? Sometimes but like many games I like its more of a story experience and less of a truly balanced game.

Tip - make ship counters for the targets and pull them out of a cup. This removes half he charts from the game and speeds things up considerably.

Update: raised my rating after returning to the game. I consider the retail game a 6.5 but it's a much better game with upgraded components provided by the BGG community.

Easy game to learn and play.  The designer chose game play over complexity which allows for a quick flow to the game, yet still managed to capture the essence of U-Boat warfare.  While there are a number of die rolls to process combat, which are modified both positively and negatively based on the tactical decisions made, the inherent luck involved just 'feels' right given the nature of this type of combat.  This is an excellent solitaire game.

Players are in charge of a U-Boat as commander in this solo-specific light wargame. The game itself is driven largely by random roll tables but of course there are meaningful decisions to make between each of the many phases that dictate the play. 

The aim of the game is to try and sink as much tonnage of allied shipping as possible without being killed, captured or scuttled. 

During play you will need to consider your compliment of torpedoes, whether you attack by day or night and whether you opt for surface or submerged attacks. 

Your crew can gain experience or be injured or killed, you can gain promotion and special honours and as the war progresses you may be given charge of more advanced U-Boats. 

The game may sound simple enough, but it is very thematic and the big draw is the fact that a story and narrative does unfold over the course of your career. 

Whilst the game may get a little samey after 20-40 plays, it is very addictive. To enhance the game further it can be played in a tourney format against others and tonnage and careers compared. 

I look forward to exploring this one much more over the coming years as it is my first foray into a wargmae proper - albeit a light one.

Disclaimer: I have never been fond of naval games. Also, I don't care for tactical scale WWII games and I was never into role-playing games.

Needless to say, given all of the above, I purchased The Hunters with a fair amount of trepidation. I purchased the game because I really like the movie Das Boot. 

The game components are all first class; you will not be disappointed. Also very impressive is the amount of support that Consim Press has given this game. There are, I believe, 12 tutorial videos for the game at CSW. This was a real boon for me because one of my problems with naval games has been reading rules when I don't understand many of the naval concepts. I always got bored reading about concepts I wasn't familiar with and quickly shelved the game. But with the many videos for The Hunters, I was playing the game within a few hours. 

The game plays quickly and seems accurate but my knowledge of U-boat warfare is virtually nil. I played it with my wife, giving her a U-boat and we had a lot of fun. The nice thing is, if you don’t have a lot of time, you can play a monthly patrol, put the game away and pick it up later where you left off. My wife really appreciated that aspect of the game.

So while this certainly isn’t my sort of game as far as subject and scale and though I’m not head-over-heels in love as some other gamers, I would still highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great solitaire gaming experience. It’s both classy and fun.

Update: A victim of downsizing.

My first and only solitaire only game. I love the narratives that emerge from playing this game, it always amazes me how stories appear in between all the dice rolling and table checking. On the face of it the mechanics are very dry, but there are plenty of meaningful decisions to be made which means that you always feel in control of the U-boat.

My main issue with the game is the potential for a quick and early demise, which can be disappointing if you’ve spent a while setting up a new boat and captain.

In some ways this is a push your luck dice game with an amazingly in depth WWII U-boat theme. But the way everything works together it always makes for an enjoyable experience.

The best wargame on the submarines during the WWII.
Comparatively with Uboat leader, the Hunters let's more choices to make, he's more accurate with reality (I never appreciate the 'stress' level in Uboat Leader, that's mean nothing) and the rules are more simply : the happiness !
May be the boards could be more attractives, but in the other hand they are very clear and useful.
I have just finished my first campaign, started with a VIIB in sept. 39 and finish...sunk in janv. 43 in the Atlantic with 259 300 t (attack a convoy in the 43'S is really too dangerous...). I finish FptzS with the KCO, I'm pretty proud. Thanks for the designer and the editor (very good support with videos tutorials) for this very good game.
The next game of my dreams could be the same game, but this time on the side of the convoy and the captains of the ships.

RATING: 9
A tense and atmospheric solitaire experience, helped by an appreciation of the historical subject of the WWII battle of the Atlantic. The player is the commander of a German u-boat, playing a campaign game of multiple patrols against Allied shipping. Every event is generated by dice rolls on various charts.

My first patrol ended in immediate disaster, an unlikely, against-the-odds sinking that I quickly expunged from the official Kriegsmarine records and started again. The second campaign was the polar opposite as I managed to survive until a point late in the war when my character was allowed to retire from combat duty. As that campaign progressed I became determined to achieve the unlikely and survive the war, so I sometimes did just enough to 'win' a patrol, rather than look for further glory and increase the risk of a watery grave. Even so, the later war patrols are normally pretty tough, with the Allied anti-submarine measures being far more effective. Plenty of nail-biting moments ensure 9 rating.

Besides, I [i]love[/i] rolling dice! Just the sound as they come snapping through my dice-tower. The Hunters gives me that same enjoyment that my favorite sports-sims do. Only with less stats but more bodies floating in the sea.

To scratch the submarine ich, this game does that with out undue complexity. The rules are well written with an index, and there was only one typo that I found regarding the Superior Torpedo DRM on the U2 Dud Chart. It should be +1 DRM and not -1 DRM. 

The charts and components are clear and the fonts chosen are easy on my eyes.

Narrative, narrative, narrative.   Within the solitaire genre, this is as good as it gets. I find the game provides ample opportunities for decisions that will either get you killed, or allow you to realize a successful career. The 2nd edition rule book is a work of sublime simplicity--three columns with appropriate illustrations for grasping the simple, but not simplistic game mechanisms. I predict this game will only grow in popularity with its expansions and game modules.  A wonderful gaming experience with exceptional support by the publisher. Check out the many helpful videos and after one read through you'll be ready for your first patrol. 

2nd printing moves this to a ten. Bring your imagination to the table and dive in.

At its heart, The Hunters is a press-your-luck dice rolling game. It's rather overdesigned for what it is.

I'm honestly surprised at all the 10 ratings and wonder if people are playing the same game. There are almost no decisions to make when playing--you simply roll dice over and over again. While playing, you can think to yourself, "well, these dice represent such and such," but all the narrative is all in your head. There's very little to puzzle over.

I think most people who like this are probably dyed-in-the-wool, older wargamers who haven't branched out to see what modern boardgame design has to offer.

A solo game of captaining a submarine during WWII. It's basically some smallish decisions, and a whole lotta dice rolls. There are a few ways to actively adjust the dice, but often it's, "Oh, it's 1943? Well -1 on that roll!" And there's nothing you can do about it. 

Still, it's easy to run through a quick patrol even when you're short on time.

This game gives you a realist feel of doing patrols and missions and the rules by in large are straight forward and understandable.This is one game you can build on and spice up;highly recommend you down load the merchant ship counters from the files section it is far better than rolling dice for ships,all you have to do is draw them from a bowl and sure helps with eye appeal.I've spiced it up by going to uboat.net and copying the u-boat aces pics and uboat emblems so I can put it next to my U-boat mat when I go out on patrols;for the commanders I've gave a rating from 0-5(based on how many ships they sunk during their careers),is how many rerolls you get in one patrol on the U1 table,but to active this rating number you must first sink more ships in one patrol than his rating number eg: Otto Kretschmer 5 ,must sink 6 ships to active his rating;and if they survived the war I put an 'S' on the pic means you get one save per campaign ,to reoll the die roll that killed the commander.This game is very addictive and tons of fun,the best 30 some dallors I've ever spent on a wargame in my life---now I'm looking forward to "Silent Victory",when it comes out,the pacific ,with U.S subs.

I like how there are meaningful decisions in playing the game unlike B-17. The only short comings I saw was a lack of short or introductory scenarios. One could do a later start but one is still held to the campaign victory conditions. Overall The Hunters is an excellent solitaire game. I wished it came out before U-Boat Leader which I felt was a disappointment.

[BGCOLOR=#000000][COLOR=#FFFFFF]SoloX.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] [BGCOLOR=#FF3300][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Wargame.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Not sure how this compares to Steel Wolves. I need to play my Silent War to see how I like the system, since SW is based on it.

Edit: I see now that this places you in command of a single boat, compared with SW/SW where you command the entire submarine fleet.

Update: Played Silent War and like it quite a bit, but I wonder if playing a single sub is more fun?

Got this on a recommendation from a B-17 guy. I like it a lot. Challenging with nice elements of promotion and improvement. A bit "more" developed than B-17. This is a solid solo experience. Every bit as narrative as B-17. If you like a story within your game, seek this out.

Damn this is a long wait for printing. I got in on the P500 in Feb 2017. Looks like I wont play the game till some time 2019 due to GMT's horribly slow print process. I might be able to finish a tour on a real sub and write my own board game in that time!

Rating after one play--I liked it more than I thought-- actually much more.Overall I have been underwhelmed with most solitaire games I have tried but this one is both fun and tense. Rules are very clean and still leaves enough decisions to the player without feeling scripted. Rating will probably increase after more games. I want to try some of the later boats and patrol the Med, Arctic, and off North America. The one minor issue I had was lack of a map. Even a simple point to point map instead of the patrol boxes would have increased the already great gaming experience but that isn't going to stop me from playing again.

I instantly fell in love with The Hunters, for many of the same reasons I like Ambush! so much. The narrative and roleplaying elements are very strong with this one. I really get sucked into the world of a German U-Boat Kommandant, fully immersed, head down, rolling dice, palms sweating, heart racing, blocking out the rest of the world.

I was so frustrated and sad when my first U-Boat was sunk and my Kommandant's career cut so short of the lofty goals I set for myself. When a game makes me feel for the cardboard pieces in front of me, I know I am playing something special. The Hunters is one of those games.

The Hunters is not a very complicated game, and there are plenty of resources out there that make playing even easier. A single patrol does not take very long, so it also has that "just one more patrol" thing going for it, and the next thing you know you've been playing for 5 hours straight. Its also easy to bash out a couple patrols after work before you go to bed.

An instant classic in my book, I'll be playing this for years to come.

Felt really really easy to begin with, but this turns mean and difficult as the years roll past. Need to try a different boat.

Roll through the tables. No desire to set this up again. It would make a fun app, but too much table ref.

This game reminds me greatly of B-17 Queen of the Skies, which I love. Definitely more choices in this one, do I attack, what do I attack with, etc... 
Each patrol can become very tense. You try to figure out the best way to get tonnage w/o getting sunk. Definitely feel as if this game will become a solitaire classic like B-17.

I can see why some people have felt a little let down by this game -- there's a lot of rolling on charts, and at times the game does feel like it's playing you.  For much of the game it feels like there's a list of "good practices" from which you can deviate at your peril.  
That said, I also see why this game got a second printing so quickly, because I opened the box and then spent the next five hours raiding North Atlantic convoys.  For me, narrative is the heart of a good gaming experience, and this game delivers it in spades, and I do feel as though I'm in charge even if the number of actual choices I'm making is relatively low compared to other titles.  When you're losing systems and diving deep to escape an angry destroyer, all other concerns just kind of fade away.  Looking forward to many more games of this.

This game satisfies my submarine warfare craving in ways that I haven't been able to without the aid of some older video games, or a hybrid created by a friend. GMT supports this game with some great free downloads at their site, and I'm looking forward to the expansions and the Pacific version.

I agree with what Barry Miller(bgm1961) said in https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1621487/what-i-miss-game :
... What it is though, is a great, thematic solitaire experience. ...

So this game is not a game but more of a solitaire experience. Much like Tales of the Arabian Nights (with quite a different theme :) ). I like it. Yes it's all rolling on tables but after a couple of patrols you get attached to you U-Boat and things get tense at moments.

To play it smoothly you need the Encounter Flow Chart here on BGG. It makes gameplay much smoother and less looking things up in the rulebook.

Obviously shares a lot of DNA with B-17 but clearly outshines its predecessor by centering player decision-making on the mission objective.  Whereas player control in B-17 ultimately boils down to how best to engage Luftwaffe patrols en-route to the target (and the actual bombing run is abstracted to a toss of the dice), in The Hunters the player's most important decisions relate to how best to engage and destroy Allied shipping -- the consequences of which impact the response of Allied anti-submarine warfare.  As a result, it's a much more satisfying simulation than its predecessor.

I use a personal variant:

-Table U1: surface torpedo attacks are only allowed at night except against a damaged and unescorted merchant ship with just one damage point left ("dead in the water"). In this case, the hit is automatic, just roll for dud.

-Table E2: G7a Torpedo/Day, close/long range, and Night surface attack 41+ modifiers are only applied to the first combat round.

Besides the rulebook, the game components consist of reference tables, some counters, a few dice and little else. Gameplay consists of rolling dice, checking the numerous tables for results and writing them down, and little else. For such a simple and even minimalistic approach, The Hunters creates a surprisingly deep narrative each time. Even if most of it exists only in the player's mind, especially if you're a fan of the classic movie Das Boot. Sinking enormous enemy freighters and tankers and then slipping away undetected is ever so rewarding, even if the explosions exist only as tonnage values in a spreadsheet. After learning the rules, there aren't that many new things to learn with repeated play. Replay value, if any, has more to do with imagination than novelty.

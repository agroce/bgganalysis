RATING: 6
Kashgar is a coding game in which you are building different programs and running them in loops to generate victory points. That was in technical terms. In boardgame terms, you are building a VP engine by setting up separate decks and cycling through them. The order of cards may not be changed in the decks which means that optimum play requires careful planning. There are resource management and some tactical elements to the game but building those decks is really the thing here. 

I found Kashgar quite entertaining to an extent. Maybe a tiny bit repetitive after setting up those decks, because you just cycle them until the game ends, but still entertaining. I believe there are many different ways to setup your decks which allows for different cycles but the basic strategies should be quite similar: Generate resources and buy victory points. Repeat. Could play again.

+ Very short downtime as the players get used to the cards and the rhythm of the game.

+ The potential to create very satisfying combos, that are still not overpowered.

+ Interesting balance between optimizing your caravans and getting resources/completing missions. (Solovan for the win!)

+ Nice theme and art.

+ Proved to be _very_ popular with my girlfriend, who is not that big a fan of board games. Can't wait to try it with my family, who are at "Settlers" level of board gaming.

- A bit too solitary, perhaps. We have yet to play with the more offensive cards though, they will probably address this problem.

Because I'm English and ignorant, I can't speak a word of German. That hasn't prevented me from enjoy thing excellent game. It's reasonably simple to pick up but with some excellent mechanics. If the publisher has no intention of bringing this to us English-speaking folk, I'm tempted to homebrew a sci-fi Emperor-electing politics game using the wonderful card play mechanics Kashgar uses.

Overall, the game has a refreshing/unique/interesting take on the whole deck-building mechanic. Instead of randomly drawing from your deck, players have 3 separate decks where cards are moved in an orderly queue. Thus, players attempt to manipulate both the composition and order of each deck, so that they can acquire resources/contracts efficiently. Furthermore, the game provides some tension as players race to grab contract cards.

That being said, the game is certainly more of a solitaire experience and I worry that the game may feel too samey with repeated plays.

Interesting little game where you want to add cards to your caravans to generate resources, but then those cards get in the way of getting to cards that allow you to fulfil contracts, and if you neglect those you aren't going to win.  Only played on Yucata and suspect that this one will be better face-to-face.

Guess I'll get to find out next year!  Kickstarter - due March 2018.

Unique card game with dull theme but great mechanics can see this rising in ratings with more plays.

With more plays this game remains a lot of fun but is starting to get to the point like something like dominion where I would like an expansion and not just the "mini" expansion of so called interactive cards.  I like the flow of the game but do feel an expansion that disrupts the basic system with giving you upgraded actions could make the game more varied and exciting.  It is still a great and unique game.

RATING: 6
Played with the English cards obtained from PrinterStudio as the game is only available in German. Initial impressions are that despite nice artwork the game is over produced. In essence this is a game that could just consists of 2 decks of cards and 6 different coloured cubes for each player. Instead we have a box full of air and oversized player boards to record the resources they own. The package could be less than a quarter of the size.

The idea of three caravans where the cards cycle through each is a neat idea but after that the game becomes a bit of a lottery as to what cards you will draw from either the  contracts or people (?) deck. The 3rd special deck is also a complete lottery where you can scoop big bonuses or practically nothing.

All the best strategy in the world will not secure a win for a player who draws dud cards. Sure you can try to set up scoring platforms but as an example, I couldn't pick up a card that let me secure contracts. I had money and resources coming out of my ears but nothing to spend it on. Meanwhile other players had 2-3 contract cards that meant they could accumulate points.

Just a very random and frustrating experience. Way too much luck for my taste.

Interesting in theory with nice ideas and as a deck building fan I wanted to like it, but unfortunately it doesn't catch me at all.

First of all its very random in nature. You don't have much control over which cards to add to which caravan. Makes trashers much more powerful, especially if they are not dependent on the caravan they are in. You will find out very quickly that having a card to fulfill contracts like spice merchant and another one for resources (ideally market-woman, but others work as well) makes up for an ideal two card caravan you will play again and again fromt that point on (two one card caravans would be even stronger, but this is harder to get).
All you need is a trasher for that patriarch and maybe a one time boost for gold/donkeys (due to a trashing ability or in another caravan). 

It was already mentioned that you might end up in trouble without a contract fulfiller, but there are many of them and a matriarch might get one at some point anyway. I think the right trasher might be even more critical, because they usually have a self-trashing ability - so that you cannot pick them up by matriarch. Players without them are simply in trouble because their caravans grow and grow. Strategies for big caravan like patroness simply stand no chance against a reasonable two card caravan. This is mainly because unlike Dominion there is no strategy like bying all provinces at once. Resources are limited here and more important: You still only will fulfill one contract at a time and won't catch up in points, because the point difference between contracts is not that big.
 (not to mention that a strong two card setup can usually afford the big contracts itself - at least from time to time - and doesn't have to limit so small ones. Critical in that sense are only contracts that will lose donkeys - you have to fulfill them at the end or have a strong 3 card caravan with donkeys (maybe gold) included. This is a bit slower than two cards, but still very strong and more flexible regarding contracts)

Once you get the ideal setup, winning is on top of this also very boring in execution. There are simply no decisions left. I'm afraid the game is close to broken.

My evalution is based on the base game only, that I've played several times at yucata (when all of them ended more or less the same way). In the physical game - I admittedly do not own - there is a more interactive variant included (Hauen und Stechen), that you cannot play right now at yucata. I don't know whether this will change the game to the better.

Kashgar is a deckbuilder where you build three decks at the same time. Actually it is more a "row-builder" vaguely similar to Mombasa but here you cycle through the rows and try to get the right cards in the right order to trigger combos.

Neat but nothing I desperately need.

German first edition w/ paste-ups. 

A very clever idea: a "deck-builder" with three simultaneous, face-up decks. I'm surprised this hasn't been reproduced elsewhere, because it works so well. It still gives you the "engine" feel of a traditional deckbuilder, but allows for some very careful strategic planing over several turns (with some randomness thrown in via card draws). The game is short and smooth and doesn't overstay its welcome. I'd love to see an expansion.

After a few rounds of playing with sheets showing the card translations I had a serious concern that the game would bog down as each player struggled with all the text.  But after a few more rounds we started figuring things out.  And events sped up a little as we found that only two actions needed others to act first, and turns could mostly be done in parallel.  That obviously led to the observation that the game plays out like multi-player solitaire.  That's no death knell for me, though, and if the game is good I can say I even enjoy that (much better than targetted attacking).  Here, the game is good.  I do like the mechanism, and I'm keen to try again.  I might do it with no more than three players, just to keep it clipping faster still.

Excellent "deck" builder, where the decks are three individual caravans - a row of cards fanned out into individual columns.  On a turn, a player chooses a caravan, plays the card at the bottom of the column and actions it, then moves it to the back of the column (the bottom of the deck).  Cards do a variety of things, mainly juggling the decks, the player's holdings (spices, gold and donkeys), and getting more cards into the caravans.  Players mainly play to complete contracts for points.  Fast, original, and a lot of fun.

[b][FirstImpression/PlayOn26thMARCH2014][/b] Wow, this is a different kind of deck building (maybe not the right choice of words). I didn't get what it means by deck/pool building but as soon as I played it, I was totally wowed, imypressed by how it works.

Basically, what deck/pool building works in this game is, you have 3 separate piles of cards before you. All the cards in each pile is stacked in a way that you get to see all the text on every single cards. 

Now when you take a card action (just follow what the text says) from the top card, from one of the three piles, you'll take the card and put it all the way behind the pile. As you take card actions and again put them at the back, this will create a rotation. Think of it like a queue, the front card is ready to be activated, white the rest of the cards in line are waiting to be activated in sequence. When the front card is activated, it is moved to the back of the line, and the next card in line is ready to be activated.

The deck/pool building is simply taking new cards and putting it into the queue. The longer your line is, the less efficient your actions will be. 

I like that there are plenty of commodities used in the game.

Only available in German. Hopefully a new English edition will be released soon!

(Rating based on 30+ asynch online plays on Yucata.de [microbadge=19345])

Maybe I'm not seeing what I'm supposed to see, but this game feels very random in what cards you get, especially early on.

There are not many cards that let you remove cards from your piles. As a matter of fact, there's only one that does so consistently. So if you can get one, you can trim your piles down to one card each and just play those cards over and over. Oddly enough, even though that lets you win, it's not very exciting to play because you just go through the same motions over and over.

If you don't manage to do that, you'll end up with stacks of which most cards you don't even want to play. And while there are cards that work well together, I never felt like I had a real combo going. That's because you'll never play more than one card per turn.

I like the basic idea of having three stacks of cards that you can play through. But what I'm missing is a way to swap cards, more ways to remove cards, and mostly a way to chain cards together to form combos.

It's a real shame this game is not more widely available because it is wonderful. It works kind of like a deck-builder yet with more control over your deck and with 3 decks simultaneously.

It all works fantastically and plays very smooth and quick. It feels like a race as you try to reach 25 points first by building your engine fastest. Reminds me of games like Race for the Galaxy and Tournay.

A pretty cool card game with very short and easy rules. There is some luck involved, but it's mostly about using and setting up your actions. The luck of the draw is there, but if you aren't greedy and use your actions wisely, it doesn't have a big impact.

However, the game doesn't offer much interaction, but comes with a set of cards that add some interaction to it. With that said, it's more about planning and caring about your own caravans. It plays somewhat slow (turns go fast though!), as it takes time to get everything rolling, but it's still a nice game in my eyes.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (April 2017)

Kashgar: Händler der Seidenstraße is a neat and novel deck building game. Before playing it, I didn’t have a clue about what the game was about, but I enjoyed it.

The rules aren’t hard, you can explain then under 4 minutes. Playtime is less than an hour.

The art is ok to good. The theme doesn’t do anything for me, but some mechanisms support it during the game.

The decisions needed to play the game are interesting. You have 3 decks at all times (an innovation) and in each one of your turns you can only play the bottom card of any of your caravans (decks). All the cards are face up all the time so you can plan ahead. You then must decide if you play the caravan action (keeping the card and putting it in the back of the caravan) or the parting action (eliminating the card from your deck). You can also pass.

I’m worried about the luck factor. Right from the setup, players have different cards and the luck of the draw seems uncontrollable, so it seems luck can decide a lot. I need more plays to verify this point.  	

It’s a shame it´s only available in German.

As most deckbuilding games, it is best played with 2 players.

Bottom line, Kashgar: Händler der Seidenstraße is a novel deckbuilding game and I like it. I’m worried about the luck factor, it seems uncontrollable and that’s a shame. For now, I want to explore the game further.

RATING: 7
Kashgar is a kind of a deckbuilding game where players build three decks at once which remain open and in a fixed order. Each deck forms a caravan. The cards in the caravan mostly provide additional resources, allow drafting new cards or fulfilling orders which are the main VP source.
The game has three potential weaknesses: multiplayer solitaire, randomness and a potentially too powerful strategy. I don't mind the lack of interaction. The randomness wasn't a problem so far but some games might be spoiled for a player if he doesn't get any merchants allowing order fulfillment. Most serious, the reportedly very powerful single merchant caravan strategy turned up in our game and was a winning strategy. The author already chimed in to the discussion that it's beatable. Hopefully, it's true as I had fun with Kashgar which is not my standard for deckbuilders.

Szerintem ez egy kiváló játék, és ha eddig nem csak németül lett volna kapható, akkor valószínűleg nagy siker lett volna. Így sajna a nyelvfüggősége miatt háttérbe szorult. Érdekesség, hogy Gerhard Hecht az itt használt mechanikát több játékába is átmentette, de valahogy mindegyik csak németül jelent meg. Kár érte, szerintem kiváló ötlet, nagyon elegáns ez a fajta "pakliépítés". Most ha jól láttam, a Kashgar angolul is elérhető, de attól tartok, hogy egy kicsit késő már, mert a mai környezetben annyira nem friss érzetű, nagyon mechanikus az egész. Én jó szívvel ajánlom, de csak azoknak, akik szeretik az olyan kártyás euró játékokat, ahol gyakorlatilag állandó átváltás van a különböző nyersanyagok között, tematika meg nuku. :)

Curious to explore this one more.  Initial impressions are pretty positive as I feel like there is definitely a fair bit of space to explore in card combos/strategies.  There is randomness in luck of the draw, but the open deckbuilding aspect is an interesting mechanism to explore.  I also appreciate that some cards have the opportunity to take a special action and then trash the card once you've deemed it is useless for the future.  This is fairly light and quick.  

Be aware that at this time, there is no English language version.  This game is heavily text dependent and requires paste-ups for the cards.

Deck building, done differently. You actually have 3 decks (to start, can be more during the game), and the decks are open. Very interesting variation of Dominion like games. 

Only downside, like with most deck building games, it's a solitaire game. There is almost no interaction. There are some cards to annoy others, but most of the time, you are playing with your own deck. You can execute an assignment before someone else's nose, but what's the fun of that?

All in all, an enjoyable game that comes best to its right, I think, with few players, preferably 2, so that downtime doesn't get too high. 

Is there a theme? Didn't notice it.

Pleasant card game of doing an action written on the card, then moving the card to the back of the row. Three rows/caravans for each player, so enough choices. Open deckbuilder. A bit solitary, the expansion cards added make the game slightly more interactive.

A truly original take on the deck builder concept. 

I haven’t yet tried the advanced cards, but with the basic cards it is true that the player interaction is pretty low.But from the simple (but novel) game concept and rules, the card powers are pretty interesting. 

I want to play this much more, it’s really good.

Es macht definitiv Spaß, auch wenn mir als Deckbauspiel Dominion besser gefällt. Es ist vielschichtiger und kniffliger als die ersten Partien erwarten lässt. Bin mal gespannt wie lange der Spielreiz anhält.
Was aber definitiv in jede Partie gehört ist eine übersichtliche Zählleiste, an der stets der aktuelle Spielstand abgelesen werden kann. Hier muss nachgebessert werden! (Bei Claudio im Heldenseminar gewonnen!)

A queue builder game where you have can trigger the power from one of the cards in front of your caravan before moving it to the back. Some cards, like the Patriach let you gain other cards to add to the back of your caravan. I found it really tedious and frustrating. It's just queue-optimization, where you're trying to gain goods to cover contracts. But if you can't even fulfill a contract without the fulfill contract power. The patriach let's you choose from two drawn cards so there's a good chance you won't even get a card that helps you and when you get a card that doesn't help you it hurts you as it just makes your caravan longer. Seems like a game that with a few plays under your belt is just going to come out to optimal tactical strategies.

Played a few times on Yucata--it's a solid resource-collection/hand-management game (3 queues of cards which you cycle through and build/thin). Trying to manage the cards is interesting (figuring out how to make an efficient loop) but the resource-collection/contract-fulfilling side of the game is duller.

RATING: 7
In this deck building game, each player starts with three caravans. During your turn you will play a card from the bottom of a caravan, then the card goes to the top of the caravan and cannot be played again until all the cards below it have been played. You play cards to gain goods, fulfill contracts or manipulate cards in your deck. 

It's a fun game, and rating will rise with more plays. I like how you have to build your decks and adapt to the contracts. Looking forward to more plays.

Interesting engine game. I heard this was in development before Dominion? Its unfortunate the designer couldn't get this out sooner, as the engine and card-building aspect both remind me of Dominion in many ways. The only thing is that this doesn't need shuffling. Though in exchange, its a bit less interesting and less replayable I think.

Only for the committed, playing this in English will require paste-ups or printing custom cards.

It's probably worth the effort, though, as this is a unique deck building game in which efficiency is key (it's a race game, after all). Card powers interact in interesting ways, and turns are as quick as they can be. Refreshing, and likely to appeal even to those who feel burned out on deckbuilding in general.

I thought this one was pretty innovative, as it uses deckbuilding elements in a new way. Instead of adding cards to your deck, you're adding them to three face-up piles in front of you. Each turn, you can use the top card of any pile, and then move it to the back, so you have to go through the cards in your pile in order. Each pile starts with a Patriarch, who forces you to add a card, but through clever play you can manage the size of your piles so that you can use specific cards more often. This is built on top of a fairly standard order-fulfillment mechanism, where you accumulate various goods and cash them in for contracts worth points. Unfortunately, the game hasn't been picked up by a company in the English-speaking world, and there was a ton of German text to cheatsheet through.

How good can you make a game that plays very smoothly  with so little rules? The answer is: Kashgar! Incomprehensible that no other publishing company sees the quality of this game and is willing to make an edition in his language: Come on ZMan, WGG, 999 Games,... this will do excellent! It's strongly language dependant, so most people would like to have this in their mother language

Deck building card game. You have all card in play at all times but it is still a critical hand management and deck builder. Trying to score the points from completing contracts and points on cards. It is a nice game. A lot of text and getting used to how the game flow works but it is a nice game. I would definitely play it again. The "mean cards" are quite mean and there are rules to not play with them which I would advise in the first few plays. Interesting game.

I like the card stacking mechanism a great deal. Acquire regular cards with a bit of a choice using your Patriarch, or invest an extra turn to fish in the discards. Acquire special cards, or not. Build up your resources, get a contract buyer poised to buy, thin one of your caravans for contracts while fattening up another for resources. All good stuff.

Unfortunately the rest of the game simply involves cashing in goods for contracts and leaves me cold.

Take the three card deck mechanism and build a better game around it. I'll buy it.

Played once with 4P. This simple card game uses an innovative variation of the deckbuilding mechanism. Players have 3 columns of cards, and get to activate one of the frontmost cards of either column per turn. Once activated, that card moves to the back of the column.

Kashgar is really quite a multiplayer solitaire type of game, proven by the fact that players are able to take turns out of order with little consequence. But it plays quickly and I have an idiosyncratic fondness for games which reward efficient deckbuilding. It does appear that luck of the draw has quite an influence over well you do though, as one player failed to draw cards which provide donkeys early on and it resulted in him trailing behind in VP.

The game is "broken". There is a certain strategy that would let you finish in no time, opponent has no chance to catch up if he doesn't follow this same strategy immediately. Also there is absolutely no interaction with the other players. Needs some rule adaption and an expansion which lets you interact more.

After several more plays: knocking this down to a 7 -- seems the best thing to do is to get one caravan down to contract-fulfillers only. If you can't do that (by not lucking into the right draws), it's very difficult be competitive. For me, at least. 

2 plays

This is another one of those deck construction type of games, with a twist. Here, you get 3 caravans made of 3 set cards (Patriarchs) and 3 random start cards. All cards do various things like give you resources (tracked on a player board: 5 kinds of spice; gold, and mules), draft cards, fulfill contracts (4 face up; worth VP; cost various combinations of resources). They may require you to pay some resources to activate. When you acquire cards, you add it to the back of the caravan -- so as you get more cards, it'll take longer to cycle through your "deck" to get them, but the cards are always in the same order. Some cards are worth VP, too.

The game moves pretty quickly as you try to build some kind of engine to acquire resources and buy cards/contracts. The first player to get to 25VP wins!

This was a very enjoyable deck builder (of sorts)! It would be even better if the text-heavy cards were in English!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Players each start with 3 caravans (columns of cards), each with a Patriarch and a random start card. On your turn, take the action of the card at the front of one of your columns, moving that card to the back. These actions may give you resources (tracked on a personal board: 0-9 spices or gold, 0-6 donkeys), convert resources into others, gain additional cards to add to your caravan, remove cards from game, spend resources to complete one of the contracts on display (immediately replenished), etc. Some cards, and all contracts, are worth VP; the game ends at the end of a round when at least one player has at least 25 VP. The player with the most VP wins!

Now here's a deck building game that does things differently. You build 3 decks. And all the cards in the deck are face up. And you don't draw and reshuffle but simply chose the top card in one deck, execute the action and move it to the bottom of the deck. Quite unique and it brings with it nice strategic and tactical choices. You can optimize one deck to be very good at generating resources and optimizing an other one for fulfilling orders for instance. Or combine multiple things in one big deck. And all of this plays in about 45 to 60 minutes. Very cool.
I don't get why other publishers are not looking into localizing this game. It has lots of German text on the cards (which for us is manageable) and an English version would do well, I think.

After a few games still not sure about how much luck vs. skill the game has. Obtaining certain cards early or in short caravans is so much better than later or in a long caravan. 

Plays quick, is not vey deep (which can be a good thing) and it looks nice with the player boards and spice tokens. They could have used cubes, but since they are small wooden bags and gold nuggets and donkeys, you call them "pepper" or "cinnamon" instead of "black" and "red". Does not make it a thematic game, but adds a little bit to the (thin) theme.

Now this one's your poster child for a multiplayer solitaire, where everyone pays attention to his own plans and his own turns whereas you let others do as they please. Which is - keeping the attention to your plans alone - boring enough by itself. The horrors if you had to read or listen to what the others had just "built" or "rearranged"

Very interesting take on a deck builder mechanic with open "decks" to build engines with. I especially like that you have multiple decks and engines you can specialize for different things. My wife likes that the actions of members of your caravans actually make sense, with regard to their character. It is very easy to grasp wether a character will be useful to your current tableau or not. Right on the second play she could do her own strategizing.

To be honest, I only have this because we visited Kashgar and had such a wonderful time there. The game itself is a fairly standard euro and does not have any Kashgarian flavour - not even in its Eurocentric artwork. I prefer games with more interaction than this where it's minimal. It does, however, have a very interesting mechanism where you run three open decks that each work as a separate deck builder.

With English cards.

We are Caravan Traders over silk road in a race to fill contracts of spices using gold and donkeys in an evolved deck builder variant. The first game I have seen where each player manages not one deck but three. And, not only that but you play them open face up, splayed showing all cards of each deck, played first in first out. So many strategy decisions as you manage your three caravan decks. It's like 3-D chess in a deck builder. Creative card abilities that interplay between your caravan decks and interact to screw your neighbor.

Classic case of one game too many for me but it's a highly rated deck builder without shuffling, which was beginning to hack me right off. The big sell here is its euro-style resource tracks, Brugge-like character art and unique character powers that cycle cards through one of 2/3/4 caravans. Can use card power at front of caravan only, many of which have single use super power or lesser reusable power.Need a-z chr trans to hand but icons will soon be learned.

This game is available on Yucata for a long time, but it didn't draw my attention after reading its rules. Until recently i've heard someone on internet praising it. So i've decided to give it a try. I have to admit that its mechanism is indeed unique (deck building 3 or more decks). But the gameplay is not exciting. It's just boring and too prolonged. Although i've only played it on Yucata with two players and some of my opponents were living on Yucata and doing 10 or more turns per day, sessions of this game were still lasting for too long. First, its uniqueness (3 or more deck building and playing) just irritates. You constantly have to try to remember which card is where and with what card it has to play, you have to check all your decks to remember what you were trying to do with each. Of course, playing it live, on a sufficiently large table would allow to spread cards to be able to see them all. On Yucata you only see actions of two first cards in a deck and then you have to click on every other card, because it is hard to tell from the name itself. Of course, on Yucata this is like that to save the screen space, although it can be improved as you don't really care for your opponent. Then the way of adding the cards to the decks. You deck is growing and you see the cards you need less and less often. There are ways to trim the decks, but then we face another annoying aspect of this game. Many cards are worth points at the end of the game. So if you remove them, you lose points. Yes, this is a search for balance between good cards, sacrificing these good cards to get more resources and complete better contracts. But it doesn't feel rewarding. It's just stale and very slow pacing. Feels more like a very painful and slow crawling.

We’ve seen this game in stores everywhere in the week before Spiel 2013. And by looking at it, we didn’t became that interested in it. In January we got the opportunity to play this game. As to us it seemed that it just has survived Spiel and didn’t make any impression to anybody, we didn’t expect too much of it. And just like it happens sometimes, it happened also this time. The game surprised us. Nice, original deck-building (which is open on the table) game. Some nice components. Disadvantage is the huge amounts of text that are on the cards. You’ll need to know the German language, otherwise the game is unplayable. Also the downtime in the game is pretty big. Therefore I wouldn’t recommend to play it with more then two players. Also this is a game that just needs an expansion, which adds some conflicts to the game. Things are just too sweet and nice know, and the history learned us, that traders in the past weren’t nice at all. They were mean and sneaky. That’s something we miss in the game. If there would be an expansion that would add that to the game, then there would also be more interaction within the game, and would make it more interesting to play it with more then two players.

First impression, playing with German cards.  I suspect that being familiar with the cards would raise this to a [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b].  I like this face-up queuebuilding innovation.  The central decks from which everyone works greatly limit strategic planning, so you just try to keep your queues chugging along as an effective, nimble engine.

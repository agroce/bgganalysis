Uma versão do Pandemic ambientada no universo de Lovecraft e seus anciões. Como existem algumas regras novas, preciso jogar rápido para formar uma opinião.

A grande diferença são as miniaturas dos investigadores e dos cultistas/adoradores e dos Shoggoths. Só isso já dá uma identidade visual bem mais legal que o Pandemic original.

Cópia adquirida em parceria com a Bravo Jogos!

Update: o jogo acabou se provando mais difícil do que o Pandemic tradicional. Você tem que encarar o capiroto das profundezas por conta das cartas, andas ativações dos Shoggoths e das invocações dos cultistas/adoradores!

Gostei bastante!

RATING: 6
This game is good because Pandemic is fundamentally good, but its new mechanisms (sanity and gates) are not significantly better than those in Pandemic itself. Plus the board is super dark and the artwork, while nice, becomes completely invisible as soon as the super distracting bright teal coloured miniatures are placed down.

I do however, like the Shuggoth (moving epidemic) rules very much.

The Pandemic gameplay and Cthulhu theme are well suited to each other.  There are a few differences between this game and Pandemic such as Shoggoths moving towards the gates, Old Ones awakening and having adverse effects across the board, relic cards for players to use, Sanity die and tolkens, etc. to warrant purchasing this game.  The miniatures, board and artwork are well done.

While I enjoy Pandemic and am a big fan of Lovecraft and the Cthulhu mythos, this combination just doesn't do it for me. Really easy to get into and play, just like the standard version of Pandemic and the random Great Old Ones means that things can play out a little differently each time which is neat. The board tries to evoke doom and gloom in the artwork but the board is far too dark to see anything well enough for that feeling to really come through. An interesting experiment but it's just not for me.

Pandemic Reign of Cthulhu has cool components and has the same easy, simple rules as standard Pandemic. However, the ways in which this game can turn on you are far too much. In Pandemic, outbreaks can chain but unless you let it get totally out of control they cannot tear through the board and cause your defeat. Because there is only one way for the outbreaks to occur. But in Reign of Cthulhu there are so many things that can happen to cause the game to just rip into you. Like disease cubes , cultists can overrun which causes an Awakening of an Elder God. But that Elder God can put more cultists out, which can in turn cause another Awakening. Plus you have shuggoths  moving through gates and  once a shuggoth goes through a gate that causes an Awakening. Then there are the Evil Stirs which are the equivalent of Epidemic cards. Those cause an Awakening. And these things can easily chain together. In one game we had four Awakenings occur in one player's turn. You only have to have seven to lose. So we were half way to losing in one turn! One! Yes. we  know that coop games are meant to be challenging. But when you can be brought that close to defeat in one turn (did I mention that was the first turn in the game?) it is too hard.

Thematically more up my alley than regular Pandemic. Seems easier to beat, though I have lost. Good game...always has been and the monster theme is a fix for me.

It's just another variant of Pandemic, but with one caveat- it's absolutely perfect for two players. Personally, I feel like the standard game plays best at three to four. 

Good game overall, but the component quality is something less than it could be.

RATING: 5.5
Unlike prior Pandemics -- which were exercises in evaluating probabilities and pressing your luck -- this game is simply a luck-fest.  Yes, it has nice/decent components, and yes it has thematic art and gameplay, but these simply can't offset the enormous swingy-ness of the player card draws and bosses.  Bleh.

I won't turn down a game if someone else suggests it, but I won't be the one suggesting to play it.  And I LOVE Pandemic.

RATING: 8.8
Really great new iteration of Cthulhu, the changes and nuances are all thematic and in fact I prefer this over vanilla Pandemic. I love the addition of the Sanity die, the various movement options, the Relics and how the Cultists and Shoggoths can move or summon to flip Old Ones cards faster. But at it's heart, you'll recognize the pure Pandemic gameplay.

RATING: 7
A variant of Pandemic based on Cthulhu mythos, where characters can turn mad? I am interested!

In Reign of Cthulhu there are lots of similarities with Pandemic, but gameplay feels somewhat different enough to present an interesting challenge.

One thing I like is the die-roll for insanity: I don't enjoy alea in strategic competitive games, but in a cooperative like this, the die injects a bit of welcome uncertainty.

What I don't find so great is the swinginess of the Ancient cards: some games feel very hard when the first cards have permanent negative powers, while others could be much easier if the first Ancients are more forgiving.

On the other hand, I am not yet sure if I like the easiness of trading clue cards (unlike regular Pandemic, those are not tied to single cities, but to macro-areas). I've only played at the expert level thus far, and I felt sealing the gates was a very reachable goal, even when playing sub-optimally the first few games.

Anyway, Pandemic Reign of Cthulhu is an enjoyable game, and I would like to explore it for another bunch of games.

I've always considered the original Pandemic to simply be an OK game. Pandemic Cthulhu is the saving grace for me. The board and miniature colors are gorgeous! The card art is amazing. It's straight forward yet just as; if not more difficult than the original. I can't say enough good stuff about this game. The only reason the score is not higher is due to the difficulty of the game. Can frustrate you sometimes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.1
New to this game and I don't like the classic Pandemic, but this one is a good replacement as I love the HP Lovecraft theme and games.

The die brings in luck and the sessions are short and tense. I think this may replace Defenders of the Realm which is great but a little too long and more dice dependant.

At50% price reduction a nice surprise.

UPDATE

After 5 more plays, I upped the rating !
Actually it is a great little game with extreme fun within a very good thematic game with great Art. I love it. 9.1 just because it is so much fun AND thematic.
I keep playing it and despite the fact I want to play other games in my planning, it sits in my head... begged to be played more.

The main weakness of Pandemic is its theme: let’s say it, who really cares anything for curing diseases, however undeadly they are?
Otherwise it would be a fine simple game with a solid basic mechanism that works smoothly, like better-themed games such as Defenders of the Realm and Forbidden Island show: all Pandemic needed to become a good game (or at least one you don’t feel ashamed of playing) was theme.
A good theme.
A theme you would really care something for.

Enter Cthulhu.

Despite being one of the most abused themes of the last decade (not as much as zombies though and still more fashionable), Lovecraft’s inspiration adds all the greatness of the pulps with the appeal of a classier, more stylish and educated era: and, hey, it’s even royalty-free!

Now Pandulhu has all you may wish for in a little cooperative game that takes less than an hour to play, can be grasped by newbies (and non-gamers as well!) quickly and has way more than just a pinch of a good theme.
The core mechanisms are the same as your regular Pandemic but they have been slightly modified to better fit the theme: there aren’t overruns anymore but Shoggoths spawing now and then in their place, which matches the new theme like cheese on macaroni, like a cheap Italian saying goes (for the uninitiated, it means they feel like they complement each other).
Three female characters in a cast of seven available are somehow too many for a game set in the Twenties (and even more so since one of them is a huntress: of baddies, that is) but this is what today’s entertainment industry expects, or rather requires, from any game, so let’s cherish they didn’t go heavier on this.

Anyhow, this is nitpicking: Pandulhu is a fine game on its own whose fitting theme and good components, though not top-notch, help improve the experience even further.

I LOVE this game. Pandemic is a favorite game, but adding a cthulhu theme makes it even better. ALWAYS happy to fetch this one off the shelf! The theme work is well done, with gorgeous artwork, and high quality components; even the rulebook is dripping with artwork, and also easy tor ead and follow. The game is very straightforward, but with the same brutal randomness that fills other Cthulhu themed games. It's easy for things to suddenly take a turn for the worse, with Shoggoth's jumping through gateways and awakening Old Ones, which triggers all sorts of nasty effects. It very much captures the feel and difficulty of Cthulhu games, and the theme works very well for Pandemic. It does play a bit differently- the movement around the board is a bit different, and each character has unique abilities. Overall it's a great version of Pandemic, though I feel it can be a bit tougher than the others because of the Shoggoths and the variable Old One powers that can appear as you play. All around great game for Pandemic fans, or fans of other Cthulhu games like Mansions of Madness or Eldritch Horror.

Whatever, it's Pandemic. As much as I love the Lovecraft theme, the changes to the game are so small that this is really redundant if you already own Pandemic (especially with its expansions). 

It's cool that the map is restricted (i.e. doesn't wrap), but the limitations for movement are easily made up for by having all cards of each region be exactly the same (thus making it much easier to bus around the board). The Great Old Ones add a nice rule change which makes the game significantly harder as you get closer to losing. I'd love to see something like this mechanic implemented in an expansion to the regular game.

Fewer locations and more turns between intensification reshuffles means all games feel more or less the same. We went through almost all of the summoning deck in every single game. The sanity die and the old ones awakening events add more randomness than I like.

I enjoyed this, but the only real reasons to play it instead of Pandemic are: 1) it's simpler & a little faster; 2) it's got nice minis; 3) it's Cthulhu. I can see this being a totally fun interlude for your Trail of Cthulhu or other RPG group or other various folks who are members of the geek-o-sphere but not really hobbyist boardgamers. I enjoy it as a change of pace. As a piece of game design work, though, it doesn't have much on Pandemic itself, and for a change of pace from Pandemic you'd probably want Pandemic Iberia, On the Brink, or Legacy, all of which are much more solid just as game designs.

Based on 1 play with 3 players:

Okay yeah I'm a fangirl so sue me. I just had to know for myself whether or not this was actually a good twist on Pandemic or a craptacular cash grab - and the answer is somewhere in the middle. It is by no means a bad game. The art is actually really lovely and I honestly think the theme works well (even if, coming from Pandemic, it's pretty apparent that it's pasted on). This is nowhere near my favorite twist on Pandemic, but it has just enough new wrinkles to justify its own existence... but [i]only just.[/i]

Nice, quick, fun game that gives you the flavour of something like Arkham Horror or Eldritch Horror in half (?) the time. Fans of both those games will probably say "no depth!" Which is probably true, but there's enough chrome to give you that whole Lovecraftian, Cthulhu-ish ambience with none of the cruft.

Only rant: when oh when will games publishers realise gamers like to sleeve their cards? It's not much use making a very nice insert for the game... when sleeved cards won't fit inside!

Basically take that formula, but the disease cubes are cultists, the town cards are tied to 4 major areas with no specific sub-areas listed (easier to trade as a result) and instead of outbreaks you advance the game end doom clock with said clock also making the game a bit harder in some way. The special cards are replaced by Relics, which are generally awesome, but carry the distinct danger of driving your player insane (this is not as bad as it sounds and is moderately reasonable to recover from). The only other major mechanic is the Shoggoths, which are basically big bads that require more actions to remove from the board, if they are left out for very long they can advance the end game clock quickly as well.

Despite all of the stuff above, the theme works, and the game is in most ways easier to grok and play than normal Pandemic. I picked it up as an option for some light couples gaming, and it should work well in that regard. Gamers should probably stick to normal Pandemic or, even better, Legacy, but I love Cthulhu themed stuff and this one definitely works well enough. Ideal for an evening with drinks and friends though, so can't complain there!

I own regular Pandemic and have played it a bunch. I bought this because of the Cthulu/Lovecraft theme and I am so happy I did. There's enough mechanics that are different to warrant owning this alongside vanilla Pandemic. The artwork is outstanding. The relics, Old ones and the board especially stand out as just a pleasure to look at and really make you feel as if you're stopping old ones instead of diseases. That said, the main gameplay loop is almost identical, but the extra challenging stuff thrown in is a lot of fun. Highly recommend. If you're a fan of Pandemic and Lovecraft, this is a must own.

It's no Pandemic. This version is a lite version, easier and quicker to play and with some different mechanisms to keep things a little fresher for a nice change. Veteran Pandemic players will find it too easy, this version is more geared towards the casual player and is excellent if that is what you like.

Played it and i can safely say it's the worst pandemic game that i have played. Worse than the 2 spin off games. The game seems harder and i'm glad it's isn't just a retheme but i bounced off this. It's sad too because i enjoy H.P Lovecraft and was looking forward to this.

This game actually feels different for the original pandemic while retaining some of the series' major mechanisms. I actually find the Cthulhu mythos to be quite entertaining despite its saturation in the gaming world. I also like the variety of elder gods that are present in every game. My only complaint is that this game seems too easy sometimes. I actually ended up winning my first two plays on hard mode.

This is such an epic take on the Pandemic style of gameplay - but really it's its own game. You have to go into it with a new set of rules and all that and it's epic.

I really wanted to like this, but found it quite uninspired.  We played it a few times, and have zero desire to go back.  Maybe it was too easy?  Not different enough?  Not sure.

The extra Cthulhu stuff was a mix between cool-but-not-Earth-shattering (like the rarely used insanity effects) and the nonsensical (like just walking around town kicking tiny cultists).

It looks like I bet on the wrong horse for a Pandemic spinoff, comparing this to Iberia (which I did not try).

I have won both times I played. But the other players have said that they routinely lose. In both my wins it was close. The Cthulhu theme is well integrated to the game and i enjoyed playing the game both times. I am debating if I want this as I have Pandemic and its expansions. If I get it it will only be because other people may enjoy the theme more not because I feel I need it.

Pandemic in Lovecraft's world of Cthulhu. Instead of containing viruses you try and fight the reign of Cthulhu across the country. Cooperative game in which each player plays a specific character (the hunter, the driver,...). The team has to collect cards to close the gates of hell, fighting off the enemies on the map and the Elders (cards which are revealed as the game progresses and influence the game by changing the rules).

Great fun, a tense, atmospheric race against time as the deck of cards runs down and the Old Ones awaken. We took it to a seaside holiday cottage and it worked perfectly with gamers and non gamers to the extent that on the Sunday night one of us sat up playing it solo with the fire flickering in the grate and a bottle of whisky to hand after everyone else went to bed. He survived with his sanity intact but it may have been a close run thing...

The sanity die is a big step backward from a design perspective. Unlike in VanillaP, the best choice is often to pass actions, particularly when insane. This is pretty lame.

A re-skin of classic Pandemic. 

The new challenge is the slimy giant shuggoth monsters that increases the doom/outbreak track when they reach one of the gates.

The simplification is that the clue cards (needed to complete the 4 "close gate" tasks) are generic. So: no more tightly-calculated turns trying to meet up in Lagos in order to give someone the Lagos card. 

In our initial playing the shuggoths either hosed us very quickly, or we too-easily swapped clues and closed the gates with time to spare. The game works, it evokes Pandemic, but lacks the near-miss tension of its progenitor.

RATING: 6
Not a bad game, but it does not have the narrative that the other Pandemic games have.  In the other versions there is a building tension, in this game you go from being fine to losing in one players turn and the theme is pasted on.  I would rather play regular Pandemic or Forbidden Island any time.

MPlayed  for the first time this weekend (10/29) with 13 yo son. Very much enjoyed our session — not too difficult to learn, great cooperation and teamwork encouragement. We lost because we ran out of Player Cards, although we had managed to seal three gates, and were one turn/lucky card draw away from sealing the fourth. Just like Pandemic, this well-designed and balanced game has a knack for creating Edge-of-your-seat finale moments, which means that even when you lose (which is often for us), you still end up having a great time!

RATING: 8
Played original and legacy Pandemic.
You sort of got to have a copy of Pandemic of your own, so if like me you never got round to that until now, I prefer this version over the original.  Presentation is excellent, play is near enough to original to be easy to play, but different enough to provide fun for old hat Pandemic players.  It seems harder than original (though that may be just because our group played the original enough times to 'master' it).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
What this game proves is that at its core Pandemic is a solid and adaptable system. My gut reaction to the game at this point though is that Pandemic is smoother of an experience. Cthulhu is swingy and I feel what GOOs are drawn and what characters are used determines more the difficulty than the actual difficulty levels in the game. A few unfortunate card flips and things can quickly snowball. That said though, it is fun, like most co-ops for me, I play more as a solo experience and this is one that I plan on bringing out to show the wife, but really it won't be a packed for game days. Solid, not great, but fun enough to hold onto.

RATING: 7
This is like Pandemic, but has a little more of an Ameritrash sort of feel for a few reasons:

-Plastic minis
-Dice-rolling
-Cthulhu theme
-Theme is more integrated to the mechanisms

This has a Pandemic feel, but strays further from Pandemic than something like Pandemic Iberia. I say this because there is only one kind of 'disease' on the board, which are the cultists. Also, 'outbreak' serves a different function in this game. When you would have an outbreak, you flip an Old One card. These will have an immediate or ongoing hindrance and acts as a timer for the end of the game. You also have Shoggosths which are horrific monsters that take 3 actions to defeat. You will want to do so because they provide a random 'event' card that wasn't added to the player deck during setup, if they enter a gate an Old One card will flip, and there are only 3 in the supply. Having to put a 4th on the board means an instant loss. The game also feels like it's a bit quicker than traditional Pandemic.

I really like the artwork in this game. I don't like the unpainted gray character miniatures. Colour differentiation would have been appreciated, but replacing these with pawn/meeples is easy enough. The cultist and Shoggoth miniatures are fine imo. It's nice that it feels like it has a bit more replay value than base Pandemic. I say this because there are more roles, more 'events,' and different old ones each game. That said, while there are more 'event' cards included than base Pandemic, it doesn't seem like huge variability because you see more of them throughout the game via killing Shoggoths than you would in a traditional Pandemic game.

Not everything works perfectly though. I don't really like how one of the end game triggers is linked to reaching the end of the Old One cards. One: it should have been Azathoth rather than Cthulhu that causes instant loss. Two: each 'epidemic card' makes you flip one of these Old One cards... if you have had bad luck in the beginning (ie from 'outbreaks' and Shoggoths entering gates), you may realize that, based on the number of 'epidemic' cards left in the deck, you've already lost. This makes for a very anticlimactic ending, rather than how base Pandemic ratchets up the tension. 

Basically, this is a good game with a few weird design choices that make you go 'hmmmmm.' 

Pandemic Product Comparisons:

I could definitely see people preferring this to base Pandemic. I could also see Pandemic fans owning both games, but I think Iberia is better. I definitely prefer the art and theme of this game over the base game. I can't see myself keeping this one long-term, unless it comes out with an expansion. If you aren't going to buy the original pandemic + expansion(s), I think Iberia is a more worthy purchase than Reign of Cthulhu. I say this because the roles and events in Iberia seem more differentiated than the original Pandemic than what you find in Reign of Cthulhu. In addition, Iberia comes with two variants to change up the gameplay. I think I'd still rather own Pandemic + it's 3 expansions for the sheer variety of what you get. 

Includes:

07 Roles (crossover with base game)
12 Artifacts (Events)

This is a fun twist on Pandemic which simplifies some parts, while adding some cool new additions.

Rules are similar enough to Pandemic that those familiar with them will pick up quickly. Changes to the rules fit the theme, keeping co-op play stressful (but less, as no "chain reaction outbreaks") and fun. Less pieces make it a little better for bringing to conventions and other places.

Everyone in my group seems to prefer this version now, but we haven't played Iberia yet. It's worth noting I live in the area a lot of Lovecraft's stories were based on.

Surprisingly close to the original pandemic with a new theme and a bit of a spin on a couple of mechanics.:goo:

There are a lot less cards in the deck and a lot less cultists (cubes) to place therefore this is a tighter game where you can hit the game over conditions relatively quickly. Indeed in the very first game I didn't even get a second turn before it all went horribly wrong :soblue:

I am not sure really what to think of it... honestly.... I think I prefer original pandemic to this one as it feels more co-op, I love the planning that goes into meeting in a city to swap over a single card, which is the one mechanic that has really been pared down and practically stripped out in this version

See, I'm not a fan of regular Pandemic. Reign of Cthulhu manages to streamline several game play aspects, resulting in shorter setup and shorter play time, but without sacrificing what makes Pandemic a worthwhile game. Overall, I find Reign of Cthulhu a much more enjoyable experience, the same way I prefer The Cure over basic Pandemic.

The theme and mechanics come together very well in this game!

No, not this again. A hate-ratings of 1 aren't cool. But multiple counterratings of 10 (in reaction to a single 1) is even worse.

I'm really tired of people counterrating, and I'm sure I'm not alone.

All these fanbois with their irrational ratings are the reason BGG ratings mean less and less.

Sharing cards to save the world from monsters. The Cthulu theme does not appeal to me. Often the end comes very suddenly. On your turn, everything still seems fine. But then everything escalates very quickly and before you can do anything the game is over. Some people might like that, but for me it feels frustrating and too sudden since it does not follow the classical `arc of suspense'.

The gameplay is also not intriguing. It's just randomly getting cards and meeting others to share them. Wonder if I would like regular Pandemic more...

Similar to the original pandemic, but with some changes that make it worth playing. The art is great, it really captures the spirit of Lovecraft work's. The first two times we played we lost very quickly; we soon realised that some strategies that work well in the original or Iberia should be avoided in Reign of Cthulhu.

RATING: 8
A more thematically interesting version of "Pandemic". With awakenings of the Great Old Ones replacing outbreaks, and a more lenient rule for trading cards, it's also easier (sometimes even a bit too easy), albeit the difficulty can be very dependent on luck of the draw. The shoggoths - wandering monsters that are harder to kill and can also cause awakenings - are a good addition. And following the tradition of the Lovecraftian themes, you can lose your sanity, of course. In the end, the truth is that I enjoy this game much more than the original.

On the production, the plastic miniatures are very nice, although the disproportionately big investigators make their enemies look less menacing. The board should be larger, as a single investigator or shoggoth is enough to fill up a space.

Újabb csáposbőr
Már vártam, hogy kipróbálhassam a játékot, hiszen egyik kedvenc játékom, a Pandemic találkozik benne kedvelt szerzőm (Lovecraft) által teremtett világgal.
Vírusok helyett kultisták lepik el a tetszetős (bár túl sötét) játéktáblát (az egész világ helyett csak Észak-Amerika 4 városát), valamint pár szörnyike is szabadon kószál. A játékosok egy-egy szereplő bőrébe bújva (természetesen a jól megszokott módon minden szereplőnek különböző speciális képessége is van) akciókat hajtanak végre, amelyek során kultistákat űznek el, szörnyeket pusztítanak, mozognak, kaput zárnak be, ereklyéket használnak ésatöbbi…
Majd 2 lapot húznak reszkető kézzel, nehogy az egyik Vén feltámadjon tovább nehezítve a játékot. Végül pedig újabb kultisták érkeznek és a szörnyek mozognak. Ha túl sok kultista van egy helyen, megidéznek egy újabb Vént, valamint a kapura mozgó szörnyek is.
A játékosoknak egy esélye van megnyerni az egyenlőtlen küzdelmet, 5 azonos színű lap felhasználásával az adott színhez tartozó kaput be kell zárnia (összesen 4 ilyen kaput kell bezárni).
Mindezek mellett a játékosok meg is tudnak őrülni (4 épelmével rendelkeznek, ami elég gyorsan fogyhat), így képességeik csökkennek és kevesebb akciót hajthatnak végre.
Ha ez nem lenne éppen elég, akkor bizonyos esetekben dobni kell egy spéci kockával. Ha szerencsénk van (mintha 6-oldalú kockán 5-öt vagy 6-ot dobnál), nem történik semmi, de ha nem, elindulsz a lejtőn.
Normál fokozaton két játék során esélyét sem éreztem, hogy nyerhettünk volna, olyan hamar elvéreztünk és rászabadult a világra a gonosz. Szinte semmi jót nem dobtunk a kockákkal és szerencsétlenül jött ki szinte minden. Azt el kell ismernem, hogy ilyen formán elég jól visszaadta azt a hangulatot, hogy az Ősi szörnyek elleni küzdelemben az embereknek sok esélye nincs.
A tábla mellett a kártyák kivitelezése remek, külön tetszettek az ereklyék, azonban a műanyag figuráktól többet vártam volna kinézetileg.
Nálam marad a „sima” Pandemic és kiegészítői, ezt a rókabőrt nem nekem találták ki, pláne nem ilyen áron.

With my two favorite games being Cthulhu Wars and Pandemic, this variation, upon hearing about it, earned a guaranteed spot on my shelf.

The game does not disappoint. The Lovecraftian look and feel embeds itself, almost rightfully so, into the Pandemic universe along with its associated and solid mechanics. Unless the lore and Great Old One's say otherwise, you will be able to find all the similarities with the original and pick up on the gameplay right away. The game board and evocative artwork are gorgeous and kicks the components up a notch. 

The flow is smooth, but can get bogged down by complacent overlooking of slight rule changes, especially to veterans. Also, I foresee only getting this to the table for those that have prior knowledge and interest of both Pandemic and the Cthulhu Mythos. The base game seems to still be easier for families to get into (which is ironic, because this game is actually a tad easier to play). 

Nevertheless, this game was made for me.

I can't believe how nice this game is. I never liked the theme of original pandemic, so when this came out I was really happy to get it as it is so similar to the vanilla game with an interesting theme for me. Light game with some interesting choices. It's amazing how engaging this game is being so easy and fast to play. I love playing it with my wife when we want something light and have limited time. It takes around 30-40 min in average.I don't like playing with more than 2 players though. If we want full game we just use 2 characters each. Love it!

Many familiar elements to those who know Pandemic, but changes for the Cthulhu theme. Familiar elements for those who are familiar with Cthulhu themed games, too. Close gates and fight cultists and shoggoths. The old ones come out to make things harder in various ways, such as diminishing resources or changing the rules for the worse. There's even an insanity mechanic, although I haven't seen that in operation yet.

We have played Pandemic + all expansions as well as Pandemic Dice extensively, and have completed Pandemic Legacy. We are also avid Elder Sign and Eldritch Horror players. This version seemed a bit basic. It has some wrinkles that the others don't have, but isn't enough to bring it into its own. It's a solid rendition of Pandemic, but with so many ways to play Pandemic, I can't see bothering with this, even though the theme and components are really nice.

Locations are grouped into towns (about 5 per town) so getting around is a bit easier via the taxi mechanic. So this seems more flexible than regular Pandemic where you shouldn't get jammed up as much with bad cards and stuck in a region of the map, helpless to get to where you need to go.

There are Relic cards mixed in with the regular location cards which are similar to the yellow cards in Pandemic that give you power ups. They always cost a (surprise!) chaos die roll for a random bad effect (what you would expect). The game adds on Shoggoth which require 3 actions to kill (you get 4 actions). Regular cultists only 1 action. Shoggoth spawn when the event card is pulled from the deck. There are only 3 Shoggoth minis, and if you have to spawn one and can't, the game is over. One key note is that when you pull an event card, you DO NOT reshuffle the discards and place them on top of the deck. I thought this was a bit odd and nowhere near as challenging. However, it did become less predictable as to where the cultists, etc. would appear next.

There is a track of Elder God cards which are pretty neat. Each one hoses things up. If the track runs to the end of the Elder Gods, the game ends (like the outbreak track in Pandemic).

I mostly felt this game was ho-hum. Everything looks good and it plays fine, but my character had mostly nothing to do except wander aimlessly and whack the nearest cultist. The other 3 players really got to do the heavy lifting and had more fun with the game. The last third of the game I was really drifting aimlessly as we "cured" a couple of colors and I was usually out of position to help work on keeping the other two colors in check, and never had the right cards to cure anything.

We did get close to running out of cards. If it went another turn or two we would have lost. However, I never really felt stressed out or pressured to get things done. Stuff came onto the board, stuff left. I got bored.

It gave me an almost same exact feel to original Pandemic when I played that when it first came out. Honestly, I didn't think it was any good back then and I am a huge co-op fan. I was not alone in this assessment. Over time, as the series matured with more expansions, Dice, Legacy, etc., my opinion has taken an about face and I really enjoy what Pandemic brings. Unfortunately, Reign of Cthulhu seems to have me revert back to my original feelings regarding Pandemic - ho hum. I am not compelled to play this again, but my wife loves Cthulhu and has also grown to enjoy Pandemic so we will probably still buy it. It just won't be anywhere near the top of the list of co-op games to play, especially these days.

Nice variant of Pandemic. Removes the chain outbreaks and replaces it with old gods that either have immediate effects or permanent effects that will last for the rest of the game.

The shoggoths making their way towards the gates are interesting mechanics.

Still uses the get 5 cards of a color to close a gate/cure a disease which I'm not a fan of. Hoping for an In The Lab style expansion that can maybe change that.

A cool co-op game on its own: between the Old One powers, the characters and relics, it makes games different from one another. However, it is the weakest Pandemic game, and is too similar to deserve table time on its own. Between the heightened randomness of the dice and the Shoggoth placements, and the simplified logistic puzzle (which is my favorite part of vanilla Pandemic), I probably won't play it again, especially given how many better iterations of Pandemic (Legacy, Iberia, vanilla, Cure) there are.

An excellent take on Pandemic, only with the theme of fighting cultists seeking to summon the Great Old Ones rather than fighting four plagues across the world. The mechanics of Pandemic have been neatly adapted to the theme, and the board art and design of the game is gorgeous. The unique character minis are very nice, even unpainted, and the artwork for the character cards and Great Old Ones cards is very well done. The box has a great insert for holding all the game pieces. As with any Pandemic game, there are several ways to lose but only one to win, and the gameplay is tricky and tense but very fun. A must-have for any fan of Pandemic or the Cthulhu Mythos.

First game bought at Spiel 2016. We love Pandemic here. We love Eldritch horror but that's a long long game to just play here and there. This combination of theme and gameplay of Pandemic is perfect. There are some nice twists to the gameplay. It's like Pandemic (placing of cultists and summoning deck). But also different enough. Like the Ancient ones cards, insanity and Soggoth monsters. 

I'm wondering one thing though. Why are the cultists so small compared to the player miniatures? It doesn't really make them look menacing haha. 

Rules are easy to learn, especially if you played Pandemic before.

RATING: 6
Initially I thought this was just a cash grab, but there have been many significant changes in this Cthulhu version. You will notice the map is much smaller, and to balance that most locations have fewer connections and you can only perform what were originally flight actions in Pandemic at certain locations. It is also easier to share cards. The enemies thematically spawn Shoggoths that move towards the "gates" (cures for Pandemic) that progress the equivalent of a merging of the outbreak and infection track, rather than having diseases outbreak. Some of the more difficult to perform actions are easier to perform here, but then you lose sanity and doing so can make your character's ability weaker. This game borrowed the virulent strains from the On the Brink expansion, but changed the effects to better fit the theme here. I don't know if I like it more than base game Pandemic and I definitely like it less than Pandemic with expansions, but it is a nice variant that has a change of mechanisms that conveys the different theme well, and it is a little bit shorter albeit a little more luck-based.

Finally, after all the overhyped, overloaded FFG attempts, a Lovecraft cooperative game that just works, and is a fun game.  The generic nature of the clue cards affects immersion a bit, but not remotely as much as the eternal dierolling and rule check in Arkham Horror.

the more I play it the more I like it. Not a big fan of cooperative games, nor not a big fan of the pandemic theme. So for me, this was the way to go for a pandemic (non-legacy) game, even though funny enough I'm not either a big fan of the cthulhu theme (it's been exploited enough if you ask me). The game is too easy on the first mode, but medium or expert level make it more challenging as discarding a card could cost the game. 
This game would be more playable if there was an expansion that would add more variants. Either a few more Old One cards, and at least 4-6 new character cards. When you play at a full variant count a couple of times, the combinations between the same characters feels too samey. Some new more relics would also be enjoyable without having to change the core mechanics of the game.

Seems very close to Pandemic, but not enough to be a rip-off. Some rules are easier, however there is high randomness, and difficulty levels are not really working well, so if you are lucky you will win on easy with such card advantage, that it could be as well on hard. Does not make much sense. I'd prefer rules modifications than simply less cards (and slightly more frequent Evil Stir).

Lovecraft Mythos - Co-Op

The artwork in this game is fantastic. I particularly enjoy the colors picked for the miniatures and summoning cards. The board itself is designed well and feels as if it is ripped straight from the pages of Lovecraftian writings. A+ on theme.

The gameplay is fast and never feels stale. It's Pandemic in Lovecraft skin. The sanity dice was a creative way to make the game morr challenging. B+ on gameplay.

Overall this is a solid game in which I recommend to most people, especially those who like the Cthulhu theme.

Pandemic with a very cliche' spin... I mean, it's thematically interesting, I suppose. It seems a lot smaller than your base version of Pandemic, but there's some interesting things going on here. It's fun, and there are some new mechanics introduced here (to fit the theme), but... ya know, ultimately there's a lot of games I've got on my list that I'd rather play than this.

My brother got me this as a gift, so I guess it's the thought that counts.

RATING: 6.5
An interesting spin on the pandemic mechanic, with some nice minis.  The retheme just feels a bit thin having played Arkham horror and Eldrich horror.  The game is too abstract to convey the collection of clues and sealing of gates.  The sealing of gates also doesn't stop the rise of cultists in a particular area which seems like an odd mechanical choice.  Prefer the regular pandemic mechanic of exploding outbreaks rather than revealing old ones (seems a bit odd to have all the old ones awaken)

An okay game, that I'd play again if someone brought it.  No desire to own it.

Compared to the base Pandemic game I feel the overall context is weaker. The equivalent of outbreaks has a much more random effect which translates into a much reduced feeling of impending doom (a strength, imho, of the core game). The game is thematic with the Cthulu setting but it generally lacks suspense.

Mi opinión en http://zacatrus.es/u/miqueljornet:

☛ Jugado en el Espai Jove y en Gavà (gracias a David III y Eneida).

✔ En mi opinión, el tema es más agradecido que el de Pandemic original... prefiero estar matando soggoths y cultistas que ver como brotan y rebrotan enfermedades por diferentes países del mundo.
✔ Han sabido pasar por el chino (hablando en términos culinarios) la mecánica original de Pandemic para reducirla a los 40 minutos que promete la caja. Desde el turno uno la tensión se dispara con una optimización de la relación de localizaciones del tablero, la manera de viajar y un mazo más delgado de cartas que nos obligará a resolver el puzzle lo más rápido posible. Aún así, hay que tomar decisiones muy interesantes. Todo está muy medido y ajustado para que sea un cooperativo tenso, rápido y difícil (como debe ser).
✔ Las reliquias y los primigenios se han sabido incorporar brillantemente en esta edición para balancear el efecto de las ayudas con el de las putadas que te depara el juego. Además hay bastantes cartas de los dos tipos, cosa que ayuda en el factor de la rejugabilidad.
✔ El arte es muy bueno, en este apartado aromático pero importantísimo para este tipo de juegos, me recuerda al "viejo" Witch of Salem (que Devir editó como La Sombra de Cthulhu) ilustrado por Franz Vohwinkel con un tablero con pocas luces y muchas sombras que te metía de lleno en la noche del posible fin del mundo sin perder ni un ápice de usabilidad.

✘ No mitiga el efecto líder... pero eso es "marca de la casa" de todos los Pandemic. ¿Lo tomas o lo dejas?
✘ Las cartas podrían ser de mejor calidad, piden a gritos fundas por tener los bordes negros, porque se barajan constantemente y por ser de un cartón sin entramado y con un ligero toque plastificado que huele a "Made in China" (pero la China más económica). Aún así se agradece el tamaño diferente (tipo tarot) de las cartas de primigenios... le va que ni pintado al tema, como pasaba también con las cartas de Divinare.
✘ El dado de cordura puede no gustar a algunos jugadores, sobre todo a aquellos que ya se habían acostumbrado a domar el elemento azar intrínseco de Pandemic... pues aquí hay otro, y a veces es determinante para el resultado de la partida.
✘ A todos los Pandemic se puede jugar en solitario de manera no oficial cogiendo dos roles. Quizá este Pandemic: Reino de Cthulhu se merecía una implementación oficial para jugar en solitario sin tener que usar dos roles y falsear que juegan dos cuando en realidad sólo juega uno. Creo que es un esfuerzo de diseño que habría valido la pena hacer para equipararlo a otros juegos famosos de temática lovecraftiana que oficialmente sí ofrecen opciones muy interesantes de juego en solitario (Arkham Horror, Eldritch Horror, El Símbolo Arcano o el reciente Arkham Horror: El Juego de Cartas).
✘ Las miniaturas de los cultistas son muy pequeñas en relación con las de los investigadores, ya se entiende que debe ser así porque están sustituyendo los cubitos de plástico que representaban enfermedades en Pandemic... pero siendo sólo 26 miniaturas igual se podría haber encontrado una solución más elegante (te acabas acostumbrando y son funcionales, pero soy muy exigente). Todas las miniaturas tienen una numeración debajo de la peana... todavía no sé para qué y por qué.

I just played this game last week and enjoyed it very much.  We lost the first game and won the second by the skin of our teeth.

Played it a couple more times.  Once we lost before all 4 players even got to play.  Less eager to play it now because who wants to spend 15 minutes in set up and lose in 5 minutes?

Played again last night and won for the second time ever.  Folks were ready to give up, but I managed to figure out one last way to win--the player who closed the final gate did it when there were no cards left to draw at the end of his turn.  Whew. :-)

A nice thematic remake of original pandemic with some twists - too bad it's in English only as this could be one that I could play with my kids as well. It's not that easy and there is some more luck involved with the sanity die and the old ones (especially the one where you need to discard sanity tokens) but overall a very enjoyable experience!

For me, this is better than base Pandemic.  It's really good on thematic elements and design. As for game-play, I feel like there's so much to worry about that there's more room for non-obvious decision-making in the game (compared to Pandemic.) It's often not clear whether to fight the shoggoth, work towards closing the gate, or fight back the cultists.  This version of the game, brings Pandemic closer to Ghost Stories - not only on theme but in difficulty as well. (Only ever play on the hardest difficulty!)      
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a shorter game than most Pandemics.  The strategy is just different enough to make it noteworthy.  The way each god impairs the play instead of causing an outbreak was novel, and the use of bus stations was very good.  The components are excellent.  I'd prefer that the game weren't as simple, perhaps using an item deck or placing one-use items on the city cards.  If you would be attracted to a less complex strategy game than say Pandemic Legacy, one with a Lovecraft setting without the random events found in most Lovecraft themed games, this would be a good buy.  After several games though, I've found that I'd rather have more strategy or more events and items found in other Lovecraft games.  Just a little more substance, like the god outbreak mechanism they used, would have gone a long way.  Had a lot of fun playing the insane taxi driver.  Pandemic Iberia was better IMO due to the disease rule add-ons.

Pandemic: Die Schreckensherrschaft des Cthulhubasiert natürlichauf dem grundlegenden Prinzip des Koop-Hits Pandemie. Aber das beliebte Lovecraft Thema wurde nicht einfach nur lieblos über das fertige Spielprinzip gestülpt, sondern an vielen Stellen sinnvoll verbessert. Fangen wir bei dem Spielmaerial an. Das Spielbrett wirkt unglaublich düster und fängt die schaurig-schöne und morbide Atmosphäre von Lovecraft gekonnt ein. Statt bunten Würfeln, die die Viren und Bakterien in Pandemie darstellen, gibt es hier Kultisten und Shogoten. Die Miniaturen sind ordentlich umgesetzt und tragen ebenfalls zur Stimmung bei. Die großen Karten der Alten, sind ein gänzlich neues Spielelement und sehen optisch ebenfalls toll aus. Auch der Spielablauf selbst bietet einige Änderungen: Das Ziel der Spieler ist es nun, 5 Dimensionstore zu schließen. Auch dafür müssen die Spieler 5 gleichfarbige Ortskarten sammeln. Ausbrüche gibt es hierallerdings nicht stattdessen, findet jedes Mal wenn ein vierter Kultist an einen Ort gestellt werden müsste, ein dunkles Ritual statt und ein weiterer Uralter erscheint. Gleich passiert, wenn die monströsen Shogoten, die sich über den Plan bewegen, eines der Dimensionstore erreicht. Sollte irgendwann Cthuluhu selbst erwachen, ist das Spiel verloren. Gleiches gilt, wenn alle Spieler dem Wahnsinn verfallen sind, oder ganz klassisch: Wenn keine Kultisten mehr im Vorrat sind, oder keine Spielerkarten mehr nachgezogen werden können. Die Schreckensherrschaft des Cthulhu ist spannend und sogar noch etwas kniffliger zu meistern, als das original Pandemie. Einziger Nachteil im Vergleich zum Vorbild: In den bisherigen Partien kam es mir so vor, als hätte jeder Ermiller nur wenig verschiedene Möglichkeiten. Meistens gab es einen Weg, den man mit seinen Aktionen bestreiten musste. Aber vielleicht ändert sich dies noch, mit weiteren Partien!

RATING: 5.5
Puntos fuertes: Muy bien ambientado, relativamente fácil de aprender, calidad del tablero, calidad de componentes (miniaturas chulas), con las cartas no se han roto la cabeza.

Puntos débiles: Efecto líder con jugadores noveles. Repetitivo, no tiene más. Es extremadamente difícil, por lo que puede llegar a desmotivar.

Conclusión: Es un juego que funciona mejor a 4, aunque escala bien. Después de un par de partidas se hace monótono y realmente es bastante difícil derrotar al juego (a menos que juegues mal). Si la temática te encanta y los Pandemic, puede ser ideal. Pero no es nuestro caso. Es un colaborativo bastante simplón.

Surprisingly good for a Pandemic clone. I appreciate the theme far more, and this feels a lot like Arkham Horror in 30 minutes. I have a couple of nitpicks though. First, it's really odd to me that the player minis are bigger than both the cultists and the shoggoths. Also, and this point is more prevalent, I can't shake the feeling that I'm playing a spin-off game rather than a game that can stand on its own legs. I got that same feeling from Pandemic: The Cure, which I also liked, but for a game that is billed as its own board game, it doesn't feel like it. Regardless, I'm a Pandemic hater, yet it seems like every game they put out with the same style of rules works better for me. Reign of Cthulhu is the best one yet.

RATING: 7
Reign of Cthulhu plays like a stripped-down, streamlined version of Pandemic, with only one disease (cultists), a smaller map, pre-built research stations, and the awakening Old Ones working double-duty in lieu of outbreaks and epidemics. It’s also more random than Pandemic, particularly since it isn’t possible to prepare or compensate for some of the Old Ones’ powers or the movements of shoggoths. Overall, the game ranks decidedly below its progenitor, but it’s good enough on its own merits to be thrown into rotation with other Pandemic variants. 

Approved.

Un de mes meilleurs jeux actuels.
J'adore ce jeu pour les raisons suivantes: 
 - Le thème qui est mon thème favori dans les jeux de plateaux/société
 - L'accessibilité car coopératif. Une personne qui n'y connait rien va facilement se laisser prendre à vouloir sauver le monde d'une extinction quasi imminente pendant toute la partie
 - Le côté oppressant du jeu : il n'y a que des évènements qui sont pénalisant pour la progression des joueurs. Même les reliques nécessitent un jet de santé mental qui peut rapidement tourner au drâme
 - Les parties ne s'éternisent pas pour laisser part à une revanche
 - Les règles sont relativement simples (même si j'en ai zappé quelques unes au début)
 - Véritable challenge : le taux de victoire est assez bas et donne envie de rejouer tellement on est était si proche de sceller les tentacules de Cthulhu. Il y a toujours un shoggoth ou un cultiste qui traine pour nous achever xD
 - Matériel de bonne facture : très bon rapport qualité/prix

C'est l'occasion de faire découvrir l'univers de Lovecraft avec tout le monde, c'est que du bonheur à partager!

It's a nice merge of Pandemic mechanics with Cthulhu genre mechanics - change cubes to small Cultists and big Shoggoths to defeat, close a gate in each colour instead of curing a disease, add a dice to see if you lose sanity when you try to do major stuff (where losing enough sanity makes you a less-powered character). But you still need to do the Pandemic essentials - get the right coloured cards into the right hands whilst keeping the board as clean as possible. It's definitely more luck-based. You can get a rotten start at easy level and an easy game at hard level (which is simply a smaller deck). I liked how each pandemic/evil stirs card introduces a new random global effect - more luck but fun. The reason for rating it lower than normal Pandemic is that it feels smaller, less epic, where the smaller board seem to make the decisions as to the best path seem a bit easier as a result, especially once you've done a Legacy season. But good theming, and happy to play for fun.

"Nice evolution of Pandemic, and it's my favorite so far (edging out The Cure), even though I'm not a huge fan of the mythos. The stronger theme and added variability compared to base Pandemic is nice. The components are great. I can see where serious gamers might prefer Pandemic (especially with the expansions), but this is better for us."

What I like:
- Excellent blending of Cthulhu theme and Pandemic mechanisms
- Beautiful presentation with excellent components
- I appreciate some of the streamlining they did
- Accessible to non-gamers and casual gamers
- Reasonable gender mix (3/7 female)
- The insert seems quite good

What I don't like:
- Still not a fan of the abstract set collection inherited from Pandemic
- A couple of the rules can be hard to remember
- The sanity die can be a bit swingy

My learning solo 2-investigator game took 45 minutes, as did a 3p game with 2 first-timers. That's a really nice length. I would put the weight right around the same as Pandemic, as it is probably slightly less deep, but with a couple extra rules.

I almost bought this, but I'm glad I held off until I played it. I like the theme quite a bit and the miniatures look nice, but the components are chintzy just to accommodate a $50 price tag and still include the miniatures. It's like they skimped on everything else.

I feel this one is far more luck dependent than the others, which is fine as it plays reasonably quickly, but you can go from one turn looking like you're going to blow through the game and the next to almost being dead. It's far less predictable than base Pandemic. The die rolling is a little obnoxious seeing how fast you can easily eat through your 4 sanity.

Overall, glad I played it, would play it again and may even request it, but I have other iterations of Pandemic that I liked more. This feels a bit too hobbled together. Not sure how long my excitement will last for this one.

RATING: 10
This game is fantastic in terms of artwork, play-ability and thematic consistency.
The game mechanics are easy enough to be picked up by all of the family while posing enough of a challenge with customisable difficulty levels to entertain even the most die hard of Lovecraft fans.

It has everything you would expect from a lovecraftian game including your impending doomed finale!

Work together as a team (because that always works, right?) to beat the Old Ones and voila! Game won!
Quibble or faff around and you will find yourself in a unique combination of situations that can be somewhat hilarious.

The miniatures are not intended to be painted, however, work perfectly fine and are still aesthetically pleasing for their purpose and price-point.

Excellent graphic design and re-theming where the immersion is completely broken by the social justice warrior female hunter character. I don't get why they had to do that because the medic was the most popular character in Pandemic? The reporter and occultist were thematic fits. At least they added a form of limited character selection to the game.

Pandemic: Reign of Cthulhu is a snappy and innovative retheme of the classic co-op game, Pandemic.

After 1 year since i got this game, i still enjoy it. Even more when playing by myself. It can be a little bit frustrating when you're like 1 or 2 turns away of beating the game and some bad rolls or draws completely ruin your attempt, but overall it is a fair game and although very simple to learn, it does require some level of thinking and strategy to beat it. I also love the theme, and my friends always enjoy playing it, some even prefer this over Blood Rage (another favorite). The minis are average at best, but they are convincing enough to draw attention when painted. The board it's a bit dark, but that fits onto the theme for me. I like the overall art aswell but i gotta admit that the cards are kinda on the cheap side of the spectrum.

If you like Pandemic, Chtulhu, or both, this is a solid game.

A quick playing game and one which my hosts for the night had bought, but not unboxed *sigh*. I punched, sorted and learned the rules in about 15 minutes and had them playing (mostly on their own) in another 10. Three 'Easy' games ended in three whupping defeats, with at best one gate closed. There was no-one playing with previous [i]Pandemic [/i]experience, so I assume there were some fundamental tactical/strategic errors made, but even so it did seem to smack them down every round.

Okay - let's clarify for a moment...i absolutely love all things Cthulhu (except for Cthulhu himself..he is a big jerk) and I am a huge fan of Pandemic and/or Pandemic mechanics-based games. I have just read the rules and I am pretty close to 100% certain I am going to go crazy over this one (and frequently in it no doubt). Throw your tentacles in the air like you don't care!!! And sure enough - not disappointed! It is different enough from Pandemic with the gods popping in and making life difficult, shoggoths shambling around and carefully when and when not to use the relics with their potentially brutal price. Nice and quick too - of course quicker if you lose but once familiar, this is a 30-40 minute game.

The driver became insane due to an Old One, but I hanged by a thread, even managing to survive a Shoggoth before sealing the fourth gate. The game didn’t seem too hard, but I suppose things could have slipped pretty quickly. Ann suggested to play again the next evening, so all in all a success.

I haven't particularly enjoyed Cthulhu games and this is no exception.  Pandemic is a fine game, but I hate this version.  It's sooooo swingy.  We lost the first game we played in the second round.  We quickly started over and played again - we were able to close 1 gate before we lost.

Why do people play this crap?  Ugh.

Good change from vanilla Pandemic.  The fact that there are only 4 "Epidemic" cards means games are less at the mercy of the randomness of the deck.  The variable sequence of the Old Ones means each game is a little different in the effects that appears.  And having the Shoggoth appear on "Infection" rather than just more cubes/cultists gives you something interesting to focus on.  Sanity effects/going insane/gaining your sanity when closing a gate seems a little convoluted and tacked on to be more thematic; it's easy to forget to roll for sanity at the appropriate times.  If you love Pandemic and Cthulhu, go for it, but I still much prefer Pandemic for being a better choice for family and non-gamers.

This is a refined, faster-playing version of Pandemic with a radically different theme.  We got through rules explanation, setup, and a three-player game ending in victory in about 45 minutes.  It simplifies some parts (player cards are per region instead of for a specific location, there's only one variety of cultist instead of four diseases), adds Shoggoths as a new mobile threat, and replaces Outbreaks with Awakening Rituals that reveal Great Old One cards that add new penalties.  The fact that Awakening Rituals can't cascade like Outbreaks do seems like the game is less prone to sudden failure based on drawing the wrong location, with the progression of bad stuff having less variance.

Completely unnecessary. If you REALLY love the Cthulhu mythos, then, sure. But this is just Pandemic with thematic twists.

The "curing" is almost identical. Money grab.

Michelle likes it better than the Cure, since she doesn't like being constrained by the dice.

I love Pandemic, which is one of my top 3 all-time favorite games. I was excited for this, since I enjoy the Lovecraft/Cthulhu mythos. I was pleased that this game is more than a simple re-wrapping of the Pandemic game with a Cthulhu theme, and it is an easier play than the Arkham/Eldritch Horror games.

However, the gameplay is very simplistic, and more reliant on luck than the regular Pandemic games. Additionally, I felt like despite our lack of cultists and Shoggoths on the board, we somehow managed to awaken the old ones rather easily. There is also some major holes in the rules, such as what happens if a Shoggoth is spawned directly on top of a gate location? (This happened in each of my two plays).  With the fewer number of locations in P:RoC, it made this a more of a possibility than having an outbreak imediately with a card pulled during the Epidemic phase of regular Pandemic.

Overall, I really was excited and wanted to love this game. But, I'll pass and stick with my regular Pandemic.

1 play, solo

Interesting twist on Pandemic (cultists vs. disease tokens; sanity; Great Old Ones). Seems to be a bit easier:
- 4 regions with generic cards for each region (town) rather than specific city cards
- Cultists only have one color
- travel: 
... Pandemic's flights are now bus rides, taken only from specific locations (bus stops). You can go to anywhere if you spend a card of your current location's color; or to any location in a specific town (color) if you spend that color card
... you can also travel between open gates, potentially costing sanity
- no Outbreaks. Instead:
... you reveal a great old one who has either an instant effect (e.g., lose sanity or cards) or an ongoing effect (e.g., require an additional card to seal a gate).
... Shoggoths roam the board: harder to kill than Cultists but reward you relics (=events) for killing them

Fun enough, I suppose, but not as interesting as Legends of Andor (the other co-op game I've been playing recently solo).

I would rate this one similar to the original. There are some advantages: I think movement is easier, I like the Great Old mechanism, it's prettier and short, while still being tensed and challenging.

On the flip side, I think they could have found a better way to handle shoggoths than just using 3 actions to remove them, madness and the madness die are not necessarily well-implemented, the games needs a better rule to increase difficulty, its missing the signature "spread" effect of the virus in the original when you would add a 4th cultist, and there is a potential huge issue at the start of the game: with the luck of the draw, you could have the right card color to exchange and close a gate on turn one. 

Good, but a few missed opportunities here.

Finally a thematic Cthulhu game I can play without being bogged down in constant rules checking and feeling like I'm following a formula instead of roaming around Lovecraft's world!
My first play was solo just to try it out using the detective and hunter. Won the game with just one Old One to go before Cthulhu appeared, with the hunter left with two sanity and the detective at one. And, the hunter pulled the last two player cards before the detective on his turn sealed the last gate.
Components are solid, theme is fine. No regrets putting Arkham Horror and Eldritch Horror up for trade.

Please note that as avid Pandemic fan, and a passionate Lovecraftian reader, I was disappointed by this game. In general, the art is nothing to be proud of, the place names are boring and generic ("Market" and "Woods"? Really? I cannot understand why they didn't use something like "Whateley Shack" or "Miskatonic University"). The art of the Old Ones are often quite well done and the minis are fantastic, but the rest of the game is lacking in aesthetics. 

It seemed to me that the mechanics are too simple and I feel that the tension doesn't really build as well as the original Pandemic game. The artifacts often don't seem to make sense when used in the game either.

All in all, I felt this was a half-assed attempt at making a game that really had great potential. Perhaps a second edition will fix these flaws.

Adding a die to the already challenging game of Pandemic means that there is even more chance that something bad will happen before you're able to mitigate it.  I wish there was a choice to be made when rolling a die, such as discarding a card from the draw deck in order to re-roll.  On the other hand, the production values for the game are fantastic.  Love the investigator minis as well as the shoggoths.  Cultists are so-so, but still more interesting than cubes.

Thought about it, but this will remain a standalone and, while it being a decent game and probably preferred over vanilla Pandemic because of theme, not good enough to win me over from the expanded Pandemic (both regular and artscow event deck) I own.

„Pandemic – Czas Cthulhu”, czyli epidemia szaleństwa.

Plusy:

1.	Oprawa Graficzna.
2.	Znana mechanika i zasady.
3.	Solidne wydanie.
4.	Regrywalność.
5.	Poziom trudności.
6.	Wypraska.
7.	Klimat.

Minusy:

1.	Jakość kart i wymiary kart Przedwiecznych.

„Pandemic – Czas Cthulhu”, to tytuł, który łączy dwie, bardzo lubiane przeze mnie rzeczy, a mianowicie „Pandemika” i prozę Lovecrafta. To połączenie „kupiło mnie” już w momencie pojawienia się pierwszych informacji o wydaniu tego tytułu. Rozgrywka wciąga gracza w szaleńczy wir walki z Okultystami i Przedwiecznymi już od pierwszej chwili. Oprawa graficzna i figurki oddają klimat znakomicie. Rozgrywka jest dynamiczna i emocjonująca. Jak w zwykłym „Pandemiku” mamy wiele do zrobienia a mało czasu. W tym tytule nie przytrafi się nam rozprzestrzenianie choroby i reakcja łańcuchowa, co jest logiczne, przecież kultyści nie rozmnażają się przez mitozę, ale za to mamy przebudzenie Przedwiecznych. Shoggothy potrafią skutecznie uprzykrzyć życie i doprowadzić do szaleństwa. Jedyny mankament to wymiary kart Przedwiecznych, do których nie ma idealnych koszulek. Gra jest bardzo dobra i z czystym sumieniem polecam ją każdemu, lubiącemu grać w „Pandemika” i lubiącego klimaty Lovecrafta. 8/10

RATING: 5
Just doesn't feel very tense. Game play is a more involved than Forbidden Island - more little things to remember like rolling for sanity, moving the Shaggoth, etc. However, with Forbidden Island I can feel the water lapping at my ankles; there's tension as more and more of the island sinks away. Reign of Cthulhu just didn't seem to capture that edge-of-your-seat feel. Even when we were close to losing - Cthulhu would be making an appearance next - we didn't feel any tension.

We haven't tried removing Clue cards yet to increase the difficulty, though I'm not sure it will make any difference. Not sure why. The artwork is nice, the figures and neat... it just doesn't "feel" tense like it should considering the theme.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
First Impression:

Take pandemic, add an overhyped popular theme, mess the mechanics to make it look different, don't think about it too much and voila, here comes Pandemic Reign of Cthulu.

Pros: It's a cooperative game with a strong theme. It's difficult and does have some decision making.

Cons: Rushed with too many things not working properly. Variable player powers? Some are great, some are indifferent, some are plain bad. Smaller map and more restrictions to movement cut an incredible amount of choices for the players compared to regular pandemic. Abominations exiting through portals very easily create unwinable games. In short you may have lost but still need to play half an hour more to actually end the game. Sanity feels fiddly and added just for show as it plays a very minor role and is easily manageble. Artifacts are a wrench on the mechanics that most of the time feels "meh" and some times may make a difference. Also, on a more personal note, I really hate the theme, especially when compared to basic pandemic.

Overall I'd rather play Pandemic. I'd give this game another chance if someone insists, but chances are very low that I'm going to change my opinion.

RATING: 6.25
It is better than base Pandemic, but still not great. I did like the smaller, simpler map, the more straight forward movement, and cards that are not space specific. I found planning my turns to be much more straight forward. Unfortunately, I still felt a bit lost at times, going around and killing cultists, not sure how to contribute to the win condition. Also, the game felt a bit too short. I felt like in every play, the limiting factor to our success was running out of player cards. I felt like the game was over just as we got the team dynamic down for our characters.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It is okay.  If Pandemic didn't exist I'd probably like this game more.  It is just pretty similar to Pandemic but not as good or varied.  There are some minor mixups, but I don't think owning this and regular Pandemic is worthwhile.

About [thing=192153][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=192153][/thing] is a reimplementation of many of the mechanics of [thing=30549][/thing], as you have the same:
- 4 actions per turn;
- drawing cards (for the hand, in order to deal with the matter at hand; and to advance the problem);
- case of having at most three of something in a place, and if there is the need to add more in that spot, another issue happen;
- way of travelling using cards;
- special characters with, mostly, the same abilities;
- end to the game when the draw deck ends, when the advancement of the problem reaches its limit, when there is the need to add something to the board and there is none left to be put.

To the point that, if you know [thing=30549][/thing], you will be able to play [thing=192153][/thing] in about 5 minutes, as the differences are very minor:
- there is a Sanity mechanic;
- there is the use of Relics (which work as the special cards from [thing=30549][/thing], but some stay out of the main deck, and there is a danger in using them);
- there are Shoggoths.

That is mostly it. [thing=192153][/thing] is mostly [thing=30549][/thing] with some few cosmetic changes.

For the complexity, [thing=30549][/thing] is wedged between [thing=30549][/thing] and [thing=65244][/thing], and is very similar to the one in [thing=136063][/thing].

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
Once the set up is done, each turn the player will have 4 actions, and the possibilities are:
- walk (1 AP per place);
- fight cultist (take out 1 cultist);
- special movement (using the bus stops or portals);
- fight Shoggoth (first roll the madness die, then use 3 actions; the player gains one Relic card);
- give or receive cards (1 AP per card; limited to cards of the same city both players are in; except Relics);
- seal a Gate (requires 5 cards of the city the gate is in).

Use Relic cards don't cost action, but the player must roll the Sanity die.

After the player has used her actions, she draws two cards. If one of the cards is a Evil Stirs the steps are:
- Fight madness: roll the madness die;
- Reveal the next Ancient One;
- Draw the last card of the Invocation: a Shoggoth is placed there;
- Shuffle the Invocation cards in the discard alongside this last one drawn, and put above the rest of the Invocation deck.

Then cards are revealed from the Invocation deck. These put cultists on the board. If a place already has 3 cultists and one is to be put there, the next Ancient One is revealed. If a card has the Shoggoth symbol, all the Shoggoths on the board walk one space towards the nearest open Gate. If the Shoggoth is already in a Gate and must move, it leaves play and the next Ancient One is revealed.

The game continues until the players seal all the 4 gates - they win! Players lose when:
- a player needs to draw a City card and there is no more cards in the deck;
- a cultist must be placed and there is none left;
- a Shoggoth must be placed and there isn't one;
- Cthulhu is revealed;
- all the players have mad characters.

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
Which action to use. For the majority of the time the decision will be: where to move, considering the need to stop Shoggoths from reaching the portals, and taking out the groups of cultists.

More than what happens in [thing=30549][/thing], trading cards will be more often and the coordination of is very important to win.

While the use of special cards in [thing=30549][/thing] is given, in here, considerint that playing Relics can have a dire cost in Sanity or bring more cultists, the decision of when take the risk of using one (normally just before sealing a Gate) is important also.

Coordination of places to meet, isn't as relevant, since trading has become much easier to be done and the board is smaller.

I was surprise to see that [thing=192153][/thing] is lighter in decison-making then [thing=30549][/thing].

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Good production value: the art is well done and the pieces and cards do the job just fine;
- Tough to beat - I like my cooperative games hard to defeat;
- Easy to teach and to play;
- Playing time is short enough, which is good for a hard game, as it calls for repeated plays;
- Fine level of replay level.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- The theme is, sadly, not as strong as I want it to be, being pretty thin;
- Prone to alpha player;
- The randomness of the Sanity die can decide games.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Not what I was expecting, for sure. It is a surprise to me that [thing=192153][/thing] is actually simpler and [u]less[/u] thematic [thing=30549][/thing]: the greater simplicity comes from making easier to trade cards and to travel; and the system of [thing=30549][/thing], of diseases spreading, is simply perfect for the mechanics used, while in [thing=192153][/thing], it just doesn't work as well, even when adding things like Sanity, Ancient Ones, special items from the Mythos, the overall feel is lacking, at best.

Yet, I had a good time with it. I played several times in a row. Then some more. And I still want to keep coming back to it. [thing=192153][/thing] is simply a breeze to prepare and start playing, and the game goes by very fast, in a lively pace. The challenge is high, and this is, maybe, the key to its survival: it makes players want to go at it again and again. In don't particularly enjoyed the weight the Sanity die has one the results -and is not even a matter of learning when is acceptable to roll it, because the Evil Stirs cards make the player roll the die. For now I see it as part of the challenge.

In the end, I recommend [thing=192153][/thing] as a shorter and simpler version of [thing=30549][/thing], one that mostly works exactly the same, but has enough small changes to make the overall experience new, even if reminiscent.

RATING: 9
Easily my favourite light cooperative game. Takes the excellent mechanisms out of super dry base Pandemic and adds theme + some very nice twists. Board is very nice looking and full of details, relics are interesting to use, Shoggoths are cool (minis are a plus) and the awakenings of Old Gods keep the game fresh. If you don't mind the fact that some setups are unwinnable by chance and enjoy Cthulhu this is a must buy. Definitely recommend this over other Pandemic versions. I hope that the expansion comes out soon and adds more of the same.

RATING: 8
Enjoyable adaptation, which is easy to teach and quick to play, whilst still managing to create atmosphere and tension. I prefer this to vanilla Pandemic. The rules are pretty clear and easy to digest, and the game set up time is fairly short once you've played a couple of games. Playing time varies, but is generally 30-45 minutes, in my experience so far.

Negatives include the fact that I think it is a bit over-priced. The components are all good quality, but the miniatures need painting, and the biggest niggle is that the scale differs between the character and cultist/shoggoth figures - I would rather they were all the same scale, and hope that someone on Shapeways will create character minis that match the scale of the cultist figures.

All in all, I would recommend this game, but if you are not desperate to get it, wait till you see a copy in the £25-£30 price range, as I think that more accurately matches the game's value than the £40 RRP.

Mediocre redux of Pandemic. More often than not Cthulhu fails to bring a sense of tension to the game, with it either being overly easy to deal with, or luck of the draw very quickly triggering every God. Although the old gods and their powers were fun to see, I felt many of them were not balanced, which some having the potential to drastically alter the course of the game, whereas others simply tickled and had minimal impact.

Finally got this to the table on the very last day of #Shametember as a double-feature with Isle of Skye. Just enough like Pandemic to be familiar, and just enough theme and new mechanics to give it its own flair. Theme did NOT feel tacked on, as we feared. 

The board and components are beautiful--colorful without detracting from the dark atmosphere. The board is a bit *too* dark, and fonts difficult to read, but the locations and card placement markers are minimal enough that one will soon learn where everything is and won't have to read as much to navigate after a few plays. The artwork on the cards are evocative, and the Clue cards couldn't be any easier to read if you tried. In fact, compared to the art and design on the other cards, they seem downright plain, sporting a simple woodcut style image in white on a solid color background; but I offer that as an observation, not a complaint.

The addition of Awakening Rituals (the cousin of Infection Rate) bringing out random Ancient Ones and various one-time or permanent effects definitely makes it feel more consequential to raise the rate, even in the early game. Shoggoths appearing and moving toward gates as a further risk to life and limb was also a nice touch. I was disappointed to find there was not a mechanic analogous to Eradicating Disease from the original Pandemic, save for a single "Elder Sign" Relic you may or may not draw which allows one gate to be sealed, preventing Summoning in that town for the remainder of the game (barring extenuating circumstances). However, in retrospect, with travel largely simplified, and a smaller map of locations to deal with overall, if one could seal each gate with an Elder Sign, the run to the end of the game to close the final gate might be quite flaccid.

One part I felt was weak was sanity. The random die roll feels out of place in a Pandemic game, taking you out of the action/roleplay more than I thought it would. The inability to regain any sanity except by being the one person to close a gate, or a draw random Relic, is frustrating, and not in a "gee whiz that's a bummer" but a "dammit, why can't I just go to a sanatorium and heal up with action points or something?!" Maybe a house rule is in order should this continue to chafe. 

My only other complaint is the miniatures. On the one hand, as lovers of miniatures, we're happy to have them and it enhances the thematic immersion of playing different roles. However, the necessity of keeping the cultists small enough to spread 26 of them all over the board means they look like tiny little blue Jawas next to the Investigators, and the awesomely-sculpted Shoggoths lose their imposing power when we still stand a half-head taller than them side-by-side. I almost would have preferred a more abstract threat in lieu of the cultists (growing dread?) represented by tokens or cubes than teensy-tiny robed baby-people.

As with original Pandemic and its offshoots, the less players, the easier it is. With two players, we closed all the gates, and that was with overlooked rules that worked against us: we forgot to a) draw a Relic card each time we did and b) remove one cultist from each location in a town. We are also fully aware of the luck-of-the-draw involved, as with any Pandemic game. A few well-placed Summoning of Shoggoths on or nearer to gates and our Ancient Ones would have been awakening in no time.

Definitely an excellent addition to our complete Pandemic Collection. Looking forward to many more games!

Pandemic with a Cthulhu theme. Easier than the original?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a fun riff on the Pandemic game engine that replaces disease cubes with cultists, which of course are up to the no good deed of summoning the Elder Gods. All of the usual Pandemic actions are in play and for the most part they work the same way, although flight movement (in this case, trains) is much easier.

To make up for that mercy, the "cure" deck feels about half the normal size. You can move faster and easier, but you have to, because you blow through the deck in a flash. Like the original Pandemic, running out of cards is a loss condition, so players find themselves under pressure right from the start.

The other facets of the game are completely different. Outbreaks are gone, replaced with a completely new mechanism. When a fourth cultist enters a space, an Elder God is summoned, bringing the game one step closer to ending and adding a crippling effect or condition to the game. They are all punishing, and if you let them happen they accelerate your death spiral.

My overall take is that this is a fantastic reworking. I've heard some chatter that it is easier than Pandemic, but I don't see it. While it has certainly streamlined the original ruleset, the game feels like it moves faster and wasting cards on bad decisions seems much more costly. Maybe it is more susceptible to easy wins due to random shuffles, due to the small decks. It's possible, but for now, I find it extremely fun and challenging.

I played a prototype version, so far only in solo.
Pandemic is a great game, and this game proves that, because even though this is basically Pandemic without the outbreaks, which is one of the most interesting mechanisms, this game is still good. I hate the Chtulhu theme, but I still enjoyed this.
The sanity die makes it more swingy than it should be, but it's nice that using event/artifact cards costs something, the characters have an insane side and that with each "outbreak" you get a new negative event.
I would play this over Pandemic only if other people really want this though.

Thematically, for me, this is a better version of Pandemic which I'd prefer playing over the original.  Adequate components.

Still feels like classic Pandemic, but with some some neat twists in the mechanics. I like it, but I miss the  outbreak mechanism, it was the heart of Pandemic design and the very thing that made it unique. On the other hand, Reign of Cthulhu took a chance and refreshed the old formula by adding some interesting new rules and streamlining the old ones. It's definitely worth checking out.

nice reimplementation of Pandemic.
YES, it is meaningfully different from the basic Pandemic and the differences make it a very good experience. the different Old Ones seem to make it quite hard to win and in every game they come up differently. The way Shoggots appear and move is also interesting and managing insanity makes everything more exciting.
Even if i am completely outside HPL world, it does feel thematic!
If you like Pandemic, you will also love P:RoC

Great components, perfect Inlay - neat game.
Only issue: The rules are a bit more fiddly than vanilla Pandemic. The rule book is fine but during the game it is easy to forget some of the new steps (rolling the dice, moving the Shoggoth, etc...)
Anyway I like it more than vanilla Pandemic because the theme is so present!

Normally I am skeptical when two well known franchises join forces for a collaborative effort.  And that was how I felt going into Arkham-Pandemic, but my skepticism was ill placed.  These two systems and themes were made for each other.  I am very pleased and impressed with how they married the escalating threat of outbreaks, travel system and set collecting of Pandemic with the urgency of time, horror, gate closing, relic items, and insanity of Arkham.  Cleverly woven together. Fun and entertaining. Pleasantly surprised.

I really like this variation of Pandemic. Much more fun banishing cultists and closing portals than curing diseases.

If I'd never experienced any other version of Pandemic, this one would be pretty cool.  But I have, so [i]Reign of Cthulhu[/i] is worth another 1-2 plays at best.

Even if you're a co-op debutante considering your very first Pandemic purchase, I recommend skipping Cthulhu and following the recipe below.

1. Purchase Pandemic Legacy.

2. Play the base game (using the Legacy set) for a full year, or until you tire of it.  Shoot for 10-12 plays of the vanilla version, minimum.

3. Grow bold and switch to the Legacy version.  Play the full campaign with the same three gaming buddies, and marvel in how much it changes the original.  If it takes 5-6 months (real months, not game months) to finish the campaign, don't worry about it.

4. Never play Pandemic again (any form), and be satisfied. Until Legacy Season 2 is released.

Good scalling for 2 players, best playing 4. Eldritch Horror is much better, also Mansion of Madness. But still enjoy playing. You need to know that game is pretty random and can crush you in one round.

This is a great option if you don't have the original Pandemic or if you prefer the theme.  It has the base feel of Pandemic with just a few extra things to spice up gameplay.  I wasn't expecting to like it, but it was actually pretty good!

Pandemic: Reign of Cthulhu takes the solid mechanics from Pandemic and gives it an interesting theme. I even painted the minis for all the figures. They add a sanity die, which adds a great new layer. If you go insane, your ability could become detrimental, or you lose it altogether AND you get one less action per turn. I like the Old Ones waking up and causing a huge terrible effect. I do feel that the Hunter MUST be in every game, as my only gripe. I enjoy this MUCH more than standard Pandemic, but no where near as much as Legacy.

Cthulhu themed Pandemic is different/simpler in some ways, but different/cooler in other ways... I like it as variation and hope to see more variant versions...

A cross between Arkham Horror and Pandemic capturing the feel of both.  A bit on the light side, but still decent.

Played once and really enjoyed, but need a few more plays to get a good feel. Had all the hallmark elements of Pandemic that everyone loves, plus Cthulhu flavor. A really great "skin" but no real major game changes.

Fair twist for an original Pandemic, but nothing to write home about.

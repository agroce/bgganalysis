RATING: 9
I've played all the Carcassonne games, but this is the only one that I love. It is separated from all the others in that there aren't any confusing additions to it. It is simple and elegant. It scales well for more players, and reminds me of putting together a puzzle and playing dominoes, which remind me of how I got into gaming in the first place.

130929 I think I must be returning to gateways or something.  My opinion of this has gone up over the last year even though I've played it only once.  Maybe teaching it to my mother in law reminded me of the brillance of carc's design.

120910 Funny how time changes your view of things even if you don't play it.  The confusion over farmer/city area majority has changed such that I prefer the animals now.  Well that and maybe expansion fatigue -- even though I've never actually played a single game of carc with any expansions.

100103 I don't like the added complications over Carc Orig.  But its the copy we have and if its ever brought up, I'll play it.  But yeah, I like the elegance and simplicity of the original rules (4th ed or so).

RATING: 9.5
After the first play I think the comments I had read about H&G were right. This is the more compact and gamer version of Carcassonne with one serious drawback: the graphic is far less attractive than in the original one. In contrast I like all the minor rule changes. If Carcassonne is a 10 (and it is) then H&G deserves the same. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Prehistoric version, so not really Carcassonne itself, but the great game mechanic is intact and scoring is SO much simpler.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I find this better than the original Carcassonne and play this quite regularly as a two player with my wife.  I haven't played it with more than 3, but my oldest boy (eight)now plays.  It's fun, a little challenging, but not so much that your brain will hurt after a hard day at work.  There's a fair bit of luck in it, but I'm not one of those that denegrates that factor - because a genre I love (wargames) also has a lot of luck, to go with their depth and strategy and tactics.  The card art is good here, too.

The game does need more expansions, though.

RATING: 8
Fantastic, although we were playing it incorrectly at first by only scoring rivers when the whole river system is finished. I think I almost liked it better that way since "cheeky" river scoring can be so (too?) lucrative (7's aren't uncommon, and it's *much* harder to push in on a river than a forest)

RATING: 7.03
Haven't found the bonus tiles to be as game breaking as others seem to suggest...

A fun "stone-age" variant of Carcassonne that, importantly, is a stand-alone variant rather than just an expansion to the base game.  It is a fun game, and big props to the franchise for its popularization of tile-laying games, but there are better tile-laying games out there.

After a few plays... I like how the scoring is a little clearer than Carcassonne.  My son picked it up quickly, though perhaps not the hut thing as I beat him soundly. It hasn't quite grabbed me as much as I thought it would.  Maybe I'm a bit tired of Carcassonne...

I agree with others that the busy artwork on this one detracts from its appeal, and also insist on playing it with house rules that take the potential overwhelming power out of the Stonehenge tile and make the Aurochs worth 3 points instead of 2 like all the other animals.

I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

Hunters and Gatherers is a cute little spin on the Carcassonne formula but, from my point of view, it still feels pretty much like the original game. I like Carcassonne alright and I liked this game as well, just I wouldn't choose this one over the other. If only become Carcassonne has a lot of expansions that improve upon the base game, while this game doesn't.

Hunters and Gatherers is a good version of Carcassonne but one that is not different enough for me to prefer it over its predecessor.

I played a few times and I think I liked the gameplay better than regular Carcassone (those @#¢ farmers!). However, I do not like the graphic design: too busy. For this reason, if I had to choose one of these two, I would probably play regular Carcassone. The thing is that I do not have to choose, therefore, I play other games.

Late to the party on this one, and I was seriously missing out. Is it possible for games be more charming than this one? I'm not sure. A perfect combination of beauty and elegance in gameplay. I also find the scoring and theme more satisfying than the original. The evocative artwork makes the game that much more rewarding.

RATING: 8
I rated H&G higher than regular Carcassonne mostly based on the hunters scoring mechanism, which is easier to score than farmers. If your opponent has a meeple down in a field with scoring animals, you can "take out" an animal by adding a tile with a tiger to that field. H&G provides opponents with the ability to directly affect the hunter's playing area. 

In regular Carcassonne, I find that the farmer scoring system is awkward to score. Farmers can score adjacent cities even from the "other side" of it, so you have to track everything carefully. This can get confusing if the fields are large and the farmers/cities are numerous. 

H&G scales extremely well. I've always enjoyed it as a 2-player game. Just recently, we played it with 5 players (inc. 3 new non-gamers). It's so easy to teach and everyone "figured it out" fairly quickly. We had to add a variant rule to minimize downtime though - everyone picked up their tile after placement so that they could think about their next move while others were taking their turn. 

On an interesting note, My bf was encouraging others to try to "screw" other players by adding extra meeples to areas, which doesn't work so well in H&G. Since his friends like that sort of thing, I think regular Carc (with Inns and Cathedrals) would be better for that. Next time we'll try that configuration. 

The other random thought is to modify the rules for H&G so that if there is a tie, then the score is split (vs. each player gets full points)... and maybe add the big meeples to the game to create more competition.  

UPDATE: I haven't played H&G for a long time... however, if I need to bring a game over to a house of non-gamers who like card games, I'd bring this one. My bf and I did just this - we took H&G and Settlers of Catan, and H&G hit it off big time while SoC had a partially interested crowd that ended up coming and going at the game table.

In terms of theme, H&G is light years ahead of Classic Carc, and the artwork is vastly improved. I would describe the rule changes as being "tweaks", rather than complete changes, but it does make for a very different game, and worth buying if you already own Carcassonne. Unlike other geeks, I don't find H&G more competitive than the original: it's about the same.

Have had trouble with the bonus tiles though as one or two very powerful ones totally turn the game around. Have the scout expansion tiles and made some of the print and play expansions. No need for any of them really but it is fun to change the game around a bit every now and then. V is an expansion junkie and wants to play with all of the expansions, all of the time!

My most played game because it's girlfriend and 2-player friendly.
This was one of the first games I bought and I really liked it at the time - demonstrating Carcassonne's standing as a great introductory game. 
I've since grown to dislike tile-laying designs of this ilk because there's nothing you can plan or even think about until you next draw, and if it's a crappy tile then too bad. The problem is increasingly mitigated as the number of players decreases, and I still like this as a 2-player, it's ok with 3, but I wouldn't play with any more than that.

An out-of-print edition of Carcassonne, set in the stone age. Yet it's not just another re-skin; there are some substantial changes in this game. For example, you have only five meeples (not seven) and you have hunts that will score

RATING: 5.6
Something about this one bugs me. I know they're quite similar, but I don't really like this one much at all compared to regular Carc. It's something with it being more childish, to count animals instead of the original farmers who gets to count finished cities. Also I think the board is much more cluttered, it's quite difficult to see what is where and how long things stretch sometimes. Regular Carc is a lot cleaner.

I do like the "Hi there!"-meeples, though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This is better than the original Carcassonne without expansions. The game plays exactly the same as the original carcassonne.
The hunters are more balanced than the farmer in the original game, you can play the tiger to the opponents side thus reducing their points, where before you could not do anything besides trying to merge your farm with the farm of someone else.
There's a bonus for finishing other players forests (in Carcassonne with the Traders & Builders expansion there's also a benefit for finishing other players cities).

Finally got a Carcassone game and based on the comments and ratings on BGG, I chose this one. Interesting and certainly fun, but seems long for what it is, but that is easily remedied to by removing some tiles.. or playing faster. Enjoyable game in good company.

I'm not sure I'd rate this higher than Carcassonne. From the few games I've played, the fewer meeples equates to diminished control. Color scheme makes it hard to see certain tile features and the animals are somewhat hard to distinguish from a distance. Nevertheless, a fantastic game...At this point I prefer the original with the Inns and Cathedrals expansion, but barely.

RATING: 8
This was one of the first euro games introduced to me as a gateway game.  My wife and I loved it, but we played it to death.  Works well with both two and three players.  My kids pick this up pretty easily, but it's hard for them to do well against an older player that is decent at the game.  My excitement/interest didn't last too long with this game, although I have to give it credit for grabbing my attention and easing me into euro strategy games.

Egy kicsit talán jobb, mint az eredeti Carca, van benne néhány jó új ötlet, de pontban nem mérhető a különbség szerintem. A halászok, a bónusz lapkák és a tigrisek feldobják, könnyed, nagy szerencsefaktorú átvezetőjáték ez is.

Hunters and Gatherers is everything the original Carcassonne should have been: is much more balanced (rivers and forests are equally important, while in the orginal Carc cities scoring dominates), the meadows are both simpler and nastier than fields, the huts add another dimension to river scoring, and the bonus tiles are a nice addition that adds variance and decisions to the game.
I prefer the original Carcassonne as a two player nasty affair, but now that I played this version...  Hunters and Gatherers IS the game of choice for a head to head tile laying brutality!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very interesting. It was as if they took the best parts of Carcassonne and put them into a box. I would see this as a streamlined version of it. They kept the fun and yet maintained the play time to that of the original Carcassonne base set.

Like the part where huts are permanent structures which will earn you points at the end. Highly recommend this to all.

Well, I've tried it a few times and am mildly impressed.  I enjoy some of the changes from the original such as the gold pieces and the fishing huts, but overall I still prefer the original.

For me, the most glaring drawback is the artwork.  Everything is too green and too busy.  We have had several occasions of placing a tile only to see that there IS a jungle bordering a plain.   This doesn't happen in the original.  

It is a fun game and I have enjoyed it as much with five as I have with 2.  I'll play it, but only when my wife asks me to.

Update: dropped it down a point.   I've played both this and the original a coulpe more times since first rating it and I much prefer the original.  I'll still play this, but I have to be convinced.

RATING: 8.5
One of the better twists on the usual Carcassonne formula. Has a more intuitive mechanism for scoring fields (Hunters vs the usual Farmers) as points are awarded for the animals in it, not the number of complete cities it touches.

The simplistic 'thief on the road' is replaced by a much more interesting notion of 'fishing' and streams with fish icons in replace the road system. An additional concept of area control is in this one, with player's claiming entire river networks using the 2 fishing huts, for endgame points.

Even the city building aspect has been tweaked into 'forests', and completing a forest which has at least one gold nugget on will let you draw and play a powerful special tile.

RATING: 5
After one play; its a happy little paralell the original Carcassonne. Some minor differences but arguably not enough to justify it as a seperate purchase.

After many plays on line I now find this game deeply irritating. The strategies and tactics are obvious after a few games, it then just comes down to the draw of the tiles. As much as a player might try to block thwart or manoeuvre, there can be no really skilful play as you are at the mercy of what tile falls for each player. 

Great for those who rely on blind luck to win the occassional game, deeply frustrating for anyone who likes to plan out an approach to a game.

Rating reduced to a 5. No real wish to play again.

Fun fun fun!  Simple to play (although the written rules seem longer &amp; more intimidating then they have to be).  My girlfriend likes games but hates listening to rules, so this turned out to be a good fit.  The right combination of strategy &amp; luck, although the last time we played she killed me by joining a field with her sacred shrine to the rest of the board, walking away with a ton of points.  In any case, fun, easy to learn, and still a good dose of thinking.

I'm torn between a 6 and a 7 for this game, but it might settle to a 7 when there are fewer new games out there---for now, while I cut some of my gaming teeth on Carcasonne, the mechanic is getting old to me, even with new twists.  Still, great game for playing with more casual gamers, and if I don't play the game for a while, my like comes back with a fervor... 

I still much prefer the original theme, and will see how it plays with the expansions.  As a result, I'll probably end up trading or giving my very little used copy as a gift.

Pros
Easy to play
Nice theme
I find the rules an improvement to Carcasonne, not scoring the uncomplete forests/rivers, and the hunters are easier to understand than the farmers
Not many expansions (I like to collect things like expansions and if I had Carcasonne it would be a nightmare!)

Cons
Sometimes get annoyed by the luck element
Some people, myself included, can be quite ruthless in placements which can lead to a less aesthetic board

RATING: 8
Nice alternative to vanilla blue carcassonne.
Although it's probably better than its progenitor, I'd take blue carcassonne + expansion over this any day.

I also think this is way less confrontational and that a lot less ruse is involved.
There are far too few meeples and only two huts (too easy to split a river system between players... too hard to secure it)... 
Also, I like the bonus tiles, but some of them are too powerful and some quite useless... this greatly improves how much luck has an impact on the game (in a bad way). Which tile you're going to get is already luck dependent... but if you have some one-of-a-kind powerful tiles, the player that gets it will probably get hate from the others...
So... this is quite unbalanced.

Next... the fact that there are so few meeples and that completing a forest even though it's not yours will get you a bonus card hinders confrontation.
Usually, in regular carcassonne, when someone has a 4-5 pieces castle, it'll start looking tasty to the other players... Here, when a player has a forest that you can finish, you usually do it only to get the bonus card.
One of the things I enjoy the most in blue carcassonne are the epic battles for castle domination.

And... leaving game mechanics aside... the game is quite ugly and too "busy". It's quite hard to get a quick overall view of the situation.

Still... although it might not sound like it. it's a good game... but a good game with its fair share of flaws.

Nice variation on the Carcassonne game with a theme that fits the game better in my opinion. Also the slight rules variations make for a bit more interaction between the players. With the bonus tiles the game can become a bit luck dependent. Very good family game.

Excellent game! Since I have a background in RPGs and this game is really lacking in fireballs and magic swords, I was not really certain I would like it. Too weak on theme or something.

At the same time, there is some luck involved (drawing of tiles) and I like that, I want some random element in my games. Works great with two players which is a added bonus.

This "sequel" is certainly better than the original.  By focusing more on the tactical play, H&G mitigates some of the extraordinary luck of basic Carcassonne.  The scoring appears more balanced and fields no longer dominate play.  Unfortunately, it still suffers the fate of all Carcassonnes, it's just too long.  This type of game should really be hitting around half an hour instead of 40-50 minutes.

I find this game to be for the most part very quiet and lacking in enough player interaction. The game is very light and relaxing and just barely has enough meat to keep my interest. My wife and our friend like it enough though that it will probably see more plays soon.

RATING: 5.5
Better than basic Carc.  Why?  Because you get a bonus tile (extra turn) for completing gold nugget forests.  It results in tougher tile placement decisions.  If you want a comparable game of basic Carc., you need to buy the Traders & Builders expansion for an extra $10 or so.  That said, all of the Carc. games are too random for my taste.

If you can avoid paralysis by analysis of where to place your tile, and play with always having a tile in your hand (pick up immediately after placing) you can move the game along quicker.  The more I play, the more I appreciate the simplicity, and the domino-like placement.

It's like Carcassonne but more wild. Animals eating other animals is fun but what I enjoy the most is the incentive to finish opponents' forest that the gold nuggets create. I feel that the fishing huts are the weakest point because there aren't enough of them to be competive with.

I thought this would be a good substitute for Carcassonne + T&B + I&C, but it fell flat for us. Something about the forests never having special qualities (other than the nuggets) and the river systems being both really important and really hard to gauge, I think. Also I was surprised by how much the green-on-green coloring made it hard for us to gauge what was going on.

My favorite version of Carcassonne. I never liked that uncompleted roads still score full points and uncompleted cities still score halve points in the original game (which was only partially 'fixed' by the first expansion). In H&G, rivers and forest only score when completed. The scoring of meadows is also improved: it doesn't depend on adjacent completed cities, but on how many animals are inside; there are animals that increase and others that decrease the value. The huts in river systems are interesting as well, and getting bonus tiles for completed forests with gold nuggets makes it sometimes a good move to complete somebody else's forest just to grab the bonus tile.

I traded for [b]Carcassonne: Hunters and Gatherers[/b] because I have [i]Carcassonne: King & Scout[/i], and I had been wanting to play the "Scout" half of the expansion for a long time.  However, H&G is really just a re-themed [i]Carcassonne[/i].  Instead of cities, roads, and farms, you have forests, rivers, and meadows.  Scoring for the features in H&G is only slightly different from regular [i]Carcassonne[/i].  I think that the differences in scoring would have been better as an expansion for [i]Carcassonne[/i] instead of creating a new game.  I have long since traded away H&G. 

If you already own [i]Carcassonne[/i], I wouldn't buy [i]Hunters & Gatherers[/i].  Too similar to regular [i]Carcassonne[/i].

I don't like the original Carcassonne, which I find sort of boring and random (esp. the farmers). This game is a bit better. The scoring is much simpler, and the rules are actually even more streamlined. The hut and field battles can get pretty vicious too (my wife closed off one of my hut networks early on -- arrgh). Overall I would pick playing this over vanilla Carc any day.

RATING: 7
You know, it's kind of bizarre, but while Carcassone did absolutely nothing for me, I think Hunters and Gatherers is OK. Maybe its just the more appealing art, maybe it's the less incomprehensible scoring rules for "farms", or maybe it's just that you've got to play these games with the right people. I dunno. But C:H&G works for me as a solid second-teir game.

I much prefer H&G to traditional Carc and all its expansions.  This is a good one for me because it is not TOO thinky, but still rewards solid strategy.

We house rule that players have 2 tiles at any given time and can choose which to play to avoid someone getting hosed unfairly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I got into Carcassonne really late in the game, and had to make a choice: either buy the base game and invest in expansions, or get the un-expandable, but better out-of-the-box game that is H&G. I went with the latter, and I'm glad I did.

This is similar enough to base Carc to not make a HUGE difference, but H&G does contain some welcome tweaks. Specifically, hunters' scoring is clearer than farmers (and it adds a nice little way to screw each other) and rivers feel better-balanced than roads. The huts add another small dimension to the long-term strategy. And finally, the all-or-nothing scoring in this game feels more in line with the press your luck nature of the game, though I can see why it might turn some people off.

The bonus tile system is interesting, though some feel a bit overpowered. Hasn't been a big deal in our multiplayer games, but in 2p it can kind of make or break. Still, the two most powerful tiles are also somewhat situational so there are ways around it.

Worth noting: This is a good deal uglier than the base game. There's an odd fluorescence to the colors, and the tiger just looks plain weird.

Even though it's a decent game, I don't like that you can't block people from getting into your rivers with their huts! It makes it so easy for others to grab many points for themselves which you have been worked hard on getting. Also, the random bonus tiles you draw vary in power and usefulness, and it can be hard to win if you don't draw good tiles. Nevertheless, I think that C:H&G might be just a tiny bit better than the original Carcassonne without expansions; however, when you throw in an expansion or more, Carcassonne is the superior game by far.

My recommended number of players: 2, 3

It's a better more balanced game than Carcasonne in many ways. Obviously the hunter is better than the farmer. Not as aesthetically attractive though as the original and there is just something more satisfying to building a city than a forest. I realized also that I enjoy the added make-it-or-break-it drama of the original. Either way, I enjoy all Carcs as perfect two-player games: Relaxing pastime, accessible play, and I'm not (too) upset when I lose.

My criterion for rating games

http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/147053/item/2300390#item2300390


1) Sense of wonder: Each game plays differently with which tiles you draw and which special tile you end up with.

2) Meaningful/fun decisions. Lots of choices about where to place your tiles, meeples, and fishing huts. Also when to close yours or your opponents forests to get access to the special tiles.

3) Player interaction:  Has a lot more player interaction than base Carcassonne because of the special tiles. Still not up to the level that I really like, but it has some take that factor.

4) Components/artwork: Very nice tiles. The artwork is very nice and evocative.

5) Game length/complexity: Perfect length game for what it is. Very simple to teach to new players and we can be playing in 5 minutes. Not quite the complexity I am looking for in a game but perfect for a 45 minute filler on my friday night game night.

This is a streamlined version of the original that puts th issue of farmers to bed.  It also has a clever addition with bonus tiles and a new concept of huts that gain points at teh end for the river system.

My only complaint of this game, is that the colors are too similar to distinguish the features - especially in lower lighting and if you are a bit tired.  If the graphics and been more like the video game, this would be my favorite vanilla Carc game.

This game is great for 2-4 players, but even with 4, you end up spending a lot of time watching the other players ponder each move.  Certainly with 5, I tended to lose focus between turns because I would literally be waiting 15-20 minutes.  But the premise is good and the gameplay is excellent for fewer players.  Also, the wife seems to like it even though she is definitely NOT a gamer.

RATING: 5
The franchise doesn't deserve the massive amounts of praise that it has received, but it still works as a decent gateway, and an enjoyable way to spend 3/4 of an hour with a friend, *one* friend. A 2 scale only game for me.

The problem with Carc to me is that it is purely short term tactics based on what you draw, and seeing the better things to do with a given tile usually isn't particularly hard. There's just not a lot of tension or challenge, in particular when the franchise is compared to its precursor, El Caballero.

I do find that the puzzle-ish nature of the game turns off some people immediately though...so I think the gateway potential for this game might be somewhat overstated...

On one positive note: the breakdancing meeples are awesome.

RATING: 9
Best in series, this version improves on all the base games quirks and foibles.  I particularly enjoy playing two player with my wife; light, quick, and fun.  Yeah, we're talking a tile drawing game, so sometimes you'll get crap and lose, but played two player this can be very tight.

Excellent, but the new Builders and Traders expansion stole some of its thunder.  I find it might be a little easier to break in new players (such as my 10 year old niece) on this one before moving to the "proper" game.  Great variant with neat twists.  Watch out for the tigers!

Expansions: King & Scout

Notes: Bought for then received back from Wife's parents

Thoughts: A perfect mix of all the best elements of the original Carcassonne and it's expansions. Add the tiles from King and Scout and you can't go wrong. Usually preferable from the overwhelming nature of the monster that Carcassonne has become with it's many expansions.

I enjoyed this enough to add it to my collection, even though I alredy own the original Carcassonne and Carcassonne: The Castle.  I enjoy the subtle differences between all three of these games.  The Castle is great for two players, the original is great for more complex games (as long as you're playing with the expansions) and Hunters and Gatherers is a more streamlined return to simplicity.

This was my second installment of the Carcassonne series (after The Castle) and I always enjoy playing this game, although it doesn't get out much these days. What I like about it, in comparison to the original, is that players are not really dependent on drawing the correct tiles as much: this is a Good Thing. (The 9-square regions of Carcassonne are nice and all, but require quite a lot of luck with the tile draw.) Not so in H&G: its point gathering structures don't require a leap of faith as big. The game is easy to teach, plays well with any number of players, is over quickly, and despite the fact that luck is exceedingly dominant you can mitigate it easily due to the sheer amount of possibilities to put a new tile. It is also a direct hit with non-gamers. To make a long story short: simply fun.

RATING: 6
This game takes the basic concepts of the beloved original and then twists it into something different with rivers instead of roads and forests instead of cities.  But a few things are unique here, like maximizing animals to score points in fields, and bonuses offered for finishing certain forests.

You would think that a game so close to one that I love would be a natural fit.  And yet I feel like the changes add too much randomness and make it hard to plan ahead.  After a number of plays I couldn't get a handle on the strategies or why I was doing well or poorly.

Not a bad game by any means, but I'd rather just play the original and its expansions.

Components: Doris Matthäus is a tough act to follow as artist, but Johann Rüttinger has done a great job. The tiles are of exceptional quality. The animals are easier to visually tabulate than completed castles are in the original.

Experience: More elegant than the original, this sequel to the original Carcassonne is easier to teach, easier to score, more intuitive, and just as fun to play.

The stone monument, allowing a player to claim a meadow, is too powerful. The addition of the bonus for closing forests, and the penalty for not completing forests or rivers at the end of the game, lends itself to smaller areas than in the original Carcassonne, which also means that there are frequent small scores rather than infrequent large scores. Adding fish to the rivers has a similar effect as adding inns to the roads in the original. Very satisfying to play, and of course the board looks wonderful when complete. It's fun to see all the animals mingle in the meadows.

I enjoyed this, but...  It feels a little more complicated to play than the original at first because it seems like there more things to consider when deciding where to place a tile, which slows the game down.  It may be that this will eventually decrease was we become  familiar with the tiles, but the "30-45" minute playing time listed on the box seems completely impossible in a game with 4 or 5 players.  The problem with this is that despite all the time you invest in finding a good place for your tile, the game still comes down to luck of the draw.  Strategic decisions you make may not pay off for you down the line.  I'm willing to forgive this in the original because it plays so fast and feels lighter.  This one takes longer and makes you think harder about what you're doing, then fails to reward the best thinker, instead rewarding the best tile draw-er.  That's a drawback in my book.

As a standalone game it probably merits greater than a 6, but since I'm coming from the original Carcassonne, I'm finding too many niggling little differences to make playing H&G a wonderful experience.  It's fun, but too hard to keep the differences in mind, and that just bugs me.

I prefer Hunters and Gatherers to normal Carcassonne.  The bonus tiles give you incentive to complete features, the game makes for a tighter map and all of the map features have importance.  This is the version to get.

I'm always down for a game of Carcassonne. I like the "help each other out" feature of the game. Not many arguments here. Just fun.

This is the cleaned up version of the original carcassone. For a first introduction to Euros, I have had 100% success rate with players loving the game. Scoring is much easier than the original.I like the meeple design symmetry in this version much better than the original, and also that no expansions are needed. 
UPDATE: everything I said above remains true. I just cant leave it at a 9 now that I've played other games like Caylus and Blue Moon City. Nevertheless a very solid starter entry into tile based euros, and you won't be dissapointed. rating 8

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Better than the original, IMHO, in that it distills the game a bit more into tactical moves (get in, get the points, get out).  The farmers are gone, replaced with the easier to explain hunters.  Also, the tile design is much better, as the designers benefit from the additional insight of the expansions released since the original game (for instance, three sides of forest can be broken into three separate forests, or two and one, or all one).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
I prefer this game over the base version mostly because of the extra layers it has (fish in the streams, animals in the fields, bonus tiles, etc.), and because it kind of turns the strategies from regular Carcassonne on their head.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I feel like I can appreciate H&G better for having played the original first; not sure that would have been the case had I played them in reverse order. This version of Carc has a lot more immediate scoring and less long term planning/building. I don't necessarily favor one over the other, depends on mood.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Similar to regular Carcassonne with Traders & Builders and Inns & Cathedrals expansions added in, but without the additional tiles added in. This is good, as it doesn't add too much to the game length, but provides the additional scoring opportunities and complexity.

What I liked:
* Carcassonne with a bit of a different flavour
* A bit more balanced than vanilla carc.
* Placing tigers is fun (allbeit a bit cruel)

What I didn't like:
* Not compatable with Carcassonne
* Doesn't offer the expandability of carcassonne
* Artwork isn't bad, just could have been better

Personally I can't really split original carcassonne and this one. They are slightly different but basically the same thing. If you don't like one, you won't like the other.

A different game than the basic set, but one I appreciate differently and almost as much.

Rules Modifications:

The Aurochs Drives a Hunter Away. We now play with the rule, as officially (??) changed: After having placed a tile with an Aurochs, the player may remove one Hunter from the meadow in which the Aurochs was placed. The pawn is returned the owner’s supply, and it may be used again during his next turn (normal rules apply).

Placement of the Shrine Tile. We've adopted the "two meeple" rule change suggestion: Using the existing placement rules, any Meeple placed on the shrine is worth two hunters. Fields could then still be shared, although a higher Meeple investment would be required to compete against the shrine. Applicable in two-player games only.

RATING: 7
New variant of Carcassone.  Tiles now contain rivers, animals, forests and meadows.  Your &quot;cave people&quot; are now gatherers (forests), fisherfolk (rivers), hunters (meadows, the old farmers) or you can build a hut on a river network.  Much the same as the old game, with a few subtle differences (no partial scoring at the end for rivers/forests incomplete, nifty special tiles, etc).  Probably don&#039;t need to own both games, though.

This game is very close to the original Carcassonne, but I rate it just slightly higher because I like the theme better, and the hunting rules are much easier to explain to new players than the farming rules.  Also, I really enjoyed how the fish, rivers and lakes worked, it's much more interesting than building roads.

Eh, don't see what the fuss is all about. A random and tactical game; a few meaningful decisions crushed under the tile draws, no long-term strategy to speak of. Neat gimmicks and good scoring. At least H&G is slightly better than the original.

RATING: 6.5
Gave this to my brother & his wife a couple years ago after they enjoyed original Carc. They love it, I find it dull. The bonus for closing forests results in small, repetitive features that just don't capture my imagination. Most scoring was "pinging" in our games, making tile draw luck key, with the rivers breaking the ties.

I played this quite a bit when I was trying to get others into gaming with me back in 2004-2006.  I recently broke this out with my kids 6 and 8 to try it again after a long hiatus, and I don't think I am so crazy about it.  I'm not sure I ever was, but it was an easy gateway back when.  For some reason I still really enjoy Carc: The Castle, but other versions of the game don't really do it for me.  I don't mind playing them, but I wouldn't suggest them any more.

The box is rough and beat up!  The pieces are mint.

Hamarabb próbáltuk ki a Déltengert, így már pár változás az alapjátékhoz ismerõs volt. Épp annyival változtatja meg az alapjátékot, hogy egy két szabály módosításával, a bónusz lapkákkal és az állatokkal, köztük a kardfogú tigrissel, érdekesebbé teszi a döntéseinket egy-egy lapka lerakásnál, megõrizve az alapjáték könnyedségét. A feleségemnek is nagyon tetszett, aki próbált a bónuszlapkák megszerzésével elõnyre szert tenni, meglepõen sikeresen. Míg én a vadászterületek és folyórendszerek bõvítésével voltam elfoglalva. Sokáig vártam egy folyókanyarulat lapkára, amellyel kiegyenlíthettem a feleségem folyórendszerében bónuszlapkából eredõ haltöbbletet, ami a játék második felében sikerült is. Csak a lapka lerakása után jöttem rá, hogy ezzel egy hatalmas vadászterületet egyesítettem, aminek a többségi tulajdonosa voltam két vadászommal, de a feleségem addig addig ügyeskedett, amíg talált egy olyan lapkát, az utolsó öt lapka között, amivel sikerült "beépítenie" egy vadászt a hatalmas vadászmezöre, megmenekülve egy nagy bukástól :). Végül a másik folyórendszerem hozott a gyõzelemhez elegendõ halállományt.

Very good tile laying strategy game which builds a wonderful spectacle as you play.  Much better than vanilla Carc in my opinion. I particularly enjoy looking back on all of the plays and areas created as the game nears its end.

The game puts a large emphasis on doing the best with what you have, which sometimes will not be enough.

**Highly recommend you play that each player has a tile in hand to play while others are taking their turn to reduce down time**

Played 10+ times with two players. We seem to get a runaway winner fairly often - especially when one player gets both the shrine and the tiger tile. This lowers my view of the game although perhaps we are playing badly and allowing our hunting areas to grow to large and thus become a target for the shrine.

A nice Carc game, possibly my favorite of the bunch (though this style of game isn't exactly my cup of tea). Ark of the Covenant is probably technically the better and more polished game of this series, but the look and theme of Hunters holds a certain appeal for me. I'll enjoy playing this one from time to time when I'm sleepy or just in the mood for lighter fare.

Carcassonne - Hunters and Gatherers is an OK variant for Carcassonne. I like the new theme and differences from the original. Some interesting new ideas and twists.

This is the version of Carcassonne that made me love the game, and after playing a good five or ten times it made me realize how great the original one is, and that I like the original even more than this one.  This one added a few more scoring options that require you to really zero in a certain parts of the board and do some counting.  It's not a hard task by any means, but it made me realize the simple beauty of design that is the original game where you look at the board and get a good sense of where everyone stands.

RATING: 6
Carcassonne: Hunters and Gatherers is better than the base Carcassonne game without expansions. In basic Carcassonne terms: (1) roads score more points than in the base game (2) cities are more high risk/high reward (each player only has 5 meeples, but when you complete one that has a minimum of 3 tiles, regardless of whether you get the points for it, you will draw a powerful bonus tile and place it (3) each player has two pawns which relate to the road networks to give end of game scoring opportunities (4) There is no partial scoring for uncompleted roads/cities (5) there are no churches (6) the farmer scoring is easier for me to parse due to some differences and is more interactive with opponents than simply trying to horn in on someone else's majority. Overall, while it's better than base Carcassonne, I am conflicted about it being better than basic Carcassonne with expansions. Swapping in and out various expansions with base Carcassonne can more easily tailor the experience to what a player is looking for, but chances are you're adding more tiles, which makes the game longer. Carc is better as a short game.

Be sure to play without the Shrine tile.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This has displaced the original in my books.

There are two main reasons for this: 
- The person who completes a forest gets the bonus tile so there is an insentive to complete other persons' forests. 
- Huts that affect the whole waterways.

These are nice additions to an already good system.

Some themes I just can't resist and one of them is stone age - so that was an instant purchase.

Interesting the first dozen or so times, but got old after that.  Well designed, and occasionally we pull it out to teach to someone, but I generally still prefer Settlers as a gateway Euro.  

Update 5-4-2012: Played this again recently (2 player, as usual).  Played more aggressively, thinking I might enjoy that more, since I generally think of the game as too light.  Actually, it made it worse, as the randomness of the draw was even more annoying.  

As a light game, preferably with 3 or more players, and ideally with a hand of 4 tiles, I would still give it a 6.  As a more serious game, it gets a 4.  So, downgraded to a 5 overall.

(As of [b]1[/b] play) A refreshingly self-contained spin-off of [GAMEID=822] that maintains the basic gameplay but introduces several new scoring mechanics that shake things up slightly. Luck of the tile draw is probably marginally more evident here, but not off-puttingly so.

I find it kind of difficult to imagine a person who would have a strong opinion on Carcassonne.  It's the most neutral game I can think of, and I am as such entirely ambivalent about it.

This version of carcassonne makes my head spin because its so different and so the same.

I am terrible at this version but I enjoy it as a change to the usual version.

I have been really enjoying this recently, but the gold bonus tiles are a little overpowered as why would you ever concentrate on anything except woods thus grabbing more tiles and therefore more points.

Sold in 2017.

RATING: 8
Although I played poorly and didn't adapt to the changes, and although I was shafted by the arrival of the Henge, I liked this version. A greater tendency to screwage but a nice result and I will definitely play again.

Played again twice in two days, 2P games against a different player. Got thrashed but 50+ points. I am rubbish at this. I liked it but I'm clearly doing something wrong. Not getting my huts in early is one thing.

This is the first Carcassonne game I played.  It may not be much different from the original, but I love the elegant system.  Wonderful concept of an ever-growing board as the game progresses.  Higher level players (who keep track of the tiles) will have an advantage.  Grade: B+

Has much of the same appeal as Carcassonne, with a little more complexity, but for whatever reason, I still strongly prefer the original to this variant, as well designed and interesting as it is.  While, I'm definitely intrigued by the added depth through features such as special tiles unlocked through completing forests (which are similar to cities) with gold or the river system of point scoring (which acts similar to roads, but with a lot more options), overall the simplicity of the basic Carcassonne game will always win out the day for me, and seems to be a more accessible and enjoyable game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
* Played 30+ times. It took a few playings, and I had to play CC with expansion again to remember the differences, but I was wrong in my inital assessment of this game. This game is quite an improvement over the original CC. Looks like I'll have to amend my review on funagain. Even the grpahics have grown on me. Far less luck with gigantic cities, does have some luck with now bonus tile draws, but the river/hut scoring really pusheds this game over the top making it more chellenging. Rewards good plays where CC seemed to reward the city hogs. [Owned, then gave gift, then purchased again. GF!]

RATING: 8
I enjoy Carcassonne, but I enjoy this version of it the most, so far.  I am not sure why, because it is pretty much the same game with rivers & bonus fish replacing roads & bonus wells, forests & bonus nuggets replacing cities & bonus pennants,and meadows replacing farmland. The same rules with slight variations--There are bonus points for various animals, and tigers can kill deer.  If there is a tie, both players score full points.  Perhaps I just like the graphics and the theme better.  

It is my Carcassonne of choice right now.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
in my minority opinion, this version is inferior to the original.  it's far more cumbersome to explain and the added rules add strategy but don't add 'fun'.  it's too complex for new gamers and it's not invloved enough for the rest of us.  maybe there was a good solid week of gamerhood where i would have enjoyed this one a lot.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
The scoring is a little more intuitive than the original game, and I like that rivers in this game are so important, way more so than roads in original Carc.  The bonus tiles are a good idea, but aren't much of an incentive to finish someone else's forest.  The goods tokens in the original game's Traders & Builders expansion accomplish this much more successfully.

Overall, H&G is definitely superior to the original game without expansions.  We'll be pulling it out with newer gamers as well as those who enjoy Carc but aren't as obsessed as we are.  For me and my "obsessed" friends, the original plus a bunch of expansions is still the best way to play.

I think it's best with fewer players and when all involved have a decent knowledge of the tiles; in that context it can be pretty brutal, which makes for a more satisfying experience.

After playing this for a while, it feels more balanced than the original, strategy-wise. The focus starts on forests for the extra bonus tiles, then shifts away.

After two online plays, I love this game. It is exactly what I wanted it to be. It plays like a slightly more in depth version of Carcassonne (although I have only played with a few of the expansions). It is similar enough that it doesn't really make sense to own both games, but I think I like this one slightly more than the original Carcassonne. The online play is a bit lengthy compared to how it (should) play out in person.

Scores are a lot higher than the original and it seems to reward "cheap" tactics better. (Like capturing a two section forest).  Consistent play and seizing of opportunities is far more important in HnG than in the original Carcassonne because the end game mechanic of hunting doesn't *seem* to generate as many points as the comparable farming in core Carcassonne.

H&G is more of a variation than variant of Carcassonne.  It follows most of the same rules with tile placement (and rivers are somewhat like roads; forests somewhat like cities). But otherwise there is a good amount of additional things going on that this plays differently than regular Carc. Especially enjoyable are the bonus tiles, which promote players shutting down forests early by rewarding tiny little bonuses (not enough to make the game feel like it's more random). Also enjoyable is the Hunter scoring, similar to farmers except there is this whole thing that happens at the end of the game where tigers hunt down the deer, reducing your Hunter score.  Positioning your tiles in the right way for your Hunters to score big makes tile placement even more thinky and enjoyable. And Huts score for big river systems - again making you think multi-dimensionally about tile placement. Perhaps there is a little much going on here for new or young players, but this is a perfect addition to the Carc family and I'm glad to own it!

Obtained via BGG trade.  I gave up my copy of Kablamo (in shrink) which I paid a fraction of its original retail.

[Original comment] Similar to Carcassonne, and I like it better. Especially more interesting for slightly younger players. A good, challenging family game. Most turns offer the player several options, requiring decision-making and planning.

(December 2006) We now play this with 7 players, and it is a definite favorite with our family.

May 2009 -- We still enjoy this game, but don't play it quite as often as regular Carcassonne.

Definitely THE most tactical and THE most mature version of Carcassonne. The art may not be the prettiest one but it's bearable. And although this is still Carcassonne you don't get deja vu playing it.

RATING: 8
The special tiles add a bit too much luck, and prevent me from rating higher. Unfortunately, this edition of Carcassonne isn't as good for playing with non-gamers. All things considered, I have to rate this the same as the base game, despite preferring it in many circumstances.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It's not that the artwork bothers me in this game, it's the fact that the tiles can be hard to read at times.  Just the same, this is a worthwhile game in the Carcassonne family.  I like the idea of the special tiles, and extra turn you can gain, should you be successful in completing your forest with that hard to see gold nugget.  Granted, being a hunter and/or gatherer I am not sure what good gold is.  :)

H&G might be the quintessential Carc game. Sure, the Big Boxes are hard to beat but they're also expensive, massive, and, when you start adding in all the modules, a pain to keep organized and suss out all the rules. 

H&G distills a lot of the good things about other Carc games in a more manageable, straightforward package.

The different methods of scoring are better balanced than in the original (at least in its unexpanded form), producing fewer runaway victories.  However, the sequel's emphasis on quick, opportunistic scoring makes it a lighter, friendlier game with less scope for long-term strategy.  I'm happy to play either version, but I prefer the greater depth and the better graphic design of the original.

Of course since then I purchased the original and a few expansions. Mucho fun.

Enjoy better than normal Carc, but can't fault either.  This one is easier to teach, and has more "fun" graphics.  I like the nugget and bonus tiles, despite being maybe a bit unbalancing.  Good for fun play, not for people who must have perfectly calibrated balance at all times.

RATING: 10
A great addition to the Carcassonne family.  If you don't have any Carcassonne games, I'd suggest the original for lighter gamers, or this one for more strategic gamers.  All of the games in the series are excellent; this one is more complex.  The game plays fairly differently than the original Carcassonne, actually: scoring is much more frequent, the board takes on a much different shape, and it's more unpredictable (no counting tiles).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Another good take off on a good original game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It has the familiar Carcassonne engine, but with a few added tweaks that improve the game. There are bonus tiles that are earned whenever a player completes a forest containing a gold nugget (which is nearly every forest that consists of more than two tiles). These tiles are usually quite good, but the benefit of an extra placement is also great. The field scoring is based on edible animals, not completed forests. This not only makes it easier to score, but you can also hurt a player's score by placing tiles with tigers (which negate some points).

Overall, a very nice take on Carcassonne that plays quickly and is a solid light-middleweight game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The same Carcassonne gameplay with an easier scoring system and a couple of extra tweaks that improve it overall. Still quick and simple, and a good deal of fun.

Merged duplicate entry:
Uses the same familiar Carcassonne engine, but provides a different feel. The addition of bonus tiles makes a big difference, although some of them seem pretty powerful.

The artwork is busier than the original, but you get used to it pretty quickly.

Overall, I think it is a good, solid addition to the Carcassonne family.

Many people love this game and I just don't know why. In Domino you have more tiles to choose from and in Drakon you have much more interaction with the other players. In Carcassonne there are no real choices to make, because the best position for the tile is usually obvious. The tile drawing is completely random. I had to play it many times since it was published, but the boredom I felt from the beginning remained until now.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.25
This game is very similar to the original, but I find it better, as there are more options in this game. It´s also a bit more nasty due to the tigers.

I think I like it better than carcassonne: the original series.  Mainly because the "field" scoring isn't based on the "city" scoring, as it is in carcassonne.

It's taken the best mechanic ideas from the original Carcassonne and some of the expansions, then balanced them really nicely into one box that doesn't need you to splash any more cash for. My perfect version, as it stops me spending more money on it!

RATING: 9
Out of the box this one is better than the original. Easier and quicker. Recommended for 2-4 players and not too long playing time. For a longer game (or 6 players) choose original with the first two expansions.

Some people like it better than Carcassonne, but I'm annoyed by the limited number of meeples (only 5!), and the game-breaking nature of the stonehenge bonus tile (which allows one player to automatically win a field).  Overall, I like the original Carcassonne for the breadth and variety of its expansions.

One point of strategy:  you should always try to get both fishing huts on the board, and on separate lake systems, because getting some points per hut is better than none!

Every Carcassonne provides a somewhat different experience while keeping the same core mechanics. Of all of the first wave of "spin-offs," Hunters and Gatherers might be the best for newer players to the hobby who want to grow with the game. H&G is not only easier to comprehend than vanilla Carc (as the "farmer" scoring is far easier to count; no scoring for unfinished features), but it also has a bit more in terms of offering interesting incentives: no longer are the "road" tiles second fiddle to the "castle" tiles (only simply slightly less reliable), there is a bonus for closing "castles" (i.e., bonus tiles) so there is now reason to close off features of opponents, and there are also tiles which negatively affect the valuation of "famer's fields." 

While I still might prefer the added working parts of the City, or Vanilla with a few expansions, I can safely say that without a doubt C:H&G is definitely a fantastic Carcassonne to play when you want to get right into the experience.

Amy got this for me for my Birthday. (2008)  Now we can play it at home, and we can use the Scout Expansion that comes w/ the King for Basic Carcassonne.

---

We bought this for Keith and CJ for Christmas '07.  I wanted the game but couldn't justify owning another game in the series.  We were able to play it the same night and this is a great game in the series.

I really enjoyed the aesthetic quality of the game.  It is softer and more naturalistic.  I also enjoyed the gameplay.  You start with less meeples, but you also have fishing huts to work with.  

Fields are scored more like Ark of the Covenant, but there are 4 kinds of animals instead of two.  

Cities are replaced with forests and scored the same.  (The shield icons are now mushrooms in the forest)  
Streams replace roads, but end at springs and at lakes.  In addition to scoring one point per stream segment, you get an additional point for each fish on the ends of the stream.

Like one of my favorite elements of Traders and builders, you are motivated to finish other people's Forests, because forests with a gold nugget in them entitle the person who completes the forest to a bonus tile from a separate stack.  These are better than average tiles.

The new elements are really well done.  Great variation on the same theme.

Wow, a sequel that outshines the original significantly. Great fun, great replay value, great depth.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is an easy, and clean version of Carcassonne.  It has the advantage of "Nuggets" io the forest to those who complete a forest and "fishing huts" in rivers for those who are building rivers.  Both of these give a player incentive to finish features that are not their own.  The board itself is clean, clear, and fairly easy to use.  I recommend this for anyone who plays enough Carcassonne to want the diferent theme, or someone who wants just one Carcassonne game without the pressure of expansions.  

Downside: this does not have the variability of the original Carcassonne after all the expansions.  Also, I find the two games similiar enough that I won't pack them both, and so my Hunters stays on the self.  It's not that It is a better or worse game, just that it is less flexible.

It's way more balanced than the original game, making all aspects of the game a viable way of winning. On the other hand, the wider array of different tiles, the somewhat harder to see art and the extra "luck" factor that the special tiles add makes the game less enjoyable IMO.

Very Good Game (like to play and never will turn it down).

Among the best of the "Euro" "Gateway Games" to get non-gamers to play games. Pretty much everyone that I've introduced to it loves it. 

"Hunters and Gatherers" is better (more streamlined) than the regular Carcassonne so I don't bother with the standard one anymore.

Too bad there isn't another colour of Meeple & hut so could play with 6 people.

It's a petty grievance, but I can't stand the art.  In "real" [i]Carc[/i] the art is simple and services the picture entire.  The art in [i]Hunters[/i] is fussy and indistinct; instead of ending up with a map of the game at the end, you get a big, blurry scribble.  Call me shallow, call me the-toothpick-counting-guy-who-buys-his-underwear-at-Kmart...  but I found the art far too distracting to enjoy the game.  For multiplayer I far and away prefer real [i]Carc[/i] to this.  If you're stuck with two players, [i]The Castle[/i] is the best of the series.

A slight letdown from the original Carcassonne.  I last played this as a two player game and it will probably play different with more.  The mechanics are similar to the original Carcassonne, except there's a different theme and several twists (bonus cards and huts).  Since it plays so similar to the original, you probably wouldn't want to play these games back to back, etc.  It's fairly easy to explain and learn and can be a lot of fun.

I've been waiting for this to come back into print ever since I started playing Carcassonne.  And finally, here it is!  I don't know if it was as awesome as I was expecting, but it is a great stand-alone Carcassonne.  It's similar enough to the base game, but changes things up enough to be an enjoyable change of pace. Glad to have this in my collection.

This version fixes most of the problems with the base Carcassonne, but you can do the same by just adjusting a handful of rules.
About the only interesting addition are the gold nuggets, which make it potentially worthwhile to finish other people's "castles" (forests, in this case).

We bought this game for our daughter, but I think regular  Carcassonne is easier to get than this one. I like the bonus tiles, but we love the fights over cities so much we hardly ever play this game.

2009-update. She is six now and she loves the theme. We play 50 points to shorten it a bit. The theme is much better than building cities and roads for children I guess. 

2013 I like the game but I need others to play and everybody likes Carcassonne better. Sold it.

I'm starting to notice a trend with the 10's I give out.  They're almost all entirely my favorite couple's games to play with my significant other (can ya' blame me?).

H&G is the best Carcassonne I've played yet.  It's certainly more eye-pleasing than the others and has the most streamlined scoring mechanics with just enough flair added in the bonus tiles.  I really like the theme a lot too, much better than building an old city with farms and what not (snore).  We tend not to pay much attention to score since the game is more fun to play as a means than to play as an ends.  H&G has single-handedly got me looking at the other better themed Carcassonnes.  Great game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Better then the original? Yes it is! Ever draw a road tile in Carcassonne and say "Oh great, ANOTHER stupid road." That does not happen in hunters and gatherers. The fish in the rivers (roads) make these tiles just as valuable as forests (cities). Also the extra turn mechanic from traders and builders is built right in! AND you can get a TON of points from a hunter (farmer) if you play your tiles right! If I want a long game of Carcassonne I go for the original and expansions, but most of the time I just play this.

Gotta admit, this is one cool carcassonne variant.  I really like the change from roads to rivers, the fish make all the difference for me.

I do admit that the color palette was a somewhat poor choice.  After you're done, it just doesn't look quite as cool as the original carcassonne.

All-in-all though, I think this was a noticeable improvement over the original carcassonne, even when you include the original expansions.

12-2007 Update: It still just isn't as much fun.  You're not building a countryside, instead you're "exploring" the wilderness.  It's a small distinction, but it's important.

Aug10:  Hell.  I bought the thing again.  And ya know what?  I liked it.  Heh.

A more complex base game than the original, which I consider a plus. 

The objective features (forests, rivers, fields) are similar enough to the original game's that the differences might throw you off at first, but ultimately I find them more satisfying and intuitive to build.

The presence of the megalith tile can make the game more cut-throat, which is both a plus and a minus in my view.

Everyone on the Geek raved and raved about Carc and its progeny.

My wife and I both found it to be very DRYYYYY and dull.  I really wanted to like it as it was one of my first Eurogame purchases.  Unfortunately, it flopped rather badly.

Initial Rating: 3.5  (November 2011)

I really hate Carcassonne. I did from the very beginning and, worse, I cannot explain why. It is an irrational hate for me, but it is very real nonetheless. Due to this, it is no wonder I also hate this spinoff which is very similar.

I first played this game a long time ago (more than 4 years) so I don’t remember much about it, only that I really disliked the lack of strategic choices. The game has lots of uncontrollable luck.

As my desire to play Carcassonne Carcassonne: Hunters and Gatherers is so low, I’m rating it the same I currently rate the parent game. For me, it is an extremely annoying game that I won’t ever play again.

Current Rating: 2.5

Lay tiles to extend regions, occupy the regions with your man, compete for dominance of the high value regions, score the points when the region is complete.

Even though it's a "my turn / your turn" game, once the players are familiar (coupla games) the turns are usually quick enough not to feel like down time.  Most enjoyable with people who are not highly possessive.

RATING: 5
Tigers are neat, but the direct player conflict they bring in is a turnoff.  Volcano tiles were interesting.

RATING: 6.5
A twist on original Carcassonne.  Felt a little more luck based than the original.  The Henge tile can prove very powerful.  The extra tile for completing a Forest with gold in it seemed to play well.  Would play again, but in no hurry to.

My wife wasn't in a good mood when we started this one, which may have swayed her opinion, but she doesn't seem anxious to give this another shot anytime soon. I felt like she never really got the mechanics of this kind of game and really didn't understand any of the strategy by the end of the game.

RATING: 5
Take Carcassonne, add a bunch of confusing animal graphics, make the board harder to read, make the rules way more difficult than necessary, and you are starting to get Hunters and Gatherers.  This game is not necessary in my opinion unless you're looking to have a splitting headache.  The original Carc is just fine as it is and does a fine job scratching the "tile laying" itch.  Just play that instead.  Meh.

RATING: 6.5
The lower variety of pieces, and the bonus tiles, make this game (in my experience) slightly more enganging and casual-friendly than Caracassonne, but a bit less engaging for gamers.

Pros:
- Easier on casual/non-gamers than Caracassone

Cons:
- No expansions
- Strategy is a more shallow than Carcassone

This is my first owned board game.

The game is the least frequent one that i play. It doesn't hit the table so often. Now, it mostly at my g/f's.

Honestly, this is those light casual game that you should bring to introduce your casual gamer friend to the board game world. It is light and easy. It also has MEEPLES on it. The scoring track and those 50 marker has an accomplishment feels to it.

But it's just doesn't scratch any itch in my gaming needs >.

They did clean up some things in this game  (farms)from the basic Carcassonne and did provide incentive to close off other players forests both of which were improvements. However I don't like the appearance of the game and it's many shades of green, the board just looks too cluttered to me.

2015-04-17: Initial rating as 7. Although I played regular Carcassonne by myself on the iOS app version, I've never played an actual physical copy of the game. I played it with 3 other players who have never seen the game at all. 1 out of the 3 seemed to really get it right away, but it did seem to take some time for people to get their brain around "the puzzle."

Carcassonne was my entry to both modern boardgames and BGG, and is still in my Top 10. I've never been that into checking this version out, because I always assumed it was just kind of a re-theme. But, they don't have the original on Yucata so I tried this one out. It's so much more than a re-theme! It's like it takes the basic framework or premise of Carc, but changes the rules so much that it plays like a totally different game. You've got added tension of incomplete structures at the end (hints of Inns & Cathedrals but applied globally), and the meadows ("farms") are completely transformed due to different wild game and the offensive power of tigers. There's also the small stack of bonus tiles that give you some cool new fire-power and encourage you to finish other people's forests (hints of Traders and Builders but with bonus power twist). Rivers ("roads") are made much more powerful thanks to the presence of fish, and to fishing huts, and I like the tension of having fewer meeples to put out (5).

I do like Doris Matthäus's art on the original better than Johann Rüttinger's on Hunters and Gatherers, so I knock it 0.5 for that down to 9.5 (I rate vanilla Carc 10), since the aesthetic finished landscape is an important element for me.

But, this game's rules and strategy are so different and interesting, it absolutely deserves a spot on my game-shelf next to the original.

Sad to hear this one is OOP but I hope that it is only a temporary thing due to the RGG/HiG divorce and that Z-Man will come out soon with their own reprint. 

UPDATE: This game is so brilliant, and such an interesting "twist" and change from basic Carc, that I am upgrading my rating to 9.8.  Still gotta dock it 0.2 points since I prefer the art in Carc :-)

Two-player high score, no sacred shrine: 210.

For the time being I prefer that version to the classic Carcassonne without expansions. Haven't played any expansions though.

Hunters & Gatherers doesn't feel as confrontational but this is probably deceiving. The new element of gold and cards you get for finishing forests make the game a bit more constructive. Same goes for the huts.

Great stand-alone version of Carcassonne - a little bit more going on than regular carc, and pulling it out avoids requests for playing with expansions which, in the case of regular carc, drastically increase the playtime beyond what is justified for this type of game

RATING: 8
I have only played the original carcasonne and this. I personally prefer this to the original while my son prefers the original. The diferences are minimal, both are easy to pick up and both require some strategy in tile placement. Both also depend heavily on lucky tile draws, if your drawing crap that's what you'll have at the end of the game.

Hunters and Gatherers fixes my issues with vanilla Carcassonne. Roads/River tiles are now worth drawing! The fishing huts are a blast and it's enjoyable to get bonus tiles even if you finish someone else's forest (similar to Traders and Builders exp for base game). It is a distilled version of Carcassonne that takes the best mechanics and places them in a single game. It's also a plus to me that there are not 100 expansions to mess with. Lastly, I prefer the stone age theme much more, but color scheme could be updated if they reprint - it's a bit washed out but it grows on you.

My wife and I  find it mildly amusing and a little dull.  Not my cup of tea but I'd play it again.

The more I play it, the more I like it. Great tile variety, though it seems to suffer from Meeple-lock more than the original, with only 5 meeples to place. Still, although I still love the simplicity of the original Carcassonne, this is very much beginning to pass the original in my book...

Way better than the original. The theme is beautiful and unique unlike its counterpart. The complexity is in the tiles which the original lacked. You could buy expansion for the original but all that would do is clutter the game and expand the runtime, inflating the board size. H&G is great without any need for expansions. I just hate the tile that allows you to steal another persons hunting territory. I contemplate burning that tile.

Fantastic as 2-player game; during the first 75 games, the strategy and decisions never grew stale.  ... After 75 games, the situations were not so new any more, and the game is a bit more like a pleasant pastime now.  But still, that was some amazing staying power!  ... After 150 games, it's pleasant, but we've moved to fresher games.  I still wouldn't say no to a game.

A little better than the original Carcassonne.

We eventually started using a hand of 2 tiles; we should have done this long ago.

RATING: 9
Easily my most played game. Somewhat on the light side, but still good fun after ~80 (5 years on: 300+ ) playings or so.

H&G improves on the original Carcassonne in just about every way, including theme. If you'll only get one Carcassonne, make it this one; the bonus tiles feels like a built-in expansion & the huts really bring another strategic parameter into it. Also, the lesser amount of meeples increases the amount to strategy & makes you think twice before placing another hunter. Further, the tile mix is well thought out and balanced. 

House rules: I use the 3-4-5 points each progression scale for scoring multiple Aurochs in a single meadow. 

Also, I strongly recommend doing the math and removing tiles depending on # of players so that everyone gets the same amount of turns (this also limits the benefit of "tile-counting"). Don't know why this tweak isn't in the rules already!

Nowadays this doesn't hit the table among "us gamers" quite as often, but it still is the Euro of choice to introduce to new aquaintances(sp?). It works well to relax and slow down after a hectic work day, and does not seem to get old at al. Raised my rating to a solid 9. Kudos!

Terrific game, excellent concept and beautifully executed with the quality of components and artwork. Easy enough to play with children and non-gamers, but with enough tactical and planning elements to appeal to regular game-players. A winner all around.

Update 10/09: Have downgraded my rating to 7. While I still think this is a terrific game for new gamers interested in non-mass-market games, and unlike the original Carcassonne can adequately stand on its own, the novelty has worn off to the point where a game can get tedious and drawn-out. If it is played as a cut-throat game, it turns out better, but if players aren't too keen on trying to block other players' scoring opportunities, it can be dull.

Great family game with 2 or more people.  Easy and simple, but not very deep.  An improvement over the original Carcassonne (even with the expansions added) in my opinion - the meadows are more intuitive than the farm land in the original game.  Plus the ability to sabotage other player's meadows with tigers is a lot of fun.  Of all the iterations, I think this one is the best.  No expansions necessary.

The best of the Carcassonne series. It is so much fun to see the topography evolve and the special tiles are great added variant rules. This is the most strategic of the Carcassonne series, imo, because the special tiles and huts add a lot of variety. I suppose its missing a double score dude, and six players and expansions, but that doesn't necessarily limit its quality. The 2 player games I played last night though didn't work as well for some reason. It's also my favorite of the Carcassonne series, with the forest topography being created before your eyes and animals to hunt.

Maybe it is because I played the original game first and more often, but this version has never grabbed me. On a superficial level, it is nowhere near as attractive as the original version, and now that I am used to the (admittedly clumsy) farmer scoring, the hunter scoring doesn't feel right to me. The bonus tiles are a nice touch, but the downside is the forests always feel too small. I know I should like this more, but I just don't, and I don't have a good reason why.

I don't mind conflict etc in games but I do feel that any game that is so based on luck of the tile draw should not allow for 1 lucky/unlucky draw to have a 30+ point swing just because your boyfriend pulled a couple tiles that let him steal your well build meadow.

Prefer this a bit more than the original basic game.  H&G usually serves as a better Gateway game since non-gamers usually don't understand the basic farmer scoring rules (can cities get counted twice, etc.) whereas the 2 endgame scores, the hut networks and animal meadows, are easier to calculate.

I played original Carcassonne when I started my investigation into eurogames.  I found it charming, but lacking the depth to make me want to return to it.  People assured me that the game improved with expansions, but I didn't like the idea adding more tiles and more rules to enjoy what should be a simple game.  As such it took me five years to check out _Hunters and Gatherers_, but I'm glad I did.

H&G fixes just about everything I disliked about Carcassonne.  In original Carc the game seemed to devolve into a battle of the Farmers, with all other meeple types to be opportunistic and secondary.  Here the "farmers" are hunters, who only score points for the number of wild game in the fields.  These can be limited by tile placements, as well as chased away by tigers.  Hunters are also weaker because players are given only five meeples instead of Carcassonne's 8, so each placement is more critical in this game.  The other meeple types have been strengthened, too:  robbers are now fishermen, who score additional points for the fish in lakes, and knights are now gatherers, and completion of their forests gives players the chance at playing bonus tiles.  As such, this is a much more balanced and strategically interesting game than its predecessor.

I really enjoy this as a 2-player, although I find it helps to abbreviate the game by removing 10 to 16 tiles at the start.  Four-players is probably a bit too many, and I expect this to play well with three but I have yet to try it.  This one's a keeper.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Like Stone Age this game works best when the players are keen and experienced. The Hunters and Gatherers variation compares favorably to standard Carcassonne due to its simplification of farmer/hunters scoring, increase in points for roads/rivers and decrease in reliance of cities/forests.

I prefer this version to standard Carcassonne with the added bonus of not having to fight with other players over exactly what expansions will be included in the game play.

This game is another version of Carcassonne that I play regurlary.

We finally got [thing=4390]Hunters and Gatherers[/thing] in a trade and we were eager to try it out, particularly as it's praised for being better than the original base game.  It has some good ideas---I liked the new Field scoring as well as the Tiger mechanism.  On the other hand, the Huts scoring feels a little weird and tacked on.  Plus, the tile distribution feels off---we ended up scoring many small 2-3 tile rivers over and over again rather than building longer rivers, unlike the longer roads in Carcassonne.  This made the flow of the game feel more interrupted.  However, the hardest thing for us was the color palette---the different shades of green were just too similar for us to quickly identify the different features on the tiles.  Overall, I think Hunters and Gatherers is probably better than base Carcassonne, but Carcassonne plus expansions is still the best for us.

This might deserve a higher rating if we didn't have the original Carcassonne available, but since we do and we find the gameplay of the original far preferable, there you go. Somehow there seems to be less planning and more quick-and-random point grabs in this one.

Although I gave this a 10 because it is an excellent game, if you already have the original Carcassonne I wouldn't recommend buying it since it is practically the same game.  The differences are very subtle, roads are now rivers, cities are now forests, farms are now meadows.  Yes, there are a few minor differences about they way they are scored and a few other minor differences between the two games, but it's not enough to make it worth buying if you already have the original.  If you don't have the original or hunters and gathers, I would strongly recommend buying one of them as they are both excellent games for both casual and hardcore gamers.

RATING: 7
Much simpler than City, much better than Castle. Fairly quick.

The rivers/fish are an interesting mechanism, and a boon to players who like Carcassonne but are hindered with less-than-stellar spacial awareness, as considered against farms in particular. The gold adds an uber random element that can be fun or annoying.

I liked playing this best with a 'hand' of 3 tiles, which made the game move much faster for me since I don't take the time to examine every possibility as I do with a single tile. This is the only Carcassonne game which I enjoy with a 'hand'. A different game with the hand (more strategy), but lite colorful (green) fun either way.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
This, to me, is the definitive version of Carcassonne.  It has enough different ideas to feel fresh to a seasoned Carcassonne player, without being overly complicated or taking long to explain.  

It's also the perfect length, at around 45min, never overstaying its welcome.  To get a similar density rule-set from the base game using expansions, you'd end up lengthening the game substantially via all of the extra expansion tiles.

Same tile aspect as the original, different and more strategic scoring.  My recent observation is that this varient lends more frequent tides of winning/losing to the game.  It's easier to steal all of someone's thunder, so it can bite you if you're too aggressive at the beginning. Some of my friends prefer it to classic Carcassonne.  It's really a toss up for me.

In many respects, H&G is my preferred form of Carc (even though I own the original!).  I like the cleaner scoring of the hunting grounds (over the farms of the original), the addition of the bonus tiles and the hut v fisherman decision.  A couple of the bonus tiles are a little too much - Uber-Hunter and the Scares-Away-All-Tigers one.  Especially together.  But I like that it is perfectly self-contained and has no need of expansion - good as it is.

Ken:
Good, as far as the Carcassonne series goes.  Works well with 2.  Found the gameplay to be rather limiting and deterministic after a few plays.  I'm simply not a fan of Carcassonne's simplistic tile laying and meeple placement.

Would be willing to play again.  No chance of future re-acquisition.

I did not like this as much as the C:  The Castle.  The theme was bleh.  I found the mechanics rather frustrating at that early point in my gaming experience - this title's hut placement was a particular sore point.

seems to be a better version of Carcassonne. Not worth getting considering how many versions of this game I have.

Slightly more complex than the original Carcassonne, but this game feels tighter than Carcassonne plus expansions. This is definitely a more tactical game, with fewer big-scoring events in the game, the focus is more on getting smaller sums of points more often. I can't be certain, but I suspect this has a more varied tile mix than the original, which makes counting tiles and calculating odds a little trickier - could just be my lack of familiarity however.

Its a well put together and interesting game, but I prefer games where you can plan ahead to some extent, rather than just randomly draw a tile and play it. Also, no chance to plan ahead means people take a long time with their turns.

[2-5] An excellent re-themed Carcassonne. Might even be better than Carcassonne as I enjoy it without any expansions. This version has more diversity in the tile layouts (something that comes with the expansions in the basic game), but a sufficient amount of tiles so that the game doesn't last too long.

Scoring seems more balanced and players are encouraged to build large river complexes with a new clever way to score them with an additional game piece (a hut). Meadow (=field) scoring is more straight forward as you get points from animals printed on the tiles instead of castles.

Esta es una modalidad interesante de este juego, agrega nuevos espacios y complejidad.Me gusta, pero estoy en descuerdo con el uso  la tableta del santuario. El jugador puede perder el  control de una gran  área de caza , de manera fortuita. La verdad es  mejor dejar el juego balanceado y remover la tableta.

A surprisingly different version of Carcassonne - much more "brutal" than the original. The fields seem particularly important to winning the game, which leads to some fierce battles. I love the temple tile, which can really frustrate this quest, but my wife hates it. The ability to draw a special tile when completing a forest is a particularly interesting rule. Overall, highly recommended for Carcassone fans, but probably not quite up the standards of the original.

Great well paced game with a good scoring system. Rivers (equivalent to roads) give better scores, especially with huts.

Games usually last an hour which is a good length and it is very enjoyable to play. 

Little to fault other than a bag could have been provided for drawing tiles, but they are cheap so not too much of a problem.

My favourite Carcassonne game.

Record score: 230

RATING: 6
One of the better variants of Carcassonne to my opinion. Just because the tiles look very colorful and not always very clear. But that forces you to be very concentrated and adds tension to the game.
I have always found the look of the original carcassonne very boring. This variant doesn't look boring at all.

This is the only Carcassonne game I own.  It's fantastic for playing with my wife or with house guests who aren't gamers.  It allows me to get my gaming fix when I am surrounded by non-gamers, so even the high luck factor involved in tile drawing can't shake my love of it

7-6-11-Just played this with Casey and reread the rules for clarification on a few points--obviously we had been playing wrong on a couple of points, so future games should play better and we will actually be able to complete (and know that we have!) a meadow.  Duh!
Yes, this game is great, I should always remember to periodically check to make sure we are playing correctly after a few games.  

We still don't have a handle on this gateway game.  I never can figure out how to get a meadow and the one time Miles did he only managed to get 4 points out of it!  We'll keep trying though. 

Gave this to Anne (Sarah) for their mom's birthday. We never wanted to play it. Probably gave it to them a couple of years ago, maybe even 2014.

Ce jeu reprend un certain nombre de mécanismes du premier carcassone, notamment la pose de tuile et le placement de pions. Le thème est par contre totalement différent: on se retrouve maintenant à la préhistoire!

Les joueurs vont placer tour à tour des tuiles paysages et installer éventuellement un de leurs pions sur un des élèments de la tuile posé si celui-ci n'appartient pas déjà à quelqu'un. Les élèments des tuiles sont de 4 types: forêt, rivière, plaine et lac.

2-5p, 45m.  This was the second game I played after Settlers of Catan.  It is simpler to learn than Settlers of Catan, but just as engaging.  Even more mellow with the co-opetition.  The lack of dice is nice.  I originally rated it higher when we played it constantly for several weeks during breaks at work.  But eventually we seemed to have "played it out."  I got the Scout expansion, but it was too late, and hasn't been played recently.  Not that it is bad, just that there are other more interesting, newer games to explore.

3 / 5 - Good.

Mechanically this might actually be more interesting than Carcassonne: the endgame scoring makes more sense, and the "hunters" with their prey and tigers to compete with are a lot more interesting than farmers. The thematic touches - like the forest fire and magic mushrooms - are funny. However I find the pieces really, really ugly and visually confusing as well. Rivers end when it looks like they carry on, and forests carry on when it looks like they should end. I'm probably just too used to staring at vanilla Carcassone tiles.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
My favorite Carcassone variant.

I like the bonus tiles for completing forests with 'gold' in them. This creates an incentive to build other people's forest.

I go from periods of indifference to absolute fascination with this simple tile-laying game.  Great with even 2-players.  Rules need to be tweaked so that players take a new tile at the end of their turn instead of the start.  This helps speed up play and reduce down-time w/no other adverse effects.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I'm of two minds about this game.

On one hand, it's a great spin on Carcassonne that stands on it's own. The hunting feels a little off though; like they couldn't figure out what to do with the farmers from Carc, so they implemented a counting game on top of an otherwise excellent game.

They tweaked Carcassonne so that forests (same as cities) get finished more often, and so that rivers (roads) are more meaningful. The tradeoff is that it's slightly more complicated to score and to learn. I think it's still just as swingy.

This works for people who already know how to play regular Carc but think it would be more fun if the cities got finished more and there were more mammoths.

Carcassonne: Hunters & Gatherers ("Hunters") is a standalone version of the classic tile-laying Carcassonne, (designer Klaus-Jürgen Wrede), and was released in 2002.  Hunters stands out as a game that strikes a paradoxical balance between its outward appearance and accessibility as a light game and its hidden and genuine depth that can sustain many repeat plays.  Hunters’ mechanics are straightforward yet flexible enough to foster good tensions and a competitive edge throughout the entire game.

Great for 2-players.  Read the full review here:

The best iteration of Carcassonne in my opinion. The randomising element of the gold nugget tiles helps level the playing field against those who would memorise the tile manifest in Carcassonne. 

Scoring of fields is easier and more intuitive, 50 point+ scoring markers are included in the box. Scales well with muggles and gamers. Find a copy.

Excellent version of Carcassonne! I feel this game is even tighter than the base game - first of, incomplete features don't score except for fields (farms) and river systems (roads, but not quite), and you have less meeples.  Evaluating short vs. long term rewards is also made more tricky as things are bundled closer in terms of points (I felt castles and farms dominated over roads and chapels which were more opportunistic in the base game) - here rivers, fields and forests all have a relatively close scoring. I like the added levels of interaction where you can complete a forest (city) to get a bonus tile, even if you don't score the forest in question, and you can add tigers to fields to make them be worth less.

The only real minus is the overly "green" look to it all. It's quite nice in terms of art, but parsing the board at a glance is much harder here. Not a problem, but I think it adds some to the playtime as people have to go over the whole thing a bit more.

A great game!

An excellent variation of the original game. I get the impression that the publisher and designer learnt a lot when Carcassonne was released and that this version is the result. It feels like this version is the beneficiary of further development and refinement.

RATING: 5
After 42 plays. I usually play Carcassonne two players. My favorite version for 2 players is Carcassonne: The Castle (by Knizia), though I haven't played The City, which I think I might also like. 

This one is ok. It was good at first, and very pretty on the table (probably the prettiest Carc) but now it's feeling flat. Feels too choice-limited and completing forests seems so critical that turns on which I can do so are often auto-plays. Also, the Sacred Shrine is so unbalanced we leave it out of the game, so my rating is for the game with the Shrine removed. 

Opinion could change with deeper play and more study, but hard it's to get motivated to study this kind of game, so probably won't happen.

The game is interesting, much like the original. The main difference are the bonus cards you get for creating a city/forest that has a gold nugget in it. And now the fields score for the animals in them, which get hunted by sabertooths. One major qualm I have is one of the bonus tiles, The Holy Shrine. It allows 1 player, to win majority in the field it is placed in with a meeple. So basically it&#039;s this giant luck factor that&#039;s thrown into the game, it&#039;s not very good at the end of the game but terribly powerful early on.

This is the first Euro/German game I bought and played. It will forever hold a special place in my heart. Not all my plays are reflected to the left. I really like this with only two players. Much more room to gain points and not get screwed over by my opponent. Plus, I think it plays more quickly due to less players being involved and bogging it down with AP.

Last played: January 2008.

Carcassonne H&amp;G is a massively addictive game.  I&#039;ve been a board gamer for quite some time (long before boards existed - we carved lines in the ground and stood between them for fun - okay, I&#039;m not quite that old), and I know that Carcassonne WILL bring attention to board games from &quot;the masses.&quot;  I&#039;ve already introduced this game to several people that now are INTO board games again.  I tell them they&#039;re not geeky for converting over, but that&#039;s our little secret.  If you already own the original Carcassonne, H&amp;G is a very close relative in gameplay and appearance.  It&#039;s different enough for me to justify buying it separately.  I play both equally, but most all of my normal gaming group likes the original better.  Quick games, varying gameboard, lots of strategy, some luck - well done.

RATING: 7
Definitely much better than base Carcasonne -- the choices feel more meaningful, and the bonuses less random and more aligned with actual gameplay. I also really like the idea of the tigers -- tiles that can remove the bonuses that another player's 'farmer' meeples have accumulated.

The differences between this and the original Carcassonne highlight the latter's deficiencies. This is the superior game - the fish add another dimension (namely, fish), the bonus tiles up the tension, and trying to link fields is somehow tenser here too. Also good for newbs.

Yes, the shrine is overpowered, but you don't have to play with it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
If you want just one Carcassonne game and no expansions then this might be it. I actually prefer the artwork of this one (ooh! fishies!). Also, the hunters counting the animals on their meadow makes much more sense than counting completed cities. The gold and the extra tiles act as a sort-of expansion already.

Why just a rating of 6? Well, I find it too simplistic after all and I prefer games where I build something, or collect or trade something, or fight battles or...

My favorite Carcassonne. The meeple roles are much more balanced than in the original game and the interactions more strategic without the necessity of a bunch of expansions that each add two or three new rules. It teaches in 5 minutes and provides that light strategic experience that never halts conversation. It's the distillation of the series to its most basic parts, exemplifying the mechanics that make the series great.

Nice pace to game, parts colorful and well done. My first game, we helped each other into points trying to learn game. My son took the lead at start, i over took the lead 1/3 into game. About 2/3 into game he took the lead again and never looked back.  Near the last 1/4 of game, i drew the temple tile, our meadows were huge, mine was one tile away from becoming his. I managed to link the meadows together with my last tile placement. Any game that comes down to winning game on last turn rates high in my books, though i do feel that temple card is overly  powerfull.

Whilst the original may have some expansions to improve on the original game, for me Hunters and Gatherers is the best stand alone multi-player Carcassonne game on the market.

The fields which offer animals are far more interesting than the farmers concept, the river system with the fish and hut consideration is excellent and the inclusion of a bonus draw tile pile is a little gem.

A game that I don't own but really should. Highly recommended for anyone looking for their 1st Carcassonne game and having multiple friends.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This was a fresh blow of wind. I hadn't played the original game in years and although I've tried only one of the expansions, the woody theme of Hunters & Gatherers pleases me more than the boring Middle Ages. Also, as the original combined with one or several expansions drags on for way too long, this one is pleasantly short. 

But the thing I hated most about the original, namely the fields, is even more potent a weapon here, because the visuals are somewhat garbled. So it requires some tactics, lots of visual recognition and finally luck to get the right pieces for the fields.

I picked up the original Carcassonne game, but it's just not as good as this version.

My first in the Carcassonne series, and I like it a lot.  Play it quietly or agressively depending on the mood and the fellow players, so that's great that there's more than 1 way to enjoy it.  Nice mix of long term strategy weighed against the temptation of immediate scoring, represented by the choice of when to put huts and hunters, opposed to scoring immediately with fishermen and gatherers.  Overall good tile laying game that definitively makes me curious about the other Carcassonne games as well...

This is like playing the original with one or two of the expansions thrown in, so in that respect good value for money. Obviously getting the 'blue' Carc will allow you more flexibility of those extras. On balance I prefer the original - I like the clarity of the graphics on the original too.
Update to that - I prefr the artwork of the original - but if you want to buy one box - get this one - it's a better game.

RATING: 7.5
A good game and certainly a great game to introduce non-gamers to Euro games as the scoring rules are somewhat simpler than regular Carcassonne but I still prefer the original for it's better(IMO) artwork and slightly higher potential for strategy.

Carcassonne isn't the deepest strategy game ever but it has won its place in homes thanks to its simplicity and variability. I mostly own it as a useful introduction to the board gaming world, but it still defends itself pretty well when compared to other gateway games (especially with 2 players). Hunters and Gatherers is a more complicated Carcassonne and I wonder who its public is nowadays:
- If you want to introduce people to the board gaming world, regular Carc is less convoluted.
- If you love the original game and want more of it, it now has a bazillion expansions that do basically the same job as H&G; and you have the option not to use them or to select which ones you like.
- If you want to play a more involved game, there's all the non-Carcassonne awaiting you.

If your playing partner is not into confrontation then this is a good way to introduce them to it.

Though I prefer 'Carcassonne the City' H&G probably gets the most play of the series for me.  This is the best introductory game of the Carc series.  I prefer H&G very much to the Blue Box Carcs.  if you are new to the series I would recommend getting H&G first then move up to the City.

This version seems a cleaner than the original particularly with respect to the 'farmers'.  It is much easier to teach, and count (the amount of livestock in the fields vs. bordering cities), and being able to play a tiger to lower the field's value adds some decisions.

My preferred version of Carcassonne.

With two players it's a 10, with three players it's a 9.5, and with more than three it's a 8.5. In other words, the fewer the players, the more I enjoy the game as the luck of the draw is reduced. Still great fun at any time and a superb game for introducing people to the more interesting types of games that are out there (read: NOT Monopoly).

I got this edition as a solution to needing expansions to patch the base game.  People always suggest one or two additions to the base to make it better, where this version is supposed to work out of the box.  And it does and plays fine.  I like it well enough but the play one draw one feels really limiting and luck dependent. I understand its about making the most of what you draw and having a hand of tiles is really AP inducing.  But I think having 2 tiles at a time would be a good middle ground.  The bonus tiles can be really strong and seem a bit lopsided if you get one of the few special ability tiles.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
A neat variant of Carcasonne. The field scoring is simpler, but having fewer pieces makes you have to think about your moves more. Getting your fishing hut down sooner is probably better since you won't be left out.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I like this more than the original Carcassonne. It solves most of the problems that pushed me to forget about Carcassonne:

-> Abbeys are very powerful (the are not included here)
-> The roads are close to useless. The more roads tiles you draw, the less likely you are to win. Here, the fishes make up for that, and the huts too.
-> The woods don't have shields to increase their valor, but they have nuggets that allow for extra actions.
-> The fields are too chaotic and powerful, they often decide games (especially with Traders & Builders). Here they are animals and you can control them much more. 

Overall, I like it more than the original Carcassonne game, but I'm subtracting 1 point because it's lack of originality.

I don't like the Dolmen. It's very powerful and it can destroy 1-2 meeples of a rival, meeples he cannot recover, and he only has 5!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I like Hunters & Gatherers more than original Carcassonne from out of the box. The original with Inns & Cathedrals or Traders & Builders is quite close though. H&G seems a bit more balanced and excellent playability without any expansions. 

I especially like the fact that "farms" usually are a bit smaller and give less points. Other great addition is bonus tiles you get if you happen to complete someone elses forest (aka "city"). This gives others at least some motivation to complete your forest's and you can also benefit by completing other players forest's as the bonus tiles give extra turn and they are more powerful than normal tiles.

A diverting alternative to the traditional Carcassonne, and a scoring system which is slightly preferable if anything, but this is somewhat superfluous to anyone who already owns the original and an expansion pack or two. It's not too difficult to incorporate the improved scoring into the original game yourself.

Seems much more well-rounded than the other Carc versions. Rivers (roads) appear equivalent in value to Forests (cities), and Hunters (farmers) are not over-powered. The Hut placement adds another dimension to River scoring which increases their importance.

[b]Carcassonne: Hunters and Gatherers[/b] was traded away in a math trade 3/9/16. (Received TransAmerica)

[i]Hopefully this will be the last Carcassonne variant I buy. It was fun, but when it boils down to it all of these different versions still play out very similar to vanilla Carc, which at this point is not a game I want to own or play all that often. There is a lot of hype surrounding this version, especially when it comes to playing with two, but I wasn't blown away. The addition of huts is okay and the gold tiles are okay, but out of all the variations I've played this one feels the closest to basic Carcassonne. 

If I was going to own one version of Carcassonne at this point it would be South Seas. I love how the scoring works in that version and it really changes up how you play the game. H&G is my least favorite version of played so far.[/i]

This is the first version of Carcassonne I played.  I was told that it's a good introduction to this family of games, being perhaps somewhat less complicated.  That being said, I will probably not wish to tackle any of the other versions, as I found this one to be quite complicated enough.  I felt stressed while playing, which brought down my fun factor.  I was plagued with indecision as to what I should do next.  I invariably made the wrong decision once I finally made one.  Aside from that, I have to say that the tiles are quite beautiful, and I like the idea of the game.  It just doesn't seem to be the sort of game I'm good at.  I am much more comfortable playing Wooly Bully, which is a sort of simplified version of Carcassonne.  Still, I would be willing to give it another try.  (3+3)

Update (080417)
Played with 6 year old today. Made the decision that the game is too long for my liking given its complexity. Even though there's not much decision making to be made, there are just too many tiles in the game. Granted you can just remove some tiles but I'm not sure if that would change the balance of the game. 

I'm also not so enthused by the spatial - decisions one has to make in the game. I guess tile-laying games are not my cup of tea.

Sometimes this is just the right Carcassonne game for the occasion! It is truly a beautiful game! Herding animals into your territories is quite fun and keeping the lions out of your territory provides a nice strategy to play with too! The fish points in the streams are also great to work on with the placement of the huts! Great fun!

Great game, the tile distribution is more balanced than the original edition, so you don't need to spend loads of money on expansions to fix the imbalances then further expansions to re-balance the other expansions. All for the same price of the original, sans expansions.

Carcassonne is best played as a 45 minute light game, not a 1.5 - 2 hour light game. If you add too many expansions you end up adding so much time to the game that it becomes very repetitive and outstays it's welcome.

Superb Carcassonne variant with farming replaced by hunting where the player scores for deer and woolly mammoths but loses a deer for each sabretooth tiger in his hunting ground. Robbers on roads are replaced with fishermen on rivers with river junctions being lakes where the fisherman scores bonus points for the number of fish in the lakes. Knights in cities are replaced with gatherers in forests and the player who completes a forest with a gold nugget in it gets to play an extra tile from a bonus stack.

Quality mechanic rework on the regular carcassonne.  The game is fun enough, but it loses lots of points for not being much different from the original.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Observations included:
- scoring is higher.
- the tile distribution cuts up the meadows more, making more 'farms'. These can provide decent scores when you're ready to commit your Meeple, but not the overwhelming scores of the original. It also allows the Meeple commitment to come later in the game, which is nicely achieved as you have 2 less Meeples to play with.
- I really like the bonus tile / play again system as a reward when completing a city, um, forest, and for running the risk of getting no points if you hadn't completed it.
- Rivers are more valuable than roads due to the bonuses that come with each closure, balancing the game even more.
- The Water Huts provided another commitment decision to make, this time on water systems (roads) rather than farms, which provides another element to the points now vs points long term.

In the end, it's exactly the same game system with the same pros and cons. Pick a tile. Place a tile. Commit a Meeple or save for later. But I feel no need to have both, unless it came second hand for cheap maybe.

Another Carcassonne standalone game that has some really nice, different mechanics than the original game.  My favorite thing is the bonus tiles.  You acquire them in the same way you get the goods tokens in the Traders and Builders expansion.  But, you immediately get to place one of these bonus tiles outside of your regular turn, AND they are more powerful than regular tiles!  Love them!  I also like how the fishing huts score, and how the fish play a big part in scoring the rivers.  Lastly, I like how rivers and forests don't score you any points at the end of the game if you don't finish them.  This can create some good defensive moments.  Another amazing version of Carcassonne!

Once you start including expansion tiles into regular Carcassone, it's difficult to go back and remove them. If you desire to play the original, simpler version, it is easier to grab Hunters and Gatherers and play a "no-expansion" Carc game. It looks a little different, but has only a couple of different rules, with a small tile set. Pleasent colors, nice scoring mechanism. Solid 7.

TRY Feb/04 (BSW): The colouring & scoring of the Aurochs are poorly chosen, and some of the artwork doesn't match positionally from tile-to-tile; throws off the beautiful visual perception!

Otherwise, it's very good.  Simple enough to figure out the scoring, even for kids or non-gamers.  Would be a '9' if not for the above issues, as I really enjoy the simplicity of this one.

OWN Mar/04.

Originally I liked this better than regular Carcassonne, due to its better "farmer rules."  Later regular Carc revised and improved their farmer rules, which makes this version less appealing. 

It also has several "special power" tiles which break the game.  In my last play, that turned me off more than anything.

Stick to regular Carc.

Carcassonne újragondolása az őskorban. Az új dolgok (vadállatok, halászkunyhók, bónuszlapok) nagyon feldobják, színesítik a játékot, azonban nekem még mindig az eredeti tetszik jobban.
Hátránya, hogy elég átláthatatlan a játéktér a hasonló színű lapkák miatt.

RATING: 7
A good version of Carcassonne. Nice part is that there are no expansions (don't count the little ones) to this.

Gameplay and theme both are slightly better than in Carcassonne. However, art is just so much worse than in base game. Too bad that's the way since otherwise this is a very promising game.

Carcassonne was good in the beginning, but now after too much play I find the tile draw to be too luck based.

But this version fixes some of the aspects with the base game. It's much better how the farmers work in this one.

After just one play, I think Hunters and Gatherers might be the perfect twist on Carcassonne.  I don't know that I would play it to the exclusion of regular Carcassonne, but particularly as a 2-player game, I think H&G might be superior.  The mechanics are just different enough, particularly with the hunters in the meadows, to make this a very refreshing option.  I just love trying to add animals into the meadows.  Unlike the farmers in the regular game, the hunters in the meadows make you think more about the "negative space".  The bonus tiles are a very nice twist too.

Same, same, but different! 

Klaus-Jürgen Wrede has done a really  good sequal. When I bought this game I was a bit afraid that it would only be new tiles and the same game, but it's not. It has the same basic rules of placement but a whole new scoringsystem which creates whole new strategies! There are some loopholes, so I give 9 and not 10.

Hours of fun!

An excellent Carcassonne variant to add to your rotation.

Pros:
* Gold coin mechanic gives you a reason to complete someone else's forest.
* Hunter mechanic is easier to teach than farmers in the original game.

Cons:
* Artwork is more subdued than the redone Carcassonne 2014 version.

RATING: 8
This is Carcassonne as intended. Fields just work better here, and forests are so much easier to work with than castles. Giving people incentives to finish each other's structures gives a feeling of self-interest, rather than the tacit teamwork and bargaining you had to live with before. I'm in the minority here, but I think it's better than the original.

"How many different ways *could* we have designed Carcassonne?"  Not sure I want to know.  Got this to help teach the system to the kids.  (Got the impression it was a simpler system, which I found to be only partly true.)  The art on this actually makes it *harder*, imo.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The Carcassonne system is a classic. Any the Carcassonne games are pretty much the same, just slightly different. Carcassonne, like Settlers of Catan, is a definite gateway game. Great for new players and families. This one, hunters and gatherers, is probably one of the best in the series (or The New World), as it offers a bit more by way of decisions.

RATING: 8.5
I really like this incarnation of the game. It adds some extra complexity with very subtle changes to the traditional Carcassonne. Interestingly enough, I played this version before playing the regular Carcassonne. The only complain, which seems to be well known, is the "shrine" tile, which allows an opportunistic player to take control over large hunting grounds with ease, as my boy did today. It is a cheap way to get ahead, but in his case, he was going to win anyway. Many people seem to prefer not using that particular tile, and I think we are likely to remove it from our games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.4
The mechanics it's similar to Carcassonne Classic but better, the theme of the woods it´s just different but nice and I think that, for a Carcassonne fan, it's a must have game.

Includes:
The Stone Wall (PnP Fan Expansion): A stone waal that plays and as the same function as the River Expansion for the Classic Carcassonne

Very good game, the fish in the lakes make going for rivers a viable strategy.  I like the addition of the bonus tiles, as it gives players another thing to think of (rather than just trying to score points for themselves every turn).  The game is very balanced, what Carcassonne should have been to begin with.  There's not a ton of depth though, which would cause me to get a little tired of this one if I had to play it over and over.

A step along from the original Carcassonne. IMO the original is a very good gateway game - just simple enough for non-gamesters to watch a game and ask if they could try joining in next time. H&G is 100 steps beyond the gate - probably just a little too complex to be that gateway game, but hugely intriguing for many of those who've got to that gate and are interested in what's beyond. Well I guess it's a personal preference which depends on whether the prehistoric theme grabs you, but for me it really does. For me the original soon became so straightforward that it's almost an abstract.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Mostly the same game as original Carcassonne. Roads=rivers, forests=city. Do like the bonus tile concept along with the hut scoring at the end of the game. The other difference is the hunter scoring of animals.
If I had neither I would buy this one, it is a better version to start getting people into strategy games.

This (the whole Carcassonne family of games and expansions) is the favourite game in my house. My regular group loves it. My wife will play it with me.

I think this one is better than the original Carcassone and has a higher screwage factor.
The components are great, only the forest tiles could have been better drawn in order to more clearly see whether the forests are still open or closed and whether they block meadows or not.
Anyway, it's a very tactical game with a different layout at each play which is nice.
The fewer players the better it gets.

I bought "South Ses" because "Hunters and Gatherers" was OOP. When the 2nd printing came out, I snapped it up.
 I like this much better than the original (and I loved the original) but it ranks slightly below "South Seas" because of the harsher competitive feel. Also, the look of the "board" is more cluttered, making it more difficult to see what belongs to who at a glance.
 But I love the bonus tile mechanic.

The version I've played the most out of all the different types as it's available on-line on yucata.de (probably over 200 plays!!!).

This is one of my go-tos for introducing people to Euro games. The fact that it has points tracking while playing and at end of game makes it exciting to see the results in the end.

Carcassonne was the second board game we owned in regards to hobby board games. We have played countless games of the original Carcassonne and loved every minute of it. We had the chance to pick up this game and I really liked the art and the price was right so I pulled the trigger. I figured I would just sell the version I ended up liking less. I didn't realize the subtle differences would make this game that much more engaging. If you were only going to own one copy of Carccassone I would definitely suggest this version. The art is far superior, the change from roads to rivers was genius especially when you take into account the lakes and full waterway scoring options. Hunters easily trump Farmers and I love the inclusion of bad animals that you can use to deduct points from your competition. Lastly, the limited bonus tiles are great because there is a race element to getting as many as you can before they are all gone.

The upside:
- I think it add ways to use your tile in comparison to carcassonne.
- The various stances that you give to your meeple (Hunter, Gatherer, Fisherman)
- The pile whith gold nuggets contains some surprises that you want to maximize its effect (but just for you).
- Shines with 2-3 players.

The downside:
- You can be waiting for that tile and it never shows up.

A fine version of Carcassonne that works particularly well as a two player game.  The pre-historical theme is a good fit.  I find it to be an excellent alternative to the base game, particularly now that we've expanded that into something that's become much longer and more complex.

H&G has a lot of mechanics that don't appeal: jigsaw, abstract tile placement games just aren't for me. However I've really come to enjoy H&G.

When i started board gaming hobby this game opened my eyes to the fact that bad board games exist. Its hard to point positive aspects of it except that it is extremaly easy to learn. You grab a tile you place it somewhere you put a meeple or not, it doesn't metter since any other player has almost the same influence on your final score. Art is meh. You can play it without thinking at all while talking and after 0,5h ... voila you created a picture from tiles ... many players like it i guess. 

I strongly disagree with a statment that everyone like Carcassonne. Its light game for sure but for me its not funny and lack of any depth coused me to avoid this game ever since.

Cheira a Carcassonne, mas é um jogo com bastantes diferenças e até com algumas vantagens, como por exemplo, ter mais tiles de série e o jogador passar a ter duas variedades de “meeples” (tradicionais e cabanas). Valoriza os rios, desvaloriza um pouco as cidades, dá outra importância aos campos… Visualmente não creio que tenha sido muito bem conseguido, mas nos restantes pontos, está impecável!

ALTERNATIVE TO THE 'MUST HAVE' GATEWAY TILE LAYING GAME
Plays pretty much like the original, although I prefer the artwork a little more on this version.  I purchased it hoping it would be a bit more accessble for my 5 year old son.  I don't really see a difference in the play but he does participate with some guidance - I think the theme may be a little more aspproachable.

RATING: 7.5
I really enjoyed this our first time playing, and think that, for me at least, this is a better game than Carcassonne, as it is easier to see where the points are and what gain you are making.  

I like the theme- again, for me it actually works better, and while the farmers in Carcassonne are just abstract little dudes to me, I can imagine the hunters in the tall grass, stalking the deer and mammoth. 

The gold and bonus card mechanic seemed to add to the fun, and I think that this game will be played often!

I just don't understand why this game exists. Carcassonne is hardly great anyway, although extremely popular - this is a rethemed and uglier-looking version, with a few rule changes which make the game worse.

Not quite as good as the original, but better for two players.  It's flaw, I think, is the enormous benefit a couple of the tiles have.  You can be playing well, but lose it immediately if your opponent gets the right tile at the right time. That being so, it's difficult to feel good about a loss or a win or that strategizing is ever really worth it.

It's like Carcassonne, redesigned to incorporate some of the best of the expansions into a balanced, streamlined package. I like the field solution in this game and the ability to negatively influence other people's fields with Tigers. I also like the river network scoring with huts; it gives the river tiles a boost to their usefulness.

I enjoy this game. A necessary modification in my view is that each player draws the tile for their next turn at the end of their current turn. This way, they have the entire round around the table to think of where to place it. Played in this way, it's as fast as it's supposed to be and I like this game.

A 7 as long as you play with a hand of 3 tiles (reduces the randomness and makes it more strategic).

It is about as complex as playing Carc with a couple of expansions.

Egy klasszissal gyengébb az eredetinél. Ugyanaz az alapötlet redesign-nal kiadva. Mégis, az állatok vadászata (a mezők ilyetén módosítása) miatt tud újat mutatni. Viszont a kártyák kicsiny választéka miatt a játék egyfajta rombolásba tud fordulni (könnyen, és sokszor hatásosan alkalmazható az "akadályozós" taktika, amikor az ellenfelünk meeple-et próbáljuk a lapkák fogságába ejteni).

Very happy with this version of Carcassonne. It actually has an expansion but I don't want it.

I feel like Carcassonne in general is a little repetitive -- pick a tile and add it to your whichever forest (city), river (road), or plain (farm) you're currently working on -- but the fish in this one makes me prefer this to regular old Carc. I do miss cloisters though, and am not sure the gold is an improvement -- so many forest tiles have them, and the bonuses can be quite swingy (especially the one that scares all tigers away which can be worth dozens of points).

Ironically, this is a much smoother game than the original.  However, the result is that it is complete in and of itself and doesn't handle expansions in the way the original does.

RATING: 9
Played the original but never bought it. Picked up this one because I liked the gameplay of the first one so much.  While a bit different, it does have a very similar feel to the original game.  Forests roughly correspond to cities as do rivers to roads. Hunters and huts are entirely new. Gameplay is elegant and engaging. A beautiful prehistoric world spans out before you. Tigers offer opportunties for offensive behavior, as does closing off an opponent&#039;s field or river system. This is a MUST HAVE for your gaming group if you have no intention of purchasing Carcasonne, and a SHOULD HAVE if you have the first one.

This is another of our thrift shop finds. A damaged but unopened copy cost us about $5. We really enjoy playing this.

It's taken me a year to realize, but Carcassonne is undergoing a sort of refinement progression. Hunters and Gatherers is my first Carcassonne game, and I defintely appreciate the flavor of this "Tile-laying and Score" series.

From what I've read, this is a good Carcassonne game to start out with. Not laden with expansions, so it's simple and complete. Thought-out strategy games make me cry, so watching the map develop on Carcassonne is my "happiness replacement" for substituting odds and risk for pure strat. Serendipity in lieu of Kasparov

Carcassonne is a great game for all ages and players - it is the game I use to introduce people to the new board games. It does seem particularly effective with women as many games are dismissed by the fairer sex as silly or too complicated. Hunters and Gatherers is to Carcassonne what TTR: Europe is to TTR. Both are fine but I think this is better straight out of the box. It has only one half expansion which is unnecessary to own. So get H&G if you want Carcassonne but will not buy expansions but get vanilla arcassone if you have the money and the obsession to pursue all the expansions which do offer some great variation to the base game.

We tried a little paleo tile laying. It's a really great prehistoric Carcassonne variant with some unique meeple placement and scoring options. I'm especially fond of the huts, fishing mechanic and the mammoth and sabertooth artwork on the tiles. Even though I often lose by a few points I really enjoy this game and am looking forward to more plays. I might even make some of my own tiles, I think it could benefit from a few Woolly Rhinos, Mastodons & Cave Bears to augment scoring, some weapon improvements (spears and nets) to alter hunts from 2 to 3 points per animal and another way to mitigate Tigers placements that scavenge your meadow deer. I highly recommend Hunters and Gatherers if you get the chance to play.

Surprisingly different yet as good as "vanilla" Carc. And for some reason the art though confusing for the first game, does have a soothing effect. Dynamics is a bit different though - not so much for different type of scoring for "farmers" (they are still powerful, maybe even a bit less here), but because of special tiles. Some of them are quite powerful (some can really hinder a certain strategy) so it's important to "build" forests to get these tiles. 

The art (or maybe it's theme) might push it a bit above the  original.

Visually beautiful, the bonus tiles are fun, many ways to score (of course), and it's hard to know who's won until the very end. Nice length. Different enough from the original Carcassonne to own both. I would never turn down a game.

[11 plays] Better than original Carcassonne, but perhaps not as good as Discovery. And Carc:Castle is the best for 2 players. 

H&G plays well right out of the box without needing expansions. Mechanics are more intuitive than the "farmers" from the original. Good quality art and bits. This is a very nice game.

Pros:  Quick, medium-light, with short set-up time and a good balance of luck and strategy.  Unique theme, colourful visuals, and better overall variety than the original Carcassonne.  Works very well with two players.

Cons:  A tad superficial, strategy is only so deep.

Comments:  Far more appealling and gratifying than the original Carcassonne without any expansions.

In my opinion this is more of a family game.  The whole tile laying mechanic and gameplay is a little simplistic.

RATING: 4.5
At first blush, I liked this better than the original (plus its various neverending expansions). H&G plays a little more viciously with two. In the original, we threw the river tiles into the mix and used them to stymie one another (or 3rd, 4th, etc. opponents). But H&G has "screw your neighbor" tiles built in - such as the tigers (which eat deer, depriving your hunters (kind of like farmers in the original) of catching those deer; and the sacred shrine tile; and the way the whole river/lake tile subset is structured. H&G is less a leisurely stroll in a bucolic setting, and more a "nature red in tooth and claw" kind of game. So it works much better for us as a two player, and I suspect as a multiplayer as well.

The feel of the game is very "Carcassonne". In many ways, it is fundamentally the same game, and hence deserves its name. But there are enough differences in H&G to warrant a look if you like Carcassone.

Update: Upon further play, I now prefer the original. If I'm really in the mood for a more cut-throat games, I prefer something that isn't from the Carcassonne family. H&G can hurt to look at after a while, as the graphics are bright and busy. I guess I just prefer the "feel" and elegance of the original.

Great sequel to the original Carcassonne.  The hunters are much "cleaner" than the farmers and the new huts and fish add some pizzazz.  More colorful and slightly more appealing when completed.  Fun!  <BR><BR>Two homemade rules that we have implemented:  Bulls are worth 4 and a mushroom in a forest increases the value of each forest tile to 3 points.  We have bought a second copy of the game and combine the two games.  We take out 60 or so tiles and leave in about 14 special tiles.  This adds a little more randomness and tension to the game, i.e., will the stonehenge be available or are there two 4 fish tiles, etc.  <BR><BR>One of 
Grandma's favorite games!

If you love Carcassonne but have added too many expansions (which are not easy to remove, once you mix all the tiles) and miss the brevity of the original game, I highly recommend getting the alternative "Hunters and Gatherers" standalone instead of another copy of the base game. It plays just as fast and is still as pretty, but is still different enough in a good way to warrant owning it in addition to regular Carcassonne.

RATING: 4
Of the Carcassonne permutations, this is by far the superior version (although now mildly outclassed by The Castle), and even with the addition of the animals to allow for new objectives, the fish to increase the value of the rivers and the special tiles it still is annoyingly luck driven and entirely too tactical for my taste.

With expansion, I have come to enjoy regular Carcassonne more than Hunters & Gatherers.

I own and have played 3 flavors of Carcassonne:  The Discovery, The Castle, and Hunters & Gatherers.  That is also the order in which I first played them.  The Discovery is the perfect introduction to Carcassonne because it is the simplest to learn.  Now, after playing H&G, and I can say that it is the best version of Carcassonne that I have yet played.  Lots of details and depth, and more interesting ways to score points and potentially steal them from your opponents.

I like Hunters and Gatherers very much.  I think that H&G corrects some elements that I was unhappy with from the original Carcassonne (e.g. farmer scoring,) but makes for a very good game.  I also like the bonus tile aspect for finishing out a forest, as well as the simplified bonuses for hunted animals.  The huts also make a great appearance as a tool for scoring.

After a series of 2-player games I&#039;m convinced this is better than its predecessor: more scope for planning (e.g. hut placement), more opportunities for hosage (the tigers aren&#039;t all that significant, but the shrine is a killer!), and better balance in the different ways of scoring. Points tend to come in smaller increments and there&#039;s less likelihood of someone running away with the victory through the luck of the draw. Well worth the modest price, even if you already own the original.

Carc H&G is a tile-laying game with no board.  Players draw and play one tile on their turn.  The tiles edges have landscape on them, either forest, meadow, or stream.  Players must match the edges of the piece they place with the existing "board".  After playing a piece, the player can place one of their 5 meeples on one of the landscape types--as a fisherman in a stream, a gatherer in a forest, or a hunter in a meadow.  When streams are completed (by ending on both ends into woods or a lake) or when forest is completed (by being completely surrounded by meadow), they score immediately and players get the meeples back that were claiming them.  Hunters remain in the meadows until the end of the game, at which time they're scored.
There are also bonus tiles available for finishing most forests that offer rare scoring or tactical opportunities.
The biggest knock I have on the game is the randomness of the tile draw.  You can WANT to do things, but you can't realistically strategize, since you don't have a hand of tiles.  So the game can decay into hurting your opponents as much as possible if you have poor draws.  
On the plus side, there is little downtime, as you're usually interested in the placement of your opponents' tiles as well, and there's some satisfaction in building and completing meadows and forests.  The components are beautiful and replayability is high.  I've gotten good use out of my copy, and it's been well-received by new gamers almost every time.  It is best at 2, but can accomodate 5.  Play time ~1h with experienced players.

A very, very neat side track of my beloved Carcassonne. With the same tile laying mechanism yet a bit different scoring (I particularly like the animal scoring and the fish huts) it creates a similar game that feels fresh enough to be an actual alternative. There are definitely days when I prefer this one.
I still would say, in case the original had never pulled you in it is unlikely this one will. The scoring is a bit more straightforward though which might be more appealing for newbies.

I think my rating of this needs an explanation, to be in any way fair to the game and its creator.

First up, I don't love Carcassonne (the base game) to begin with. I think it's a so-so game, that I can play if others want me to, but that I won't ask for myself. I also haven't played it very much, and might come to like it a bit more in time, but I highly doubt it will ever become a favourite.

Then we have Hunters and Gatherers. It adds a tonne of scoring complexity, with every tile having different animals and other stuff added to one or more of their regions, all affecting the immediate or final scoring in different ways. To me, the whole thing got very confusing, and extremely boring. In my opinion, the only real plus for the original Carcassonne is that the game is very simple. H&G removes that single plus and instead makes the game very complex.

That said, if you love Carcassonne, and you want to have more scoring variables to work with and keep track of, you will probably love Carcassone Hunters and Gatherers.

This is how the original Carcassonne should have been. The rules for 'farmers' are considerably easier and more logical and with the bonus tiles, there's now a huge incentive to finish somebody else's forest/city.

Excellent game. Easy to teach and scales well for various numbers of players. Has enough depth to interest a gamer, yet seems to appeal to casual gamers as well.

Easy and fun game. I heard that this version is the one you'll want if you are not interested in hundreds of expansions and that's probably true. It really feels like a complete game.

The only downside is the art. The original simply looks better and easier to distinguish the different parts. Also the stone age theme is not that interesting.

Tile quality is excellent, the insert is also good, there's place for everything and you can separate the different parts. Only wish they'd included a bag with the game to draw the tiles.

i actually like hunters & gatherers better than plain carcassonne;  the only reason i rate carc higher is because with all the expansions you can design your ideal game.  but the rivers in H&G are much more fun than the roads in plain carc because of the fish-filled lakes and the possibility of creating an elaborate river system.  i also enjoy the meadows with animals more than farms, possibly because it's easier to add animals to your meadow than to add completed cities to your farms.  and H&G is also quite attractive if you go in for natural, green landscapes.  now if only it expanded like regular carcassonne...

RATING: 7
[Hans im Glück 'Carcassonne - Die Jäger und Sammler' 2002 edition] {Ancient; tile-laying; optimal 2-3p} H&G is a good family game and one of the best tile-laying games. It is easy to learn but need times to master, esp. players have to learn how to 'invest' their hunters and gatherers and plan how to control a land or river system. Scoring happens all the time, which allows player to visual scores more easily, although it slightly disrupts the game flow. In addition, it's fun to play H&G. Highly recommended as a gateway game in any collection.

H&G is better with 2-3p - there is more control and the game is faster. It's still good with 4-5p but there is a minor downtime problem, esp. when each player tries each possible junction for the tile. It has good player interaction with mild confrontation. In addition, it is dynamic because tiles can be merged together and there are bonus tiles so that the situation may change abruptly. H&G involves some luck in the tile draw but it can be balanced by skillful placement of the hunters. It is crucial to balance long-term investments and short-term scores - don't lay down too many hunters in early game. If your game group really needs a strategic play, you can print the distribution of the tiles so that players can calculate risks more accurately.

There are many editions of Carcassonne. If one can only afford one Carcassonne game, I would recommend Hunters and Gatherers. (or 'Carcassonne, the City' if your game group like a more strategic version).

I would not buy its expansion. It just adds some overpower tiles without increasing fun or strategic depth.

I give this game a 10 for being very good on nearly all levels. It is small enough to fit in your pocket, quick enough to not take up your whole night, easy enough to teach anyone, and strategic enough to not get old even for seasoned players. An excellent gateway game. If you get someone to play this, they will enjoy it enough to play whatever you put in front of them next. I think the Scout expansion was weak, but I'm eagerly awaiting any REAL expansions they may decide to put out. This is a great game for 2-5 players. and changes a lot between 2-3 players due to the rules for sharing points on shared resources.

Z-Man at it again:

Z-man rules text says score forest TILES, but examples and math show scoring forest SEGMENTS.
Rio Grande Games rules explicitly say score forest SEGMENTS.
Play as scoring 2 points per forest SEGMENT.

Bottom right of Page 5 in Z-Man rules, example incorrectly scores the river as 3 points - it should be 5 points.

I rate basic Carcassonne a 10 and this one a 4.  Why?  Because it takes away the beautiful simplicity of Carcassonne and adds in many rules.  I don't think they enhance the game at all but rather add unneeded options to a game that was pure genius.  H&G isn't terrible.  I'd play it if requested.  But I'd choose regular Carc every single time if given the chance.

interesting variant of Carcassonne
I like the prehistoric theme.

There's great tension because of hut placement (everybody has exactly 2) to battle for whole river systems and because hunters only score at end of game while fishers and gatherers only score when completed (not at end of game).
The bonus tiles are a nice idea although the gold nuggets as triggers seem a bit odd.
Also, the tigers are an interesting idea to keep the farmers (=hunters) in check.

RATING: 7.4
[gameid=4390] is a great game under the right circumstances. It is one of the first games we bought and I think that early exposure has ensured a lasting love.

Anyone familiar with the Carcassone family will know what to expect. You place tiles, you hope to score tiles, though you have to beware because your opponent(s) can sneak up on you. There are bonus tiles, which provide subtle benefits, or can swing the game completely.

It is a game that requires little thought, though some is recommended, and which plays in about 30-45 minutes. We play it when we want to play something quick, easy to set up and which does not involve cards.

18 plays at the time of writing over 2½ year may not seem like much, but it has earned its place in our collection. Slowly we are introducing the kids to the game as well, though for now we play in teams of 2.

It is difficult to recommend though, because there are so many Carcassonne variants today. In our home it works great as a 2 player and is favoured over the much praised [gameid=7717] but each to his own. I think part of our love for the game is nostalgia...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

I'm a fan of Carcassonnes in general, and this is pretty good.  It seems that the rivers are similar to the roads in the original game, but with the scoring potential cranked up a bit, which is probably a good change.  I still like the theme of the original Carcassonne better.

Our copy of vanilla Carc is loaded up with enough expansions at this point that it's often close to 90 minutes a game. I love me some Carcassonne, but that has relegated it to "sometimes play this" status rather than the quick biweekly fix it used to be. Enter Hunters and Gatherers, a smaller (for us) version of the game with a new theme and some slight rule changes. Yes, please. I think I'd prefer to play this over non-expanded original Carc now, this version feels like it has more strategic paths than the old one which is something that the "field" changes can take a lot of credit for. 

The one issue are the special tiles. An excellent idea which borrows the brilliant goods mechanism from Traders and Builders, great addition. The problem is that some of the tiles have questionable balance, you may wish to remove one or more of them as you see fit to reduce any huge luck swings.

+ A few interesting twists on Carcassonne. The fish make "roads" more interesting, the "farms" work in a little different way, and the bonus tiles keep building "towns" as important as usual.

- The art on the cards is way too dense. It's hard to tell where pastures start and stop in many cases.

- The bonus tiles are bonkers powerful compared to the regular tiles.

This was a fun twist on Carcassonne to play for a few games, but not different enough to keep both versions around. Traded it away.

My first Carcassonne variant and one of the first half dozen games I purchased.  I'm glad I chose this one as an entry and to introduce others, especially due to the relative simplicity of hunter scoring vs. farmers in the original Carc.  It has been getting regular play since we got it, and while the frequency has dropped as I've acquired more games, it still hits the table regularly, which is the greatest testament to its quality and replayability.

CSSS Game - I may be one of the onle ones on here, but I actually don't like H&G as much as the original Carcassonne. It's probably due in part to the fact that I've played original Carcassone (plus expansions) for years, and only got H&G a few months ago.  But still, I feel like the expansions of Carcassonne make the game so great, and taking away all of that flexibility/variability of mixing & matching expansions really makes H&G significantly worse.  I've also never really found farmer scoring that confusing, so the fact that they're much simpler in H&G isn't a draw for me.  Finally, I think the graphics of H&G are too distracting.  All that being said, it's an excellent game, just not nearly as good as the original (plus expansions).

I've since plyed it with my 7 year old and I prefer it to O Zoo Le Mio. Much as I love OZLM, my otherwise frugal son (who would need three separate visits to B&N to spend his $10 gift certificate) falls in love with every tile he sees, so his money management skills really kill him in this game. Eliminating that makes Carc the better of the two games for us (as far as I'm concerned). I think Max prefers OZLM because he loves any game involving money. (In fact, that's probably another reason I prefer Carc -- trying to get him away from the money-based games.)

This takes the 'big field' strategy of regular Carc & kicks it repeatedly until it gets the hint. 
Very easy to sneak into someone else's creation & fewer meeples so cheap & dirty points are the order of the day.

My first Carc game, and I've got to say, I wasn't impressed.  The scoring rules were hard to grasp,  and I just didn't feel like I had a lot of options.  I'm sure I'll have to give another go someday, though, as everyone at my FLGS loves this

Better than base carc out of the box.  I keep this for a gateway game.  The flaming tree tile and shrine are too strong.  I remove those.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A less swingy and somewhat tamer version of Carcassonne that ends up being not as interesting.  That being said, it doesn't suffer from all the expansion issues of its bigger brother, so it often ends up being a version I'm willing to play instead of trying to sort out what Carcassonne expansions to use.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fantastic game- better than the original in my opinion, as it retains the same simple gameplay, but makes the sorting out of the farmers (now hunters) simpler. The only downside is that it could be graphically clearer, as it does seem quite messy compared with the (admittedly ultra-clean) graphics of the original. Still fantastic. One of my favourites.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
My most favorite Carcassonne edition. It is a standalone game where the game is set prehistoric. Fewer meeples per player imply tighter resrouces and deeper strategies. Huts and Hunters imply long-term planning.
The rules are as simple as the basic Carcassonne, but the gameplay is far more deeper, more fierce contests and higher tension. A definitely better but less well-known Carcassonne game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Another quick game with some strategy. We pick up a new tile when we play the one so you have a turn to think about it. Much less luck than original Carcassonne.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Feels a lot tighter and each turn feels a little bit more important than Carcassonne.  Huts seem to be of dubious value and my play improved once I realized that they were of secondary importance.  I finally dropped my rating down because I feel that the stack of 12 "bonus" tiles can be unbalanced, often rewarding the luckier player rather than the skilled one.  I've used them often for come-backs and have lost to them as well and after 25+ plays they have been more of an annoyance than a joy.

I find the game slightly less appealing than regular Carc. The theme is great but something is missing and the bonus tiles, I feel, are unbalanced. The shrine is way too powerful, allowing you to capture fields with ease while the mushroom tile is just too weak. I do like having the forest fire tile. That is a well-balanced tile. Overall, I think Carc. The Castle has the best selection of bonus tiles and they are extremely well-balanced. 
  The other complaint i have is the high number of lake tiles. These lake tiles makes most rivers shorter and as a result, less tension in terms of river-building.

This is better than vanilla Carc, but not as good as Inns and Cathedrals.  An interesting variant of Carc, but I prefer cities and roads to creeks and forests.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A neat twist on the Carcassonne formula, and interestingly mean as well. Fewer followers means getting even one stuck on a never-to-be-completed area is punishing, and doubly so since incomplete forests/rivers (read, castles and roads in original Carc terms) DON'T score at end of game.

I also find the fishing huts a neat addition as well as bonus tiles for adding to tiles with gold on them. Definitely one I don't mind revisiting.

I like it even better than the unexpanded Carcassonne.  I was surprised at how different the rivers are and forests are than the roads and cities in Caracssone.  Of course the graslands are much simpler than the farmers.  I think the mechanics are fundamentally similar, and it is really a very different tile distribution that changes this game.  It feels like a much tighter game.

Highly recommended for light gamers, family and friends. More strategic and longer play time than the original. Definately a different game than carcassonne, even though it has many of the same game mechanics.I gererally play both games in the same night and they have a totally different feel.The tile distribution is much more complex. The game play seems to be much more aggressive(maybe less civilized like the cavemen themselves). Only complaint is the Sacred Shrine bonus tile seems too powerful to me. Unlike the original carcassonne that needed an expansion to spice things up a bit, this one needs an expansion to take a little of the spice out.

A lighter, quicker version of Carcassonne, Hunters and Gatherers is a fun and easy to play game that goes quite quickly.

Even if all you have is the base game, it has much simpler rules and goes much quicker.

if you liked carcassone, then you will probably like this game as well. there is a little less luck than in cc or cce and there are some different scoring mechanisms, which fit the theme nicely. the 12 special tiles are also a nice addition. if you are worried that getting this is redundant if you already have carcassone, i would say that whether it will seem like that or not depends on how much a fan you are of the original game. if you really liked the original, then go ahead and get this one as well. if you just don't see yourself playing this type of game that often, then don't waste your money because they aren't that different that you would get bored of one and not the other.

Using the animals instead of the cities DOES improve on the confusing farmer rule, and the use of the bonus tiles is clever.  The fish and the huts seem to create possible huge swings, since one player could monopolize the points during and after the game, but that disappears somewhat with multiplayer games.  Still, I could easily play this or standard Carcassonne.

Enjoying this so far. I always enjoyed Carcassonne, I consider it a fantastically well designed game but it didn't excite me enough to suggest it on games night. A problem I've had is that I find the expansions interesting but don't like the way the additions take can make it convoluted but also add length to the game. I think Hunters and Gatherers does well to take the interesting bits, add a little bit more while keeping playtime in a sweetspot. Interesting enough for gamers, straight-forward enough to explain to those new to hobby.

Carcassonne: Hunters and Gatherers is a game in the Carcassonne series set in the stone age. Players build a prehistoric landscape with tiles depicting forests, rivers, lakes and grasslands. They then send out members of their tribe to hunt, gather, fish and establish fishing camps. It includes many of the familiar mechanics from Carcassonne with a few new options.

RATING: 7
I am a fan of the original Carcassonne, but like many others, I find the scoring of farms to be a constant headache. It is a mechanism that seems unusually difficult for such a simple game. The Hunters and Gatherers edition of Carcassonne replaces this difficult rule with a far simpler, easier to use version. To score the farms (known in this incarnation as meadows, because you are a hunter, not a farmer!) players simply count up the number of deer and mammoths pictured on their claimed fields. This simple tweak to the basic formula makes Hunters and Gatherers a far more enjoyable Carcassonne experience than the original. There are a few other modifications to the system, but none of them are hard to teach, so Carcassonne beginners and veterans alike will have an easy time picking them up.

By far the best of the Carcassonne family.

Recommended Variant: We like to play with the semi-official change to the Auroch special tiles that allow them to attack a hunter and drive it out of the field. It keeps ownership of a large pasture uncertain and allows for some great gotcha moments in the game.

This is a competent variant of Carcassonne, and I enjoy playing it, but I prefer the original (even without expansions). I think the addition of animals makes the scoring of rivers and fields a bit more arbitrary than the base game. If you're burned out on original Carc, this might be worth a shot, but I prefer some of the expansions to the base game to this for variation.

Got from European Math Trade. So far I quite like it, just like carcassonne but with a little simpler scoring. A little less polished than Carcassonne (rivers don't always meet other rivers on the tiles) Picky I know :P

Plays quick.  Easy to learn and score.  Great game for playing with the kids.  They like stacking the little wooden people up into cheerleader type pyramids.    My oldest kid likes to add sound effects when placing a tile.  This one's fun factor is good but not great.

RATING: 7.5
Nice carc variant.  Quite a few extra rules,  but feels more elegant than regular carc by a little bit - mostly through the loss of farmers.  Played a bit more 2er,  and still enjoying it,  although all the special tiles are pushing it into "fiddly".   Luckily,  you just need one person who knows how they go to play, though I'm sure there's a whole level of strategy involved in knowing what special tiles are available.

When I first started collecting I debated between Entdecker and Carcasonne as a "tile laying" game to buy.  I ended up with Entdecker.  I got this game for X-Mas a couple years later.  I think I chose wisely getting Entdecker as this game falls flat for me.  Maybe the other versions are better.  Not for me.

My introduction to euro gaming.  In my mind still the best euro game.  I love the strategy of this version more so than any other carcassonne.  I like the randomness of the bonus tiles.  I think games work best if there is a little randomness, but not too much that can't be overcome, and I think this game has that nice balance.  This is the game I use to introduce people to euro games.  I like playing this with 4 players best.  I also like it when each player plays an aggressive game.

RATING: 6.5
Played several times face-to-face and on BSW (with 2 to 4 players). Although it is considered to be the best stand-alone Carcassonne game by some, I do not really agree. There are several rules which I like (the scoring for rivers, which are much more valuable than roads in the blue version; the bonus tiles for finishing forests; the absence of scoring for unfinished elements; and the reduced number of meeples), but I am not too fond of the scoring for animals, the huts and some of the special tiles. Overall, it is probably not the version of Carcassonne I would choose to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
An interesting variation, similar to normal Carc, but with its own flavour.  I seem to have a little better luck with this, as the animals add something different to the strategy.

Variant of Carcassonne set in the Stone Age era. Beautiful tiles as usual, with bonus tiles and new methods of scoring adding a new twist to Carcassonne's tested mechanics. It plays tighter and provides more choices than vanilla Carcassonne. Possibly the only version of Carcassonne you'd ever need if you don't intend to collect all of Carcassonne's numerous expansions.

[microbadge=19675] A surprise gift from [user=porkuslime] as part of the [geeklist=193365]Pay it Forward First Geeklist[/geeklist]. This is definitely a more strategic Carcassonne and we love it! Still not much of a brainburner but there are some more interesting choices to make a ways to mess with your opponent. Great game. 

H&G makes me hate tigers, love salmon, and be absolutely cutthroat in my tile placement. Whereas in normal Carcassonne, I enjoy the feeling that we're building the world together, in H&G I want to ruin whatever my opponent is working on. I'll gleefully close off a river that my opponent so confidently played a hut along and try to place tigers in his carefully maintained meadows. H&G doesn't outright replace Carcassonne for me - sometimes I want to be friendly! - but it's a game I'll more than happily reach for if I'm feeling like playing an aggressive tile-laying game (which are all too few).

RATING: 8
Even though this is an excellent game, I'm not sure it's worth bothering with if you already have Carcassonne and the first couple of expansions. I only played it a few times and and have now passed it on to another home.

It has some improvements on vanilla Carcassonne, but they're mostly done better in the Carcassonne expansions. If I'd played H&G first maybe I would have preferred it, but as it is I just don't find it different enough.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Different enough from regular Carc to warrant owning both if you like the original game.  If you don't like the original, though, you probably wouldn't enjoy this either.  This version seems to be more suited for casual or youthful players.

Not as good as the original by any means, though still a good game. I'd probably rate it an 8 if regular Carc didn't exist, but it loses a point for being redundant and not as good.

The rivers and fishing huts are okay, but the bonus tiles are kind of dumb and one of them (the stonehenge one) is thoroughly broken and should never have been included.

I have revised my "Blue box"/"Green box" Carcassonne scores down and up respectively as it's probably a bit unfair to contribute scores to the database based on nostalgic feelings of "This was my first german style game".

I jumped into the Carcassonne empire of games with "Hunters and Gatherers."   It's a fine game, but my eyes hurt by the end of it and I can't imagine collecting too many additional other titles in this series. The scoring in this game is straightforward... one complaint registered against the original.

Initially, I felt H&G was a better game than the original Carcassonne.  It's not.  This is still a good game, and a nice way to change it up once in a while rather than playing the original game.

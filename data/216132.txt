เกม Economic ระดับกลางหนัก เรารับบทเป็นชนเผ่าที่จะมาพัฒนาเศรษฐกิจของสก๊อตแลนด์ในช่วงศตวรรษที่ 19 จุดชูโรงในช่วงระดมทุนก็คือระบบเกมที่หลายอย่างที่มีความคล้าย Terra Mystica อยู่จางๆ (ถึงเล่นแล้วจะมีบรรยากาศบางอย่างที่คล้ายก็จริงเพราะหยิบไอเดียมาใช้หลายอย่างแต่ก็ไม่ได้เหมือนอะไรขนาดนั้น เกมมีความเป็นตัวของตัวเองชัดเจน และไม่สามารถโยงไปถึงคำถามประเภท 'ถ้าชอบ TM แล้วผมจะชอบเกมนี้ไหม?' เพราะมันไม่ได้คล้ายในแบบนั้น)

เกมจะให้ผู้เล่นผลัดกันทำแอ๊คชั่นไปเรื่อยๆจนกว่าจะผ่านหมด 'น้ำมัน'ที่ทำให้เกมไปข้างหน้าคือเงินที่จะถูกใช้ในเกือบทุกแอ๊คชั่นในเกม ระบบหลักของเกมคือการวางและขยายแหล่งผลิตกับโรงงานแปรรูปสินค้า ขั้นตอนการขยายไม่ซับซ้อนคือต้องวางติดของของเดิมหรือต้องขยายผ่านการเดินเรือ (ต้องอัพเกรดเพิ่มระยะทาง) ในแต่ล่ะพื้นที่จะวางได้แค่ชิ้นเดียวทำให้ต้องแย่งกันนิดนึงเพราะค่าที่ดินในการสร้างไม่เท่ากัน สิ่งที่วางได้มีทั้งคนงานตัดไม้และคนงานเหมืองเพื่อหาทำเงิน, แกะ/วัว/ไร่ข้าวบาเลย์ อันเป็นแหล่งผลิตสินค้าพื้นฐาน และโรงงาน ชีส/ขนมปัง/วิสกี้ ที่จะให้สิทธิ์ในการแปรรูปของพื้นฐานไปเป็นสินค้าระดับสูงตามชนิดของโรงงาน โดยเกมนี้เราจะได้ผลผลิตในตอนจบรอบ (จากทั้งหมดห้ารอบ)

หนึ่งในสิ่งที่ทำให้เกมนี้น่าสนใจคือระบบตลาดที่ถูกขับเคลื่อนด้วยผู้เล่นในเกม - สินค้าทุกชนิดจะมีราคากลางที่จะขยับขึ้นลงทุกครั้งที่มีการซื้อขายผ่านตลาด ลูกเล่นที่ถูกเพิ่มขึ้นมาในเกมคือคิวป์พ่อค้าที่ผู้เล่นมีจำนวนจำกัด (อัพเกรดเพิ่มจำนวนได้) การจะซื้อขายสินค้าแต่ล่ะชิ้นเราจะต้องเอาตัวพ่อค้าไปวาง ถ้าตัวไม่พอก็ไม่สามารถซื้อขายได้ และในหนึ่งรอบเราจะไม่สามารถซื้อและขายสินค้าชนิดเดียวกันได้เด็ดขาด (ไม่มีระบบการปั่นราคาตลาดแล้วช้อนเอง) อีกหนึ่งจุดสำคัญของเกมนี้คือทันทีที่เราไปสร้างของติดกับแหล่งผลิต/แปรรูปสินค้าของผู้เล่นคนอื่นเราจะได้สิทธิ์ในการ 'ซื้อ' สินค้าชนิดนั้นได้ในราคาที่มีส่วนลด ระบบตรงนี้ผมคิดว่าดีนะเพราะเป็นการช่วยให้แต่ล่ะพื้นที่ในเกมมีคุณค่าเปลี่ยนไปตามแต่ผู้เล่นจะสร้างของออกมา เพราะหลายครั้งเราก็อยากจะขยายไปติดผู้เล่นคนอื่นเพราะมีสินค้าที่เราอยากได้ หรือเราก็พยายามจะวางของที่ราคากำลังสูงหลบกั๊กผู้เล่นคนอื่นไม่ให้มาซื้อ และสิ่งที่สำคัญอีกอย่างคือหนึ่งในโบนัสตอนจบเกมที่จะมอบให้กับผู้เล่นที่ทำการขยายพื้นที่ได้มากกว่าคนอื่น ทำให้มีเลเยอร์การตัดสินใจในการขยายพื้นที่เพิ่มเข้าไปอีก

หนึ่งในแต้มหลักของเราก็จะมาจากการส่งออกสินค้าผ่านไทล์ส่งออก โดยไทล์นี้จะโผล่มาให้หยิบเรื่อยๆแบบสุ่ม แต่ว่าราคาจะเพิ่มขึ้นไปตามรอบของเกม (ยิ่งหยิบช้ายิ่งแพง) ตัวไทล์จะบอกว่าต้องการสินค้าอะไร ถ้าทำสำเร็จแล้วจะได้ของรางวัลเป็นอะไร ส่วนมากจะเป็นแต้มที่มีลูกเล่นเสริมในการคิดมูลค่าแต้มนิดหน่อย ส่วนแต้มหลักอีกหมวดจะมาจากการทำตามเงื่อนไขประจำรอบ โดยเงื่อนไขนี้จะถูกเปิดออกมาตั้งแต่ต้นเกม ทำให้เราสามารถวางแผนล่วงหน้าได้ว่าในรอบไหนเราอยากจะสะสมของแบบไหนเป็นพิเศษไหม เนื่องจากเป็นการสุ่มมาทำให้จังหวะการเล่นในแต่ล่ะรอบแตกต่างกันไป (เป็นอีกระบบที่ใช้แนวทางจาก Terra Mystica แต่ว่าไม่ได้รุนแรงขนาดที่ว่าต้องทำให้ได้)

เกมนี้กติกาคลีน สอนไม่ยาก, downtime น้อย, เผ่าแต่ล่ะอันมีความสามารถพิเศษที่ดูแล้วเก่งในทางตัวเองแบบไม่ได้โกงเว่อร์กับบังคับวิธีการเล่นของเราจนเกินไป ตัวเกมมีช่องให้ทดลองทำท่าเยอะดี ข้อสังเกตุคือ เกมนี้สัดส่วนแผนระยะยาวจะไม่ชัดมากมีแค่ไทล์แต้มระหว่างรอบ จะหนักไปทางวางแผนหน้างานกับระยะกลางเป็นหลัก ข้อด้อยสำหรับสายระยะยาวคือมองไม่ออกว่าอีกฝ่ายจะขยายที่ไปทางไหน หรือจะขยายด้วยสินค้าแบบใด (อย่างใน Terra Mystica เราจะพอเห็นลางๆว่าคนไหนอยากจะโดดไปตรงไหน) และด้วยความที่เกมนี้ไม่มีการหาซื้อความสามารถพิเศษเพิ่มเติมระหว่างเล่น สายคอมโบก็อาจจะพบกว่าตัวเกมอาจจะราบเรียบไปซักนิด (ไม่มีพัฒนา Tech Tree , ไม่มีเพิ่มความสามารถจากพูลกลางแบบ Favor tiles ของ Terra Mystica)

ที่ขัดใจเล็กๆคืออยากให้มีเผ่ามากกว่านี้อีก (ฮา) ส่วนที่ขัดใจเยอะหน่อยคือระบบแต้มจากไทล์ส่งออก คือเกมนี้ทุกครั้งที่เราทำไทล์นี้สำเร็จหนึ่งในของรางวัลจะเป็นสัญลักษณ์สินค้านำเข้าที่มีอยู่สามแบบ ตัวเกมจะมีมาร์คเกอร์ไว้บอกผลรวมว่าสินค้าพวกนี้มีผู้เล่นทำไว้จำนวนเยอะแค่ไหน ตอนจบเกมสินค้าที่ถูกนำเข้ามาเยอะสุดจะมีมูลค่าแต้มต่อสัญลักษณ์ 'น้อยกว่า' อันที่มีคนนำเข้ามาน้อย (ยิ่งหายากยิ่งคุณค่าเยอะเพราะมีน้อย) ที่ไม่ชอบคือมันมีผลต่อสัดส่วนแต้มจบเยอะพอควร คือทำไทล์ส่งออกมาพอๆกันแต่ดันแพ้เพราะสินค้าที่เราถือไว้เยอะดันมีตัวคูณต่ำกว่าก็น่าเจ็บใจนิดหน่อย กับรู้สึกเหมือนโดนบังคับทำท่าขยับเรือโดยอัตโนมัติเพราะไม่งั้งออกไปไหนไม่ได้ แต่พอดียังอาจจะเล่นไม่เยอะพอ ขอไปลองท่าอื่นก่อน

กล่องนี้ไม่ได้แบ๊คมาเองเล่นของเพื่อนเพราะส่วนตัวไม่ได้ชอบ Terra Mystica มากมาย (เกมลีลาเยอะไปหน่อย) แต่ว่าฝากเพื่อนซื้อเหรียญโลหะของเกมนี้มา ส่วนตัวชอบเหรียญนี้มาก หน้าเหรียญครบ และลายกลางๆปรับใช้ได้หลายเกม
-----------------------------------------
???? [กบชอบ] -- ค่อนข้างบอกไม่ถูกเหมือนกันว่าชอบตรงไหน แต่ผมชอบบรรยากาศการเล่นของมันนะ คือผมชอบความคลีนแบบอธิบายง่ายเล่นง่ายแต่เกมลึก มีระบบ demand/supply แบบที่ผู้เล่นสร้างเอง เป็นเกมกลางๆที่เล่นแล้วแน่นแต่จบแล้วไม่เหนื่อยอยากลองท่าใหม่อีกซักรอบ (ผมไม่รู้สึกว่าเป็นเกมหนัก อาจจะเพราะเป็นเกมแบบที่ไม่มีแต้มลบมาไล่เฆี่ยน กับแอบมองแต้มคนอื่นยากนิดนึง เลยรู้สึกว่าเป็นเกมสบายๆ) จุดที่ไม่ชอบน่าจะเป็นความที่บางทีก็รู้สึกว่าเกมมันให้อารมณ์เรียบๆไปนิดโดนบล๊อกตรงนี้ก็หนีไปสร้างตรงโน้นชิลๆไปหน่อย

RATING: 8
4 plays / 2,4 players

LIKE: Good elements of engine building and map maneuvering. The market was very interesting and felt strategic. With 4 players, the map felt tight. I liked the use of the import goods and how they scored at the very end.

DISLIKE: Very similar to Terra Mystica on the map, but the market manipulation sets it apart. The icons were informative, but tiny. Some of the pieces felt a bit tiny as well. 2 player map was a little open. Teaching the cluster end scoring was difficult to explain.

OVERALL: Pretty fun, lots to enjoy in this game. There is some game variability with the clan powers and different sides of the maps. The maps may need to be modified even further for a tighter 2 or 3 player experience. The game feels VERY familiar to Terra Mystica, is there a need for both? I initially think TM is a bit more unique and has more to explore, but this plays smoother, and easier to teach.

RATING: 7
Take the market from Navegador, the contracts from Marco Polo and a large part of the gameplay from Terra Mystica and you get Clans of Caledonia.  It all comes together quite well for a solid engine building Euro.  My only complaint is that most of the points are awarded during end game scoring.

Since it's very derivative, I'd rather play Terra Mystica/Gaia Project over this every time.

RATING: 6
In my book, Clans of Caledonia falls into the same category with Terra Mystica and Voyages of Marco Polo. This game offers a ruthless experience in min-maxing your resources and planning your whole round before the your first action. A thing that makes the exercise even more exhausting is that the price of the actions is not fixed but depends on the space on the board on which you are building. This scatters the information everywhere in random directions and forces you to spend quite a bit if energy on finding the cheapest spots. 

I appreciate the design and could play but personally I am not too fond of calculating the cost of all my actions down to the last penny. I could but it is very exhausting. This game is basically a variatiom of the classic knapsack problem.  You know where you need to go but you just have to find the cheapest route.

I have to note that the different clans seem to play really well giving you different strategies to try out in every game.

I love it!  My kind of game - economic/engine-building.  The market offers a nice push-pull on resource production.  I like the incentive to build next to other people.  I like the incentive to spread out.  I like the asymmetric start and the clans.  Really, I just like the game!

Que jogo BOM! Uma das melhores experiencias que tive com BG em 2017, com certeza. O jogo possui mecânicas de vários outros jogos (Navegador, Marco Polo, Terra Mystica) e funciona muito bem. O mercado dele é extremamente interessante e funcional. A única coisa que realmente me desagrada é a caixa (pequena) e o tabuleiro que poderia ser maior. De resto é um grande jogo.

Yes, this game may not be offering anything new or groundbreaking but all those known and tested mechanics come together so well. The game is quite streamlined and I had the success even to get new gamers buy into it so much that they came back wanting to milk more cows and distill more whisky. My biggest irritation with the game is the arithmetics that come with having just one currency. I really don't find it enjoyable to spend my time around a table solving simple math problems. After five plays, I can say that the starting strategy feels a bit samey for all clans as without all those miners or workers out on the board you won't get to much in later turns where in Terra Mystica I felt like I could combine all sorts of strategies. The components may be a bit too tiny but this makes the game very portable to bring to any gaming occasion without much hassle. The market mechanism is the foremost element that helps the game stand out and gain its own place in a collection. Manipulation of markets with global events could have made the game even more enjoyable as opposed having upgrade mechanics which just feels like a ripped on mechanic which only creates unnecessary clutter without much adding much enjoyment. Overall good solid game, enjoy playing it but might end up trading it to open up space for a better version of it that helped to inspire it.

RATING: 7
A good straightforward euro with asymmetric starting powers, resource acquisition and conversion, fulfilling contracts and end game bonuses.  On the plus side, the game features nice components, fairly interesting round to round goals and bonuses, and an enjoyable market mechanic.  The hex maps suggest some good replay ability, and the theme is nice enough.  

On the downside, there is nothing particularly spectacular or new here (sorry jaded euro gamers!).  The font size and color on the board, on the player aides, and on the player boards is curiously hard to read, though certainly still playable.  

Some of the buzz surrounding Clans centers around its use of certain mechanics from Terra Mystica, including: asymmetric starting powers and a player board where you pull things off the board and place them on a map, (lots of games other than Terra Mystica have had these of course), round to round goals, a round consisting of each player taking small actions which rewards timing, and an end game bonus for strategically spreading out across the map.  

As I see it, however, the most interesting mechanics from Terra Mystica are missing here including:  terraforming, power, and round to round asymmetrical powers drafting.

Bottom line:  Clans is a good euro, though perhaps not a particularly great euro.

I'm not totally sure where I lie on this one. Definitely interested in playing again, and I could see my rating bumping to an 8. There's a lot going on here, and a lot of engines and systems. I think the clan differentiation is fantastic. Only played Terra Mystica once, and people consider this to be TM lite, which I guess I see. Would much, much rather play this than revisit that, though.

Solid goods conversion mechanisms and interesting puzzle to solve (how most efficiently to convert A into B, B into C and C into Vp). The only negative I have is that it does feel very solitary with everyone doing their own thing. Not really interested what everyone else is doing, just waiting for your turn to come again.

Fans of Terra Mystica will love this game. Only played once so far, but the group and I loved nearly everything about it. The buy/sell mechanic is super elegant and simple, but adds a lot.

Smoothly flowing resource optimization euro that successfully borrows elements from other greats in the genre. Getting your income flow set up quickly is important, but needs to be balanced carefully with contract completion and setup for the last couple of end-of-round bonuses. One of my few complaints is that the components could be a tad bit bigger. Overall a highly satisfying game.

Played it for the first time recently, and enjoyed it.  I was initially concerned about how fiddly the game might be, but that didn't seem to be an issue.  The game *did* take us quite a lot longer than the estimated play time, but we were (mostly) new players, so I would hope play time would come down with experience.  Very good game; will play again.

Interesse lijst Essen 2017.
Mix van Terra Mystica (maar makkelijker) en Isle of Skye (maar moeilijker).
Thema is hetzelfde als Isle of Skye.
Aandacht: Investeer in het begin in zaken die geld opbrengen, want dat heb je echt nodig in dit spel: mannekes of je clan-eigenschap.  Export-tegels zijn in het begin misschien goedkoop, maar als je genoeg geld verdient, kan je ze op het einde even goed kopen...

1st play: Wow, not expecting it to be as good as it is. Only played 2p so far, but it's an excellent puzzle. Felt like it might have gone 1 turn too long, as the last turn was simply buying VP's at any rate < €10, but that's the only flaw I could find with it.

2nd play: Chose completely different factions, bonuses and ports, it was still amazing, yet completely fresh and different. Apparently, I love spreadsheet games. This is the best game I've played in years, possibly the best euro I've ever played.

RATING: 9
This is probably one of those rare economic games in my collection with a market mechanism. I love the similarities with Terra Mystica (my no.1 game) yet it feels different enough to stand on its own. I forsee this game might rise into my top 10 with a few more plays under my belt. This game is a lighter fare in comparison to Terra but still enough weight and meaty decisions to make, and I find it easier to introduce to medium-weight Euro players. I also love how compact the components are and how it can fit into a small box.

First Play: Big first step to absorb the rules and I didn't really grasp the issue of the contracts until the end. Very clever game with a lot going on. A keeper.
Second Play: Less impressed this time I'm afraid. The game is massively prone to AP. Players were getting up and walking around the room whilst other players crunched the options (over and over again). My other reservation is the swinginess of the contract resources. One contract that moved sugar cane +2 resulted in a 50 point swing between players with the winner having no control over this action.

It seems a shame that a game with so many clever aspects will be decided by the uncoordinated actions of the group as a whole and the points from contracts will 95% of the time determine the winner. At this stage I'm feeling that I should sell this on.

Very nice game.  Did remind me of Terra Mystica with the round bonus tiles and the end of game scoring.  Removing buildings to get benefits was also similar.

Preliminary rating

For now I like it due to the similarities to TM, which is one of my all-time favs. However i dislike the disproportional importance of export contracts, as they are the main source of VP generation and will most likely decide who wins the game. Despite this their impact on the boardstate is not visible or felt in any way, they basically act as a resource sink or black hole you pour your resources into for a VP payout at the end, which is a weird disconnect for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
This is a very good game. I was told that this was similar to Terra Mystica, but a bit more of a traditional Euro-style resource conversion game. To say it is "similar" to Terra Mystica is an understatement. The flow of the game from set up through turn order and map placement is all extremely similar to TM. And, each clan has it's own special ability just like the races in TM. There is also a track that determines your ability to move across water, just like the shipping track in TM; but in Clans, it seems like it would be difficult to not upgrade this track. The game lasts 5 rounds and between rounds, you collect income (produce) and score points for some random tile that was placed at game start... almost identical to TM. Finally, players gain benefit when building next to other players' buildings; the benefit goes the opposite way from TM which is more logical and also a bit less interesting. All of these similarities are not a major issue, but also don't get me excited to play the game again. If I prefer TM, why not just play it?

There is a very interesting economy in the game that I assume works differently depending on which clans are involved in the game and how the players decide to push the system. The market here works like the market in Navegador where players can buy and sell at the market (but can only buy OR sell each good on one turn) and, of course, buying makes the price go up while selling makes the price go down. You need merchants to buy or sell a good and everyone starts with 2. Overall, the economic part of the game was really neat.

A genuinely enjoyable resource conversion and recipe fulfillment euro that is a Terra Mystica-killer at 2-3 player.  It isn’t as aggressive — Clans is friendlier — but provides plenty of gentle blocking, variable player powers via the clans, and a number of potentially viable strategies.

Are the clans perfectly balanced?  Hard to say with only a handful of plays but nothing feels too extremely wobbly.  Overall, I’m really happy with Clans.  One of the better games this year.

A decent economic game. I like variable player markets but the market in my first game was to static for me. It felt more like an area spreading game (for this connected settlement bonus). If you have a lot of buildings you can produce everything on your own and don't need the market. I had the 'buy only advanced buildings and buy simple products' strategy. In the end I had 6 Export tiles but was second in points. First was the guy who spread like no morning. He had 24 points in advanced products in the end and only 3 Export tiles.
I wished there was more market interaction. But maybe in depends on strategy of other players.
I played the 'Demo' on Tabletopia before backing but in solo mode there is a bigger market fluctuation induced by dice.

For a game that plays as easy as it does, it takes quite a while getting into, strange enough. Maybe it's for the plethora of different resources? It never felt original in any way, but it seems a real solid design. Have to play it more to get a better view. It was fun though!

As close to perfect as I've played.  Way easier than it looks, but deep and thought provoking.  Every clan plays so different.  Great game Juma. WOW.  Only problems I have seen so far is board and box seems a little small, and set up and storage is long and tight.  Other than that GREAT!

Definitely can see the Terra Mystica genes in this, but overall found it dull, abstracted and very much JASE. 

Nothing wrong mechanics wise, but I just don’t enjoy this sort of economic euro, didn’t feel much theme and zero desire to play it again.

Excellent mix of area control, goods production, market activity and contract completion wrapped in a beefy economics meta game. I love it! With variable character powers, starting goods, round bonuses and a pile of contracts this game is deep and rich with complex decision spaces. My AP moments should diminish with each new play as my familiarity with the interplay of mechanics helps me intuit the wholistic end game. It may be better than I think. For now, it's just plain awesome.

RATING: 7
This is a decent game and good for a few plays. 
But it is NO "Terra Mystica killer" as some have purported it to be.

There is a very direct comparison to the feel of Terra Mystica. Building next to other players triggers a bonus buy action which is discounted. There is an identical shipping range mechanic. There is aggressive land grabbing to achieve your network. There is end game "cluster" scoring. (called Settlements in CoC). The round scoring is a lot more loosey goosey than TM, since you don't have to achieve those conditions in that specific round. However, I don't think this aspect is actually better than TM because the points for round scoring are so minuscule compared to the rest of the scoring from the game. There is just a margin for a few points here and there from round scoring. Having the most of the rarest imported good will usually win you most games, because the margins there are much more substantial.

The asymmetric clans feels more to akin to Marco Polo (or the ships from Oracles of Delphi) than to the different factions of Terra Mystica. The contract fulfillment is identical to Marco Polo.
The market mechanic is lifted directly from Navegador.
The 4 corner ports are from Seafarers of Catan.

So while there is nothing mechanically new, the game comes together quite well.

After 2 games, my one concern is that an early money engine trumps all other strategies no matter which clan you play.  It gives you the ability to build more, which will snowball into a victory.

Terra Mystica's asymmetry is far superior. The 14 different factions don't play you. You have to play the factions differently depending on the game set up. Here in CoC, like in Marco Polo, the faction plays you. Eg, if you're playing Cunningham, what else are you going to other than to build 4 cows ASAP? If you're MacKenzie, you're going to build distilleries ASAP. The strategies are dictated by the clan. TM is that rare asymmetric game, that doesn't do that to you. 

As is typical of asymmetric powers, the clans don't initially seem balanced. After only 2 games, some very early initial impressions:
Cunningham's milk money seems very strong.
Stewart is super strong. 
McEwan, Buchanan, Robertson, and MacDonald seem very lacklustre.
But it is way too early to conclude.

Overall, this is a very successful euro design. Highly recommended.

UPDATE after 5 games: yes, an early money engine will pretty well beat all other strategies. Get all your workers out (at least one kind anyways), upgrade the tech to give you an extra $2 per worker...and you're on your way to victory. Not seeing the depth of replayability as TM has.
Dropped from 8 to 7. The clans are wildly asymmetrically imbalanced.

Pleasantly surprised by this one. Has a theme that I'm not usually into, but I do find it enjoyable here. The first half of my first play seemed a bit overwhelming, due to there being so many options, but by the end of that same game, I felt like I had a pretty good grasp on what a better strategy for the next game would be (and indeed, my score improved by about 20 points!).

Admittedly, I haven't played the vast majority of popular historical-ish economic/agriculture/farming/civilization building euro-type games that are out there, but this game really does seem to take the best of a lot of those types of games and refines/simplifies and integrates them together rather well.

Fantastic game. Takes some basic ideas of Terra Mystica, but simplifies the game play and adds a dynamic goods market. Balancing short-term scoring objectives and long-game infrastructure make decisions painstaking, since you both want quick goods to spend, but also want to build up your engine for the endgame. The individual player powers really vary the game play, and the relative ease of movement makes area control fierce on the board (even in a 2-p. game). Definitely a keeper.

12/8/17: After one play,  although I like the game,  I'm not sure of the balance between the clans.  Will need to play this more,  but liking the possibilities for long term playability.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
First play, 4p. After one play, I can see why this may be a good gateway/lighter Terra Mystica though I have my concerns. Firstly, several mechanisms seem not necessarily tacked on, but less impactful as they can be. 

As pointed out by several, the market does not matter much or rather it seems hard to plan around it though it may change with more plays.

The ports do not seem as useful or rather, seem biased towards certain clans. Which leads me to why CoC may not be/is not a good intro to Terra Mystica, and now, Gaia Project.

The clans are not balanced. Even when TM was first released, it was not intrinsically balanced as with more plays, certain races showed that they fared better with some of the round/endgame scoring. And that's why Gaia is such an improvement over TM because it had many many "playtesters", i.e. so many games of TM played online. 

On first blush, some of the clans do not seem well suited to the round/endgame scoring. Therefore, once the five round scoring tiles are revealed, the x+1 clans revealed will be clearly unbalanced.

Of course, this will be revealed further with more plays. But I am hesitant to do so because CoC is not my cup of tea similar to how Viticulture is not, because of the "random" recipe fulfilment. Being unable to plan ahead to what contracts come out in future rounds means that you will not be able to plan ahead and it is luck of the draw whether your processed good is more "valuable" after round one than another players.

Will not say no to a game but will not request. Rating unlikely to go beyond 7.

Certainly very good and may even be excellent. While there's a lot going on, it meshes together well; offering lots of options and no sign of 'one true path' to a win - though you'll obviously struggle if you're not competitive in exports - and it looks like you can catch up from an unpromising start once you start to exploit your Clan's advantages. Add a lot of variability in board set-up, choice of Clan, round scoring, starting set-up and the special port tiles and there's oodles of replayability too.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ Great medium-heavy-weight tight economic strategy game, with a nice engine-building aspect to it and which is relatively thematic (for an Euro).
++ A "Greatest Hits"  combinaison of many other games: Main mechanism of unit deployment on the map and the map area control like in Terra Mystica, Variable Player Power and Contract fulfillment like The Voyages of Marco Polo, Fluctuating Market like in Navegador, the Modular Map and Port Bonuses of Catan, and the great artwork Klemens Franz like in Isle of Skye and so many other Euros. 
++ There is several paths to victory which players can follow in this "point-salad" game, which is always an interesting aspect in a game.
++ The rule set is relatively simple but the game still offer a pretty deep gameplay with a lot of strategy to plan ahead and tactical play as the game progress.
++ I love that all the information are well integrated to all the components (Player's Boards, Market Board, Export Board, etc.) so it's easy to get the game on the table and to play it even if it'S been a will since the last game (no need to refer back to the rule book).
++ The game flow is great and downtime is somewhat minimal (although players need to think a lot to find the best move to do) since players just do one of eight possible actions every turn they have.
++ I love the Market Board where goods have fluctuating prices throughout the game.
++ I love the players-controlled variable scoring of the 3 Import Goods (Cotton, Tobacco and Sugar Cane) where the rarest goods are worth 5VP each, the second rarest goods are 4VP each and the most common goods are worth only 3VP each. This lead to really interesting decisions when fulfilling Contracts especially in the last round.
++ I love the variable player powers of the different clans. This, with all the variability from the starting ressources, the modular board, the Scoring Tiles, the Port Bonuses in play and the order of the Export Contracts show up, give a really great replayability to this game.
++ The components are all of good quality: The punchboards have a good thickness and are easy to punch out, the custom wooden tokens are small but are easy to handle and the metal coins are great (available only in the Premium edition).

:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- This game has a lot going on and is AP-Prone: The tight money management, the ressources/contract management, the fluctuating-price market management, the interactive map play, etc. There is a lot to consider to play really well and this can freeze some players like my wife.
-- The end-of-game Settlement Scoring is hard to grasp (and hard to teach) for new players. I know this part (along with the Neighboring Bonus and the Port Bonuses in the corners of the map) is important to have some really interesting decision about the placement of units on the map during the game, but I wonder if this could have been simpler.
-- There are not enough ressources tokens and we are sometime missing a few (or really close to missing some) to be able to play without having to find some replacement (ans we are playing 2-player games mostly, but my wife like hoarding ressources). I would have wish that there would be maybe 50% more, even though this would have increase the game cost. I hope that some ressources tokens will be available in the future to double the amount and to never have to think about missing on tokens again.
-- The box is a bit too small for my taste, as it's hard to fit all the content in an orderly fashion in it using a Plano-like plastic organizer like I love to do for games with lots of ressource tokens.
-- The setup time is a bit longer than I like to setup all the variable stuff in this game but is still reasonable when compared to the length of the game.
-- Harder and longer to teach to new people.

This is basically Terra Mystica done right (in my opinion, anyway). The theming gets a little bit weird at times where you have obvious mechanical lifts from TM (like the shipping track and village scoring bonuses at the end) that don’t seem to serve the setting very well, but otherwise the cash-based economy and various markets are nicely done and reasonably evocative. The asymmetry is done via very strong special powers (a la Marco Polo) rather than major rules overhauls, which strikes me as much more sensible.

A classical modern strategy game without anything new. Its particularity IMHO is to be extremely smooth. And this despite the many rules détails, and the VP salad. Solid work. Need to play more.

RATING: 6
While there's not really anything new here, the game takes a bunch of existing game elements and assembles them in a pretty decent way. It has a nice market system that ebbs and flows based on what's being bought and sold, demand tiles that reward you for cashing in sets of things, positional play on the board, etc.

I couldn't help but feel that some parts of the game didn't really need to be there, or felt like minor things that didn't justify their existence:

- The ports, for example, are a fairly minor element that gives you a couple little boosts during the game.
- The end of round scoring tiles are kind of neat, but also seem not tantalizing enough to really focus on much.
- I really like the market system, but I was left wishing it was a bit more volatile.
- Given the amount of money in the game, getting $1 for moving a token past certain spaces on the track seemed so minor as to be pointless.

Overall, I get why some of these things are there, as the random array of ports and scoring tiles makes for a slightly different game each time. It's just if they're going to be there, adding more rules/complexity to the game, I'd like them to have more oomph. While the overall design of the game is still really solid, we couldn't help but feel some things were just there for the sake of having more things.

On the flip side, the Clan tiles are really great! They're not just minor abilities; they're abilities that really form a basis for and drive your game strategy.

Overall, a game that didn't really get my blood pumping like I had hoped, but is also a solid resource churning type game. I look forward to playing more, but it didn't leave me dying to want to play again right away.

Very solid game that definitely shows Terra Mystica influences. Players take turns expanding their settlements by building production buildings, buying/selling goods, and fulfilling contracts. I love the variability of the modular board, the random harbor and goal tiles, as well as each clan's special ability. The scoring of the cotton, tobacco, and sugar cane based on scarcity is also a really clever touch! The game looks great but I just wish the board, the tokens and the tiles had been just a tad bigger. Some of the information can be hard to see. Terra Mystica fans will find a love to love here, but the game will appeal to any heavy Euro lover.

(After 1 play) I already like it more than I'll ever like Terra Mystica. Yes, in a way its 
 like 'Terra lite' but it has a unique style and delivery. Lots of choices to be made and the game gets more and more crunchy through its progeression. My only complaint is the somewhat randomness of the import goods. You really can't implement this into a strategy and it will def. impact end game scoring in a significant way thus lending itself to less of a strategical approach and more tactical/opportunistic approach in rounds four and five. Will take several plays to verify this and see if this in of itself is a strategy.

This game is just amazing! I love Terra Mystica so much, but it is hard for me to bring it to the table. Clans of Caledonia scaled well with all the nimbers of players count from 2-4 which also gives a very similar feel to TM. However, give more sense due to the theme, which integrated so well with the mechanic. For me CoC gives everything that TM gives with a reasonable amount of things to do. I do love the market mechanic in CoC than the Power track(purple track) in TM. Which to me it make more sense and more straight forward.

All in all, CoC gives everything of what I want in TM, scaled well with all the players count, easier to grasp, more forgiving than TM, but still as thinky as TM with an infinite replay ability. This is to me a perfect game! I couldn’t ask more than this. Love love love love the game.

Engaging and interesting. Still trying to suss out what good basic strategy looks like - some areas are very incremental (a good choice will save you 1-5 money over a bad choice), but there are also some very big decisions it's possible to make well or badly. (Starting position, contract selection, whether to build something particularly expensive for you, perhaps more.) The market is wonderful - the heart of it is familiar (buy/sell at current prices then move a marker up/down as many spaces as units of good were bought) from other titles / prototypes, but the wrinkle of "# of trades is limited by # of merchants" is lovely and makes it feel much better than other similar systems I've played.

Information communication is generally well done, though I find it hard to parse the costs of board spaces easily - I wish that, eg, the size of the coin were proportional/inversely-proportional to the cost, so you could take in the general flow of the cost-terrain at a glance rather than needing to parse every number. (Or other methods, like having different colors of coins for cost 1-2, 3-4, and 5-6.)

Players take the role of a Scottish clan, each with their own special abilities, and try to score points by setting up their own economy, rearing sheep and cows for meat and wool or milk (of which cheese can be made if you build the right production building), tilling grain (which can be transformed into bread or whisky with the right building), cutting wood (for money) and mining the mountains (for money). An important element of the game is the fulfillment of export/import contracts. The goods you produce can be traded for hops, cotton, tobacco and sugar cane. These imported goods are worth points at the end of the game. The contract can also give the player money or allow him to build at a discount (not paying the price of the land, but only the price of the building).
Players will also develop their navigation abilities which allow them to cross rivers and lochs, and increase the money making abilities of their miners and loggers.
The game also includes a national market on which players can buy and sell the Scottish goods. In order to do so a player needs to send one or more traders to the market. Each player (apart from special clan abilities) starts with 2 traders, but extra traders can be bought. When a player buys a good its price goes up, when a player sells the price goes down. A player cannot sell and buy the same good in 1 round to make a quick profit.
The game is played over 5 rounds. At the end of each round a variable scoring condition has to be met in order to rake in some points, but the largest chunk of points is scored at the end of the game. Players receive points for Scottish goods, money, the largest amount of villages, the largest amount of international trade contracts, the different import goods...
The scoring at the end of the game is reminiscent of 7 Wonders, but the game has a lot more in common with Terra Mystica: the different abilities of the clans, the fact that you can profit from building next to another clan (player who builds can buy the neighbouring good(s) at a discount), the different scoring conditions round per round, the navigation track, the individual player board which is filled with everything you can build and reveals the income (goods or money) as buildings/workers/cattle are built on the central game board..., and most importantly...the fact that it is a very nice game, with a lot of choices to be made, and as a consequence a high degree of replayability.

Has very similar aspects to Terra Mystica but this game fits together in my mind much cleaner than Terra Mystica -
 milk is required as input to make cheese, grain can become whiskey or bread, workers generate money, etc. The variable market hasn't really produced any surprises so far but was overlooked as a place to grab resources to fulfill export contracts in our first game. The most confusing part was the scoring of the rare items (cotton, tobacco). Our games have only involved 2 players and even with a tighter board, we haven't really ran into situations where building next to your opponent and getting a bonus action was heavily used. I'm curious if this happens more with 4 due to a tighter board. In all, I've been very happy with this game and the challenge that it has provided. Really excited to get more plays of this game in. 

[9 Jan 2018] - 8 (3 plays)
Played with 4 and had a very different game than before. With a high enough shipping, it's not that hard to build a ton of settlements connected via the waterways that don't have to be in a straight line. In fact, this opens the board up more to the neighbor bonus if another opponent is doing the same thing. I ended up focusing on the settlements and ensuring that tobacco was the rarest good while the second place opponent went after contracts. We were within a single point of each other and really one key map tile would have changed the outcome of the game. The other two, new players were also separated within a point and really that was due to one of them making a strong comeback with the final round scoring once they figured out the game. In all it was a very enjoyable experience but it did take 2-3 hours for us to finish.

This is the perfect weight for an economics game. Easy to learn, considering all the thing going on on the boards and the different ways to win. Game length and downtime are reasonable. Excluding the inevitably dragged on last round, like in every point salad.

Initial thoughts are that the area control and contract fulfillment mechanics are satisfying, but not so much the cube pushing and market boards parts.

It's still good game ... just not standing out among my favorites in this crowded genre. Completing contracts seems to be the main way to go.

[September 2017 - 7.9]
I backed Clans of Caledonia on Kickstarter, but got to play a full game with a near-final prototype at GenCon 2017, so this is more of a preliminary review that might be useful before the game comes out in the next month or so.

Clans’ biggest pro is that it is a very clean and intuitive game in its organization and play -- everything fits with the theme and all the levers of the game push and pull nicely. Variable starting player powers and resources, a shifting market, different contracts and bonus tiles and even a little bit of area control look like they’ll make each game different.

The bonus tiles are neat in that you can go for each one in each round, or look ahead to the future bonus tiles and try to overload on those by preparing for them the entire game. There’s a similar balance in the contracts -- where it can be best to buy early because they are cheap (at first, you are actually paid to get a contract) vs. having to pay more money for them late in the game, but of course, later in the game you know what contracts better fit your engine. The filled contacts also affect the import value (some of the end-game VP) of items on those very contracts, so there’s some nice jockeying there.

It all makes for some good interactive economic aspects (throughout what is mostly a Euro game), including a fluctuating resource market. While the market didn’t figure as big as I would have liked in our first game, I’m already thinking there are ways to manipulate it more. It creates some good decisions -- is it better in the long run to produce the good, or should I just buy it now?

Gameplay moves along nicely (maybe a few moments of AP since everything tends to affect everything else), but our group had no problem and got in a four-player learning game in 2 hours. I think 1-1.5 hours will be the standard. Score-counting throughout and at the end of the game was a real treat in that instead of having to count everything off the board, you just look at your player sheet and most of the math is already done for you there.

So the big question is where does Clans lie in the huge gamut of Euro building/upgrading/VP games?  While many compare it to Terra Mystica (which I haven’t played), it reminds me most of Viticulture with the building and upgrading to fulfill contracts. Where I think Viticulture has better art/themeing for my tastes, Clans is cleaner in its gameplay design without some of the randomness found in Viticulture’s cards. Interaction in Clans seemed minimal in our game (the slight area-control aspect in your number of clans at the end of the game seemed sorta tacked on), but as you start to look at all the moving levers, especially the market and the import values, I think there will be some more interaction in future games.

I’d call it a solid medium-weight Euro, as it’s not overly thinky and the gameplay is so smooth and intuitive. Again, this ranking is only after one play, and will likely shift -- higher if the interaction bumps up and I start to discover new levers to pull, or lower if the game starts to feel samey and gets lost in the litany of Euros.

RATING: 5.5
A solid game of it's type but it's type is the "acquire these resources to exchange for these resources to sell or exchange into these VP's" - and that's a type of game that I increasingly find tedious and dull. 

There are VP all over the place, which usually means there is not much interaction, but CoC mitigates that somewhat by having a mildly interesting board element where you can get in each other's way a bit and also provide yet another way to get VP. However it's fairly standard Euro fare with no mechanical engagement with the theme and in all truth little aesthetic engagement with the theme, although there is whisky and the different factions are clans with Scottish names.

Set up is a bit fiddly and there are a few things that could possibly have been dispensed with - the neighbour benefit being one and which feel underdeveloped as do the upgrades. The final scoring is a little obtuse and a bit random in that a player completing a contract late on can have a drastic affect on the final points yielded by the trade goods and that could be unintentional, based purely on what contract they could fulfil, rather than any planned strategy.

In the one game I've played the two players who had played before positioned 3rd and 4th and the two of us who were noobs placed 1st and 2nd despite neither of us having a clear grasp of the final points scoring for completed contracts - not sure what that says about the game.

Fits into the set of games that I would play again but would prefer to play something else instead.

Terra Mystica v2!   After 1 play, I like the game, but can't rate it much higher because it feels unoriginal.

Rating likely to stay the same or drop.   No reason to purchase this one if you already have TM.

Fun game themed on Scottish families developing industries to sustain their future during the Industrial Age.  Very familiar mechanics, as the game unabashedly stands on the shoulders of some Euro giants (Terra Mystica is an obvious one), but it’s very clean, moves at a nice clip, and offers some nice strategic considerations.  Little concerned about replayability, but we’ll see.

Played with four players last night, I enjoyed the theme and the idea of the different clans, which all of these clans have different and interesting abilities, but after these parts of the game, I did not enjoy the game play. 

To expand my opinion of lower rating, I disliked the idea of almost zero interaction, which for me stems from the lack of meaningful player interaction, and in the end, you just go to a different place on the map and pay the price of the land and worker or factory. 

In the end, I would much rather play Ora et Labora, Terra Mystica, or almost any Uew Rosenberg game. 

With that said, I would like to play the game solo, which I might enjoy immensely, but as a multiplayer game, I will not play this game again in the future.

Played it during different stages of development with the Designer. It evolved from a pretty good game in the beginning to a very good game. The different Clans encourage distinct play styles and offer a lot of variation.
0 hidden information, tons of options and different strategies. Easily one of the best economic-focused games I had the pleasure of playing.
If you enjoy the playstyle of Brass, but want more freedom of choice on what you can do and when you can do it and enjoy economic-focused games in general, this game should pique your interest.

The game is good and I'm happy to play it again, but I don't need to own it. It is too derivative from Terra Mystica (and others) to feel fresh. However, it does offer the "vibe" of TM in a more streamlined package. If only the teaching time could have been shortened, CoC might have been easier to get to the table.

Good economic spatial game of fulfilling contracts.

I am not sure about the Terra Mystica references with respect to [thing=216132][/thing].  Yes it has home hexes from which you expand your territory, and yes there is a bonus for expanding next to another player, but really that is about it.

It is an economic engine game played with a spatial aspect. I like it.
You spread out over the hexes producing either farm basics, or building factories and turning those basics into bread, whiskey and cheese.  The game then mainly revolves around the fulfilment of contracts based on you providing the goods to meet a contract.  There are other ways to get points but the contracts are the main method.

My fears are that the asymmetric clan powers are so strong that they effectively dictate your strategy.  I wonder if playing without them would give the game more space to breathe in terms of adopting a strategy?   And the game end scoring can be swingy with three of the goods you make in the contracts having a price which varies according to their rarity on said contracts. 

Clans of Caledonia is an enjoybable game to play, not so mentally challenging as the Terra Mystica game it is compared to.  How much replay-ability there is in it time will tell, but for now I am enjoying it.

I'm not a big fan of supply-and-demand-market games.  But the contract system is worse.  Contracts have varying levels of difficulty, are expensive to gain, and there are very few of them in a round.  In other words, he who goes first and happens to be able to complete the revealed contracts that round will win.  There's no catch-up if you've already fallen behind.

2017-11-28 : First play. Clearly heavily inspired by Terra Mystica, but in a good way - I like games where you can plan ahead and have an overarching long-term strategy. With clear graphics and a layout that lets you focus on your plan. And to quote Hannibal Smith "I love it when a plan comes together". The only possible downside is that I'm not currently seeing an alternative strategy to first getting lots of money by placing all/most miners and woodcutters on the board, upgrading the revenue, then going for the tobacco/cotton/sugar cane contracts in about equal numbers as they form the biggest point scoring opportunity with an average payout of 10+ points.

As I approach 10 plays, I’m actually less convinced of this game than I was at first. I don’t think the clan powers are balanced (and I hate having to hold an auction before the game even begins), and I think the contract flop can tilt the table towards one player ([i]Yay, more contracts that play right into what I’m producing![/i]). 

I want to love the game, but I find it frustrating that so much depends on your clan’s ability to make money (sorry, but the Fisherman clan, for example, is nowhere near as helpful as clans that make you/save you money) and how fortuitous contracts come out for some players but not others. 

The designer has made it clear that the game he wanted to make is one where it's mostly about contract scoring with settlements as a way to tilt the victory one way or another. As much as I want settlements to be an alternate path to victory, they're simply not intended to be that. 

I get that, but if the contracts aren't going your way, the settlements aren't nearly lucrative enough especially relative to how much it costs to create them. In every game, the player who eschewed settlements and focused solely on contracts has won.

...Fantastic game, enjoyed by the whole table.  The Clans are varied and interesting to explore.  Everyone chose a different path to points, and those paths interacted in delightful ways.  I've seen markets like this in other games, but this one saw a lot more use and movement than those others.  

I wish the board was larger.  It seemed unnecessarily small.  Also, some clans are harder to understand how to use effectively.  The final settlement scoring was difficult to explain and confusing up to the end for the other players.

RATING: 9
It seems that the end of round scoring has very little impact on the end game score.  You really need to complete the export tiles for the big multipliers on tobacco, cotton and cane. The other big scorer is the settlements, which makes expanding over the rivers very lucrative, and then the number of completed contracts.  Nice that you don't lose points for incomplete.
The game requires you to make the most of your clans ability, that's new!  Pay attention to your start position as well.
This played very well with 4 and equally well with just 1.  Very good game

I can probably be convinced that Terra Mystica was an influence on the design of Clans of Caledonia. That's about where the comparison stops, however. CoC is a fairly straightforward resource conversion game: money to various resources to contracts to points. And since contracts are the only major source of points that is where most of the effort goes. The game works fine but in no way does it come even close to a genre-defining game like Terra Mystica. It doesn't seem like it tries to, either, and not having followed its inception I'm not sure where that notion actually came from but if you are looking for a game to break new ground this is not it.

Sich als Spieleautor bei anderen Spielen zu bedienen ist kein Verbrechen. Kopierschützer wie der um sein geistiges Eigentumsrecht beflissene Dr. Knizia sind eher die Ausnahme. Manchmal, wie z.B. im Fall des gelungenen Zitatspiels LA GRANJA, gehen Autoren auch ganz offensiv mit ihrer Zitatsammlung um. Auch CLANS OF CALEDONIA versteckt seine Diebstähle nicht und präsentiert sich als Best of Ideenmix: hier ein bisschen Marktmechanismus aus NAVEGADOR, da ein bisschen Rundenwertung Marke ISLE OF SKYE, ein bisschen Charakterkarten aus MARCO POLO und vor allem viel TERRA MYSTICA werden in CoC offen verwendet. Während GAIA PROJECT die Next Generation seiner selbst einläutet, schaltet CoC einen Gang runter und fährt TERRA MYSTICA in die Garage zurück. CoC spielt sich leichter, eingängiger, menschenfreundlicher, ist weniger aggressiv, hat weniger Tiefe und lässt mehr mainstreamigen Spielraum. Es hat aber -wie jede Kopie- den Nachteil, dass es über die Originale kaum hinauskommt und daher auch an mangelnder Originalität und Charisma leidet, obwohl das Highland-Thema beautiful ist, die Grafik von Clemens Franz perfekt sitzt und auch Material und Verpackung nichts vermissen lassen. Mit wohlwollendem Blick ist CoC die Huldigung eines Fanboys, der damit seine eigene Spiele-Ich-AG am Leben erhält. Der Hype, der im Vorfeld um die Spiel 17 jedoch gemacht wurde, sagt mehr über TERRA MYSTICA und seinen Einfluss, der ähnlich prägend war wie PUERTO RICO, CAYLUS oder AGRICOLA, als über CoC und wird, ähnlich überhitzt wie Brasilien bei der Fußball WM im eigenen Land verpuffen, wieder auf Normaltemperatur hinabsinken und sich auf ein gesundes Maß einpendeln. Das wird dem guten Spiel letztendlich auch gut tun.

Clans of Caledonia
It is clear that the game designer has been inspired by many other games. It is a great mix of mechanisms from some of my favourite games. And the sum actually might be even greater than its parts. It feels well tested and balanced, I actually don't have anything big to complain about. 

You can quickly build an engine that is easy to understand and produce resources that can be used to get money by selling on a variable market. When a good is sold the price goes down. It works well, it feels natural for how a market should work. The price fluctuations does not make a huge difference but it is a nice touch. 

By building next to another player you get to buy goods that other player produce cheaper.
The production is thematic with cow, sheep and fields that produce raw material. And that you can slaughter the animals to get meat, to fulfill contracts and split up your groups to get more groups for scoring. 

There are no long chains or other hard to grasp things, turns go quickly and the game can be played by 4 under 2 hours. It is easy enough that I would call it a lot easier than terra mystica but with almost the same appeal. It it hard to say after just one game, but it feels like it will have good replayability with clans that are very different and round scorings that will change. 

A terra mysica light, that is a bit more modern. With a nice theme that works well and plays more quickly and can attract more players. I think this will go really high on bgg top list. Could be game of the year for mid weight euros (7th continent will be game of the year in total).  

Play it!

Minor negative: 
Some randomness with mission card draw near the end. 
Big difference in points for the import goods depending on the one that is least imported. Feels random that a good can give 3,4 or 5 points per good and it could go either way even the last turn, so you can't really plan for it. And it has a way to big impact on final scoring. 
 
From Terra mystica: 
Build next to someone to get bonus
Bonus per round (used in many games though)
Score points for most separate connected groups. 
Hexagonal map with many different structures.
Shipping that allow to build on other side of water.

From Scythe
Player board with wooden buildings that when build give something that was hidden under the building. 
When you built all of a building you get a bonus. 

From Settlers
Start the game by building two things on the board. The first in turn order, the second in reverse turn order. 
You may only build next to what you have already build. 

Mission tiles are borrowed from all other games.

So, I DO think this is a very, very good game.  It's well-designed, the replay value is very high, and I enjoy it.  I just don't think it breaks any new ground.  However, if you haven't played a lot of Feld-like Euros, this is definitely worth a play (even if you are a veteran to this type of game, you'll probably enjoy it).  

Its greatest positive?  A solo game can be completed in 30 to 45 minutes once you know the rules well.

Satisfying after a couple plays, and there are many subtle elements to scoring well that seem to inherently tighten up. The clan you choose is a huge factor in how the game goes. In a 4p, drafting last is not as much fun.

I can see why people compare this to TM, although the resemblance is only moderate.

Well developed and smooth gameplay.  Being competitive in contracts is necessary but how much and what else you do is personal and fun to achieve.  Definite Terra Mystica influences but clearly that was early in the design process as this has morphed into a much different game.  Fun to handle and nice to look at.

Not very original in the mechanics (Terra Mystica+Navegador+Marco Polo) but the final product is pleasant to play. It shouldn't become a ludic milestone, but it deserves the high ratings.

This is a very cool economic Euro. Even though it smashes together the core concepts of Terra Mystica and Navegador, it has an identity all its own. There's a lot to take in, and it's a bit of a brain burner, but if it keeps moving, it's awesome.

A note on the components. Man, do I wish this had been a bigger production. I like small boxes as much (even more!) than the next guy, but here the small pieces are a hindrance rather than a help. It's kind of hard to read the board because of tiny font, and my big fingers have trouble setting up the individual pieces on the player board. I'll tolerate this because the game is good, but I wish everything had been about 20% bigger.

I liked CoC, but I didn’t fall in love with it like I thought I would. I like the economy aspect of the game with the variable market and how you process basic goods into advanced goods.

This game combines Terra Mystica, Voyages of Marco Polo, and Navegador all together in a medium weight eurogame that packs a lot of punch.

Clans of Caledonia is an efficiency euro based on fulfilling contracts with an added market that bring some twists. With every contract players fulfill, a "rare" good is traded. The biggest incentive is to sell the most of the least traded of the three "rare" goods. This makes for end game score very easy to manipulate. As such, players tend to hold back until the last round to try to match final contracts to predict the good track value. This is a fun feeling, but makes the first half of the game a bit of generating an engine, expanding across the board, and ultimately treading water until it is time to commit to a "rare" good. Some good and some bad here. The market for buying/selling goods is very nice. It doesn't fluctuate as much as expected, but will make one different good more valuable and worth investing in each game. There is a lot of good things here, but due to the pacing, none of which is terribly exciting. I would happily play again. It feels novel and is worth trying.

RATING: 9
The more I play this game the better it gets.

The strategy is pretty hard to grasp since it's highly contract-dependent, and in fact it can be a little difficult to plan. The thing is that the nature of contracts also helps limit runaway player effects. 

The clans are sufficiently different that each player has different benefits. There are clearly clans that are best if you're newer and ones that are better with more plays.

I would happily play this all the time. I think the arc is interesting as it goes from "economic engine setup" to "exploiting areas for economic gain"

We played a 2-player game, live streamed with Juma Al-JouJou on Twitch. It was my first time seeing the game or the rules. This is done to keep as many honest reactions as possible during the playthrough. 

With that being said I was fairly overwhelmed in the first round or two. Not by the rules or mechanics, but the options available to me. A small case of analysis paralysis some might say, however I felt much more comfortable by the later rounds. By the 5th(final round), I was ready for 6-10! The same options that overwhelmed me in the beginning now had me intrigued and curious for more. 

There is a large amount of variety in the clans and objective tokens that will allow for many replays. Figuring out the best way to utilize each clan's unique ability and how to maximize the round scoring based upon changing objectives makes me want to play again to test myself to see how far I can push my scoring. I felt like my opponent had more opportunity to utilize their clan abilities, however this maybe due to lack of practice. Given the chance I would like to play with them (Clan MacKenzie) again or perhaps against them to see differing strategies.

I would most definitely like to play this again (I was sad we had to send it to another reviewer!) and am very curious about changing the number of players and what that does to the game dynamics. Very solid game, I was very happy to have a chance to play it and can't wait for my next opportunity!

Like always, the hype overpowers the actual game. It's a good and working game, but far from being something special.

While I don't mind the price tag much, those wooden tiles are tiny and are not of the best quality. It works though.

The game itself is pretty much straight forward, put stuff down and produce goods to put them on contracts that may bring you more or less points. Talking about the contracts, while I like the idea getting points depending on the availability, it's just not in your control, adding a huge chaos factor to the game. Those contracts are also the only way to win the game, with everything else giving a few points only.

Overall just another overhyped game. Good but far from being great.

RATING: 8
A very solid economic game + cool mechanisms on the (variable) map, like using cattle from the map as payment and thus losing control on that map etc. 

It's good, my group mostly enjoys it. Rules are straightforward, the clans interesting to play even though their special abilities are not game making (or breaking).

My main issue now after about 10 plays: it is rather one-dimensional. You really cannot win if you do not put your main focus on the contracts. I consciously tried other paths to victory in my last game, and I think I did perform pretty well (leveraging my clan abilities and getting a money engine working in a decent amount of time), but with only 4 contracts fulfilled in the end and had no chance. So CoC is now reaching the point were I need an expansion that introduces another dimension and paths to victory.

It's a solid 7. It's got a lot of very neat mechanics, comparisons to Terra Mystica are obvious due to the benefits of building adjacency and due to the shipping... the market is nice, it's all very nice...

It doesn't really do anything new. I'm not that fussed that it doesn't broker new ground, but it surprises me in away because so often the hype surrounds games that do so. Everything it does will be familiar to boardgamers from one game or another.

The player abilities are all fairly even despite also being very powerful. The thing is though that despite the variety and despite it always being a different game, it somehow still feels obvious, quite blunt... quite 1 dimensional. Get miners as fast as possible and upgrade the mine for instance. Obvious.

I'm still a bit annoyed that I backed it on kickstarter and still haven't had my game arrive.

I'm also not impressed with the size of the box (too small for components) and the quality of the rules. The printed FAQ is longer than the rules book itself.

Got from Kickstarter. 

An interesting economics based game. It has several paths to success, and a fixed timeframe that precludes you from following all of them simultaneously. 

One of the interesting mechanics of the game is the trade mechanic that kicks in when you settle / expand near another player. Given the size of the board, a 2 player game makes it difficult to take the benefit of this mechanic.

Have played with 2, as well as with 4.  So, wanted to like it, but was left indifferent. Love the theme and is the type of game that typically is in my sweet spot. It's not a bad game. Unfortunately, it just doesn't bring enough new and/or doesn't improve upon things that already exist.  Can't think of why I would choose this over Terra Mystica other than to teach those who still haven't played.

Great elements combination from great games. Round scorings are not effective and doesnt effect the gameplay too much. Contracts seem much more important. Early money mechanics seem superior. Clans variety is a good element but clans are definitely inbalanced. Market elements are well done but didnt impress me enough. Still better than agricola. Replayability is high but the game is not a terra mystica killer. May be counted as streamlined terra mystica with resource management and market stocks to manipulate.

Solid and elegant game play mechanics. This might be my go to game if I'm itching for a lighter Terra Mystica. While TM focuses on the building aspect of the hex maps, Caledonia focuses on the economics aspect of the game. Prices for goods changes wildly depending on the demands and supply in the game. Clans also adds another layer of depth when it shapes gameplay to suit each clan ability. Brilliant!

A surface glance at Clans of Caledonia would initially give the impression of a Terra Mystica rip-off. This is far from the case as the game's actions are much smaller in reach than those in Terra Mystica, giving the game a faster pace and increasing the tension as short-term plans of two or three actions can be potentially derailed by what other players choose to do. The player powers and map layout can also change the way the game plays out significantly, adding solid replay value. It's a game I see hitting the table frequently with little complaint from me.

I've only played this once but it does remind me a lot of Terra Mystica BUT I don't consider it a TM killer.  TM is a bit more on the strategy side while CoC feels more tactical.  I definitely think this is a bit simpler to pick up and understand than TM and can probably play faster.  I don't want to say this is a more streamlined version of TM because there are some aspects of the game that are, let's say, finicky.

Overall, this is a solid Euro game with a good amount of variability in the gameplay (thus adding replayability).

Not 100% sure about this game yet. I played a solo to learn the game that was ok... but I did just play a two player game that was a lot more interesting. I'm not sold but I do agree this game has a lot to explore. The game is not intuitive though and will take effort to learn but once you learn the game it actually plays very quickly. Your turns can come around very quickly. The rules and orders they come out change the game play quite a bit. One down side is that each player has a different starting ability, and that's good except that you will have to continually refer back to the rule book for some of them until you learn it well; an individual player aid explaining your clan would have helped a lot!

2017-11-06 - This is a good engine building game. It feels like a lighter, almost introduction to the concepts that Terra Mystica implements. It's much more forgiving and less tight, and the contract element gives you some focus, which is nice. I enjoyed it.

RATING: 9
Just a couple of plays so far, and I think this is a definite contender for game of the year for me. It's so satisfying to place your pieces on the board and watch your production grow and grow. The market is a great asset to the game and should make for some good interaction, especially with more players.

The clan abilities feel fairly distinct but not overpowered. The value of the import goods is an interesting twist on end game scoring. I also like the way settlement scoring is handled. Excellent game! The solo game is pretty enjoyable as well. I probably won't play it too often, but it is definitely a well designed solo experience.

With 5+ plays, I am continuing to love this game and want to play it more and more. Hopefully that appreciation will last for 10+ or more plays.

Yes, Clans of Caledonia has made its way onto my list of perfect games. I bought this game, played it once, and then immediately played it ~5 more times, a couple of those solo.

This is great example of a well designed euro, I would describe it something along the lines of scythe meets settlers of Catan. It has the excellent euro design of actions being simple to understand, but a deep complex strategy that makes use of them. There are a lot of actions and paths to victory but each one is important and quick turns prevent grindy games. I will never play Catan again unless it is with children, as this game scratches the same itch without the luck factor.

Loving this game! I didn't care for Terra Mystica (I really tried to like it), and even though this game is similar in many ways, it's a much more interesting game in my opinion. Maybe it's the theme I prefer, don't know, but I'm already wanting to play it again. Really good. Rating may go up with additional plays.

I think my favorite components are the export tiles. Love the graphics and the feel of them so much - really nice!

2017-11-04 - 7 -Definitely better than Terra Mystica. Less tiring and annoying. It's not just different setting for TM, because many things are different, but clearly some elements were almost directly transfered from TM to Clans. It's an economic game where you produce goods, process them into different goods and sell them (but you don't need to produce, as you can always buy them). Spacial element and common market makes for some interaction. It's a nice one step above middleweight eurogame. I'm eager to play again and get to know new Clans special powers. I wonder how long legs this one has.

2018-02-17 - 7->8 - I played again and I have to say that it is a very enjoyable game, which runs pretty smoothly. Maybe it is not something very new and unique, but I don't really care when the game is that good. You can plan ahead here, but on the other hand it is good to use the opportunities made by other players.

At first glance there are a lot of similarities to Terra Mystica, but the gameplay feels very different, especially with the addition of the contract fulfillment aspect. Neat game and I’ll keep in my collection for now because it is quite good.

Bought on KS.  Played a couple of times, since receiving it.   I have never played terra mystica.   Game is spectacular.  My only complaint is I have to keep going back to the rule book for : what does this symbol mean (on ocean or shield tiles), or when do I score X move, or looking at when certain powers activate.    There are many contingencies on what can happen, and there is no quick sheet for them, you have to dig through the rule book.     The plus is the rule book is well written so the info is in there, it is just a bit to digest.  Spectacular game, glad I kickstarted it.

Not only a great game, but it doubles as a Scottish puzzle box.

Hmm... This doesn't bring anything new to the genre. What it do,  it does it ok: no usability issues, but quite amount of little rules to remember. And CoC is a point-salad-game with very minimum of hidden information - a bit more would make things more interesting. Different kind of clans with different kind of power-ups is nice idea, although it means that you have to play the way that you use those power-ups as much as you can. For me CoC is 6 or it might go down to 5: I just don't get enough unique and fresh ideas compared to what this takes (120 minutes) time to play.

While I enjoy the game play, I want to see the market a bit more volatile but perhaps it takes quite a bit of repeat play to see that occur? I continue to have concerns about balance among the different clan powers and don't want to deal with an auction at the start of a game to balance out the clans. 

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I can definitely see the comparisons to Terra Mystica but it is its own beast. Money doesn't feel as tight either in this one although it still is a limiting factor. You want to build next to opponent's buildings if possible to be able to purchase items more cheaply (assuming available merchants). The price/value changing as you buy/sell commodities also is a nice touch. It isn't what I would call a heavy game.

Tolles Spiel. Es hat sehr viele parallelen mit Terra Mystica, spielt sich aber doch anders.
Der Spielerreihenfolge nach hat jeder jeweils eine Aktion (bauen, Sehfahrt erweitern, Händler kaufen, Handel treiben, …, passen). Wer passt, scheidet aus der Runde aus und und guckt die restliche davon zu (was nicht lange dauert).
Es können verschiedenste Gebäude gebaut werden, die verschiedene Ressourcen generieren (Wolle, Milch, Getreide) oder Ressourcen in Andere verbessern (Milch in Käse, Getreide in Skotch oder Brot), zudem können Schafe und Rinder für Fleisch geschlachtet werden, werfen dann aber keine Ressourcen mehr ab... Somit baut man sich im Gegensatz zu TM hier eine schöne Engine. Wer in Nachbarschaft baut erhält dafür Marktaktionen, die allerdings auch bezahlt werden müssen. Man erhält nicht automatisch irgendetwas kostenloses.
Es gibt aber auch was zu bemängeln: Die Spielfiguren finde ich etwas fummelig.
Insgesammt ein sehr tolles Spiel das ich gerne wieder und wieder spiele.

After more than ten plays this is up there with our favourites. Highly strategic with a huge amount of replayability—the clans, contracts, modular terrains and starting goods combine to ensure there’s always a new set of problems to address and strengths to utilise. There’s a lot in the box and it’s all of high quality. Very well balanced. Atmospheric to play and lovely to look at. It’s certain to keep making it to our table.

I had the opportunity to test and play the prototype of Clans of Caledonia in an early and also some later stages.. and I am very much excited to get hands on it as soon as the final version will be released. Clans of Caledonia is a well balanced euro game with some interesting combination of different game mechanics. I really like the game because of its realistic 'story' (including the design) and its level of difficulty (not super complicated but still you have to plan ahead and there are completely different strategies to win and therefore also experienced euro gamers will like it). You can chose from several clans with completely different abilities which leads to a high replay value. Only the counting mechanism will hopefully be improved further before the final release :) But so far there are already a lot of thoughts put inside it, including a research about he real Clans and also many hours of improvement after the first prototype. Looking forward to the kickstarter campaign to get my own copy! A game definitely worth trying.

RATING: 6.9
1st Impression after one 4p game with stripped down beginner rules (no ports, objectives, and import market) and no clans.  The game's iconography is very clear, the player aids and map have all the information needed to refresh one's memory when playing.  The rules are in the medium weight, and fairly easy to comprehend and teach.   The Scottish theme is very nice, and makes you want to speak with a broguish accent. 
 The game is less interactive than I would like, more introspected than I would like, with more downtime than one would expect given the simplicity of the choices available during your turn.  I enjoyed playing it, and would play it again, although this kind of games are not among my favorites.   I probably would compare this to Terraforming Mars in terms of it being introspected, with players spending more time on their board and making their own internal plans than actually interacting over the table.

Enjoyed it a lot at first, but after seven games if feels like going through the motions. The clans dictate maybe too much your optimal strategy, and it's quite clear from the beginning what you have to do. The contracts can feel a bit swingy, especially in a two player game. It is nevertheless quite fun engine building game that makes sense even for newcomers and it doesn't take too long to finish. Setup is fiddly though.

A truly epic game, I have loved playing this both solo and with others. The complexity to begin with makes it hard to get going, however a very clear rulebook and excellent rule support via facebook makes any discrepencies easy to solve. Such a variety of clans and map modules makes this have extremely good longevity. That is, when I get bored of trying to beat my personal best in solo mode. Fully recommend with whiskey and a celtic soundtrack/scottish folk. Cannot wait to play this at my wedding in Scotland next October.

Point Salad, long playing time (1st play with 4 took 3,5 hours!). Inspired by Terra Mystica (meh). 

Off course this game is well designed, but it just takes to long for what it is. 
You see the better (more experienced) players run away, and there is little you can do. In that way I would categorize this game in a category i would like to call "lumbering heavy" games. It's like a big boat that starts floating in a direction, and its impossible to change course quickly.

Got to open this and play a game at BM York — a great game, but a bit of a faff to get started, especially with all the different asymmetrical Clans at start up.  There was a quite a bit of rule checking for the first half-hour, but once we got rolling, it was universally liked by all (and they wanted to play it again later!) — I will say that the player boards are smaller than I thought they'd be, so if you wear glasses, be sure to have them to hand: some of the icons are tiny!

A really cool game that I'm looking forward to playing again for a couple reasons.  1) Because it was really need and deep but also B) because there was some suspicion at the table that my power (that of being able to have a second contract) might be OP?  Interested to try playing with another clan.

Really enjoy the asymmetry of the clans and it is a challenge to try out how best to play your clan, especially in conjunction with your opponents' clans. The economic feel is excellent and trying to raise one more cash to put down another factory, worker or animal is all part of the fun! Highly recommended. Congratulations Juma.

As a Terra Mystica lover it might not come as a surprise, but I really really liked this game after first play!

A fantastic game which is clearly built upon the shoulders of other fantastic games. When you play the game, you will probably notice the influences, while at the same time the game feels vastly different from any of the games that influenced it.

I really enjoy the clan abilities. They appear simple, but give significant game advantage if you make proper use of them. The board management is excellent, I really enjoy how the map works with plot costs and type. I really enjoy the round scorings, and how they are not tied specifically to your actions in that round, but are goals you can work up to from the beginning regardless of the round they take place in. The harbours are also a nice touch and encourages players to spread out. I really enjoy the market board as well, how the prices change depending on whether players sell or buy the good in question. 

Really enjoy this, and can't wait to play it again.

I think this wanted to be Terra Mystica, but wanted to be more thematic and extreme.  The game works fine, but nothing that I've not seen much of before.  A million ways to score, and a few paths to follow, but much dictated by the tiles available on what you need to do to win.  The adjacent settlements scoring at the end felt very tacked on and unsatisfying.  Later on the turns got a bit long as everyone had lots of money so lots of actions, and it started to drag.

Clans of Caledonia is an economic version of Terra mystica. You place buildings and workers on a board and earn money and resources each round. You have an adjustable resource market too. Different things are rewarded each round and you get points for exporting goods and having different connected villages on the board. This was in my experience a little bit more streamlined than TM, because there are more resources and money is scarce.

This game really revived the good old TM mechanics for me. Early Rating 8.7

This game is fantastic. Worker placement, resource management, selling/buying, land management and so much more. But, with all that it is easy to learn the mechanics. The strategy and thinking about your tactics is the tough part. Artwork is very nice and the whole gameplay is just amazing. I would suggest that if you don't play thought-provoking games this won't be for you because it does make you think about moves now but also several steps ahead. In some ways, you can ignore your opponent but in others, you will want to watch them closely, especially if they are manipulating the market or closing off territories to you, to name a few.

It's as tense as Terra Mystica with a little bit less rules & stress. (No sisyphean power bowls.) The theme (and modularity) is more to my liking. The market is fascinating and so much better than TM cult tracks. Sorry about the constant comparing, just explaining why I enjoy this so much more.

As others have noted, a more accessible, pretty fun Terra Mystica light. Pretty dependent on contracts for scoring in my opinion. Need to play more to determine balance. If you already own TM, I'm not sure you'd need or want to buy this.

RATING: 6.6
Terra Mystica similarities are present, but this seems like a more straightforward design overall. It presents a great mix of mechanisms. My only real concerns are the relatively low amount of interaction and the extent to which your special Clan power might dictate your strategy. They are so powerful that you'd be stupid not to abuse them!

A little bit more challenging that Kingdom Builder, but not much. Pretty much a rush to get contracts and fulfil them. Everything else is secondary.

Non-deterministic turn lengths (you are limited only by what money you can generate and spend) means that some players can be left out of the turn for a while.

Got a surprise play of this in with the Kickstarter edition. Its comparison to Terra Mystica is somewhat apt, though Clans felt more free flowing and less strict than Terra Mystica. The bits are a bit small, but once you get going make sense overall. There is a lot of money going throughout, which I think contributes to the flexibility feeling.

Clans is essentially a Terra Mystica variant.  Instead of multiple economies, there's multiple industries and a trading mechanism.  A decent alternative to Terra Mystica, but I will always prefer the original.

RATING: 8.2
Pros: 
-A lot of meaningful decision space. It's an optimization puzzle every single action
-Turns went by pretty quickly once I knew what I was doing

Cons:
-LONG setup/tear down
-I can imagine being brutal to play this with AP prone people. There are so many decisions you can make at any given time, so many things to consider

Time will tell if this was worth the hefty price tag.

RATING: N/A
Oh my, this is a fun game. I couldn't stand Terra Mystica, so this is my happy substitute. I appreciate all of the variability in the setup, and each of the player actions makes intuitive sense. The way the resources interact is also logical and consistent, and the market kicks it up another notch.

The scoring tiles helps give direction to the players each round, and the export contracts are a fun challenge along the way. I like the way players have control over the value of the imported goods, such as tobacco, sugar and cotton.

And the placement of the player pieces is its own game, trying to maximize control and mooch off opponents' goods. Love how money is required to do anything and is the ultimate resource to make your engine work. Overall, just a great game. Need to explore this further, for sure.

[b]Clans of Caledonia[/b] was sold via auction 11/18/17.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]Since there is so much info out there on Clans of Caledonia I'm going to keep my thoughts brief and only discuss why it is no longer in my collection. This is not to say I think Clans is a bad game, instead it is not the type of Euro game I enjoy. I've only played once so my thoughts are solely based on comparing Clans to what I typically enjoy in a Euro game; I am in no way declaring that the game was poorly designed. It's quite obvious that there are a lot of folks who really like this game, but I think there are some gamers who will get sucked into the hype and end up in the same boat I was in; so for that reason I will share my opinion on Clans of Caledonia.

I was enjoying Clans of Caledonia, minus the market being pretty stagnant and mostly a non factor, as the game moved along relatively smoothly. Money was scarce and efficiency was key until the game ended and we tallied up our scores. All of a sudden the game went from being tight and focused to a point salad scoring system. Everything you end the game with gets you points and there seemed to be disparity between the points given the degree of difficulty associated with certain objectives. For example settlement scoring was not only counter intuitive it also didn't seem to award enough points considering how difficult it is to create the largest interconnected network of settlements. A few players easily scored more points for leftover goods compared to the settlement bonuses which was a huge turn off for me. I would have enjoyed a more focused end game scoring, especially by removing the extra goods scoring. I appreciate a game that rewards efficiency all the way through scoring. If you produced extra goods that you couldn't ship I don't think you should be rewarded for that. The volatility of tobacco, sugarcane and cotton scoring was also frustrating. The first bunch of contracts all had cotton on them so cotton was always way ahead of the other goods and was destined to be the least valuable good.

In the end I guess I was looking for a more punishing end game and instead what starts as a really brutal game ends with a smorgasbord of points. Ultimately the end game scoring was quite unsatisfying and left me cold. While I would play again, it is not a game that I'd seek out and definitely not one I need to own.[/i]

Good solid Euro. Claim land and put out money generators and/or resource generators - they're your first decisions, to focus or to spread. Claim contracts, convert resources into contract fulfilments, get more contracts, claim more land, and keep going for 5 rounds. There's an out in that you can resources you're not invested in at the market place, and sell excess if you can't land a contract using that resource. Standard stuff but its clean and it seems like there's a few approaches to explore. It's fairly rules heavy, but once you get going the turns go by pretty quickly and that's a plus. If you love Euros and it's in your collection, you'd be happy.

Clans of Caledonia combines a lot of good game mechanisms. For what I've seen Juma took the good elements out of Terra Mystica, Marco Polo and Agricola, combined it, added a market and perfected it. Another plus is that you have a good solo player variant, wich can be played on tabletopia already. And these coins aargh, so beautiful and usable in Isle of Skye. Artist is Klemens Franz, love it. Also when on kickstarter it was also pretty complete. You saw what you get, except some bonus tiles. In most kickstarters I’m in the more stretch goals please group, in this game i was already very satisfied for what i saw. One minor, one clan must still be playtested (bonus clan chosen by public), but this is also due to the fast delivery of this game. 5 months for a Kickstarter is insane fast. who can complain then. Ah i'm gonna stop, can't wait to get this game.

Clans is a medium weight euro game.  I tend to enjoy worker placement euro games, but this one was just ok.  I felt that theme was lacking. I just did not feel it for some reason. It is a lot like terra mystica in mechanics, which ironically feels very thematic.  In Clans I felt like I was just doing actions.  That said there is a lot of thought that goes into your decisions, but nothing that made me feel like I was in Scotland making whiskey. 
I like and dislike that the clans force you to play to your clans strength. This is great in that it increases replay ability, but bad in that you are forced to pretty much play a specific way based on the clan.  In the games I played there was very little competition for space or resources.  That could be that our clans were so vastly different that we were all just able to do our own thing without stepping on one another toes.  The solo variant is nice to have, but with out feeling the theme I am not sure how much I will make use of that option.

Boy, has this game gotten a ton of hype!  Does it measure up to the hype?  No, but there aren't many games that could measure up to that level of hype.  

There certainly are some good things about the game.  Building different types of settlements on the board that generate different types of resources works great.  It gives the players a satisfyingly good feeling of accomplishment to set up and run.  The buy/sell market, borrowed from Navegador, is a nice touch, though I wish it were more volatile than it actually is.

I do, however, have some issues with it.  For one, a major source of points are the export contracts.  To fulfill one, you usually turn in a combination of resources (cheese, mutton from a slaughtered animal, wool, whiskey, etc) and you will gain points from the exported goods on the right side of the tile based on the position of that good on the scoretrack at the end of the game.  The imported goods are tobacco, sugar, cotton, and hopps.  But these import goods are absolutely NOWHERE in the rest of the game.  Huh?!?!?!?! I would much rather these tiles have scoring based on things you are actually doing in the game.  As mentioned, the score track is ridiculously overcrowded.  The positions of those three mentioned import goods, player scoring markers, and player settlement count markers are all on the track and it is a crowded mess by the end of the game.  I also have an issue with how the number of settlements are scored.  It takes quite a bit of effort to spread out over the board and if you decide to follow that route, you are going to have to plan and invest wisely to pull it off.  The problem?  The point payout is too meager and static for the effort needed.  In a 3-4 player game, first gets 18, second 12, and third 6.  I think number of separate settlements scoring needs to be a bit more dynamic.  Perhaps everyone's number could be compared to the player with the lowest number and each separate settlement you have in excess of that number could be worth X points.

All this said, it is a game I would  play again, though not suggest,  and there are several resource gathering/conversion games I would rank below it. But it is not a game that deserves to be in the top 10, which I am sure is where it is headed.  And it is not a game I feel compelled to add to my collection.

Clans of Caledonia is a game in which players are trying to build up a resource engine, and then use those resources to claim contracts. Players all receive a clan tile that defines both their starting resources and a special ability that helps influence but doesn't nail down their strategy for the game. From there, players buy and place production buildings into a hex board--they get bonuses for controlling territory but also minor bonuses for building next to opponents. There is also a market at which goods can be bought and sold; the prices fluctuate as that happens. The obvious comparison for this game is Terra Mystica, but this game is shorter, not as deep, and not as dependent on the variable player powers. I feel like Terra Mystica is a far richer and more satisfying game, but that's a really high bar, and I enjoyed this one quite a bit too. There's plenty of room for a lighter Terra Mystica.

Just a really enjoyable and multi facetted game. It takes a few plays to get the broad picture and really see all the pieces and how they fit, because there are a lot of things happening, but they all interconnect extremely well. Play the market board to raise and lower prices, carefully select contracts to manipulate the three import goods' value, or strategically place settlements on the main board. All this and more make this game such a joy to play, and it's actually very simple to learn. As with most great games, this one is pretty straight-forward, but very deep.

I actually like the small components, makes a 4 player game manageable on a decent table.

While the creators of Terra Mystica freshly released an update to people's favorite TM, with Gaia's Project, I think the best version of that category of game is this new Clans of Caledonia. It adds a lot of good things to an already exciting game. It solves the non-scalable map of TM, adds trades and overall better interactions. As with TM, it has a lot of replayability, which makes it go to the top for me.

If you like Terra Mystica or Scythe you should give this a try. 
I don't like either and think this is marginally better, mainly due to the different Clans. Mind you, I played Campbell and won, this influences my experience. Another player made a poor choice in the first round, and afterwards he was just along for the ride. 
No meaningful interaction, most of the time you're just waiting for the other players to finish so that you can do your thing. 
If you feel that less is more, or that game should have a clear focus, stay away from this one. Mechanically, the game works well, it's just not very excting.

RATING: 8
This game is for me a bit like Yedo: you recognize a lot of different mechanics from different games, but it's being assembled in an excellent matter, so that you get a great game.
It reminds me the most of Terra Mystica (it actually also calls 'shipping' , the scoring element each round and the settlement bonus at the end of the game (which also has the exact same distribution)) and Marco Polo (the fulfillment of contracts and a bonus at the end of the game and the different characters/clans). Also added is a classic market mechanism. 

But as said, all those borrowed game mechanisms are glued together in a very tight game where everything costs a lot of money and you have to think hard which and in whom order you will perform your actions. The way the special goods cotton, sugar cane and tobacco fluctuate, makes it also hard to see whom is in the lead at a certain moment.

Rating made after only a few plays, but I really like the theme and the complexity of this game.  There's a lot of things going on but it never really feels overwhelming and we found that AP only perhaps kicks in at the very end.  In every game that I have played each person adopted a very different strategy and yet the scores turned out very close.  And the randomness of the set-up means that you are directed down different paths each time.  It's a beautifully crafted game and much nicer, in my opinion, than Terra Mystica, which it resembles.

In this game, players have to tightly budget their money to construct buildings from their player boards to the central board. Each building either produces a basic resource, or transforms a basic resource into an advanced resource. The resources are then used to either fulfill contract tiles, or can be sold on the marketplace, which shifts the values of the goods each time they are bought or sold. All of this is pretty typical euro faire, but the game shines in a number of exciting ways.

The first amazing thing is that there are three types of resources printed on the contract tiles which have no physical representation. Rather, when you complete those contracts the corresponding type bumps up on the points track. At the end of the game, each resource scores for the player owning it, and the value of the scoring depends on the resource's relationship with the other 2 on the scoring track. Whichever is furthest along scores the least, and whatever players collectively have the least of scores the most. This is a fascinating dance.

Another really fantastic thing is that at the end of the game the player with the highest number of unconnected settlements will score the most points. When you build, you have to either build adjacent to your stuff, which only serves to expand your settlement, rather than make a new one, unless you bump your 'shipping track' which allows you to build across rivers or along however many water spaces. This encourages players to build in a sort of a checkerboard fashion, which also encourages opponents to get up in your face. There's even a bonus you get for building next to an opponent which allows you to buy a good from the marketplace at a discount.

Add to this a special scoring criteria at the end of each round, and fairly well balanced variable player powers, cute components, clear and consistent iconography, and a few other nice gameplay features that add to replayability even more, and you've got a really incredible game.

Very well designed. My group loves it after a few playes and it has the feel of a classic for us. The clan powers are thematic and fun to abuse in a very cleanly implemented Eurogame way. Significantly more interactive with four players than with less.
Plays quite smoothly even after a single game.

Oct 2017: Played with Colin. It was both interesting and less than I expected - I want to play it again. The engine of getting production from board placements was good, pressing the market was good, but it was lighter than I expected since it was so close to Terra Mystica. Without TM expectince/ownership, I would want. Tina will decide when she playes it but she hasn't played TM.

Jan 2018: It may have hit its peak. With Geia's release, this might not get offered. I'll give it more plays but since I (smartly) held back, I don't have an investment to recover.

I am not sure, what my issue with this game is. It just does not feel interesting during the play, although I cannot find something wrong with it. It is just an OK game with elements of Terra Mystica and other "collect resources by building producing sites and fulfill missions".

RATING: 9
This is a very solid game.

A lot of the mechanics are similar to Terra Mystica, so explaining how to play the game was a breeze with my group.  That being said, this game is not Terra Mystica.  The game play is refreshingly new and interesting without feeling too similar to any of the other games in my collection.

I've only had one issue with game play so far.  In their first game, some players will trade all their money away on the first turn fulfilling contracts.  This then leads them to have almost no income and resources for the rest of the game while the rest of the table plays.  It's something that can be avoided after the first time it happens pretty easily, but still annoying non-the-less.

I would give this game a perfect 10, but there's just one little thing I don't like about it.  It has a point salad type ending where you need to record everyone's bonus points down at the end in writing.  I don't really care for this dynamic in games, but everything else about this game is so great, it doesn't really bother me as much as it normally does.

Really great, I liked it by FAR more than Terra Mystica. The thematic ties to the actual gameplay made a lot more sense to me than bowls of energy and upgrading cubes to another kind of cubes. The marketplace and clans didn't make you feel shoehorned into one type of play either. Very much liked it.

Played 12 solo games on Tabletopia so far. Excellent game which I expect to be even better multiplayer. Relatively simple rules, yet really deep gameplay which offers many different options. Only you will restrict what you will do by choosing which clan to play, which exports to fulfill, what VP tiles to focus on, where to build, etc. It's like Terra Mystica, but less scripted, and more thematic. I absolutely love Terra Mystica, but this feels just as fulfilling. Great design!

This game had a lot of buzz and hype around its release... and it didn't disappoint. I was very happy with this big game in a little bow (that should have been a touch bigger). I can see the comparison to Terra Mystica and also see a little Scythe qualities to it. I was worried that having only 5 rounds would make me feel like I didn't do a whole lot, but that was not the case at all. I was expanding, buy, selling, fullfilling contracts, upgrading, using neighbor bonuses... The first play through was pretty long, especially with the teaching (there's a lot to talk about, but once you get going, its all intuitive). There were only a few very minor issues I had with the game. The Cotton, Tobacco, Sugar Cane market can jump a lot and really has a large final score impact. There is some semblance of control over it, and you can always diversify to make sure you don't miss out for the one that ends up being most rare. I wish I had more goods pieces so you don't have to worry about using the multiplier tiles. A dual layer board would have been a huge bonus, but it really doesn't need it. Most things are easily identified of where it should go if bumped. Only the shipping level would have needed to be remembered (Its important enough that you should know what level you are at). So much to do and so many options could lead to analysis paralysis. I really wish there were more variety with the different clans, but that is an easy future expansion addition. My last bit of being picky is that one of the player colors is the same as the milk tokens which can get mixed up in cleanup and take down, but should be pretty obvious when setting back up.

Played the game twice today for the first time. Feels like a classic Euro. Very tight, many options for victory points. Great game. I love the many decisions you can make. And so many different meeples (uh, tokens). For someone who loves tactile games, this is spot on.

My one complaint...I lost twice. I need to out-clan my sister.

RATING: 7
Clans of Caledonia hits all the high notes for an accessible, mid-weight euro with just the right hint of an economic touch to attract a gamer such as myself. Sure, seizing contracts is certainly the key to securing victory, but is that not what the game is about? You are one of many clans, trying to export as many goods as you produce, and become one of the elite distributors of Scotland. An odd complaint indeed by the masses--to not want to feel "constrained" to long-term contract fulfillment plan. I ask, "As opposed to what?" 

Also, I'll not delve too deep into the Terra Mystica and progeny comparison here, only to say that Clans of Caledonia achieves (in spades, mind you) what Terra Mystica fails to do: create a smooth-flowing, cohesive game that is indeed greater than the sum of its parts. Much like TM, player interaction is indirect and largely peaceful. I prefer a bit more zing. However, unlike TM, the economy-driven adjacency bonus in Clans is actually sensible and immediately useful. Other than the overly peaceful player interaction, Clans of Caledonia does just about -everything- else right, in my book. Well done, Juma!

Kickstarter games have had some major misses for me in the past (Euphoria, AquaSphere, Near and Far, Yokohama, etc... all got a lot of hype and are highly rated on BGG, but were major disappointments for me). Occasionally, though, Kickstarter will deliver a solid hit (looking at you Santorini). So I've learned to take the hype on new Kickstarter games with a large grain of salt and approach these games with an open mind. I waffled heavily on whether to back Clans of Caledonia- another longer game that could easily end up being a dud just collecting dust on my shelf waiting to be traded away- but ended up backing it with some trepidation.

This game did not disappoint. I have now played it 5 times, have enjoyed each play considerably and am looking forward to playing again. 

Each player starts the game with a unique clan, 55 coins and a random selection of three goods (or two goods and extra money). The clans each have a fairly straight forward, but powerful ability that provides unique approaches to solving common issues you face in the game- getting money, expanding on the board, buying from the market, etc...

Each turn consists of a player doing one action so the game moves at a pretty good clip. Play proceeds according to the order in which the players passed the previous round and players continue taking turns until everyone has passed. Pass earlier and you get a bigger boost of money going into the next round. Each round ends with a small scoring objective that is randomly placed out at the start of the game.

As you expand on the map, building out your network, you uncover resources on your player board that represent what you will generate at the end of each round. These resources can be used to generate more money, complete contracts, interact with clan abilities (and sometimes with the end of round scoring) and they are also points at the end of the game. 

Since each hex can only hold one piece, players are constantly getting into each other's way, vying for key areas on the map as well as looking to increase the number of separate connected "settlements" for that end game bonus. If you build next to an opponent's production building already on the map, you get a one time "neighborhood" bonus which lets you buy those types of goods at a discount. This takes some planning as you need to have the money, merchants and opportunity to do fully take advantage of this. You are constantly looking at how each of your opponents' builds affect your position, and need good timing to take best advantage of the opportunities that present themselves.

The one issue I can see with the game is the fact that scoring is deceptive upon initial explanation of the game. The scoring is really about the export contracts, with supplemental scoring in other areas. However, it's not immediately obvious that is the case because you are presented with a lot of different scoring options up font.  It took losing big one game to realize that non-contract scoring options were more of a supplement to the scoring of the exports than a viable independent strategy.

This balance "issue" isn't a game breaker for me, as long as everyone understands the huge importance of the export contracts up front. There are still several approaches to accomplishing those, so not everyone is forced into the same mode of playing.

Fun resource management and economy puzzle, by spreading out and controlling the board. Clearly inspired by Terra Mystica but I think I like this better. It takes out some of the unique aspects of Terra Mystica (mana pools, terraforming) in place of more resource management and supply and demand prices, and the game seems to be more intuitive as a result, and just as fun.

This game is a huge improvement over Terra Mystica. Love the theme, fantastic component quality, great 2 player and solo varients, better replayability because of modular map, abundance and variation of export contracts, and the port tiles. Also, the market is much more interesting and strategic than the Cult Tracks in TM. Huge fan of Terra Mystica, but it's just been bested by Clans of Caledonia.

Engine building fun! This game has just about everything I like. Variable startup w/ asymmetric powers that help guide you towards certain goals/strategy.  This game feels almost like it is the baby of 2 of my favorite games in Powergrid and Scythe. The economy aspect plus the area-ish control and expansion planning work well to create a tight game. 

Pros:
- Smooth engine building with tight tactical gameplay.  Brain burner goodness
- Multiple strategic paths to victory and asymmetric powers for tons of replayability
- Great economics simulator. 

Cons:
-  Game box is way too small and hellish to put away the game every time
- Brain burner fun can lead to some AP and teaching the game can be overwhelming.

OMG!!! What a game!!!

Just played once —will edit once I play to it again— but it was enough to get a grasp of the greatness Juma Al-Joujou has enclosed in this heartfelt eurogame. I love so many different things about it that writing all of them here would make this brief statement a fully and very long review.

Enough to say that everything seems so well tought, from the mechanics to the way you have to try harder to stretch from one turn to the other in order to squeeze the most benefit. 

I adore what I've seen so far —and again, I've only played it once— and, if not for another title, this could surely be 2017's best game.

In the vein of Eclipse and Terra Mystica where you go around taking actions until you can no longer afford them. Place pieces on the board to build networks and also place next to opponents' to trade goods at a discount. Claim contracts and produce the goods listed on them. Seems inspired by Terra Mystica everywhere. Both scoring and buy/sell values of goods float, but they all seem more incidental than anything, and don't really add enough uniqueness to what otherwise feels a re-skin and re-imagining of Terra Mystica (e.g. instead of a cultist track, you find something else taking its place).

Yup, this is a lot like Terra Mystica: you take turns doing a single action or passing, until everyone passes (5 rounds). On your turn you build stuff, possibly triggering extra stuff when you build adjacent to somebody else’s stuff. Every player has some unique power. Every turn you get VP by meeting a different type of requirement. At the end, you score VP for having the most stuff down (sort of). There are many differences as well, of course (e.g., money drives the engine, there’s a market to buy/sell stuff, the adjacency bonus gives you access to that market, you draft player powers from a random subset at the start of each game, etc.). 

Enjoyable game, would definitely play again, but I think I might prefer Gaia Project?

Excellent game! Easy to teach but lots of way to win. So the weight of the game is not in the rules but more in the choice of tactics you'll use to try to win. Also lots of iconagraphy to learn (clan and round bonuses icons are hard to understand without consulting the refence book). The game scales well from 1 to 3 players. Haven't tried a 4 player game yet. Game length and down time are just right!

Clans of Caledonia mixes a lot of Terra Mystica and some Marco Polo and Navegador into lighter, medium weight game. While it's fun to play, it doesn't reach the epicness and depth of TM or Gaia or the density of Marco Polo.

A challenging game, and one where I thought five rounds would not be sufficient, but it took about as long as my son's attention span would last.  Really enjoyed the market mechanism, and there was a constant see-saw of money and trying to determine how the investment would yield the most points.  

As a two-player game, some of the end game bonuses were very lopsided.  For example, I had one more settlement, but got a significant number of points, and there was no second prize for him.  I would have rather seen a sliding scale of points for settlements that all players would be awarded. I feel like majority scoring is punishing when you're only one achievement away from a tie

An engaging, solid economic game with some very interesting choices. The variety of clans and their unique abilities ensures everyone's strategy is largely different. I pulled out a shocking win in my first game by virtue of Clan Buchanan's ability to get more contracts, making up for my game-long deficit in Glory Points with huge bonuses for goods shipped. Plenty of variability in setup means lots of replayability. This one deserves the hype it's getting. My only drawbacks: Some of the strategies and scoring are kind of difficult to grasp without more plays, so you won't really get to appreciate this game fully until you have it to the table several times.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's the love-child of Terra Mystica and Marco Polo, with Navegador's market.

While clearly inspired by Terra Mystica, the greatest point of similarity is the strong requirement to focus on end-of-round scoring bonuses randomly set out at the start of each game. They also share hex maps with bonuses for adjacency, but the central feature of the Clans of Caledonia experience is the goods. All buildings produce either money, a primary good (wool, milk, wheat) or convert a primary good to a secondary (cheese, whisky, bread); goods can be bought and sold at the market, or (by far the largest source of points) spent to fulfill export contracts in a manner very similar to Marco Polo.

Most of Terra Mystica's more confusing (e.g. power) or point-salady (cult tracks) elements are also excised. Both do feature asymmetrical player powers, but Clans of Caledonia's are closer to those in Marco Polo, generally providing only a single special power rather than also differing in home terrain, costs, cult tracks, stronghold powers etc.

The result is something that feels a lot more cohesive, if not necessarily "simple" (it does add its own new bonuses, market rules and so forth). It all works very well.

It's early days yet but there are a few reasons I'm not entirely convinced. The first is the range of costs. A key reason that Terra Mystica feels so tight is the extortionate cost and difficulty of expansion and the high cost of improving the shipping/terraforming tracks. In Clans of Caledonia the cost of moving up the shipping track is $4, from starting money of $55. Oh, money can get tight, but it's still clearly more about the opportunity cost of taking an action to upgrade. It's a game of allocating ample resources, not a hard-scrabble fight to do anything at all.
It's also clear that export contracts will always provide the majority of player points (the designer has stated that this is deliberate) so it's more or less a game of trying to fulfill as many as possible while scoring efficiently in other ways along the way. I'm not sure that's a bad thing (other than the luck factor of new contracts which happen to match a player's available resources) but the sense of both competition and struggle is not keenly felt.

[Karma Games 2017 edition] {Scotland; set-collection, variable-player-power, network-building, variable-actions, solo; optimal solo / 4p} Clans of Caledonia is a solid victory-point amass game.  It's thematic, fun, multifaceted and interactive.  The commodity buy/sell side particularly attracts me.   Players have to balance the making of contracts, establishing settlements, cash flow and advancement of technology.  Good one!

CoC is a game about how to maximize the efficiency of your clan to win.  Some players dislike this.  They think their tactics are heavily driven by a clan. You can alter much after a clan is selected. I would like to try the auction of clans variant.

It is not difficult to explain the rules because the options are intuitive.  In my opinion, only the technology advance icon is non-intuitive to remember.  As other medium-weight game, there is a learning curve for this game.

Replayabilty is good with 9 clans + 9 starting tiles.  I am a bit worried that the initial clan + starting tile drives a player's effective moves in the entire game.  I have to yet to play this more to clear my worry.

The components are handy.  I like customised wooden meeples.  Everything is practical with good information help.  Use of iconology is good.  But it would be good if it can show the rarity of food more clearly.

The fact that you can't get rid of a contract if you take one can mean a single bad choice can kill your game. Plus, some of the player blocking can really screw someone over. It isn't a bad game, but there isn't anything super special about it either. Feels a bit too tight and mathematical for my tastes in general but will play it from time to time due to how relatively short it is for what you do.

EDIT: Played again with 4. It was slightly better and felt a bit different, but the game wasn't hugely better. It started to feel a bit samey, although the powers do change strategy. Tried a Market heavy focus and it didn't work out. Feels a bit brutal where one or two mistakes can cost you the game and thus lead to a lot of AP. I also wish you could buy and sell on the market for the same product. It is hard to use the market to make much money due to that. Also, the scoring of different contract goods can be huge but often just determined by luck. Like if one scores 3 or 5 could just be due to what contracts came out and what people were focusing on. That kind of sours the game a bit for me since you could have a perfect strategy but simply get poor contracts that don't synergize and have other players who make your scoring goods worth less with no way to combat it.

I played it more than twenty times with the designer and can assure you of having much fun. What I like is the combination of economy and area control. But mostly liked aspect is the permanent need of prioritizing. I prefer it to e.g. Terra Mystica because of theme and also game-play, so I am looking forward to another match.

Premium Clans of Caledonia
+ 220 wooden meeples
+ 70 custom metal coins 
+ KS Exclusive box sleeve featuring the clans 
+ including all stretch goals 

Rated 8 initially.  Additional plays and further review brought it down to 7.  

 100% derivative.  It's Terra Mystica Lite, although the market is a nice addition and is probably what raises it from a 6-7.  Winning is certainly about making the most of the contracts.  Unfortunately, there's a bit of a luck element as the values of the end-game commodities vary based on rarity, but their values can often be uncertain until very late in the game, at which point you can luck into a contract that can significantly change the game outcome (turn order and just having the right goods at the right time can make the difference).

Nonetheless, the game is solid and enjoyable.  I look forward to playing it more, but I would never choose to play this game over Terra Mystica or Gaia Project.  Basically, I would play this game if I really wanted to play TM or Gaia Project, but the group preferred a lighter, more simple game of similar variety.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
tl;dr: a more accessible [thing=120677][/thing]

When I say this is a more accessible Terra Mystica I don't mean it's a dumbed down or light game. It does however have a lot of similarities while  doeing do away with the terraforming and the building tree (you can just build any building right away). But also, just like Terra Mystica every player has some special character abilities, the board is made hexes with some water here and there that requires shipping abilities to cross and players must extend their current network to build new things. Also, there are bonuses for building next to other players. You know, kinda like Terra Mystica.
So yes, lots of things that feel like other games (mostly TM) but it is a very well put together design. Everything makes sense and blends well. Also, while maybe not as deep as TM, it is still a good strategic game with lots of depth in a manageable play time. Good stuff!

What a great game! It's simple, it's elegant, it has a tons of replayability! I'm just blown away by the design. The quality of the components and the art are very good. You just want to get better and better at this game.  That moment when you realize that your last move that - you thought - was very efficient , could be even better if you first did something else - priceless! And a minimal amount of negative interaction makes Clans of Caledonia even better. A solid candidate for my top 10!

Clans of Caledonia is obviously inspired by Terra Mystica, and I find it more enjoyable. I think that's in large part because, while there's still a bit of a race in claiming prime spots on the board and many constraints (especially your money) in how and when you build, Clans offers ways around just about anything and there is seldom that one, indispensable spot that you must claim or or get crushed as there is with Terra Mystica. For new players: beware! How you spend your limited funds on the first round can make or break you!

First play impression: loved the game. The overall gameplay is like a streamlined Terra Mystica, but there are also elements of Marco Polo (the contracts and clan abilities) and Navegador (the market). In that sense this is like a euro supergame. Can't wait to get more plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I had high expectations for this game and it did not disappoint. It has to be one of my favorite games even after 1 play so far. It incorporates many attributes from other games such as the board from Terra Mystica and contract fulfillment from Marco Polo. 

I enjoy the streamlined process of the turn action. Once you get a hang of it, there is little to no AP at all. The fun of it for me is reliant on how to efficiently manage and strategize my Clan ability. There is always a juicy decision to make and having a live market further tightens the game.

The only negative I have about the game is the box is a bit tight if you want alternative storage solution. Also, I always like the feel of resource tokens but its limited in this one.

Overall, the game has high replayability with modular board, asymmetry clans and 50 contracts to fulfill. The theme is amazing and I would highly recommend!

After playing it, this game is much simpler in its mechanics than what I thought it would be. Also much quicker (the 30 min per player that is written in the rulebook is quite true). I, however, liked it, almost as much as I expected, but would it have been more complex I would have liked it even more.
You basically place workers, get ressources to fulfil contracts, play with the prices at the market and create settlements. I found a bit frustrating that you product after doing all your actions, so to fullfil a contract you need to wait two turns most of the time unless you buy from the market, which is quite a waste if you produce the good yourself.

Very tightly designed and immersive. Good components and clear rules - the only thing I found confusing was the scoring for linked settlements. Looks to have very high replay value and would be happy to play at all player counts, including solo. I played as Clan Stewart and I think that I didn't optimise their trading ability, concentrating too much on contracts in the early game. I also should have separated my initial worker placement more, and my strategy to concentrate early on woodworkers fell behind to the miners quite quickly. A real brain-burner at times, in a very good way. It speaks volumes that I was still considering moves and strategies well after the game had ended!

I borrowed a copy of Clans of Caledonia from a friend on a whim. The simple market manipulation drew me in mechanically. The theme was a win mostly because I was reading an Outlander novel at the time. 
I was quickly surprised to find this was not just another half hearted KickStarter by a new designer. The rule set was in the sweet spot for difficulty and the components are top notch. While I tire of seeing Klemens Franz art work so often, the iconography was great and I found the presentation easy to understand. 
My only con? The end game scoring is a little odd.

Is this Terra Mystica killer? No way. I have 35 plays of TM what is a very rare exception for me being obsessed on new games. In general TM was a number one euro for a few years. Clans of Caledonia is one of the best euro this year, but no chance to achieve a glory of TM. I think 5 plays for CoC will be a good result. It is nice and smooth, but not exceptional and much more samey to other euros. CoC is more dynamic, location on map is of lower importance, players spread over the map quite fast and quite chaotic. TM is much more prescripted, the first placement is extremely important, players can create their strategy and long term plans on the map. All this makes TM more interesting and exceptional game. The only real concurrent to TM might be its  direct successor Gaia Project.

RATING: 8
First couple of run-throughs: Wow. What a deep, while also not very long, game. Plays amazing with two, not sure how many plays we'll get with more in the foreseeable future. As a two-player Euro, it's very meaty and fun. Wife isn't of the same opinion because she's lost twice, but she'll come around once she fixes her money shortages and wins a couple of sessions.

After several more plays, our main issue is that the clans' powers are DEFINITELY not balanced, at least for 2p. From now on, we will both play with the same clan and starting wealth, so that we don't start out with a winner all but predetermined.

This game is over complicated and unbalanced.  The different player powers ruin the game.  The customer service provided by the publisher is terrible.  My kickstarted version of the game was missing 16 pieces and the publisher did not reply to my email for 2 weeks.  When he finally did reply, he said "it may take a while" to ship me the pieces.  I have doubts that I will ever receive a complete copy of this game.  What a mistake it was kickstarting this game.

Excellent game that is a real brain-burner while still maintaining a very easy ruleset. This has potential to become my favorite heavy euro. The largest influence is probably Terra Mystica but there is a lot of other stuff mixed in. The end result is that it feels a bit more open than TM and lighter rulewise. My only reservation is that I am unable to say yet whether this might become repetitive after 10 plays, only more plays can tell. After 5 plays I can say it has not become repetitive but I do miss more clans.

RATING: 8.3
至今玩過了3遍，每次都有著不同的體驗，8.3是值得的，且應該獲得更高 :D
推薦這遊戲的原因不為別的，就是簡單跟流暢。 (好啦，美術跟配件是小加分
不愧是TM殺手! (但這個稱號我認為是說給新手玩家跟家庭性玩家聽的 XD
我並不否認TM更加的豐富，但我認為這款遊戲更平易近人。

以下是小小的心得:
1. 家族能力的確幫助玩家前期劃出一條道路，但那並不完全是必須的。
2. 得分重點分為任務和擴展，在這之間的平衡關係到了產物的策動。
2. 一開始的家族放置是非常重要的一環，但如果您無法搶得優渥的中間地帶，不仿採取防守4個工廠帶給玩家們的額外獎勵。
3. 有時後請看彼此間的擴展路徑，適時的妨礙，將會給予金錢上的優勢翻轉。
4. 在擴展的時候，適時的了解彼此間的航海能力。
5. 在於樵夫跟礦工來說，不要把他們全當成勞工去看待，有時後他們才是擴展的關鍵。
6. 如果玩家走的是商道，那商人的拿捏就非常重要了。
7.  要拿取或完成任務時，再請多看一次您的擴展，有時忽略這件事，將讓自己的擴展崩盤。
8. 最後的最後，不要小瞧遊戲中的每一塊錢，這將會是讓您後悔的一大關鍵 XDD

這遊戲最讓我驚豔的兩個點是:
a. 珍貴產物(任務上的菸草、甘蔗、棉花)的拿取關係
b. 牛和羊的生殺大權
這兩個機制，是一個良好的策略細節。

啤酒(Beer)家族作者也坦承沒有測試過，實際玩起來真的是有點威猛啊...
比威士忌(Whiskey)家族強勢的轉換率，比牛奶(Mike)家族帶來的金錢流更加強勢，在遊戲中可以說是數一數二的強力家族!
但我得要說，菸草家族(任務欄多一)是我喜歡的，雖然看不太出強勢的地方，但實際用起來較為容易連擊，但策略度跟運氣成分就高了一點。

When at Essen Spiel 2016 a friend and I were approached by Juma and asked to play a prototype of this. At the time there was no art and components were mostly paper or borrowed from other games. The influence of other games like Terra Mystica were clear but this was not a bad thing.

I was surprised to find this as one of the best games I played at Essen that year with both my friend and I quickly becoming thoroughly engrossed in the gameplay. Look forward to the final product.

Update: Now have final product and it is a great production.

Scottish economic sim euro. So much goodness;  Richly intertwined theme with a myriad of worker choices (even has loggers and miners!) and goods conversion and direction influenced by the end of the round objectives.  Intuitive buy/sell market.  Satisfying feeling of progress expanding and upgrading and choosing the best value land from the modular hex play area. Transition from grain, wool, mutton, and dairy into bread, cheese, and whiskey to import/export trade for hopps, and tobacco.  So much thinky game experience packed under 2 hours. This game kills 2(3?) of my euro mainstays and that means more space on the shelf. I love when this happens.  From the shoulder of greats.

Score subject to change for the better with multiple players. This was my most anticipated game for 2017!

The game might be just tad too tight to my liking, maybe. I love games with plenty of resources and having lots of stuff but it looks like Clans of Caledonia is going to find it's place next to games like Lorenzo Il Magnifico, Terra Mystica and Voyages of Marco Polo in which you don't ever have enough money, turns or time to do everything (or even half!) you want.

And yet I really, really like the game, even when playing solo and I'm 100% sure I'll enjoy it even more with multiple players. I've played one solo game, one 2p game thus far. The components are great, although the use of white and black player colors threw me off slightly, I'd preferred yellow and green instead. I'm also hoping that the clans are balanced, only time will tell.

ps. the KS deluxe metal coins look and feel awesome! Great addition!

No one thing about this game is new... but they way everything is put together is unique.  The crux of the game is building a production engine that can easily fulfill contracts for the main points in the game.  There is some side scoring for how you split up your pieces on the board and how big the piles of goods you have at the end of the game are but this is all about manipulating the market to keep up your cash flow and fulfill those contracts!  As I introduce the game to more people I'm more and more impressed at how well the iconography is all put together leaving very little confusion about what's going on.  That helps everything except the big piles of end game scoring go quite smoothly (luckily there's an app for that) and I'm looking forward to exploring this some more!

Ami a legnagyobb gond, h ennél sokkal jobb játékok vannak, mind hasonló témában, mind hasonló mechanikában.

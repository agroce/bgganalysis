RATING: 6
A good game but it loses at least half a point for it's implementation. I really wish all the action was displayed on one central board. The individual player boards really make it very difficult to work out what everyone else has got and this is crucial.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This would be a fine game if the action tiles would be just what they are: counters towards the game end. There's already enough of a game, enough alternation and interesting decisions from the worker tiles in there, but the effects from the action tiles makes this a pretty unpredictable and chaotic game. I'll stick to Keyflower.

From the Reviews: What a terrible mixed review/mix feeling game this is. I started off liking it a lot, then feeling lukewarm, then cold, but then warm again. Plays 2-4 and 90 minutes long, a little long to play with my wife. It is interesting and the theme is good for me and the auction aspect looks nice and simple.

RATING: 8
Superb game at the same level as Keythedral, which I love. Players compete for field tiles and must carefully build up groups of fields to make them easy to harvest and to add workers, which score points at the end of the game. Harvesting brings crop counters which in turn can be used to guard filed tiles while in storage against other players bids. Original and clever.

Played an ealier version of this about a year ago. It was good then and it will be better since that time. Multi company launch will reduce Key upset people. 

Now played the final product and it is much imporved on the earlier playtest version. The options are many in the game and there are plenty of ways in which you can plan for future actions. Probably not as deep as Reef Encounter, but a good gamer's game.

RATING: 5
An odd game.  It's part set collection, part area control, part marketplace/auction and part weird.  The mechanics are definitely interesting.  With the player-controlled market and the required use of it, there's an intermediate step to acquisition of a tile and acquisition is never guaranteed.  Furthermore, the workers help provide additional options and abilities.

However, I don't like the events.  They're random and some are a bit too powerful.  They can truly mess with you or do almost nothing.  The game can swing back and forth based on them.  Plus, they're the clock for the game.  While there's a threshold to overcome on turn 7, you're guaranteed at least 10 events and I guarantee they won't all be fun.

If the game were less random or more oriented around the market aspects or maybe a little more controlled, I'd probably like it better.  As it is, it's a bit too wild for my tastes.  I would play it again, but it wouldn't be my first choice.

I'll briefly note that I find the theme to be utterly dull.  While it's well connected to game play, it really just feels dry.  There's no spark here to redeem the fact that you are harvesting crops.  Imagine a game about harvesting crops - yes, that is how "exciting" Key Harvest is.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
1st play: Not Breese's finest design. I like it decently, but I think I was the only one. It felt a little like acquire in that you're hoping the right tiles come out and if they don't you can be at a disadvantage. Start position has a decent impact on the game and there are a differing number of turns per player, which I don't like. 

2nd play: I liked this MUCH better the 2nd time we played. The initial setup was different, and when set up correctly, the tension for the tiles is super high. Everyone was buying from each other's markets and farms wove across boards. Not a top 10 game, but definitely solid.

Intriguing mechanic. This is my favourite of Richard Breese's games (I prefer it to Keyharvest, Reef Encounter and Aladdin's Dragons), but it's still a good game rather than a great game.

Don't worry about the event tiles, I never saw them be worse than a minor irritation.

Despite the alcoholic nature of the crops, because they all behave the same they quickly devolved into red, orange, yellow, green and brown. The theme is a bit weak.

RATING: 5
A perfectly decent game with unique game play (in a good way) and very attractive artwork. For some reason, I didn't like it and wanted it to just end! Not sure why - maybe I was overtired and in a bad mood because of the rules, which are very unwieldy and repetitive - it took a while to figure out harvesting (do you need a worker - probably not). Very fiddly, especially when you harvest a large connected field. Also, the major mechanic, collecting crops, doesn't really amount to many victory points at the end of the game. Better off making your second largest field big and putting workers and farmhands on the board. Feels like a good game with two players. I'm still not sure why I don't like this more, but I distinctly remember that I really disliked it intensely while playing it (especially in mid-game). 

UPDATE: I gave this a second chance and ugh! The problem is that by the time the "middle" of the game comes close, all I want is for it to be over. I figured out what I don't like - a predetermined, single path to getting points where you don't really have any options except to do the next logical move. For example, because the field tiles are unique, it is usually pretty obvious which ones to go for first, and then it's pretty obvious what you need to do next.

Timing is key.  When and what to take must be struggled with every turn.  Enjoy how you get to price your tiles in your store to attract or deter opponents from purchasing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An OK game with some clever elements, like the disguised once round auction for plots of land in which the "auctioneer" sets the price and must pay it if no one else is buying.  The efficient use of workers, both for the rule-breaking powers and for their victory points is quite challenging.  The artwork is up to the usual Juliet Breese standard.  However, in the final reckoning, Key Harvest just doesn't engage me.  The feel, with that Acquire-style grid is very dry and abstract.  The random events bother me too; for my taste they add a bit too much chaos.

I playtested this game.

+ Interesting bidding mechanism where opponent players have a chance to take a tile from your store before your next turn. Of course, you can prevent this by making it too costly for them.
- Events where tiles are removed from your board can really mess up the long term planning
- Hard to follow which tiles have already gone and which are possibly still available. Blank tiles on the player boards could help.

Some interesting mechanics produce interesting decisions in this game.  The spatial decisions remind me of Acquire, and yes, as in that game, there is some luck in the game due to tile draws, but the pricing decisions feel original and worth exploring in future plays.  All in all, an interesting game and game design.

RATING: 7
While I love this game, it is by far the most brutal cutthroat game around. It is incredibly inviting and friendly looking until you go stab all your friends in the back. The late game turns usually are a question of: Do I earn 5 points or deny another player 50 points?

If your gaming group works well with those types of games then I highly recommend it as an 8+. Unfortunately because of this limitation I have to give it a lower rating.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
A fun game of bluff and constrained choices. Much like Keythedral, a knife-fight over shared resources. After another fantastic session, my rating has risen; I think this may become a real favorite.

I really need to make a consolidated rules sheet so I can teach this one with fewer problems than I ran into today. It's a complicated game and the rules are spread all over the rulebook.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Key Harvest has the kind of neutral interaction between players that makes it well suited for families but with quite a bit of depth for the gamer.  The latter is a learned quality of the game as it requires a good working knowledge of how to price particular field pieces and to manage the workers (both personal and town/shared).  Be prepared for the game to take a full 2 hours for the first play, but later plays will speed up considerably.  If possible, learn the game from an experienced player instead of reading the rules.  For some reason, the rules read particularly awkwardly.  Overall, a solid enjoyable game that has room for exploring depth within a reasonable game time.

RATING: 7
Probably the most consistently brain-intensive game I've ever played.  Difficult decisions for the entire duration of the game - there are *no* easy decisions.  Easy to underestimate the value of the workers in the end scoring.  Also easy to overestimate the value of the field tiles - in your primary field they're only worth 1,  and there may be better choices.  My only concern is that it almost feels more like work than play - I ended the game with a blinding headache I didn't have at the start!  I very much want to play again to see if familiarity eases the problem,  but I don't really think it will.  This really is an excellent game,  but I don't know if I suggest playing it!

RATING: 9
The key to early success is reusing your workers by placing these on the spaces for which you are acquiring field tiles.  I also recommend buying any field tile that is going cheap (one crop).  This will increase your options later in the game for connecting tiles.

Unconnected tiles are also useful for those events where a tile can be exchanged.  The workers provide for plenty of tactics and the pricing mechanism plenty of angst!  A typical Key series game thematically, plenty of decisions and interaction through the crop acquisition mechanism.

It could have scored better if there wasn't that much confusion about the cards and events.

First Play: Rules are well structured and easy to pick up, but a crucial element to playing well is understanding how the workers and townsfolk operate. Possible downside is it may be prone to AP so I'd recommend not playing this with ponderous opponants. Once the rules are cemented, impose a timer.

Rating will probably rise with more plays.

I enjoyed it, but it didn't blow me away. It is a tense, tight game of making one of four choices on your turn. While there isn't a lot of player interaction, your turn ends up being very tactical based on what the other players decided to purchase or sell. A gamer game for sure. Like most gamer games, I need to play it more before settling on a firm rating. It is a 7 for now.

Players try to get big connected areas on their individual playing boards by aquiring tiles which are only available once. However after a few turns it is pretty much established where each persons land masses are going to be and competition for the tiles dwindles. Add to this the limited number of actions to choose from and the rather annoying endgame (it comes either too soon or too late) and you have a game that doesn't tickle my tast buds.

The game is alright to play for 2, but for 3 I found it to be unbalanced. Two players are vying for two parts of the board while the other has free rein over half the board.

The workers in this game are tiles, just like the fields, which contribute to the fiddliness and make the look of the game uninteresting and boring. Also many event require looking up in the rules because the text is not clear on the game tile.

It is only because my wife loves this game that I give it a 5.

I really enjoyed this game. Lots going on, lots to think about, plenty of player interaction as you need to watch carefully what other players are doing.

Looking forward to the next time.

Mucho trebajo por poco dinero....

This is a very handsome game with a very meticulous aire.  It is interactive in a differing way form other games, not so much in your face, but subversive and surgical.

I like how thoughtful the game is, but I think for some players it would be a slower game.  This game has a very close point spread and scores tend to be very close to one another.  The fact that it is a low scoring game and a game with very little point spread would make me think some folks that wanna go "Rambo" or "commando" would have a hard time adjusting to its merry charm.  

There simply isn't the feeling of out and out competition but as in Ticket to Ride you may find your efforts frustrated.  Players who like and play balanaced games will do well with Key Harvest.

This game feels like enjoying a bowl of mother's chicken soup.

RATING: 7
A very interesting economic game where the currency is goods instead of money and what you're "buying" is hexagonal tiles that you lay to make connected areas on separate player boards.  Endgame is points for the # of tiles in your largest area and double points for # of tiles in your second largest area.  The way you get goods is by "harvesting" them from these tiles but each tile can only be harvest once per game.  Special tiles let you break this and several other rules.  What makes the game delicious is pricing the tiles such that it is either exactly what another player is willing to pay or too high so that you get to place it yourself.  One of my favorite Key games.

For me the graphics of the board weren't good and it was hard to keep track on things. Mechanics are interesting and flow of the game is smooth. Until you reach the last turns where AP is almost certain for most of the players. Not the kind of game I really like but has definitely some merits.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Sort of similar to Acquire in how you're trying to position your tiles, but you have more control over what you get.  It's rather open-ended with the different "currencies" in the form of crops, and it's difficult to assess what value to put on a given tile.  I really enjoyed my play, and found plenty of opportunity for clever tactical decisions.

One concern is that the complexity surrounding the 5 different types of crops doesn't have a corresponding payoff in the impact they have on the game.  In other words, you're forced to make a decision on what types of crops to place on the tiles in your store, and it's not a trivial one, but people generally are able to circumvent your requirements by using the worker allowing them to pay 1 more.  So it's a bit of a "false choice" and mental energy is spent on deciding what crops to place that would be better spent elsewhere.

Also, not sure if the order of field tiles may conspire to hose someone simply because of what their starting tiles are.  That's a concern I'll have to watch for.

This is one of those one-or-two-times-per-year games that is enjoyable in small doses, but I suspect would get old if played too much.  A solid 8 for what it does.  Rating will probably fall a bit with time.

Richard Breese makes good games - it just happens to be that his games never get me very excited to play them.  I'm always happy when I do, as they are solid, well constructed games, but without a huge spark.  Almost every one of his games has one great idea or mechanism, surrounded by merely average trappings.  That said, this is my favorite of his designs, and I like Keythedral.  It is a bit less cut-throat then Keythedral (or, at least, more subtly so).  I like the scoring mechanism, and the game-ending trigger is also well done and makes the game just the right length.  Plays well with 2, and the events he sprinkles throughout add just enough variation (something Keythedral lacks a bit, particularly in the endgame).  Given the price (usually $10-20 on EBay), I'd pick this one up in a heartbeat.

I was lucky enough to playtest an earlier version of this game at Essen 06 with Richard Breese and while this is essentially the same game it's interesting to see the wee changes which Richard has made here and there.  All in all I think they make for a better game which works well but which doesn't look likely to be amongst my favourite Breese designs - having said that though this is a fairly complex game and there are aspects I didn't pick up on first time which I see now - so there is no doubt more to explore and every chance that a deeper understanding of the game will improve my rating.

But the more annoying thing to me was the lulls in game play where you need to check everyone's boards to see if certain tiles are in play.  It just seemed a little tedious to me.  If I played again, I might play with stones or something to put on my board to mark which tiles are already in play.  Overall, the game works just fine, but didn't get me too excited to play again.

While I had a lot of fun playing this, we made a lot of errors during play in terms of rules. Why? Because there are so many exceptions and tiny little rules. Now, clearly the game is robust enough that it is still fun even with a half dozen rule mistakes, it won't hit the table often enough to be able to remember all these rules from game to game.

However, for those curious, this game is fun because of all the tiny little rules and how they interact. You can usually plan about one turn in advance, and so every turn is a little problem to solve. You have all these tools, how can you combine them to maximize your points? It's an enjoyable exercise.

The parts of this game that are like Reef Encounter and Acquire are very likable.  Once I started playing, I felt that this might be a new top 10 favorite for me.  However, I'm not sure the land selling mechanic really works.  At the end, someone had a ton of goods that weren't really good for anything.  You have to hope for the other players to do so much for you that acquiring tiles doesn't feel natural.  If this gets cleaned up before release, I will look to buy it.  If this part of it isn't changed, I will probably leave it on the shelf.  It was a mood breaker for me.

There is a neat area grabbing mechanic in the game where you are competing for space shared with all other players.  This could have been done on a central board, but in this game, it was abstracted into individual player boards with labelled tiles.  When I thought about it, all this abstraction did was create a need for constant checking on tiles to every other players board.  On the plus side, there are some really interesting plays you can set up with your worker tiles.

This was quite enjoyable. It has an Acquire like placement on a grid but each person controls there own little linked up fields. The fields get placed by being put up for sale by one player and then the others get a chance to buy them at the price the player offered it at before the player who put it up for sale gets a chance to buy it at that price. There is some interaction here trying to sell players what they want expensive and trying to stop them buying what you want but not overpaying. You also have "worker" tiles (not particularly like workers in worker placement games) you can place that have special abilities and with a little foresight give you some fun comboing. A nice, relaxing tile placement game with enough little twists from the events to keep you on your toes. Yet again Juliet Breese's art does do a lovely job at taking the edge off the screwage in what is a fairly tense game.

Oh man.  I love the extoritve marketplace feature of this.

Without it, it would be a gentle, low-interaction themeless euro about joining tiles.  Interaction would be limited to "blocking" of tiles by selecting them ahead of your opponents.

What makes Keyharvest different is how tiles do not go directly to your board.  They are placed in a secondary market, where you must price them with goods on hand.  This leads to some agonizing decisions.  What makes it even more agonizing is that you only have two slots for goods.  If you choose a tile that your opponent desires, and price it sky high, they may decide the best thing to do will be to let it rot in your store, and take up one of those scarce spots in your marketplace.  There are some really neat constraints here in the system, which turns this into a (albeit still themeless) knife fight.

Key Harvest is an interesting new game from Richard Breese which reminds me in some respects of a combination of Keythedral, Reef Encounter, and San Marco; not in a specific mechanical context, but in terms of feel.

Key Harvest is a game where you want to do one thing: get a couple of monster fields onto the board. Each player has an individual board showing A-1 through G-8 on it, each spot being a small hex, and all the player boards are identical. The idea is to purchase the right tiles, get them down onto the board, and then harvest goods from them using either the "harvest an entire, connected series of fields" action, or by placing workers down adjacent to them. Harvesting nets you goods, which are the way that you purchase the field tiles. 

Field tiles initially come into the game on a display, and they can be drafted off the board, but with a catch: you can draft them into your store, but that doesn't mean that you can have them immediately. You have to name a price by placing goods from behind your screen with them, and the other players will each have an opportunity to buy the tile out from under you by paying you the same goods on their own turns. This is where the game reminds me of San Marco, and it is certainly where the game is won and lost. Ideally you want to set yourself up to sell tiles the other players want at a "as much as they're willing to and/or able to pay" price while also being able to defend the tiles you really want in your own store by setting prices that the other players cannot or unwilling to pay.

The game has a number of other things going on though, the most notable and interesting being the way the workers function. Getting them onto the board is the other major source of victory points, for starters, and they require adjacency to between 1 and 5 hex sides, so growing your field with space left for workers is definitely a good thing. As their numbers increase, the thing they do when they come onto the board become increasingly snazzy, and they essentially break the rules in some way, or at least net you goods. Additionally, if you purchase a land tile and place it onto your board such that a worker is covered, the worker can then be relocated to any legal spot on your board. This is huge, and where a lot of the skill in the game seems to reside. Clever plays can set up chain reactions of worker placement, and can leave the player executing the chain in very good shape. This is where the game reminds me of Reef Encounter, as it's a game of finding the clever move.

So all of that was just description, how do I feel about it? I think the game is solid, and I quite enjoyed playing it. I like games where it is possible to come up with dastardly combinations, and Key Harvest has that in spades. I am also very fond of the offer for sale mechanism, though it hurts my head trying to think through what the other players probably have, how high of a price I should name, and all of that. But it's a good hurt.

Negatives, not many. I could see this game dragging very, very badly with the wrong group, but that's common for any "menu style" game where there are a number of available options each round. I also think that pennies or some sort of markers are necessary for each player, so they can mark the tiles that have come out. Related, I don't think I would want to play this with any number but 3. With 2, it would be too easy to make monster fields. With 4 it would be an even bigger headache to keep track of who wants what, and all of that.

I like it though, it has a few of the things I like rolled into one package. I'm not sure if it'll eventually move up, but I'm starting it at a conservative 7. I don't need to own it presently, but I would definitely like to get back to it.

On an aside: the wonderful art by Juliet Breese again impresses me.

Demetra never really struck a chord with me. There are two reasons for this. One is the unclear visual execution with too low a contrast between tiles and background. It helps a mite if you, as the rulebook suggests, put all boards together, but still some harder colours would have helped a lot. The second reason is really the biggie: I don't find the gameplay all that interesting. There aren't any complex patterns to figure out, and the rules are constructed such that various approaches to the game are effectively nullified. For example, an interesting strategy could be to create a honeycomb of sorts. This makes you very flexible with tiles on offer, and the open structure of a honeycomb means it is easy to put down and replace workers, thus making actions efficient. But it renders you poor on resources: you are effectively relying on the two 1- and one 2-worker to give you these, and they don't amount to much. You are also limiting yourself quite a lot in terms of points: the idea is to form continuous masses (at least when the game ends), and placing workers with value 4 or 5 is tricky in this situation. So the game nudges you gently back to its pattern of several larger landmasses which offer a good balance between worker replacement and VPs; if not in the beginning then most certainly in the end (where it renders you very vulnerable). The end result is that every game to me feels samey, at least at the lower end of the player number scale: it's all two or three landmasses with a bit of butting heads at the edges of these areas. Then there are a few nasty [i]Hey! That's My Tile![/i]-events, but these are really all the excitement that the game has to offer. Nothing much actually happens. You grow, you utilise extra actions, you score VPs, that's it. You don't feel even particularly clever for a small place-replacement chain.

In the end that is what is making me indifferent about Demetra. It doesn't challenge me much, it doesn't allow me to do much, and it takes too long to play for what it offers. It might be a somewhat interesting time once every while, but it's certainly not worth getting as your main auction-set collecting title.

The rule book was very easy to follow and included summaries of each section to help you find the part you were looking for.

2017 - Played with sons.  Quite a bit of chaos brought on by the event tiles.  Setting the right price for the fields is the most interesting element, but the currency of the crops seemed pretty worthless.  Would like to play a few more times with different player counts, but the theme didn't really grab my sons.

Played once.  Interesting enough that I acquired a copy for $10.  Will need to brush up on the rules again to play with the family.

I really wanted to like this because Keythedral and Reef Encounter are two of my very highly rated games.

But, it didn't excite me. There wasn't anything particularly wrong with it, it "worked" but just didn't scratch any particular itches. There seem to be way too many event tiles though, and they came out rather fast. Even with the slow-down mechanism, it seemed to rush.

This is a unique game. There's an interesting mechanic where when I fill a location on my board, you now have to work around that location on your board (and vice versa). The periodic random events add a good amount of tension and variability. Really good.

Interesting game - liked the drafting mechanism (everyone gets a chance to buy the tiles you want to place), and how you can set up the board to reuse workers multiple times in a single play. Think the key to this is two fold - you have to know when to switch from supplying other people with tiles, to preventing them from getting yours, and you have to make maximum reuse of your workers through replacement.

There are some nice ideas here worth a try but it didn't have staying power with us. Setting prices and "stealing" other people's goods is a a lot of fun as is planning the use of your and the public bonus worker tiles. You can bounce those workers around to get some extra actions and outplay your opponents. 

The other aspect we liked is the way you score the two groups. It'd be too easy for someone to get a single, large group but here they penalize you for that. But otherwise, the game became tedious trying read everyone's board to see what tiles could help them.

(2-4 players) This shares a weirdness with Reef Encounter in that I can never really grasp what's going on with the cube economy. It's not as bad here but it is definitely difficult for me to wrap my head around. Due to players setting the bids (cost in resources) for tiles you can never quite gauge what resources you will need and when so there ends up being a bit of luck. Worker privileges mitigate this to some degree and that is largely what you do in this game: try to get tiles you need with resources and use workers to assist you in that regard.

I like the Bingo element of trying to patch together two blobs of roughly equal size with competition for the Bingo balls.

An odd beast but not without its charms. I really like the Autumnal theme and will be happy to revisit this game each year.

A massively over-blown rules set and needlessly complex set-up hide what is actually a simple, easy game. At the heart is the clever scoring mechanism, 1  victory point per tile in your biggest tile field, but 2 points per tile in your second biggest. Add in more bonus points for workers which give you special extra actions, and a bunch of random events which throw intersting choices/spanners into the works, and the whole thing is a nice challenge for experienced gamers. The whole A1 F6 alphanumeric thing is off-putting and ugly, but I struggle to see a better method that's easy to intepret. The end game came down to optimal choices, and you could work out who was leading, but the final scores were close. I would like to play this again, after learning lots from my first go, but Richard, puhlease get an editor to make the rules TEXT shorter. Repetitious, over picky, and 12 count them 12 pages are a big turn-off.. The basic rules could have been done in three or four pages, and the workers/events could have gone on a player reference. When will you learn?

Key Harvest is clearly part of the Key series, both in appearance (which is overly busy and not particularly helpful in some places) and in theme, and while the inner workings are quite different the game can't deny a certain kinship to its predecessors.

The basic idea is pretty simple: Everybody tries to build large patches of fields on a gridded board. As there is only one tile for each coordinate in the grid conflict arises when several players want to build their fields in the same area.

The market mechanism is quite charming: When you decide to grab a tile you first place it in temporary storage and fix a price for it. After that each player gets the chance to buy the tile from you for that price. If you still own the tile on your next turn you can pay the price yourself to actually place it on your landscape.

Key Harvest has 5 types of resources but apart from the beginning of the game where certain resources may be unavailable they rarely matter. Simply having more is usually much more important than having any specific type of crop which is unfortunate.

The game play is mostly tactical since any grand plans can easily be thwarted when a tile comes out at the wrong moment and gets snatched away by someone else, and it seems to run a bit longer than it should. The random events are fine and much less scathing than in Keythedral.

The bidding system in Key Harvest is what makes it. It's a neat idea and I haven't seen anything like it before. The rest of the game is pleasant enough. I like that there are few choices to make yet enough variety in those choices to make things feel meaningful. The artwork is beautiful as well. This works as a nice two player game. Can be nasty! While I like the ease of play and the bidding system, the events are an annoying interruption to an interesting game. Not sure if everything could have worked without them, but this sort of random kick in the pants mechanic just is becoming and less and less of a thing I'm interested in.

This is very much my style of game. I like the sale mechanism. It's like an auction where you say how much you'd pay, but then if someone else would pay that just to stuff you around, well, at least you have their money. And that lets buy other things. Watching four boards to try to figure out who's doing what is very difficult and tends to slow the game down, but everybody has to take that time.

A market place bingo of sorts, with confusing albeit attractive board design.  This game is terribly susceptible to AP.  The only real interaction is in setting the price of your goods, and causing minor inconveniences to opposing players.  I also found that poor draws early and bad initial location can lead one to sit aside and watch the rich get richer, as the pricing they can afford is pennies to everyone else. I just wasn't seeing the fun in this.  I suppose Breese just isn't the designer for me.

I was fascinated by my first play of Key Harvest, with three players, and am eager to get it to the table again. My initial impression is that this is the best game in the Key series. There's a lot of emphasis on setting up tricky sequences of moves, which is a feature I enjoy in games. Another challenge is figuring out how to manage the game's bizarre, somewhat gimmicky economy of opportunity, enticement, and coercion.

Key Harvest is likely to be experienced by most players as a demanding and not entirely intuitive game. It comes at you sideways. That's part of the game's appeal, but it also makes it harder to get played compared to the average mainstream Euro. It's not going to be suitable for any crowd and any situation. I also suspect that the four-handed game might present too much information to track, at least for new players. The rather draconian and difficult-to-anticipate random events are definitely going to be a problem for some players. I have a higher tolerance for chaos than many gamers, and I like the events, but be prepared to have some of your careful planning undone when fate intervenes.

The mechanics in this one fit together very well for me. Auctions, tile laying, resource management, worker placement, action points, variable game length. I love the actions offered by workers and special tiles. 

A Euro that has significant room for player interaction: stealing opponents' tiles, buying tiles to hurt others, directly affecting another's player board. The fact that there is only one of each tile in the game can make for some tense moments, cruel actions, and glorious successes. Can also attribute some of the game's luck to this fact. Maybe there should be a few wilds?

There's some cool stuff in this game.  I'd rate it higher if it weren't so fiddly... you're constantly checking all of the players' boards to see who has which pieces and which are still left in the bag.  As it stands, it just takes too long, whether you're familiar with the gameplay or not.  Also, it is a game in which fairly random events can screw you over pretty hard, which is a big "no" from me.

Manage your tiles, manage your workers, manage your spatial design, manage your resource and make sure you do it optimally. 

Very fun and colorful game. Recommended to play in autumn as it brings out the colors. Some tough choices (where do I  put my worker, which worker), some luck (what tile will be available), some cost management (what price to set on individual tile). 

Great game. Very enjoyable in play and to look at.

I never had the right crops to buy tiles from other players stores, and i drew few tiles that were going to help me.  so, overall the game was frustratingly stagnant for me.  having said all that,  i was very tired when i played, so i'm willing to try it again with fewer people and feeling better rested.  i hope my next play is a more positive experience, because i like breese's other games and i this one just arrived at my house.

Another cool Key game. There is some luck involved, but it's not game breaking. You have to choose the right prices for your stuff and buy the tiles you need, before someone else get the chance.

However, while this is a good game, I'm not sure if it would hit the table very often, as there's only one way to score big points.

Played it once so far, and probably won't play it again.  It's pretty ho-hum.  There's a lot going on -- you have to pay attention to everybody else's country board (to see their motivations and remember what tiles are not going to come out of the bag), to their store boards (to see what can be placed immediately, and for what cost), to the registry (to see what fields are coming up), and to players' money/barrels of goods (to decide how to price fields and when to harvest).

It's a little like Acquire in that you don't know what real estate will be available, and when.  However, it's not quite as bad as Acquire, because you often have the chance to react to upcoming tiles.  It's more like Goa, because of all the auctioning, except that there are 5 currencies instead of one!  It makes valuation that much harder.  And then, after all your clever plans to set the price to something that nobody else has, they can use workers to buy your field using goods that are unrelated to the stated price!  

The game involves lots of mechanics, and lots of careful thinking, but not much fun.  It may be better with 3 players (because it would involve a lot less analysis), but I'm not likely to try it again.

Key Harvest is a set collection game with an open market aspect, but still having a certain amount of luck in the tiles one has available to purchase and score as connected sets at the game end.

While I'm sure with skill there is some mitigation of poor draws, it may not offer as strong a mechanism as, say Acquire does to offset NOT drawing the tile(s) one needs to connect sets.

On a preliminary basis, I am starting Key Harvest at a 6.75- not the strongest game in the Key series, but not a bad one by any means.

Beautiful painting-like drawings.

Each turn, choose one:
- evaluate fields to place them in your stock
- buy 1-2 fields from anyone's stock & place it on your map
- send one of your peasants to harvest more crops
- rest a peasant (?)
- get 1 more good.

No comment on initial play.

Update (10/01/11): I recall playing this at Geekway three years ago. There are a bunch of hex tiles on the board that are randomly distributed, and flipped depending on the circumstance. Resources are generated and converted into special powers or more capabilities, so it this sense it is a classic Euro. Was it exciting? Mildly. Will I play this again? Most likely not.

Update (01/20/12): Time is a weird thing. I rated it a '6' several months ago, but now it may be time to revisit this design.

I think this is best with less players.  AP can be bad.

It reminded me of the more recent Castles of Burgundy with some elements of Reef Encounter, both of which I would slightly prefer.

I think we broke the game with 4p: ran out of cubes, ran out of hexes in the bag & nearly got in an infinite loop with the 7 events = 7+ tiles rule.

1st played 01/10/08. Taught in ~20min, played in ~1.5hrs w/ 3 players. Good luck/strategy balance. Complex game that takes a gameplay before your figure out what exactly it is you are suppose to do. Most VPs wins, which you get by 1pt for each tile in your largest group of connected tiles, 2pts for each in your 2nd largest group, pt value on each worker you have in your field, & 1pt for each good you have most. Each player starts out w/ play area, workers, a good of their color, 3 random goods (from approx. same # of goods in bag, & 2 starting fields. More expensive worker can also be used from the board. 6 land tiles are placed on the town board & remainder placed in bag along w/ special action tiles. Game is over 2 rounds after 10 special action tiles are pulled from the bag. Turn options: 1) harvest 1 connected set of land tiles (get goods of that type), 2) hire a worker (require tiles surrounding placed worker = vp amount; worth VPs placed; & do actions when placed) 3) purchase 1-2 goods from anyone's market, & 4) place 1-2 goods for sale in your market (use goods you have to set the price). I'd highly recommend giving this a gameplay if you know someone who has it & depending available time give purchase consideration.

I got this from one of my Secret Santas here on BGG and was very, very excited to get it. They got me the fancy box version of it. I was thrilled. I would rate this game higher and probably play it more though, if the game pieces were in English. Having to look up what an event does anytime one is drawn makes the game take a little longer and harder for people to understand what they can expect to happen during the game or what they can buy from the town.

First play with 3. I like Richard Breese's games but Key Harvest, although clearly a Breese design, did not appeal to me on this initial outing. Because each player has his own board, a lot of time is spent scanning the boards to determine whether or not tiles in the land registry are of value to the other players - this quickly becomes irritating and slows down the game. I suspect that Key Harvest may only show its worth after a couple more games i.e. with a complement of players who are fairly familiar with it.

initial rating 

Well a solid game overall as you would expect but nothing about it really stands out and it ends up being fairly dry except for a little screwage.  Actually the one part that did stand out was that when you put a good in your store you had to set a price, if you go cheap you will buy it cheap however someone else might buy it first, if you put it too expensive then you'll end up paying that cost (very much like Medici vs Strozzi here).

In the game you are trying to build two big areas on your own player board by acquiring tiles from a common pool, you either buy these from your opponents or from yourself as described above. This pool of tiles comes out randomly onto the main board and then you decide from there which ones you want to try and get. All this information is open so you can see where your opponents are building and either directly compete or try to build elsewhere. This whole 'building aspect' kinda reminded me of Acquire really only eveyone has there own board and there are no "takeovers". However, the tiles are numbered in the same kind of way and each one is unique as well so you WILL lose tiles to the other players eventually because they also will need the same tiles as you in some spots, this ensures some competition. 

Randomness is present as mentioned in tile-pulling from the bag which determines the order in which tiles can be bought, the game end AND when certain events happen which usually effect all players in some way so not too critical but alas there it is.  

Overall some nice touches on this but I think long term planning is lacking and in the end I would rather play Kethedral even though are they completely different games.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (December 2013)

Good game, easy rules (great player aids) with some complex gameplay, the game is not intuitive at all. By far the sale mechanism is the best feature of the game, you have to carefully weight how much you are going to pay and what products your competitors have, very interesting stuff. I also like the “memory” aspect required to win, if you manage to remember what player produced/paid which resources, you will have a definitive advantage, however tracing this information is very hard. 

I’m not sure I dig the random events, they seem to chaotic for my liking and they can undone your careful planning, but at least they hit all players equally. On the other hand, I don’t mind the luck inherent in the random drawing of the tiles as you can react to it.

Richard Breese is a GREAT designer, I have enjoyed every one of his games (that I have played :D). I enjoy Keyflower a bit more, but this is a very good game too.

Bottom line, a very good game for gamers, this is not a game to play with newbies, otherwise you could scare them. I want to play it soon. A keeper in my collection, perhaps it can go up higher in my personal ratings.

I finished reading the rules. As it turned out, the explainer made some minor mistakes in our game. The workers never turn an un harvested tile. The rules are clear for the most part. Some exceptions with the events can be confusing, sometimes they are returned to the bag, other times they are played. I think that if you are re filling the market offering and an event appears you have to play it, otherwise you need to return it to the bag. 

Current Rating: 7.0

After more plays, I’m comfortable with the events. YES they are too chaotic and unpredictable, but they hit all the players the same way. The player, who is at a disadvantage, is the one who draws the event (in the case he has to pass a field tile, the most devastating event I have encountered).

Another powerful/chaotic event is the one that changes all the registry tiles, that can destroy your plans in a bit.

Still I enjoy the game a lot, it has the potential to go even higher in my personal ratings.

One of 2007´s favorites.

When I heard there was going to be a game about land registries, I said, "Sign me up!"  I mean, the intrigue, the dirty tricks, the intricate bureaucracy! I can't get enough of purchasing zoned agricultural areas and hiring workers to exploit properly planted fields.  

In all seriousness, despite the dry concept of a theme, this is an excellent game.  The theme even works, once you get past the laughter that your friends will heap on your initial, "Ok, this is a game about land registry."  In spite of everyone having separate maps of the registry  , there is a large amount of interaction - some of which is fairly subtle, as people try to sell you the plot titles you need, rather than deny them to you outright.

The only downside that we've found to this game so far is the art work.  It is very engaging, and I like Juliet's stuff.  The difficulty is that once you have a registry board that is starting to fill up, it can be difficult to see exactly what's going on, especially across the table.  The colors are not color-blind friendly, and the workers tiles blend right in with the land titles.

Rating after one play: 

There were several things about this game that just didn't make the game enjoyable for me for the amount of time it took to play the game.

1) I thought the auction mechanic was going to be more interesting than how it actually played out. 

2) There is a slow pace to the game as the active player tries to figure out what everyone else is going to do with the tile they put into storage 

3) The random end game mechanic feels strange. I think there are times you'd want to be able to play for endgame yet the tiles you need to do that provide potential benefits to all players.

4) There is an Acquire type of mechanic built in with the hex acquisition and I am not a fan of that game mechanic.

RATING: 6
I like the ideas in this game, but it doesn't play so well in practice. The problem is primarily in pacing. The boards and available tiles change so much between your turns, that you pretty much have to evaluate everything afresh at the beginning of each turn, which makes the game feel draggy compared to its relatively light weight. Tile draws, events, and their relation to the set turn order can have a little more impact that I'd ideally like. The market system is the primary piece of interest here, but the game around it is just okay.

Played first game tonight with my wife, David and Christine; final scores David 25, Me 24, Christine 18, Nicole 14.

Key Harvest is a highly tactical, surprisingly light affair with balanced scoring and a game engine that hides the gears well. The game is relatively easy to teach and learn and plays somewhere between 60-90 minutes depending on player count.

Recently I've been introduced to a number of new titles, Key Harvest, Santiago, Chinatown, that were fine but lacked that special something to distinguish them from the pack. 

WIFE RATING - 6

UPDATE: 

2.15.11 (rating drop from 6-5)
3 sessions in and I have to say that I find Key Harvest to be a bit of a bore. I sell/buy/arrange tiles on my bingo-esque board in hopes of fitting a high value worker there, rinse and repeat. Kinda feels like Agricola light, a game that I dislike to begin with but at least it plays faster.

Key Harvest is an odd mix of brain-burning action selection, valuation of tiles and random events. This mix assured that it missed almost any target group and is mostly forgotten after a few years. People are missing out on an original medium-weight euro that distinguishes itself from the flood of contemporary worker placement games, card-driven games or deckbuilders. The price-setting mechanism is challenging, the workers with their special functions allow for clever play. It has the attractive visual appearance of Breese’s Key games with the weakness also present in Keyflower that Juliet Breese’s artwork is hampered by the functional graphical elements. The main letdown for me is the anticlimactic scoring where a single tile can easily make the difference. Others might be deterred by either the dryness or the randomness mentioned initially.

A little too dry for my taste.  My main concern is the length of time it takes to play.  Because of the need to constantly evaluate everyone else's board, it can bog down at times.  If this game played in under an hour, I would be a lot more apt to play.  I find myself not really paying enough attention during the game.  When pricing tiles, I would just throw out a few different cylinders, the same number everyone else is asking.  Because my production was so limited, I didn't put much thought into which goods to use.  A lot of the problem with the reception of the game may be my own refusal to get involved.  Still, I'd like to try this one a few more times.

Hmm, not as fun as it looks. The game is certainly unique (I can't think of a proper comparison with another game), but dry to the point of being abstract.

You just do what you do and try to make the best score at end game.

Has interesting parts: the Isle of Skye-price setting, the common worker pool, the specific position of the tiles, the bumping possibilities, the scoring system. However, it falls crepe-flat, mainly due to the fact that it's repetitive, that the special effects are not that interesting, and because of those event tiles: both their random effects, and the random draw which means the game can go on for a much longer time than its interesting for. Cut the events, spice up the workers, and cut the length in half, and you'd have a winner!

Comparisons to bingo are to some degree accurate although there is much more thought and strategy involved in acquiring the tiles.  The most pressing question after one play seems to be whether to put a desired tile in your shop (and assigning a cost) hoping it gets back around to you in your next turn OR leaving it out there hoping one of your opponents will put it in their shop allowing you to purchase it on your turn (hopefully not at some exhorbitent cost)!  Use of worker tiles are also very pertinent to success as the player who is generally better at placing them strategically will generally fare better.

While one of Breese's lesser games it's still not a bad one. 

It's quite abstract and with almost all of the pertinent information decentralized and somewhat visually hard to track, it can be a little difficult to gather intel for your next move.

Another negative is that you essentially have to wait for your turn to plan as tiles can be stolen and the ones you had up for auction or others you hoped to buy may no longer be present.

I did enjoy my play and as long as the play time and downtime between turns reduces with future plays it will certainly remain in circulation.

After two two-player games, I haven't really made my mind up on [i]Key Harvest[/i] yet. It's a game which requires more analysis than most games my wife and I play. Tile choice is much more important than [i]Glen More[/i] and the competition for those tiles adds to the overall tension in the game (something I like). But what I don't like is the constant scanning the board to figure out where each tile can go - not just on your board but on your opponent's board. The artwork (which is cute and so "Breese") doesn't make tile analysis any easier. With more plays, this analysis will probably come quicker as I get more familiar with the board and the tiles, but I don't think it will ever get to the point of being second nature.  The market pricing is pretty novel, but with the goods hidden behind the screen, the real value of the items is opaque at best. We actually played without the screens for our first game and after the second game, we actually think we may continue to play without the screens...assuming my wife will play again...which she will not.

A unique part of the Key series.  This one is mostly about the buying and selling of goods.  Sure, you are growing an area on the board, but you are setting prices on items hoping others buy them when you need them to, or get back to you when you want them.

Not the best Key game, but certainly holds its own in its category.

Initial Rating after two 2-player games: 
Not as mean as Reef Encounter, in the same "medieval" style as Keythedral, and ingenious & thinky as well. It seems a bit dry at first, but there's plenty of backstabbing and strategy to this gamey game.

Rules are a lot easier to explain than Reef Encounter, but have the same kind of "feel" to it.

Good stuff, works great with 2 players, probably with 3 as well, wouldn't like to try with 4...

Oh, and I like the visual aspect that your player board gradually fills with the coloured fields.

Another entry in the Key series, more player interaction than in Keythedral - but still not direct conflict. The stores are an interesting idea, as well as the grid map if unique tiles that all players share for their individual game boards.

Component colour issues persist, the good cubes are too similar.

RATING: 5
Another beautiful Breese production.  This one picks up where Fowl Play left off... in it's abstract-feel.  Each player has their own play mat which is identical and represents one large lot of land that all players are working.  If I place a tile on spot A-2 then that spot is now filled and no other player can place a tile on their view of the A-2 space.  Players activate various roles to harvest their fields, etc. and are trying to create the largest network of connected fields.  

The major decision making is in drafting tiles and placing them in your market.  When you place them in your market you decide what the price is going to be (in resources).  Other players can buy these tiles at the price you established or you can pay the resources yourself next time around.  One problem is that it's difficult and time consuming to see what your opponents are trying to build since they are building on their own playmat.  Unfortunately this is where the meat of the game is because you need to see what tiles they would be interested in so you can try to profit off by drafting tiles they would want to buy, so you can try to screw up their plans and so you are aware of what spots are in contention.  

The game didn't haven't the same angst and excitement of Breese's earlier designs.  I would be more apt to play an online version of this.  UPDATE: knocked down a 1/2 point... I like many of the ideas but the gameplay is perhaps to analytical and gamey for the amount of luck and tactical play involved.  2008-06

UPDATE: I really don't like this design and hate having to constantly look across the table to each player's huge map to figure out what everybody else is doing.  Knocked down another point.  2011-01-04

The main mechanic of this game if very intriguing. Only one play so far and the rest of the table was unimpressed (Brandon disliked it greatly) which may be due to inexperience leading to poor pricing leading to economy deflation.

I finally played a semi-competent game of Key Harvest, but it remains fairly uninteresting to me. There are some basic tactics you have to keep in mind through out the game that will help advance your score, and there were certainly parts of my game I could have improved. However, the constant flux of the tiles and especially the random event tiles just kills this game for me. Your ability to plan is very limited, forcing play to be highly opportunistic. Since you're almost always looking short-term, it's hard not to feel like you're getting shafted (or lucky) based on the random assortment of tiles available. I will say that this was considerably better with three players--you just have more options and flexibility--but I'm still not really drawn to this game.

A very neat gem I stumbled across simply because it was cheap at Amazon. Very glad I bought it. Kinda an auction tile placement mechanic. If Bingo was a strategy game instead of a totally random affair, it would be like Key Harvest. The game is a tile driven resource gathering game with some very cool mechanics. The luck of the tile draws is reduced by good strategic play. Lots of fun.

Interesting game mechanism where the players bid and outbid each other to place tiles on their individual player mats. Other parts made less sense, such as the necessity to place tiles in "ring shapes" to be able to place workers adjacent to as many tiles as possible. I felt there were too little choice in the game while the other players often suffered from analysis paralysis (and yet I won fairly comfortably).

RATING: 6
Key Harvest is a very solid game with a really interesting buying / selling mechanic.  By far my favorite part of the game is putting the field tiles into your store and deciding how much you want to set the price for.  This allows you to select tiles that you really want and tiles that your opponents want, because you can price things to buy or sell.  The game is compact, tight, and plays quickly.  It is the essence of a Euro game.

Aside from the buying and selling mechanic, however, there isn't a whole lot that is special about Key Harvest.  It is well balanced and streamlined, but you don't get the same rush when playing it that you do other games.  This is a game that I'd be happy to play, but it will never have the depth or excitement of bigger, heavier games.

Rating based on one play with 4 players. Oh how I wanted to like this game. Reading the rules it seemed like it would be right up my alley. After playing, it turned out to be a tediously long game with an extremely broken economy. Once the commodities were in player's possessions, the whole middle section of the game favored the rich and punishd the poor. If your tiles didn't come up, you were screwed regardless of if you had the resources to spend. This game required WAY too much concentration and constant scanning of the other players' boards only to be undone by random tiles,luck of the turn order and events. A major disapppointment. I will try this with 3 players to see if things are better balanced but I don't hold out much hope that things will change dramatically enough to sway my opinion. A surpringly poor design from a designer that I tend to like quite a bit.

RATING: 8
First impression (3 players) : Key Harvest feels a pretty simple game as there "isn't much to do" but it can be quite a brain burner. Hardest part is to evaluate how cheap/expensive can you put tiles to you store to be bought as too expensive might mean that you must take it to yourself and that might almost kill your game. The way tiles are put to sale is the highlight of the game as it is very dynamic and you must put the price from your own resources (that are then locked until it is bought) which makes it just perfectly hard to determine prices.

Very interesting stuff. Valuation, turn-management and select usage of special abilities all play their part here, and crucially it's never quite clear whether to build for your own benefit or take fields to the detriment of others. The scoring system whereby you get more points for your second-biggest field group is very intriguing and prevents the scoring phase being merely ordinary. As ever in the Key series, the art and sheer feel to the game is beyond reproach.

Good game. Only downside for me (although this is only after one play so take it as you wish) is there could potentially be a bit of downtime/AP depending on your opponents while people work out who wants which tiles and what price to set for them.

A beautiful Fall game! A perfect game for October/November! A wonderful game that really captures the look and feel of harvesting from fields.
On your turn you have 2 actions to spend (harvest, add a worker tile to your field, add tiles to your store to sell, or buy tiles from your personal store or your opponents.

Before you are allowed to take a tile to your own board, you have to sell it to others and if they don't buy it from you then you may buy it yourself on your next turn. The tricky part is placing the bid on your own store tiles. You most likely want the tile for yourself, so it is challenging to place a bid that works for you and not your opponent.

You may play to your own boards, but this is far from solitaire. You need to keep constant watch on what resources people have and are able to generate, what they're interested in, and set prices for fields accordingly. The events provide just enough chaos to keep the game from dying on analysis paralysis but not enough to turn the game random, as well as providing the timer which seems to give the game the right length. Worthy of more exploration.

There's definitely a lot going on here, and a player is well-advised to keep tabs on what your opponents have and don't have.  You want to offer tiles both for yourself, for a better board, and for your opponents, for a source of income.  So really, the game is all about figuring out what your opponents need, and determining what they can and can't pay.  Obviously, this isn't for the AP-prone.  I didn't really like how the resources in the game were identical and basically worthless on their own; their sole purpose is to buy other people's tiles.

Interesting game. You harvest crops and spend them to buy new plots of land for your country board, hoping to build large contiguous farms. There is a fair bit of screwage in that you can also buy tiles your opponent has reserved (or force your opponent to pay a whole lot of crops for a tile they really need.) This is probably too aggressive a game for just D and me, but I'll be interested to try it with additional players.

RATING: 5.5
Strange mix of things that left me slightly cold. Valuing the tiles by bidding was oddly unsatisfying... it felt bad when I won the tile because I felt like I spent too many resources on it, yet when someone paid me for a tile I felt like I wasn't getting enough reward for it. I ended with way too many resources, so I must not have spent them well. The flow of resources was strange, in that resources only go out of the game if you buy tiles from your own store, but they come in all the time. So resources were everywhere. 

Also, the worker thing was weird... triggering/chaining them should have been interesting, but really either I place a worker where I know I can place a tile and hit him again, or I put him somewhere else hoping I can get exactly that tile. Not much else to it.

Hmmpf. Really wanted to love it since Breese is one of my favorite designers, but this just didn't do it.

I think I like this game.  It played a little long and it's a bit difficult (although completely necessary) to visualize all of the piece combinations on all of the players' boards (which change frequently), but the overall game was enjoyable.  The turn pacing seems odd when some actions are very quick, and some actions can be very drawn out and multi-tiered.  The board artwork feels busy, obscures the necessary information, and seems to unnecessarily slow down the information processing.  Player colors: Green, Yellow, Orange, and Brown.

RATING: 6.5
Economic game with an interesting market mechanic. You must draw harvest tiles, set prices for them, then offer them for sale in your store. If opponents choose not to buy them at the set price, you can buy them yourself for the same price (as well as buy tiles from opponent stores). Owned tiles are laid on your country board, where you try to build contiguous areas of the same crop in order to maximize resource production during the harvesting action. Special tiles further add to play: Worker Tiles can provide you with free actions (even multiple, if you can chain playing and overlaying the same one a few times) but have strict placement rules dictating how many adjacent tiles there must be, and they also break up a crop region; while Event Tiles introduce random events that can greatly help or hurt you, such as making fields disappear or changng market pricing. The 10th Event Tile drawn ends the game. Interesting artwork, almost watercolor-like.

Loved it thoroughly. Fewer actions than Reef Encounter, but almost as deep. It was unique like all of Richard's games I have played thus far. Original mechanics or slightly tweaked mechanics used in a unique way; either way Mr. Breese has done it again. Another 10 in my book. For fans of Tigris and Euphrates moreso than Acquire fans.

RATING: 6.5
Rating after one 2-player game.  The rating could go up or down, depending upon how well it ends up scaling to three or four players.  Initially, though, I enjoy the game.  I've already decided that some better decisions could have been made with the interface: rather than flipping tiles to show they're harvested, provide enough goods tokens to simply place a goods token on the tile when its placed...then remove the token to show it's harvested; provide black cubes or something for each player to be able to mark all taken or discarded spots on the board to eliminate tedious scanning of other players' upside-down boards.  Other than that, seems promising, and I look forward to teaching the main gaming group.

UPDATE: Got a four-player game in.  We used extra cubes to mark "taken" spaces, which helped.  Still, the other players didn't enjoy it much at all, so it was a pretty joyless experience.  I like it OK, but over-busy art and fiddliness mars an otherwise potentially interesting bidding/pricing mechanism.  I'd play again, but my mates won't.  Rating down a bit.

One major issue is having to constantly keep track of the location of the tiles not only on your board, but also on your opponents' boards.  This can be very time consuming and makes the game tedious.  The events are also very random and swingy.

Great game where you build fields on a hex grid. Everyone has a separate board with labelled hexes, and there's only one tile for each hex, so you're collecting a unique subset of the available tiles. You want contiguous tiles, but you also want room to place workers that are worth points, so you need to build squiggly or loopy fields. A two-step process of acquiring tiles adds to the challenge.

This game could be called "Settlers of Acquire".

RATING: 5
I did not like the economy.  There is a limited supply of goods and no clear way to cycle the goods.  It is also hard to get good of a type you are laking.I also found the play was some what over-complex in that there are 4 boards,4 markets, the register and the discard and the tiles on all these boards effect.  Some way to track all the components on a single board would have made play much less computation intensive without changing the game.  Only 1 play and I would try it again if I find out we did something wrong or were missing something.

A great planning game messed up with too many random events to spoil the planning part.

The parts of this game I really like are: 

- The buying of resource tiles - placing up to two tiles for sale in front of you with a bid that someone can pay you before your next buying turn, or that you pay on any subsequent turn. It's such a simple and effective method of acquiring tiles that I'm an instant fan. 

- The choice of harvesting resources and placing special worker tiles with their special abilities. I like the worker tiles with their quite powerful abilities. You can see what other players have and if they can play them. Worker abilities provide just the right amount of variation to stop the game from being too calculating.

- The two different actions you can choose out of four options. The game has the potential to be quite simple and yet have enough choice to be interesting.

- Believe it or not, the bingo tile board placement. It's effective, with one tile in the game per space. It works with the whole worker and resource tile placement very well. As long as you have some counters handy then it's not too hard to mark off each acquired or removed resource tile as you go.

What I'm not a big fan of and what stops me liking this game more:

- The game is just a tad too chaotic due to the special tiles. I like the worker tiles with their quite powerful abilities, but add the special tiles and the game becomes an exercise in planning futility. Harvest tiles can be wiped from the board, tiles swapped and all sorts of other shenanigans. I really feel that the game would have benefited from these game end countdown tiles being just a little more player neutral and subtle in their effects (as some of them are). After all, it's possible that several of them can be drawn in a row and for crazy to be piled on crazy on top of crazy.

So, it's a shame the planning to random events weighting couldn't be a little more stable on the planning side. I say this because I really do like everything else about this game. It's very simple, thought provoking and challenging, which is why it's all the more frustrating when so much chaos is thrown into the mix. Still, it might just be my favourite from the Key games and as always I'm a big fan of Juliet Breese's artwork.

Para mí es la precuela del Castillos de Borgoña. Consiste en subastar y coger losetas de un registro general y añadirlas a tu tablero/campo personal. Tiene más interacción que el juego de Feld, porque puedes comprar losetas de los almacenes rivales (que habrán tasado con recursos al cogerlas del registro general). Además dispones de trabajadores, tanto personales como generales, que nos ofrecerán habilidades especiales. También existe la posibilidad de realizar combos con los trabajadores.
Al final del juego (que viene marcado por la aparición aleatoria de eventos) puntúan los dos campos de mayor extensión, los trabajadores que estén en el campo y las mayorías en los recursos (se obtienen cosechando el campo).
Un juego de 2-4 jugadores, con turnos relativamente rápidos (sólo hay 4 acciones disponibles)y suficiente interacción, con cierto parecido al aclamado Castillos de Borgoña y que creo supera a éste en ciertos aspectos. Mejores componentes, más rápido y más interacción. Aunque todavía no sé porqué, pero el Castillos me gusta un pelín más...

There are a bunch of bits that work (the workers, the tile buying, the random events) but the fact that although there is an Acquire-style single set of tiles, players are competing for them, made it slightly too aggressive for my liking.  And my complete lack of spatial ability meant I had terrible trouble assessing which tiles other people needed - or, worse, already had!!  (That's cost it about half-a-point from me in the rating.)

After one play, I enjoyed it tremendously and would like to play it again, hopefully yielding a faster game next time. Playing with three people took us two hours.

The game relies heavily on information that's shared versus hidden. One must constantly scan other players' country boards, stores, and the registry to figure out what to do. Additionally, it's critical to fair play that players' crop resources be kept hidden. The little folded screens meant to hide these resources proved to be too small for our game; it was too easy to see over them and mistakenly glean advantages by knowing which resources another player had in hand.

The scoring at the end introduced a few surprises. I had forgotten how much the workers still on the country board are worth, and mistakenly removed a couple through field placement near the end. Leaving the workers in place would have yielded a better payoff.

I can't help but feel that this is bingo with resources.  In reality there is much more to it, but most of this is just a long and dry accumulation of territory.  I've come to expect the trademark level of charm in Breese's games, but there is none of it here.  It just felt like a raw collection of suits of cubes that will all be more or less useful.  Yes, there is room for timing, and some cleverness, but there just isn't a whole lot of joy to be had here.  

When I play Key Games (along with Breese's other creations) I expect to walk the tightrope of a cruel blade that other players are constantly twisting for their jollies.  Instead the interaction is that of shambling zombies that jostle into one other steering you slightly off course.  I think psychologically having the map split into private tiles does give you a sense of isolation. If this were played on one larger map it would feel like you were in the mix.  Yes, I know in reality that this isn't a multiplayer solitaire game, but I just can't help but get the sense that the only thing you are really doing to the player across the table is just minorly inconveniencing them. This is especially exacerbated by how tactical the game plays out.  You can surely make plans, and they help to speed things along when it gets around to your turn, but mostly you are just waiting to see what you can do when it's time to play. 

I found the mats tough to track, I had to use pennies to indicate which tiles had already been taken, so that I didn't waste my time on tiles that I couldn't get.

This is the kind of game that would benefit from being played online.  There are no interactions when it isn't your turn, and a long enough downtime to make it compatible.  Plus it would be easier to see other player's position.

Still, there are a number of great ideas here (the auction is nice) and I wouldn't be dismissive of playing it again.

UPDATE:  The more I think about the concept of playing this again, the less I'm interested.  I've turned it down now a few times and felt relieved.  Dropped my rating from 5.5 to a 4.

Like all Breese games, the board and chits are a wonder to gaze upon. I like how he mixed it up this time and made the event cards into tiles. The worker abilities and the market auction is where the heart of this game lies. Comments of one board for all, having player markers for you mat and making this into a computer version were all spot on. 4 is most definitely the sweet spot. While still not very interactive, there is some table talk, the strategy really revealed itself tonight and was at once subtle and complex. A very good game lies within this box and I am eager to play again.

A really interesting game, where the players drive the economy of the tiles by setting their own prices.  I think other games have probably done this mechanic, but I really enjoy how well this one works.  I'm really happy with my purchase here.  The primary downside is that with all the different player boards it does take some time to see which tiles are valuable for others, and the longer playing time might keep it from the table.

Think of Acquire where each player has their own board, trying to build hotel chains.  I found it more frustrating then fun at times as we fought over tiles that would help two of us.  There are some clever parts, such as setting a cost that you are willing to pay but that might be too high for others.  It seemed at times it was too clever, though, as there was a lot of changing of the game state through random events that seemed to come up quite frequently.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's a pretty cool game: you have to set the price just right, and buy the tiles you need in order to maximize the benefit from every worker. But it takes so LOOOOOOOONG! Our first play (3 newbies) took 166 minutes! We were all hoping to draw those last few event tiles! Also, it seems luck may have too much of an effect? If the early draws end up clustering around one player's starting setup, that player will be able to take best advantage of workers and therefore not only collect more field tiles, but also gather more resources. The game demands that other players balance the luck of the draw by appropriately pricing the items they sell, but that seems to be somewhat of a guessing game (at least early on). 

Of course, this is all just based on one play: it's possible that the game plays more quickly (especially with only 2 players), that there are other ways to minimize luck (e.g., don't put items in your store!), and that the luck of the draw becomes less important over the course of the game (if most of the field tiles end up coming out anyway). Still, it's a pretty dry game, and a bit fiddly (difficult to flip the hexes over without disturbing the rest of the tiles), and it started to feel repetitive near the end.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a good game.  Lots of strategizing and brain involvement.  A little difficult to teach and you really have to go through a whole game to really get a sense of strategy.  Then play it more to get good at it.  This may be tough to bring out on a regular basis as it is heavy and can move slow.  I really liked it though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I enjoyed the first half of the game, then realized that if you can't acquire certain tiles that are key to your plans due to the tile being removed from the game or purchased by an opponent, then you are out of luck.  There's usually nothing you can do once that happens, which is quite frustrating.  Overall, the game feels claustrophobic and lacks the fun factor making you want to play again.  Many good ideas that just don't quite work for me.  Also, why should a second field be worth double the first?

Something is seriously wrong with this game. It may be group think, but with each different group I played this, the game went spiralling into hyperinflation. Nobody could ever buy the tiles they put on offer, because it would have been snatched away already. So why offer a tile you really want at all? With no cubes flowing out and only flowing in because of labourers, you can guess what happens.

Group think or not, any game that repeatedly lets the players unwillingly derail the game could use some serious additional development before seeing a release.

RATING: 7
Euro extortion-bingo. Players attempt to purchase hexagonal field tiles from a shared pool. Tiles are labelled with coordinates from A1-G8 and must be placed on the corresponding space on that player's board.

These are hotly contested because of the two main sources of scoring: large areas of contiguous tiles, and the placement of worker tiles, different types of which must be placed adjacent to 1-5 field tiles. The trick is that workers provide special one-off bonuses when placed, but if a worker has a field tile placed on top then it can be moved and reactivated. 

Tile purchase is done using a Container-like system of offering 1-2 for sale. If you've got what another player wants, set the price to an appropriately extortionate level; if you want them yourself, set the price so the other players can't or won't pay.

Some comments here are unreasonably critical of the event tiles, which do add unnecessary chaos but generally have only minor impact.

My criticisms are mostly mechanical. It is quite painful to try and track other players' tiles, which makes planning difficult, and the worker and event tiles are misleading -- the text [i]seems[/i] clear but without the rulebook's clarification you are certain to get them wrong. The screens are unnecessary as hidden information makes the game significantly worse.

All up, an interesting game from the "extortionate economics" school, and one that I would be happy to play more often.

Single 4-player game, all newbies. Superficially luck plays a big part in this game, with the order of fields appearing in the registry. Over the course of the game I suspect this all evens out, and it's certainly a game that rewards planning and judging what other players would like to do and how much they'd be prepared to pay to do it. Being limited to 2 actions per turn makes for difficult choices most turns. The need to keep tabs on other player's boards make this a game best suited for a relatively small table. Keen to play again soon.

[One play] Unsure what to think.  Concept is interesting, with trying to get fields from a limited set that you need to put up for sale.  But very fiddly, with each tile going in only one specific place.  And it is hard to figure out how to actually benefit yourself; putting tiles up for sale tends to get them bought by someone else, and its unclear how to actually get the tiles you want.  Needs more plays to figure out the strategy.

Enjoyable but strange game where you build areas of a personal board from a set of shared unique resource hexes.  The trick is that you can't immediately place the hexes you claim.  They need to be put up for auction in your store, where every other player gets a shot at purchasing them before it gets back to you.  The "game" seems to be in correctly valuing these hexes so that they end up where you want them.  I've only played with 2 so far which was good.  I thinking keeping track of the board state for 1-2 more players would be pretty difficult so it might not be as good with 3-4 players.

I went into this expecting a very old, barebones, generic worker placement game, but was surprised to find a very unique experience with some good table banter. I really enjoy the gameplay, the bidding system and the puzzly nature of trying to work out how to expand your fields but also beat opponents to the tiles you want and try and maximize the use of workers. Also trying to set up locations for the harder to place workers is particularly fun. Very unique, and like other Key games, euro with a good amount of player interaction.

Despite the "4" rating, I actually like an awful lot of what's going on in Key Harvest. However, the fiddly requirement that you keep track not only of your board but everyone else's, as well, along with the random nature of the events (which can unravel many turns of planning in an instant) really left a sour taste in the mouth. This is a unique game design that is interesting but ultimately falls short.

Solid 8 game for me and I really can't see it going up from here.  Maybe even be starting it a little high...might slide to 7.  I like the game a lot.  I love the work for the tiles...we only played a 3 player so I'm sure that contention for the tiles is even more intense with 4 players. Role selection process with the workers it pretty cool too. Going to take a few more games to figure out whats the best price for tiles and such, seems like I was over pricing the ones I really wanted...not sure yet. 

UPDATE: I've since played this both 2 and 4 players and the game really stands up nicely. As I have my Thumbs UP/DOWN for 2 player games I'm going to post some thoughts specifically on 2 player here.

I like the game as 2 player but see a couple problems (for me anyway) with the base rules as 2 player. 1. the race for the townsfolk is non-existent as with 3 4's and 3 5's it's easy to balance out what your opponent has done. Possible fix that I'll try and report back on: Randomly discard one of each at the start of the game. Hopefully this will make the race for these tiles more tense as it is in the 4 player game..whew! 

If you count the number of goods left of a color, add your own stock then subtract from the total goods in the game then you know how many your opponent has of a specific color. Possible fix that I'll try and report back on: put all the goods in a separate bag when you need a "Yellow" you stick your hand in and grab a handful and take what you need then put remainder back in bag. This keeps the supply hidden and while you know the total number and CAN try and remember it would more accurately simulate the 3 and 4 player game this way.

Key series game about getting enough resources to be able to hold the tiles you want on your board and buy up other player's tiles from theirs. Fun enough, but I'm not sure you have all that much control over what tiles you get (and it can also bog down while you check all the other player's boards to see what tiles are out, which is usually the sign of amateurish game design).

Excellent game of the "Key" series. It is very well designed and only after you play it a second time you will realize how good this game is. It has some very innovative mechanisms that are interconnected. Components are top quality. My only complain is that you need the help of the other players to keep track which tiles are still available and which tiles are in demand by the other players. With the right group of players this game rocks!

RATING: 6
Key Harvest is really the sad child in the Key-series from Breese. It is not as highly acclaimed or lauded compared to Key Flower, Key Market or even Keythedral.... perhaps rightful so. First, the game likely doesn't scale well. With two, the auction or bidding mechanism feels a bit wonky. Players scoop up tiles from the registry and set the price (with different crop currencies) for others to bid in the next cycle. If everyone passes, you have the ability to pick up those tiles and place on your fields. Crops serve as currency for bidding and there are 5 types of crops. With two, this auction sort of fails to capture any tension because you know what type of crops you have and what your opponents have. There is no need for a screen at all. This kills and tension you may feel from hidden information. Moreover, the calculation is relatively straightforward. Your opponent wants the tile. How much are you willing to make them pay? Too much and you are stuck with the tile in your store. Too little and it makes the auction worthless. This auction mechanism may work well with 3 or more players. Still, it is certainly worth debating whether this is a game where the screens should be eliminated as it is all hidden trackable information. I also don't like the disconnect with the theme. Crops serve as currency and no other purpose. Hence, the idea of harvesting crops only to use them as cash feels disconnected thematically with the farming and harvesting of fields. 

Things I do like: I love the tile laying aspect of the game and also the event tiles. They introduce a certain amount of randomness in the game, but it is sort of nail-biting to wait for an event tile to pop up. It either accelerates or slows the game down as it acts as an in-game timer. I also do like the farmhands and the worker tiles even though I am not quite sure about the powers conferred by these tiles. I just like the act of adding tiles to my own tableau to increase or enhance my position.

The game also likely suffers from a rich-get-richer syndrome. If you get good tile placements which allows adding more worker tiles, you can really develop your board much more efficiently. This perhaps is less likely an issue with a higher player count?

Overall, a hit or miss and more of the latter at a 2-player count.

Almost purely abstract and very mechanical. Also hard to see playing situation and there is useless randomness. Still this game works well, but there is just almost zero fun to me.

RATING: 6
On a first play, I found the game quite engaging. We played with three people, which meant that we had room for some relatively uncontested development. On the other hand, we found that frequent confrontational play seems not to pay off, because the "victim" of this behavior was finally one of the two winners. The four different scoring methods are easy enough, and it's worth paying attention to all of them.

One complaint with the game is the art. My friends complained about the too busy art on the players' boards, which made finding building spots unnecessarily hard. Even worse are the busy colors on the worker tiles, which makes them hard to distinguish from field tiles; they could have been plain blue or round or better both. The rulebook is quite long, but is very throrough with its explanations.

All in all, I subtracted one point for our visual difficulties and a severe case of AP with one of the players.

It is extremely rare that I will buy a game on a whim without first doing extensive research, but I'm very glad I did just that with Key Harvest, as I would have never considered it based on the negative feedback it's gotten here on BGG. Although I can see where the naysayers are coming from, this is right up my alley.

Perhaps it is my affinity for economic games with a spatial element. What impresses me is that the market system actually works- you don't always want to buy from yourself but you also don't always want to buy from others. 

The events seem like they'd be game-breaking but in reality aren't- note you are virtually never forced to lose tiles from connected fields! Unlike Keythedral where the law cards really were too disruptive for my taste. 

With repeat plays I can confirm- this is a real solid and unique game. I will never turn this down and in fact find myself wanting to play it often. While there is some randomness, the spatial element of this game is just delicious and the supporting cast of mechanics (the market, worker abilities, events) are all very very enjoyable.

This is an under-appreciated gem. I suppose that is because it seems sort of uninteresting and random at a passing glance. It's hard to see the big picture until you play through a game. To put it into a modern gaming frame of reference, it's sort of like a game of Chinatown, but instead of open negotiations you have an Isle of Skye style market, where you have to set an asking price for a tile and if someone gives it to you, they take the tile and if they don't, you can take it for your asking price.

That's be fun enough, but layered in are some action tiles that let you break the rules of the game or take bonus actions and better still, there are ways to chain them together. What you end up with is a very tense game of valuation, with some exciting super combo turns that can change the game entirely.

If you already own all of those other games I talked about, there might not be any reason to seek this out. If you don't, or if you run across this for its usual asking price of under 20 bucks, it might just be worth picking up for you.

Auctioning tiles for placement on personal farm boards to expand contiguous farm patterns. As all Key-series games, resources are kept behind screens to set values for available tiles.   The crux is to set price low for tiles you need by hopefully using a limited resource type to others and setting high price to gouge or deny valuable tiles needed by others.

Purchased Essen 2007. I like the unique buying/selling mechanic where players set the prices of tiles. Do you sell tiles you want, or ones other players want? Do you set your prices low and gamble on the tile still being available when it's your turn again, or go for a higher price to ensure you get the tile you need? Interesting decisions to be made. 

The scoring system is clever, forcing you to build up (at least) two fields which increases competition for tiles. The event tiles are fun and don't seem to unbalance the game, just add a few twists along the way.

A small concern about the rich getting richer needs testing with further play. It shouldn't be too much of a problem if new players are aware that horseshoe-shaped fields and reusing workers are both powerful.

This game has a more constrained decision space than it seems to from a glance. The pricing of the tiles provides a nice push and pull to the game but the process of deciding which tiles to go for is a given most of the time.

One of the worst written rules in memory.  Like Brass, I would not recommend trying Key Harvest for the first time without someone teaching it to you, unless you enjoy being interrupted every so often to debate how to interpret certain information not clearly stated in the booklet.

With that said, the game actually offers a couple of interesting concepts.  While it makes sense to construct one large field so you can continually harvesting and replanting (by flipping the tiles over) for maximum efficiency, you are actually awarded more points for having a 2nd, albeit smaller, plot.  This process is further complicated by the use of workers, with abilities that ranges from the helpful to the baffling (like removing lands from your own board), which are worth VP at the end if they remain on the field.  So the strategy becomes how to best build your garden(s) around the workers in order to replace them with higher valued people, as well as to be able to resuse some of the pieces without the need to take an extra action of removing them.

The clever use of the auctioning system for tiles by setting a bid from your own source of goods also merits mentioning.  However, I do see a big discrepency between the value of the two.  A field tile is worth at least one point if it is part of the largest plot, or two if second largest.  It also allows you to put more workers on to the board.  Goods, on the other hand, are only worth a single point if you end up with the most in any given type, otherwise they are completely useless in terms of scoring.

Although Key Harvest isn't a bad game, it did dragged towards the end.  The replacment of land registry and the resolution of event tiles become awfully repetitive.  All in all it was a satisfactory but rather underwhelming experience.

RATING: 4
Take a lot of strategic elements, marry them with an interesting market system and art, and destroy it with random event pulls (that can make the game end much more quickly than you want it to) and loads of downtime.  Key Harvest just doesn't seem to know exactly what it is, and that's a shame, because there could have been quite a good game here.

This is the 2nd game we play in the Key Series, that exists of 7 games at the moment of writing. 1st experience with this series was Keythedral, and that was a good experience. Result is that we were curious to this game. Nevertheless, it took almost a year after we added it to our collection, before it ended up on the table. Started to read the rules, and I was struggling just like I did with the rules of Keythedral. I guess it has something to do with the translation, because on forum people mention the easy to read and understand rules. Watched a video about the game, and then it became very clear. And indeed, when looking back into the rules, if one of us had a question, the rules made it clear very quick. There are some nasty elements in this game, which I like. Those elements make this game different from other harvest games. It has to be said, that the rule of keeping everything a player has harvested in a two player game is completely useless. There are a total of 12 pieces of every crop in the game. You distract the amount of an specific crop which is behind your player screen from 12, look into the stock, and distract that amount from the result, and you know what your opponents has behind the screen. In a 2 player game, keeping things secret, just slows down the game. I like that you have to consider, do I want to keep this field-tile for myself (and put an amount of crops next to it, so it isn’t able for the other player to buy it), or do I want the other player to buy it from me, so I have more crops coming in then when I harvest myself. Also the rule, that gives you 2 points per tile for the 2nd largest field, makes it that you want your fields to grow in balance. It’s more interesting to have a 6 tile and a 5 tile field (which give you 16 points) then to have a 9 tile and a 2 tile field (which will give you 13 points). Where Keythedral is a game that could be played with a family, this one is a bit too deep for them. This is a very nice game for the players who will play on a regular base. A very good addition to our collection.

[I]tl;dr - It's Pit, you know what you're getting into when you come to the table. It's not going to set the world on fire, but it's still a fun game with some life in it. You [b]must[/b] check out [thing=56786][/thing] for a modern take on this classic.[/I]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

Pit is a classic card game that almost everyone has played. It's over a hundred years old, and while it's definitely got some wrinkles and blemishes, I think this game would hold up. I'm always on the hunt for games that play well at a high player count, so this will be a good addition for that occasion. 

I'm happy to have the same edition that I grew up playing, am looking forward to bringing this one to the table.

Look at your hand, pick those you do not want. Shout at the top of your voices for something else you want, and collect the set.

For the quite version, no speech, just gestures, better....

A crazy game which you are trying to trade your cards so that your hand only contain commodity of only 1 kind.  Something like heart attack which players exchange their cards but definitely in a messy and rowdy way.

Good points: A crazy game.  A definite hit if you have a group of fun loving and rowdy friends.

Bad points: Sore throat after playing the game from shouting too much.  After some time, the noise volume will just get lower and lower.

THE core game of commodities trading and cornering markets.  Master this, and the transferable skills will serve you well in so many other games (see my commentary for AH's "Civilization").

The problem with Pit is that it is too reliant on all players having the same strategy. It's frenetic, and that's fun. And for a game so old it's remarkable that it remains as playable as it does. But I can get the same fun from any number of other speed games.

RATING: 2.5
I do not enjoy this game AT ALL! I have played it a number of times because a friend always brings it on cabin trips but I know I am not the only one who doesn't like it, which helps. 

My friends version does not have the bell to signal the start and end of the game so as soon as you get your cards people are shouting to trade.

I like to get my cards in order first (it's an OCD thing) and [i]then[/i] start trading - i.e. when the bell is rung and everyone is ready. I find it stressful.

It's also [i]really[/i] loud and I don't find it relaxing. Of course I like board games where people get excited and it gets loud at times, but not when it's the core mechanic  of the game. 

Definitely not for me, sorry, but at least it's over quite quickly if we do play it.

I would rate this higher, as I always have a great time playing it, but it's hard to find a place where eight people can make as much noise as invariably happens when playing this game (it's virtually impossible to enjoy another game (or just about anything) while a game of Pit is being played within 50 feet).

We always played a variant with spoons/beanbags/etc instead of the bell.  The person to not get a spoon lost 20 points.  Lots of fun times when everyone else would sit there as the game got quieter and quieter until the last person or two finally realized they were the only one still shouting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Actually pretty fun.  Loud, obnoxious, but pretty fun.  A good player actually can win a lot by being flexible and observant as to what people are trading and what you'd traded to other people.  It's a lot of fun!

However, it really works best with a certain crowd, it's definitely not for everyone!

Billionaire Version. Great fun with a big group. Be warned the game can get VERY loud.

A very raucus game.  Plan to keep neighbors awake and have a good time.  Game play is basically set collection accomplished through trading.  Deals are fast and furious and always suspect to underhanded dealer-makers.  Not for the timid, but not vicious either.  This is one game that the louder it gets, the more likely everyone is having fun.  [GTI Code: TGCL]

It's been a while since I've gotten a good yelling, teeth-gnashing game of pit in. I'd like to get one in soon. Pit is one of those "gaming" experiences that makes you play the meta-game more than the actual game.

This was our favorite New Years Eve game as kids.  My family is naturally loud, and when the trading would begin, we would progressively get louder and louder, trying to be heard over everyone else.  It was absolute chaos, but a big adrenaline rush until somebody would ring the bell with a full set!  Unfortunately, we can't find many other people that like to play it as loud and chaotic as we do, and with the family spread across the country it doesn't get played much anymore.

The box is amazingly sturdy after all these years.  There is some wear on the edges, but it is minimal for a game of this age.  All the cards are present and accounted for, although one wheat card has a 3/8" tear on the side.  This edition also features the bear and the bull card along with the matching rule page for them, as well as the original rule set.  If nothing else, a nice piece of Americana.

Classic Pit Tin by Winning Moves, very nice. Tons of fun, family likes it, great party game.  So what it's not full of strategy and decision making.  I play games to have fun, and I have lots of fun with this one.  Have the 70's orange bell version as well for our camper.

RATING: 6.5
Really fun game for non-gamers and a great filler game for a gamer night.  I have completed a design that expands on this game that makes it much more in depth and a lot more fun... by my estimation.  It is tentatively being called Daytrader.  I will have a BGG page made up for it soon with all rules and some files to make your own version.

Would like to get this going with a good size group. Looks like idiotic fun. Don't really like the lack of graphic differentiation between the cards in the practically unused 1947 edition that I was able to pick up for $.99, Maybe I'll find another one soon.

Found an ancient disused copy in my a cabinet at my parents' house on a visit to see them, asked if I could have it since they hadn't played in decades and had no interest in playing, brought it back home with me, had a few months before losing to theft, never got to play once.

RATING: 7
Shockingly basic, but shockingly fun. We use this game with non-gamers to get them involved in a loud, braying, stock floor scramble. We've even played with people that don't really know English that well (or at all) and they've had a blast. The key is to get into the urgency of the game and it becomes infectious. There are almost always good-natured grumbles after each winner rings the bell (two hands slapping for the bell at the same time is the absolute height of drama entertainment). The bull and bear cards add a little bit of flavor over the basics. Not at all complex, but a fun romp that is recommended with large groups. The larger the better.

I hesitate giving Pit such a high grade, as it's an incredibly simple game.

you need the right players and the right mood.  it's noisy, crazy, chaotic, and fun for about 15 minutes or so.  play it once a year, and it's great.  any more than that, and bleh.  the "bell" is totally unnecessary, but get it anyway, it adds to the mood :)  also, the older of an edition you can get, the better.  this is a game from the great depression, and it's fun to play with the old commodities that they were familiar with.

This is yet another one of those games that many people enjoy, and I can't figure out why. I think the wife loves the mayhem that insues with everyone screaming and laughing. I suppose having a good time together is what it's all about, but come on... trading Rye by screaming "Two!" "I got Two!" "HEY, I got two!" ... "Come on. Somebody Trade with me! Two Two Two!"  "Two?"

My second child also likes to play this game. He essentially only likes party games, so there are two people in my family that like this game so it sees much more table time that I would like.  :-)

I love this game. I played it a lot with a big group of friends back when I was in law school. The bell makes the game. Unfortunately, the game sounds very boring when explained, and so I've been unsuccessful getting others to try it.

UPDATE: Finally played it with a new group of five.  Nobody but I had ever played the game before. But it took only one game for everybody to grasp the mechanics. By the next game, people were shouting, throwing cards, and hurling themselves at the bell. Tremendously enjoyable.

A game which I hated the first time out, but which grew on me a bit with more play. Not somthing you can play for hours, but good for a shorter game. Play with the bull and the bear (which are a later addition to the game), since otherwise a malicious player can sit one of each commodity and block the game (why would one do this, you ask? Well, it's always tempting to try to break a game you dislike too much, and Pit certainly draws a range of opinions). I like Reiner Knizia's recent Wheedle much better, but Pit has an elegance and uniqueness which is appealing, and it's a popular game that is also good.

How can this game be more than 100 years old?! It's unlike anything else I've ever played, but I like it! It's so much chaotic fun when players are screaming "2,2,2", "1,1,1" and "3,3, no wait, 2,2,2,2! Pretty random who ends up winning but that's how it should be. The bear and bull cards are cool too if you want to play the "advanced" game, but vanilla Pit is pretty good on its own! The only downside is that it's only funny with 5+ and you need to buy several copies as the cards will be torn over time...

Initial rating of a 9 after one play with 7 people. I'm not sure if this rating will stay this high, but this was an absolute blast. The game is incredibly simple, you can teach it in two minutes, and it engages everyone. Even mild-mannered people can easily get sucked into the frantic trading.

Only drawback I can see is that you probably need 5+ people, but as long as you have that number, I can't think of a better icebreaker for nongamers.

Upon reflection: This game is a "9" with total non-gamers, a "7" or "6" as a light option for gamers.

A loud chaotic game for family get-togethers.  Kids of any age can play along with adults.  We always combined this game with Spoons.  We would put a pile of spoons in the middle of the table - one less than the number of players.  As soon as one player completes their hand, they quietly take a spoon.  At this point, everyone who notices scrambles to grab a spoon too.  We never kept score - whoever didn't get a spoon lost.

How to rate this game?  It's in its own category -- a very silly game, which, when played in the right spirit (liberal cheating, outrageousness, drinking) has yielded countless hours of hilarity at family get-togethers.  But it's not really anything as a game -- just really lame.  So, on the one hand, it's worth about a 1.  But since it's been such a favorite for so many years, it has to rate higher!

Pit is fairly enjoyable but it is never a game I would suggest to play. It is one of those sleeper games that you forget about how much fun it can be until you play it again.

A real time card collecting game.  Everyone is trying to trade their cards to get a set at the same time!    This is a very fun and loud game....fun for a while that is.  I find that by the time someone has reached 500 points I'm a little bored.
Oh yeah, I recommend playing with at least four players, preferably more.

The perfect game to break out while the beards-and-bellies set is busy chin-stroking over at the El Grande table.  Obnoxious, frantic, loud, and completely chaotic all at once, which makes for a fun, funny, and social game.  There's some interesting strategy if you have time to catch it, particularly in picking what to trade and who to trade with.  If you don't, it's OK, just yell "One! One! One!" a lot.  Classic game, no doubt.

I remember the first time I played this. I was young, and it frankly looked boring. Trading wheat? Who cares? Where are the orcs and dwarves?

Then we started to play… Shouting and hollering and laughing as we traded cards back and forth, cursing anyone who slipped us the ‘Bear’’ card. It was great.

There’s a reason the game has been around for a hundred years.

Whoa, a blast from the past!  I think the bell was the best part of this game.  Sis and I incorporated it into many other adventures and experiments back in the '80's.  I think this game is still hiding somewhere in Mom's closet, or at least the bell is.  The cards are probably long gone.

When I just want to have fun, Pit fits the bill.  I usually don't try to win so much as mess with other people.  I hold on to one of each card type, and watch the other players scramble for the final card they need.  I hope my family doesn't read this and discover my true game is watching them get increasingly animated as they scramble to complete their hand.  This is a fun filler game.  (At least for me.)  My dad (age 60 ) especially enjoys this game.

RATING: 7
Awesome party game. It’s a raucous trading game that never fails to energize the group of players. The trading becomes intense as time progresses. Getting caught with the wrong cards is costly. Everyone feels that they are close to winning. There's always a lot of follow on talk about each round as players try to figure out where their desired cards were.

Components: Functional cards in the newer versions, but with the action these cards see, and their proclivity for getting played on camping trips, a new type of super-durable card needs to be developed.

Experience: Trading at its most basic and most exciting. No other one-mechanism game has been such a hit with me. This really captures that feeling of the stock pit as portrayed in Trading Places. The downsides are that it requires a lot of energy to play, and there is no carry-over from round to round; they all feel alike.

This and the game of Careers are the two games I remember the most fondly from my youth. Pit is a chaotic trading game that crosses rummy and go fish except everyone plays at once. You try to collect a set of cards and you take groups of cards that you do not want and start trying to trade them with someone else. This ends up with everyone holding sets of cards out in the middle of the table yelling how many they have, trying to get someone else with a like amount to trade with you. When you have a full set you yell 'PIT' and scoring ensues. To further add to the confusion we had a big German shepard named Tip who would go nuts whenever this game was played. Highly recommended for family fun (but maybe not for the serious gamer).

Part game, part scream fest.  Players play in &quot;real time&quot;, calling out a number of identical shares to trade with other players.  The object is to corner the market in one share type (ie. acquire all of them).  As the trades are blind, the skill is non-existant.  Wheedle is better.

6 - OK - Will play if in the mood

This game predates both world wars, yet in all its silliness, it's still an entertaining party game.  Is this something today's gamers want to sit down and think through?  No.  No, nothing like that.  But get enough people together who agree that shouting numbers while basically being a rowdy bunch for a couple of minutes is a good time and you can find some fun here.  Not much else needs to be said here.  It's nice and cheap and fun with the right group.  Game snobs do not need to look this way.

Its fun for a game or two every now and then but then I am ready to move onto something more.  Also towards the end when everyone is shouting "One!?!?" at once I just crack up due to the shouts reminding me of the pelicans in Finding Nemo.

Can't say enough about this game.  Rip-roaring fun, extremely loud and rambunctious.  A great game to just let it out and everyone ends up laughing hysterically at this end of this game, which normally takes about 1-2 minutes.  Don't play this game if you're not in a place you can make some real noise, but man is it ever fun.

This is a VERY loud game.  A lot of fun.  It is easy for anyone to learn in five minutes.  It would make an excellent icebreaker for a small party.  Nobody is ever left waiting to take their turn because it is everybody's turn all the time.  My only complaint is that the Winning Moves version, which comes in a nice box, does not include a plastic tray and the "suits" are a little hard to distinguish because they are not color-coded.  Also, this is not the type of game that you are going to play several times a week.  It's one to save for small parties or groups that include kids.

[-]I don't care for real time games, so the rating explains itself. If you haven't played it you do owe it to yourself to try it at least once. Deluxe edition with bell.[/-]

Revisiting Pit shows me that it really is a game of beauty. Look back at games you've played that were made before 1910 and see what you have, sure there are some obvious classics, but playing an intriguing, 100 year old set collector is a great experience! Make sure you have the bell.

RATING: 9
[3 plays] Huge fun in its own unique way.  (Come to think of it, this is the only stock-market-based game I can think of that is actually fun.)  Pit has that addictive quality that comes from every round making you think "I was so close!  Next time..."  Although Pit is over 100 years old, I just discovered it recently and can't get enough.  IMO, the coolest equipment is the older version of the deck where all the commodities are different grains, and the bell.  The bell is essential--if you don't have the deluxe edition that comes with a bell, just pick one up at any office supply store.

(After [b]2[/b] plays) This game takes perhaps the most banal of set-collection mechanics and turns it into a genuinely fun and chaotic real-time trading game. Surprisingly amusing, and its fast-paced nature means the game will end before you get tired of its repetitiveness.

The classic noisy & fun trading game on which Billionaire (Australian edition) was based.  Generally best with larger groups of 7-8, not serious but fast and fun party type game.

For a similar game, but with a bit more going on, less chaos but equally frantic, see Knizia's [gameid=5393]

Great, quick, accessible, portable ice-breaker, taking 30 seconds to teach (though it takes a couple of minutes to prep the deck and hands for the right number of players).  Great for non-gamers.

This is a LOUD GAME!
If you don't like loud, chaotic games, walk away now.
If you do, get this game.

I like this game better than the original (only because it allows up to 8 players.)

I made a version that can be played with up to 13 players.
You just need 3 identical decks of playing cards.
You need 9 cards of each suit.
Then just write bull and bear on 2 random cards (I'd use the Jokers).
When you get a set, just yell "Corner on the market!" (The bell isn't really needed)

Let me know if you do this :)

Nós somos negociadores de produtos. Iniciamos com nove mercadorias aleatórias em mãos e temos que trocá-las com os outros jogadores. Todos simultaneamente falam “troco 3”, “troco 5”, “troco 6”, em fim, você diz um quantidade e se alguém topar você entrega essas cartas que devem ser do mesmo tipo e recebe as que foram oferecidas. Quem juntar nove cartas do mesmo tipo bate a mão no centro e vence aquela rodada de trocas. Então a pontuação é registrada. Alguns tipos de cartas têm valores maiores que outras. No meio da história tem a carta de Bull que dobra a pontuação e outra de Bear que tira ponto. Isso prossegue até alguém alcançar 25 pontos. Algumas edições permitem ser jogado em 13 pessoas. Deve ficar um caos total. Curioso! Quando jogar em 13 pessoas, comento mais.

My favorite "party game". There are few things better than passing someone the bear in exchange for the card you need then ringing the bell for the win; although I find this to be in poor taste, unless that person is winning:). The later into the night you play this game the better it becomes. This game serves a wide range of players and groups. I've had my mom in tears from laughing and my friend up in arms from getting "beared" repeatedly. The Bell is a MUST! Minimum of 5 players needed in my opinion.

We play with the rule that you can trade any combination of goods at one time.

this game is so much insanity. you have to be quick on your feet to hear what people are getting rid of and be carefuly you aren't giving too much away about what you are looking for.

That being said, the 500 point goal needed to make sure everyone has a fair shot to win the game makes the game last longer than the fun (as we have never been interested in playing long enough to reach 500 points).

A loud, raucus fun game.  Though it is a card game, there is almost no luck involved, as your initial hand has nothing to do with your result.  The fastest trader, most flexible player, and the one with the keenest eye as to what is going on will win a disproportionate amount of time--I know, because whenever I&#039;ve introduced the game to a new group of people, I&#039;ve won the game 100% of the time, and in fact win well over 50% of the deals!  And for you novices, playing with the extra card is confusing at first, but as you get better you&#039;ll find that gives you a huge advantage--when I play with experienced groups, if there are 7 players, and 2 have the extra card, the extra card will win about 50% of the deals--so take advantage when it&#039;s your turn with the extra card.

I have the 1973 edition with the COOL orange bell!  We LOVE this game. The crazy chaotic trading is a hoot! We did get rid of the timer function though and house rules the market open. Here's what we do: The cards are dealt out face down. Each round the "market opener" role passes left. When that person says "go" everyone picks up their cards and begins to sort. The market opener gets to ring the bell and call "market open" when they choose. (usually as soon as they have sorted). This causes some crazy chaos as well as folks scramble to sort before the market is opened. This also give the young ones a chance to control the open time as well.

If you gave a game away as a gift, a game you wouldn't expect them to have, a game for everyone and anyone which game would you choose?  Pit has always been my answer to that question!  An instant family classic, I have yet to find a card game I prefer to play with family and friends as often as this one.  If you don't have a copy buy one tomorrow an go play.  Two suggestions though, buy the version with the bell and play with at lease six players.

As a *game*, Pit is pretty dire. But as an *activity*, it's a blast! And if there's a louder game, I haven't played it. Seriously, imagine 4-7 players screaming at the top of their lungs for a minute or so at a time. The notion of a player literally dying is a distinct possibility. Fun!

Gotta be in the right mood for this one. Easy to teach, but it really just turns into a yelling contest and struggle for power. And even if you have control there is a lot of chance. There is more fun with the bull and the bear, but it also makes the game take an insufferable amount of time. I like the "no talking" variant of this one. But either way, the scoring needs to be fixed or you can only play to like 200 points before you have to pull out the ibuprofen.

I rate this as a '7' if I am in the right company e.g. at a mixed-age, large, family Christmas gathering. In that kind of group it's really great. Doesn't have any great depth (being essentially a 'simultaneous happy families' game) but none the worse for that! I remember playing it as a kid when the commodities were very different (e.g. Hay, Flax). We didn't even know what Soya *was* back then (-;

A real-time, frantic game of trading.  It has all the excitement and noise of outdoor sports.  

The only downside is when you get a timid, or young player who doesn't get in and trade.  They often hold a few key cards.  

This is probably a gateway game to real-time games.

I was disappointed with how little thinking was involved. Beforehand I had assumed that you have to trade specific commodities with other players, but in fact, you only call out how many cards you have in your hand and swap blind. It is nothing more than organising your hand and exchanging your cards as quickly as possible. Still, the bell was very popular and I will keep it aside for rowdy and/or young gamers.

What a silly fun game, when I was learning the game I was very skeptic about this one but once the game begins you will scream and laugh a lot. It is one of the games game my family most enjoy playing (the other one is Time´s Up). I recommend this game for casual players and it is an excellent opener.

Lots and lots of fun. A must have for me.

It’s been years since I wrote the comment above and I have changed a lot during this time. I still have fond memories of the game and I would gladly play it (I own it) but I no longer can rate it as high as I did.

Pit is an ok party game but my desire to play ti has diminished a lot during the years. It still has a place in my game collection, at least for now.

This one's hit or miss for me.  Depending on the group, it can be boisterous fun or go over like a lead balloon.  Ideally, you'd like for a game to draw people out a bit, but the response to this one really seems to depend on the dynamics of the group.

This is a fun, fast game. Does it feel more like luck than strategy? -Yes.  Is there some strategy? -Yes.  Will it get a group of people yelling in excitement and awwing in disapointment when they don't corner their market? -Yes.  Fun game, it's cheap and I recommend it for those who want fast action "filler". I've upped my rating from 7 to 8, as the more I play (and with larger groups) the more I like it.

It's crazy to think this game is over 100 years old and it's great to see it can still hold up after all this time.  The game just sort of lost steam for us as we got in a position where we just seemed to lose ground for a bit.  Scores would fluctuate so big and often that if someone did gain, they would suddenly lose as we continued.  I'd like to give this another go with some more people.

A decent advanced variation of spoons. It's roudy and pleasing every so often, but it does require a large group. Usually save it for church or family parties where most of the people are unfamiliar with gaming concepts.

RATING: 7.5
Sometimes simple and stupid wins the day.  This is such a great game with the right crowd.  Strangely, in my case, the right crowd includes family.  These people do not usually qualify for the "right crowd", but get them in a game of Pit and you see a side of them you never saw.  It would probably rate more like a 5 with any of my normal gaming groups.

Our favorite party game for sure.  We play with spoons instead of points, so it really gets wild.

Probably the best pre-1993 party card games. Maybe still the best but I think the Resistance has started to edge it out.

RATING: N/A
In this loud, real-time trading game, players are given the task of cornering the market in one type of commodity. There are as many suits as there are players, and all the cards are dealt out at the start of each round. When the trading begins, players offer sets of cards to each other in the hopes of completing a set for themselves. If you're successful, you ring the (optional)bell and yell out, "Corner on wheat!" (or whatever your commodity is). You then score points depending on which it was - some are more valuable than others. Two cards labeled Bull and Bear may be used to add wild/penalty cards to the gameplay.

RATING: 7
Frantic & frenzy fun in the trading pit.  A classic in the party games category.  Best with large numbers so you can wake everyone else up... ;) This game turned 100-years-old in 2003 and has a quirky but clever mechanic devised for trading.

Nothing like a couple rounds of Pit to inject some life and excitement into an evening.  Loud and obnoxious, avoid the bear and be careful with the Bull...:-)  Oh yeah, beware of old decks where the bull and the bear can be marked...

Pit is the king of old schoool laugh out loud fun times while playing a board game. Games can get quite physical so make sure the surface you are playing on doesn't have any beverages or other breakable items as you can bet these will get knocked over within the first 10 minutes of playing this game. Pit is a stock chasing game where each player is looking to complete a set of 9 cards. Unfortunately for the player most of those cards will start out in other players hands. Fortunately for the player all you do is TRADE! TRADE! TRADE! During a trade the contents are a mystery but the total number of stock is known, so that is what you are trading with other players. 2 cards for 2 cards, 3 cards for 3 cards.
Its franetic and choas incarnate, and it is absolutely one of the best times playing a board game you will ever have. I can'te recommend this game enough, and I highly recommend you search out the 70s version with the orange bell of victory. It is cearly the superior bell to others.

Don't play often, but it's a good concept  VA

RATING: 7
I consider this an indispensible part of a game collection.  Classic, simple, pure, fun.  It always gets us laughing, and I love the sound of that bell being hit, followed by the inevitable "UGH!" from all the people who were one card away from winning.  So rare to get that from a game.

You wouldn't want to play it for more than 20 or 30 minutes, though, so it works best as an opener to an evening of games.  And I'm still trying to figure out a more fair way of incorporating the Bull and the Bear without giving a one-card advantage to two players each round.

RATING: 6.75
Fun, fast-paced family game.   This is the kind of game you will find in toy stores.  More main stream then most BGG games, but still fun to play once in a while.

A fun scream fest with a large group.

RATING: 7
Pit's magic formula? Speed plus Simplicity plus Intensity equals Fun. 
This is a real time simultaneous action game that will leave you panting. Lots of shouting, lots of cards changing hands at card-bending speed and rising tension until someone finally hits the bell (usually, just when you were about to get that one last card). 
The more players, the better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great, tense, shouting, fun.  I've never played with Bull and Bear, and never played with points.  Just play until someone collects a set, and then do another round until the someone wins a predetermined number of times.  Goes over shockingly well every time.

This game is always a blast with loud people.  Shy, quiet types can be put off by the necessity of quickly trading and making decisions among the chaos.  Requires quick rethinking when traders end up sharing the same unwanted cards.

RATING: 6.5
An early 20th Century Classic.  A great use of cards to reproduce the noise and apparent chaos of a stock exchange trading floor.  Happy to play in large groups for short periods (first to 250pts is my limit) but would never bring to the table out of choice.  Why because it is essentially a game of purchasing stuff and shouting.  Possibly a perfect game for a few of my ex-girlfriends but not really the interaction I am looking for.

This has been a hit with sooo many people.  it's a very energenic yelling game.  Personally I'd prefer to play something else, but I can't argue with the success rate of this game.  Lot's of fun at parties or family gatherings.  People love it !! 
Especially people who roll their eyes or power down during long rule explainations. 
It's extremely simple and probably the best bang for buck in my game arsenal.

RATING: 6
It has a bell. That's pretty cool. But it involves a lot of yelling too, which can get tedious.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A party game made before party games were cool. A loud game to get the evening off to a good start. Our gamers are always disappointed that only eight can play at a time...take a number, maybe you'll get into the next round!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's as good a game as the group playing IMO. You have to balance what you need with keeping what someone else needs away from them. Add to that the fast pace and it's a neat new experience. Really good party game and a kid in 2nd - 3rd grade can understand it enough to play. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's rare that I still love a game I played as a kid. It's not that I played objectively bad games when I was younger, but I've found better versions since exploring the world of board gaming. Pit is one of the exceptions. It's fast paced, involves being able to yell over other people, and has a bell. What more could you want?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

There isn't much going for this game other than nostalgia and the fact that it plays up to 8 people.

Bought Dec 2013. A very fun classic trading game. The simultaneous play gives it a very chaotic feel. Great!

I do love it, but I also have to be in the right mood as it is quite a boisterous game. This one has not aged at all, a true classic.

Great Party game.  Only suggestion is that you should play only the maximum amount of people.  The louder everyones personality the better. DO NOT play this game with introverts.

I hate Pit with a deep and abiding passion.  I strongly dislike pretty much all speed/reflex card games -- not so much that I'm slow but that they cause stress -- but I've never so much as won a single round of Pit.  Pit sucks, and it can burn in a fire.  A fire hot enough to melt that stupid bell.

RATING: 8
Another great game for larger groups (6-8 players).  We almost always end up laughing ourselves silly whenever two players inevitably try to ring the bell at the same time and end up slapping it off the table...  ^_^

RATING: 6
Fun party game to play with non-gamers
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Simple party game where you get 8 cards and try to trade them with other players until you get all 8 of the same commodity and corner the market.  If you play by the rules to 500 points, it become rather boring.  Usually we play until 1 player wins once or twice.  Fun if you keep the game to 30 minutes or so.

Rowdy trading game - best after a liberal amount of alcohol.

I remember playing this at about 1am in the lobby of an expensive hotel after a hard day on a residential training course.  

For some strange reason a regular guest complained about the noise and our trainer was woken up by the management to get us to go to bed.

Ten minutes later, he was shouting "four, four, four you &*%$ers" with the rest of us.

Incredibly simple and fun and noisy party trading game. Lots of shouting! Amazing how well it works, and it was published in 1903! Bull and bear variant doesn't add much.

Good for parties.  We always play this when we have a family reunion.  It's a good game, because even the younger kids can play it well.

Even though I don't like party games all the time, this is really a fantastic game when you've got 5-7 players. I raised my rating from 6 to 7.5

RATING: 6
Frantic fun that is good for quick filler sessions.  The biggest issue I have with this game is that only 1 person scores pts per round.  If you completed your set and just didn't ring the bell fast enough, you get nothing.  Still, if you are feeling drowsy, give this game a try.  You will be wide awake in no time.

Played 10+ times at social gatherings before logging plays.

Deluxe Pit is a nice package that includes a bell.  Pit is a light, but hectic, stock trading game.  In it players start with a handful of cards representing stocks in a variety of commodities.  Someone rings the bell and then players begin calling out trades they'd like to make.  What they are trying to do is get all the cards in their hand to be of the same commodity.  As soon as someone does that they ring the bell again, and they are said to have cornered the market in that commodity.  The catch is that all trades are blind, so no one knows what they are getting in return for what they give up.

Every commodity is worth a certain amount of points.  When a player corners the market, they get the number of points their commodity is worth.  Then the whole thing begins again.  This continues until someone reaches a predetermined number of points.  There is also a variant where a "bull" and "bear" card are included.  These cards manipulate the scoring.

Pit is a fast, fun, loud game.  Loud because players are all trying to call out their trades above everyone else who are trying to do the same thing.  For a raucous good time play Pit!

We didn't play by keeping score.  It might have been more fun if we did.  But I didn't ever corner the market so it wasn't that much fun for me.  I seemed to always be a few short.  We also only played with 4 players.  I think it would be more fun with more players.

One of my favorite party games, great to share with non-gamers. It's fun, easy to learn and the materials simple but very appropiate. I had to laminate my cards to avoid damage on them since the gameplay is very fast. Maybe the noisiest game ever, specially making noises of animals instead of yelling numbers.

A fun real time trading game with the right crowd.  I tend to prefer versions without the bell.  Using a bell it really hurts if someone slams your speedier hand on top of it.  I think this game could be considered a classic.  It has remained in print for a very long time.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Game in a Nutshell: Trade cards 'market style' to collect all of the same kind or commodity cards. Ring the bell if you have a set to win the round.

Played as: 5,6 player

Pros: Loud, exciting, fun. A game where there will plenty of laughter, groans, and smiles. Another extremely accessible game where the game moves fast and the rules only take a second to explain. Probably one of a few games where downtime is welcomed for recovery.

Cons: Yelling is pretty much guaranteed and I can't say that everyone I've played with looks like they appreciate it. Hardcore introverts aren't going to feel comfortable (++or it could force them out of their shells?). Luck does seem to play a part, so combined with the tone of play, the game takes chaotic to a new level... but perhaps that's the point. Can't say I always have the energy for it.

Other: For a self-proclaimed party-game disliker, I can take this. For something along the lines of an 'adrenaline' game (spoons being another example) this is by far and away the king.

Best Use: A rowdy, faster paced, party-style game.

Amazingly, I had never heard of this game up until this year. I've since bought this and the bell separately (cheaper than getting the deluxe version, and a better quality bell), and this has gone down a treat. I'm incredibly impressed, a game over a century old holding it's own against modern party games? Madness! If you haven't heard of Pit however, do yourself a favour and pick this up. Very cheap (approx $8-$15 depending on sales), and will be brought back to the table so many times you'll wear out the deck.

It's great fun with lots of players, but could be much better.  The cards are too hard to tell apart and look all the same.  For such a simple game, they did not pay any attention to playability.  But everybody still seems to have fun.  The bell really makes the game. 

Also, there aren't too many easy fun games that play 8 so it has that going for it.

RATING: 7
Elegant simplicity. A century old game that has simple rules, with seemingly easy mechanics... But there are a lot of social nuances that direct game play. I bring this one out when the "monopoly" players show up and aren't inclined to play Agricola.

Does anyone play to 500 points?  I think you'd have to be pretty hardcore.  We played to 250 and it went over pretty well!  Trading the bear around reminded me of those calamity cards in Civilization.  And the frantic screaming and the bell are pretty fun I have to say!  (played with 7 people).  Lost the bell and have to count up the cards...

Abstract card games tend to be some of my least favorite, but for some reason I can really get into Pit. For me, it's like a party game (which I generally rank higher)...full of loudness and chaos. Nothing like ringing the bell and saying "corner on rye". Throw in the old maid...I mean bear...and you have a winner. I give this game a rank of "6".

I love how fast and chaotic this card game is! Player scramble to try and complete a set of one commodity in this simulation of the stock market “Pit.” Rules are so simple and the game play is just like no other as players shout out and try to trade an equal number of cards to anybody that will trade with them. A definite crowd pleaser with most casual and hardcore gamers alike, if you don’t mind loud and chaotic games. Not very deep in strategy and more on the luck level but it's hard to resist it's fun charm.

I really enjoy this game, but it's very frustrating for the people who "don't get it" and never corner the market.  It's even worse when you try to play to 500 points.  Like Milles Bornes, better to just play a round or two to get everybody yelling.

RATING: 5
These old school games don't necessarily fit my definition of boardgame play in its current form, but I include this because this game is pure childhood nostalgia and created a love of dice rolling and card play and maps without the boon of electricity. 

It's a party game that lives well in the non-gamer social setting. Although I'd rather play many other games, this is one I will play rather than play nothing at all.

Frantic, fast, and quite overwhelming. If a round lasted more than a minute, it'd be most likely too much...

It's absolutely brilliant.

For a party game, this is a must. Very loud, however, right up my family's alley, and friends like it too. My original copy is so beat up, that some friends ended up buying me a second copy.

(After 3 Plays) 10/26/16: Pit can be some fun with the right group. There isn't much depth or strategy to this game which is ok because the play time is short. It often leads to some funny times with everyone shouting over each other but after a play or two, it overstays its welcome.

RATING: 6.5
Deck of cards with 7 different commodities (flax, hay, barley, wheat, etc)and 9 cards in each commodity. The deck also has a "bear" card and "bull" card. Players trade cards by shouting out a number, which is the number of cards they which to trade. Hand ends when someone gets all 9 of one commodity. Bull and Bear are worth negative points, while the winner earns points depending on the type of commodity. Fun trading game of trying to form sets, while trying not to pick up the bear or bull. In my mind, more of a party game. It's unique, different, and probably brings back fond childhood memories but not something that is likely to be requested often.

From what I can recall of my childhhod Pit experiences, this game is LOUD!  Lots of fun, sure, but loud as heck.  At least that's how I remember it.  I'm scared to try it out now because I live in an apartment and I'm afraid I'll disturb the neighbors.  One day, though, I won't be sharing walls with anybody and Pit night will be a "go!"

Update:  Yup, still as loud and chaotic as I remember.  Not a lot of strategy involved, but still a ton of fun.

A game of shouting and manipulating cards and your opponents as quickly and as loudly as possible. One of those great games where the theme is actually implicit in the mechanics more so than the components. The fact that it's still great after 100 years in print is excellent testimony.

Improved no end by the purchase of a cheap reception bell!

Want to yell at no one in particular for 45 solid minutes?? Want to be that annoyingly loud group at meetups that everyone else complains about? Pit's the game for you!

Even though I always end up in the negatives, this is the #1 Market Simulation game and always fun to play when your gaming group has lost steam.

Part of the delight is describing this game to newbies as a deep, thoughtful, strategy-laden game as I deal out the cards before the rules explanation. We play that the first person to win two rounds wins the game which gives us the right time length. A good opener and ice-breaker, getting everyone in a jolly mood.

Just a classic for me. Grew up playing this game and even before I discovered designer games this had such a different feel than the mass market games. Loved the craziness of trading, really feels like you are on the floor of the New York Stock exchange. Luck based I would say but always a blast even if you aren't winning. I will keep this game forever and have yet to see a party game replace it for me personally, even if mechanically there are better games.

*Never played for points yet, nor still not comfortable with using the bull and bear card. Instant fun everytime this is introduced, with people screaming "who had......"when the trading stops. There are tactical decisions in set collecting and tracking of who has what, which makes play interesting. I can never play more than 3 rounds as the vocal chords suffer. A rare game which can cater up to 8 players. I can't help thinking this is what it must be like on the stock exchange floors around the world.

RATING: 10
UPDATE: Upgraded rating from 8 to 10.

Deeper than you think (but not that deep). Subtle tactics, like holding onto cards longer than you should, deciding on how long to hold the Bull card, and not trading high valued cards to players in the lead. However, because the game moves way too fast, most "gamers" won't notice these subtleties and dismiss this game as a mindless and overly loud party game (which are two particularly good features of a party game).

AVOID THE NEW REPOS PRODUCTION VERSION! It does not come with the Bear and Bull cards, which are essential to this game. Stick to the American version with the hard-to-distinguish, monochrome cards. This adds an additional challenge to the game!

Gave this a six, because I do have to be in the right mood, or more correctly not in the wrong mood. Need a peaceful game? This isn't it. I first learned this in my youth group as a seven year old, and I've liked it ever since. It gets played every games night (the one for my kids, not the one I go to!), and I always bring it out at birthday parties when my children's friends are getting antsy, and everyone needs to blow off some energy. Excellent game for young people, as the skill you need most is a good yelling voice.

Secret Santa 2007-played this with 3 and then again with 4.  This was not very good with 3 but with 4 it was a much better game. Seems this game just gets better with more people.   Nice quick little filler which seems to bring some laughs too.  Still fun despite it not having a whole lot of strategy.  Having the bell surprisingly adds more fun to the game too.  The bull and bear cards really bring in a second layer to the game with a memory aspect.  5 plays even better than 4 and there were again laughs all around.  However ,playing to 500 is way too long for what it is.  250 points seems spot on for a 45-60 minute game.

Okay, I can quite enjoy Pit in which players shout numbers at each other in an attempt to make a complete set of one commodity by trading cards, but on balance it has always felt like a border-line board game, almost in the parlour game category and I just need to be in the right mood for anything like that.

I had a lot of fun with my family playing this game. It's a real-time game where you are trading cards with the other players while trying to collect an entire hand of cards that are a single commodity. Ringing the bell when you "CORNER THE MARKET" is so satisfying! It's crazy and entertaining, but not as stressful as other real-time games for me. It's not one that I'd like to get out very often, but an occasional re-visit would be more than welcomed.

Unleash the noise. If you can stand the noise level, it's a hit with the old and young alike. My husband combines it with Spoons.  Instead of yelling "corner the market," he has you silently take a spoon and see how long it takes others to notice.

Playing until 500 points is absurd with max players. Even the "short game" to 250 is crazy. We played just to 150 and it was a blast. Never shouting "1, 1, 1, 1" was so much fun and crazy and exhilarating at the same time. 

Maybe some day it will get old, but for now one of the easiest and craziest party games I have and love.

A party game where there are nine cards of 8 different commodities that get mixed up and dealt out to each player. Players try to assemble nine-of-a-kind by trading cards one, two, three or four at a time, face down to each other. Once players agree on a number of cards to trade, they exchange the cards to see what they got. It gets pretty loud as players scream, "Two! Two! Two!" and Four! Four! Four!" at each other just like the traders did back in the day at the Board of Trade. Lots of fun but very noisy at my house!

My game does not have the bell, but I see why this game comes with a bell.  The bell is not a gimmick, it's a tie breaking mechanism.

I really like the intense and frenzied trading in this game.  It helps that the game can technically be played with a standard deck of cards.  It also was originally about trading train stocks, which makes it a train game (yippee!!!).  It works really well for what it is.  Wheedle is a Knizia's slightly different take on this.

I bought a version from the 1960's from a garage sell because I remember playing this at my Uncle's house as a kid. I haven't gotten it played yet at home but it brings back fond memories of shouting at the top of my lungs and laughing with my cousins. Great classic game of yelling!

I really enjoy Pit but you have to certainly be in the mood. It is a loud, crazy game. Works best with at least 4 people and the bigger the crowd the more fun it can be.
If you want the game that is the equivalent of heavy metal music, Pit is its loud, fun, brainless representation.

2006: 8. Uproariously fun party game.  Don't play it with less than 5 people, you just won't get the same enjoyment out of it.  7-8 is best.  Favourite game to play up at the cottage or at family reunions, bumps up the energy and gets people to come out of their shells. You know you have a great game when people start talking about it immediately after a round is done.

2013 UPDATE: 7. Still a fun game, but I've played it too much now, and much of the allure has worn off.  I'd be up for a few hands, but only as a preview to something weightier.  It's still a hilarious game to teach to new people though.

Very exciting and yet very annoying. The sound of the bell is wonderful when I ring it, and frustrating when rung by an opponent. We tried playing a silent version once, but the risk of eye-gouging was too high.

New version doesn't have a bell, which is an improvement. Turns out that this game is great to play with kids, even as young as 6 or 7 years old. Plays best when you have at least five players.

This game is fun and LOUD, a perfect game to wake up your gaming group and your neighbours. This is probably the most active and frantic card game you'll ever meet. Players simulate a live commodity trading floor (called "the pit") and whoever gets a full set of commodities via trades first is the winner. Every group I've introduced this to has absolutely loved it. The more players the better.

For causing an immediate descent into chaos, the opening bell of "Pit" has few rivals.  The rules can be explained to even neophytes and children in less than a minute, and people with vastly different levels of gaming experience can play and enjoy it on essentially even levels.  If you like it at all you'll probably like it forever (there is no curve to master and no "true solution."  And the visual experience -- the gasps of frustration as people accidentally exchange identical cards, the bouncing and mad gesticulation as traders try to emphasize their offer over another's, the facial contortions as people run short of oxygen while repeatedly screaming "four, four, FOUR!!!" -- is a pearl beyond price.

Sure you might already have PIT but you will enjoy Gavitt's Stock Exchange a lot more. The way OTB has packaged the game looks 100% better then PIT which is just in a cardboard box, with a deck of cards and some photocopied looking rules. Gavitt's comes in a very funky looking tin, it includes the history of the game, updated rules and the original game box all neatly stacked inside.
The basics of both games are the same but there are variations in Gavitt's Stock Exchange that makes playability that much better. The choice of playing using the original 1903 rules or the updated ones also adds to the fun. Overall for game playability, presentation and price, Gavitt's Stock Exchange is my choice over an inferior looking PIT! A+++

When the ONLY fun thing about playing this "game" is slamming the bell, and the copy of the game being played on doesn't have a bell because it was broken on the first play of the game, what's the damn point?!?  I could see how people who enjoy yelling at other people and getting excited about things might enjoy this, and the theme of frantically working the stock-market floor comes through surprisingly well (I assume that's what the theme is supposed to be).  But holy pit, this is not the game for me.  Game design: 1.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 0.5/5  Total: 2/10

[Winning Moves 1998 Standard (non-colorful) Edition] {Party; trading, real-time; optimal 6-8p} A silly but extremely hilarious party game: cheerful and purely chaotic. It's a very nice party game and my friends like it very much. (I think it's better to own extra copies have because the cards are wearing fast). It's a very loud game. Don't play it at midnight; otherwise, your neighbor will get mad.

[New edition] The new color edition is very ugly for me. I wish they could publish the same original edition so that I can replace my damaged cards with the other copy.

[Broken game] Pit is vulnerable to be broken if a player determined to collect single card of each commodity.  However, I think it's only the mentality problem of a player. If I found out any of my friends doing so, I certainly will never invite him/her to play again.

Needs 5+ players and needs the right (competitive) crew.

If you have both it is a great (party) game! Really recommended to get everyone worked up after being burned out by an overlong Euro/Ameritrash game requiring all sorts of mental activity. Or just as a party as a quick time diversion. Can see this played at family gatherings.

Caution: don't play with slow-players or people that like getting one of each card and just watching everybody get frustrated for their inability to complete any set. Both situations have a simple solution though that limits the pain to one play only..

Anyway, really, really recommended.

Yes, *that* Edgar Cayce, but don't hold the kooky inventor against the game.  Simultaneous trading + set-collection, stripped to bare essence--makes for a rollicking "party game" from the early 20th cent.  With four+ players Pit hasn't disappointed yet, but esp. devilish with six.

Wow.  What a game.  I tried Pit more than a dozen years ago and it was quiet.  Morose.  People sat around a table and said "Two.  Two." as if they were in a library.  A complete flop, and I got rid of the game.  Fast forward to modern times, after reading here on BGG how amazingly fun and loud and raucous Pit is, I bought it again, with the bell, and brought it out in my group.  Loud.  Raucous.  Hilariously fun.  One time, a group hosting a loud party in a room next door came and asked us how it was possible that the people playing cards sounded like they were having way more fun than the people at the party.  In short, everyone needs Pit.

My wife and I got this game as a gift not knowing what it was.  Boy, what a surprise!  We now use it to close out the evening when we invite friends over to game.  It's loud, frantic, and just plain fun.  Everyone we've played with loves this game.  It's just full of funny moments like when you trade away your two wheats to get…another two wheats.  Or maybe you rush to ring the bell only find out one of your oranges is actually coffee.  "Game back on!  Don't give this guy any oranges!"  Be prepared to have your cards absolutely DESTROYED, though.  Don't worry; the game moves so fast you won't even notice.

Pit is a raucous and rowdy trading card game.  It seems like it would be almost completely random as players are blindly trading their cards with each other to try to create a set, but for some reason the same people seem to keep winning over and over, so perhaps there's more to it that I'm missing.  It's certainly fun, and perfect for a large group of 8 to 10 players, but if I have less than that, like only 5 people then I'd rather play something with a bit more decision-making like For Sale, No Thanks, or Coloretto.

A fun trading game - fast and furious trading, by the way, usually having a soundtrack of loud offerings.

[thing=140][/thing] is a really fine design put in so little moving parts: you basically just have a deck of cards, most of the cards being of different type of commodities, and also two special cards: the bull and the bear. The goal of the game is to complete a set of one of the commodities, and, to do this, you trade. But you can't announce what you want or what you are trading, you can just name a given amount of cards - you are saying that you want to trade, say, "two cards", this also means that you will receive the same amount (i.e.: two cards). 

And that is it. This is all the game.

Everyone saying (or, usually, shouting) the number of cards they want to trade. Then, by trading one, two, three, whatever number of cards, you try to complete a set, then you call "pit!" and the round ends. You will receive the amount of points equal to the number on the commoditie, like 65 points for a complete set of Oil. The Bear is a wild card, and the Bull is worth negative points for the player that ends the round with it.

It is a party game to the core - not really a whole lot of strategy, nor even tatics - you just try to trade as fast as possible, in the hopes of getting the cards you need. I don't found a particular way to play [thing=140][/thing] really well, but, usually, players that trade 1 card at a time, which is not usual, do a little better than players trying to trade 2 or 3 at a time. I guess there can be something in this.

Anyway, a good game, easy to teach, to play, and has lots and lots of interaction. Not a game to be played everywhere (it can, as I said, get loud), but if neighbours and/or other gaming tables aren't an issue, I'm usually up for a game.

Edit: It is still a fun game, but it can take way too long, if playing until 500 points. I lowered the rating in half a point (7.0 - 6.5) due to this.

I'm not usually a fan of quick "reaction" games. But this is fun game where you have to trade and yell out what commodity you want or are willing to give up. When you get 7 commodity's (I believe), you ring a bell in the middle of the table to signify you have "cornered the market".

Pit is king. Best party game, best for kids, raucous fun, and semi-educational.
We've played the silent version, the multi-lingual version (each player must choose a language for their number-shouting) and all other sorts of variants.
The Bull and Bear cards are essential, so avoid the  hideous Repos set on that basis if not for the poor choice of commodities.

RATING: 7
Chaotic card trading game that makes a fantastic (and highly portable) gateway game bordering on "party game" status. Fun for a few laughs when you want something light and extremely social. Plays well with a crowd - 6 to 8 is great (it would be even better if it could handle even more players).

This game is the very definition of a "6."  IF you're in the right mood, this is the ONLY game that makes sense.  However, as that mood hits me once every 20 months, most of the year I'm way to mellow to scream "CORN!" at the top of my lungs for 3 hours.  Try it during a night of heavy drinking to watch people really lose their minds, though, and you'll laugh like you've never laughed before.

Great game, it isnt nearly as fun with 3 players, you need 5. That is what really makes it fun! Very fun game. The most challenging part is trying to discribe it to people and sparking their interest to play, once you say "stock game" or things like that, that usually makes them run :)

This is a game that brings back many memories from my childhood so I hold this dear to my heart. The card game itself is not really in my top list of competitors but I do always enjoy playing it. It was the perfect family game we would play during a large group get together or even outdoor parties. That being said, what really makes this game fun is all the shouting as we are all racing to trade the perfect cards. My favorite moments are when you manage to trade the bear or the bull and you look up to see the face of the person as they realized they have just been screwed.

RATING: 7.5
Frenzied chaos of the sort that can seriously damage cards and make your neighbors irritated by the noise. At first I thought of giving this game a lower rating because it is so basic (and because my strategy of sitting quietly and listening to who needs what makes it less "fun", although I have a great time). But in the end, what makes a game great is whether or not it's enjoyable- and Pit certainly is! I am still confused as to the Bear/Bull difference and I am no good at card counting but I certainly love the element of trade and collection. It's quick, crazy, and awesome- all the elements of a winner of a game (even though I never won) for sure! Almost even a favorite.

Billionaire is identical game with a variation on the theme. loud, real-time trading game, players are given the task of cornering the market in one type of commodity. There are as many suits as there are players, and all the cards are dealt out at the start of each round. When the trading begins, players offer sets of cards to each other in the hopes of completing a set for themselves.

It’s so loud and great! Here’s the situation: you and several other people are sitting around a table with 9 cards in your hand. Someone says go, and suddenly everyone is shouting “1! 1! 1!” “3! 3! 3!” and shoving cards into other players’ faces. It’s absolute chaos, and that chaos makes this game hilariously great. The bull and bear cards make the game even funnier, because players will noticeably dismay when they get the bear, but someone will immediately trade with them anyways.

It's fun to have an excuse to shout at people, at least for a short while, and this game gives you perfect license to do so.  It's pretty fun in short spurts, but it can start to get old pretty fast.

Printed rules for playing with three standard decks. Probably it doesn't matter too much even if the backs are not similar in all of the decks. If someone is able to follow those while trading, good for him...

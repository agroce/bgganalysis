Been into the minis game for a while.  This is a perfect gateway.  Everything you need and with the "Read This First" manual you can be up and playing in 20 minutes (punching and unwrapping tokens takes time!)

This one did not live up to expectations. I was hoping it would be easy to pick up and quick to play, but I found the rules and mechanics to be a bit too fiddly. I love the theme, but it just wasn't enough.

RATING: N/A
By reading the rules, the game seems to be extremely well designed. 
The rules are the main hurdle to playing the game though. It is not a piece of cake to understand them on your own without someone teaching you the game.
None of my usual gaming partner is willing to delve into this hardwork.

I've only played Guild Ball twice, which has been enough to establish that it isn't to my tastes. My 2 plays of Guild Ball were extremely slow and quite boring, so much so I abandoned both games (a 3v3 after the first goal, and a 6v6 after a couple of hours with no points scored). I found it difficult to be precise in moving the miniatures, and when applying the templates: in a crowded area I couldn't avoid knocking the miniatures a little. The characters have too many special abilities to keep track of (a problem compounded by the difficulty of identifying the miniatures without careful inspection, as well as by the fact that half the characters' information is on the reverse of their cards).

I'm willing to believe the experienced players that Guild Ball becomes exciting and fast when the players have some experience,, but for me it's not interesting enough to persevere to reach that point. I suspect miniatures games are just not for me

As for the physical components in the Kick Off! set, I'm a lot more confident in my criticisms. The dials are quite loose. The ugly miniatures are difficult to identify on the board (particularly the three bearded guys in the Brewers). Having to flip the character cards over to check information is a bad design choice: there should be double sized (or just two per character) cards with all the information visible on one side. The cards are also a bit flimsy and lack rounded corners.

A  serious review of the
GERMAN EDITION 2017  ( Guild Ball: Anstoss! )  by  "Ulisses Spiele"
It is a VERY serious review,  almost Coen-Brothers-serious.
So brace yourself and read.
In silence.

1. Production value, quality of components & assembly:

+ Good minis & board, above average tokens, counters, dice...
+ "One piece" minis, no assembly needed. Nice & functional storage cardboard box for the minis
+ Overall really good printing quality, especially the board
- The plastic centerpieces needed for the assembly of the healthcounters are a bit on the fragile side - so be careful when you press them together..there are only two spare pieces...

2. Localization

+ Good translation of the original  season 3 rules
+ Player cards feature character traits in german as well as their original english titles. Good idea !
- I wish the above was also true for the tokens and some of the attributes ... why did "KICK" had to become "SCHF" ?
++ Praise the lord, the old gods AND the age of reason:  The character names HAVE NOT BEEN TRANSMORPHICATED INTO GERMAN - for this would have been a disaster..

3. Rules layout and structure

+ Well structured sequence of explanations for the games mechanics, easy to access (but hard to master) hands-on approach; the booklets come in just the right, handy size  for reading them on a morning subway ride...so nothing to complain here, with one exception:
- -The "snapshots" illustrating the player positions in the introduction scenario are way too small; i had to look them up in the internet...or is it just me.. "I'm just a poor old man. ... My legs are grey. My ears are gnarled. My eyes are old and bent."
...no, really. They are too small.

4. The game. The fun. The very subjective opinion..

It already has been said. Elsewhere, out there:
What a beauty ! 
Triggering the nerves of laid-back boardgamers and avid tabletop fanatics alike, Kick Off! is providing the proper gear for an immersion into the complex but wonderfully smooth amusement that is Guild Ball.
Even though none of its elements are genuinely new per se, the game does a great job reimagining the old fantasy-football theme in such a way that both the setting and the mechanics bring something fresh and new to the table.

Unlike "the other big fantasy-football game" which is still collecting some dust from 30 years of half-hearted design decisions and recycled art concepts, Guild Ball shines with aesthetic coherence. Some folks out there *might* label the games artwork as too consistant, too simplistic, not martial enough for its theme etc..while, at the same time, proclaiming that it's all a matter of taste. I beg to differ. From the color pallette to the player portraits; from the miniatures to the guild symbols: This unobstrusive elegance has a supportive function; its coherence is actually complementing the games rather precise set of rules. There are only a few games out there doing this right i.e. Scythe is one of them - Mutant Chronicles Warzone is not. Think about it:
If you play a game with a decent amount of abstract thinking involved - why would you want a rulebook with every second illustration looking like..like Hitler had a wet dream about SiliconeGirl and Optimus Prime taking the wrong drugs in front of the blackmetal stage at the local gym ?
...

 The mechanics are clearly geared towards rewarding strategical thinking and analysis more than pure luck. Nevertheless, they also support the spontaneous creation of these little dramatic peaks; these almost shakespearean moments where everything turns to shit: 
When your captain tries to beat the opposing teams stupid mascot into oblivion to finish the game  and - with a whopping dicepool of 12d6 - not scores a single hit, but recieves a counterattack that knocks him down...you want to scream, blame those damn dice for it, blame the designers, blame RNGsus.. only to realize, looking at the board five seconds later, that you could have scored a goal _easily_ with another player..if only you had allocated these two influence points differently at the beginning of the round..but then again, everything made sense during your last activation..so BLAME THE DICE...but wait....
Through these little "pockets of confusion", paired with a multitude of player synergies, resource management and timing, you realize that the set of rules is also tailored towards establishing a strong ingame narrative and preventing the game from spiraling down into the abyss of monotonous number crunching...

5. Final thoughts:

Come on. Really ?
Toying with little plastic figures ?
Be an adult ! Cut the crap ! 
Get a life !
Get a girl !
.
.
.
...then hook her up with Guild Ball !

Fantastic brutal football (Soccer) miniature skirmish game.

Looks to be the best starter box in miniature game history. Everything you need to play in one box with no assembly required.

May pick this up if price is right. Always wanted to try this game but not willing to deal with metal miniatures...

Skirmish miniature game with a football/soccer flavor in a fantasy world but WITHOUT orcs, elves, dwarves, dragons... Only cool human beings (and animals). 
Thank you.

"Blood Bowl" is expensive and unattractive (despite my love for the Warhammer World).
"SoccerCity" is indeed a beautiful game but attacking your rivals is waaaay more fun than playing a soccer simulation.
It may have been "Dread Ball" but the teams in Guild Ball felt more inviting. The mascots and the "taken out" players (instead of "killed" or "maimed" players) were a strong selling argument for this game.

A lot of rules to remember ("Watch it played" videos were extremely helpful) but nothing insurmountable with some practice (took me 2 game sessions) and player aids.

The "Kick Off !" starter set is a good starting point (and a big box of fun) at an affordable price.

An amazing all-in-one jumping off point for this game. It has everything you need at a compelling price. All the rules. All the strategy. All the violence. All the skill. All the fun.

Comprehensive for a 2-player starter.  I like the free-form tabletop style movement but this isn't going to replace Blood Bowl for me any time soon.

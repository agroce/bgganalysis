Thematic, strategic tile-layer with a strong market component.

There are several options each turn, many of which can be performed multiple times, and there are a myriad of things to consider and consequences for the actions.  Many actions also cannot be performed unless you have the coveted consumed polyp tiles (which you win by eating/attacking other coral reefs).  The game essentially requires you to fight against other corals, in order to advance yourself, and you also want to set up your own coral so that your parrotfish can consume it, and thus score points.  Of course, you will need to take turns to manipulate the coral hierarchy (market) in order to: a)make sure your corals are stronger than others, so they can attack and not be attacked, and b)to ensure that your corals score more points after they are consumed by your parrotfish.

The components are great, the rule book leaves a bit to be desired (but it's not as bad as it's made out to be), the theme is great and apparently very realistic, and the gameplay is very deep and strategic.  Seems to scale well for 2-4 players, and has a few different paths to victory.

At first I was turned off at the slowness and difficulty in accomplishing your goals, but I'm slowly realizing the subtleties you have to work with.

Update: Formerly an 8. In retrospect, some clunky rules and strange interactions mean that it doesn't feel worth the effort to get it to the table. Teaching this is no fun.

An interesting tile laying, area control game that is easier than it seems. I've only played two player so far. My first game was a leisurely one where neither of us tried to push the pace of the game. I imagine that if I had played to end the game quickly it would have been a different experience. This one has a lot of potential, so I'm curious to keep playing.

RATING: 8.5
Reef Encounter is hard to learn by yourself, because to understand why you'd want to take a given action, you need to understand the game as a whole.  So this one is tough to learn and teach, but after a few turns it should click.  Your first game should definitely be approached as a "learning game".  

Fortunately, locking in color dominance doesn't come until the latter half of the game and most players should have a grasp of what's going on before that time comes.  Speaking of dominance, there's this really cool mechanic for flipping a bunch of tiles rather than just the one you want, so each decision definitely has knock-on effects.  For the first few games you play, delving into that aspect of the game will be "too deep"; just don't worry about it.

There's room for interesting tactical plays here, especially in terms of cutting big coral clusters up and protecting yourself from attack.  It's very much war on the table, and you're constantly thinking about how to attack and defend.  It's a little like Tigris & Euphrates in how it feels, but it plays out much differently.

It's a fun and very engaging game.  A brain burner, but not super bad.  The rules aren't very complex, but they're hard to grasp.  It has the honor of being "surprising woman friendly".

RATING: 6
After a long clunky rules explanation, it was clear that this game is a complex affair. As I started to get to grips with the rules and basic mechanics, the board started to get crowded and then the aggressive gameplay came to the fore - this is a game of direct conflict, which is a genre I don't get on with at all. Game-end eventually came and the final scoring added a further level of complexity. This is a complex, abstract, aggressive game and as such, not my style of game at all. Looks attractive though.

I've only played this game a few times but it seems like one of the more deep and strategy rich games I've played in a while. Still working out my techniques but I've been loving every minute of it so far.

Update: Love this game. I've played it a few more times and  while I can totally follow and build strategy I still feel like I'm missing something and waiting on that "Ah ha!" light bulb moment. Even without it though it's still a very fun and satisfying game. And my wife loves it so that always helps.

From the Reviews: I think this would be a good game. Sounds like there will be lots of player interaction and strategy and planning ahead. These are things I like and with reduced AP, which is not a problem with our group, this could be really fun. The level of strategy appears to be very deep from what I have seen.

What a different and amazing theme!  I haven't really gotten the proper feel of the game yet.  It felt like a "take-that" while you are trying to score large areas, all the while the "stock" prices are fluctuating.  The elements are pretty neat, but really, it just made me want to play [b]T&E[/b].  I'd like to try it with less players, as 4 was pretty chaotic.

RATING: 6
+ Very cool theme and look to the game; Tons of difficult decisions on what to grab, when to grow, and especially when to eat.
- For as complex and lengthy the game is, there are plenty other games I think I'd prefer to play.


Why it's previously-owned:
For the length of time that it takes to play this game, I can play most other games twice. This is a good game, but the "goodness" vs. length ratio is not as good as most.  
I traded this away for Colossal Arena and Pergamon.

1st play: Breese strikes again. Wow! The deceptively peaceful, almost cute theme hides a beast of a game. So much to think about and plan through every decision matters and it's tight. The theme also ties in very well to the mechanics. This game left me mentally spent.

2nd play: Played with 4 this time, and the game is still great. I think it's slightly more interesting with 3 due to larger corals, but still excellent. We had more opportunities for nipping away at each other's corals, and the game ended via algae tiles instead of eating. I really liked this game.

RATING: 6.5
Reef Encounter is a game with a very strange theme, but not thematic at all, in fact it is very abstract. A complex game that overcomplicate things, but have interesting decisions, the expansion adds some stuff that add to complexity and variety, and is so much needed to keep this game replayable. In the end it takes too long for what it delivers.

RATING: 7
'The prawn game' has rather unfairly become the byword in my group for rule impenetrability.  It's actually not too tough a game, in terms of rule complexity, but there's no thematic redundancy to help you out - if you're hazy on a rule, there's no way you can lean on your background understanding of the way coral reefs work, say, to kickstart a reminder what to do.  Instead, you have to go and read the rule again.  As a result, the arbitrariness of the theme is continually flaunted in your face.  'The prawns are laughing at me', I thought, as I effed and blinded and reloaded the seventeen phases into my short term memory ('phase 0: load the seventeen phases into etc etc').

After my first game, I have to say that the game is heavier than I thought, but still was interresting. I like it, but I'm not sure I have the crowd to play it. Played it with 4 players, this might be just 1 too many, there was a bit too much chaos for my taste.

The 5th game self published by Richard Breese and the 1st to not have the Key theme. Probably his best so far. There is a lot to think about in this game since all aspects of the game are interconnected in subtle ways. Tougher to explain than it is to actually play but it does take a while to really figure out how everything fits together and what you have to do to win. Great game.

2-4(3)

UPDATE: A lot of quirky recordkeeping that can be easily forgotten: keeping track of which tiles are in front of or behind the screen, only placing four tiles from behind the screen, only laying corals twice on a turn, etc. but it doesn't take all that long to get the hang of it.

Aside from the quirks and the rulebook, it's fantastic. Some push-your-luck in balancing getting the cube you want with getting that cube when it's full of tiles. More press-your-luck in deciding when to consume (though getting that first consume seems pretty crucial). Plays really well with two. It's "stabby", but "thinky stabby" (as in, a conflict-ridden optimization problem) rather than "stabby stabby" (as in, the objective is simply to attack others, ala Small World and its ilk) ... to the point where my wife gets angry at me when we play (love it!).

After playing, I understand the "stock manipulation" categorization (though I don't enjoy deconstructing games so surgically) ala Acquire. I think this one is great. Up to a 10.

-------------------------------------------------------

I really, really liked my play of this. There is a lot going on and the rules are a mess and the gameplay is pretty complicated. Still. There are a lot of fascinating elements. Going for corals quickly (it's not too hard to pull out some scorable corals early on) or try to drop a huge coral late. The coral strength and consuming corals is fascinating, not least because you want to consume opponents' corals but also because you often will also want to consume your own coral. That you can't consume all coral types (well, you can, if you include the initial token) means that you're certainly going to be gaming against certain colors. Scoring only at the beginning of a round has sort of a press-your-luck element ... it's all really excellent and I'm eager to explore further.

RATING: 7
Strip away the unusual aquatic theme and Reef Encounter can be viewed as a game of set collection with an element of stock market manipulation.  Yet nothing in this game is quite that straightforward.  The set collection has a spacial element - our sets are laid on a grid for others to nibble away at before we can collect them.  As well as determining value, that stock market also determines the relative strengths of the varieties of coral we are collecting, which are highly significant when it comes to nibbling.  That sort of inter-dependence runs through every element of Reef Encounter, which is one of the reasons it is hard to get your head around it at first.  The other is a rulebook that really shouldn't have left the object of the game until last.  Get over those bumps and there is a challenging, thinky, interactive game that still seems very novel. 

The artwork of the R&D edition is a little washed out for my taste.  While the patterns of the white and grey polyps are quite different, they are a little too close in colour.  Production quality is very good and those shrimps are very cute.

Very good tile placement game with a unique and interesting theme. The rules seem weird at first but after a few rounds everything falls into place.

After my first initial plays I gave RE a 7.5 rating.  After a number more plays I've upped that rating to 8.

Reminds me of Euphrat & Tigris, but has much more resource-management aspect since you don't draw to complete your hand at the end of a turn.  Rules are so precisely and drily written that you can read the entire book without understanding a single word.  Could go up with further play.

RATING: 8
So far I've rated this game an 8 because there's a lot to like about it.  The things that keep it from being higher: a) There's a lot of downtime especially with over-analytical players because there are so many choices and your decisions are all intertwined with each other, b) this game really rewards spatial reasoning, which means that I'm really not that good at it, c) the colors are confusing.  You have player colors (yellow, red, blue, green), coral polyp tile colors and associated larva cubes (yellow, pink, orange, white, grey), and algae cylinder colors (red, green, blue, purple).  None of which relate to each other.  In addition, the pink cubes don't seem to match the pink tiles very well, and the purple cylinders don't match the purple symbol on the coral strength tiles very well, d) the game is slightly more strategic (as opposed to tactical) than I'd like - I prefer a higher balance of tactics to strategy, whereas I would say tactics and strategy are about equal in Reef Encounter...  possibly slightly tilted toward strategy, e) the box insert sucks.

All in all, though, a good, deep game with lots of interaction, and lots of interesting decisions.

A competitive tactical exercise in growing and destroying coral reefs.  The game is very good and the theme is well-integrated, but I am not sure that it makes any sense.

Why are some corals worth more than other corals?  It seems like this started as a variant to Acquire: the corals abstractly represent business entities fighting for market share.  The board that displays which corals dominate other corals then makes a lot more sense: this represents some kind of aggregation of stock price, consumer sentiment, and legal conflict.

the rules are hard to explain, but okay once known.  i like the production of the z-man edition minus a few things: the holes in the reefs are not clear enough, the purple/pink mismatch, and the fact that there are white and black as colors instead of more pronounced things.  there is a bit of chaos in terms of how much can change by the time it becomes your turn.  one would hope that this time could be used to analyze a future move, but it isn't bankable.  if the turns flowed better in terms of pacing and had less AP promotion i would definitely like it better.  btw, i'm referring to a wishful lack of clunkiness, not necessarily reduced time spent.  it seems like the final turn tile flips play a massive role in the outcome of the game, even though they can be pinned beforehand.  i think it would be better with 2 or 4, but i probably won't end up playing it again.  i do concede that the shreeples are awesome.

Might have been the most painful game-learning experience of my life.  Rules are incredibly unintuitive.  Downtime (4 players) was far too long.  Entire experience felt pretty flat and unexciting.  Theme was worse than pasted on... more like post-it'd on...

On a side note, not very color blind friendly either.  My red-green color blind friend was perpetually confused by the color matching for the entire game... though I dare say, confusion was not limited to just her...

The rule book wording is terrible and anyone trying to learn the game from them is bound to find the game awkward at best.  If you are fortunate enough to be taught the game by someone who knows the rules, then the game is a solid design with a nice theme.  At its heart the game is a majorities game, but the factors that influence the scores is where the beauty lies.  Manipulating the coral hierarchy is key and knowing when to lock in a coral will ensure a players success.  Despite the board and the shrimples, the game is really played out on the influence board.  Definitely worth a playing, but please, please learn it from someone and skip the rulebook. [GTI: APSD]

I really like the artwork and that Breese was inspired by Sir David Attenborough's documentary, Blue Planet.  A supreme example of translating an ecological system into a game system.  The game scales well between different player numbers. My only complaint is the downtime between player turns, though there is considerable player interaction throughout the game and plenty to think about while your waiting for your turn. 

[9/7/09] I now own the R&D version of this game and its expansion--my precious. Used, slightly battered box and off-centered expansion tiles, but still my first grail game acquisition.

A gift for Sarah, which she quite likes! It's awfully like Tigris and Euphrates but even more weirdly complex. It's quite an interesting puzzle to figure out how to teach, given how reliant every action is on every other one.

I'm on the fence about this one.  Having to replenish specific colored tiles from the bag is annoying as is the downtime associated with players having so many options during their turn.  Difficult to teach to newcomers.  There is lots of potential for clever play though, it's quite a deep game.

It's a nice game, with very interesting mechanics. The problem is it's very complex, much more so than what appears at first sight. I'll try it a couple more times to see if I really like it once I finally "get it". For now, it's somehow fun, somehow interesting, but not an excellent game.

UPDATE: It's too complex for me. I like some deep games, but this one just doesn't click with me. The theme also doesn't help a lot for my tastes. Down to a 6.

The rules are a little daunting at first.  There is a lot going on in this innocent looking game.  Lot's to think about.  It takes a bit of time for most of us to really get it.  I think if you can get through 2 or 3 plays it will reward you with a deep experience.

update:  For some reason this game didn't end up sticking.  While not an exact copy it felt too much like Tigris and Euphrates too keep.  Traded.

+ Very unique game: thematically as well as design wise.
+ The game has its own rhythm, you'll have to go with the flow...
- It can be a real brain burner, that's why we don't play it that much.
! Best with 2 players because of the downtime.

Very good game. A lot of decisions on each term. If you like to slow play, this is your baby. If you like to control pieces of wood that resemble shrimp, this is your baby. If you like a board that changes completely between each of your turns, this is your baby. If you like to eat coral, this is your baby. 
Sometimes I think I know what I'm doing, and sometimes I don't think I know what I'm doing. I lose regardless. 

Update: After more plays, my rating has increased. Give it some time..

Teljesen egyedi a látványvilág, a téma, és a mechanizmus. A játék egy jól felépített egész, semmiféle hiányérzetem nem volt. A legötletesebb rész az, ahogy a hierarchia alakul a játék során. Bármikor felborulhat az erősorrend, mert nem a mennyiség, hanem inkább a minőség számít a korallok elfogyasztásánál. Nem túl komplex, annak ellenére, hogy a szabállyal azért meg kellett küzdeni, kicsit logikátlan a sorrendje. A kedvenceimtől nagyon kevés választja el. Bármikor játszanék vele!

Excellent game.  It really seems you are fighting against corals.  It is a heavy game, and changes a lot, but this is the good part! Adapt yourself to the strength of corals!

At first sight, the rules are quite complex: you probably need a while before you can master such a mechanism (well, the first play was quite awful...), but when you do, this game can offer a lot. It's a shame that it's probably too heavy to be played as often as it deserves.

First Impression: This game, although an abstract tilelaying game at heart, was fun. The components are attractive and the gameplay was fairly quick. The mechanisms in the game feel a little forced together but the overall result is an enjoyable game with a puzzle-like quality to it. The direct player interaction is what will keep me coming back for more.

Played once with 4 players.  My one and only session of this game took forever to start.  No one knew the rules so we had to "learn to play" as we played.  Naturally this turned me off for I hate wasting time during a gaming session listening to someone read the entire rules straight from a rulebook!  Dreadful.

Reef Encounter has some nice puzzle aspects and tile flipping that can be fun to figure out, but it also features random tile draws that can either help or hinder certain players.  

Update: The gameplay is uninuitive, but if you play against someone actually familiar with the rules, you can learn from example.

I really, really want to like this.  Everything it has going on points at me liking it, but I can't seem to get my head around it, rules and strategy.  I've played on Spielbyweb and f2f.  f2f makes more sense to me, but I think someone needs to sit down and teach me the game.

Otherwise, it has lots of interesting things going on throughout the game and many options for each player on their turn.  Each stage of the game is well linked and it is themed well.  I just wish I understood it better.

[i]Posted: 4/16/06, Rated: 8[/i]

A gorgeous game with lots of [i]bits[/i] -- a common trait among Richard Breese games (along with player screens).  The shrimps alone are almost legendary.

The theme is interesting and educational.  The components look great, in my opinion.  The [i]rules...[/i] frankly the rules [i]stink[/i].  This is not to say that it is a bad game.  Quite the contrary: I really enjoy [i]Reef Encounter[/i].  But if you don't have the benefit of learning the game from someone who has played it before, then trying to learn from scratch really hurts.  Minus one point for the rules.

[i]Reef Encounter[/i] introduced me to the unique mechanism of sharing a number of common boards.  It is a tile laying game, that plays out like a series of small area control games.  You use your shrimps to defend your territory.

If that was all there was to the game, then it would be good.  A little average, but still good.  The variable color-dominance pushes [i]Reef Encounter[/i] towards being a great game.  Just like rock-paper-scissors, certain color tiles can "eat" (overbuild) some colors, while being weak to others.  However, as the game progresses, you have the ability to change the relationships.  You can make a particular color very strong, able to "eat" more colors than it could at the start of the game.  This mechanic also influences the scoring at the end of the game, and so it is doubly-important.

The tactical challenges of a tile-laying game combined with an overarching strategic element make for an exciting game.  Add an interesting, eye-catching theme, and [i]Reef Encounter[/i] is a hit.

The rules are dreadfully unclear and took some effort to wade through. After that it all became clear and what we have is a masterful little game that mixes strategy with a need for aggressive action in order to win. The algae switching and locking the priorities of the corals attacking potential is genius. The more I play RE the more I like it, raised rating to 9.Deep and engaging this has to be a top 10 favorite.

SetCollection, Solo

Game flow: Like the Gulf Stream.
Strategic depth: Like the ocean.
Theme: Dripping with it.
  
I really like this game!  Of Richard Breese's offerings, this one hits the nail on the head from the bat.  The game is simpler in some ways than T&E (coral interactions between each other and the shrimp, the meat of the game), and more complex in others (more options that can be bought using consumed coral tiles, and the coral strength/algae relationships).
  
I have to admit that I like the theme of Reef Encounter better than T&E, but it's nice to have both games on hand for variety.  Both are excellent, classic games.  Incidentally, both share certain characteristics with Sackson's Acquire, another classic game... but that's another story.
  
I keep this game around (even though it would make pretty awesome trade fodder) for the theme and the tile-laying T&E/Acquire-ish mechanics.  I really like the strategies here, particularly the limited shrimps, and the coral chomping.  The algae interactions are nicely done, and give the game a dynamic aspect.  This can induce analysis paralysis, of course... but I like the game regardless because of that.  You really do need to plan ahead and determine exactly what algae tiles your opponents will want to lock down, and when they can do it.

This game is fun and has some neat mechanics. I also like how well they tied the theme and the mechanics together. It took me a couple of plays to "get" it, but now that I do I really enjoy it. I introduced it to a marine biologist friend and she said that it is actually a fairly accurate simulation of the coral reef ecosystem. Not perfect, but probably as close as you could get in a game.

RATING: 4.5
Rating after single play (so weigh accordingly) with 4.  It felt very luck-of-the-draw driven, but did evidence some balancing mechanisms.  It is certain that I did not comprehend most of what I was doing for the first third of the game.  This game will almost certainly rise with further playings, but this first play left me with "meh".

The more I play this game, the better I like it.  It is very involved and it hurt my head the first four plays.  Now, it is one of the most rewarding games I play and I just love it.  

For me, the theme is also quite fun.  It feels like an abstract game, but at the same time, I feel like I am playing an abstract game in the ocean, which is great.  For anyone looking for a deep, rewarding game, who is willing to play it atleast four times before making any lasting judgments about it, the game is fantastic.  It is currently one of my new favorites, which is odd since I have owned the game fore about three years now.

I do not know why, but I don't like this game much. Seeing as how I grade the games on their playability/fun factor/general appeal, this game would have had higher scores if I could figure out a way to enjoy it. Lots of options, but the theme is a little 'ugh' to me. Not the easiest one to teach to non-gamers either.

RATING: 9
This game is a brain burner. It needs real skill to work the right balance between growing corals, keeping them high in the dominance table to score more points and be able with another colour to feed on your main one so to provide you with necessary surplus tiles (necessary to fast grow bigger corals and to supply you with larvas if needed). Of course this have to be done keeping an eye on your opponent and eating if necessary and possible their polips as well.
Last but not least, the resupply system hamper players going for just one colour. Often you get just larva or polyp tiles needed, not both, and it's up to you choose what to get.
Multicolour tactic works better, but make more challenging to keep control on the dominance table.
A very good and original game, with some system taken by T&E.
If you like the latter, it's a must.

Reef Encounter shares some similarities to two games that I really admire- Tigris and Euphrates and Acquire. Here you have personal groups of tiles rather than the "shared" groups of T&E. The comparison to Acquire is faint- the game has tiles which are played in a sort of abstract fashion- but in RE there is a market in which you adjust the value of the different chains (acquire) or colors (RE) as opposed to the system present in Acquire. Instead of shares in the various colors/chains you create your own groups and manipulate the market to increase the values of your favorite colors. (the tiles you intend to score at game end) 

The game is very interactive and allows for some creative tactical play. The game does not hold your hand, against skilled opponents you will be punished for misplays and overly aggressive tile plays. It's a rather tight game when play correctly- driven by an almost "race-like" game progression, where the tempo and rhythm of the game is very palatable. 

The game plays well through all player counts, though I suspect 3P is it's sweet spot with a relatively close 2P game as well. Four players see's the game get more tactical and chaotic, whereas with two, the game feels it's most strategic and abstract. 

It's rules are more opaque than the game plays out. It might take a couple of plays to feel like you know what you're doing. It's a pretty heavy game. I'd say heavier that T&E, not by much. It feels similar in depth, though the rules are more lush given the market and rules for eaten tiles and such. 

I'm very glad "nyuhase" has this game. If she didn't have it, this would be one of the first games I'd buy. It's that good. I imagine it will continue to be in my top tier of games for some time.

Cube confusion!

No but seriously, here are some strategies I'm working on.

Play to the initial tile dropped into your parrotfish. Try to pick one that is what some but not all of the other players are going for. Do not got behind in the shrimp eating. Stay with the leader or be the leader. Remember that the final coral hierarchy determines the score, not just the locked ones. Try to place last and keep some consumed polyp tiles for last score adjustment.

There are about 3 different mechanics working in this game.  Each one works and they work together fairly well.  But, they don't make [i]sense[/i] together for me.  And how they apply to the theme, and why I'm doing them (beyond their purpose as a game mechanic) don't make any sense to me.  I guess I'm saying that I think the theme is more than painted on (which I don't mind in games), but outright doesn't fit onto the mechanics.

I own the Z-man version and though the gray tiles are more distinctive, I prefer the look of the original release.

Time will tell whether this is a classic but it certainly makes a good first impression. Lots of factors to consider on your turn and the game has great "shape" as corals try to outgrow each other while setting up big scoring opportunities.

Far too fiddly and under-developed, a fact quickly internalized upon reading the rules.  Among the few games where the rules evaded my understanding.  Even the much maligned in this area T&E embedded itself pretty clearly.  Overly analytical with much of it coming from rough and opaque mechanisms rather than  more interesting sources.  

Consider the contortions required to attain consumed polyp tiles (a mechanism by itself unnecessarily convoluted).  Is this fun?  Finally, the board plays fails to generate any tension as the shrimps constrict board play very well, because even when the bigger corals come out they are quickly eaten and the board starts afresh, heck the game starts again.  Absolutely no theme or coherent gameplay experience.  Finally, the scoring and eating mechanism feels like a tacked on subgame rather than something that genuniely influences the rest of the game.  Knizian polish is nowhere to be found here.  Overhyped and overwrought.

I have a really hard time teaching how to play this game, because everything is so circular.  And I can't really explain why this game appeals to me.

Hard one to rate - clever ideas, great theme, amazing bits... but perhaps a touch too random for my liking.  I'd like to try this with 2 to see if it is more strategic... but no, not really.  I wonder if 3 is the best number?  After 2 plays with 4, 1 play with 3, 2 plays with 2.

Interesting, but long.  1 play.  Almost too much to analyze on a given turn.  Moderate learning curve since there are definitely superior tile placement patterns to be learned; also there are some "domino effects" that you need to be aware of.  This game falls into the same category as Tigris & Euphrates for me... games that I tend to over analyze (and play extremely slowly) because it's easy to get sucked into trying to figure out the pro's & con's of every move.  Rating might improve now that I have one game under my belt... especially if I use a game timer so that my buddies won't hate me for long turns.

This game by Richard breese reminds you so very much of Key Harvest which is also the same in at least 3-4 ways.

1) Competing for won tiles.
2) Various actions allow you to gain privelages that when timed properly exploit ways to increase basic scoring into multiplied scoring.
3) The victory points spreads end up being very close.
4) The game seems extremely delicate... in that if you dont take advantage of various scoring opportunities... you will not be blown away,  but you certainly won't win either.

Nice game, but a bit shy on excitment.

I enjoyed my three 2-player games of this.  It's a little hard to wrap your brain around.  In essence it's a game where you are trying to maximize the VP value of certain goods that you consume now for end-game VPs.  THere's a certain area control element to it and a balance between going full-ahead now versus holding back till you have a better "hand" later.  I like it, but I'm not sure how much play it will see.

I really enjoy this one on SBW.  Just got it and am looking forward to playing FtF.

1st play FtF, 2 yrs later.  2 player.  This is an excellent game, but a brain burner.  Looking at least 1 turn ahead is a must, but in the 2 player game, you need to be planning more like 2 or 3 turns ahead.  We probably need a few more games before familiarity makes the decisions tractable.  
2nd play, 2er: Awesome game!  The more I play, the more I like.  Rated an 8.5, because I could see a few circumstances where I'm just too tired to put my brain through this, but otherwise I would always play this.

It was alright but nothing spectacular. There seems to be more enjoyable alternatives for what this has to offer. Will need to replay to reconsider its rating.

Update from 2006 to 2017. Raised from 6 to 7.5. Some 10 years later, revisited it with someone having well prepped it. It was SO much better. It has shades of Tigris and Euphrates. The theme is exceptionally unique. However, it is an abstract at heart. (I love abstracts, so that's not a problem for me).

The only good game Breese has invented. But it is a good one.

Quite an involved game with plenty going on, it is good that there are so many elements which combine together as it really makes this game one worth thinking about while playing.
This is the first game my wife has bought - and she loves the aesthetics of it as well enjoying playing. 

Will need to play more before rating properly!

Updated: Played more.  An intricate game of checks and balances.  There are plenty of things you want to do, and usually plenty of things in your road.  The game is involved but interesting.  I really like it, the theme comes through to an unusal extent for a game of this style, and yet the game play is typical of a heavier euro style game.  A rich and interesting game, well worth investigating.  It will likely take a couple of games before things really start to click though.

Reef Encounter is another lovely game from Z-Man; seriously, does anyone make games that are as nice as he?  This is our first Richard Breese, and I'm impressed.  The theme and mechanics are well integrated for a Euro, and so far I haven't been able to wrap my head around this one.  At first it seems like there is too much space on the boards, and you're craving more conflict - and there is some, but you could also do the multi-player solitaire thing and make out ok.  Playing that way will definitely not optimize your points, though.  The game continually pushes you to plan more than you can do, and it is surprisingly tough to eat other corals or do the few other things the instructions say are "key."  A nice brain-burn, not too intense, but that may be because I don't understand a clear path to victory yet.

RATING: 8
Very interesting, challenging abstract game with enough of a theme to hold my attention. The game is not nearly as cute as it pretends to be, however. In fact, it can be downright cruel. It reminds me a lot of Tigris and Euphrates: area control, attacks using tile dominance, and scoring in multiple colors. I actually think I might prefer this to T&E, though only some more plays will tell.

RATING: 6
UPDATE: I played this again recently and it forced me to downgrade my rating. I think Reef Encounter is really clever for about the first half of the game, but once players have consumed a couple reefs and a few corals have been locked, the game totally dries up as competition for space completely falls off and the room for maneuver narrows. I wish the game could remain more consistently interesting for the entire length. I'm optimistic that the expansion will ultimately provide in this area, but my enthusiasm for the base game just isn't what it used to be.

I played the Z-Man games edition for the first time, and they've done a pretty nice job with it. The day-glo cubes are a little jarring, but other than that the darker, highly saturated colors have a nice look. I personally prefer the brighter colors of the original, even with the slightly too-close white and grey tiles, but the new one is nice too.

Capsule Review: http://homepage.mac.com/c_farrell/iblog/C2097221587/E648403382/index.html

I like Reef Encounter, but time has shown it to not have as much replayability as I'd like. I like the wonderful colors, I like the thematic gameplay, and I think it does present the player with lots of interesting tactical decision points ... but the tile-laying portion is so reminiscent of Tigris & Euphrates, and T&E is just a vastly superior game by any measure. The growth of the reefs is just too constrained, and the on-board play doesn't have the dynamicism or the organic feel of Tigris & Euphrates. Reefs expand from a couple tiles to 5 or 6, and then get eaten, and once a few have been eaten, the board becomes too sparse, with not enough interaction.

Still, having said all this, Reef Encounter is still a good game which I'm happy to own and happier to play than most people I game with. But like most every Richard Breese game, it seems to have greatness in its grasp but not quite be able to achieve it.

Updated 7/12/10.

[thing=12962]Reef Encounter[/thing] was a game that I’d long desired, but that I had refrained from purchasing because I had feared that it wouldn’t resonate with any of my traditional gaming partners.  Billed as some kind of underwater bastard child of [thing=42]Tigris & Euphrates[/thing] and [thing=5]Acquire[/thing] (both of which I love), I had hoped the game to be superficially innocuous enough to engage my not-yet-hardcore gaming group, but laden with enough deep and subtle strategies to scratch my itch.  

While I’m certain that such strategies exist, they were entirely beyond my grasp in the first two plays.  In both games, my wife won handily by simply feeding her parrotfish regularly, while positioning her coral in a way that stifled any hope I had for growth.  In fact, I was unable to consume a single tile in the first game.  It’s not the losing that I mind, mind you, but that I’m unable to even conceive of a counter-measure to her incredibly simple strategy (Build a 5-6 tile coral; place a shrimp.  Eat said coral; build another 5-6 tile coral).  I can’t help but feel that I’m either playing by incorrect rules or that I’m simply inconsolably (and perhaps irreparably) out-of-sync with the game.  Meanwhile, my failing as an opponent has also led my wife to dismiss the game as simplistic and childish (the cutesy eyes on the shrimp didn’t help). :soblue:

One of the primary sources of my difficulty was my inability to maintain a steady flow of tiles and cubes of the right colors.  In the first game, by the end of the first turn, I had only two tiles behind my screen.  Even after passing for the next two turns, I was unable to do anything more than grow a two-tile coral, which seemed to be a waste of an action.  It reminded me a bit of [thing=43015]Hansa Teutonica[/thing]’s early game, where players can accomplish so little on such an open board, that the game seems a bit pointless.  But where HT quickly ramps up into a mad scramble in the wake of an imminent end, Reef Encounter simply putters along at this pace until the game ends (which was at least mercifully quickly). 

In other games (e.g., [thing=28720]Brass[/thing], [thing=12681]Neuland[/thing]), such a frustrating start has motivated me to grapple with the strategy, ponder the game in my free time, and put it back on the table as often as possible until I truly understood it.  Perhaps because at this stage I’ve yet to even glimpse the game’s tantalizing potential, or perhaps because many aspects of the game don’t appeal to me in practice (the tile draw on the open sea board strikes me as both too random, and too upkeep-heavy to justify the mechanic; flipping the dominance tiles in colored sets is AP-inducing, but not in a fun “thinky” way), Reef Encounter has not had that effect.  Instead, I’m inclined to simply write it off as a game with which I just don’t connect.  

One final note: I was a bit disappointed with the components of the Z-man edition.  The tiles were smaller than I thought; the paint on the algae cylinders isn’t remotely close to the color on the dominance tiles; the slots to assemble the parrotfish tiles were too narrow, resulting in considerable damage to the cardboard components when assembled (we’ve just left them assembled and out of the box for fear of doing more damage when taking them apart); the included bag was too small to hold all the tiles and allow for shuffling; and the linen texture on the box and tiles feels unpleasantly artificial.

Richard Breese's magnum opus. This is a tile laying game similar to Tigris & Euphrates. Surprisingly, I suspect I might prefer this to T&E but I will need to play both titles more before I decide. Reef Encounter (like T&E) plays like Go or Chess, offering a broad strategic horizon, emphasis on maneuver, and more direct conflict among players. This is in contrast to most other euro "strategy" games that seem to emphasize efficiency and resource management. The positional aspect of Reef Encounter in particular feels like a war game stripped of its theme and reduced to its bare essence. I've played with 2, 3, and 4 players and although it's an enjoyable game with any number of players, the fewer the better. It's especially good with 2 and 3, becoming slightly chaotic with 4.

The game itself is beautiful but I have mixed feelings about the theme. It's rather dry, despite modeling an underwater environment (ahaw, how droll I am) but the theme is definitely not pasted on. Playing Reef Encounter really does evoke the feeling of an underwater ecosystem, to a certain degree at least (it's nothing like, say, American Megafauna. This is still a euro afterall).

UPDATE: After several plays of this and T&E, I think T&E is a significantly better game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The game here is all about timing your eating. The longer you wait, the better idea you'll have regarding the valuation of the various corals and the more coral you'll get per bite, but you could find yourself not eating all four of your shrimp as the game ends before you really get going. Go quickly and you can control the tempo and when the game ends, but your coral might not be the most valuable ones.

Turn by turn, while some are of the take some tiles and pass variety, there are opportunities for explosive play where one does tricks with how the various mechanisms interrelate.

The game can be vicious as well, because attacking someone else's coral reef not only takes them down a peg, it also boosts your own capacities to control the game.

The game itself is an interesting simulation, as while you do not take on the role of any particular member of the ecosystem, by using the rules to try and win, you do recreate it. Documentary style.

The game's biggest flaw is its barrier to entry. The rules. There are quite a few things you need to learn before you can start playing. It flows well once you start, but getting there can be rough, and the first game will be a learning game.

RATING: 6
Based on 1 play with 2 players:

The six is based off of how much fun I eventually had with the game by the end of our first game, though I think my real rating could go in either direction.

First, the game's rulebook really makes your first play a truly unpleasant experience. It opts for its own "flavorful" terminology over standard terms at every turn, so it takes you a good half of the game before you even understand what you're doing.

Second, the strategy in your first game is going to seem very opaque indeed. There's a LOT going on here, and the complex machinery of interwoven systems is really something to behold. It's interesting, and possibly deep, but...

Third, at times the game can feel too restrictive. Once you set down a path you're pretty stuck in it, and I often found myself feeling handcuffed by my options.

Fourth, the downtime is a nightmare. I can't imagine playing this with four.

If complex, brain-burning interplay of systems is your thing this is probably a must-play. But for me, I think I'd rather have something that is a straight-up puzzle or something a little more free-form.

Update: This has been sitting on my shelf for years, unplayed. The idea of ever going back to that rulebook has lost all appeal. Will probably trade.

Powerful and stunning tile laying game. The ecology of a coral reef is abstractly depicted here.  The depth of game play and wide array of choices may be intimidating for some but, anyone willing to immerse themselves in game play will be rewarded.

The game rules need not be difficult for everyone to understand.  My 7-year old grasps the rules easily however, the best strategies and tactics are not easily grasped by anyone.  Reef Encounter will provide you many hours of engrossing game play and discovery.

While I am not generally enamoured of tile placement games, this one is exceptional.  The intricate blend of game mechanics is marvelous - drafting, set collection, tile placement, area control, and commodity speculation are all here.  Impressively (and contrary to the opinion of many), the gameplay does fit the theme well; corals grow, become eroded by their neighbours, are eaten by parrotfishes, and vie for dominance during the game, and doing these things feels "natural".  The mechanism by which consumed polyps can be exchanged for algae that one uses to alter the hierarchy of different coral types is brilliant.  The ideas are executed masterfully, even if the shit rulebook might make one think otherwise (at least until you play your first game).  Highly recommended!

Beautiful, intense, brain-burning game.  So good over the board...spielbyweb is Ok.  Depending on the way you play over the web, you either have too much information or not nearly enough.  I suck at this too, which makes it all the more intriguing.  I want to be part of the "I get Reef Encounter club." The Z-man production is also gorgeous.  Don't get me wrong, I like the other one too.  They are just different is all.  The original version looks more like an oddity, or a work of art, whereas this production focuses on the thematic side of the gameplay.  Good with 2-4 also...I'm just absolutely fascinated still after 15-20 games.

T&E does this much better. The art and theme I find kind of stupid, and there is just too much going on. Feels very over-designed. Please someone find this game an editor. 

For me, very abstracted games like this need to have very clean rules and intuitive gameplay (ie. El Grande). Every added layer of complexity should make the game more evocative. These hyper-complex abstract games always feel more like headache-inducing puzzles than games to me. That's fine, but it's not for me.

Wow! I cannot compare the mechanics to any other eurogame, and along with some very tough decisions during the game, this has resulted in a high rating. The idea of the corals' change in strength by flipping the tiles back and forth throughout the game is great, and even though you might have eaten a lot of coral tiles during the game, you won't win if your coral tiles are weak. Also, the other players might suddenly make a strong play of certain polyp tiles which you have locked earlier, which makes it very hard to ruin their plans!

It's also a delightfully aggressive euro game, which is a scarcity in my opinion, and this makes it stand even more out from the rest of the euro games. It plays very well with 2 and 3; 4 isn't great as the boards change too much during your turns so it's hard to plan ahead and there isn't anything to do when it's not your time.

As if that wasn't enough, the game has nice artwork and a unique theme, and though I don't really care for those two things in a board game, it obviously never detracts from a rating when the artwork is nice to look at. Great game!

Rated 7 after one play, but this is a tough one to rate. This might be one of the more convoluted games I've played. The rules are not that complicated, but good play is not immediately clear. I enjoy watching the different corals played on the board, but how to best use tactics to score is hard to "grok" on a first play.

This game is going to demand a handful of plays to clearly learn proper strategies.  After more plays I'll get a better sense of a rating. 

Update: 2nd play, and I'm liking this a bit more. I didn't feel as lost, and it's a lot more fun when the tactical options become more familiar. This also was a two player game, and that kept things simpler.

Update: Well, I eventually sold this one in an auction. This one sat on the shelf for quite some time. Too hard for my wife, and too many of my local gaming friends were uninterested. I think it's a good game, but I got tired watching it collect dust.

RATING: 7
I don't usually make comments about box art or rulebooks, but I feel that the Z-Man games release has some major problems with these.  First of all, the product description on the back of the box looks like it was typeset by an 8-year-old; if I hadn't read about this game in advance, there's a good chance I would've decided to never buy it simply based on the font on the back of the box.  The rules are written with absolutely horrible grammar.  Naturally, I don't expect perfectly written rules from board games, especially since so many are translated from German or other languages, but this one was the worst I've seen in quite a while.

I've heard many complaints that the mangled rules were difficult to understand, but I didn't find this the case...I just winced even 15 seconds while reading them.

That pickiness aside, I liked the game ("interesting"), but I wouldn't say I loved it or hated it.  I thought I'd be more excited about the gameplay from reading the rules, but the game is simply "okay" to me.  It seems to me that with smaller numbers of players, one player with the right set of tiles can blitz through to the end (quickly eating all shrimp) and edge out players who are agonizing over perfect reefs and coral card heirarchies.

Update: This is a very solid game that needs to come out more. It has a lot of what I like about both T&E and Imperial.
Play note: Extending an opponents coral (especially if it isn't big and it eats another opponent that is) is a good way to get consumed polyps quickly and in the right colors. Allows for some pretty bad ass moves later. 

2/2/10:Two plays in with Natalie and I'm liking it, but I think I'm going to have to play with gamers. She's not liking it like I hoped she would and she doesn't push me up the learning curve. First impressions were that this game is more like Imperial than anything. The pump-and-squeeze cycle just feels similar. If anything, I can imagine liking this better because it feels like it has more tactical possibility while at the same time allowing for a lot of manipulation of values in the endgame. I'm very eager to play more and with more players.

Very interesting build/harvest patterns and mechanic intersections.  Euphrat & Tigris done right.  I like the trade offs between board influence and scoring in particular.  Excessively tactical with 4.  3 players is the  sweet spot with 2 players also being very good.

BASE GAME

Convoluted rules, but actually really simple when you get into it. A few layers to think about. Ways to turn the tables. A bit of a Carcassonne vibe in that you're trying to build up a large group of tiles and cash in before your opponent can get in your way. Pays to play a little aggressive. Good components and the theme generally fits the rules, for as abstract as they are.

Also has a bit of an economic thing going on when consuming, influencing and trading in bits.

Cute, lighthearted them, deep game.  Sort of reminds me of Tigris & Euphrates in how the tiles all interact with each other and the great variety of combinations that can be put down.  It's not a bad game with two, but I think it's better if you have more.  It does feel a little long at times, but it certainly is a solid game.

Another excellent Breese design.  All the parts fit together seamlessly as you build your little ocean cycle.  Growth takes death feeding it and it is interesting to see the waves of action during a turn.  The shifting dominance and values of the coral inserts enough chaos into a real thinker of a game.

RATING: 9
There are loads of things to consider with each move.  I like the dual nature of the tiles and determining the best timing as to when it is best to use them as cash on hand for future positioning, or when to use them as commodities.  
There is also a strong commodity speculation aspect in the early game that I find fascinating, and then the fight for coral dominance for final scoring.  These aspects, along with the consumption of corals by other corals create a very interesting tug of war dynamic as your position tends to ebb and flow throughout the game.

The rule book is a pain... watch some videos instead.  This is one of those games where everything moves in cycles, and almost like intertwined gears, so there is no easy entry point to start explaining the game.

There is a great level of planning and caginess in this game. The theme is quirky and it works well. I feel like there is so much going on that I can't get my head around it. At least in that sense its reminiscent of Tigris and Euphrates. Beyond that, I'm not sure the comparisons are so apt.

One thing I'm not so sure of is the start position balance. You get more tiles if you go later in the turn order...and there are equal boards to the number of players so, theoretically, everyone should get to start with the benefit of a "bonus" tile if they choose. But I'd like to see some stats for thousands of plays with win percentage from each position. Just curious. 

Either way, this game has beautiful components (I've only played the reprint version, but have seen the original, too). 

The variable game ending is where the game derives its tension, more than anything. I think its THAT mechanic which is most similar to Tigris and Euphrates. I also really like the ability to modify your (or your opponent's) scores after the points are 'in the bank' or parrotfish as it were.

RATING: 7
Reef Encounter is a heavy tile laying and stock manipulation game by indie game designer Richard Breese. The core concept behind the game is controlling large polyp clusters on an undersea rock (guarded by your shrimp) and then having them devoured by your feeder fish. The game play is essentially a multi-nuanced tile laying system where one collects both tiles and cubes. The cubes must be used to allow you to place the tiles, and the value of the tiles is charted on another board. Said value is important for both the end game scoring and in game play, as the value of the tile is tied directly to its ability in game to be placed over the top of other tiles, thus generating another resource, eaten tiles, which are very important as they can be used to manipulate the tile dominance structure. Thus, the resource structure basically breaks down into: tiles, cubes used to play tiles, tiles which you have consumed with other tiles. The previously consumed tiles are of particular importance because they can be used not only to change or lock tile dominance states on a sub-board, but they can also be exchanged for cubes (thus allowing the placement of yet more tiles) or be reused onto the board with a normal cube play. Yes, that was a summary. Yes, this game has a lot going on.

Learning when to just take your polyp tiles and larva cube and end your turn rather than play stuff out is an important skill. My initial impulse was to want to do something semi-major each turn, and Reef Encounter instead encourages building up some resources slowly, and then letting them explode in a mad rush of activity. Seperate boards, while a novel new idea, seem to make the game more defensive than I might like. I don't mind defensive postures being possible, but in Reef shutting off entire sections of a given board is not only possible, but recommended, which limits interactions between the players a bit more than I would like. This isn't to say that you aren't playing against them directly at all, everything is very dependent on what the opposition is doing, I just think the overall defensive nature of this game didn't mesh with my particular temperment for whatever reason. There are many interesting tricks you can pull once you start figuring out the mechanics, but I kept feeling as though the game was missing something. RE is not bad by any means, just not top tier.

NB
I'm becomming aware that abstract games are not my taste and this refects in my opinion of many games).  The theme on many simple games are painted on to level I find difficult.

Games in this grouping:
Taluva
Lost Cities
Bohanza
Jet Set
Junta
Enemy in Sight
Naval War

Some more complex game have a level of abstration that does not meet my expectation for the theme/subject etc.  This makes the game a less compelling experience.

Games in this grouping:
Elder Signs
Reef Encounter
Modern Naval Battles
The Fury of Dracula

My enthusiasm for these games is limited by a level of abstraction that challenges my taste and my rating reflects this.

One Play.  Ouch.  Did someone get the number of that truck?  There's a lot going on here and I understand that it's one of those games where you have to consider your first play an investment in future enjoyment but this was brutal.  And slow.  After playing it someone compared it to T&E and I can see the point but to me a big difference is the fact that in RE you know what kind of times your opponents have been picking up and that just adds layers of information to keep straight.  Will play it again someday.

RATING: 9
It is unfortunate that with 4 players the feel of the game is so different (and in my opinion, less) than it is with 2. With 2, the game is cerebral and very strategic&mdash;rather like a chess match, but in a completely different way. With 4 there is distinct downtime, lack of player interaction (resistance against your plans is much more diffuse), and probably worst of all too much change on the boards between player turns. There are precisely two moments when you need to pay attention to what others do: when they eat a coral, and when they take new tiles. The rest is simply not important (unless you desire to pick up new tricks).

Despite the somewhat questionable scalability, the game structure is so unique and so completely non-linear (read: circular) that you are likely to find yourself doing things which are seemingly the complete opposite of your Grand Master Plan. You can interpret this as a weakness, because you not only have your opponent to deal with, but also the admittedly hard game mechanics which, at times, seem to delight in making things really hard for you. This is an issue you should not underestimate: putting this game on the table 'just to see what it is like' is a clear mistake. Players will wonder what happened to their brains, and noone will have a proper idea how to go about making things happen in a way they envisage. But playing more often, gaining experience as you go, is definitely rewarded. It becomes less of a fight against the mechanics and more of 'going with the flow'. As beginner you simply don't fully comprehend their scope yet. Every time you play you learn a little more, meaning that this is a title you won't soon tire of. Even when I need to consider the rather painful fact that my most common opponent is my girlfriend who is an absolutely ruthless player who beats the living daylights out of me, and delights in making things really, REALLY hard for me.

This game is not for wussies: you need to [i]think[/i] here. But if that is not a problem, go for it. Clear rules, beautiful graphics in whatever version, and a depth and uniqueness in gameplay to put any regular boardgame to shame. It is sometimes compared to Euphrat & Tigris, but the comparison only goes so far. Knizias title is more incremental, whereas Reef Encounter is ... well, circular. Or perhaps wavy, if that makes any sense. Reef Encounter is by far the best of Richard Breese's designs to date as well one of the best boardgames I have ever played&mdash;my sincere compliments to him.

RATING: 6.5
What looks like a pretty little game is actually a multi-layered abstract strategy challenge.  Players are trying to manipulate growing coral to maximize the opportunity to eat it, while balancing the imposition of other players and keeping an eye one which type of coral dominates in that area.

On the plus side, I like the idea, the components and the depth.  But I felt like there is a lot of struggling for very small net gains, and downtime between turns is a real issue.

For a light-confrontation game, I think I'd prefer Tigris & Euphrates - but still would play this one again if offered in the future.

Production: Stunning.  Each tile appears to be unique, despite how similar it looks to others of the same type.  The Shrimp are a very creative shape.  The artwork is a very subdued, tropical blue.  Play: It's fun expanding one's coral, and it's always satisfying picking a lot of tiles at the end of one's turn.  The only real tricky part is trying to manage the face-up, this-eats-this tiles, which is time consuming and thus creates a lot of downtime for out-of-turn players.  (3+1+3) (1 play)

This one is difficult for me to rate after just one play.  I like the tile laying aspect of the game and the assimilation mechanism (where corals can take over other spaces) feels somewhat consistent with the theme.  I'm not sure I like the changing values for different colored tiles and all the thinking that has to happen on that side of things.  I like it enough to try it again, but I'm taking it off my want list for now until I've had the chance to play it at least once more.

Lots of opportunity for clever play.  Has a kind of puzzle quality that I like, and really forces you to think on your feet.  It also requires some "thinking outside the box" -- sometimes it's best to overrun your own coral, to get "consumed tiles", and even expand an opponent's coral to get that one polyp tile you need.  Lots of fun.  And the play time is coming down, too.  I've now seen 3 player games in about 2 hours, which is about the max for a game to see regular play.

Very interesting combination of tile collection and placement (which gives a vague reminder of Tigris & Euphrates) with value speculation and manipulation.

The game is much harder to play than it looks. It may be compared to Euphrates & Tigris because the mechanics have something in common and it has the same 'what am I doing ?' feeling at first. The rules are also hard to comprehend or explain, but it only gets better and better with further playings.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A classic. I haven't been this excited about a new game since first being exposed to Tigris. After over half a dozen plays, innovative moves and strategies are still being revealed. Loses half a point only because the extremely creative moves (that can take a while to think through) can significantly change the board between turns, resulting in players having to re-think their planning when it comes to their turn. This downtime is only a minor flaw in what I consider a masterpiece, though others I know consider it a greater problem.
Another flaw is that many people don't "get it" or like it, which makes it difficult to find opponents.

Played with my gaming group.  We're experienced Euro gamers and this is by far my least favorite we've ever played for one simple reason:  There is WAY too much downtime between turns in a 4 player game.  There is ZERO player interaction and nothing to do while your opponents are taking their turn because one change on the board can change your entire plan, so you can't really plan ahead.  Seems like I did nothing for 2 hours and all of a sudden the game ended.  Good thing the March Madness basketball tournament was on so I could watch that while we played.  We may try again with a 1 minute timer per turn.

Players, oftentimes, have to plan what they will do at the end of their turn, and into the next turn, before deciding what to do for the current turn. I like the cannibalism aspect very much, where you have to consume your own coral to feed a better alternative. The game feels very different than the average game and the mechanics are innovative. The theme is not one that I would immediately latch onto, but the game itself makes up for that. Nice artwork, but the white and grey tiles are hard to distinguish.

Playing time is now down to 45 minutes and I'm really enjoying it. The mechanics are deceptively simple, the components are beautiful and the various strategies intriguing. I particularly like the variable pacing for the end of game and decisions on when to eat polyps and when to use those eaten polyps. (Victory in my last game hinged on a player eating his own coral!) Very good game.

I have only played this game once but I definitely want to play it again.  It is very interesting and I like the balance of strategy and politics.  My only negative is that aspects of the game seem a bit abstract which makes it difficult to first wrap your head around what is going on in the game.  It seems very similar to T&E on that account.

RATING: 9
It's not that complex a game but the rule book makes it a struggle to get into - not entirely sure why - possibly it's just the non-intuitive role the pieces play, e.g. what is an 'algae cylinder', or the role of a larva cube? 

Once you get past this you have a great game - a proper boardgame with placement considerations and some deep strategy and tactics.

The artwork and production of the original edition just pips that of the newer Z-Man edition.

This is a tentative rating based on one playing. It may go slightly up or down. I really enjoyed it and would gladly play it again. However there was quite a bit of down time as the repercussions of some actions takes some thinking through. There was also a tendency in the one game I played for people to play on separate boards which limited the interaction somewhat.

RATING: 2
There are some neat ideas in this, and there is about 20 minutes of fun in the multi-hour slog.  But the basic structure of the game sets it apart as being less fun than oral surgery.  Most games (wait, lemme check... okay, every game I have) progress towards an ending.  I don't mean just being linear, but there is an end condition that the game is going towards.  This game is structured to head towards a reset.  Over and over.  Every time a coral gets eaten, the board is opened up again.  Imagine playing Go, but whenever you block out a section of territory, you sweep off all the involved stones, score some points, and keep going.  That's what this is like.  It is like playing 12 sequential (admittedly clever) games nonstop.  This could be a great game if that base structure was changed.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Interesting game that kind of reminds me of cross between Tigris&Euphrates and Mykerinos.  You are building up coral reefs, trying to balance decisions on whether to expand them further (for more potential points), or "eat them" for immediate points.  There are some good tactics to it as your "shrimp" are used to defend your coral from invading coral.  I like the mechanics quite a bit.  On the negative, there are a lot of different terms (for components) that you have to get your head around before a game explanation makes sense.  Luckily, the theme works well so that helps.

RATING: 5
Players nuture their own coral on a reef in the hope they get to eat it!  A tile placement/conflict game that is very reminiscent of Euphrat & Tigris.  Players seed the reef boards with a coral cube, allowing polyp tiles to be spread out over the reef, gobbling up neighbouring coral, and protected by shrimp.  If your coral becomes large enough, it can be eaten by your fish, with excess tiles being tossed into your "fish" cup for points at the end of the game.  Additional rules for flip-flopping the dominance of coral with respect to each other, which figures strongly in the final points tally (stronger coral worth more).  Lots to think about, and a pretty good game.  Seems to lack the elegance of Euphrat & Tigris though.

This game is too abstract for my tastes.  The theme just does not work for me.  If you love abstracts you will probably really dig this game.  Solid mechanics, but I am not craving another play.

I didn't get this one at all. Maybe I'm just not smart enough for this game as the planning is so multi-layered that it seems only Einstein could plan ahead enough to be immune to the chaos. My head hurt aftewards.

Pretty fascinating strategy game.  Its ruleset, though it seems cumbersome at first, is actually quite simple, but it belies the depth of strategy available in this game.  Reef Encounter is all about speculation and precise timing.  In many ways, it is an economic speculation game masquerading as a cute undersea diorama.  If you're not thinking a few turns ahead, you're already dead.

Argh, our group's first play took far too long. This is a brain-burner prone to analysis paralysis. The game ended because I chose to end the game (even though I was in a losing position) basically to end the suffering. The Z-Man edition is attractive, but the theme is just pasted on. (And for the record, I don't like Tigris & Euphrates, either.)

This is an interesting tile laying game.  The shrimples are awesome!  Strategy is tough because you have to be tactical on the board and manage your resources which are: tiles in front of your screen, tiles behind your screen, and cubes.  Most of these resources have dual functions as well.  On the board you will be trying to make clumps of similar polyp tiles and protect them with your shrimp.  The polyp tiles have a hierarchy of which colored polyp tiles are dominant over another type.  Things get tricky as you can change the hierarchy and also lock aspects of the hierarchy in place which helps with end game scoring.  It's a very thoughtful but easy for players to lose themselves in analysis paralysis, so it might be better to play with a low player count to reduce downtime.  I think the biggest caveat is that there is a luck of the draw element with starting tiles/what tiles end up with what cubes and a lot of chaos regarding which tiles are taken with cubes.  In the end it's interesting but dry... kinda funny given the theme.

RATING: 7
Interesting tile conquering game by Richard Breese, strangely reminiscent of "Euphrates and Tigris", but interesting in it's own right. The rules and options are VERY confusing at first, so it might turn some first time players off. But it comes together in the game, which plays rather tense...

As with Chess, this is a game I respect but simply don't enjoy playing that much.  The amount of mental exertion required to play Reef Encounter well results in an unacceptable level of fun.

This fast changing tile laying/area control/influence/about five other well-integrated mechanics was a strongly designed game, it's not for me.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The gameplay is very interesting and also very smooth.  The mechanics all interlock very well giving a lot to think about but no impression of clunkiness.  It's really well designed, and seems very deep (more plays will tell for sure).

As an added bonus, the components are beautiful and the theme is very enjoyable (and the mechanics fit the theme very well.  

Note however that I would not want to play this with more than 2 players, both because of the downtime and the loss of control.  But with 2 players this is a brilliant game.  My only fear is that it will be too long for us to get it onto the table very much.

One other minor complaint is the randomness in which tiles are available; I generally prefer no-luck games.  But because there are five options to draft from, this does not feel too restrictive - much better than the random tile draw in Tigris&Euphrates, which I find very annoying.  Here the randomness elements are minor enough to not bother me too much.  

1/8/2013 - With a dozen 2-player plays under our belt, I've upgraded this to a "9".  It seems like every game we discover a new strategy.  And the gameplay is so smooth and satisfying - I love it!

After a number more plays this has lost of a little bit of it's shine. Now it feels more like just a set-collection game, which of course at its heart it is, and the randomness bothers me a bit more.  Still a good game though.

RATING: 6
A game that lives up to its reputation of being a very clever game which lends itself to AP. I'll probably never be very good at a spatial game like this, but I actually enjoyed my play of it and would play again. 

You're trying to put down groups of tiles and score them, but you can't let them be taken over before you do. The tiles follow a hierarchy of which tiles are dominant to which other ones. However, the trick of the game is that the hierarchies can be changed and locked in. So you play with one eye on the board and another on the hierarchies. Requires deliberate, thinky play with room for clever offensive and defensive moves. 

Not a lot of talking during this one. Played online and we had to see if people had gotten disconnected or fallen asleep.

Played 1 time with 3 players. I wanted to like this -- I mean REALLY wanted to like this -- but I couldn't do it. Despite its whimsical theme and beautiful graphics, this game was dry as a bone in the Arizona desert. It felt like a Knizia game from the late 90's like T&E (which explains why so many other people like it, and why I dislike it so much.) Can I admit that it is brilliant design? Absolutely! The mechanics are unbelievably well integrated with each other, and the game is finely tuned. I would even go as far as saying the coral theme is well-suited for the game, but the mechanics of the game are so finely balanced and well-tuned that they are the only thing I notice when I played this game. I found much about this game to appreciate on a technical level, but nothing about it to enjoy except the Shrimple and the artwork.

Intricate, deep and completely engaging.  It's so easy to lose track of all that is going on because you are constantly trying to build up your position while keeping the others at bay.  Much of the actions revolves around enlarging your coral reef, but to make sure that what you are doing will be worthwhile, you have to monitor the value of the corals you consumed.  Excellent game in so many ways and one which may eventually become a 10 once I figure out a way of not shooting myself in the foot with all those algae cylinders, coral cubes and polyp tiles...

After one play, I like this game a lot. It's got enough of a brain burne element to intrigue me, but not so much I get frustrated.

More plays are needed to understand the game better, but it's worth trying.

People always mess with your stuff!  The kind of game you keep thinking about...  I can't wait to get it to the table again.

Some fun spacial and logistical elements, but at its heart, it's a commodity speculation/manipulation game.  Very nice interaction among the players there with fun choices between going for quantity or quality.   I've seen games won where people just chow on as many tiles as possible and games won where people only ever ate a single color.  Some will probably disdain the lack of control in tile choice, but the game isn't that long.  Making the best of what you and others have is the fun of the game.

RATING: 4
[Abstract Strategy, Resource Management, Set Collection, Planning] (R&D Edition) [4P:4] Whoever said this game had anything in common with E&T is simply wrong. Other than placing square tiles, they are nothing alike in gameplay and in character. The timing of RE is uninteresting, and like many indy games it could have used more cleaning up and streamlining to make it play better. The clunkiness of trading consumed polyps for polyp cubes or alga cylinders and polyp cubes for polyp tiles is extremely clunky. The sizable player turns wreck whatever momentum the game has. Finally, the theme does not work at all. Who are the players? How do they control a fish, some shrimp and the growth of corals? Are they sea gods? Neptune? Poseidon? Habbakuk? I find no joy in this game. Removed from wishlist. *** UPDATE: Confirming the problems with Reef Encounter. When players aren't just taking cubes and tiles, they're constructing large turns in their heads. The board is totally static in the early game with the shrimp shutting down board activity, and people jumping through hoops to generate consumed polyps, which is just tremendously boring. All of that just to create a resource? Why? I also am hugely perplexed by the ascendancy tiles. This mechanism added a significant fiddliness to the proceedings without adding any real value to the gameplay. So you have to have the thing on the right side to "attack", and you can also have it on a certain side to score more. Because those color corals are more dominant? And this can change after the fact (post digestion by the fish)? Oooookay. And perhaps worst of all, the timing and rhythm of the game is abysmal. It's a struggle for the players to keep their minds on the game. RE is one of the bigger game disappointments in terms of my anticipation to actual experience comparison. I have a feeling that RE could have been improved with a lot more development to file down the many rough edges in its design. Too bad.

******* Recommended by my Geekbuddies: 11 ratings, 7.91 Average Rating. Well, now that Z-Man is going to reprint Reef Encounter, and given my satisfaction with their handling of Santiago, I can safely put this on my To Buy List. However, it had better not cost $100!

One of the most original designs I know, and perhaps my all-time favorite.  
Excellent as a strategic two-player game; slightly more chaotic but still huge fun with more players.  The biological nomenclature in the rules may make them seem more complicated than necessary, but they are not so poorly written as many claim.  In any case, gameplay is well worth the effort.  Excellent, well-integrated theme.  I find it less  of a brain-burner (and less abstract) than E&T.

This game reminds me of the same thought processes that make me like T&E, but with much more interesting mechanics and gameplay, in my opinion of course.  I like it best with three, but there is more control with two.  Four is fun, just don't expect to plan too far ahead (or for your turn to come around quick at all).

Reef Encounter is a tough clam to crack. The innocent, cutesy theme hides a pretty intense knife fight on the ocean floor. Direct conflict, resource management, and timing issues are the components which, looking at them in isolation, are fairly easy to grasp. In combination, however, they prove quite challenging. The final outcome of a game of Reef Encounter seems to be the result of a flock of butterflies flapping their wings (or maybe I should say jellyfish swaying their tentacles in order to not destroy the imagery). How to get them to sway in a way that benefits you is not something that is immediately apparent after the first play. An opaque and highly unusual game.

I haven't played [thing=42][/thing], so I cannot compare, but it is a pretty nice heavy heavy tile laying game.

The rulebook is a mess, so it is just a bit difficult to teach (and learn) though, so I recommend reading the revised rules on BGG.

But once you get past the learning curve, it is a blast!

RATING: 9
Received 12/13/04. Played first game on 12/16/04. Have now played ten games and like it better with each play. After the first play, all four players wanted to play it again. Certainly a brain-burner, and the first game was about 1/2 done before we quit having to reference the rule book. Not one that is simple to teach/learn. But it plays far more easily than it is to learn. A bit of down-time if you play with the analytical. My third play was with 2 players and it was just as enjoyable IMO. Fourth and fifth play was with 3. So far, I see little difference re: number of players. Just as fun, no matter how many play.
Second play required only a couple of minutes of review and it all came back. Played a bit quicker and was a lot of fun. It may be an illusion, but it seems that there's a lot more depth than I'm currently seeing in this one. 
Fourth play was very quick! Around 45 minutes. We all three had played before and there was little down time. But most of my games involve at least one person who has never played the game, slowing it a bit.

Yes! It turns out Reef Encounter is quite a good game. Solid mechanics and a theme that you won't find anywhere else, which is so refreshing. Some rule peculiarities here and there (necessary, but add convolution). It takes a bit to figure out how everything fits together, but once you do, it is clear that there is a strong system at play here. A relatively straight-forward game to play but a brain burner for sure. Trying to play this briskly means strategic mistakes will be made. Each turn requires thought for optimal play. I think I would like this as a 3-player game, but 4-players was perfectly workable (except for turn wait and less control over what is going on). A nice, mid-weight game.

Awesome, if abstract and hard to learn, game of coral survival. I think the game mechanics are innovative and true to the theme (fixing algae change coral "dominance" etc.). Too bad the rules aren't easy to explain, and the game seems to induce AP easily, so it's not easy for me to get friends around the table for this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Although with other games I have played very little of and rated, Reef Encounter for me asks to be withheld from any attempt at early judgement.  My early playings have been with less than enthusiastic partners so in a way has stunted any real attempt at garnering a real feel for this Breese title.  Having spent so much of my like in tropical environments the theme is naturally attractive.  The rules set seem to paint a unique gaming experience which offers a hearty challenge, yet, when suggested this title is met with indifference or groans.  Here I thought wooden shrimp would provide for an eagerness to discover what lies within this cardboard box, but instead have only seemed to scare people off with an idea of a game being to deeply abstract.  what to do?  Any interested players out there in South Florida?

Update: it's a brain burner, and the components are beautiful, I just think I am more compelled to play other games.

Outstanding Game!  My rating is for 2 players only... I have not played it with more.

Hmmm...
Rating after 20 plays at spielbyweb.com

To be interesting and engaging - this must be played by plaers with equal experience. If not, becomes quite repetetive.
There are always a few turns to collect resources. Thus not very dynamic.
With 4 it's a little too chaotic. I can't manage all boards at once. With 3 this's very good game. But as with 2 must be played by players with equal experience.
The (bad) luck of the draw of the tiles at the beginning of the game could be very frustrating.
Most brainburning game I've ever played. Can't be played intuitivly. You have to calculate a lot.

EDIT - 05.2011
Damn. I don't know what to think. Game's good BUT - the downtime when you want to calculate most best move is horrible. There's not much you can think in the turn of the player on your left (in 3 p. game). The game's also much less dynamic than T&E. I mean - MUCH less. Ok, board changes but two well-situated shrimps in a corner is the only idea that really, really works. Maybe it's because of the unexperienced company, maybe I was a bit tired. Will check with 2 and once again with 3. If nothing changes - I will stick with the SpielbyWeb version only.
---
EDIT - 06.2011
After - totally - 30 plays at SpielByWeb and 3 in real. This one burned out a bit for me. Too static, too defensive, too random (draw of the tiles+cubes), too long with new players (and with them too much of kingmaking). It's not like the game's totally bad. It's still one of the best, but I can't see anything new anymore here for me. Additionally - due to my online experience - I'm usually bored with real players or see them making obvious moves. I'd much rather play Caylus or Tigris&Euphrates. Maybe - unobtainable in polish shops - expansion would change my mind. This way - I'll rather stuck with playing RE online, only.
Nevertheless, thank you, Chris Burm, for my real first love in bordgaming hobby - the Reef Encounter. :)
And for those reading my longish comment: don't hesitate to aks me for a game online, I'll never turn back a game this way.

Sold.

I decided to record all my games of Amun-Re, Tikal and Reef Enc. on SpielbyWeb here on the geek. These games are much more pleasent played by web than face to face (unfortunately).

RATING: 8
My first game, with 4 players, was ridiculously long.  It took over 3 hours to teach and play.  However, by the end, we were playing quickly.  Definitely playable in under 90 minutes with experienced players.  We all waited too long to consume coral, as we didn't yet understand the strategy involved.  It's a beautiful game to look at, has a very fun theme, and has come as close to a perfect theme-mechanics connection as I've seen. 

With 2 players, it becomes a quick one.  I can see this playable in 30 - 45 minutes with 2 players.  It loses some angst, but becomes a good race to consume four times first.   

My rating for this game has climbed the last two times played.  I love it so much as a 2 player game, I'm almost scared to play it with 3 or 4.

This is probably the only game I've ever regretted trading away or selling.  I miss it!

There's a lot of game here but its long on the thinky and short of the fun.  I don't like the scoring mechanism - four bites sums up how the score will come about, and all that other stuff determines what the values will be for the tiles eaten by the ravenous parrot fish.  The Z Man edition has color issues - big time.  My colorblind wife had fits over the pink and orange tiles, and the salmon larva cubes that are supposed to be pink and are way too close to the orange - awful.

Interesting to be able to change values of the different corals.  Fun challenge to get the largest coral reef while only being able to protect a few of them.  Would prefer the "won" coral pieces for each player to be open information so that the game doesn't devolve into a memory contest.  Seems like it needs another layer to it to be a more interesting experience.

Clever game, enjoyable to play and pretty to look at. The mechanics are very strong with supremacy of colours changing as players needs alter and reefs being abandoned for better goals.

However, the rules are terribly written, I do recommend getting a guide on here. Even still it is not an easy game to get players into, but if they survive the first play they will certainly come back for more. Hence the lower score I've given this game.

I've come to realize that playing this without the player screens and hidden parrotfish makes it a very obvious game. And if keeping these trackables hidden is the only way to make the game interesting, what does that say about the design? Still, it's good, even played open.

Great bits backed up by a wonderful game. It took a couple reads through the manual for the game process to gel in my head, but it works cleanly once you get it. 

Playing with two players, the coral strength area of the open-sea board didn't seem to be very useful. There were a few consumed polyps, but not so much interaction that required giving it much thought. But maybe it was a fluke of which polyps were available during the game?

Anyways, makes me interested to check out some more of Breese's titles.

I don't like how the person who triggers the game end is at a disadvantage because his opponents (especially the player to his right) get to score coral fields that never get attacked at only one point less than those scored during the game. This gives everyone incentive not to be the person who ends the game, and therefore the game drags on after it has worn out its welcome, turning into a game of chicken.

I like most of the other parts of the game, and may try tweaking it at some point.

2006 acquisition.  Rating currently based on a single 2-player game.  This is by far the most complicated game my wife and I has played together.  The theme, being less of building cities and empires, appeals to her (update:  she doesn't like direct confrontation!).  The rule is very difficult to digest but Board Games with Scott has a fantastic explanation of the rules.

I like the fact that there are a lot of things to consider each turn and it tickles my brain a nice way.

3-player only (for us).

Alterations/House rules: We use the updated rule of not taking possession of a cube with action 7(?).I'm almost through with those screens. Some people keep them to hide the initial tile draw and nothing else, but once the secret scoring tile has been dropped in the parrot fish, I'm not sure why I would want them at all. I'll find sticks to separate the "consumed" tiles from the ordinary.

Touchstones: Harvest quickly in order to get to the stock market before others; Creative destruction

RATING: 6
Very clever and elaborate design with an original theme and excellent art (Z-man edition). There are lots of choices and elements to consider, but also chaos and a strong potential for kingmaking. Unfortunately, given that a single action can alter the value of several coral colors at once, huge swings of points may happen in the endgame. For a long and cerebral game like this, that can be very frustrating.

RATING: 7
Deep game that is difficult to learn.  A real brain burner.  The cyclical nature of the actions is somewhat unique.  While I enjoyed this one, I've found that my general gaming group did not, therefore it is most likely destined for the trade pile.

It's awfully clever, but the necessity of having both cubes and tiles of an advantageous colour just strikes me as too limiting--and it also makes the game rather too tactical. I think the game has one too many mechanisms for its own good. Still rather fun, though.

Reef Encounter is a game that allows for nuanced play, tactical decisions and (from what I gather), replayability. It is also the type of game that I dislike. The theme is entirely pasted on. And is boring to boot. I typically dislike games where you are drafting different colored cubes and chits and then try min/max what you draft. I don't find this fun. :(

Beautiful, beautiful game which is incredibly brain-burning. It is not an easy to grasp game even if the moves available to you are simplistic enough - this is more the type of game that reveals itself to you as you peel away its layers like a sweet sweet onion (that makes you cry in a hurt-so-good manner).

Update August 2015

This game *really* shines with a table full of players who really push each other. I'm all-the-more amazed by how well it holds up to repeated plays. This game is [i]deep[/i] (no pun intended) for the structure that it lays out. Not an *easy* game (that can be picked up and played), but certainly one that rewards multiple plays.

This is just an excellent game, and really a bit of a brain-burner for me. Each turn presents you with many options and tough decisions. I love the give and take of having to weaken your fortified positions in order to score them, which opens new opportunities for other players. It definitely takes a bit of nuance to know just when is the right time to consume one of your corals or to lock down a tile. There is an awfully lot of information to track, especially with four players. I find the Z-Man edition quite beautiful.

'Brain-burner' is an over-used phrase which this game certainly earns.  Breese has created a tile-laying game with lots of complicated angles, area-control/activation issues, and the setup and timing of limited scoring opportunities.

The basic units of economy, the polyp tile and the larva cube, are what drive and allow all this to occur, and they also form the basic scoring unit, with values determined by relative strength and locked in place by alga cylinders.

There are ten basic actions, some of which are repeatable, others not, but which are all available during each player turn.

The interplay of tiles taken, area-control and continuing acquisition of activation/control tokens, never minding guiding the scoring the way you want it are what make this a fascinating game.

I am starting this at a 7 on one play; I'm sure I haven't a terrific notion of how to play this after only one game, but I do know I like it and want to try it again, soon.

This is a brain-burner, and not for the faint of heart. The mechanics are utterly confusing, and you may as well resign your first game to being a learning experience. It will take several plays to "understand" the flow of this game. Despite being given 10 different actions, most turns players are limited to executing 1 or 2 plays. Most of the time players are collecting items for the big play afterwards. The confusion arises from trying to visualize how these 10 different actions string together to yield you victory points. You could take a basic approach by simply collecting and growing your patches of coral. However, it is counter-intuitive to consume one of your own coral to get the all-important consumed polyp tiles, which greatly opens up your play options.

The game seems to combine a number of mechanics together for an intense game of area-control and resource collection. The area-control is reminiscent of Tigris & Euphrates, which hints of Oasis, while the resource collection is just like Le Havre. The novelty is that there is a dynamic coral hierarchy that determines what types of polyps 'dominate' other types, and thus allow consumption (aka attacks) of coral from other players or from your own.

The rules are terribly written, with confusing game terminology. It talks about things like algae cylinders and open-sea areas, but does not point to what they are, or where they are on the board. Thus, players not familiar with this game will be somewhat lost with the rules. Once the rules are understood, the game play is relatively fast. However, the strategy continues to be fascinatingly deep, with layers of tactics in between. Does not make a good gateway game, and is not something that can be quickly taught to newbies--rules took 30-45 minutes to explain. 4P play took 90 minutes. It's worth the investment, but without a veteran's guiding hand, this could easily frustrate and turn-off newcomers.

A really neat area control, set collection? game. What really makes the game is the speculation bit with the coral domination tiles. It almost - almost - doesn't matter how many polyps of a coral your parrotfish consumes. As long as you end the game with those corals being dominant, you can get tons of points.

Seemed extremely random for how long it was.

The theme was pretty interesting. Or novel, at least. But it also felt like one of those games where you need to play it a couple of times become competent, understand how the cards and mutations interact best and so on.

Even with a dedicated gaming group to get past those hurdles I have a hard time seeing this be the kind of game that would grab me. My preference is for shorter games with lower luck so this has two strikes against it straight away.

RATING: 9
Although I now own a physical (signed!) copy of this game, I have still played most of my games of this online at Spiel by Web, and I would say that it is perfectly suited to online play because each turn is meaty.  The first few games can really bog you down with AP, leaving your more decisive opponents in "downtime" while you try to understand the influence you have over the dynamic interaction of different corals.

I look forward to giving it more plays in the future.  In particular, I would like to answer the following question: which do I prefer, Reef Encounter or Tigris and Euphrates?  In the mean time, take the fact that I am even considering this question as an indicator of how good Reef Encounter is.

Note: I read/heard on a blog somewhere someone asking "why do people always compare this to T&E?  It shares more in common with Imperial".  This is a question, with a a very obvious answer: RE and T&E are excellent tile laying games!  However, the point is totally valid: mechanically there is a strong parallel between Imperial and Reef Encounter because both have a layer on top of the area-based play which can be manipulated and which affects the value of your final position.  Still, they are vastly different games, and I recommend Reef Encounter to anyone who enjoys meaty Euros.

El primer Eurogame con estilo druídico. Una mezcla inteligente entre un juego económico con acciones de compañías y un wargame táctico. Te gustará si te va resolver puzzles y emplear tu pensamiento analítico por encima de las risas y la conversación desenfadada durante una partida. De los pocos eurogames que funcionan a 2 jugadores. Más estratégico que táctico, compensan más las decisiones a largo plazo que aprovechar oportunidades. Algunos lo han comparado con Tigris y Euphrates... pero sólo porque ambos comparten alguna mecánica de Aquire. Buena idea la de "camarones limitados por jugador" (impide que el primer jugador lleve ventaja) y la interacción con las algas (varían el valor de los pólipos). PEGAS: Hay que anticipar de 4 a 5 jugadas para hacerlo bien lo que ocasiona elevado A/P, reglas difíciles de explicar y elevada curva de aprendizaje. Muy abstracto y tema poco atractivo.Repetitivo.

The first time i wanted to play it, we couldn't even get through the game rules. It was all a bit confusing and the game ended up in the closet. But we gave it another try 2 weeks ago and told ourself that we would try the game 3 times! The first time was, again, terrible. The second time it was much better and the last time we realy got the hang of it. It turns out te be a great game where you need to pay a lot of attention to a lot of factors. Its a game where you realy have to think over what you wanne do. Till now we only play with 2 and i liked it very much.

Reef Encounter is one of the most original - or perhaps "least derivative" is more accurate - German-style games I have played in a long time (or so it seems after a couple of plays). At first it is difficult to know how to tackle the game, although careful placing of polyp tiles and shrimps is clearly a good idea as it helps to protect your corals from attack. The game is relatively lengthy, but does not outstay its welcome as there are tactical considerations to dwell upon every turn. The most innovative mechanic is the use of coral tiles to determine the relative strength of corals during the game AND to determine the score per polyp tile at the end of the game.

After a second playing of this game, I enjoyed it more.  So long as you are aware that the game is going to be decided by the final tile flips, you can orient your strategy to compensate.  The reason this works is that initial coral fields are not terribly static, and you can sway colors by eating your own fields particularly in the end game where you are likely to have larger coral stacks in reserve.

RATING: 8.5
The game CAN be learned from the rulebook but seems unintuitive in many ways.  All in all, I enjoyed the game and would love to play more often to better understand the strategy involved.  It is too early in my experience to rate it much higher at this point.

The Z-man components are beautiful and work very well.  The grey/white color problem of the original edition was fixed when the colors were redone.  

UPDATE: Bumped up a point after 5 playings.  There is a lot going on here and it gets better the more I play.

Area control:tile laying:market manipulation:set collection:

An extremely well themed game that is very analytical so more of a 'gamer's game'. Can be a little tricky to learn but it flows nicely once it gets going.

Funny for a well themed game the play is almost dry as the table is quite quiet with everyone doing their own analysis, that is until the screwage effect kicks in. It is prone to AP but with 3 players you have just enough time to plan and calculate before it is your turn, albeit someone's move may change your plan so flexibility is required. 

There is a relation to T&E here as when coral is growing and attacking it is similiar to Kingdoms in T&E. I do think this feels just a little more analytical and T&E feels just a little more dynamic. The 'market' that is present in this title however makes this a very different game and it is one of the keys to winning as well. 

Timing is the big critical aspect in this game; when to lay down your tiles or hold out to put down more, when to attack a neighboring coral, when to gobble up your coral or push your luck to gobble up more, when to flip over tiles in the market which can help attacking and when to lock them down for points at the end.  

A nice mix of strategic and tactical thinking, I think 3 is the sweet spot for this, more downtime and chaos with 4 and not as much competition with 2 but very scalable all the same and I can see where there might be much more control with only 2 (again like T&E here IMO).

What a fantantic game! I'm so glad they reprinted this. There is a chance of overanalysis and some may see the inability to plan very far ahead as a downside, but it's what kept me on the edge the whole game.

**UPDATE** The game has lost it's luster a bit and I haven't played it live or online in quite some time now. Dropped the rated from a 9 to an 8.

**UPDATE** Dropped the rating to a 7.5. No one asks for this game anymore and I have little desire to pull it out myself.  It's a good game that just wore out it's welcome though I still can't bear to trade/sell it yet.

Played with both two players and four players. I like the amount of choices the game forces you to make. The cube/tile selection you're faced with at the end of each turn is painful to make since there's usually no perfect group to take. I have noticed that if players don't keep up with the leader (in terms of eating shrimp), they can be left so far behind that they have no hope of winning. That makes this game even more interesting since you have to actively play to keep up with your opponents.

Definitely one that I want to play again.  My friend thought it was a lot of fun.  As did I.  Unfortunately, our wives had a miserable time.  They didn't get it, nor did they really want to.  Both are highly intelligent, but this game turned out to be abstract enough that their eyes just glazed over.

enorm veel keuzes te maken.
Strategie loont, maar je moet ook tactisch ingrijpen. Wel moeilijk uit te leggen aan nieuwe spelers. Het duurt een spel voor je het echt begrijpt, en de mogelijkheden zien.
Opgelet, omdat dit spel nogal visueel is, zijn er mensen die de mogelijke strategische keuzes niet zien. Niet voor iedereen dus.

This game has some convoluted rules and I have to ding it for that. Also in a 3 player game, it suffers from the classic 3 player balance issues. Either, 2 of the 3 players fight and the third player wins easily or 1 player gets attacked by both other players and has no chance of winning.  In my case, two of us fought while the third player managed to score more points that the other two did combined.

Initial impression: Interesting brain-burner marred by a theme so obscure and unintuitive that for alle purposes it makes the game an extremely complex abstract game.

Gameplay seems largely tactical, and it seems like the game has a much too great potential for downtime and AP.

Interaction is direct and aggresive, which is a nice change from most other euros. The game also feels very dynamic and not as "railroaded" as many euros. Again, nice.

However, I haven't really enjoyed RE so far, and would much prefer to play E&T if given the chance.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (October 2012)

What a surprise! Great game. The theme is somewhat boring but the gameplay is excellent. This is my kind of game, a brain burner with very low luck :devil:. The only downside? some people can take a long time thinking (long downtime) so perhaps it is a good idea to play it with only 3 players (or only 2).

The components are ok, the art is pretty but not to my personal liking BUT the mechanics are great. They are easy to teach. You can do 10 different actions each turn so you have a lot to consider. There is market value manipulation, area control, set collection and lots of direct conflict. Thank to this, the game offers a plethora of hard decisions through all the game, each action is important, definitively not a game for newcomers, this is a true gamer´s game.

The designer, Richard Breese, was below my radar but I will begin paying him more attention.

I would have never played this due to the uninteresting theme, but I’m glad a friend introduced it to me.

This game is very hard to master, so I see myself playing it again soon because the game is very deep and I have only beginning to scratch its surface :D

A very good game, but I just don't care for it that much.  Seems like every time I play (10 times or so by now) an opponent chains together 10-12 polyp tiles and I'm left wondering what I possibly could have done to stop it.  The spatial dimension to this game definitely impedes my understanding.

RATING: 8
Wow. I'm smitten with it right now. I really took to it on my first play once I got the actions down. It just clicked for me. 

I've come to realize that I'm much more of Breese fan than I had thought (I have a lot of his games). 

This is a very neat game, lots of systems, scoring manipulation, I love the bits, and I love the timing your future plans...you can even work longer range strategies in amidst some tactical fights. I like that I can plan for my next set of tiles--that may give this game an edge over Tigris and Euphrates in the log run, but I need more plays to see if I stay smitten with it.

It seems like it's going to be tough to play and like the rules are convoluted, but it's got a very cool flow and plays smoothly. I'm really looking forward to the next game.

UPDATE: Some more plays...growing on my list of favorites. You can do so much! You can pull off some incredibly creative moves.

Initial rating.  I enjoyed my first play today, but the learning curve is steep enough that I still will feel new to the game the next time I play.  So, I could either really like it, or not.

The fluid nature of the coral building is both appealing and daunting.  To do it well (i.e. quickly) takes quite a bit of foresight and planning of rather complex mechanics.  This coupled with the overall simplicity of the game presents a pleasing (at least on the first play) paradox.

I was looking forward to playing this game before buying a copy, so when one of our club members brought his copy, I had to play.  I have since played a number of games on SpielByWeb and the results of most of the games has left me a little cold.  The game quickly deteriorates into "if my parrotfish eats a coral each turn and I have a shot at winning... I'll do it."  Eat a coral, use an algae cylinder to lock a tile... repeat until done.

Games just seem to get started and they are over (I've never seen a game go more than 10 or 11 rounds).  No one wants to fall too far behind, so everyone does the same thing over and over again.

Tile draws are critical too... if a triplet becomes available to you, you almost have the game won by taking it.  I like randomness, but this almost breaks the game for me.  There seems to always be a "best move" for each player and no one wants to take risks... at least in all the games I've played so far.

Maybe I just don't "get it"... but judging from the people I've played with, no one else does either.  Scores for every game have been so lopsided, it looked like the last place finisher wasn't even trying.  When everyone is doing their best and if the game is balanced... you would think that you'd never see scores with a 55 point difference, yet it's happened on at least two different occasions.

Because of the apparent balance problems (the starting polyp tiles don't seem to address this at all), Z-Man could have done some re-development on the game before they re-published it, but they didn't.  Playing with the variant rules is a MUST! And restricting Action 1 would be a good addition too... limit Action 1 until round 5 or so or make it so that a player cannot take Action 1 on two consecutive turns.  The objective here is to lengthen the game slightly and make scoring much more tactical.  Removing the score multipliers would help too... make the larvae tiles additive to polyps instead.  Scores would be much closer and game tension would be a lot higher.  Needs a little tweaking... especially with only two or three players.

I finally bought the 2nd edition of the game.  Maybe a little more face to face play will help make some sense out of what is going on... but for now the game only rates a 6.

Based on one play, I was surprised that I actually liked it as I am usually NOT the fan of confrontation games (Tigris and Euphrates, Wongar, etc).  Unfortunately, it is highly prone to AP and there is NOTHING to do during other players' turns.  You can't really plan your next move because the 'eating order' or coral available could easily be gone.  Even with that, I enjoyed my playing and would be willing to give it another couple gos to see if I could do better.

R&D Games edition.  A tactical game of (underwater) resource management and area control.  It appears that, at first glance, a significant amount of end-game control is obtained through establishing a firm 'lock' on various coral tiles by way of placing certain colored algae cylinders earlier (but not too early) in the game.  The 'flipping' nature of these coral tiles causes enough chaos to the ever changing board composition and requires re-evaluating each turn.  The real trick is to manipulate the direction of the game to fit your earlier intensions.  To grow or to eat... if it were only that simple.

There is a lot going on in this game. Developing coral reefs and protecting them with your shrimp until you think they are large enough to consume. Beware your opponents reefs as they will try to eat away at the work you've done. There are quite a few actions that a player can do on his turn. The game ends in one of two ways so players have to be aware of what the end game will be and play accordingly. Very cool game.

Muy buen juego, que personalmente me gusta mucho.

El tema no le hace ningún favor y puede ser un handicap para sacarlo a mesa. A mi el tema me parece de lo más novedoso, y me asombra ver la capacidad del diseñador de crear este juego de un documental.

Juego en el que hay que estar muy atento a lo que hacen los demás y no revelar cuáles son tus intenciones desde el principio, porque tus rivales pueden hacer que todo lo que hayas conseguido no valga casi nada.

A very good game, I like it very much.

The theme it is not its stong point and it can be a handicap for putting it on a  table. In my opinon I think it is sometihing very fresh, I'm fascinated about designer's capacity, who created this game from a TV report.

You have to pay attention to the rest of the players and not to reveal your strategy at the beginning of the game, because your opponents can take profit of it.

Played twice with two players. I thought I understood the meaning of the word 'Brainburner' before, but now I know what it really means. I am looking forward to play again, but will have to be in the right mood. Unfortunately the BGG rating scale doesn't fit my view of this game. It is excellent, so a 9 in that regard, but due to the brainburning qualities I wouldn't want to play it all the time, so a 7. In other words, an 8 on average.

Update: Once you've played a few times it feels less like a brainburner. Excellent game, tempted to up rating to 9.

Second update: Played several times on Spielbyweb.com, but still only twice F2F. Excellent game, in my top ten.

I'm still trying to get a feel for the game and would like to play with more experienced players.

The initial learning curve is a little steep, but once you play a couple rounds it becomes very intuitive.

Traded away - playing on spielbyweb is enough for me.

A dry semi-abstract brain burner. I would liken this game to Java above all else. On a player's turn he/she will try to optimize their position/tile placement on the board, and there are effectively 8 actions to take (although the AP wasn't as bad as I imagined). 

Still you can't do any planning until it comes to your turn, since the board will undoubtedly have changed by then, so be prepared for a slow, heavy game.

After two plays:  Quite interesting mechanics and the rules are pretty easy to understand if you start with the scoring and work backwards.  Nice tension between trying to grow a big coral versus ending the game quickly.

After playing this game again: I think I have determined that I do not like the game. There is too much of a kingmaker element in it. It seems like people were taking turns defending against someone else's big corals. If you go through a whole turn without someone else defending against you, you win. Yes, this is an oversimplification, but that is how the game felt to me.

For me this is the primary example of a game that has been produced without a rules-booklet testing. Unnecessarily complicated rules don't make a bad game, though. At first this feels really complicated with a huge load of choices, but once the parrotfish start their work the choices become almost intuitive. There's a little luck, but it doesn't irritate. After playing the game with every available amount of players I feel this is best suited for 3-players. With four it's about grand maneuvering and planning forward is hard. With two it might be a bit too peaceful and clear.

Maybe you need to sit down with a physical copy before the elements of this game completely click into place. To me it seems like a race, the basic game more so: if you can rush to harvest your last shrimp before anyone else does you're probably doing about as well as you can be. In the advanced game there may be time and occasion to flip a few coral tiles in order to attack a vulnerable coral or make your loot more valuable, but you can't be too sure you're not helping someone else at least as much in the end. Also there's a lot of hidden but trackable information even though there's already a mechanism to make scores uncertain.

The grandpappy of the more complex tile-laying Euro family, Reef Encounter is maybe more fun for me because it fits my brain almost perfectly - I haven't lost all that much since I got the hang of it. But I think there's enough in here to keep anyone busy. There's a stock game, there's some very tactical tile-laying, and any canny player has to think carefully about whether to go for points early or late. 

As far as production values, the rules are pretty awful, and could've been written in four pages instead of twenty. On the other hand, I have to give these guys mad props for putting together a game with no language on the tiles that's still pretty intuitive. I'd like to see more high-end Euro games with Reef Encounter's ultra-evocative design aesthetic.

When I play this, I feel like there is depth and strategy but when I reflect back on each game I've played I feel like that is just an illusion.

Long turns that initially felt chesslike now feel like I am just calculating the predictable results of all my actions.  And then choosing the tiles from sets that are randomly drawn can often help one player and not screw another.

I guess I consider this game good.  It certainly isn't bad and I may even play it from time to time.  It's not even that when I am finished that I have had a miserable time I am just totally unfulfilled and that may be just as bad.

Amazing and strange, but deep strategical tile laying and set collection game. Beautiful components. Complex game mechanism with interlocking elements of which the consumed polyp tiles are crucial. Scoring can be very close and very difficult to predict. I quite like it! Excellent with four players, but also very good with two or three. ***** I have the annoying tendency to become second [... when I don't win ;-)] ***** Preference for the more tactical advanced game rules.

The basic version of this game can move very quickly, especially if one of the players is using the "blitz" strategy, and leave a sort of unsatisfied feeling.  I'd like to try the optional extended version, which unfortunately is not available on Spielbyweb.

A masterpiece. Every time I play it I remember why I rate it a 10. Playing online nearly convinced me to lower my rating, but in person the tension is allowed to build over the entire game. You really feel like you got your gaming fix after a game of RE. 

The learning curve is about 3 games I'd say, so go into it knowing that you'll feel a little lost as to how to play well even after you get the rules.

RATING: N/A
Reef Encounter is about life on a coral reef! Using polyp tiles, players grow different types of corals, which they can protect from being attacked by other corals through judicious placing of their four shrimp counters. To be successful players must consume polyps from neighboring corals in order to acquire the 'consumed' polyp tiles that are the key to the game. The consumed polyp tiles have a myriad of uses (and have a similar effect to the action points in games like Tikal and Java). Most importantly they can be used to flip over or lock the coral tiles, which determine the respective values of the different types of coral at the end of the game.

If you play the advanced rules, the "basic" rules makes a game with way too much luck, I know what they mean by brainburner.  I think it is well done.  The game is probably the prettiest we have.  The shrimples are cute.  The screens are too small, but beautiful.  

It's a little too long and heavy and not enough fun or interest for it to be one of my favorites.  It's a good game, but stressful.  It keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole game because if you make one misstep in tile placement they could eat your whole coral.  And you never know what they have behind their screen.

RATING: 8
Subsequent plays have improved this game from a 7 to an 8. Really enjoy the manipulation of the coral and the scoring/dominance tiles. 

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Beautiful gameboard and pieces.  Definitely a brainburner where AP would easily come into play.  Our first play, those of us playing were a bit overwhelmed by the rulebook and all the information we needed to know, but once we got going, the game flowed well and everything in the rulebook became pretty self evident and apparent.

Played once, and my general feeling was "whatever." 

I really liked the theme and the bits -- kudos to Breese for taking us out of Egypt and Italy for once and down under the sea. 

As for gameplay, though, it just feels like there's too much going on.  I barely understood what was happening throughout the game, and had little desire to play again to find out.

For such a watery game, I have to admit that this one's, uh, dry.

RATING: 8
* Game play:

Nice, original (?) elements: the pattern of dominance between polyps is set during the game by the players. This creates a kind of stock exchange where players invest (use algae) in order to influence the "market".

I get a feel of ebb and flow, and of slow changes, with this game. For instance, when you eat coral, you get victory points; but on the other hand, you're left with fewer tactical possibilities, since you also lose (eat) a shrimp in the process. Or when you use an alga and change the order of dominance among corals, not all "dominance flips" are good for you.

- Game weight:

Game weight being an important criterion for my wife and I, here are some thoughts:

There is a lot to think about, in this game; I like this, as there is no time to get bored. The whole dominance chain is not obvious (10 pairwise dominance tiles) and constantly changes, the geometry of the reef is important, what the parrot fish of your opponents have eaten is important to memorize, etc. Resolving actions is fast, and we spend almost all our time thinking. Yummy!

After playing 4 times, we have not really "got" the game yet. Yet, we do not feel completely lost, and have a lot of tactics and strategies to think about? only to discover later than we have very naive ideas.  However, I often feel like I'm flailing about in water: I don't get a clear picture of the longer term consequences of my actions.  Especially since their is an ebb and flow of dominance, in the game; it feels like you can't gain much in one turn (you can make a big coral, but have to wait for your turn to eat it, and it can be damaged while you're waiting); when you make points by eating coral, you also lose a shrimp, and hence protection for other corals; when you lock a dominance tile, other tiles flip, and this is most of the time not to your full benefit.

The rules are actually not very complex in themselves: they are easy to remember, well summarized in the provided cheat sheet, with details that are easily found in the rule book. They are more complex than Small World's / Samurai, but maybe less complex than those of Race for the Galaxy, and certainly way simpler than those of Commands & Colors: Ancients.

Thus, we enjoyed Reef Encounter since our first game (since the rules are simple enough, it is easy to play with them in our head and imagine tactics and strategies). And we look forward to playing more games, as we feel that there is more to understand and discover.

Our games take 1 hour to 1h30, and we like to take all the time we need for thinking.

Reef sometimes feels a little bit like Go: it is easier to defend corals of the right shape.

Reef Encounter leaves me wonder how Go would fare with my wife and I: it is also abstract, offers a lot to think about, has simpler rules,... Maybe Reef has the advantage of being shorter?

* Theme: The theme is well explained in the rule book, and many of the mechanics are quite thematic: polyp larva float in the open sea, you need a larva to start conquering the reef, killed polyps "contain" algae and larvae (they can be exchanged for these), shrimps protect corals,... Some mechanics are not so thematic, though, as far as I can see: the open see contains (adult) polyps (which you fetch at the end of your turn) that can end up on the reef; you can only take 4 polyps from behind your screen in order to grow them on the reef: why?...

* Rules:

The rule book (Quined Games edition) is fine, but is not as clear as many other rulebooks. It goes deeper and deeper in the details (first level: overview; then quick descriptions, with some key concepts left for the third level [attacks, shrimps, eating,…]). This method does not quickly give a concrete understanding of how the game plays.

Advice: the parts in blue *should not be read at first*: they significantly add to the length of the text, and do not help grasping the rules.

Playing the game is actually quite simple. The thematic introduction helps.

I haven't yet seen anything not covered quite explicitly by the rules.

* Bits: not the highest quality, but very good, still.

Some problems with the bits (I'm nitpicking, as the following to impeded in any way the game play):
- Tiny scratch on one reef board
- One shrimp is one-eyed
- white cubes have traces of dirt/color
- Wooden shrimps: some slightly chipped sides
- The typography in the rule book is a little heavy for my taste, though, with very narrow columns that make reading more difficult.

This is a great game if you enjoy a game with a lot of planning, resource management, and brain-wrangling combos. There is downtime between turns. It has a bit of a learning curve, and it's hard to teach. 

If such things sound good to you, then the game is excellent, ala Tigris & Euphrates. The theme is exceptional, and it fits perfectly, and it's humorous as well. I think it would rank higher if the theme were more appealing to more people, but larva and algae aren't exactly everyone's cup of tea lol.

Tile laying game where you are trying to build up tiles in a color and other players are trying to attack your coral. You can protect with a shrimp.  There is a clever mechanic where scoring tiles can be turned over alternating what is valuable and what is not in the game.  

I liked the game but it is not the best game I have ever played.  I tend to not like Richard Breese Games very much.  I found this ok, Keythredral is awful and Keyflower is acceptable.

A highly rated game that has wonderful 2-player gameplay.
BUT it seems like a medium/heavy abstract; albeit, well-themed.

A view of BookShelfGames video appears to indicate that  game is indeed a medium/heavy game - 3.7 weight (with lots of rules to follow). Either the theme does not seem to jive with me OR the presentation seems to be very un-engaging. Either way, the rating of this game by my students has since dropped from a 2 to a 3; notwithstanding excellent reviews.

Every time I play this I learn something new about it. The large number of possible actions make the game somewhat difficult to explain, and beginners often wonder what to do. However the very nicely done play aids help to keep an oversight. The game has very interesting mechanics, which make for a very exciting gameplay, once you have grasped them.
I'm a bit unsure on how strong the influence of the random tile draws is however.

The more I play the less I like the influence of the tile draws ...

RATING: 7.9
Richard Breese knows how to make unique and original games.  Underneath the surface is an economics/stock manipulation abstract game, vaguely reminiscent of Acquire.  This is disguised by the "theme" of the game.  Personally I don't care much for the look/art/theme, and abstract games are generally not my favorite genre;  However, the uniqueness of the innovative and solid game mechanics of this game make it a pleasant surprise.  Rules are fairly straightforward once you start playing, but they are far from intuitive -- every time I take this game off the shelf I have to reread the rulebook and almost make an effort to relearn the game.  As a result I am unlikely to suggest it on a whim and between the odd rules and uninteresting appearance the game does not get played as often as it could.

RATING: N/A
Beautiful game and so much fun to play - added plus that the theme ties into my other main hobby.  

Tough decisions on when to play a tile color - should I play it now so I don't waste time or should I wait until my opponent grows a weaker color so I can eat part of it?  Also, timing is important in locking in the dominance of the coral tiles.  Tons of decisions each turn - many of them can be agonizing!  You need to think ahead a few turns and then hope your opponents don't screw you over.  You can analyze everything or play by instinct - but either way this is not a light game and will take a few plays to grasp the basic strategies.  Hard to describe the feeling you get when you pull off an amazing move - that's what puts this game over the top for me.  I can't get enough!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Rating may go up if I play again and can actually wrap my head around the thing.  I played one two player game and I took about 20 minutes on my turn just trying to figure out how to make a good move that would benefit me later on and not leave me to vulnerable.  I did figure out 3 turns before the end that I had NO way to win or even progress my position whatsoever - so the fact that I figured that out means that I'm at least grasping it.  For the time being I'd say I'd like to try again, but it's a bit on the "thinky" side for me to suggest it myself.  That could change.

At first blush, the chaos of the food chain tiles is a little much for me.  Otherwise it's a fairly interesting game... with a lot of down time that can't be used in a meaningful way.

After a second play, the downtime is still there, but it is a fairly interesting, if difficult, game.

I can't speak to how this game plays with more than two players, but this is not a good two-player game. It ends up feeling too tit-for-tat on the board and the "area control" on the different color corral is much less interesting. For me, personally, it was also too aggressive. I played through a full game, but I desperately wanted it to end because I was bored.

Games where a slight difference in placement of tile on the board may make a big difference between life and death are generally messy. That is what the game suffers from: either you analyze all the tiny pieces or you lose, Great dominance of micro-strategy opver macro-strategy is as we see baaad.

This is thematic and fun the same way Tigris & Euphrates is. Either you see the game's metaphor and buy it...or you don't. Both positions are completely understandable. I like both games, and for a similar reason--there are opportunities for very clever plays that make the other players say "wow!", then grumble about how they aren't drawing the same tiles to let them make similar plays. :)

+ Reef Encounter of the Second Kind (unplayed)

Rating based on 3 players.

Playing this takes some brainwork! You have to plan ahead, but a good portion of the game is tactical as the board can change greatly between turns. Due to the multiple actions you can take on your turn there is a fair amount of downtime, but I tend to constantly be thinking of what I should do anyway. I would like to play this more, but it's a difficult one to get out and/or teach due to the unique gameplay.

A fun little tile game, though there is nothing especially fantastic about it. The flipping and lcoking of coral eating abilities is an interesting mechanic. However, that the "shrimp" pieces look like male members is quite distracting.

Good game. My wife and I enjoy it but my game group felt it dragged.  We're a pretty analytical group and the downtime between plays was pretty bad.

I love this game so much I want to throw it out the window.  You see, I don't think I'm smart enough to play well...but it's oh so deliciously brain bending.  The downtime is painful but I've only ever played with 2 or 4. Maybe with 3 it would really shine for me.  Don't even attempt it if you're tired...wait until you're ready for a killer experience.

Edit 1: second play. It's hard to get the overview, yet. But I like it: it really makes you think and you really have to build up to a(n) (un)certain moment. Will your opponent take away your coral, or will your opponent end the game, etc.?

This game is fantastic. It really suits my style of play and I love the subtle depth of tactics. The production quality of the game is great. After a few games (most online) I have decided I like 2 and 3-player best, as 4-player tends to be slightly overly luck-driven.

Alright, I'm a sucker for the theme, as pasted on as it may be. I think it stems back to a misspent childhood near the ocean dreaming of being a marine biologist. Regardless, there is a lot going on in this game, but it can be taught in 15-20 minutes or a few rounds of play. Then it will take far longer to get the subtleties. What coral to build, what parts to protect, and most importantly, when to flip and lock the tiles. This one is going to be a timeless keeper with years of replayability! Now, if I can just get more people to love their Shrimp!

Gorgeous bits and very innovative design.  However, sometimes it felt like there was a little too much going on to keep track of.  My feelings about that will probably change with more plays and experience.  Downtime in this game was a huge problem for me.  I can't think of a single other game that created so much analysis paralysis and waiting around for other people to finish their turns.  For this reason, it has been over four years since my first play and I have never gotten anyone to play this with me.  Dropped my rating considerably to reflect this.

Played my first game and I am impressed.  I like Aladdin's Dragons.  I like Keythedral, and now I can add Reef Encounter.  Richard Breese is producing some very excellent games. 

It took a while for everyone to get their head around things.  I expect it will take a few more playings to discover some neat tricks.  A bit of downtime between turns as there is a lot to consider. Our game took 2.5 hrs... even so I can't wait to try this again.

RATING: 3
The game itself is not bad. The mechanics is sort of boosted up from Tigris'. But there are 2 major problems:
1) Theme is totally dumb. It might have worked if there would have been some humour involved. But now it is dumb, dry and totally uninspiring.
2) There are only 5 different colorcubes/tiles and to start white/yellow are way too close to each other and then yellow/pink closeness is next to impossible. There are a lot of different colours but yet designer decides to make totally idiotic choices...

Otherwise 7.5, even 8, but above flaws downgrade this to 5...

RATING: 10
Mechanics are interesting and involved, but the game has a very compressed playing arc. Just when you think the game is about to kick things into high gear, it winds down quickly and its over.



Note: this isn't to say it's a short game. I'm saying that on average you'll have about 8-10 turns to get through the beginning, middle, and end, so the up and down feeling of dramatic tension feels rushed.
The length and "weight" of the game doesn't come from it's playing arc, but from the analysis needed to play each turn.

edit: enjoying it more now. Raised rating.

RATING: 6
First impression only:  Really, really steep learning curve.  Don't try to use the included manual to explain the rules.  Find another instruction doc on BGG, and use the manual for reference only.  Like "Tigris & Euphrates," there is a really interesting game here, but unfortunately, it is buried under a ton of quirky rules and nuance.  With repeated plays, the strategies may surface, but unfortunately, it may be a while before I can get this back on the table with my crew of players.  They were intrigued at first, but eventually exhausted by the weight.We mostly play games to have "fun."  Laughing, kidding, smiling "fun."  Not "OMG,-isn't-that-a-brilliant-game-mechanic" fun.Some games are tough to get at first, but the core play becomes apparent quickly, as you see the players arrive at their "Aha!" moments.  Even if you don't "get it" all right off the bat, you feel that a return trip would yield more revelations and most importantly, more fun.  Unfortunately, RE looks like a "chore" and "tough work" if we ever return to figure things out.

A very deep and strategic game with lots of options. The only luck is the coral draws. Some of the strategy is how to manipulate the other players and the board which is fun and interesting to try to accomplish. Have only played with 2 players, but would like to try with more because I feel like it would add more tension. Only problem is that the game is deep and complicated enough to keep friends and family from wanting to play it. Would also get the expansion if only I were able to find people that would want to play this game more often.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Excellent combination of strategy and tactics game. The ideal heavy 2-player thinker in 90 minutes. I already dislike the 3-player game due to increased AP, and outright avoid playing this with 4 because of the multiplayer chaos in addition to even more AP.
But with just 2, man, is this great. Completely different from any other of the usual Euro-stuff, it will take time for this game to sink in and give away its secrets. the gameplay is fully non-linear, without snowballing and such. short-term tactics are essential to optimize resource security to execute a mid-term plan, after which the long-term strategy takes over as you gear towards ending the game.
All this allows for plenty of screwage, making completely unexpected moves, setting up decoys for your opponent, half-way through change of plans, and many more ideas solely limited by the creativity of the players. The only random elements (starting tiles and open-sea larva-tile combinations) secure replayability whilst avoiding standard opening moves, and are not at all unpleasantly luck-based: Especially the open-sea tiles are placed sequentially, fully allowing players to plan ahead of things and set up their plays. Wonderful.
However, be prepared to play around 10 games before you have a decent grasp on what is going on, and have an idea of the sheer possibilities involved - much more than your average game. The first few games will consist of messing around and simply getting a feel for what the mechanics can do. As such, players are not focussing and this will lengthen the game (150 minutes is not strange). Do however allow yourself to get past that point, and enjoy the utter greatness that is Reef Encounter.

Brain hurts... 
I love this game, you never have the ressources you need to do what you want. I really like how the corals change value/strength throughout the game, what a great concept and neat execution. The tile selection I felt was a little too random and slow for the game (it takes a little too long for the game to "get going"), but that's a minor quibble.

Wow!  A extraordinary game with a ton of depth and super-rich theme.  I have found that it plays best with 3 players (where I would rate this a 9).  With 4 it's a little too chaotic in that you have little control over the end-game scoring.  It works well with 2 but then I find there's just too much open information (which I'm sure some people will appreciate).  The artwork and colours used (in the original edition) are beautiful.  Very impressed.

RATING: 7
Nice strong gamer's game.  On the medium-heavy side; tile-laying with the aim of getting similarly-colored 'reefs' of multiple tiles together -- based on which types of reefs give the biggest benefit at the time.  Fun little theme (tacked on in Euro way, not in AT manner) and good overall gaming experience.

Only played once, but found it really neat, and thought about it quite a while afterwards. Clearly satisfies the "different pathways to victory" criterion. I couldn't keep track of what anyone else was doing, but I think this may have some similarities with Puerto Rico in that tactical play is not as important as it first seems. Although you certainly have to try to anticipate the game end well. Or, you could ask someone who has played more than once. Look forward to trying it with 2.

Reef Encounter is a heavy tile laying/set collection game that has players vying control of various reefs. Players take turns playing “polyp tiles” and changing the landscape of the different reefs all in the effort to feed their Parrot Fish, which counts as points at the end of the game.  

Did I mention this game is heavy? Yes, there are lots of big strategic decisions and some brain burning maneuvering. Also, when playing for the first time, be prepared to wade through the not-so-clearly-written rules. It will be confusing! If you’re still up for the challenge I HIGHLY recommend many of the quick-start guides or rule summaries to help you on your maiden voyage into the reef. With all that said, this game is quite the catch! There are many possible actions a player may take during his/her turn and you must be able to think-out your actions in advance. Highly recommended for hard-core players who like heavy strategic games with lots of tough choices and decisions.

Opaque game. After a single 2-player game, it seems like it would be better with more.

The downtime is a bit of a problem in this brain burning Euro-style game.  Many elements to think about and keep track of, not the least of which is scoring that changes depending on the actions of you and your fellow players.  You might set up for a big move on your next turn, and by the time it rolls around back to you, twenty minutes have passed and the board looks completely different, requiring a lengthy reassessment of the situation.  For those who don't mind this, it's really a quality game, and I personally enjoy it.  But it's tough to find players that really appreciate that sort of game.

RATING: 6
Reef Encounter does share some basic mechanisms with [boardgame=42][/boardgame] (claiming ownership of territory, no tile color is "your" color, consuming four tiles ~ creating a monument), but ultimately these are very different games. Tigris & Euphrates' dramatic, decisive swings are replaced by a subtle investment game; instead of eying a dramatic external conflict to make up ground in a color you're behind in, you'll can devalue that color so you don't need to catch up. Despite enjoying the brain burning aspects of this game, I find it painfully convoluted and unintuitive. While I'm up for the challenge, it's just not as enjoyable as other equally challenging games.

Una partida jugada y me parece un juego de lo más currado, muy completo y bastante esprime cerebros. Vamos el típico en el que nunca ganaré aún así me parece un juego fantástico, en cuanto a mecánica si no el mejor de lo mejor que he probado.Al final me lo he pillado en la geeks tore.

I honestly expected more out of this game. I can tell it's one of those which grows on you (no pun intended - coral, and all) on repeated plays, but it still seems very dry, and the strategy is difficult to sort out.

For a game that looks so fluffy, it was quite a brain burner. It seemed that it would be a deceptively fast game. The only complaint is that the rules read like stereo instructions. Original mechanics, clever cut throat action. Great game that I believe will get better with more play. ORIGINAL R&D Version

RATING: 7
Positive experience my first time playing.  Not as big a brain burner as others' comments led me to believe, but maybe that is because I haven't seen all the possibilities yet.  The abstract feel and pasted-on theme are my chief complaints, but not enough to keep me from playing this again.

Definately a gamer's game.  This is a complex abstract strategy game, that has not quite grabbed my attention enough to buy or play (more than a few times).  I need more plays to make a more accurate analysis.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Mechanically simpler than the rulebook suggests but there is a lot of depth and complexity in the tactical choices. What makes my brain hurt is that players have a lot of discretion in how they order their actions in their turn with many internal interconnections, and getting it wrong can be fatal. But it's such a engrossing game, especially when deciding when and where to start eating your shrimp! I can't see me playing this other than online, so I can really ponder my moves without making my fellow gamers wait. Would be excellent on a tablet (iOS) platform. Face to face sessions would have too much downtime while each player updates their strategy and make their decisions for the turn. Reef Encounter reminds me of Tigris & Euphrates but I like Reef Encounter more. Overall, Reef Encounter is a game I respect for its design but doubt I'd play it frequently.

Preliminary rating after a single play in which I started well but faded very quickly (on the second round, if I'm honest!)  I always felt several rounds behind the play.  If this is finding Nemo I was the Sushi.  Will play again and expect to grow stronger (after feeding on plankton.)

RATING: 8
First impression after two plays - the components are awesome. The rulebook is tricky, you just have to read it once, try to play, fail miserably, then read it again. You'll have it after that.

People with AP should play something else. Many decisions have a complex cascade of consequences. It's a brain-burner.

I thoroughly enjoyed both games, both of which were 2 player, and look forward to trying it with 3 or 4.

I fell in love with it instantly & the theme actually works pretty nicely & rocks. The game is still a bit dry, even though I like the visuals and the mechanics. The dryness is basically what dropped the rating (from the 9 I gave it after only two games).

RATING: 6
I've only played this once so far so I'm neither an expert nor am I saying my rating will stay at this level after further plays but as of now it's a 6.

I went into the game with an open mind and actually thought the game was going to be very good as I prefer "thinky" Euro games such as this. It definitely has a lot to think about as you attacks corals, eat corals, flip coral tiles, obtain alga tubes, obtain polyps etc. Each round you have 10 actions (although one option is doing nothing) so there is always something to think about as the board evolves and changes every round. The rules as many have noted aren't that intuitive to grasp as the game play is somewhat circular in nature.. Do A to obtain B.. With B you can do C...when you do C you can then do D... Once D is done you get points for E... etc

It's all a bit complex as you first try to formulate an idea of what strategies will work best at realizing the penultimate goal of having the highest scores by your parrot fish consuming the most valuable corals throughout the game.

So if the game has lot's of decision making and room for strategy/tactics... and I am predisposed to liking those types of Eurogames... then why didn't I like Reef Encounter on our first play? Well, I can't say for certain as I don't have enough experience yet but for one thing... the game feels somewhat repetitive and fiddly. It's not that it's overly complex... just that you seem to have to go around in circles a lot to get things done and there's a lot of cube and tile moving and removing and flipping over and back again every turn. Maybe I'm reaching a stage where "cube confusion" is settling but it just seems like this is one of the more abstract thematically rich games in the Euro genre.

The game certainly has a good theme and it does come through in the gameplay quite well... and the graphic design of the game is quite nice to look at. It all still does feel abstract though as we push cubes around and flip tiles.

For now though I'm certainly willing to give this more tries and my rating certainly may climb from the 6 level... but I'm being as honest as I can be in saying that so far... Reef Encounter just doesn't really float my boat yet. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Reef Encounter is a fantastic ecosystem of intertwined mechanisms. It's basically a tile placement game with the added challenges that several steps are required each time you want to earn points and both the strength and the values of the tiles can be manipulated by the players.

To succeed, you have to plan several turns ahead, both yours and your opponents', and you can never rest as you literally have to eat your "economic engine" and start over again to continue to score. Add to that a beautiful and colorful board and you have a close to perfect game.

Players take on the role of shrimp and parrotfish. Play down polyps (represented by tiles of 5 different colors) and eat them with your shrimp to earn VPs. Polyps can eat other polyps to give you options during your turn, and polyps can change in the food chain order, which players can permanently fix, and enhance the score of the tiles you have eaten. Many options on your turn and very engaging.

RATING: 8.5
Very abstract and initially confusing to get your head round. Certainly worth it though as once you get passed the odd names and words used, there lies a very simple yet deep strategy game.

Similar to Tigris in a few ways. Coloured tile placement. Domination. Slightly aggressive if you choose.

Only played with 2, but it's still great.  Would love to try more players.

This game has a lot of thinking going into a single point scoring action.  Points are only scored 4 times in the game per player, and not necessarily at the same time.  With multiple players the game can be quite brutal.  Starts off pretty slow, and the game is extremely abstract.  The artwork is really good, the theme is ok.  The actions seems clunky and people are subject to Analysis Paralysis throughout the game.  You have to think as high as 4-5 actions ahead in order to pull something off.  That can cause a lot of AP.  Consumed polyps are key to the game, to such a degree that it is really what the game is about (not the parrotfish consumption, but coral fighting other coral).  A lot of business on the board and the Open Sea Board.  Would like to try it with 4 players to see if my opinion of it changes.

This is a pretty simple game to learn. The actions are straight forward and are entwined with other actions, but WOW what a mind bender. I played this with three new players and we were all at one time or another literally scratching our heads about what action to take and what to do.  Everything is so subtly connected it was amazing trying to figure out what tactic to apply.

Second game was even more interesting than the first. The depths this games requires in order to accomplish good scores asks the players to monitor so much information and figure out the algorithm that makes one decision better in the projected long term. Only the long term can be altered very easily by competitors unless precautions are taken.

Gamer's game with a terrible rulebook... could not learn it the first time around. All the different pieces and terminology: polyp tiles, corals, alga cylinders, larva cubes, parrotfish, shrimp, every page a different dimension and layer. It all comes together into a cohesive game with a really cool and dynamic set of dominance rules among the five colors of coral. I get it and I like it; there's a surprising amount of combat and interaction given the marine wildlife theme, yet the balance and feel is very euro. Shout out to Dice Tower review with Ryan Metzler for helping our learning group make sense of the rules.

This game is good, real good.  My first game was not a great experience since I was not told the "you need 4 coral to consume" rule.  I effectively shot my wad early with some good tile pick ups and attempted to end the game quickly.  However, not knowing that rule for my fourth consume, I then had to waste another 3-4 turns with no resources to end the game.  This resulted in a not so good outcome.

That said, the game is beautiful and the strategy/tactics are awesome.  I would love to play this again with the many lessons and observations I accumulated during the first play.

Once you figure out the rules (including that a coral and coral tile are not the same thing), the game is actually not very complex. You need to think ahead in order to do many things on your turn, so linking everything to optimize each turn is important, but the actual actions and goal are straightforward. Overall a very original and fun game. Looking forward to more plays.

The theme is really strange, and it makes it tough for new players to grasp the game.  After a few plays though, it's easy to appreciate this brain-burner.  Don't try to make sure you do something on every turn though, sometimes the best thing you can do is build up your tiles until you have enough.

There's a ton of hidden-but-trackable information in this game, if you are one of those crazy-memory people, it may be a big advantage.

TRY Nov/05: Unbelievable learning curve; way too complex with unfamiliar & repetitive terminology.  Coral boards, coral tiles, polyps, consumed polyps, larva coral, algae cylinders.  Add in player colours matching (or not) cube colours matching (or not) algae colours... Ugh!

Too many mechanics; doesn't really match the underwater theme.  Feels very abstract when I played (on spielbyweb.com), and very fiddly.  Seemed weird to have just 5-7 turns, and very BIG turns (while everyone else just sits & waits).  I found it very uninteresting, overall.

Sure, there are ways to control the scoring, and you can try to limit the other players by eating their unprotected corals.  But with the shrimp protecting up to 5 coral tiles, and with 5 tiles being good enough to score points, this seems to prevent offensive plays (ie. creativity) by making defense too easy.

I'll play if someone else wants to, but in no way would I see the point of owning this, nor trying to teach others how to play.  The payoff isn't worth it.  Was HIGH on my wishlist, and is now removed.

I wanted to like Reef Encounter, so much so that I gave it a second play after a not great first experience with 4 players. The 3-player game is better, but it still feels like a clever game that doesn't make it to being fun. I'm sure the chaos could be learnt and managed to a greater degree with more plays, but I didn't enjoy the learning process enough to want to give it a third try.

I love this game. It is an absolute favorite, every time I've played it (four so far) I increase its rating a little. The ruleset is very straightforward but it can be tricky to play well, never in a frustrating way, but such that the game offers a sense of accomplishment when you do coordinate a series of strong moves.

My favorite aspect is the manipulation of the coral dominance tiles for points and for allowing you to consume tiles into resources.

It's owned by a friend, and I play it about every 8 months on average, but I think about this game more than any game I own.

Its more for fans of economic speculation games then for those interested in marine biology.

This one has grown on me with each play. 

In the first time I played I realized there was a lot of stuff to pay attention to but I wasn't able to plan or execute anything useful. Usually, in a given turn you do parts of a larger plan that will come together two or three turns away. If you don't know what you're trying to do, it's hard to understand why you should do anything on your turn. That's why the game's so hard in the first couple of plays.

Also, having tiles in front of your screen is crucial. If you're not able to get some, you'll be severely limiting your options because you'll be unable to manipulate the stock market. And the market is the core of the game. New players tend to forget this and miss a big part of the fun.

After a couple of plays everything clicks in.

Seems like a good game so far, reasonable amount of challenge. Now played both with 2 or 4 players, get less opportunity to play strategically with more players, as more people to do things before your turn, i.e. luck becomes more important. Possibly 3 maybe the best number of players.

Interesting game -- took a while to get the hang of it on my first play, so I'm anxious to try it again now that I have a better understanding of strategy.

I’ve only gotten in one game and I’m dying to play again. This is exactly the kind of brain-burn that I love in games. Reef Encounter isn’t perfect, as it seems that it may be slow and there isn’t anything for a player to do on his turn, but the mental challenge of trying to manipulate coral strength to make my consumed corals more valuable than those of my opponents is excellent.

RATING: 6
Very fine game that involves a lot of thinking and decisions, forcing you to work many turns ahead.  As such, there is some downtime involved each turn, but it's not overwhelming, as it can be in Tikal.  There is a lot of conflict, and players can make a lot of defensive plays as well.  Has a tremendous amount of depth, and I feel as though I've barely explored it.  After a few more plays (and an extended period of a lack of play) I don't miss it.

Ingenious placement game that has simple rules, almost no luck, but many great brain-burning decisions. It takes several turns to get used to the rules (they are maybe only 10 basic moves), but then there are many great ways to play once you learn the basics. The best compliment I can say for a game like this is that I wouldn't change anything about it. It's perfect the way it is.

RATING: 5.5
This game seems to encourage AP, even in people that would normally not take that long each turn, because you almost have to memorize what colors other players score and what you can score when influencing the color domination tiles. Additionally, I find it frustrating that you end up with piles of tiles that you can't use behind your screen - I wish there was a trade-in mechanism or something you could do with them.

RATING: 9.3
Apparently Richard Breese got the idea for this game from watching a Blue Planet special on coral reefs.  It has parrotfish and shrimp and algae and coral varieties with shifting dominance relationships to one another that vie for territorial dominance by eating each other.  This game has one of the strangest dynamics of ebb and flow that actually feels like some bizarre underwater ecosystem.  It is brain bending and inspirational, and we always have a great time discovering new ways to devour your own and others coral for personal benefit.  Nothing is permanent in Reef Encounter, until you fix the dominance relationship of two coral varieties with an algae disk!

Nothing like it, and one of my favorite games of all time.

A tricky game with a far-fetched theme and a somewhat convoluted game play, yet gripping and tense. It is a combination of tile placement, area control, negative space, and stock purchase & stock price manipulation. Reminds me a little bit of EL Grande and Tigris & Euphrates, but not as elegant and tight as those games. It is probably best with 3 and more chaotic with 4. It is a challenging game and takes at least one play to feel comfortable with its intricacies and strategies.

Gros jeu et ambiance très sérieuse. Malgré le thème, un jeu très abstrait aux règles complexes, dont certaines artificielles car ajoutées pour interdire les stratégies dégénérées.

Les mécanismes sont excessivement tarabiscotés et parfois frustrants. Pratiquement, on ne peut construire un territoire qu'en capturant ses propres pièces (celles des adversaires sont toujours protégées), parfois même en utilisant les pièces adverses pour cela. Weird!

Pourtant si l'on survit à la lecture des règles et à la première partie (largement plus déconcertante que Tigre et Euphrate), on découvre un jeu pas inintéressant. Trop tarabiscoté toutefois pour que j'en fasse l'un de mes favoris où que je le fasse découvrir à tout mon entourage.

Fairly abstract and dry tile laying game. I tend to like games like this, and this game offers some interesting choices. you grow out your corals and try to protect them before eating them. The bigger they get, the more points they are worth when eaten, but the harder they are to protect. The value of what you've eaten can go up or down depending on the orientation of tiles on a main board that depict what types of corals beat which other types.

It gets complicated quickly, and it's hard to know when you've made the right choice. I thought it was interesting but somewhat anti-climactic at the end. Other players who usually enjoy dryer abstracts with me, thought this game was a little too dry.

Reef Encounter is pretty mind-blowing, but I don't think the rules are as hard to understand as people make out. It feels a bit like playing Tigris & Euphrates while simultaneously manipulating the relative values of the colours you are collecting. Very pretty and evocative of its theme too.

An intriguing game which has quite a lot of visual appeal despite the thin theme. The game play is a tad dry unpolished (The reference sheet has an "Action 8" which is "not to take an action"), but becomes more intriguing as you go along. I found a bit too much going on for my taste and it is real feat of concentration to keep track of all the factors that are playing into the final score, lots of mental bookkeeping, which is not a bad thing if that is what you are into, but it is easy to loose track and trail behind if you do not pay attention all the time. I understand that this is the whole point of the game but my point is that it might not be for everyone and it feels like a competitive puzzle/sandbox game with all of the dynamics being the other players (mostly). Still, a good game and if played within a group of balanced playing strength it is quiet satisfying.

ONE OF THE WORST RULE BOOKS EVER. This lost a rating point just for that.

Relatively straightforward game despite the awful rules. Grow your clumps. Attack clumps to get important special powers essential for scoring and determining what can attack what. The game converges cleverly as you have to eventually wipe out your groups to score them.

Lots of AP, but the AP I don't like: The kind of time wasted in seeing what moves are possible.

Not as interactive as Tigris and Euphrates, the game to which it's often compared. Much of the interaction is more by necessity rather than bashing the leader.

-I find myself liking it more everytime I play it. Its mechanisms and procedures are not obvious in first plays, but are very satisfying to discover and even more to learn how to use them.

The downside:
-It could use a much better rulebook. Either in content and design. Comic sans? Really?

RATING: 7.3
The rules are reasonably simple (though not trivial), yet the complexity of options they produce was bewildering.  I felt lost through most of my first game, and whenever I made what I considered to be an insightful play with devastating effect, the other two players (both veterans) quickly pointed out that I had foolishly benefitted one or the other of them to my own detriment.  Somehow, I still managed to outscore the the most tactically-minded veteran, so perhaps my moves weren't so foolish after all.  But it will take me several more games of Reef Encounter before I can tell - games which I will enjoy playing.  This is a game of hundreds of possibilities, thousands of combinations, and no clear-cut (to me anyway) best move.

I wanted to like this game really bad.  I love the theme and the artwork.  I spent hours working through the rules so that I would make the best first impression of the game with my wife.

There is so much stuff in the box, I didn't even feel bad as I threw the insert away.  This game has such cool components that it is almost more toy than game.  Fortunately, it also is a great game.

This is a game that I can tell will reward many plays just like Race for the Galaxy does.  I also think that I will probably prefer two player matches of Reef Encounter. 

***Update***

After a few plays, I've decided that there are advantages and disadvantages to more players vs. less players.  The game is shorter with two which is a plus.  It's also more chaotic with more people.  This could be considered an advantage or a disadvantage depending on your perspective.  I like Reef Encounter quite well with three people.

Have only played this a couple of times as a 2 player game. 
First read the rules and thought "huh?" Took a quick solo set up and couple of test turns to realise that it wasn't as confusing at it first sounded. Explained it to my partner who also thought "huh?". Played it and, despite a couple of teething errors in the first game, realised how simple yet complex the game is. The second game went much better as we'd seen how all the different options can affect the game.
Looking forward to playing it some more as I'm sure it will continue to improve.
Good game.

[3-25-2010] Second 4p play - another excellent session.  Upgrading rating to a 9.

[3-4-2010] First 4p play with the gaming group.  A bear to explain but simple to start playing.  I'll need quite a few more plays to figure out how to play well.  The definition of a gamer's game.  I think everyone in the group enjoyed this one.

[2-13-2010] Solo learning play - I'm amazed at the possibilities - very open ended play, tons of decisions.  Definitely not for noobs.  A shout-out to Board Games with Scott for the awesome instructional video.  If you are learning this one out of the rule book this video is a must watch.

(+) Colorful game
(+) Reasonable playing time
(+) Very original and clever gaming mechanism, it really feels different and it works well
(+) A lot of tactical options

(-) Can feel a little 'abstract'
(-) When playing with more than 2 players, the game tends to shift from a strategic to a more tactical playing style, as the influence of a single player on the course of the game significantly decreases which limits strategic possibilities.
(-) Some downtime as an individual turn of a player might take a while, combining all sorts of actions before ending his turn.
(-) The most ridiculous player aid in human history - stupid attempt to add some theming in the manual which makes reading it a pain (and so is the comic sans font which is used in the manual!)

A very, very heavy ruleset for an abstract game.  To me, a heavy ruleset is fine if it's linked by an appropriate theme.  An abstract game is fine if the ruleset is simple.  But heavy rules in an abstract game are no fun to figure out!  Nothing is intuitive!  And even though things *almost* come together in a very neat way, and even though there are some truly clever moves possible in this game, your plans fall apart 99% of the time with more than 2 players.  It's a game where your ability to do that great, incredible thing depends on everyone else not trying to stop you for a turn.  You have to luck into that.  This would be fine if it worked as a tactical game.  It doesn't.  Like Power Grid, accumulation of points involves coordination of a multi-stage process--collecting coral, placing coral on the board, consuming coral, and locking dominance.  Unlike Power Grid, you have zero ability to coordinate if your opponents realize what you're up to, and they always do!

However, it does work as a 2-player game. With only 2, you can follow-through that brilliant plan of yours!  But since the game is so rules-heavy and abstract, it's too much work for the payoff.

RATING: 9
Reef Encounter tells the story of life and death on a coral reef. Players share the same board space, and they can all control the growth and expansion of coral, but you do not necessarily play a single type. In fact, you must strive to score in as many types of coral as possible, with the caveat that certain types may score higher than others. Those corals that score higher, are the types that are more powerful, and the types that are more powerful are same types that you can place to consume the weaker coral, which then contribute to your final score, but the points you obtain from scoring those coral are dependent on...wait, wasn't I just here?

Therein lies the genius of Richard Breese's design. There is a certain "circle-of-life" quality here, where players must wrestle with discovering where exactly they can fit amidst its processes. Somehow, Reef Encounter manages to convey life on a coral reef as if it were a battlefield. Coral strength changes throughout the game, and through clever manipulation of the strength tiles, your parrotfish may be able to eat vast areas of coral for a hefty sum of points. However, "your" (and the quotes are intentional) areas are never fully safe from harm, as swathes of coral unprotected by your shrimp (i.e. the Guardians of the Sea) are prone to be consumed by stronger coral, or worse, eaten by other players' parrotfish for their own gain.

Reef encounter comes off as an abstract game, but from the way Mr. Breese describes the premise, its mechanisms do seem to parallel, to some extent, the ecosystem of a coral reef--they create interactions so interwoven and so organic that they must have been intentionally designed. The player interaction here is so brutal it is clinical, there is depth present nearly as boundless as the sea, and these concepts are all encapsulated in a cohesive set of mechanisms. Marvelous!

might well be a good game for those who like staring at a board for a LONG time but just not for me. i seem to struggle with this kind of thing - spatial planning and action points. also i find the theme unintuitive

RECOMMENDATIONS:

tigris&euphrates - i prefer the theme and hidden tiles makes for a faster game

Bought in Essen 2005. We had t orefer often to the rules, during game. Downtime may be a problem either, since you have nothing to do during other player's turns. So the game proceded slowly, but it was very tense and everybody enjoyed it! A lot of decision and of dirty plays.

Wish the rules were better written, but the Beginner's Guide helps distill the key points into something more understandable.  The game won't make sense the first few rounds, but with a few practice rounds, then it starts to make sense.  Once it makes sense, it is a very nice development game with move tension and conflict over areas/superiority.  Plays quickly and a fun ride the whole way.  I like the mix of current move tactics combined with strategy over a few moves as the last actions in a turn are setting you up for your next move.  Very enjoyable game.

Reef Encounter of the Second Kind

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
08-03-2015. Rated after 1 play. Reef Encounter is a game for 2-4 players in which you play 'fish' eating coral. The game ends if a player as eaten his 5th coral reef OR when all reef values are locked in place. Value of reef is determined by which color reef dominates over other colors.

Each turn, you may do many actions, some several times. First, you determine if your fish eats bits of coral. Subsequently, you may grow reefs if you spend a cube in the color of the reef and have reef tiles of that color in your supply. If you ever replace other reef tiles, you get those in supply. You are then able to use those tiles to get cubes, which you can use to lock and change the value of those reefs. At the end, your last action is to pick a couple of new tiles and a cube.

I did think Reef Encounter is an good game. It's mechanically incredibly solid to my understanding after playing it once. But it feels like you are making many though decisions, but in the end you play a fish eating coral and manipulating values. There is no theme here, nor soul in my book.

----------

I really enjoy this game... it's a bit like Tigris with an abstracted stock market that determines both coral power and end game victory points.  It is a strategic game, but it becomes more tactical as more players are added; I love this game with 3 (definitely the sweet spot)... it's also great with 2, but not nearly as good.  

I honestly wish the boards were bigger, which I think would lead to more conflict.  But, I do enjoy the tension as you grow your reef, because once you exceed a certain size, you open yourself up to attacks.  

I also like the invaluable "eaten polyp tiles."  As a player, you MUST conserve these for later, when locking down tiles is more important, but if you want to unleash an assault on a vulnerable (yet dominant) coral, you can play the cost/benefit of sacrificing a tile for hurting your opponent.  Great decisions to be made here.

I still feel like conflict is more with 3, which I like -- this game isn't much fun if there isn't much conflict.

I've played this twice.  To me it is a good game...sort of.  There are too many times when it seems like you 1) don't have control over your fate and 2) what the hell am I supposed to do now?.  It seems like planning is very short ranged and has a solitare feel to it.  The learning curve makes it impractical to teach someone and the instructions remind me of stereo instructions (still in their native Korean).  I enjoyed the unusual ideas put into the game, but there isn't enough there for me to bring it out to the table much.  In fact, I played my copy twice and sold it to a friend who loved the game.

Cool game about building up and devouring coral reefs to earn points.

A fun, chaotic, adorably weird game. Breese and I must be on the same gaming wavelength; I love his stuff.

I don't know why people think this is a heavy game. It's lighter than, say, Princes of Florence, because there's a strong tactical element that disrupts long term planning.

It's a bit clunky and oddly paced, but I'm enjoying this greatly on SBW nonetheless.

Approx weight: 1400 grams - Z-Man games
I actually found the rules very easy to understand when I had all the game pieces in front of me and I skipped over all the purple hint text. (The text is perhaps a little wordy and does try in parts to over explain things.) I found myself engrossed in all the action and evaluating all the options, but at the same time I didn't feel like it ever bogged down or became too much of a brain burner. I liked the scoring where each polyp tile was only worth one point in itself - the other four potential points are on the open sea board. This added an extra dimension to the set collection that is vital to scoring well. Lots of options, downtime not excessive, lots of player interaction, nice theme and bits, reasonably quick game - what's not to like? Well, the game relies on each player pulling their weight to a certain extent to keep the other players in check. Especially in a four player game when a couple of the players aren't doing this the game becomes frustrating. There's only so much a single player can do to stop another player from running away with it. The frustration is exacerbated by the fact that a low interaction game is just boring. After several plays this game has lost its shine for me and is only something I'll bring out on rare occasions - never with more than three.

I like Breese's designs because they're completely confrontational and cutthroat, wrapped up in cutesy themes--wolves in sheep's clothing, indeed. Here we have coral, and shrimp, and alga--a nature show on the Discovery channel. But nature's red in tooth and claw. Eat that coral; block it with your shrimp; feed it all to your hungry parrotfish. This is not for people who don't like confrontation...luckily I do.

So many things to consider hence the brain-burniness.  Do I pick up the polyps that I need?  Or the larva cube that I need?  Or take the ones that the guy after me is really going to want!!??  Aaargh!  But very satisfying and such a beautiful looking board and sundries.

For me I don't mind heavier games when the decisions aren't based on pure calculations - and here there's a tonne of things you need to consider.  The rulebook I thought was attrocious, but after reading the quick-guide here on BGG, a video review from Bookshelf Games then another by Scott Nicholson then re-reading the rules I wondered what all the fuss was about because it's not a hard set of rules to understand - there's just a lot of options you need to consider and a tonne of different ways you can use the pieces you've got on hand.

A great game.

Clearly worthy of all the praise, this one is difficult for me to rate.  I like games which feel constructive (this did not), and I'm simply not good at abstract area control (which certainly describes some elements of Reef Encounter).  I felt like I was struggling for most of the game.  I could see and appreciate the game mechanics -- I just couldn't master them.  At all.  

But.  

There's so much to admire.  The balance of having to choose between taking larva cubes with random polyp tiles or taking tiles with an unnecessary cube.  The necessity of trading only [b][i]consumed[/i][/b] cubes for alga cylinders (or matching tiles).  Having to eat one shrimp before you can lock coral colors, but limiting the number of shrimp, so you don't want to eat that first shrimp prematurely.  Really good game.  Really bad at it.

The game seems to work well: there is abundance of choice and lots of tactical options.

One can be agressive or play conservatively. There are lots of factors to consider: heirarchy of tiles, what to choose, what corals to play, when to eat corals, when to flip the coral tiles.

There's sone E&T likeness in the play of the tiles but it's a well designed game.

It doesn't play like anything else I'm aware of, and while it isn't boring exactly, it isn't particularly thrilling either. There are so many moving parts, it can be hard to tell what's going on, or how to formulate a strategy beyond "make a big coral, eat it, and then try to control the dominance tiles to synergize with your biggest meal". 

I don't mind playing it, I just don't really understand what I should be doing or why which is a little unsatisfying.

Reminiscent of T&E, but the theme is more closely connected to the mechanics, and the rules are much more fiddly.

Ouch!  My brain!  This is really my type of game with really hard choices, plenty of player interaction, and manageable randomness.  I dig the theme, too.

I received this game as a complimentary copy from Z-Man Games as a "Thank You" for authoring the "Camelot Legends Werewolf" game on BGG.    

The game is very pretty, with excellent artwork and a nice look when layed out on the table.  I do admit, though, that some of the artwork on the original version looks a little better, especially the rock cards, as it is much easier to see which squares are playable and which are not on the older version.  

The rule book and the rules take some reading and researching to understand.  I take this as part of the game.  If you don't want complicated rules, buy something easy, like Blokus.  

Once you dive into the game and begin to play out scenarios, you start to see that all of those little rules are there for a reason.  Everything ties together to make an interesting and fun game, with good gaming decisions along the way.

Oh, and by the way, I stink at this game...

Sajnos nem sikerült végigjátszani a partit vele, illetve a szabályt sem tudtuk pontosan ettől függetlenül rövid véleményként azt tudom mondani, hogy sok lehetséges akció és azok kötöttsége, illetve nem kötöttsége, a sok tábla az egyes korallok egymás közötti erősorrendje mind megnehezítik a játékot. Szóval egy nehéz játékról van szó, ami tényleg hasonlít a Tigris és Eufráteszre, de annak szabályegyszerűségét meg sem közelíti, viszont a mélysége talán mindkettőnek hasonló. Nekem nem jött be, bár tényleg ennyiből nem szabad végkövetkeztetést levonni. A Tigris sokkal jobb. A játék számomra elsőre egyetlen előnye a szép kivitele és témája, bár az igazán nem jött át a játék közben.

This game is a clever cross between a stock game and a tactical wargame.  This is a game that takes several serious plays to realize the multitude of strategies.  Outside of just grasping how each different item works as currency, there is also the manipulation of end values by locking in certain colors.  The more the players lock up the values the more a player must manipulate the game play to match it, while foiling their opponent's plans.  Brilliant.  I suspect this will go up to a 9 with more plays. (Update: obviously it went up to a 9 now I think this is a  10)  It's all about expendable currency. Great with two better with four.

Z-man version
Reef Encounter is a very well-conceived themed abstract.  Players build corals of five different varieties (colors) on bare rock.  A coral is claimed, and partially protected, by placing a shrimp on it.  Additionally, there is the open sea board that shows the fluctuating state of dominance in the coral world.  For example, sometimes Red coral can replace White coral, sometimes vice-versa.  The dominance situation can be changed globally by any player on their turn, but players can also lock in specific dominance states for the rest of the game.  Finally players can feed their own coral, shrimp and all, to their parrotfish.  It is the coral tiles in the parrotfish that are counted at the end of the game.

There are 10 actions a player may take on a turn, some of them repeatedly.  This presents many options (on some turns) to drastically affect the board setup and mess with your opponents' plans.  Thus, experienced players will play defensively, so as not to expose unprotected coral tiles for their opponents' consumption.  This tendency for defensive play can lead to some extended pondering, which could lead to some dragging.  However, there's something about this game that makes a touch of AP ok.  There are a few rules about attacking coral that provide really interesting options for clever defense.  And the ability to protect and deprotect your coral allows you to recover from an untenable offense, and even consume your own coral with another to enhance your flexibility.  The rock on which the corals are grown have asymmetric holes that don't support coral growth that can both provide natural defense and stymie growth of your coral.

I'm very impressed with this game, but I had to give it a 7.5 because I know I wouldn't always be in the mood for it.  It's quite demanding.  Quickly: plays very well at 2-4, components are fantastic, rules are well done with good examples.

Really, really like this one.  While it is a brain-burner and can drag a little with those that are A/P prone, I love the chaining of the actions and the dynamic nature of the gameboard.  

UPDATE: Just continues to get better with more plays.

Pretty cool, but I don't think I quite get it yet: it all seems somewhat random to me. Also, the theme is a little difficult to get into: I can see that in some ways (mechanisms) the game is well-themed: if you stare at just the 4 boards, you might be able to see an abstracted version of the events of a coral reef. But it's impossible to put myself into the game! Who am I? Why do I get to move the shrimp, eat the corals, and pick which algae do what? In that light, it feels like I'm just "pushing cubes around". Need to play this FTF some more.

I continue to really like this game.  It does play a very good 2 player game but I prefer it most with 3 players.  It is hard to find people who can play this game without suffering from some sort of AP so most 4-player games can get a bit slow.  This game has plenty to think about, so don't leave your brain at home.

A wonderfully tense game where players execute limited actions to achieve a number of strategic goals (feeding one's parrotfish, attacking other players' corals, salting the board with polyps to feed one's corals, locking in coral domination tiles, etc.).  There are many delicious decisions to be made throughout the game, and players must maintain tile flexibility in order to adapt to changing board conditions.  This hits a sweet spot for me, and I have an insatiable craving to play it again and again.

Shame on the original manufacturer for only producing a few copies.  Kudos (again) to Z-man games for bailing us gaming peons out and allowing even the "undeserving know-nobody worms" to get a copy as well.  I love reef encounter.    Will play almost any time.  Only reason this doesn't have a ten is the tendancy for other players to develop some analysis paralysis.

RATING: 8
This game is surprising in a couple of aspects.  First of all, there's the theme.  Who would've thought to create a very thematic game about life in a coral reef with game mechanics that are supposedly true to the theme?  Secondly, it's a heavier Euro-style game that I actually enjoyed playing even on the first play.  Now that's saying something!  It helps that the game, while initially quite confusing, seems to fall into place after only a few turns, and it seems to move along at a good clip (or at least I was immersed enough in the game that it felt that way).  The depth of the game is in the strategy, and making sure you plan ahead at least a turn or two.  There is a definite nasty factor in the cutthroat nature of the those killer corals, but I find the direct player interaction to be refreshing in a Euro-style game.  The components are quite nice too (are they called "shreeples" or "shrimpeeples"?), although after the snorkeling I've done in the Caribbean I would have liked to see some more interesting-looking coral.  Just don't introduce humans in the next expansion or that lovely reef will be decimated in no time...  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 3.5/5  Total: 8/10

RATING: 7.5
A difficult one. The mechanics are clever and elegantly interlocking; the game is [i]deeply[/i] strategic.

Unfortunately, the obverse of everything that makes the game great is that it is both difficult and strategically opaque: new players get a glazed look in their eyes after the rules explanation and say, "I have no idea what to do." That isn't a problem for everyone, but I literally can't remember the last game I played with more than two players where at least one wasn't learning.

It's a game I like a lot -- but I expect to hardly ever get to play it and for those plays I do have to be potentially unsatisfying teaching games.

Still not sure I have really wrapped my head around it. This rating could move either direction, though I am less likely to play now that I don't own a copy. The reasons I traded it away were a combination of things. My wife wouldn't even attempt to play it, and the last time I played, an opponent (in his first game), used a blitz strategy that was difficult to react to and kind of made the game lose its luster for me.

After playing this once, I wasn't sure what all the fuss was about.  Reading the rules more carefully I discovered that we'd missed a crucial rule: feeder shrimp don't just protect the tile they're on, but the orthogonally adjacent ones as well.  The second time I played using the correct rules it was a much better game.  The game still seems a bit too long, but that's probably just a lack of familiarity with the rules.

Simulating the ebb and flow of the tide, this game is very interesting with a huge selection of choices each turn. While this is good, it also has a high learning curve and often leads to analysis paralysis.

EDIT: Dropped down slightly as the attacking factor is a bit higher than I enjoy now. Still a great game but a bit too thinky and screwy for many (myself included).

RATING: 6
The game's original theme (growing coral reefs in order to feed a parrotfish) isn't really enough to raise it above mediocrity. The decisions you face throughout your turn take an awful amount of thought, especially if you cannot easily match your polyp tiles with your larva cubes, which is the key to winning the game. This means that there's a great deal of strategy needed to play the game well as there's so many things to consider during your turn e.g. which corals are dominant over others, using algae to alter the dominance of the coral tiles, which types of polyps/larva are available to you etc. Because of this it quite often feels as though there's too much thought required in order to be successful. I guess the game just doesn't make those decisions seem important enough to feel worthwhile, which is an obvious failing.

Reef Encounter is a great game that I'll gladly play on most occasions. It's full of tough choices and there's the constant "frustration" of not being able to do everything you want to on your turn coupled with the anxiety of waiting to see if your hard crafted plans will bear reward. For this, and also for the tile laying, shrimp moving aspects of play, Reef Encounter is reminiscent of Tigris and Euphrates. Reef Encounter can be somewhat abstract in play, but it nevertheless has one of the most elegant integrations of theme with game mechanics that I've had the pleasure to experience. If there's a down side to this game it's that Reef Encounter can get bogged down by players prone to analysis paralysis. I'm very glad to have Reef Encounter as part of my collection. Highly recommended.

The ebb and flow of this game is really interesting and hard for me to get a handle on.  Hunkering down in a corner and protecting your flank until you can grow a larger area to eat with your parrotfish seems pretty strong.  Having to balance this versus a faster rush strategy is interesting.  The manipulation of the stock like coral value tiles seems like where the real game lies.  If someone is locking down a color to score big points, why fight it?  Just join in on the fun, but can you get it done effectively in time?  Very good game.

First... Worth the money before reprint ($80+)? Even though I like it, I'd have to say no. It's a good game, but not twice as good as other games.
Played the first game wrong. Not the RULES, but the strategy. When we played our first game, we locked the coral tiles sooner than we should have and for no strong reasons. Someone having a few tiles of one color in their fish would start to lock that color. Later other people who didn't lock that color at all scored more tiles of that color. Also, we ended with some people eating only two corals (counting the last round) and I think that should have been four for almost everyone.

Next game went SO much better. People were attacking their own coral to get consumed tiles and making larger plays with these tiles later. This playing really showed how good the game is.

03 DEC 2010 - Have played it twice more now and still really like this game, if anything for the different sort of mechanics - quite unique and difficult to wrap your head around. I've now seen games with lots of small corals, gigantic super corals and a couple of other different kinds of play as well. Some people do not like the luck of the tiles coming out, but I think enough come out in general that you can mostly do something interesting most times. Yes, luck can be a bitch sometimes, but not enough on this for me to downgrade it.

29 MAR 2009 - Played first game @ Gamestorm and really enjoyed it. I've rated it 8.5 for now as I was expecting a bit more in the gameplay...I think it was due to inexperience of 3 of the 4 players (including me) and I have higher expectations in the future. I also supect 2 or 3 players will be better/less chaotic than 4.

Neat little abstract where you have to balance out your actions while paying attention to a number of things that can change the board. I'm not sure there is a load of depth here though. The strategy appears to be pretty straight forward, so it tends towards whom gets lucky enough to act first.

The theme is fun. The artwork is gorgeous. Some people compare the game to Tigris & Euphrates. Better informed rumors maintain that Reef Encounter is actually a stock investment game in disguise with enjoyable "take that" tactics. Forget Tigris -- the rumors are correct!

To begin, I think the comparisons to T&E are quite overstated. Timing your plays is more important than positioning, which is limited by the small and disconnected boards. That certain chains of coral can absorb others is less like conflicts in T&E and more like hostile mergers. If anything, it plays more like an elaboration (if you squint) on Acquire. You want to play tiles to the board that help increase the size of your corals, and then you want to make sure you are "invested" in the largest chains. If that doesn't sound like Acquire under the sea, then I don't know what does. Given that Acquire is one of my favorite games, it's all good news here.

Reef Encounter is almost immediately confrontational. Gameplay is fun. And yet I can never shake a certain reservation. Something about the four disconnected reef boards bugs me. They make the game space seem disjointed. Rather than a common map with one large battle for dominance, what you're really competing in is numerous smaller battles. I can understand the limitation on geography, but it also feels inorganic and samey. Finally, the multi-step process for playing pieces also left me with a feeling of inelegance.

I've played Reef encounter a number of times now, with 2, 3, and 4 players. Four is clearly my favorite as it has led to the most confrontation. You are forced to grow your corals next to the others, which in turn leads to more fights. This in turn makes the struggle to invest in the most valuable corals more interesting because the entire board is fragile and subject to interesting swings. When played this way, I love Reef Encounter.

Overall, the game is growing on me, but it is highly dependent on the players. With people who like to nibble away at corals and flip the dominance tiles (i.e., investments), the game is fun. With a more passive group or with fewer players, it's stagnate. I doubt this will be my go to tile laying game, but I do like it.

RATING: 7
This is a solid strategy game, but it doesn%u2019t quite make my top tier of games.  It seemed to drag just a bit more than I would like, for one thing.  And the domination tiles are perhaps too important.  Yes, it's important to control them, but they can really swing the number of points for a given meal in an almost crazy way.

Really neat game. Made my top ten after two plays (Even though I suck at it. I've lost every time so far!)

Update: after a few more plays and a re-hashing of my top ten, I've decided it's now number 1! (After accepting that Ticket to Ride was only no. 1 for nostalgic reasons and that Fortune and Glory, though perhaps my most fun game, is too random to deserve the top spot).

Plenty of options and opportunity for clever moves by players, and the theme and artwork are quite nice. Some poor color choices with components, though, which can cause some minor confusion.

I have played this a bunch on spielbyweb, and four times in person.  This game is an interesting one, and one where I haven't gotten a decent handle on the strategy yet.  I've won a couple times, but for the most part, I suck at this game.  I still really like it, I just wish I had a decent idea how to counter certain strategies and develop my own.

Even after playing a number of games of this, I still don't understand the strategy of the game.  I still like playing it though.

A bit difficult to grok at first, with all of its interrelated actions, but well worth fighting through the initial learning curve.  I certainly am still fumbling around a bit on my 5th play, but am gaining some coordination in synchronizing my actions.  I've played with 3 and 4 and enjoy it with both player counts.

Allows for surprising reversals of fortune with clever play - altering both the geography of the board, the heirarchy on the food chain and the value of various coral.  The components are colorful and of high quality, without having the artwork get in the way of functionality.  The rules, as noted elsewhere, are a tough read.

An interesting brain-burner.

This game has some interesting choices and is really thought provoking but I'm not really sure if it's that rewarding in the end. We also played with some wrong rules initially, so I don't how solid the mechanics really are.

The game is surely lacking in the theme however, or it makes little sense to me at least.

"It's a cutthroat stock market game, with colorful coral and adorable shrimples" or "Stock market under the sea, with shrimp" are pretty good hooks to get people to play once, and the elegant and deep mechanics keep them coming back.  This is an excellent game, and one I'm always willing to play.

This game has a great theme, is colorful, and is designed brilliantly. I just don't care for it due to the multitude of choices which face the player on every turn. And being more tactical than strategic, the choices change drastically from one turn to the next. Those who are paralyzed by analysis should stay away from this one.

Fairly computationally heavy game about growing your own coral reefs and consuming your neighbors' coral.  Tough to get a handle on the strategy at first, (there is a good amount of brain-burning planning behind it all) but if you are up for it this game is very well-designed.

RATING: 8
(1 play) A very nicely interwoven heavyweight game. I am slightly concerned about the level of chaos in the dominance manipulation early in the game, but (if I get a chance to play more often, which is challenging) that may not be an issue. Definite upward revision potential.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The game has excellent components. Rules are simple as long you have someone to explain them to you (the rulebook is not very helpful, it is better to download the beginner's guide from here). The game mechanics are very intricate and you will need at least 2 games to know what is happening and how to play. I didn't like that your fish can eat only 4 corals only. Right at the time things are getting very interesting, the game ends. No you cannot extend game play because of the locking mechanism of the algae. The game probably deserves a 9 if all players know how to play it.

RATING: 7

I sat down to play this game with another newbie and a guy who has "played it 200 times". That was the first clue I was in for trouble. The second clue was when the rules explanation met the board. The strategic placement of multiple coral reefs to protect against invasion wasn't something I got right away. About the time I started understanding that concept, the dominance/scoring tiles started getting flipped and I learned how that can completely change the game. The game started to come to an end and the experienced player had a coral reef on the board that exceeded my entire score and that was only about half his score. It was pretty much a runaway game.

There's a lot to think about in this game. Taking into account what coral can eat other coral and how that can change and who's likely to want to make it change is a lot of brain burny. It was pretty overwhelming in my first play, but I still really enjoyed it. I'm hoping that further plays will make this game come together a little bit more for me and that I can start to feel like I know what I'm doing instead of aimlessly wandering the ocean bed.

Eh. Ok game. Nothing more for me. Hard to understand, difficult to make decisions and a good deal of interaction between players. All of this I wouldn't mind, but the overall experience doesn't thrill me - it is just procedural. Not really fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Seemingly a commodity speculation game, but the commodity values are frequently static, are somewhat divorced from the action on the board (they affect the combat but are not affected by combat), and can change very suddenly. The winner/loser struck me as pretty random.

At the end of your turn you pick from a randomized selection of batches of one cube and up to three tiles. Typically the synergy within the batch is terrible (you need a cube to match tiles you want to place). I may have AP deciding which batch is the least pointless to take. (In theory you could try to look ahead to the future, but it isn't so easy to predict what other players will be doing.)

If you can't get the cube you need to place tiles of a certain color, the other thing you can do is see if you can capture a [i]tile[/i] of the desired color that you could then trade in for a cube. That involves working your way through the logic of the board that shows which colors can currently capture which. Pretty abstract.

On paper there are way too many things you could do on your turn, but I seem to whittle them down without much trouble. On the other hand, I'm pretty sure there are some excellent moves that I just don't perceive, and that kind of irritates me.

The Z-Man components are beautiful, functional, and the required play area is not very large. The game also doesn't take that long to play.

I might like this better without the commodity speculation. In other words: If the goal of the game were to consume the most tiles, period.

[Rated 2005/05/07 based on 1 play]

Tile-laying meets brain-burning strategy.  I suffered terribly from AP, and loved every minute of it.

There's no choice but to plan a number of turns ahead - because of the turn order, the resource relationship between cubes and tiles is quite delayed.  It's fun to plan, and it's very tense waiting to see if you can pull it off without someone else disrupting the final link in the chain.

The coral supremacy chart is brilliant - rock-paper-scissors that each player can tweak to their advantage, and finally lock in place if they play just right.

Also, the wooden shrimps are *so* cute!

If only it wasn't so expensive.  Fingers crossed for a re-print...

When this game was explained to me, I thought: "I will never be able to remember all these options and details!". Halfway through a game with four players I thought: "It plays like an abstract, downtime is horrible and I just cannot cope with all the factors you have to take into account when making a decision!". And yet, at the end of the evening I thought it was OK. A real brainburner, but there is a real incentive to develop a strategy and play differently next time. Just keep in mind that this is as hardcore "euro" as they get - and to be honest, I am rarely in the mood to work this hard for a leisurely game in the evening.

RATING: 8.5
After my first play, it was really hard to know how much I liked it because one of the players in my first game was really gushing, and it was hard to seperate his enthusiasm from my own.  After my second play, I was pretty sure.

The rules, at a scanning glance, seem pretty complex, but I had the benefit of a good game explanation and it wasn't a problem at all.  Once you understand the actions on the reference card, you pretty much understand the game.

It is a dynamic game, and every time you score, you give up territory and some of your ability to defend yourself.  This makes an interesting end game situation where a player's weakened defenses force them to prioritize and potentially leave valuable coral unguarded for other players.  There is plenty of room for clever placement, blocking, and sneak attacks.  I wish there was room for a fifth player, though.

RATING: 7
This is a game that I feel would really benefit from lots of plays (in a short amount of time), to really capture all of its nuances.  Unfortunately, I don't think I'll really ever get in that many plays, since tile-placement isn't the favorite genre of many in my group, and I'm not very good at explaining the convoluted rules.  Which is a pity, since there is a nice and difficult game in there.

I don't think this is 'Tigris with a stock market', even though both games do share a certain spatial viciousness. RE's scoring system doesn't reward aggressive play like in Tigris (although consuming polyp tiles is the only way to control the market and ensure you get maximum points). The timing of your actions seems a little more critical in this game, particularly when to feed your parrot fish the first and last times. There's definitely a greater feeling of tactical freedom in Tigris, but RE allows for more long-term planning. I enjoy both - they feel different enough to share shelf space with one another.

shared central area to place tiles. tiles are colored (5 total). tiles can consume other colors in a rock-paper-sci manner
on each turn players have a few action options. one action is to reverse the rock-paper-sci.. which could make it mean game
in the end you want to have a large area of tiles to consume and convert into points.

Very deep brain burner.  This game suffers from a common problem of deeper, drier affairs, which is that there is very little socializing as everyone tries to plan their next move, and that's always a little disappointing to me.  Every game's a little different, but not so much that there aren't some common strategies.  Mechanics are a bit baffling initially, and it took me several plays to "get" this game. Now that I feel like I understand it, I have a lot more respect for it.

Meaty tile laying area management game, where you build up coral reefs, then eat them for points when they're large. However, there are 5 different types of tiles, so you want to eating the tiles that will be worth the most at the end of the game. Players struggle against each other, flipping tiles which determine which types are stronger than others, which allows them to eat the reefs of their opponents.

We've only played it once, but it was very enjoyable. It seemed like there was a rhythm to find, where you build up, eat a large amount of tiles, then use that to grow a different reef even larger.

Rating after 4 plays. This is a very neat game and I like it. I especially like how things are all interconnected and visualizing the way the shrimp interact with the larva with the algae... so exciting. It will probably take more plays to fully flesh out this rating. **Update: 3plays** Very slow going at the beginning but the end came so suddenly; 1st 3/4 of the game is kind of "dull" and the last 1/4 just whizzes by because there are so many reactive changes going on. Chaotic yes but nice balance between greed and security.

Not only the theme but also the game play is unlike any other game. Reef Encounter crosses stock-manipulation with a puzzle-like spatial element and throws in a healthy dose of direct conflict.

Richard Breese (Key Harvest); life on a coral reef (by using polyp tiles, players grow different types of corals, which they can protect from being attacked by other corals through judicious placing of their four shrimp counters and to be successful, players must consume polyps from neighboring corals in order to acquire the 'consumed' polyp tiles that are the key to the game. The consumed polyp tiles have a myriad of uses (and have a similar effect to the action points in games like Tikal and Java). Most importantly they can be used to flip over or lock the coral tiles, which determine the respective values of the different types of coral at the end of the game); Category: Nautical, Animals;  Mechanics: Tile Placement, Set Collection, Commodity Speculation

The choices and challenges of the game are fine, but the chaos and the downtime take something away from the game.  It seems like it takes too much time to set up a good move, and you're too limited in the way you can protect your reefs to score like you need to to win the game.  It seems to play faster the more you know the game, but it still seems to last longer than I want it to.  Plus, the endgame can sometimes be dictated by how the tiles come out, since the manipulation of pieces is directed by what you get off of a certain cube that you need to make a final move.  Still, it's intriguing, and a decent game.

Reef Encounter is about life on a coral reef! Using polyp tiles, players grow different types of corals, which they can protect from being attacked by other corals through judicious placing of their four shrimp counters. To be successful players must consume polyps from neighboring corals in order to acquire the 'consumed' polyp tiles that are the key to the game. The consumed polyp tiles have a myriad of uses (and have a similar effect to the action points in games like Tikal  and Java). Most importantly they can be used to flip over or lock the coral tiles, which determine the respective values of the different types of coral at the end of the game.

I am really late to the Reef Encounter party. Now that I have finally gotten to play it, I understand why it was so popular back when it was released. In a lot of ways it feels like Tigris and Euphrates, even though the actual mechanisms for laying tiles and attacking other players are completely different. Like T&E, it is important to build a large area of control, but the bigger you get the more susceptible you are to your opponent's attacks. This creates an interesting push your luck situation, as large reefs can score lots of points, but your opponent's will rarely let them survive long enough to do so.

If I had picked this up five years ago, I would probably have played the crap out of it. Now, I don't really have the opportunity to play this type of game very often and when I do, I simply like Tigris & Euphrates better.

RATING: 7
A tile laying game in the vein of Tigris and Euphrates. You build a coral reef and try to consume it when it is the biggest in size. Also, you want your reef to be the most dominant to be worth the most points. An interesting mix of strategy and tactics. The theme is of fun colorful fish and shrimp, yet the encounters can be cut-throat.

Only played this online so far (SpielByWeb).  1st game was bewildering, 2nd was better although I still don't understand how to make use of the algae cube thing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
It is not a "see it and you'd like it" type of game. You need some time (except you are marine creature fancies) to get familiar with these polyp and algae tiles while there is some learning curve befre you get into the game.

However, the just right strategy and luck factor (of tile drawing) ensure no single golden rule to win the game. This provides a great replayability and you will discover more fun after a few plays. Definitely worth several plays before judging the game

RATING: 7
Very thinky!  This game kind of has a "collection of loosely related mechanics" feel to it, as the theme is not that tightly integrated.  But what is there of the theme is fun and charming--the little eyeballed lobsters are great.  It's tough to see the optimal route through all of the decisions, which is good.  Despite the fact that it is almost a complete information game, and has an abstract-y feel, players do so much on their turns that it can also feel kind of chaotic.  This feeling might diminish as I grow to understand the game better.  Looking forward to playing it more, and the rating could go up.

Neat game - I like the theme.  It's so blue!  Was getting tired by the end of it,  and would definitely play differently next time around.   There's definitely a tile-laying tactical aspect,  mixed in with some strategic planning of what corals to score.  Had to restart the game,  when we realised we had the starting layout wrong.   With the correct layout,  you were putting down coral and eating coral in no time :)

Scoring is pretty tough.  Maybe we ought to have rearranged the dominance tiles so that the values were more obvious or somesuch.  

Was pretty hard to look things up in the rules,  but once everything came together it was actually pretty easy.

RATING: 5
Read rules and thought it was going to hurt my head but when I played it the game flowed really well and my brain remained cool.  Maybe after several plays being totally au fait with the play and strats it may burn the grey cells more. Watch this space.  It is the most colourful and beautiful game I have played.

Having had a second game 7 (!) yrs later I have downgraded it from an 8 to a 5. For me it did not feel intuiative and I think in order to get the most out of the game, it would be necessary to play half a dozen times, none of which would be enjoyable, so we would end up playing something else so it would never happen.,shame cos it remains very beautiful and colourful!

Tough to rate without playing a bunch more. The tendancy for someone to blitz seems to take something away from what should be there, and even though the blitzer rarely wins, the temptation is cetainly there. Not as fragile as Fifth Avenue, but I wish it the games had more time to develop. Need to play more to decide.

There must be a good game in there because so many people like it, but I can't and won't find it. The theme is beyond dull to me, the instructions put me to sleep and I just can't get on board with the overall concept. Not a *huge* fan of area control attack games (ala Tigris) to begin with. My two goes at Reef Encounter left me with such a bitter taste I don't need to try it again.

My first play admirably demonstrated both how hard this game can be to explain and how easily it invited analysis paralisis... all the same it was a fine game and gave me a good taste of how enjoyably brain burny Reef Encounter can be. My second game was much less AP filled than the first... but the difficulty of explaining and grokking this game kept it from getting to the table so I ended up trading it.

Despite the general acclaim it received, I found it incredibly hard to find anyone willing to play Reef Encounter due to its steep point of entry.  So while I appreciate the depth with which how the mechanics work with each other, I can't help but wonder if the game is too complicated for its own good.  After all, no matter how good something else, does it really matter if no one is willing to play again?

Reef Encounter featured a strong theme, although I can't vouch as to how accurate it is.  The actions one could take felt rather unintuitive, which no doubt added to the long down time each turn.  The strategy seemed to be building a string of polyp tiles only to be removed later because the more you consume, the more you resources you will have to work with subsequently.  It was a lot more confrontational then I would have liked.  I also felt that towards the end, as the number of your shrimps decrease, your options become more and more limited in what meaningful actions you can take.

Difficult to learn and hard to play well.  I just don't think it has the pay off that one would feel after a long but fruitful session.  So you are left with the sense that you just experienced something that might have been good, but nothing you want to commit the time to again to find out.  Which is a shame.

This is probably the most theme heavy Euro I have ever played. I love the Ocean and have several Reef Aquariums so for me this was a must buy. For an older game it really is petty awesome. It has some great game mechanics that I haven't seen in any other game yet. It is a brain burner of a game though. So many choices you can make! 

One con is that I found the rule book sucks really really bad. Like it super sucks. It takes a page to explain one simple concept that should have been explained in a paragraph. Oh well. Watch the How It's Played episode instead and you'll get the rules super fast.

RATING: 7
Very intense game of trickily interlocking mechanisms.  For your first game or so, you might do well to try it on SpielByWeb, since it constantly shortlists your options to suit the circumstances.  That being said, this is a grueling, but interesting third-party struggle for dominance.  You make the coral grow, possibly consuming other coral over which it has dominance, and claim a coral territory as your own by guarding it with one of your shrimp.  You can manipulate the relative dominance of any pair of coral types, but you must choose the moment when it is most beneficial for you to have your parrotfish eat one of your shrimp and the coral it guards, thus earning yourself VP.  Ah, but the relative strengths of the coral types also determines their values in VP at the end.  Very good stuff, but not something you can casually whip out, teach to someone new, and expect them to offer you any competition.

If the rating simply reflected its brilliance, this game would be rather close to a [b][bgcolor=#00cc00]&nbsp;10&nbsp;[/bgcolor][/b].

Euphrat & Tigrises long lost sister.. Rating after first play, that dragged for eternity. This game is prone to AP.

6/18/07 - I thought I really liked Reef Encounter, but it seems every time it's my turn to pick out a medium/heavy weight euro, I find my hand gliding past it on the bookshelf.  What causes this apprehension to pull it out again, I don't know.  If I were to ask myself if I've had fun playing it in the past, I wouldn't hesitate to say "yes" (and I really dig the theme), but I'd be a liar if I didn't say something about it bugs me.  Until I figure out what it is, I'm forced to rate this a 6 by BGG standards.

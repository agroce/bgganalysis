Temática prehistórica para 3 está muy bien. Para 4 también funciona bien pero peor que con 3. A 5 no lo recomiendan. Juego de mayorías con un sistema de turno original. Quizá peca un poco de que si un jugador se escapa es difícil echarle el guante, cosa que también sucede en el Ursuppe.

Urland is a problematic game for me. I want to like it - the artwork is wonderful, the genes fun, the action points work well. But there's 2 turns in a row that you don't do anything. With 3 players, that's a huge problem. Not only is it boring, there's a huge lack of control - you barely have time to set yourself up for scoring, and there's certainly no time to have many grand long-range plans.
With more players this is better, but you still sit around for 2 turns. So either way I'd rather play something else.

After playing twice, it seems that the 2nd phase is a little too random. In my second game, I lead after the first island phase and had an established presence on nearly half of the remaining islands and still managed to end up in 3rd (out of 5). Maybe I&#039;m just bitter...Definitely a game I need to work on.

Purchased in Essen 2010. Singed by Doris and, most important, she drew one of her famous cute hedgehog in my box!

This game is so cute but... the gameplay is chaotic to the bone. A pity because it looks beautiful but, after the first play, Urland gives the impression that is half baked. If I keep this game in my collection is because it has a gorgeous artwork.

RATING: 4
Instant disappointment.  1 play.  Too random to be fun.  Two players get ZERO board actions EVERY round because they are involved in choosing islands for scoring.  Unbalanced play from the start of the game where 2 players just try to guess which of 11 islands might score (the start of each epoch suffers from this issue but fewer islands remain after the first epoch so the main problem is for the very first round of play).  The game combines a number of solid mechanics (area control, action point allowance, and special powers thru evolution) but the innovative turn order mechanic ruins the game.  You spend much of the game making slightly-educated guesses at which island will score.  Yuck!

UPDATE: While this was considered a weaker game than Ursuppe when it first came out, I actually think Urland has over time proved to be the substantially stronger game. Urusppe is quirkier and more individual, but Urland retains enough of the quirkinesss while delivering a far more solid fundamental game. This is the game I can see playing into the future, not Ursuppe so much.
---
I'm a little surprised by the slightly negative reception the early adopters have given this game. It's a very clever little game, a little prone to analysis by the truly compulsive, but not too bad (nothing nearly on the scale of Tikal or even Carcassone). There is a bit more to the chit-picking and passing than on first inspection. Functional, not too long, with a little subtelty - not one I'll play every week, but definately a winner.

RATING: 7
At its core its an "influence in areas" game, but its teamed with a bluff/deduction mechanism (which area will score) and bidding for abilities (genes). It also requires very tight decision making given the low number of actions in a game. Moves along nicely as long as you're not the "dummy" while an analyser is decising thier actions. The components/artwork are very cool too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
As much as I wanted to like this because I love mutation slash variable power games, every turn 2 out of 5 people have their turn skipped.  Just skipped.  I would have given a 5 (random area scoring blows too, El Grande is way better), but this is 3/5 of 5.

We probably got some rules wrong regarding the volcanoes.  They were very confusing.  But seemed like a pretty fun area control game.  Nothing earth shattering...and a little random, but still fun.

RATING: 7
The follow up game to Ursuppe, but rather different from that game. Players are trying to position their fish-like dinosaurs (&quot;Ichtos&quot;) onto the board, and into one of the 12 land areas. Majorities in land areas score victory points. The thing that is different about this game is on any given turn, one player does nothing, one player secretly chooses the score area, while the remaining players take a &quot;normal&quot; turn. At three points in the game, rule-breaking genes are auctioned off to further your cause. Control freaks are going to loath this one, but for me it&#039;s an intriguing mix of skill and bluff.

When the rules were being explained I did not think I was going to like this.  But this game surprised me, it is quite engaging.  It is painful when you have to sit out for a couple of rounds and watch while others make their moves.  The mutating cards offer a nice twist, the combination of flying and stink is quite powerful.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It's pretty hard to figure out a strategy by the rules alone - you definitely have to play a game to fully understand it; then all clicks into place. The game is pretty strategic and offers some hard decisions. The mutation cards can be very powerful or rather weak, depending on timing and situation. The artwork and bits are good quality. After 1 game of 5 people, I like it, but I wonder how the flow of game is with 3...

RATING: 1
Played once.  The problem with this game is a design flaw.  In a 5 player game the person sitting in the 4th chair is forced to act at a significant information deficit for 5 turns in the first epoch and then subsequently for 6 turns in the second epoch.

Explained: The other players all have information about which areas can possibly score at times when it is much more relevant and meaningful.  When the 4th player [b]finally[/b] gets some info that he can react to (on turn 5 in the 1st epoch and on turn 6 in the 2nd epoch), there are only 6 and 5 areas left to score - that makes his information much less valuable since the other players all have much higher odds of guessing which area will score among the fewer number remaining.  As the 4th chair, you are looking at the board for the first half of each epoch trying to guess which of 7-11 areas will score with [b]no data.[/b]  Everyone "up table" is getting special intelligence on what chits are in the possible scoring mix while you sit, totally blind, doing the best that you can with the other generally available info.

This flaw is a unforgivable playtest / design / development brain fart.

Basically, if you are in the 4th chair, it sucks to be you.

This could have been fixed by changing up the play order for the second epoch (thus not forcing the same player to suffer the same disadvantage for the entire game, i.e. "spreading the pain").  The 4th chair in the 5 player game is the only one that suffers for both epochs.

In my one play, I sat in the 4th chair and still came in 2nd.  The problem is not the outcome.  It's the frustration of watching the other players make informed decisions while you shoot bullets in comparative darkness.

It took a little while for the game to click with me. At first I was like, "WHAT???". Once I played though and got near the end of a game, it all came together and I was like, "Hmmm now I get it. That was quite interesting." It turned out to be a really fun game, that I'm looking forward to playing again.

Rating after one 4-player game. I have a feeling this would play better with 5 as there was too much down time with 4 as 2 of your turns each time around the table is going to be essentially doing nothing (being either the evironmental player, or the dummy player). While with 5 players you'd be doing someting more interesting 3 out of 5 of the time.

Played this for the second time (long break) in 2012.  After 2 more plays, I decided I would not keep this one.  I like it.  But half of my games have gone poorly because of other player's poor reactions to this game.  It's just oo variable, and I've gotten gunshy about suggesting this title.

Only played 5 games in the last 5 years. Area majority game that has neat mechanism of volcanoes resulting in island coalescing to form larger land masses. The genes are interesting but just not as fun as Ursuppe. The game feels as if it was not tightly designed and the balance seems off-kilter.

Another well designed dino game by Doris and Frank. A bit strange mechanism with two players not doing anything during a turn, but then the turns are short.

This gets overlooked too often, and every time we pull it out of the cupboard and play, we vow to play it again very soon. Which, somehow, does not happen.

Quick and clever. Dummy mechanic can feel weird at first look, but it works well when played. It feels very thematic. Wonderful artwork.

I only played this online a few times before that site went down. Like its predecessor (thematically, and with some mechanics), the bio-competition theme appeals to me, and the production is also a draw. I'm just not as wild about those special power/differentiation cards. But since those are at the heart of this game (and Ursuppe), I can't imagine a tweak that would address my concern. Still, I'd like to play a face-to-face game someday.

The theme is charming but not as eccentric as Ursuppe. Here, you get very few genes that never go away. The most important part is guessing which area will be scored, which isn't very interesting. The scoring mechanism seems prone to kingmaking and overbalancing.

01/17/02 Received. Be careful who you play this with. I had a guy have a religious hissy fit about its evolutionary theme. He went bonkers as soon as I said the setting was 300 million years ago. Then he gave everyone at the table a lecture on how the earth was only 6000 years old. I wish he'd just left. Instead he played, stewing the whole time with a scowl on his face, and made it a miserable experience for all (which I'm sure was his goal). 
I made little stand-up placards for the players to place in front of them to show their roles for the current turn. I felt this very important, since they constantly rotate. I was surprised the publisher merely assumed everyone would remember who was the Environmental player, Dummy, 1st, 2nd & 3rd Ichto players.

Just had to get Ursuppe's "next phase". It's certainly different enough. One game is not enough to give it an objective rating. Enjoyed playing it though. Second play with 3 didn't work as good as with 4. Probably best with 5. Rules don't feel so logical as with Ursuppe. Not as much fun as Ursuppe either, but still ok.

NL: Tactisch spel met oertijd thema. Soort vervolg op Ursuppe. Het is de tijd dat de beesten vanuit het water het land opgaan. En jouw beesten moeten natuurlijk in de survival of the fittest in grotere getale overheersen. Met behulp van de juiste handige genen en andere strategien lukt dat wellicht, tenzij de vulkaan uitbarstingen of paniekaanvallen in je nadeel werken.

First impressions are rather good.  Different manner of thinking required for this one than many of my other games.  The different roles you play each turn interesting, as well as the staggered gene collecting rounds.

Fun game of area control, with the unusual mechanics of the first two players not getting any actions in each round.

We always play with the expansion (which adds a point to the rating), which means the new genes are very different each round.

Better with the full five players, but occasionally someone just doesn't get into the game before it's over.

An area-control game where players move dinosaurs onto one of twelve different islands; players with the most dinosaurs score points when that island is picked from a stack of tiles.  The game is enjoyable, but has a few down-sides: one player is forced to sit out each turn (as a "dummy"), the island that scores is relatively randomly picked, making strategizing difficult, and the game lasts a very long time (our 5-player game took 2.5 hours).  The mutation cards, while neat, also have the power to make individual players much stronger, which I could see unbalancing the game.  While I thoroughly enjoyed the game, I just don't think it was fun enough (and the points awarded weren't tied closely enough to player skill) to warrant the length of time it took.  So, while it's fun, I think I'd rather it were a bit shorter.

Interesting game where two players each round have nothing to do whilst the other players can take actions in order to maximise their scoring which in turn is controlled by the players who cannot act!
A very different game altogether and a lot of fun!

RATING: 8
A very enjoyable game, especially for five players. The Frank and Doris jumping mechanism on the score track makes amazing comebacks possible and keeps the score tight. The chaos introduced by the hidden choice makes this game less ideal for heavy strategists and can lead to kingmaking.

The rating is for 5 players.

To my opinion, this game is underrated because of many boardgamegeekers are comparing this title to Ursuppe.  I never played this other Doris&amp;Frank title, so my rating is purely based on my experience with this fantastic game: beautifull board and bits, excellent and novel mechanics, enough tactical options to keep me satisfied and most important of all: lots of fun!

RATING: 6.5
Area control game with creatures called ichtos. Unique system where 1 player secretly chooses scoring area, 1 player is dummy, and others take actions.  Genes are also bid for when anyone reaches a certain score on the scoring track. Neat game, but to do well in the game, one must make guesses on where their opponents will score. The length of the game and guessing aspect doesn't make this a popular choice in my gaming group.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.8
This game is a wonder to behold, with the detailed map and the colourful playing pieces.  The cards with the bright colours are printed really really well too.  Play consists of trying to get those Ichtos to dry land to breed, and the unpredictability of the draw combined with the special abilities of the genes makes this game playable over and over and over again.

This game started a little bumpy for us, but once we got use to the 3-player sequence of "active player chooses scoring area" "next player (dummy) does nothing" and last player takes actions, things moved along pretty smooth. I am not sure if we played the gene auctions correctly or the "panic" action, but ... it was fun just the same. Quality bits and pieces and SUPER art work. The cards come in both english and german, if you were wondering.

RATING: 6
It's area majority, not one of my favourite genres so there's an instant mark-down, but at least it's got an area-choosing mechanic that makes it semi-interesting to play. Basically, the first player chooses one area secretly (from a selection of 3), the second player does nothing, then the rest get actions which allow them to breed new dudes and move them into potential scoring areas, usually trying to guess where this turn's scoring area might be based on what hasn't scored yet this round and where the first player might be winning an area. The introduction of special action cards midway through the game (which are paid for by removing dudes from the board) spices up the end-game a bit, making actions more powerful. All in all, it's not too bad and it moves along smoothly enough but, with so many turns where you do nothing, the result seems a bit random and out of your control.

Compared to ursuppe there are not enough genes here to make it interesting. Also there is not enough player interaction for my liking. Better try "Evo" for a game using the same theme.

TRY Sept/06: Cool game, with a feeling of El Grande to it (and a touch of Trias too - same artist, same dinos, area control).  But the genetic mutations (purchased via auction) give players uniqueness to their turns, and the scoring mechanics (for which region scores) are quite different.

RATING: 8
An interesting game with strange mechanics. As with most Doris & Frank games, everything seems to work in a delightfully odd way.

It borrows a couple things from Ursuppe: jumping pieces on the point track, and unique ability cards. Other than that, Urland really mixes things up with a unique take on the area control formula. Much like my experience with Ursuppe, it took a few turns for the unusual mechanics to sink in.

The combination of cards can create some interesting synergies, and adds a lot of incentive to revisit the game. I like how you must bid for the cards using available ictos present on the board. Seems much more strategic than simply purchasing them in turn order as found in Ursuppe.

Urland is a finely crafted game with layers of strategy, tactical decisions, and second guessing. Artwork by Doris, the best in the business, and this may be her magnum opus (it's either this or Carcassonne). The artwork is cute, endearing and immersive without overdoing it. Two quirky and complex games that don't stray too far from the intentional light-hearted feel.

RATING: 7
This is the game I had hoped Evo would be. Although Evo can be fun after a fashion (for me), Urland just scratches my gaming itches much better. The name of the game here is area control, and although area control isn't a mechanic I'm ecstatic about, Urland does it right. You are trying to successfully evolve your own little species of Ichto, in the seas and on 12 different, numbered land masses. Players take turns in the following roles: Environment, Observer, and Ichto...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Cute and engaging while also challenging and replayable.  Great combination.
One reason I like this game so much:  there really isn't another game that shares the same mechanics.  In this game, you gain knowledge when you can't act; and you act without the benefit of gaining knowledge.  Definitely requires thinking ahead.

RATING: 7.5
This is a partically rough game where all of the evolutionary advancements are irritating in the other people's hands and your are never enough to get what you want done.  If you can get through the rules, this ends up being a crazy, fun system.  It certainly has no sympathy for the weak.Be prepared to do some advanced planning for when you have to sit out two turns.

At one point, I had rated Urland a 7.More recent playings tell me that what was an OK game back when hasn't aged well. Urland today feels klunky rather than innovative, and having two our of four or five turns consist of choosing from among three island scoring tiles (for on turn) and doing absolutely nothing (during the other turn) is definitely a mechanic that doesn't "play" so well 10 years after Urland was first published. I still find Ursuppe/Primordial Soup an interesting game, but I can't see myself playing Urland again in the future ...

This is a true gem. The components are great. I love the art on the cards. It is one of the most balanced territorial games ever. Also the theme blends really well with the game mechanics. Kudos to the designers for the genes. The ones that look broken the first time you see them are well balanced, and the ones that you think they are so-so, they are unexpectedly useful. Great game any way you look at it. There are so many elements that make this game intensive and open to so many strategies.   !!! Long Live the Ichtos !!!

RATING: 6
Although the mechanics of this game still feel fresh and original anno 2009, it is a bit too chaotic for my taste. Successfully guessing which island is going to be scored by the current "environment player" requires quite a bit of luck for the main part of a 5-player game. Too much luck considering the gamelength and downtime of my first play. The gene cards and wooden Ichtos are pretty cute though, and the game is easily explained. I am willing to give this another try, and it is certainly much better than its sibling "Ursuppe".

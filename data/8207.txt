GAME: Dungeoneer: Vault of the Fiends
RANK: 2505
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Need to play it few more times to see if we really like it. My son and I played it twice last night and found it interesting but not compelling. We weren't dying to play another round.

Edit: I raised the score from 6 to 6.5 because we have found that we do like the game. We went ahead and purchased the epic and legendary versions too and like them even more. Pretty good mechanics and the artwork is great.

For those days when there isnt enough time for Runebound or a little variety is needed. I like the art on the cards and the humor on some cards. 

Got this one after Tomb of the Lich Lord.

I also own Dragons of the Forsaken Desert and Den of the Wererats in this series.  Vault of the Fiends is the toughest of the three.  The Frankenstein's laboratory setting appeals and the map cards are nastily atmospheric.  Sadly the monsters are more odd than scary, not helped by below-par artwork. Ramalith the Dungeonlord is particularly disappointing.

The game is good but lack of necessary component: the dice, and  the counter. To buy this staff, you must use more money and time to fine the fit component to play the game.

Luck is the most necessary ability to play this game. If you don't have it, I suggest to concede in the early game.

I liked it, but remember some complaining about differing strengths of characters, and that being a problem.  Not to mention the last time I played it, we used some Blood Bowl miniatures for the characters, then a few days later, all those mini's were stolen from my car.  So there are some bad feelings here.

RATING: 7.5
Played this more than the other variant and yet have one that I have not played at all, this game is solid fun and a quick delve into the dungeon if that is what you are looking for. With solid mechanics and beautiful Denmark artwork this is actually very high on my to own list for any dungeon crawler loving gamer. My primary foe on this is a primarily Electronic gamer who does love some dungeon crawling, and it has in fact become a favorite of us both, its mechanics are that solid.

My solid advice on this besides buy it if you like the subject matter, is to invest in some sleeves for it, get some miniatures if you can for player pieces and set aside some time to enjoy this tidy little romp.

Updating the score, there are some plays in here that have not been documented, no indictment on the game, just me. I still really like this title and plan on finishing it out as much as possible as soon as I can, I will play this one and hope to introduce it to more as soon as possible!

I keep calling this "Volrath's Lab", which shows my original Magic the Gathering heritage.  I consider this set more exciting than the original.

I keep this game around for much the same reasons that I keep Tomb of the Lich Lord around, plus the pumpable monsters.  Having a new dungeon to explore also is a welcome change.

I tried to like it but it did not work... I love dungeoncrawling and games like Dungeonquest, Heroquest and so on, but this one could not impress me... Maybe it is just because we played it wrong (The rulebook is a MESS!) but many mechanics just felt more complicated than they needed to be and too abstract for the theme of the game (For example: Why is a hero able to explore a new area of the dungeon while standing completely somewhere else? Any many more things like this...

A great idea that doesn't always work. The cards are nicely done. There are a lot of things I really like about this game, but it definitely has some problems.

The real problem is that it is far too complex for a game that is supposed to be simple - there is just too much to keep track of.

I like this particular set the least of the 4 that I own. It is the most complex set of the lot (and the game is already too complex for what it is). Also, the theme of a mad scientist really doesn't fit in so well with the whole fantasy theme.

After many attempts of eeking a good game out of this, I have given up. The game is just too unbalanced and complex for what it is.

If you enjoy light, 'gotcha' dungeon crawls, you should at least read through the rules for this game (downloadable here, and from the publisher's web site). I have few complaints about this game - the only notable one being the implementation of the 'pumpable attacks' feature. Gameplay is much more fun with some of the variants published here on BGG and elsewhere.

I want to like it, i do like it actually, but i just don't get it. "Peril" grows fast enough for the big dangeroues critters be played too soon in the game, when the characters are weak still, so i've never seen a plot end... Beautiful cards and a neat system makes it a cool dungeon crawling though.

El joc té un GRAN fallo: no té mecànica 'compensatòria' pel que es queda endarrere i afavoreix al que va davant.
És a dir, si tens la sort que pots complir aviat les teves cartes de missió secreta, augmentes de nivell (guanyes velocitat, força i màgia) i pots avançar més ràpidament. Si localitzacions on complir les teves missions no surten, et menges els mocs i t'has de barallar amb tots per la comú.
Si no recordo malament, per BGG/BSK vaig llegir que solventaven això posant X missions públiques (no recordo si 3, o tantes com jugadors).

Played it for the first time.  A little fiddley, as we learned while playing, plus we were using an older rules set.  But we managed through it.  Not bad, but not great.  However, it never saw the table again, so away it went.
Because of my experience with AD&D, I always thought I'd like dungeon crawl games.  I am surprised to find that this just isn't true.

Mixing the first two sets might be enticing, but....don't! Until fully integrated campaign rules that link all the modules together come along I  would stick with the "pure" sets, or use the pre-game dungeon setup rules to avoid waiting endlessly for the right quest rooms. Apart of that the theme of each set is nicely realised, and it simply doesn't fit to have the frankensteinized fiends and undead roaming the same dungeon, really.

Worst rulebook I've ever read! Although it has only 8 sites and the rules are proper easy. Finally the solo rules and campaign rules are completely missing. You have to download them from the Truant website from the Dungeoneer 1 game

RATING: 7
Played twice. Fun game, best played by pre-building the dungeon (although you lose some of the 'exploration' aspect if you do this).  Otherwise, a player can get lucky with card draws.  The rules are definately written with a CCG mentality, which makes them a little obtuse.  Even has a cooperative variant, where it's a group of players against a single player (the 'Dungeonlord').

RATING: 7
See my comments about Tomb of the Lich Lord for my opinion on Dungeoneer as a whole. 

For Vault of the Fiends:

This standalone expansion adds a bit of complexity, but I think the quests and monsters are slightly more balanced than in Tomb of the Lich Lord. In this game there are effects that actually move the map cards around on the board, which is an interesting little twist (especially when one is trying to complete quests). And an "insane wizard's vault" theme is a nice complement to Tomb of the Lich Lord's more generic fantasy dungeon. If you enjoy any of the other Dungeoneer games, this one is an auto-purchase. 

Also, out of all of the decks, I think combining Vault of the Fiends and Tomb of the Lich Lord makes the most sense. Some of the later expansions tend to have a distinct feel of their own, but the first two games can mesh quite well together.

Ray. Regalo 2014

Dungeon Crawler con cartas y unos pocos marcadores que ademas el juego no trae de serie. 

La ambientacion y las mecanicas son algo mas flojas que otros dungeons de tablero, pero bastante consistentes, y el juego constituye un serio reto, viniendo de una caja pequeña y con practicamente nada mas que cartas. 

Su punto a favor son las dosis de "puteo" debido a que todos los jugadores comparten el papel de "malo" (dungeoneer) en cada uno de sus turnos, añadiendo un componente a la partida no presente en otros juegos del genero. 

En mi opinion su principal defecto es de materiales. necesita marcadores que no vienen y los marcadores de personaje son francamente mejorables. y no me refiero a que falte plastico: andor, eldritch y galactica utilizan marcadores de carton para los personajes y no les pongo ni un pero.

The same comment as for the Tomb of the Lich Lord:

"Decent fantasy game in which you level up your character, gather equipment and skills, face monsters and complete quests.

It's not an overly long game and aimed mainly at delivering fun.
The mechanics is not sophisticated, but gets the job done.

I wouldn't recommend joining different parts of the Dungeoneer series as the game would be too long and random (you can mix adventure cards for more variety, but not map/mission cards)."

EDIT: The second and the second best entry in the whole 'Dungeoneer' series.

A decent game, but it takes a play or two to really learn all of the mechanics well.

It has the benefit of fairly good solo rules.

RATING: 9
When it comes to dungeonbashing, this is the best of the pack. The best comparision I can give, is blending Dragon Quest with cardgames like Vampire or Werewolf. You have a hero, equip and level him while walking through a dungeon created during play. To win the game you must solve 3 quests, drawn random each game. The cards are beautifully drawn, and often with a humourus comment that brings out laughter during the game. The game only grows in fun when expansions are added. One of my favorites of all time.

Exciting, fairly light and quick dungeon-crawl. This is getting regular plays. Downside is the possibility of being killed early on the game and having to wait for others to finish, but that's what beer/TV/console games are for.

We didn't have much fun with [thing=5576][/thing], but we got this game in the same trade we gave it a shot.  Not too surprisingly, it's more of the same so this version didn't click for us either---the gameplay was just too random and fiddly for us. The components of the new edition are definitely better, particularly the cards where you keep track of your stats, so I would recommend this version if you want to try it.

Dungeon exploration that could... but misses the boat a bit. It's an interesting game with some neat mechanism but it's too long and way too random to be real interesting. The rules are not that intuitive.

But the fact that there is other expansion available makes the game expandable and fresh.

RATING: 5
Not too crazy about this game.  All the players compete against each other by running around the dungeon trying to complete their individual quests.  I would have preferred it if the players acted together as a group. Back when this was made, co-ops hadn't really hit yet.

This ran out of steam pretty quickly. It seems to suffer the same fate that a lot of adventure/rpg games have and that is that they start out challenging and difficult but once you gain a few levels they become almost too easy. There has to be some way to have these scale a little better.

I did quite like the mechanism though and perhaps if I give it more of a chance it could move up in my ratings. I'm not sure I'll get much opportunity to do so however.

I really wanted to like this game, since the concept and artwork are fantastic. However, the rulebook (2nd edition) is the most ambigiously written collection of intentions I have seen in a long time. The "official" FAQ at the Atlas Games site does not correspond with the FAQ at the Yahoo-group, and the Yahoo-group itself covers 1600 questions alone(mostly about gameplay). In addition ,there is also the ATlas Games forum, AND an official "how to play the game" sheet.
Stay way from this one; it seems love at first sight, but wanes _very_ quickly.

Much the same as the base game but with a load of different cards.  I really need to get this out and give it another whirl to see how it pans out.  But there are so many other cool dungeon crawlers out there, and it's complicated enough to sit next to Castle Ravenloft in terms of complexity and length of play.  And it could never beat Castle Ravenloft.

AWEFUL AWFUL RULES!!!! They are quite vague, and don't cover enough detail on how the cards work.  Need technical writer to rewrite them.   Other than that, when you figure out how to play, fantastic game.  Analysis Paralysis prone for those who need to figure out all the premutations.  Really good game if you have people who can flush out the story and let it flow.  Rating varies wildly depening on people playing with.  Just make sure you appoint someone as a Dungeon Master to get rules clarifiactions.

RATING: 7.5
An extremely unique dungeon crawl that is a bit overly complex to understand initially thanks to a lackluster instruction manual, but interesting enough to warrant the learning curve.  Each Dungeoneer pack is its own little fantasy adventure conveniently tucked into a pocket sized case.  And I especially appreciate that all the Dungeoneer packs are self inclusive so that you can play any of them separately without having to buy a "core" starter pack.  (However, you will need 6 sided dice and some sort of counter tokens to play the game which you'll have to provide yourself.)  If you don't mind card based games Dungeoneer is definitely an experience you should at least try once.  Just be ready to deal with plenty of initial confusion before the fun starts.  This is a great game system but its simply not going to be everyone's idea of "fun".

Completely card-based dungeon romp that is always enjoyable to play. The amount of gameplay that is packed into such a small space is unbelievable (why can't more games take up so little storage space?!)

Luck-heavy but there are optional rules to help keep the balance (build map before playing, movement restrictions, etc.).

NOTE: Publisher's website has updated rules & FAQs which are definitely worth reading.

WARNING: Requires separate dice & counters (preferably red & green).

Another solid Dungeoneer pack.  A lot more "shifting" seems to go on in this game (that is, moving heroes and sites all around the board). It can lead to some interesting dynamics.  The mad scientist them is pretty interesting, and offers a break from the standard "undead" theme of Tomb.

Dungeoneer is a card-driven "dungeon" delving role playing game where players build the map, complete quests, and accumulate glory and peril as they traverse the map.  Glory is spent by the player to gain items and abilities for their own hero, while peril is spent by their opponents to cause them to overcome traps and face monsters.  Players always know how much peril and glory they have accumulated, thus they can know how much opposition they may face.  Each game is a standalone game but they can be combined.

Vault of the Fiends is set in a dungeon, and the heroes and  items are tune against fiends rather than other monster types.

RATING: 9
I loved the 1st edition Dungeoneer, and the 2nd edition is even better!  The 2nd ed changes a lot of little things, some of which didn't bother me in the 1st ed but which make the gameplay a lot better in 2nd ed.  I don't think any of the changes are for the worse.  The 2nd ed also includes a campaign game (which makes it more of an RPG, and includes a gamemaster).  The campaign rules are a little unclear and unbalanced, so I may need to make some minor changes.  Other than that, this is the best dungeon crawl game I have ever played.

A dungeon-crawler in card game format - although you do build up a game board with location cards.
I like the glory/peril mechanic, and the interaction between players you have thanks to the curse & monster cards you use against other players (thereby making a DungeonMaster/Overlord player redundant).
The illustrations look beautiful - which they need to, as they are the only medium in this game (no miniatures but thick paper foldups instead).

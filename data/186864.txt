Fantastic negotiation card game. Lots of insults, cajoling, and explosive laughter. Like a card based version of I'm the Boss, but immensely more satisfying.

The only downside is that it can go slightly long, but you can shorten it up by adjusting the end game card's placement.

Amazing negotiation and bluffing game.

8th Best Game 2017
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Probably the best small bluffing games I own. Great player interaction, lots of bluffing, backstabbing, competitive cooperation, shaky alliances and deception. Plays great at higher player counts, but also well with lower ones. It plays easily with non-gamers and gamers alike, which is a tough balancing act for many games. Highly, highly recommended.

For the simplicity on offer here, the amount of decisions and social dynamics available for what is effectively a card game, albeit one with economics and negotiations and bluffing, is enormous and also enormously fun. A confident 8, however could sneak a nine if I had the right group for it.

I had a chance to play it with the developer and I really enjoyed, so I went ahead and bought it. But when I played it with my group the flaws in the game became really obvious. The biggest fllaw in my oppinion is the lack of impact one person has combined with a rulset that does reward abusive behaviour. In the first few games we played with five people and basically the president would share the money between himself and the two same people, every turn. The other two tried to bribe the others and constantly voted with no or sent their agents out, but the existing arangement was just more lucrative, and the damage the agents did was not enough.  And for some reason the other two thought if they just could amass enough money, they would overthrow the president close to the end and get the edge over the others that way, but that hardly ever happened. Simillar paterns repeated constantly and the game became really dull after only a few rounds. I still would recommend the game, but either introduce a few house rules to make up for the missing ones, or really, really, REALLY make people aware on how to PROPERLY play it. Of course there are always people that push some rules to the limit in order to get an advantage over others, but a game should account for that. So I hope for improvements on the next game by this developer, because after all his game is really promising and CAN be fun if you play it with the right people.

Wow. This is a mean and dirty game - you constantly have someone's hand in your pocket and another at your throat. As many people remarked before, it condenses Junta to its core, and I find it very well executed.

賄賂をばら撒いて票を集めて儲けるゲーム。賄賂をあげたところで確約は得られないというゲームが多い中、このゲームは指示通りに投票した場合にのみ賄賂が渡されるという仕組みになっており、地に足のついたやり取りが可能である。

The budget phase from Junta blown up to a complete game. A good decision as this is the most fun part of Junta. A few added choices in the voting phase provide an enjoyable experience. It's still more of a social activity than a game. The right group of lively gamers is necessary, otherwise it will end up with the usual unsatisfying result that the quiet gamers will end up winning while the guys creating atmosphere will get hosed.

Ein Spieler ist Präsident und darf fünf zufällig gezogene Geldkoffer mit 1 bis 5 Millionen verteilen. Die Spieler stimmen dann ab, ob sie den Präsident unterstützen und das Geld einheimsen, ihn stürzen wollen und dadurch auch kein Geld bekommen, ob sie jemand erpressen/beklauen wollen oder sich dagegen schützen oder ob sie einmal kurz in die Staatskasse greifen. Auch Bestechung ist möglich, damit andere so abstimmen, wie man es gerne will. Wird der Präsident abgewählt, geht der Titel an den Spieler, der ihn zuerst stürzen wollte, weiter.

Got to play this and Junta the card game today and while both have the same core mechanic, I very much prefer this one as it destills the game down to the core and most interesting part of distributing the money and voting and with everyone getting the same options it is way less random and chaotic but brings up the interaction. 
MIght be a good and more portable alternative to Cash & Guns to bring along for game nights.

This game has everything I love at board games. You can bluff, lie, intimidate, anticipate, deceive... perfect! It's like intrigue light, it plays very quickly.
One player is the president and distributes money as he wants. The other players now can decide between 5 things. They can accept the distribution, decline and try to deselect the president.
They can also try to get money from the state (draw a money card). And they can steal money from other players or defend against that.
You can always make deals, threat the other players, don't comply to these deals etc...
HUGE BLAST!!!

The game takes the only reason why I would play Junta (the president distributes the budget and we vote on it), and packs it in a very nice 30 minute game. Instead of a whole 4 hour game, to give you reasons to distribute the budget in a particular way, it ads a few simple but clever mechanics, to make negotiations interesting.
We liked this a lot! If you have the slightest interest in negotiation games, I highly recommend this!

Close to pure voting political mind game simply divvying up unevenly distributed cash amongst players.  Take turns as president, voting on the split, and optionally using special cards to change the results.

Reworking of AD/Morgenland boardgame.  Captures all main elements of boardgame but plays quicker.  Passing the palace guard is simplified, artifacts are single use.  Includes two player option.  Good fun.

A Breese with some pedigree, though I've never played the original - somehow the only RB design I missed on release and have never caught up on - but this makes me want to.  It's a pretty light game , with a few chaotic elements but not as random as that perhaps makes it sound.  You certainly need to use your few actions each turn well and keep your eye on the ball if you're to win.

How did I not know about this game sooner?

Aladdin's Dragons is a tremendously entertaining blind bidding game, but is getting difficult to find and slightly more expensive than I would like. This card version appears to offer 90% of the gameplay in a portable package that is 10% of the size (and at a much lower cost).

Differences? Fewer spaces on the virtual board, fewer cards you can use to bid/bluff with, and slightly fewer options you need to be concerned with. While this sounds like a lot of subtraction it also makes the game quicker and more focused.

Consider me sold.  A definite keeper.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (December 2014)

I generally love Richard Breese's games but I'm a bit disappointed with Aladdin's Dragons. 

I really like the blind bidding but the uncontrollable luck in the spells deck turn me off to the game. There are lots of gratuitous 'take that's spells that prevent me from really planning.

Ok art and components.

Bottom line, I would like to give the game another chance, perhaps I will read the rules as I´m not really sure we played it correctly.

Quick blind auction/worker placement style card game about getting the treasure from the dragons so you can bribe the guard and steal the artifacts from the palace! Nicely done, but the spells and artifact powers make it somewhat more complex and nasty than you expect.

If you would need the same sized rulebook only for explaining the artefacts and the spells and especially timing questions, then something is wrong. One big example with those cards being used would have helped the game probably a lot. So you always discuss, what happens and how it happens. The boardgame is much clearer

A fairly quick card game which should be more entertaining than it actually is. There seems little point in fighting over the treasure in the dragon's caves locations when the game is won by the number of artifact cards alone.

I like games which involve figuring out what other people have chosen to do whilst trying to stop them figuring out what you have done (Citadels and Basari fall into this group.)

RATING: 6.5
Well, I haven't played the board game in many many years. However, from what I remember, the card game is almost exactly the same except that I think it plays even faster. It is much more compact, too, although not as pretty! Players start with a hand of money cards (1-5 in different colors). Each round, place cards face down, one by one, to bid on several areas: additional money cards, spells, artifacts. At each location, only the high bidder wins (cards revealed after all bids placed). To get to the artifacts, though, you must pay a bribe to the guard (random strength). Artifacts and spells provide several single-use bonuses. The game ends after several rounds (once through the artifact deck?) and the player with the most lamp artifacts wins.

I'm not normally a fan of blind bidding games, but I think it was less of a problem here (and in its parent game, and Ys) because bids are made incrementally and you have some basis on which to build your decisions. Of course, the fact that I won my first play may be biasing me positively! I'm not sure I'd try too hard to get it, but I certainly wouldn't mind playing it again!

This isn't going to replace the Aladdin's Dragons board game (which I like quite  a bit) for me, but it does an admirable job of translating the basic idea and mechanics of the board game into a much faster, lighter card game. The spell cards are disappointing on two levels. First, several are so underpowered as to be not worth bidding on, and second, anything that's is worth playing is going to be countered, as there are three artifacts that cancel spells and probably only eight spells in total that will be distributed before game end. So, not perfect, but quick, interesting and very faithful to the core mechanics and "feel" of the board game, All in all, a success and worthy of a few plays even if not destined for greatness.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
In my opinion (and to me that's all that really matters right?) this is one of the best small game conversions from a big board game. I'd say somewhere in the top 3 really. San Juan, Caylus Magna Carta and Aladdin's Dragons. It implements the blind bidding aspect of AD perfectly and brings the play time down to where it needs to be. Just a superb game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I've already written a bit about Keydom and its offspring Aladdin's Dragons, but now the offspring have had offspring in the form of the Aladdin's Dragons Card Game. I know I'm on the record as generally opposed to the very idea of card game versions of board games (such as the Tigris & Euphrates Card Game, Caylus Magna Carta, Settlers of Catan Card Game, San Juan, and Cardcassonne), but this may be the exception that proves the rule. I have actually enjoyed my two plays of the Aladdin's Dragons Card Game thus far and am looking forward to trying it again. I now think that the results of card game conversions inherently depend on the underlying essence of the original game. In most cases that essence is lost in the translation and the card game ends up being a neutered version of its inspiration. Settlers is a negotiation and trading game, so the card game rips the heart out of the game. Caylus revolves around the tension between short-term tactical gains and the long-term benefits of the favor track; Caylus Magna Carta discards the favor track and consequently discards any chance at being worthwhile. Tigris & Euphrates and Carcassonne are tile-laying games, so removing the tiles is just downright illogical. Aladdin's Dragons, on the other hand, is a blind bidding game. It turns out blind bidding is not only suited to the card game format, but maybe even better suited than to the board game format. I think the Aladdin's Dragons Card Game may be even better than the likes of Ys or Aladdin's Dragons because it speeds up a game and mechanic that suffers when it drags, and needs to move at a good pace to keep everyone engaged. This is a case where the card game version looks to actually be improving upon the heart of the game, rather than removing it.

I like the board game, but unfortunately this seemed to suck the fun out of it. I think this is primarily due to the small number of rounds - likely no more than 4 in a 4-5 player game. Since like its parent it is a blind-bidding game, some players can get badly hosed on a round or two. With enough rounds it is possible to recover from this (and it might well happen to everyone at some point, making things more equitable). In 4 rounds it is not really possible to recover. 

It doesn't help that the space that allowed players to trade gems is gone. I would rather have kept that and gotten rid of the spells. The spells theoretically add interest to the game, but are too swingy - if not canceled they are too powerful for a game this short, if they are then the players getting them are wasting cards.

Blind bidding game, where you place your bid cards one by one in various areas to attempt to win cards. Major bluffing opportunities, as the two cards I placed might only be a 1 and a 2, whereas your single 3 already outbids me. Do you have the guts to think your 3 bid will stand up, or will you supplement your bid now that you see my 2 cards there?

Once you collect treasures, you need to use those to buy artifact cards, again using the same process. Interestingly, the bid you use to win an area becomes your price. So, if you big high to win an area, you set the price high, causing you to spend more. Special cards throw some quirks your way, as they can cause bids to be manipulated, adding to your bid, halving even numbered bids, etc.

The game is listed as 3 to 5 players, but the 2 player variant in the manual works just fine.

This is a curious game where the main strategy is spreading yourself among several different areas of the game in order to be the first to get the most of a particular type of good.  I don't do well at these types of games, which makes for a minor strike against it, but I can see how other people would like them.  It's difficult for me to judge how to spread myself among all the different regions at a time, but I know other people appreciate the challenge.  I understand that this is a very faithful adaptation of the board game to an affordable (and easy to find) card game, so that's another positive aspect to the game.

Na anderhalf jaar eindelijk kunnen spelen. Leuk spel waarin het blinde bieden uiteindelijk tot onverwachte verrassingen kan leiden.

Als speler probeer je zoveel mogelijk artefacten te verzamelen. Hiertoe moet je schatten zien te verkrijgen uit de drakengrotten. Deze schatten heb je nodig om de artefacten te kunnen kopen in het paleis. Maar pas op voor de paleiswachter, want die kan daar nog een stokje voor steken.

Het is een leuk en snel spel. Door het blinde bieden kunnen er wel situaties ontstaan waarin spelers niet hun ideale strategie kunnen volgen. Maar dat kan ook gewoon onervarenheid zijn.

Never played the original, but I am definitely no fan of blind bidding.  The gameplay itself is fine, although I do agree the spell cards do seem to add a big does of randomness due to their effects (with very little cost).  Didn't do much for me.

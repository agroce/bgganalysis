Medium rating after one co-op play.  Need more plays to really be sure.  Theme really holds strongly in the game. In co-op more, as you bump the difficulty level you need to really start working more together.   Sound mechanics. Events introduce randomness which increases replayability

Better than K2 but somehow worse as well.

I like the ressource system but the cooperative version which we played was rather dull. The competetive game will be better, for sure, but still nothing that turns my world upside down.

Picked it up at Spiel 2017. Both the designer and one of the volunteers got me really hyped about this game. I'm not disappointed. Right now I have only played it in two player co-op. The design is solid and the mechanics work very well together for a unique game. I can imagine it being more exciting with more players and in competitive play, but we will find out soon.

Met the designer and got a chance to try a demo of this game at GenCon '16.

Tried the game in both co-operative and competitive modes and had an absolute blast in both modes. 

The rules are simple and well-designed. The strategy is engaging. The artwork is beautiful. There's a decent amount of "easter egg" humor designed into the game as well as opportunities for many laugh out loud moments during gameplay. 

As another user has mentioned, this game feels like an absolute complete package in both modes.

After playing the game that afternoon at GenCon, I immediately backed the KickStarter as did everyone else at the table. I can't recommend this game enough.

RATING: 4
The Coop mode was roll and move.  It was as dull as shoots and ladders.  It is strange as there were a lot of provisions made for coop mode.  Use other side of the board and a special deck.  Was a nice production.  

I suspect competitive mode is much different and wish I had time to try it.  I'd be willing to try again but for now based on coop the game is a thumbs down

Totally random pile of crap. Includes such wonders like missing a turn and player elimination. Never playing again. Would rather play snakes and ladders.

RATING: 9
*Edit* I now have my copy of the game and it did not disappoint! So far, I have only played it competitively on the easiest setting, but it was a lot of fun! So much potential for replay-ability!
The only criticism I have and the reason why it doesn't get a 10 is due to the complexity of the rule book making it a bit of a harder sell to my friends. All versions of the game were bundled into one rule book which can be is a bit confusing at first. But once you get past that, I've had no problem convincing people to play!  

I was lucky enough to play this at Spiel 2016. I love a game where the theme and mechanic work well together and it certainly does in this one. The tension created by not knowing who you can trust along with the realisation that you are slowly running out of food/oxygen is just brilliant. I enjoyed it so much I promptly purchased the premium version which comes with a co-op/solo expansion.

RATING: N/A
While I don't relate at all on the theme of this Kickstarter game it caught my eye instantly.  
The art work looks quite nice, the mechanics presented are quite intriguing.
I love how it is a tile laying game which involves a Karma track to adjust your score rating. 
Quite optimistic about this game and hopefully will get to play it early 2017.

Lots of moving parts and thoughtful, well made, components. Summit ages well too as you play it more and find out how best to use karma cards in the competitive mode. Also, the designer is engaged in the forums and is just an all-around nice guy.

Hard to describe, kind of Carcassone (tile laying) meets Snakes & Ladders (there's usually a few snake moments) meets Arkham Horror (character, equipment and resource management).  There's quite a lot of potential 'take that' but it's optional and you can remove the worst of it. Quite a few aspects as similarly customisable, such as difficulty.
My version came with co-op and competitive, although I'm only likely to play competitive, it's nice to have the option.
The production values are excellent - the tokens, tiles and player boards are super chunky and everything else is of a high quality. The removable tile tray was a great idea.

Looks like it is harder to get into than it is. The game play is fast and good. My only complaint is the rule book. It is not the easiest to read, but the designer has placed YouTube channels that walk you through the set up and initial play. Highly recommended for solo, PvP, Co-Cop funness (real word).

I was so hyped and then I played it at Essen Spiel 2017. It seemed so meaningless and boring. Basically a very simple tile laying games with a good chunk randomness thrown in. I can't imagine how bad the co-operative version must be. The competitive one felt flat for the whole group (5 people). The artwork is neat and the designer a really nice guy but sorry, 70-80 â‚¬ for that game is way overpriced.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

If you don't mind the luck of the draw doing you in to some degree and that not all card draws are created equal, this game can create a fascinating  narrative. There are karma cards which can be downright nasty and which an opponent played perfectly to take me out from reaching the summit before everyone else. While one drops on the karma track for being nasty, it felt to me there was plenty of ways to bring your karma back up fairly easily. My climber also got hit with a random event of frostbite which reduced my movement by one for over half the game as I didn't want to potentially waste a turn or two rolling a die to remove the condition (there are also some cards which someone else can play to assist you in some cases but no one did)*.  It is an interesting racing game involving placement of different  climbing tiles which require different types of equipment. All in all, a game I am happy to play but likely do not need to own.

=========

* I incorrectly stated earlier that you could not remove it which was factually incorrect.

This game has it all!

Reversible board for competitive or solo/cooperative modes.
Trackable player cards, as your resources go up or down(food, oxygen, items) your weight and moment changes.

Easy to play! As each player ends their turns, events are triggered and so are weather conditions. Never the same game!

RATING: 8
This is a fun game with innovative tile mechanics and an interesting theme. Two things elevate it above similar games: 1 - while it is a "race", victory is points-based, and measured at checkpoints and in other ways, and 2 - the Karma track, which is thematically interesting, another route to scoring, and does a great job of managing potential kingmaker issues that might exist otherwise. Unlike many racing games, these both help you stay in the race - and FEEL like you're still in the race - even if you are hopelessly behind. (Haven't played co-op/solo modes yet but glad the options are there.)

I've had the chance to play test play this game a few times in several stages of it's development. I have most recently test played it last week at a local game shop. There are so many cool and unique game mechanics in Summit that work seamlessly together. Summit is a thoroughly enjoyable and challenging game experience. 
The creator has brought Thunder Bay's finest illustrator and graphic designer on board to bring his ideas to life. 
I can't wait to see the finalized product on my game table!  If you haven't already seen the Kickstarter campaign for this game make sure to check it out!

Played it at Spiel 2016. We had a great laugh and (un)fortunately had pretty much plain sailing to the top and back. The mountain didn't get us on that day, although they tried to shuffle the pack multiple times, even bad events we were able to turn in to good fortune.

Scored a pretty decent 90 points and although I love the idea, and can see it becoming a beautiful game (the prototype components were a bit flimsy, understandably) I have a hard time paying 84 canadian dollars (including shipping) for what basically boils down to a tile laying game with some fresh mechanics. I would gladly pay 45 euros for it, but that would be my maximum price.

There is not enough component value in the box for me to give it a higher rating than a 7 considering it's price. I hope it will reach our shores (Europe) someday and get to regular stores, and perhaps then I can buy it and give the rating it deserves (in my opinion about an eight and a half, if the components of the final version are any good).

Great idea, fun game, original execution and fresh mechanics, unfortunately too expensive for Europeans.

I've played this game several times and can't say enough great things about it. I love a thematic game, and Summit does such a great job of capturing the mountain climbing theme through the artwork, with the many items you can use, the thoughtful and unpredictable event cards, and most impressively with the player mats that are used to track resources.  Resources are one of the many things that can make or break you in the game, and it is a constant battle between stocking up and being prepared for the mountain (and your opponents!) or packing light and going for a speedy ascent. The karma track is also a great addition that helps to keep the game close and adds to the tension of the race by creating some interesting dynamics between the players (Do I help my opponents to gain points or hinder them to take the advantage in the race? Or can I make a deal to help a player only if they promise to help me later in return? And can I trust them?). There is a lot to consider and balance, and while this gives you a lot of control over your fate in the game, it adds to the stress and will leave you thinking about the outcome for days after playing. All in all, a really enjoyable experience and one I can't wait to get back into again soon!

Kickstarted. Premium version with Yeti expansion. Great game of tile placement and event drawing. Movement points are based on the weight and you are restricted by how much you're carrying and your overall health. An injured character loses movement points and carrying to much gear makes weights you down. Plays great and the random tile draw each turn and the event cards always make for a unique experience climbing the mountain.

Backer Edition. Got in a couple cooperative rounds with my wife and we really enjoy this one! VERY excited to play it over the holidays with family and friends. The event cards. resource management, and climbing tile variety add a lot of strategy to the game. I came within one tile of the summit before an avalanche hit and I had to work my way down, or try to reach the summit and probably die! Wonderful sturdy box with very well designed inserts. Quickly rocketed up my list of favorite games to play.

RATING: 8
I had the opportunity to participate in the play testing sessions for this game at the local game store with designer Conor McGoey. The play mechanics of the game are simple enough to get into the game quickly while still being complex enough to offer plenty of opportunity for strategic play.

The resource management system in the game takes a refreshing approach where you are open to taking whatever you like/need but penalised for over burdening yourself, instead of merely attempting to accrue as much as possible.
There is a good amount of player interaction over the course of the game where you feel you can definitely impact what other players are doing, no one person is going to sit around playing solitaire. Meanwhile, there aren't the many situations you find where one player can be completely locked out of the game through the actions of the rest of the table, everyone always has a chance.

There were some minor concerns regarding the power of positive karma actions in comparison to negative karma, where negative karma was not a viable playstyle due to the number of ways you were punished by it. This was a relatively minor flaw however and discussion with the designer have said that corrections were put in place prior to the general release.

This rating is based purely on the mechanical merits of the game and it's overall entertainment value as a game, because I have not played a retail copy yet I cannot include any information regarding the quality of the items included in the game.

When I obtain my own copy I will update this with further information.

Played competitive. Game was just way, way too long. Due to some of the bad events that came out early in the game, our session turned into a four-and-a-half-hour slog. I got a chunk of points in the first half of the game and just coasted for the rest of the game, and I still won. I just wanted it to end already. A long, super-boring ordeal that just wasn't any fun.

GAME: Arctic Front
RANK: 3166

RATING: 9
Very good and tense game. Not a lot of strategy in the North due to the géography. The Soviets must go for a breakthrough in the first turn or lose the game.

RATING: 8
Game 3 in the Third World War series. Often gets a low rating from gamers. Maybe it's because this is a difficult game to play. Tough terrain, few opportunities for manoeuvre and the fact that if your initial strategy doesn't work you have little chance to recover may bias people against it. However, this game is one of the most interesting of the Third World War series for exactly those reasons, whether played on its own or as part of a combined setup with the other games in the series.
The addition of the Soviet Strategic Reserve and the famed 'Blackjack' bomber to the force pool give a Soviet player more options in the combined game, whereas in the stand-alone, they provide a real insight into what *might* have happened.
Definitely a must if you own any of the other games, worth a look as a stand-alone, or as intro into the series.

RATING: 8
Worthwhile addition to the TWW series, adding not only the northern flank but also soviet strategic reserve units for use in the campaign game. Standalone, it is perhaps the 'lightest' of the four, and I'd agree that Nordkapp is better choice for anyone looking for a game specifically on this subject - but then I'd argue Nordkapp is a better game than most, period, so I'm not taking anything away from Arctic Front on that score.

Probably my favourite game of the series.  Most manageable of them if you've only got one night to spare.  Good game balance.  Have never yet seen either side achieve more than a marginal victory.

Playable in an evening unlike its german front brother, and very good for its time. One of the first wargames I owned and I played it a lot - on sober reflection it only rates a 7.5 because it cries out to be linked to a naval module (I have been working on a version with 2nd Fleet). Also victory is usualy determined in how far the Soviets can advance in the first two turns (after which they tend to be bottlenecked) which is highly dependant on weather, the naval control dice roll and the mobilisation rolls.

Third World War Series #3

RATING: 7.5
The initial Soviet para and marine landings in Norway are great fun, but NATO should be able to contain these. The forces of both sides can get bogged down in the mountains, but the option for the WP player to bypass through Sweden is there.
In the combined game, NATO can put more aircraft into this theatre and so challenge for air superiority. A very playable game from the TWW series, with a lower counter density. Simple to learn and fun to play.

RATING: N/A
Arctic Front: more the "forgotten front" that never was.  Probably the least strategic, in terms of military importance, of this fine series.  While the land battle may have had some impact in securing airfields to extend range over the GIUK gap the "real war" here would have been at sea.  Play with 2nd Fleet (VG) and change NATO/Soviet airbase ownership/status depending on land combat results.

Of the 4 games in the Third World War series, this is probably the "weakest" in terms of scope, the gameplay is the same brilliance but I can see some squawk at the relative size and length of the game.  Never the less, its still a great game and a great demonstration of the robustness of the system, which copes equally well with the extreme environment and still bring out the environment's favor without any chrome!  When link together, this theater is a bit of a side show for some bonus points since the bulk of the points are on the Europe and Persian map, but it's still tempting to spend a little resource for the seemingly easy pickings... but at what cost in the other theater?

Low counter density, probably the lowest of the "Third World War" series IIRC.  Easy to play in one sitting, unlike the other two games.  Any game that brings in the Swedes and Finns has go to be good, though it probably underestimated Finnish full mobilization.

Good: Strategic/Operational - WW III - Medium

Plus:
-Same great system as the mother game
-Great what if situation

Minus:
-As stand alone okay, as extension of the main game it's great

Nice addition to the main game but as stand alone not as interesting as the battle for Germany but still a great what if situation!

Sold it.

I footnoted this one in my undergraduate thesis (Norwegian Grand Strategy and NATO's Northern Flank). Good at highlighting some of the issues of this important theater, very different from the central front (e.g. important, militarily robust neutrals, Norway's unique geography, and the interplay of air, land, and sea forces).

RATING: 8
has the lowest counter density of the games in this series. This is a good one for learning the rules as you mostly focus on the tactics without having to worry about a grand strategy.

RATING: 9
Probably the most manageable TWW gamette to play on its own. It makes for a tense game that way, but you should allow the Pact player the option to commit the strategic reserve, should he become bottled up in the mountain passes.

RATING: 8
As with Southern Front, best as part of a combined game with that and Third World War.  Good with 2 or 3 players on a side when all are combined.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Somewhat less compelling than the parent game, Third World War, mostly due to the terrain limitations of a rocky, coastal slugfest southward by the Soviets. However, I have no trouble thinking the Soviets would make the ports access of Scandinavia the primary focus of the hostilities. So the strategic reserve commitment, and subsequent invasion of Neutral Sweden, does improve the game. Still the same great system as TWW, fewer units, unique theatre. Great to combine with TWW, too. Very nice addition!

The GDW TWW series is probably the best WW3 system overall.  This one though is almost a vignette - IMO best played as an adjunct in joint play with the other games, or as a solo exercise.

Tense and fun in his own, it's even better when played in conjunction with the other games of the serie. It aptly copnveys the sense of wilderness and logistic (and operational) constraints of the batle in the deep north. Opening the norther flank is a dream for the soviet player and a nightmare for the NATO one.

Great playable system, only gripe is that it gets very congested around Narvik with those 1RE stack arctic mountain passes and luck of dice roles takes over from strategy. Pact needs to use airmobile, para and marines to best advantage. The most fun way to play is to combine with Battle for Germany and attack Sweden with the Strategic Reserve and the Soviet/Polish Baltic marines.

This game system is better than the rating for this particular game.  I'd rate this higher, but the fact is this game is restricted in its options even when the Soviets choose to invade Finland and Sweden.  Terrain is the obvious culprit as it forces the Soviet attack into a very narrow channel that can easily be constricted even more by average NATO play.  I'm sure this opens up a bit more if played alongside the other games in the series, but by itself it plays fast but does not offer players much variability.

Feb 2011 Update : when played with other modules, this front really is a bastard child.  Soviet air and land reinforcements go to Germany.  Not enough VPs to gain to really commit to the fight.

My favorite of the TWW expansions.  It adds a lot of tension to the central front conflict with the potential redirection of reinforcements (especially the single counter NATO units).  This is also the side theater I most enjoy playing by itself.

RATING: 7
The Third World War game system is one of the best I have come across and is easy enough to remember - after a few games. I have reduced my rating of this game after a few recent plays. The Norwegian front is so limiting that all games seem to end the same way. I have also never really worked out how the Soviet Divisions of three brigades are supposed to cross the wilderness hexes. Still, it is an interesting study and will get played from time to time.

Weakest of the Third World War games and considerably more luck dependent (Sweden neutrality could be huge).

Nice game with board that needs a bit of tape to hold it together so that it plays well.  The holder for the little barrels need to be glued together.  Easy to teach - kind of a gateway game.

Underrated, a fun and quick game with a lot of decisions to be had.  5 might be a tad chaotic, but 3-4 is probably the sweet spot.  Great game, one of the better of Essen 2007.

I was very tired when I played this, so I probably need to play again and see if my rating adjusts. It's a unique game, but a little fiddly, and a little frustrating. I wished I had more control during the game, but made a lot of stupid mistakes that would have made it more manageable. I think it is too tactical for me, but I will give it another shot. UPDATE: played again, I think I am done with this one. I might consider it as a two or three player game, but I would have to be pretty bored to give it another shot.

I was attracted to Darjeeling for the theme, since one of my dream jobs is to be a "teaman": importing and blending teas. And I'm afraid I was disappointed: the theme is there, but it's fairly weak.
Which is too bad, since I'm sure the theme has turned off a lot of people, and the thin veil of theme is draped over fantastic and rather unique game mechanics! Especially the "demand barometer". 
This is a hidden gem! It's all about when to ship and (to a lesser extent) what to ship. If you've experienced a run away leader problem, then you've been playing it very, very poorly. Run away leader in front of you? Then ship...ANYTHING! A very tense game whose ending can hit you very suddenly. Far, FAR more tactics than strategy in this one. A great deal of things to ponder on any mid to end game move.

Rules-wise Darjeeling is simple enough to be a family game, though it's maybe a bit abstract and gamey to be a hit in that role.  As a sort of super filler for gamers, it works quite well.

As others have noted, timing when and what colours you will score is entirely the game.  The more players, the harder that becomes as you struggle to remember what everyone else is collecting and to predict when they will cash in.  There are also decisions to be made about where to move and how many v.p.'s to squander on it, but I didn't find these particularly interesting.  There is some fiddliness with scoring every turn, tile replacement and setting aside tiles that have just been scored.  However, the game rattles along at a good pace with little down time.

I haven't played with 2 or 3 players, but would guess that Darjeeling is probably best with the lower numbers as this would make planning easier and minimise the chaos of carefully assembled shipments whizzing to the bottom of the multiplier track.

Some clever ideas.  The demand barometer in particular.  Nice design and the leader can change frequently.  However play - tile collecting - is quite constrained and the scoring boats mechanism leaves a negative feeling.  Would play again but would not seek out.

This is a pretty amazing set collection game that I'm surprised I missed.  I absolutely love the demand mechanism with the rolling barrels and the boats shifting in the harbour.  I absolutely adore this wonderful take-that game.

RATING: 6
I was initially enamored with Darjeeling and thought it viable as a SdJ contender. After a few more plays, the game lacks a certain level of spark.
The main culprit? The rhythm of the game is a bit odd with the bulk of the scoring occurring at the beginning of one's turn. 

The game is all about generating momentum at the right time(s). The timing of these momentum spurts is very difficult to optimize and is very dependent on what other people do. What can be optimized is the collection of tea crates. This level of optimization is possible and should put you in contention but will not guarantee a win. Optimizing the collection of tiles can be interesting but it's somehow not all that much fun.

Rating unlikely to go up, may go down.

I find it quite enterteining and original in its concept.  It is quite easy and familiar.  The bits are good quality, and the scoring system is new.  I found it as a real race to get 100 points.  Sell at the right moment the right kind of tea.  The box is much too big.

The setup time is the most taxing part of this game, but once you are into it, it's a pretty smooth playing game of set collection and route planning. Very easy to get yourself stuck away from the tiles you need if you are not paying attention!

This is a nice family strategy game with a game weight of 2 out of 5. It teaches easily and plays at a brisk pace. I don't think it's a good gateway game, but it's a great super-filler/light game for gamers. My only criticism is that there is a lot that has to be managed on the board at the beginning of [b]each[/b] person's turn, which includes scoring, passing the bag, and replacing the tea crate, rather than just managing the board when someone scores. I dock this game a full point for this. Other than that, I really like it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is an interesting combination of mechanics, but it almost feels like it plays itself.  That is because many of the decisions are rudimentary and you're really just seeding a machine that will hopefully crank out points for you.  The endgame feels a bit anti-climactic as someone just hits the max number of points and wins, but everyone can see it coming.

Mid weight game with good integration of theme, an elegant demand pricing mechanism and overall a very pleasant experience. The group as a whole needs to cooperate to keep large loads from the x3 multiplier for any length of time or you will get a runaway leader, 100 points is not far away at all.

Interesting.  A different mechanic in regards to scoring where you can score off of one play a few times if it works right for you (less people shipping).  Want to play again as there is more going on in this one that meets the eye.

RATING: 6
Pretty good abstract in which timing is very important.  I'm not sure if I like the multiplier mechanism... but without it, there's not much of a game here.  In my plays with novices (including myself), a lucky player gets mad points from the x3 multiplier ship for several turns after several people simultaneously blow their wads to try to take that x3 spot.  I think experience will solve this issue since strategic players will hold single crates for quick deliveries that knock down the person who is scoring mad points.

** UPDATE: I love the puzzle and race aspects of this game, but players must work together to keep everyone in check or else there seems to be a runaway leader problem.

Not my cup of tea. An abstract with the theme tacked on - move your meeple around collecting tiles, trade them in at optimal time for vps, and if possible rely on others to make sub-optimal deliveries to knock the leader down from the prime vp generating slot. Pretty dull playing, at least it is quick.

There can be huge runaway leader problems. If you do not complete crates early, you will not catch up unless you complete very large numbers of crates that score multiple times. This is a light weight family game. Not overly engaging for the hardcores but may be decent as a gateway or rare filler.

Decent set collecting type game where it seems like the timing of cashing in your sets is everything.  I'm not able to pay enough attention to what other players are doing to know the best time to cash in my sets, however, so it felt fairly random to me.  I think a good memory of what other players have collected would help a lot in this game.  Still, it was an enjoyable game that I wouldn't mind playing from time to time.

A tactical race game were you have to consider quite a few conflicting elements as you race to 100 points. Should you go for lots of small shipments or a few big ones? Should you be going for the crates with more demand which everyone else is also going for? The chaos created by play does seem to make it a little unsatifying when the big shipment you made gets pushed down the score multiplier track immediately. It is kind of like a more complicated version of "Hey, that's my fish!"

(Given a single initial go at two players.) Darjeeling has been on my radar as a faint blip because of the catchy name: I happen to like tea, and my significant other is an avid collector. Therefore it made sense in some weird way to give this game a go. It is learnt very quickly, even from the rules. When playing, Darjeeling turns out to be a fast-paced abstract at heart with some interesting mechanics. Players create partial tea creates on a playing area, and have the option of delivering a bunch of them once they are able to 'puzzle' them togehter into complete crates. They get a small bonus for delivery; the real meat is in occupying high-multiplier barges until it is the player's turn again. With just two players it is a bit of a race, and I can imagine that things get really, really nasty once the number of players goes up. It's not what I and my girlfriend were expecting, but we were charmed in a certain way, so we've decided to put it on our wishlist. Hopefully there'll be a good offer one of these days; the game is quite expensive, even for German standards! (By the way, this the umpteenth title of Abacus being more than meets the eye: I gotta keep an eye out for this label in the future.)

[b]Update[/b] Several years have passed since I wrote the above, and I was able to play the game anew with a lot more game experience under my belt. Frankly, I wonder where the attraction had lain back then. Once a player manages a good score on the barges the pressure is on the rest to kick him off of the highest multiplier spaces ASAP, otherwise it’s simply too difficult to reel him in. This promotes small groups of crates being formed, but then the game lasts forever. It looks like the players are stuck between a rock and a hard place; and then perhaps the only meaningful decision to make is not to play this game at all. It’s too bad, really: the core idea really isn’t too bad.

Nice game with interesting mechanics on the bonus system. Biggest gripe is that the box is huge (wide rather than high) and it just doesn't fit nicely on the shelf.

Half set-collection, half market-timing - not bad. I've seen it claimed that the game really shines if you play to 200 points, and I can believe it, though I haven't yet tried it to see if the strategic increase merits the extra time.

But: very, very repetitive, without any real sense of arc.

The theme is near flawless in this one, which is part of the reason I like it so much. It is smooth, quick, and elegant. The only thing I didn't really like was the necessary "braking" of your strategy towards the end-game. You build up a great engine to steal away with the lead, and then you have to check it off completely to avoid negative points. I also feel that the game-ending player should be able to finish his turn, selling off any crates he may have completed.

Played once.  The game was enjoyable, but I'm not sure this is a keeper.  Moving your tea collector around to build the tea crates was fun, and the demand mechanism is cute, but I won our game and didn't feel like I had been particularly clever in my play.  I just sort of won.  The game seems to be one of always having shipped goods in the pipeline, so you're constantly scoring, and that didn't seem much of a challenge.

Although I overpaid for this one - copies now going for circa $20 -- it's worth that to us for sure because we enjoy tile games generally and the concept of this one specifically.  Having said that, the some of the components are good.  (The ships are wood.)  
On initial plays, didn't have a good sense of how well the scoring is balanced; however we came to appreciate the challenge that is the core of the game.  It's all about timing. The demand bonus yields relatively few points (without the doubler, which does help the balance) vs. getting shipping points.  The puzzle is considering when to ship (and knock someone else out of the points) vs waiting to ship more.

I think that I would enjoy this game and many others could as well.  I would def. love this for one of those less intense game nights.  Not so much for the nights that "I want crush my opponents, see them driven before me and her the lamendations of their women!"

But I would enjoy this game for sure.

RATING: 5.5
Very simple mechanistically and I do enjoy the 'puzzle' that is assembling the tea crates. It is also a lot shorter than we expected it to be quickly ramping up to the required 100 points after relatively few shipments each. The board is very big and a bit superfluous but I do like the tile aspect and the demand marker mechanic is very novel.

A welcome distraction of a lazy sunday afternoon 

Sold in a board game bundle in 2017.

I am enjoying this the more I play it. It has pretty light decisions, and new players will let the experienced player run away with it, and you have to read ALL the rules, but when you know what you're doing, it's a very nice game. I think the mechanism has potential and I can see this game developing into new versions.

Despite an interesting demand mechanism, this game has little else to offer.  It's a good game, but I don't really get the desire to play too often.  Don't get me wrong, there's enough competition here to keep things interesting; however it just lacks that touch of depth that would make it an 8 for me.

A lot of nice ideas but game is broken, at least with 3 players. The player who will set up in the best place and do first, big shipment is the winner. The other player who will try to stop him will be last. The third player who will not involve will be second.:(

Simple gameplay, but a lot of intertwined mechanics that work quite well together. Granted, it's on the abstract side, and given the weight it somehow reminded me of Portobello Market. I rate Portobello marginally better, but I suspect my score for Darjeeling could go up with more plays, if it proves out to be deep enough.

At the first look - a great family game. Maybe it is great. I didn't find anything immersive in it. You get some points, you move your pawn, you pick up a crate, you deliver some crates and again.

On top of it I don't like games with a victory condition: 'the first player to get 100 points wins'. From my point of view it makes a game random. Maybe I'm not right but I just feel this way.

RATING: 7
Nice set building game, interesting shipping mechasism, plays fast, 45-60 mins means it sits in a nice 'super-filler role'.  Pleasant diversion.   You have to carefully watch what others are shipping to avoid runaway leaders, so there is more play here than first appears.

The selling mechanism is nice in that you really have to choose between saving up for a big sale or selling quickly to devalue another player's score.  That was about the most interesting part of a tea game that for the most part, left me a bit tepid.

Pro:
The wooden components are really nice. The ramp that manages the demand for the different types of tea is a neat thing.

Contra:
The gameplay feels a bit samey, setup takes quite a while for what the game is. Also, 2 players does not seem to be where this game shines.

Conclusion:
It's ok, but there are so many games out there. Won't keep it.

Darjeeling is a game stuffed with nifty whiz-bang machinery - so stuffed, in fact, that there is little room for players to insert themselves into the game.  There's not enough ability to plan ahead, too much physical upkeep, and too much doing the same thing over and over and over with no noticeable progression from the beginning to the end of the game.  I really enjoyed the first half of the game, but by the time the game was over I had already decided that I was unlikely to seek out a second game.

While the shipping part of this game is very thematic, the 'get the tiles/tea-boxes' is abstract. You have to watch what the other players collect to optimize your own moves. It's nicely designed and with wooden cubes and ships, but that's all. It's an ok family game but offers not enough intersting options to the (Euro-)gamer.

This one my girl has found in a store in NY. We were just browsing and all of the sudden, she said, "oh my, look at this!!!"  :)   I love my girl!!!

Oh, about the game... This is fast paced. Almost too fast. I mean, scoring the points, if you get the right combination, just propels you to the moon. Catching up is hard. You really need to have a hand on the trigger and watch what everyone is doing. 

The random setup each game is nice, but it doesn't really throw the game that much. It's the combinations of actions and tea creates that you're shipping that's point decisive. This game needs more play for sure.

RATING: 4
Not a bad game, but nothing about it really grabs me. The mechanisms seem familiar, just put together differently. Good enough, but not great. *UPDATE* After another play, I like it less. There is too high a potential for a runaway leader, and ALL other players (not just one) have to conspire to prevent this. Also, the game feels like an old-school computer game ported to a board game.

RATING: 7
Was quite a bit of fun. The first play was a bit stilted as we had to keep remembering to do the scoring before the turn and all that. Two things that might be possible drawbacks in my mind after the first play: 1. game seems to end pretty quickly once someone gets a couple big shipments under their belt and then keeps scoring for the next couple of turns before their shipment is moved down. I wonder if after more plays we'll get better at preventing someone from sitting too high up the bonus point ladder with a half dozen cases? 2. Is there enoguh time for someone lagging behind in the first round or two to catch up to someone who is well ahead after two turns? Seems like the answer is just barely. One guy who was behind early (me - started in 1st position) caught up to second place. Another guy who lagged at the beginning (started in 2nd position) was dead last at the end. 

I'm wondering if extending the victory condition to 150 points might not be the answer? Or would this just make the game drag? It did feel like it ended abruptly to me, so maybe extending the victory condition will not make the game boring, but instead will make it a bit more tense in the last half as more people are able to jockey for 1st place?

I didn't know what to expect of this game, but something about tea just had to be tried.

Once we got around the setup and figured the mechanics out this game started to become a real winner.  Market system is clever, bonus system, and even how one harvest and ships their tea, it is a rather clever diceless game.

So far only tried with 4 players and with the India setup, but now eager to try the other variants.  I think this is going to be an often played one now with our group.

RATING: 7.2
On your turn you navigate your pawn to pick up a tile straight ahead of your pawn. Rotating your pawn's direction once is free, but there is a cost to rotate 180 degrees or jump over other tiles/pieces of wood.

There is this tension of "should I wait longer to make my delivery to make a larger or more efficient delivery" in contrast to "maybe I should make this tiny delivery now to bump everyone else down in scoring points--because at the beginning of your turn, you look to see if your previous deliveries are still floating around the point-tracker, which is how you rake in points. When you make a delivery, you go to the top (3x points per cube) and push all the other boats down to decreasing point values.

Interesting, a bit chaotic, should play quick.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Unusual.  I like it.  A game about movement with a certain amount of resource management thrown in (if points count as resources).  From the initial setup, I was expecting it to be more like Cuba..in fact, it's very much like itself rather than anything else I've played. (2 play)

RATING: 7
First played May 5th, 2008. Taught it 5min, played in 45min with 2 players. This has good luck/strategy mix. Tiles are layed out in a pattern with a certian number of city tiles. Each player starts on a corner of the tile board and takes one tile on the edge and places his marker. Next the 1st player places a good on the bottom ship, followed by each player placing one on the next higher ship. On each player's turn, you score the ships, move your player marker, and ship complete boxes of goods of the same type. You get VP = the number of cubes times the muliplier(next to ship). When moving you get to move left or right for free, however must pay 1VP to turn 180 degrees. Next you move forward one spot for free and can move any number of spaces forward for 1VP each. Take the tile you end up at and place your marker. If the tile has three sides to it, you get a special token(for rot or 2x shipment scoring). Draw a tile from the bag to replace where you were. When shipping, you empty the lowest ship and place it at the top and place the number of goods you shipped on that boat. If you are not next to a city when you ship one good rots, unless you use a special player token. If you run out of cubes you may, take from another ship. Next move the demand barrel track to determine score. Take the lowest barrell of the color you shipped and place it at the top. You get 1VP for each barrell between the two like colors and may you your special token for 2x on this score. First to 100VP ends the game and final scoring takes place. Since there's not too much to it, it's a good game to consider for those who enjoy less to keep track of. I'd strongly recommend giving this a try and consideration in playing every now and then.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Ideal Players: 2-4

Description: Harvest tea and ship it to distant lands. Score points for quantity, rarity, and being the most recent to ship.

Pro: Different ways of getting points give players options. Straight-only movement makes navigating the board an interesting challenge. Players must spend victory points to achieve goals. Players must watch what others ship, because it affects rarity and most-recent scoring. Beautiful wooden bits for boats and towns. Cool tea collector meeples. Nice art for crate tiles. Game plays very fast, with very little downtime.

Con: Difficult to explain scoring before the game. Requires constant attention to update scoring tract and replenish tiles. Large enough that players can't reach the entire play area.

This game has a lot of clever elements.  And I actually enjoyed the game play.  But the physicaly implementation of its ideas is just plain awkward.  It practically begs for people to forget some step forever throwing the game's outcome in doubt.  Scoring every turn, 3 kinds of scoring, picking up tiles and not disturbing the others, its just too much.  Its unfortunate as the theme is also unique and the game almost pulls it all off.  But the cleverness of the mechanics is ultimately undone by the clunkiness of physically applying them.

After 1 play.

Lighter than I thought (middle-light, I'd say).  Nice family game, which I can easily see as 2008 SdJ contender (if the trend of nominating really light games continues).
  But I've got so many family games, that I don't need to possess this one, despite its overall freshness and some interesting features.  It's just not interesting enough in that context.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I felt a pretty unique game overall, really a good family game, light on strategy and enough randomness that maybe everyone will have a chance. There is some strategy with placement and timing but it isn't a 'strategy game' at any rate, possibly with 3 players planning might be a bit easier than with 5 though. 

The game had very nicely produced bits but the system made using them pretty fiddly. Every turn a tile is removed from the board and a new one is replaced, that was a pain as was scoring someone every single turn as well. Putting the set tiles back after each load was shipped was just silly, maybe after at least 5 or 10 loads the tiles could THEN go back in the bag, this is a small gripe at any rate.

On the plus side the game moves along quite quickly and only lasts about an hour with 5 players.  Some neat little subsystems at work with the bonus ramp and the shifting boats with the tied in bonuses.

Several interesting mechanisms in this pick up and delivery game.  You're concerned about what to pick up and when to deliver it, and about when to cash in bonuses or accept penalties.  Deliveries continue to pay off for a limited time on a diminishing scale based on who delivered the most recently.  There seems to be a lot of knowing when to jump and when to hold back.  I managed to avoid AP problems, so that was good, too.

RATING: 3
I have won every single game of this by a landslide regardless of player count.  The game is all timing and getting appropriate boxes to ship.  I don't desire to play it again.

Setup time is roughly as long as playing time.  The box greatly exaggerates said time to play.  For 2, it might be 15 minutes.

Seems to need more than 2 players.  I like the concepts, but 2 is just not enough.  The more conscientious player will always win, it's just a matter of pushing your opponent off the top bonus ship, and putting out a big load when you know your opponent can't ship anything for a couple turns.  Probably best with 4.

The scoring mechanisms are neat - both the boat located up higher for more points, and the market system.  But the underlying game just doesn't cut it for me.

I played it a couple times with 4. The game isn't notably superior with more players.

First play was not a fun experience.  Seems like later players to select initial starting location can get severely penalized for their bad luck, as the tiles vary widely in their utility.

Have since played a second time.  I won that game, but am reinforced in my rating -- I was the only one who seemed to be having any fun.  The other players seemed frustrated by my large lead (which wasn't really that much due to my skill) and by their inability to get the tiles they wanted.

This game impresses me less every time I play.

RATING: 7
A fun race to 100.  There was a perceived tension in the game as we all tried to score quickly to get to 100 first.  The imbalance in the starting income at the beginning of the game really forces players to "ship tea" early to knock down the big payments the players later in turn order start out with.  An interesting addition to the tile-laying/tile-pickup stack of games.

One big strike against this game is the setup time, which is pretty annoying.  There must be a better solution, perhaps simply by including a separate board on which you can place tiles?  A minor annoyance would be the box size, which is way bigger than it needs to be.  But as for the game, it's fairly clever, forcing you to keep your greed in check.  Scoring at the right time is important, to keep your opponents from scoring too much or too long.  Still, it's a game that doesn't feel particularly new and for some reason lacks a spark that would make the game more appetizing to me.

It was okay for a filler - very fiddly with the bits though! After you cash a set in you put it aside then take the other one aside and put in the bag. After every more you take a tile your on and replace the you moved from - lots of shuffling, and moving - it got real annoying near the end. I think this would work very niely as a PC game though.

Played once, 5p.  I liked this game much more than my opponents.  I think that's because I realize that my crushing defeat was almost completely my fault, and I did eventually stage a reasonable comeback.  The complaints of fiddliness are well founded, particularly with scoring as it might happen twice during a players turn, and a player can lose points during their move, as well as picking up and replacing the tiles that make up the board.  But that didn't bother me too bad.  I'd like to play again, but I doubt I can convince anybody else to.

The theme is tea picking, a bit unusual but kind of works.  It is a tile set collection and pick up & deliver type of game using a modular tile board layout.  The major aspect is that scoring is cumulative and largely about timing.

This is a very unique game about collecting and shipping tea.  Ideally, you want to sell a large amount of crates at a time when no one else is ready to ship goods so you can benefit tremendously in earning points.  Basically, one is seeking to race to 100 points in harvesting and shipping tea!

This game has some really nice and very original mechanics - the boats and the "map" that you push your figurine around in are good designs (although I will have to make a frame for it), and the demand-slope is close to brilliant. 
Still, it's missing something on a higher level, all the good ideas doesn't quite sum up to what they could have.

It doesn't seem that players have all that much control, but we will have to play some more to find out.

Current rating after one game.  I certainly enjoy the look of this game, and the mechanics are unique and entertaining.  That said, I need at least one more play to solidify my opinion, as the first game was very chaotic with five players all learning and playing it for the first time.
I imagine the rating won't move either direction very much.

Really interesting game that requires different kinds of strategy to most games, requiring you think about what everyone else might do in the next few turns. Still plays quickly and easily though (I can get through a two-player game in 20 or so minutes when going fast).

Even though this has all the elements of my favorite games, brand new mechanisms with some tile laying, it still feels a little flat.  There is a tendency for one person to runaway with the lead.  I guess these days it takes a lot more to design a successful Euro. A solid 7 for me.

I really didn't care for the game after my first play.  I am probably missing some hidden depth, but the game just didn't grab me.

08/27/11 Played a four-player game. 
I found Darjeeling...strange. The graphics didn't match the tissue paper theme. There was almost no player interaction. We're all puttering around the warehouse doing our own thing, hoping when we ship no one follows suit very soon. Plus there is a great deal of luck as to which tiles come out of the bag. If a yellow clip board just happens to be plopped down near you due to another player's move, then its a boon to you. If one never gets put near you... tough. And why are cities in the middle of a warehouse? Lastly, here's something I can't say I've ever complained about, victory conditions. I found it crazy that the game ends when someone reaches 100, and then no one can overtake them in some sort of final scoring. Quite the reverse, everyone else is usually bound to *lose* points from unshipped tea, rather than possibly overtake the leader. That's just rubbing salt in the wounds of the losers for no reason at all. I might play it again sometime, but I can think of 50 other games I'd rather play before I do so again.

Dans Darjeeling, les joueurs parcourent l'Inde du Nord à la recherche des meilleurs thés, cherchant à envoyer les plus gros chargements possibles d'une seule variété. Pour chaque variété, les cargaisons envoyées en dernier se vendent toujours un peu mieux, les connaisseurs préférant les feuilles les plus fraîches.
Chacun doit cependant aussi tenir compte du goût du moment, qui peut favoriser tel ou tel parfum.
La partie se termine dès qu'un joueur atteint le score de 100 points.

The wife and I have played.  Would love to try it in a multiplayer setting.  Elegant and unique method of randomization for scoring certain points makes it real interesting.  Taught it to some folks from BGoM.  They were intrigued by the mechanics and quickness of completion.  Played again with a whole different set from BoardGamers of Michiana.  One loved it and another hated it.

The 4 player and 5 player games feel very different.  Adding the 5th player really changes the dynamics.

The only game with Teaples! After a couple of 2 player and 3 player games, I'm surprised at the low ratings this one is getting. This actually is a fun game, with real decisions to me made on (almost ) every turn. It plays between 30 and 45 minutes once everyone gets the hang of it (which happens rather quickly). This is a far better and interesting game than eg Carcassone.

So this is where Habitats borrowed the movement rules from. Nice balance of going big vs going frequent, watching the demand market, etc. The biggest factor in the game is timing, knowing when to sell to deprive others of their profits and sit on the coveted 3x or 2x boat as long as possible. I have yet to master that. Neat, fast game.

The larger German publishers had a very mediocre crop of Essen 2007 games, and this is among the best of those. It's quick, and the scoring mechanisms are brilliant. The huge box and the 30 EUR price tag are an effective deterrent, though, since this is still quite a light game. Not very good with five players.

Originally played this game at BGG.CON 2007.  For my wife and I, it was our favorite game of the Con.  After several subsequent plays, I'm less pleased.  The game is lovely.  I do still enjoy playing.  It just isn't a great game.  I think our initial enthusiasm may have had more to do with the fact that we had someone else teach us the rules (a rare pleasure) at what was our first ever boardgaming convention (another real treat).  We will certainly continue to play Darjeeling.  It just isn't the game we first thought it was.

RATING: 5
I traded for this, knowing little about the game except for the theme and the variable bonus mechanism. Sadly, the theme is almost non-existent, and the bonus mechanism is not enough to offset the repetitive play. Players collect sets of tiles, then cash-in sets of tiles. You score for several rounds in a row if you have not been displaced by the players following. It is imperative to stop a player from getting a big lead, as there is no catch-up possible. So each turn is low-scoring: the players act immediately to drive big scores off the track. Consequently, it is rare to see a big score attempted. Slog, slog. Not enough difference between turns.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Nice, well-working and innovative mechanics. The theme is not the best in the world, but at least it is original. Good-looking (even though not very theme-related) slopy thing for extra points.
It is tedious to rearrange the tiles every time.

Another hidden gem! A great 2 or more player game. The components are excellent and the mechanics are clever, interesting and well integrated.

A great game that kind of reminds me of some Cwali style games like (factory fun or sun, sea and sand).

My early pick for another SdJ nomination for Abacus. A very nice game that moves quickly and it right in the Jury's wheelhouse in terms of appearance, complexity, duration and fun factor.

Now if only the box weren't so damn huge...

***25 Nov 07
Played for the second time (first time was at Essen) and my opinion hasn't changed. SdJ fodder for sure - simple intuitive rules, pretty components and a gameplay experience that can be enjoyed by the whole family. As a gamer's game, it's on the lighter end of the spectrum, but there is enough meat there to make it a worthy addition to the game cabinet. I found that the 3p game was different than the 5p game (Essen) I played in that the ships cycled much more quickly - which meant saving up for big shipments was less useful since you wouldn't get many points for them.

A game of timing - aim to ship just after everyone else does to maximise the number of turns you score big. Collect different colours to everyone else. And may the tile replenishment in your area be exactly the colour and type of box you want to collect. Luck in the tiles, luck in the player scoring interaction. I think I took this one too seriously and didn't enjoy it much accordingly. But there's not enough theme for lightness. I'm mixed.

Interesting mechanics of demand scoring with the rolling tea wheels. Not 100% confident we were playing this correctly, but it was fun & relatively tight for most the players. 

I got to thinking about it later that night.  Seems like a lot of variability with the ability to create different maps. Will the designer/other players be posting different map variations to maximize player competition? 

Subsequent plays may have me add to want list.

Played only once, with two players. The mechanics are interesting, but there was never any excitement in the game.

Probably better with more players.

There's a game in there, and it's quite good, but it's completely ruined by it's long length, repetitiveness, fiddly-ness.  Seriously I think it's the most fiddly game I've ever played.  There's some interesting, unique mechanics in there - but the negatives outweigh the positives.  This is NOT going to be nominated for SdJ.  

However, this would make an excellent video game, like on BSW.  With help from technology, this game could be slimed down to 15 minutes, and the fiddly-ness would disappear.

Like the components - the tile layouts for 3 different areas and the tea meeples look awesome. 
Game play leaves something to be desired. The choices are few and what you choose does not seem to have much impact. Find that the game can have a large runaway leader problem if one player can hit a large shipment when others are trying to rebuild their sets. Forces one of the other players to "take one for the team". 
Liked the bonus mechanic of deliveries but found that it provides less than the 3x multiplier on shipping.

An OK game.  I liked the demand mechanic.  You are kind of at the mercy or when people build.  If no one builds right after you then you can amass points.  If they build right after you then your don't get many points.  Maybe there is a strategy to counter that.

The game has simple choices with huge consequences.  Someone in a strong position can really build a lead, and even if you knock them out of their rhythm, they can recover pretty quickly in a 2 player game.  Might be better with more people, but it was still fun. If you didn't make a delivery quickly after an opponent made a huge delivery, you can fall way back in the points.

Darjeeling -- Played once; four-player.

This moves along at a nice clip.  Timing is everything, in both the short and the long term.  You'll want to collect some crates for quick sales to lower the values of your opponents' tea before they can score it repeatedly, but you'll also want to collect larger sets of crates to garner volume bonuses.  And if you can time things just right, there's a variable bonus based on the positions of colored barrels at the moment you ship your tea.  

The game length was just right for its weight.

Thoughts after 2P and 4P games

The Good: Great and different theme to the usual suspects. Love the bonus scoring mech. Fairly easy to learn and quick playtime.

The Bad: Longish set up time due to laying of tiles etc. Games can run away from you if you're not totally on the ball. Box way to big for what's inside.

Could turn out to be one of my all time favourite buys from The Works.

This game perfectly simulates competitive vacuuming.  Unfortunately, this also has a tedious, luck-heavy, set-collecting market system along with it.  It is an aggravating process to play.  It feels like it takes quite a bit of effort just to keep the game going:  replacing tiles, constant scoring, updating, etc.  

While there are certainly interactive results, there is little intention of interaction. More, just tactically building what you can get, hopefully screwing people along the way. It is all about getting fortunate with the tile draws around you and lucky that people don't inadvertently beat you to the market, or coincidentally slam your boat down in value when they are up to something else.  What results is just a frustrating exhausting experience, rather than a fun engaging system.  That said I will give credit to the clever scoring ramp, I'm sure that it will be stolen and used better in another game.

I liked the game a lot and was surprised to see Günter Burkhardt designed it. All the games that I've played from him were trick taking games but this one is a tile based set collection game.

Some novel mechanics in this game, since it's tile pickup rather than a tile placement game, and your score in this round affects future rounds.   It certainly requires players to pay attention in order to prevent a runaway leader; this is probably what prevents it from elevating higher in my book.

RATING: 6
1st play: a simple set-collection game with a very thinly pasted on theme. The major decisions involve how to move your dude, decide which color to work on, and time when to turn a set in and load a boat. It was OK, sounded interesting after the rules readthrough, but it was really fiddly (annoying and difficult having to pick tiles from the grid, and replace them, every turn) and it just wasn't very much FUN! 

Rules
You put together a play area made of adjacent tiles (we played the India board) with wooden blocks (cities) interspersed. Tiles have 1, 2, or 3 corners of crates shown. There's also a wedge-shape chute that has 2 tokens of each color (matching crates on tiles) randomly placed on the slope. On your turn, in order:
1. Score for your cubes already on boats: VP = #cubes x boat multiplier
2. Move your tea-gatherer. It can make a 90degree turn for free, or turn 180degrees if you pay 2 VP. Then, move in a straight line as far as you want, paying 1VP/tile jumped over and 2VP/city or other player token jumped over. Take the tile you land on and add it to your collection behind your shield. Draw a tile from the bag and place it in the spot you just vacated.
3. You MAY load a boat. If you do, return the cubes on the bottom-most boat to the player, and move that boat to the top. Then play as many tiles of one color as you want, where all the corners are oriented to form complete squares (tea crates). Place as many cubes as you created on to the boat (or 1 less if you're not adjacent to a city). Move the matching color token to the top of the chute. Score VP = # tokens between the 2 tokens of that color. Also score VP if you loaded >3 crates = 1VP/crate. The tiles you just played are placed in the warehouse, with any tiles already there now returning to the tile bag.

Play till a player gets to 100VP; game ends immediately. Everyone loses 1VP/corner behind their shields. Most VP wins.

That's mostly it; just leaving out some rules about special tiles and starting position.

I enjoy trying to make your shipments as efficient as possible, determining when to hold back and wait as opposed to going ahead and shipping.  The main drawback to the game is the fiddly scoring and having to constantly replace tiles.  Plays in just about the right amount of time, maybe 45 minutes.

After playing this 49 times, I am finally raising my rating to a 9.  This is a very nice struggle for points.  The way your shipping project scores again and again (diminishing) until other players complete enough subsequent projects is a really good idea that keeps driving the action.  The idea with the ramp for keeping track of the color bonus is clever as well.  Darjeeling works well for every number of players -- 2 to 5 -- and after many years continues to be one of my go-to games.

I dug this game out just once and played one game with my son to try it out.

I found it to be a simple but interesting game, with some mechanics that are fairly unique (like the little contraption used to simulate market demand for tea varieties). The "board" setup feels rather haphazard, but I guess that's to allow experimentation with different layouts; I'm surprised there aren't more home-made layouts available.

In this single play, we ran into a situation where my son scored first and scored big, and I found myself unable to score anything for a couple turns. That is a really bad situation to find yourself in, and I never recovered from the massive deficit. Because of this, I don't feel like this is a very good game for just two players.

Play again? Yes, I would love to try this game again, particularly with 3 or 4. I think this could be a big hit at home; I just haven't had the chance to get it out yet.Looks like a fun, light game. I'm not sure it balances well with just two players. I need more plays to rate it; with just one play I'm stuck between 6 and 7.

I enjoyed it and there were some new, clever scoring ideas. But the game is a bit fiddly and too crowded with five. It's hard to score on the top row even once with so many players, which is frustrating. It's a fun game and one that I'll happily play, but it doesn't quite capture the coveted 8 rating.

An interesting and enjoyable game of collecting tiles with restricted movement rules or added costs, then choosing when to declare sets based on fluctuating scoring opportunities and the need to push your opponents from recurring high scores. The tile replacement process is a lot less fiddly once you learn to leave a reasonable gap between tiles!

RATING: 8.5
This game is all about timing.  You've got to ship your crates when the price is high, and when no one else is ready to ship.  And when they do, you'd better ship something fast to prevent them from scoring over and over for it.  The tile collection is almost a distraction from the market aspect of the game, but it's fun and adds additional player interaction.  Variable setup tailors the game for 2 through 5 players very nicely, although it's a different game with more players.  Works really well with 5 players.  The tiles can be setup in a different pattern each time as well.  The game looks great too, although the scoring track is a little hard to follow especially considering the misprinted arrows.  It plays in about 30 minutes which is a big plus.  This game is what Arkadia should have been -- light, fast, fun, and unpredictable.

OK, the 1st play with the family didn't go down a storm but I love this little game. I find the mechanics so clever, the way in which the scoring of the points at done at the start of you trun, after that you move the tea collector which the cost is utilised by the points you earnt (or not as you can go negative) which then leads to the whole aim of shifting those cubes to be delivered and getting the top multiplier to give you those valuable points at the start of the turn. Add into that a clever little demand and supply mechanism which is based on coloured discs moving about, it is just simply brilliant.
The only trouble is, the theme is very dry and foresee being a difficult one to get to the table.

Good initial impression. Fast moving and simple while offering depth. Lots to consider. Components are nice - I like the demand ramp. I'm having worries that it seems like the best way to win is just lucking out and not having anyone bump off your large delivery too fast.

After the first play, I can safely say that I've never played a game like this before. From the mechanics to pick up tea tiles, to the rolling discs on the inclined slope thing, this game gave interesting ways to earn VPs. Wished there was a better end-game mechanic that just 'whoever who reaches 100 pts'.

RATING: 7
Very nice! A very good medium weight game. An interesting pricing mechanism--not your ho-hum linear track. Something of a shipping game since you need to keep developing new "routes" as the return on your old "routes" declines. Really needs some sort of grid to keep tea tiles in place.

RATING: 5
Components looked nice and rules had potential, but when playing there was just something off. I can't really put my finger on it. Also randomness of the tiles can give an unfair advantage if someone is very lucky and someone else isn't. Too bad really, because I liked some of the mechanics in this game A LOT. If they actually worked, this game would be awesome.

Darjeeling is an efficiency game that is breezy on strategy and substantial on unique components.  It's a jaw-dropper.  The downside is the very significant board maintenance.

Look, you put out a game that has little wooden boats that you put cubes in, I'll buy it.
That being said Darjeeling is a game of timing, you spend your time gathering your sets and watching the others collections, trying to make that big score, but truth be told, victory will more likely go to the man who times his scoring well, versus the man who scores the largest points.

Its great weakness is the sheer amount of set up you must go through for what is a relatively lighter game, and its confusing scoring track.

Harvesting tea, packing it in crates and shipping it off. The board is pretty randomised, so you get a new playing field each time. The competition element is pretty fierce in this one. Darjeeling is a delight!

This is a very nice game, but you need to play it once to understand how it works. The rules are simple, but it is not obvious what you need to do to win. People have mentioned the runaway problem, but there is not such a think if all players know how to play the game and understand that scoring every round is more important than scoring a big load every 2nd or 3rd round.

Interesting game mechanics for a quick and light game, I still have to try some other different maps.  It will definitely come out again. I want to make real maps with squares for tile placement of the 3 maps that came with the game, showing actual locations of the cities. I also want to make new boards of other tea producing areas of the globe, with keys for what colors represent what tea types in those communities. (Big project!)

Darjeeling incorporates many mechanisms from other games. I like the bonus scoring mechanism with the chutes and barrels. Moving around the fields to collect crates is also a rather nice mechanism to allow players to customize their movement. I particularly like the ability to form different shapes of crates. However, the timing of shipping is key to winning this game. Even one extra round of shipping where no one else shipped is enough to push the score forward. Good but not a great game.

The  point value of what you ship  can vary depending upon the timing. And then an unusual feature is that you can get additional points for that same shipment on later turns. Timing is important, too, in order to disrupt the additional points that other players can collect.  As one player's points for prior shipments accumulate the others may run out of time to stop him.

Traded. First play - 5 players. I was really impressed with this one. The mechanic of boxing up the tea tiles and then shipping the barrels is quite ingenious. The bits are nice as well. I came in dead last but I blame that on lack of rules understanding on my part. The boxes can only be shipped when they are complete. If you grab a bunch of double and triple box half tiles you will be in trouble. I know from experience. I'm looking forward to another play of this one.

Playing this game has been compared to vacuuming your house, and aptly so. Beautiful components but not much excitement and an overly amount of moving and keeping track of stuff with not much payoff in terms of game play.

Speculative tile taking game where we are shippers collecting tea. Abstract. Match colored halves on tiles into complete squares for shipping (my wife loves this part). Unique gravity based tea demand track. Unique mechanics in this game are great; spend victory points for extra moves or tea collector direction, interactive value of shipping your cargo, timing shipping for extra points based on tea demand spread. Fast play, takes some setup time. Surprised it isn't more popular.

It didn't grab us at Essen 2007, but I ended up getting it in a Maths Trade (2009) mainly because of the tea theme. The green board is nice, with its rolling tea barrels and sliding ship scoring. The tile collecting bit is less abstract than I thought it would be. There's a strange, player-influenced rhythm to the game which is interesting.

Most of the scoring is accomplished over time after the action is made which forces preplanning that is uncommon to most games.  There are multiple set ups to adjust the level of conflict to your preference.  This is rather unique and quite enjoyable.

Scott, who taught me this game said that it was very 'fiddley,' and it certainly is.  After the first few minutes you get past that, and it is enjoyable, light, and a reasonable filler.

Interesting and fun game about collecting tea.  The demand bonus marker is a great little mechanism that makes you thank about when to sell crates.  It seems that one player could get a good score and run away with the game if timed right, i.e. no one else can sell in order to push his scoring down the chain.  Even if someone can sell, it may not be an optimum move.

Underrated gem right here. A game about picking and shipping tea which ought to be boring but somehow isn't. The clever mechanics transform this from a simple exercise in picking up tiles to a game of timing and brinksmanship. An example of how a simple rules set can still bring a theme alive by providing an interesting decision space.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
The best thing about Darjeeling is the pacing, everything moved along very quickly.  Unfortunately, the downside of that was the need to constantly refilling the tiles, as well as to make sure the correct points were given at the beginning of each player's turn (since almost everyone score something).  I imagine it will probably be less chaotic and bothersome if you play with 3-4 and not the maximum.

The bonus points from the demand chute was the most noteworthy element of the game, and it certainly allowed strategic play in planning ahead in the collection of an upcoming colored tea that will score big, or to cut someone off by shipping before him with just a single crate.  However, the multipliers for the VP calculation felt poorly conceived and was a constant headache for us.  I didn't really understand the purpose of giving so many points repeatedly, and it seemed that anyone can get a high score no matter what they do, even if they ignored the bonus and just shipped continously.  In the end, the gameplay in Darjeeling didn't complement but rather contradicted each other.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Light, but tactical tile selection with a bit of commodity speculation thrown in.  Every player scores on their turn, then they must move their tea meeple; then collect a tile then have a chance to sell either in small amounts of big shipments of tea. This pays out bonus points. First to 100 causes end of game; however players with left over tiles will cost VP. Players move by spending VP.

Its alright. I thought it was very tactical. But I also didn't like how players scored VP every time its their turn, and how its very old and out of date.  

Its not for me.

Some interesting and unusual mechanisms here.  I suspect this game would be a full point better if automated (e.g. with online play).  It's easy for new players to spend the entire game forgetting at least one step of every turn.  Plus, there's a pretty healthy dose of "a great tile turned up at the right time" lending heavily to victory.  Still, an experienced player playing skillfully should prevail, and I am vaguely interested in exploring the game a little more.  I enjoy watching the mechanisms work, but I'm not sure I enjoy having to turn every cog myself.  :)

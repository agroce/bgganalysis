The platoon game I was looking for. Tense, easy to learn. I really couldn't bear to check continuosly the morale of the units in PG. The only drawback is that in most of the scenarios appear only a few units per part.

RATING: 10
I like the tweaks they have made to the system since WaW:EG [adding airpower, chaos, a victory point system] and the rules seem slightly clearer... addressing the one or two ambigious places in the original rules.  Counters are very nice.  I am also happy that they have more scenarios... up to 12 from 6 in EG.  Sure, I would love there to be 20-30 [or even 100] but I try to be reasonable and with the victory point system and some of the other WaW products out there it is possible to make your own.  My initial rating or 9 was revised up to a 10.  Map is very very nice.

Played my first game the other night.  This is one of the best games that I've played in years. The components are simply top notch. Thick, thick mounted map, beautiful art, simple, playable rules, This is a game that begs to be played, not thrown on a shelf in a dusty collector's closet.

RATING: 7.5
I took advantage of the LnL games sale on this one and I am glad that I did.  As a simulation, I'd say stay clear it does not count as one, but as a fast and fun basic wargame, I highly recommend.
 
  This will likely be the jumping off point for me to play other World at War games.  All in all the rules system is simple and can be learned within 30 minutes and easily taught to others.

  The rules are beautifully conveyed in a color rule book.  But they could use improved organization to help learn the flow of the rules.

  The artwork on the board and the counters is beautiful.  Frankly, I'd prefer the board to look more like a tactical map than a tourist map; but I can still appreciate its beautiful layout.

  The system plays out simply and quickly with the dice rolls.  The best part of the game is the chit activation sequence which i think helps to both add a great fog of war (especially when you throw in chaos events).  The chits activations help show some of the superior aspects of the NATO forces, but keeps them from being overwhelming to the Soviet.

  The scenarios are challenging and because of set up, chaos, and chit activiation, they rarely will play out the same.

  This game and system is a nice balance.  It is simple enough to not be tedious or too much of a grognard game and appeal to lay gamers, but it is tactically sound and sufficient that a grognard can enjoy when looking for a quick fix.

Great game, one that won't stay on the shelf. This is a game that will get played and played. It's simple enough for anybody to pick up the rules in 10 minutes but complicated enough to present a challenge. The game looks great as well. I think the only thing it could do with is a counter tray. They're as common as rocking-horse-*&^% round here.

RATING: 8
A fast-moving game of fictional WWIII combat in the spirit of "Red Storm Rising," "The Third World War," and "Team Yankee." Some of the scenarios are unbalanced and the rules have some holes in them, but overall it is a very good game which mimics the bloody carnage that surely would have resulted if the Cold War had ever "gone hot."

Counters are thin and really hard to read, hate the font. Map has no blue on it, water is all dark gray. But play is pretty fun.  Pretty simple system and scenarios are playable in under two hours.  Not sure about tactics, I'm still learning the system, but there appears to be enough unit differentiation that it will be worthwhile to utilize realistic tactics.

Adding a bit more to the light game engine of World at War, but without overloading the system. It's still WW3 with beer and pretzels, but it's done pretty well.

Better production values for this game with the hard-mounted map a particular improvement. Twelve scenarios also make this better value for money than Eisenbach Gap. However, a few plays and I have concerns about how well they are balanced, principally due to the impact of the battlefield chaos chit.

RATING: 8
World at War brings on the Brits. Deluxe components, more chrome (Chaos, multiple types of ordnance), but the same engine - neat command control rules, dice fest combat, and lots of fun. ATGMs never seem to run out. Like a rock 'n roll version of Assault. A guilty pleasure
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.3
A solid and fast wargame. Not really a solo game (see some other games in my collection for real solo games), it can be played solitaire as training but give the best with 2 players.
Counters have a very nice look, but they are imprecisely cut, that's a shame. I have a lot of wargames and I must say that counters from Lock 'n Load Games are the best for the art and the worst for the precision of the cut.
Another thing: the counters of the other games in the series were opaque, these are bright. I dislike these changes in a series.

UPDATE:
They are sending me a new set of counters. This is good. And after trying the new rules I must say that this game is really good, IMHO better than the LnL series. It's a simple game, with some degree of abstraction: but you FEEL it's good, it's the third world war, nicely put on your table.

RATING: 8.5
Game is quite a bit of fun, and plays very well solo.  I would have given this game a 10 but my copy had a lot of printing errors.  It was pretty disappointing.  Bad copy aside, I would pick this one up because it is a fantastic value.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Just some observations of the components, as I have not played yet. The map board is wonderful! It is a huge high quality mounted map. It is not the quasi-mounted one that you got in Eisenbach Gap, but a real honest to god mounted one. The counters look really nice and I like the style of them. They still seem a tad too thin though. The player aids are nice glossy affairs. I have not had a chance to read through the rules, but they include color illustrations and looks to be an update from the original ones from Eisenbach Gap. Hopefully, they will be better that those were. The rule book is printed on extremely thin stock, so that is a minus in my book. It would not be so bad if Lock 'N Load posted living rules on their site and you could print your own, but that is a whole other argument. 

I am looking forward to giving this a go!

Upon opening game ranks a 7 on CrazyYog's patented Stench O'Meter. With 10 = Duel (Dank) in the Dark Stench.

RATING: 9
Sticking with the BGG rating rubric, thus this one comes up a solid 9. This one won't gather any dust on the shelf.

For three years or so now, I've been playing friends' copies of the the WaW series games, and I've finally gotten around to picking up a bunch of them myself. It's about time, as overall, the system does not disappoint. The overwhelming majority of games I've played have been tight contests. And the scenarios that miss don't miss so badly. A few homespun tweaks to taste can fix them fine in my experience.

I will agree that component quality varies from game to game in the series, and that the typeface used on the counters is a poor choice on the usability front, but for me, these are nits that haven't greatly impacted my desire to play or my enjoyment of the game(s). Do I wish for a bit more consistency and readbility? You bet. But none of that has kept this, or the other WaW games off the table.

My first exposure to the World at War series. Played through the first three scenarios thus far and it is great. Fast, fun, and at times a brain burner. Everything I want from a war game now that I no longer have time for multi day epics. May soon be raising this one up to a 10.

2011/08-Played again. 10 no question. Great pace without rules that you need to reference continually. Very exciting experience to play a game.

A fairly straight-forward chit based system for the war that never was. Probably enjoyable if you are interested in this area of 'what-if' history, but not quite a good enough game (for me) to carry the subject of you are not. Not a huge fan of chit pull systems and the combat result mechanic is a bit all or nothing in terms of damage.

The font choices for the counter values was also a little poor - the chunky outline font used is not ideal for small numbers.

The rules are fiddly and the counter information is difficult for my 48 year old eyes. The FAQ on Consim World is a big help. Some people may be turned off by the randomness and chit activation. For me, these are a plus. The system is fantastic and I am surprised by the variety it offers.
I gave this a medium game weight but if the rules were better organized it would be a light medium.

RATING: 7
Good: WWIII - Tactical - Easy

Rating still based on Eisenbach Gap demo.

Plus:
-Theme, I am a sucker for WW III games (still regret I -sold the Thirld World War...)
-Components; map, rules, counters are all top notch
-Accessible; rules are really easy to get into
-High replay value due to chit pull and scenario's
-System is simple yet comprehensive
-Big map!! Where I found Eisenbach too confined, here there finally is manouvring space!

Negative:
-Some scenario's are obsolete due to balance issues
-Some vehicles (like the Marder) are really useless and you wonder what they are doing on a modern battlefield.
-Values of certain weapon types debatable but if you can look beyond that, it is a really fun system
-I had wished for a campaign game / booklet but maybe this will be published (I think I will get the gamers guide) 

Sot it is fast, furious and fun. Good for those evenings where you prefer something lighter or introduce to a friend. Good stuff, loads of options and good fun.

This is the classic 1980's Cold War gone hot. I really enjoyed the Team Yankee novel and this title captures the conflict perfectly. The system is easy to learn and a lot of fun to play.

An excellent expansion to the World at War series.  Comes with a beautiful mounted map that is twice the area of that provided in Eisenbach Gap.  Gives a good variety of forces for Britain, US, West German, and Soviets.  This is a must buy for those who enjoyed the first game in the series.  Rulebook and charts are in full color.  New features include battlefield chaos rule, bridging equipment, and air support.

New units include, all the British Challenger, Chieftain, Striker, FV432, and Scimitar; Soviet T-80, MTU-55, BMP-2; West German M-48, Marder A1, US M60a3, and air support in the form of Tornadoes, A-10s, and SU-25s.

I love this system, it captures the subject well, but it is very playable. It has a simple but effective command and control system. This game is even more gorgeous than the first volume (E-Back) with a full color rule book, big mounted maps...and planes, including the Wrath of God, aka the A-10 ...6 count em 6 die rolls of 3 or better to hit (Ok so does the Su-25..). 

Also there are several short scenarios, that can be played in about two hours (imagine that... playing a real wargame in 2 hours!)  but are challanging and fun.

I believe this series is the best Platoon Level game of any era... and look foward to their WWII game.

RATING: 7
Another WW3 game from Lock n' Load.  Their system seems to suit the WW3 very well because of the design philosophy of interactivity, small scale and hot topics. 264 counters, a mounted 22" x 34" map, 12 scenarios, $42.49 pre-order price. But how come they arrive at $0.01 off the $42.5? Want to buy on series completist impulse.  More administrative markers, beefed up rulebook, larger map and more scenarios.  Everything is larger here in this new game in the series.  

Yankee and British Chieftain and Challenger tanks, Striker ATGM vehicles, FV-432 APCs, Lynx attack helicopters, Tornado fighter-bombers and others clash headlong into first rate Soviet Guards units outfitted with T-80 and T-64 tanks, BMP-2 APCs, MTU-55 Bridgelayers, SA-13s, Hind E attack helicopters, Su-25 ground attack aircraft...a whole of new stuff for you to play! Where is the infantry?  They are small peanuts in face of the modern powerful weaponary, anything but to hide in the woods or holding onto the city. 

The game introduces for the first time the Chaos markers for drawing from the cup together with other formation markers.  The elements of random events now impact the game in a more wildly manner.  For example, the random event might be Shell Shocked - automatically reduce one from the dieroll on attack or defense for the remainder of the turn!  Additional missions may be drawn in and airstrikes are called in to support the ground maneuvering attacks.  Bad weather comes in in the middle of the day, etc.

RATING: 7
It's nice to have some Challengers and T80s to play with.  Blood & Bridges adds some new weapon systems and random events to the basic WaW system but not at the expense of increasing the complexity or slowing down play.

A few minor criticisms: terrain types are sometimes a bit hard to make out (especially hills) and it can be difficult to tell the difference between 3s and 5s on the counters.  Nobody I know has really been able to work out the fog rules. 

None of these detract too much from a very enjoyable game and, as a bonus, the chit pull initiative system is ideal for solitaire play.

[...]

Downgraded from 8 to 7 after a few more plays.  The scenarios provided tend to be somewhat unbalanced and many only use a small proportion of the available map area.  I shall attempt to create some better scenarios.

As of the time I first played B&B, I was not actually a wargamer at all.  But having had some appreciation for the history and intel that the game represents, I found it not only an interesting game, but genuinely fun.  The map is just bloody impressive.  It's a beautifully made game, and like everything in this series, is easy to learn and quick to immerse yourself in.  The scenarios are well-written, and even a non-war-gaming chick like me can appreciate the stories they tell (and can follow the rules they lay out).

Probably one of my favorite fast-playing systems. Chit-pull is great for F2F or solitaire, the components are top-notch, the rules are simple yet detailed, and the theme is brilliant.

RATING: 7
Update Jan 2015:  I continue to enjoy the game, but am finding it quite difficult to win as the Russians (in my admittedly mostly solitaire games).  

ATGMs are somewhat overpowered in this game system, knocking out MBTs with alarming ease with near limitless ammunition.  And the more effective the ATGM, the less likely it will run out of ammo (?!).  Maybe a modified ammo restriction rule (from SPI October War) might bring in some balance.

Infantry also seems a bit OP in this game as well... due to their speed (faster than some vehicles?!) and (way too lethal imo!) deadliness in close combat, especially in urban terrain.

Would like to see "balancing" options for the scenarios to even things up... extra units, extra turns, extra assets (smoke and arty missions).  Players could bid for sides with these in mind.

Alas, I've sold off all my other WaW games, but kept this one.  

Can still be a fun game if you don't take the game too seriously and recognize (or maybe don't recognize) the concessions made in the design for playability reasons.  However, I'm looking forward to the publication of the new MBT games by GMT which I hope will become my preferred modern tactical game system.
------------------------------

Very well done...  compared to EG:  larger map (and mounted), twice the number of scenarios, more counters/formations, and neat new rules like chaos and air strikes.  I do prefer the slightly thicker, semi-gloss counters of EG (2'nd printing), but that's really my only nit.

Game graphics are first rate:  color rules book, laminated color player aid cards, excellent looking counters and map.  In my mind, this is one of the best platoon level tac armor games ever published.  Fast, deadly, and fun to play.  

A must have if you liked EG.  Really looking forward to future WaW games and modules.

Good, lots more stuff, but the font choice is still poor (underlinings are too thin and 3s look very much like 5s).

Don't believe me? Look at the example Challenger in the rules - on the reduced side, are the 2s undelined or not? Answer, yes they are, but it is not easy to distinguish, and normal people would probably have to pick up the counter to check.

Other than that, I like it.

Edit: I have just seen a post complaining about the 3s and 5s, so it's not just me. The good thing is that LNL are looking to improve it, thumbs up for that.

Component wise this is by far the best of the WaW series games.  Large mounted map, color rules, laminated play aids and great looking counters make this pretty much a must have for WaW fans.

---

Gameplay offers the same smooth series play as prior games, but there are some minor rules tweaks in this version (mianly additions for close air support, slightly different chit rules for non-activating formations, and a neat additional bringing chaos / random events into the scenarios).

---

The Naughty Bits.  So like everything there are the some blemishes : 

I wish the rule book was made of tuffer stuff - the paper is thin bordering on flimsy (minor in my books - but there it is).

The British tanks seem a bit too strong on attack and defense - they are by far the deadliest of the WaW system so far.

After several plays I feel like, in the larger scenarios, the odds can be stacked against the Soviets as a few larger Sov formations will be opposed by large numbers of smaller British formations which leads to chit odds of 4-1 or higher against the Soviets so maintaining advances becomes difficult and disrupted units rarely see the chance to rally.

---

3/3/09 rating from 9 to 8.  Need to try some of the smaller scenarios with less Brit chits in the cup.
3/12/12 rating reduced from 8 to 7.

World at War: Blood and Bridges introduces the British forces to the World at War series.  As a commanding officer in the BAOR (British Army on the Rhine) you will find yourself controlling Chieftain and Challenger 1 tanks, as well as infantry and support weapons.  You opposite number has T-80s, APCs and swarms of infantry at their disposal as they try and capture the important bridges over the river Rhine.  Stopping the Soviets here will really hamper their drive into Western Europe.

The World at War series has very little rules overhead.  The rules are easy to follow and quick to get into.  Combat is a matter of rolling the required number of dice trying to roll higher or equal to the ‘to hit’ number.  Defender then does the same thing for their armour roll.  Successful armour rolls cancel out successful hits.  (It takes longer to explain, than to actually do.)  A word of warning, tanks can be very vulnerable to long-range anti-tank missiles.  My Soviet forces have melted away as Milans and TOWs have reduced them to smouldering wrecks on a number of occasions.  Makes use of terrain and smoke to move across the battlefield if you want to bring their guns into play.  Of course this could just be me and my inept play!

The scenarios follow a similar pattern to World at War: Eisenbach Gap though there a more scenarios than were in that game.  Each scenario shows a small section of the Soviet advance and usually builds on the scenario before.  You will usually find small NATO forces defending against larger Soviet forces though occasionally the NATO player will get a chance to go on the offensive.

The rules have been tightened since Eisenbach Gap with some new concepts added like air support and battlefield chaos.  The extra rules though do njot really add to the overall complexity.  If playing solo one of the great helps is the chit-pull mechanism which adds a level of uncertainty to who will activate next which helps to keep things interesting.

Overall Blood and Bridges is a fun part of a quick playing series.  The small amount, and easy to grasp nature, of the rules means that you spend more time battling your opponent than flicking through the rule book.  Most of the scenarios can easily be played in one sitting, while still providing an interesting challenge for both sides.  Blood and Bridges is a welcome part of my collection.

Great addition to the Eisenbach Gap, World at War line of games.  

This is a real wargame but might actually find a crossover audience due to its ease of play.

Well streamlined/edited rules.  Great map graphics.  Great counter graphics. 

Scenarios are numerous, some are better than others but they tell a fascinating story of what-if 80s-era NATO/WP conflict in Germany.  Break out the Luftballoons.

RATING: 7
Lightweight but effective platoon-level game which plays very quickly. 

Components have attractive vehicle icons, which adds to the appeal, though the font choice is very sucky. The terrain on the B&B map is superior to Eisenbach Gap because there is far more cover, but still sometimes the battles can become extremely bloody. 

The chit-pull initiative system has some interesting dynamics, but I feel gives NATO far too great an advantage in play. The entire game is designed around these highly asymmetric scenarios in which company-sized NATO units are pitched against battalion-strength Soviets, which may make for interesting play, but a less convincing model. Some of the scenarios may lack testing-there's a feeling of imbalance about how some of them play. 

Also something needs to be done about throttling back the usage rate of ATGMs, which deal out Xtreme death and turn APCs/MICVs into major killers. Fortunately, I have a solution for this cribbed from Mech War '77 that seems to work quite nicely...

Nice tactical system and neat topic.  I wonder if air and helos are too powerful.  For one thing, there doesn't appear to be a rule for "friendly fire" attacks by air units.

Higher production value than Eisenbach Gap. Glossy counters, full color rulebook. Like the others in the series, B&B moves quickly and is very playable. I've struggled playing the Soviets so far--two unit activations for the NATO elements is tough to overcome.

Not sure why Eisenbach Gap never really did it for me.  However, Blood and Bridges just seems to be... better.

The hard-mounted map was a nice touch.  The counters are still a bit hard to read and some of the backs were way off on my copy.  At least this time there are enough Ops Complete markers to go around.

The few scenarios I've played have been very fun.  Granted the game is a little dice-happy but it's a good kind of dice-happy.  The game just feels "right" for the time period.  Looking forward to getting this puppy on the table more often.

RATING: 6.5
Interesting activation system spices up an otherwise okay game. Nice components, but it's true about the font selection on the counters: It's tough to read at that size... . Ultimately, I don't know what it is about this particular title, but when I'm playing a wargame, I don't like to picture myself as a middle-aged man playing with toy army men in his garage while his family sleeps at night. But that's what this game does. There are certain aspects that remove me from the narrative. I certainly don't take myself seriously. I play boardgames, duh. But, this one, for a wargame, it's just feels too silly and irreverent. This adds Nerf guns to the "beer & pretzels" category.

I like this system. Tactical warfare but not too complicated. I have played it with my children. This is not to imply that it is simplistic. It uses chit draw to introduce battlefield uncertainty. In my games, the Soviets do not fair well. They lose tons of units but that is probably accurate.

Just finished my first WaW game playing Scenario 2 with a buddy who's a fan of the series. Nice game. Rules are easy enough that you can get rolling quickly, but there's definitely some subtlety to understanding how to use your units well. The scenario seemed well-designed - a meeting engagement with basically symmetric VC's yet requiring very different strategies from each side in order to capitalize on their strengths. Production values were generally very high - excellent looking board, nice play aids and counters. My only production gripe is that the fonts on the counters were very difficult to read (especially 3's and 5's). Otherwise, very good-looking and functional. I'll play this one some more.

RATING: 6
Although this tactical wargame is simpler and faster than most, it's still not simple or fast enough for my tastes.  Tactical wargames and I have a strained relationship, as mechanics like different kinds of weapon, opportunity fire, and command radius largely leave me cold.  This game manages to streamline out some of the most frustrating hallmarks of the genre, such as the ingenious distillation of hits/defense, but it's still more than I want.  A simulation that takes longer than the events which are being represented is not appealing to me.

RATING: 9
Solid design, fairly simple rules for a wargame, nice board, lousy graphics on the chits (the numbers are way too small).  Overall a good game but loses a point for the counter font.  This is your basic hex & chit wargame where units are activated by a random pull.  Given the range and nature of modern warfare, there are no ZOC's to worry about in this game.  Also, being a small battle almost tactical in nature, you don't need to worry about supply lines.  However, you do need to worry about command range.  All this together makes for a fast moving game with plenty of firefights going on.  B&B cleans up some of the rules from the previous release Eisenbach Gap and covers the Brits against the more powerful Soviet T-80s.  The board size on this is twice the size of its predecessor and there's 12 scenarios from a small encounter to the full court press which allow for game play times from about 40 minutes to a few hours.

Rating of 8.5 based on playing all scenarios.  Would like to rate it a 9, however using the geek rating guideline this isn't suitable in my opinion, so settled on a number 1/2 point above WaW:EG.  This game is superior to EG, but I still like both.  Balance in some of the scenarios is a concern to me.

Great big mounted one-piece map, not a hell of a lot of counters, but certainly feels better value for money than Eisenbach Gap. Regardless, a good, solid system with easily learned rules. Wish the counters were easier to read though...

I was very pleased to receive this last addition to the WaW family.

The game quality is improving with every episode as this one is in full color: charts, map, nice counters. 

The map is big and gives you the opportunity to play in-depth battlefield and manoeuvre battalions more easily. 

It is a "must have" for every WaW aficionado!

Congrats' to the LnL team and Jim Snyder (the module designer)!

If you liked Panzer Blitz/Panzer Leader, then you like this cold war type game that has a few twists added. Chit draw system, simplicity of play, all good stuff. I would rate this game a 10 if they only would come out with a Series rules, and then all they would need for the expansions would be the special rules. As it is, skip all the rule books and read Untold Stories to be up to date.

Blood & Bridges is a stand alone game (you don't need any of the other games in the series to be able to play)

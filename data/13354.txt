Must have this if you want to play Car Wars at all. Covers all the rules of the various expansions.

RATING: 8
Can't really rate this on its own, as you need counters and maps to play.  If you bought the Deluxe Edition, you'd get the rulebook and all the counters and everything anyway.  Seems rather strange that this should get its own entry.

Rated based on the usefulness of the compendium as it centralised a lot of the info that previously was spread across several places.

THE Car Wars rulebook to own.  Great art and all the rules covering cars, cycles, trikes, vans, trucks, 18-wheel tractor-trailer rigs, boats, helicopters and hovercraft.  This is the Car Wars bible.

The game is good, the movement rules are well thought of, I'm just not a fan of measuring movement nor heavy calculation.

I LOVE Car Wars.
First game I ever ran at conventions. Scaled up 3X to use Hot Wheels cars.
I was also an original member of the CADA. Oh Yeah.

Great game that definitely feels dated.  It's very rules intensive and it can take you multiple hours to fine-tune your car build - requiring tons of math in the process.

We loved playing this as a campaign as well as engaging in autoduels and the free-form nature of the ruleset is exciting.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's a car building game, it's a car fighting game, it's a roleplaying game (sort of). What's not to like if you're a motor head?

This game has spent much hours on my table when I was young. The thrill of Mad Max, the techno aspect, the pleasure to prepare his vehicle, the mercyless combats... really good memories. 
However, I'm not sure I would appreciate this kind of system today, sot my rating reflects my opinion 15 years ago ! The concept is quite straightless and basic, without clever tricks to lighten & speed the sessions.
Typical to 80's games.

RATING: 8.5
Not for casual players: mechanic is very slow.
Suitable for role-playing mode.
--------------------------
No para jugadores ocasionales: la mecánica del juego es muy lenta.
Es posible jugar un modo "rol".

RATING: 7.5
Cars, guns, little cardboard bits. YES!!

The rules are not horrible bad and can be streamlined fairly easily (take out hovercrafts though. I have found (traditionally) this works best by setting up teams and playing against one another as opposed the RPG-like play.

RATING: 10
One of the first, and probably best, miniatures game I ever played.  I wish Steve Jackson would reprint this game, because I feel with the numbers of popular tabletop miniature games these days, it would be a successful competitor.  The best thing about this game is customizing your miniatures and building arenas, unfortunately, because of the GURPS rule system, the battles can be somewhat long.  So that can be good or bad, depending on what you are used too.

Fair.  All the rules together, but not organized terribly well.

All the rules finally collected together, but still some holes.  See my Car Wars comments for ways to answer most of the holes.

It's good to create the vehicles, but gameplay is tedious.

RATING: 6.5
Much like Battletech, if I had the time, space, and money, I'd go bonkers with this game.  As it, the black boxed set I have is plenty.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The most thematic game ever made. Step by step you create a thrilling car duel and the result is awesome. Incredibly cinematic without any "tricks", just good mechanics.


Spanish Edition by Joc Internacional. Same content as the American version but with scenarios from Midville and Truck Stop. 

I don't have any counters, planning to buy Micromachines

RATING: 10
One of the greatest gaming books ever produced.  After playing over thirty games of this in the 21st century, the only thing I'd change would be to use 5th edition fire rules and a GURPS style combined speed/range modifier.  A true classic.

By turns slapdash and tedious; still had many excellent evenings with friends cooking up scenarios with our almost always illegal in some way cars, trikes and copters. Good times because of my friends? Nostalgia has clouded my objectivity.

Probably the best single-volume version of the game.  If you love Car Wars, this should be in your collection.

Same Rating as other versions of Car Wars, although the all rules in one book thing is nice.

I've never seen the need for helicopters, big rigs, hovercraft and boats, though. I was always content with the basics.

It's nice to have all the rules in one place. 
I do not care much for the rules about the other (non cars, trikes, cycles) vehicles.
The game was long, but I remember it with fondness.

RATING: 6.5
I absolutely love this game but it just hasn't aged well. SJ's attempts to revamp the system (without vehicle building) left me flat. Attempts to get my game group into the older ruleset have met with mixed success despite that almost everyone is a math/engineering type.

I really want to give this a 7 but can't quite convince myself.

Overly complex rules. Designing vehicles was more fun than measuring 1-inch increments for movement. A game shouldn't take an hour of real time for five minutes (or less!) of game time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I love the theme, but:
It's complex.  It takes forever to design vehicles.  It takes even longer to play out 8 seconds of gameplay.  The components are horrible.  But I can't help but love blowing cars up with a recoilless rifle.

Hasta que lo vi en BGG, lo clasificaba cómo un juego de rol. Aunque sobrado de tablas, una vez que aprendes a jugar transmite muy bien  la atmósfera de pelis post-apocalípticas en plan Mad Max.
Las fichas son pequeñas y endebles.

RATING: 6
This game was a great excuse to buy some cheap little Matchbox-style toy cars, build a cardboard "arena", and push them around pretending to blow each other up.

The effort involved was pretty high (you had to design all the cars yourself, not to mention building the arena and getting the toy cars) and the game wouldn't at all be worthwhile with flat paper chits on a paper board. The "turning key" was always pretty fiddly.

And yet... my inner child still finds the idea of pushing around Matchbox cars with machine guns oddly appealing, and that's really what this game provided, even if it otherwise doesn't have a lot of obvious features to recommend it.

If you're going to play Car Wars, this is the book to have. It contains all you need to get started, rule-wise -- you'll need to find counters somewhere else, though.

I have never heard anybody describe Car Wars without using the term "fiddly". And yes, fiddly, it is. 

If you like the combined thrills of 80s futurism, ultra-violent vehicle combat, and stamp collecting, this game is for you.

Just don't sneeze.

RATING: 7
This game brings back memories...hours and hours spent designing/building cars.  The game seemed incredibly cool back then, though I don't remember playing it :\  I am currently in love with Star Fleet Battles, so I can only assume I'd enjoy Car Wars again...though I suspect CW might seem a bit basic in comparison...

This type of game is also, definitely, not for everyone, as it's slow...methodical...calculating.

An 80's game of post apocalyptic race car battles that plays like a mix of X-wing, Battletech and Starfleet Battles. Dated, but fun enough for what it is and as a bonus, it plays twice as fast as any of the previously mentioned games!

Spent a huge portion of my childhood playing this.  Affectionately known as "Loophole Wars".  A few years after the compendium came out the "official" rules were put in charge of some guy who would make sweeping changes every few months.  We just stopped playing.

RATING: 5
Car Wars is a great classic, but all the expansions that were released over the years made for a lot of rules discrepancies.  These poorly written compendiums didn't help.  There needs to be a new compendium with some better rules clarifications.

Tipo Sim City, sistema draft para cojer losetas, tipo 7wonders, multiples opciones para hacer, aunque demasiadas con el poco dinero que tienes, me esperaba otra cosa del juego, mejoraría quizas haciendo alguna regla casera, como que si vendes una loseta recibas la mitad del dinero que vale, y no siempre 5$. Así no esta nada mal el juego, pero no verá mesa para probar otros y lo vendo

I really do like the drafting mechanics and the tile placement. Towards the end, the board looked very busy and it was a bit hard to keep track of what's going on and which cubes are available and which are already spent. 

Only thing that I missed, was more player interaction when building the city. Now everyone just branched to their own direction and built their own power and water plants.

Half [b]7 Wonders[/b], half path-building & delivery.  A neat combination, but unfortunately suffers from the "not quite as much fun as the similar game and takes three times as long to play" problem.  So, really, this is a fine game.  Fun to play.  The "board" ends up looking REALLY busy, so that slows down the game some.  But yeah, it just takes so much longer to play than [b]7 Wonders[/b]...it's hard to say if I'll get this to the table again.

It is a tile building game emulating the growth of the city. In four rounds you pick and place tiles representing different types of building. Then you power these up with electricity and water in order to gain their bonuses which can range from money to victory points. It starts well but it does not provide a great finale, where you have that feeling that you have built a great city. It is mostly about micromanagement and finding the right combinations between resources and bonuses.

The idea behind the game is not bad, but the game overstays is welcome on the table. After the 3rd stage of the game most people were already quite bored and did not feel like going on, the only reason to continue was to see if the last round brings something new. 

I have mixed feeling about this game, it's not something I would play again also because the lack of functional graphics and too many small things to pay attention too, but I have the feeling that there are people out there who will enjoy City Tycoon.

There is a lot to digest in this game, so you have to give it a couple plays before really understanding it.

This is really an engine building game where tile placement does play somewhat of a role (although it is fairly easy to box yourself away from your opponents). 

Definitely requires a lot of planning from players both in terms of tile drafting and how they manage their various resources. Fun and strategic, just make sure to watch for AP prone players as there is a dizzying amount of information to analyze in this.

Very solid game. Based on the abundant availability for ridiculous cheap prices everywhere, I approached this game with very low expectations.
What I found was quite an enjoyable 2-player experience. The rules are easy and quick to learn and to teach and the game by itself does not overstay its welcome.

Neat mixture between drafting, tile laying and resource management, mixed together with a tiny bit of opponent screwage.

The most negative I can say about this game would be the size of the box compared to the content. Might be the reason for me to eventually axe this game in order to free some precious shelf space.

A játékmechanizmus alapvetően tetszik, bár a draftolás és az eldobott lapkáért 5 pénz egy az egyben 7 wondersből van beemelve (az ennyire direkt másolás nekem sose szimpi)... Az erőművek tetszenek, főleg a kétoldalúság miatt (bár általában egyértelmű, hogy melyik fele éri meg jobban). A szállítás módja, és a lapkák jelentése egyszerű, és azt gondolnánk, hogy egy egzakt játékkal van dolgunk. DE! A színkavalkád miatt nekem nagyon nehezen volt áttekinthető! Majd kiesett a szemem, ha csak azt megkerestem, melyikek is az én épületeim (pedig mindenki szinte egy kupacba építkezett). Önmagában 1-1 lapka szép, de sok egymás mellett szerintem ízléstelenül kusza és a sok élénk szín üti egymást, a kis jelzőink és a erőforrások kockái ezt csak fokozzák. Kizártnak tartom, hogy ezt lehet hiba nélkül játszani ("jaj elfelejtettük hogy ott jár egy pont a szomszéd lapka miatt", "várjá má, ott is van egy épületem" stb.) Maga a szabály nem káoszos, de grafikai okokból mégis zavarosnak érzem az egészet.
Talán emiatt nem érzem kiforrottnak, de egyébként jópofa.
Ami még fontos: a játék a sorrenddel elég jól kompenzálja, ha kevés a kör eleji pénze valakinek. Ja, és jó a kinyomó:)

While I still find it hard to clearly define what kind of games I enjoy, I think I'm starting to learn the type of games I hate. One of them are these games that involve building a production engine that will transform one resource into some other resource and then pump out points. While there are times where themelessness doesn't bother me, for some reason it does in games like City Tycoon. As for reasons I dislike this particular themeless engine-builder, there are several. There are WAY too many opportunities for analysis-paralysis. People can contemplate their tile selection in the draft, they can puzzle over which tile to play (and where and how to play it,) then they can debate what order to activate their tiles (and where to draw the resources from in order to do that activation.) Then there is the board confusion. When you are in the midst of the activation phase there can be so many cubes on the board, it will be extremely difficult to tell at a glance what cubes are available. So, while I'm sure some people will greatly enjoy this game, it is one that I will greatly enjoy never playing again.

I have issues seeing the board on this one.  once the game hits middle to end, the whole board just looks like a big blob to me.  The theme doesn't really come through to me either, and while the idea of pull electricity and water is interesting, the chaotic nature of having people pull from you just doesn't end up being as fun as i would like.  Don't mind playing this one, but its probably not something I would request.

The logistics of building buildings near the energy/water sources is kinda neat, and setting up chains of resources and requirements is cool. The board does get hard to visualize near the end, but thats a minor gripe. Next time I think I would buy more resource generating buildings.

A játék szépen kivitelezett. A grafika hangulatos és a jelek is egyértelműek az elemeket. Első játékra kifejezetten jó véleménnyel vagyok a játékról annak fényében is, hogy utcahosszal vesztettem. Van a játékban némi konfrontáció az energia felhasználása terén, de emellett mindenki inkább a városrészének felépítésére koncentrált. Kicsit kevésnek éreztem a fordulók számát, de mégis elég, mert már a negyedik körben is volt bőven min gondolkodni és itt tényleg exponenciálisan nőtt a gondolkodási idő. Én például túl sok energia forrás gyűjtöttem be és az utolsó körben már fel sem tudtam használni, pedig sokba került. Ebben a  játékban is visszaköszön az, hogy megéri-e a költség ellenére a közösből vásárolni, hogy a másik ne tudja megépíteni a giga pontjait, vagy a saját ingyen előforrásokkal több pontot szerezhetünk ellenfeleinknél, bármennyire is próbálkoznak. A játékot elsőre elég kiegyensúlyozottnak éreztem és szabályok sem bonyolultak, annak ellenére milyen hosszú a szabálykönyv. Színesíti a játékot a körök elején "card drafting" mechanika.

Decided to keep this over Suburbia.  Suburbia have the problem that the players have to spend time to constantly look at other players' tableau because some tiles a player want to play have their effects influenced by the specific tiles and the number of them the other players have on their side.

A good solid attempt at a Sim City style game, focusing essentially on supplying buildings with water and electricity in order to then gain the VPs or money that they provide. A cluttered and busy board, but surprisingly easy to see the connections once you know the icons. And it looks nice as you build the city up. Clear combo opportunities for the more experienced player. Would like to play again.

With 2 players, it just doesn't feel like there's enough tension or interaction.  Someone has suggested placing building next to other players waterworks/electrical plants and stealing but I'm not sure if that makes sense or not.  I want to try this with more than 2 to see if it feels more tense but at this point it may be hitting my trade pile.

I've played it with 5 players now.  It plays much better and I'd say there's a good game (though it still feels like multi-player solitaire with a little bit of screwage).  My problem with the game is the components.  The scoring marker is a piece of cardboard on the board that is easily knocked and can't be re-calculated.  The player order changes every round (there are 4 rounds and each has about 10 turns) and is tracked with a piece of cardboard on the board and it requires one player to keep reminding everyone whose turn it is.  The plast issue is it's hard to see the players' markers on the tiles.  None of these issues is insurmountable (VP chips, player order pieces that players keep in front of them and player cubes instead of cardboard to place on tiles) and hopefully if the game gets a 2nd edition, they'll include these (or owners can pimp their copies with these).   For myself, without the component issues, the game would be a 7 but with them it's a 4.

What I liked in a game whas the city building with tiles mechanism. Production quality is ok but I disliked the scoring board and the tiny chits used the mark the score. We did also spend a lot of time discarding tiles to get money which seemed odd. 

Impression after one play is that City Tycoon would have demanded a bit more development to elevate the game to the level of good games.

RATING: 8
This is a great game.  In many ways, I would say it could serve as a gateway, or at least that next step after the gateway, save for the possibly confusing iconography (small concern) and the ability to massively screw your opponent out of resources (more major concern).  It is very simple rules-wise, and a breeze to teach, though.  And it seemingly has a lot of ways to work the system - at least, there are tiles that I still haven't figured out how to use effectively, but am really enjoying trying to build a strategy around.  The tile drafting mechanic works well, and building up the city is cool.  The resource distribution phase is very reminiscent of delivery in Age of Steam, and is the major source of possible screwage.  So, while a game that theoretically any gamer can play, I'm sure those of us with more experience (or those who don't mind sharpening knives) will enjoy it much more.  A very impressive game, due mostly to the elegance of the ruleset.

Surprisingly good city-building game. I really like the "build or discard for money" mechanic, and the game can get quite competitive, even cutthroat, as players compete for space/resources.

Some tiles are clearly better than others, and a lucky draw at the right moment can be crushing, especially in a two-player game. We have several city-building games we like more, but this is still a solid design.

Ever since Glen More I’ve been trying to locate more 'topological growth games’, in other words snowball games which feature spatial restrictions in what you can activate or not. City Tycoon appeared to be a jointly constructed area of tiles with separate activation of tiles; plus a mechanism to transport resources over what has just been built. It certainly sounded interesting, so I found myself staring at a small set of tiles at one point during Spiel 2011.

The artwork was certainly evocative, but regrettably it all went downhill from there on. First problem is the Notre Dame/7 Wonders-style passing along of building tiles. Dear designers, please: this royally fskcks up any good strategic plans you might have had otherwise, and turns the game into a tactical point grabbing mess. Notre Dame at least has some card memorisation, but you can forget that with 7 Wonders [i]and[/i] in this title. Especially this title, because you'll only draw a subset of all city tiles of an era. To make matters worse, so many tiles need to be passed along that it is simply no longer possible to ‘guesstimate’ or ‘anticipate’ what someone will do with the tiles you’re trying to set him or her up with.

All this, and we haven't even gotten to the main game yet. Well, I wondered what the point would be, actually. Yes, you can grow your city in various fashions, and attempt several growth patterns based on what is in the tile stacks of different eras. The supply phase, which sees you activating other tiles at a price (transport costs to be paid to the players you're passing resources over), is a nice touch. But if I am to be constructing a city neighbourhood, I want to have more say in what I’m planning and where. Too bad: the game had potential, but the mixing mechanism ruined it for me. I wonder if I’m not being too generous with the current rate.

City Tycoon has an 'Among the Stars' feel, but without the building diversity.  Really, most of the tiles in City Tycoon are very similar with minor point variations and I'm not entirely convinced on the need for drafting (In practice I find this to be a slow mechanic).  On top of that, scoring is from the pick-up & deliver phase and money is tight - so tight!  What I found most frustrating about this game is that the game really restricts what you can buy and do and there's a lot of discarding to accumulate more cash.  Other games you have options on your turns, but in City Tycoon it's a lot of waiting, passing on great tiles beccause of cost.  7 Wonders has this to some degree, but in that there are zero cost cards, money paying cards and using chaining.  None of this exists in City Tycoon and sometimes I would have to burn 3-5 tiles, just to save up to buy the 1 or 2 tiles I did want to play this round and ensure I had enough left over to buy electricity and water in the scoring phase.

There are so many components (Agricola-level), so lots of pre-game sorting and sifting.  The iconography and tiles themselves are good, table footprint manageable, but the futuristic art is jarring and the theme didn't come through all that well (you do not play as a 'tycoon').  The rulebook has some vagaries and several questions came up.  As well, I felt we needed some marker or better method to indicate whether a tile has been utilised or not (we used leftover player tokens).  With 4 players, it got a bit slow, especially in the latter rounds where people are trying to maximise delivery scoring (as scores are tight) on the abusrdly large scoreboard.  I did like that buildings power-up in the later stages, but this means most of the scoring (though not tile placement) in earlier rounds is then irrelevant.  There's not much benefit for collecting certain building-types (as it's PU&D) and Stage IV buildings become so expensive that most players will only be able to build maybe less than half their hand (by discarding for cash - never fun).  

So overall, it sort of fell a bit flat and became too busy and AP inducing at the end.  It's an OK game, but there are lots of city builders and I'd really like to try Suburbia in comparison (and will then revisit this review).

With the amount of components, sorting and calculations, I think the game may work better as  a digital app.  Although there are some 'residential' buildings, it is unfortunate most of the tiles are so generic in character and I felt more that I was building a giant factory, so as a tile placement game, I'd probably go with 'Among the Stars' instead.

It's got a lot going for it, easy to understand icons, synergy between various buildings and phased complexity. The money is tight and managing your portion of the city is a challenge throughout.

I like the power-up mechanism and the scarcity of resources, but in the end it is a victory race; at some point you've got to be focusing on maximizing your VP...oddly enough you don't abandon your less valuable properties - if you planned properly.

The graphics are surreal and very Googie (look it up), but hurt the game, the layout is very consistent and colorblind friendly.

Really enjoyed playing this, although our first game was over 3 hours. The graphics are very attractive, but as always, the icons are a little too tiny. But the gameplay is very good. Nothing new in the game, it's all familiar stuff. Drafting tiles at the start of the round. Spend money to build/sell/swap tiles, gain VPs, cubes, use cubes for more VPs. Supply tiles with cubes, transport cubes, pay other players to cross their tiles, get bonuses, get extra points for contiguous tiles. Player order goes from poorest to richest. Most VPs wins. Absolutely nothing new in the game at all, just the usual stuff in the usual order.

So why does the game work so well? The money and pricing is amazingly close. We were constantly starved of money, and having to sell tiles we wanted to keep in order to build. Only 4 rounds, but it started slow and decisions were crucial. One player screwed up badly, and went into the 3rd round with no money and no cubes to use, and could do nothing! All his own fault, he was in a good lead, and we capitalised on his error.

Definitely a very good game. If you find a copy at a reasonable price, and you like this sort of game, grab it with both hands.

A lot of people seemed to enjoy Suburbia, so I'm not sure why this one isn't rated more highly. It's got a lot more direct interaction, and the choices you make hang with you throughout the game. The pre-round drafting of Blood Rage and the passive aggressive tile placement of Carcassonne, and tricky capitalist things like paying for your opponents' power so they need to buy YOURS (ideally going through a ton of your tiles)... it's intelligent and thoughtful all the way through.

It seems "Energy Tycoon" would have been a more fitting name for the game because while you do pretend to construct a city the game concentrates on energy production and consumption to the exclusion of all the other factors that actually might make this a city (as opposed to any random industrial area).

Now, focusing on one specific aspect of city building isn't necessarily a bad thing, but the issue here is that the problem space is mostly uninteresting. You need energy to power your constructions, and you need to pay for energy transport - unless you use your own tiles. So everybody tries to build their own thing in their own little part of town, and if you're feeling kind of nasty you'll try to drain other players' energy stores. That's actually a very odd combination: There is either no interaction at all, or it's an all-out attack that can easily cripple a player's turn entirely.

The spatial considerations when placing tiles are mostly irrelevant as long as you keep close to the power plants which isn't all that difficult to do. Trying to disrupt other players' placements by breaking up their 'hoods is usually going to punish you at least as much as them and therefore doesn't make too much sense.

And for a solitary maths exercise the game simply takes far too long, and the increasingly crowded and unclear board does its best to make it even longer.

The graphic design of this game is too confusing, making it difficult to assess the miniscule differences among the various tiles at a quick glance. I love card drafting, and I love communal board-building games, but City Tycoon was a horrible experience.

During the card drafting phase, you're choosing from a hand of stuff like: a building that costs $2 and produces $4 for one water, one that costs $3 and produces a good and $5 for one water and one power, one that costs $3 and produces $5 for one power or 1vp for one good, and one that costs $5 and produces $7 for two power or $2 and one good for two water. Does that sound fun? Pretty soon, I just tuned out and thought, "Who cares?"

I really like this game.  All in all it feels like Age of Steam with a variable map which is built while the game is in progress.  

Comparing this game to 7 Wonders or Carcassonne however doesn't make too much sense.  Sure, there is some tile drafting and tile laying but the main focus is to build an cube-delivery engine which generates both cash and victory points.  The challenge here is to find a good balance between cash and VP.  

The second thing I like is the confrontational aspect.  It is essential to constantly analyze the locations of all cube-generating tiles (aka power plants).  You will always try to get as many (cheap) cubes from the other players as possible while simultaneously keeping them from getting your own cubes too easily. 

However, I doubt that this game is really playable with 5 players.  Even with 4 players you'll most probably need a fast group.  AP players will definitely bring this game to a halt.  But then again, AP always sucks :)

Nice city building game with a nasty touch. Some may play this game like they got their own little city, but some will play it aggressively. You can block ways and steal ressources which may cause a headache to the opponents.

Good and easy game that catches the theme pretty well.

タイルをドラフトして、タイルを置くか、タイルを捨てて金を得るかを繰り返す。その後、湧いた資源を運んでリソース変換。シンプルな建物建設ゲームとしてまとまっている。ただ色々と考えようと思えば考え続けられてしまうため、人数は少ない方がスムーズかと思う。ドラフトしたタイルも一部捨てて金にするためピックの緩さが好みではない。また、インタラクションについてもリソースの奪い合いにはならず、あれ取られたならこっちにしようとなるだけなのも残念。

Tedious, non-exciting and loooong (for supposedly family game) exercise (2players-90min; 5players-180min!!).  I was bored and felt like doing homework during the play...

Serious ergonomy problems - starting area as well as power stations and waterworks SHOULD be distinguished somehow.  At present the situation on the board is hard too read.

Extremely abstract game.

Until a few days before Essen, this wasn't on my screen at all. Then suddenly, people started talking about it on the Geek and as I like Sim City and the art of this game, it went on my list for Essen.
I liked what I saw. Each of the four rounds starts with a draft of tiles. Players have to balance the development of their city between generating money, resources or VP's while managing the spatial component of tile-laying and not losing sight of what the neighbours are doing. It's not a deep game but players need to be concentrated all the timeor otherwise they easily will make mistakes which usually will cost them VP's. My single concern is that there's almost no way to catch up with a runaway leader once somebody got together a nice coherent infrastructure.

Quite fiddly rules. A game is not that hard, however players must get used to different symbols. Moreover, there are many things, that could be overlooked during the play: which cubes are on an electric plant and which ones are used, what "bonus" the neighbouring tiles provide, or that after building a district a forest or a lake must be built. Nevertheless, a game is interesting, but I must play it several more times to understand how the game should be played. By the way, money is really scarce in this game. In the beginning players get only 20 coins and some district cost 9 even in the first round. And everyone is allowed to build 6 of them. Moreover it is not easy to pump money up to 20 after the first round.

Gana painiai parašytos taisyklės. Nors žaidimas nėra toks sudėtingas, prie simboliukų reikia priprasti, o ir pražiopsoti jame galima daug ką: kurie kubeliai ant elektrinės, o kurie panaudoti, kokie "bonusai" suteikiami iš gretimų langelių, arba tai, kad statant kortelę, reikia pastatyti mišką arba vandenį... Kaip ten bebūtų, žaidimas pakankamai įtraukiantis, tik dar turėčiau kelis kartus pažaisti, kad suprasčiau, kaip viskas vyksta. Beje šitame žaidime kažkaip labai jaučiasi pinigų trūkumas... Gauni tik 20 pinigų, o jau pirmame rate yra apskričių, kainuojančių 9 ir daugiau. Jų pastatyti galima 6! Be to antram ratui vėl iki 20 užsipompuoti nėra taip paprasta.

It's easy for many publishers to fall in love with a game's art to the point of losing sight of basic functionality issues.  I'm afraid this game has that issue.  Play is reasonably smooth APART from the graphic design issues--player tokens look too much alike, map colors are garish, the art dominates over the important game elements on the tiles.

Great idea and easy to get in and play, but unfortunately could (and should) be clearer and easier to see the overall situation. That's why it takes some time to make all the necessary moves to the end AND that's why the game takes longer than it should. City Tycoon experience suffers also a bit of because of those building tiles which ones comes more and more powerful... But yes, this is a game which one I'm ready to play again.

In City Tycoon players assume the role of businessmen investing their own capital in expansion of the city. Their main purpose is to increase the standard of living, and thus the happiness of its citizens. They have within reach a whole range of projects that the city council wants to achieve, but which lack the funds. By skillfully selecting plans, using available space and deciding which projects their money should be spent on they will be expanding the city and competing for the title of the most people-friendly company.

It's a nice game but it's a bit too analytically long (with 100% public information) type of game for me to enjoy so I probably won't re-visit it again.  It's pick-up-and-deliver and I feel I'd rather play a meatier train game like Age of Steam instead.  If was shorter and less public info then it would fit better as a light-medium class game (rather than feeling like it's a lightweight game that has analysis time bringing it to a medium length game).

This one is going to need another play before I can really express my thoughts on it. After only one, I'm a little bit disappointed. It falls down, thematically, and it gives an illusion of interaction that I don't think is really there. We played with five, and if that doesn't cause conflict, I don't see how fewer players would. It seems like everyone just builds their own little thing and makes it go, only occasionally using someone else's resources. Maybe one can play more aggressively, pirating others resources, and we just weren't doing that enough.

Also, the drafting portion of the game seems a bit superfluous. While some tile synergy is possible, I don't know that there is much you can do during the draft to either set yourself up for this or deny it to someone else. I don't know that everyone just rolling with the six tiles they're dealt would make that much of a difference, other than shortening the game.

I liked this well enough, but unless another play shows me some more depth, I don't think it's a keeper. (Second play was a little more satisfying, as there was some more competition involved, but I ended up selling it.)

Seems like the game may depend upon siphoning off of other players' power and water plants.  We didn't do that, so it seemed like a rather bland euro.  The player interaction might add something, but still doesn't really stand out to me.  Might as well just play Alhambra.

A mixture of mechanisms from other games. Feels like Age of steam, mixed with seven wonders (drafting), a little bit of Singapore, Power grid with some Helvetia saus on top. 

Not bad but takes a bit too long (with 5 players).

Difficult to play this game right from the first time. Icons are not always as clear as they should be. And the board gets very crowded at the end of the game, making it difficult to see what is going on and what you should/could do.

Being the owner of power / water plant I can't refuse sales when the other player wants to buy my resources and deprive me of necessery media for my supplies. Thus my opponent hurts me twice, because he gives me 2 dollars which increases my cash resource. And cash amount in turn decides about the sequence of players. The less cash the better position on the sequence track.

Weird as for eurogame.

I like city building by tile laying, love Infinite City, but despite it sounds like a good concept, mixing drafting, tile laying, resource management and pick-up-and-deliver isn't that great. The drafting is either slows to a halt while everybody tries to form their general strategy, ruined right on the next pass of tiles, or degrades to quick passing to the point where it could be played by just the randomly drawn initial tiles, dropping the drafting entirely. The tile laying part does not work well with three and four players, there's hardly any chance or interest in interfering with the others' plans, and everyone plays on his/her side of the board. Although I like the overall graphic design, the tiny player tokens and using the resource cubes to mark the already activated tiles makes the board a mess, and it's really hard to see what's going on by the second turn.
It's not a bad game, it has its moments, and the kids like it for some reason- it's OK as a casual pastime.

Really wanted to like this game.  Love the artwork, but ultimately I wonder if it's right for this game.  It's visually difficult to see everything that is going on. As the board gets bigger it gets pretty cluttered. Everything was upside down to me and that didn't help (I wish designers would think about this -- that's one thing Carcassonne does very well). Otherwise, it's a pretty good game.  As others have stated it has a similar feel to 7 Wonders with a drafting element, but unlike 7 Wonders I think this slows the game down a bit too much as people try to consider which tiles to keep. I'd give it another play sometime if somebody invited me and maybe I'd like it more and see some deeper strategies, but otherwise I probably won't seek it out.

A tile laying game.  Every round you 'draft' 6 tiles that will form your hand for this round, than you play the tiles how you will, and lastly move things around to score you points/cash.  Do this four times and that's game.

This one fell flat for me.  For every good play you choose to do, you close the door on three others.  Yes, the game is 'tight', but not fun.  When it comes time to start pushing cubes around it remains uninspired to me.  There is competition for different goods on the table, so there is a bit of screwage going on, and with only four rounds if you find yourself on the losing end...your kind of...well, screwed.  With only four rounds you would think this game is a quicker play, but unfortunately it plays a bit too long as well.

I would play this again, however, with all of the good plays you have to throw away, the screwage, and the way that the game stays a bit too long for it's welcome, I am not seeking it out anytime soon.

RATING: 5.4
The gameplay is simple, the rules not that much, and I also found the symbols to be confusing and I had a lot of problems to differenciate the tiles once they were on the board. You draft tiles and either place them on a common map looking for small combos or sell them for money, as in many other games. In the second phase, you move cubes around and transform them in order to activate the tiles you previously placed, similiar to many other games.

Even if this is nothing new under the sun, City Tycoon works as game. You can't help but notice that the game is quite balanced.

On the downside, it is quite mathy, especially at the end, and it creates long downtimes, especially with AP prone players. Never play it with 5 players. Games do not last 60 minutes, it's around the 2 hours mark.

The combos allowed by the tiles are pretty simple, you won't need a deep strategy to make it work, an there are not a lot of ways to play it; I guess this will undermine its replayability. 

Watchout for the snowball effect.

Not bad, but a bit dry and dull. There are much better gaming options around.

7 Wonders the Tile Game. The economy is interesting and tight but the game moves at an extremely slow pace, even with three players.

The final deck does not seem that balanced, especially the tiles that give points for power/water plants seem ridiculously powerful, at least with fewer players.

The tiles were very worn when we got to test the game on Friday at Essen, so the drafting scheme might not be the only thing they've copied directly from 7 Wonders.

The rulebook causes some unnecessary confusion and misunderstandings because not all of the icons are explained in the icon list.

City Tycoon is a tile drafting game. Players draft city improvement tiles, then play them in turn onto a shared city layout. Buildings produce resources which are transported to other buildings, where they are converted into money and points. Money is used to pay construction and transport costs.

City Tycoon was a trap for AP. What tiles to keep? Which ot build? Where? Should I convert resources here or there? Clearly there are interesting drafting strategies and tactical choices about where to build. Two or three player might be manageable, but five players was too slow. Players also have to make out small symbols on dozens of tiles. I would play again, but can't see this game returning regularly to my table.

This is a solid tile-laying game that incorporates a lot of different mechanics. Each round starts out with a closed (7 Wonders-style) draft in which you get the tiles that you can play during the round.  Tiles can either be played for their cost, or discarded for money.  Then players take turns delivering water or electricity cubes to their tiles to produce money, points, or goods cubes that can be themselves traded in later.  The cubes come from either a neutral plant, a plant you built, or even an opponent's plant--you have to buy the cube from them (they cannot refuse) and no matter where you got the cube you have to pay transport costs to move a cube across an opponent's tile.  This is where most of the interaction in the game comes from, but players will tend to place most of their tiles together to avoid the transport costs, and taking someone else's cube turns out to be just a screwage move at the end of the game.  Overall, I really liked the tile placement and the fact that positioning mattered, I enjoyed the economics of the game, but I didn't like the low interaction unless you're trying to screw someone aspect of the game.

Bought this on a whim. I love city building games and tile placement. This is Drafting tiles and tile placement- Everything I love! In the 2p game it was a bit weird. we were each playing a solo game it seemed- building up walls and not trying to really mess with the other players space. It wasn't really beneficial do to so. Not as much interaction as I was expecting but maybe with more players it will be better. I still really enjoyed what it was doing and thus rated the game higher then many others. Definitely want to play it again to see if it can be more evil.

7. Initial rating after 1 play.  Described as similar to suburbia, its a more interactive singular city building game.  Players draw city tiles in the same manner as 7 wonders.  Next is the city expansion phase in which your tiles are either added to the city or sold off.
Finally is the powering of the city, where players take actions using shared resources in order to power their industrial & commercial zones whilst earning VP's or money or build points along the way.

why this stays in my collection
More plays required.

Normally I'm not that keen on either tile-laying, complex iconography or pick-up-and-deliver, but this worked for me; I was impressed. Money management is the key; get it wrong and the system is unforgiving. It's a cut-throat game but I shall return to the fray having learnt my lesson. Recommended.

A game of city builders. Everyone plays the role as an urban planner, building your own infrastructures and ensuring the power and water supply. In a multi-player session it could be very sophisticated as anyone can use your supply and vice verza. However I don't see much protection to those lacking behind. Once you start off your production train you are likely to win as time goes by.

A city building game with three different resources (electricity, water and goods) which are used to power up abilities which grant bonuses which help build the city further. Tiles are drafted as in 7 Wonders. Fairly nice implementation but nothing new here. Also I'm not sure of the balance and the possibility for several different strategies.Some of the strategies are all too easy to block if certain tiles do not come into your hand at the start of the turn.

Looks like the prototype had nicer bits than the finished product. The small player chits in the game just don't stand out as well as wooden houses. Pity. Such a busy splash of colours makes it too hard for my brain to follow. Pity. The game looks like fun.

--------

Update: The new German edition art is so very much nicer than the multilingual edition. Colours really stand out on two edges with images of structures that make sense and don't look like blobs or toasters. Funny how a dam can look like a dam when you draw it thus.

--------

Not a bad development of the city builder. The 7 Wonders style passing of tiles around works even better here because you know your chosen tiles before you start building. The rules are very easy to understand and can be taught well in under ten minutes. There's a good deal of player interaction if players start crowding their opponents, and after about half way through your first game you have a good feel for what you're up to.

Nice game.

7 Wonders mechanic of take a tile(card) and pass the rest.  You lay tiles by paying for them or sell them to the bank for $5.  You can't build everything.  Money gets tight.  Then you take actions by activating the tiles.  Energy is short and oh by the way did you save money to buy that energy?  Very fun game.

Took the plunge after Amazon slashed 50% of the price.

WOW... 

This really should be a game I hate... 2 and a half hours to play a 4P learning game... Serious over analysis (especially in the tile drafting phase)... Tough to keep up with bonuses/resources for the tiles (especially as the board expands in later rounds)... Really hurts the brain...

BUT... 

I quite enjoyed the game as it didn't seem to drag... Also really liked the theme and idea of the game... So much so that I am willing to play again soon, although will have to try and think of ways to get the game time down a bit (Random tile draws at the beginning of each round??).

An initial 7 rating... May go up or down depending on getting the game time down, and finding ways of highlighting certain tiles as the game progresses to make scoring/resource distribution easier.

UPDATE: Dropping rating to 6, as really can't get friends family into this one (may be too much icon dependency). Plus still can't find a reasonable variation to quicken to card drafting up.

Egy újabb esseni a Kingdom Builder után. De sajnos míg a KB nagyon kellemes meglepetés volt a City Tycoon már sokkal kellemetlenebb. Előzetesen csak a kinézetéről olvastam rosszakat. Érdekes volt a 7 Wondershez hasonló draftoló mechanizmus és a Power Gridre emlékeztető erőművek. A játék 4 körből áll. Különböző épületlapkákat draftolnak el a játékosok a kör első fázisában, majd lehelyezik ezeket és később működtetik. Ezekből pénzt szereznek vagy győzelmi pontokat, majd így megy le a következő többi kör is. Kétfajta erőmű van a játékban. Van egy központi és mindenki vehet még magának. Ezek különböző mennyiségű energiát termelnek körönként vagy egy alkalommal de akkor többet, amit sajátunkként ingyen, másokéiért pénzt fizetve tudunk felhasználni különböző épületeink üzemeltetésére. A játék baja az átláthatatlanság és a nagyszámú jó lehetőség végigszámolásának esélytelensége. Már a draftoláskor ki kellene találnunk a legjobb megoldásokat, de a hihetetlen sok lehetőség közül szinte lehetetlen. A kártyák sokszínűsége sajnos nem segíti elő az átláthatóságát a játéknak. Nem rossz elgondolás a CT, de szerintem nagyon nehéz a legjobb utakat megtalálni, ha pedig ezeket valaki megpróbálja nagyon elhúzódhat a játék. Alapvetően mindenki megpróbál egyféle építkezni és a saját erőműveit használni, de ha ez megborul szinte teljesen átláthatatlan lesz mi az optimális választás egy-egy esetben. Nekem nem jött be ezen okokból a játék, de objektíven sem érzem túl erősnek.

Holy optimization, Batman!

This is the kind of game where your decision is to either go with your gut or take your time to math out the optimal play (what's my net gain if I buy these two tiles and sell these four vs selling this one, changing this to a power plant, selling two more, building this one vs etc...then figure out which order to ship cubes).  If you are good at parallel processing then this game might be worthwhile for you.  Otherwise, you stare at all your options and add up everything, figure out the logistics and then assess the optimal move.  Some people's moves will ultimately be better than others, so if everyone was a robot, then one player would be "better" at the game than others despite having equal computation skills.

Now after you've done all your math. Mix it in the blender as other players can disrupt your play by taking cubes you planned on or buying a plant that you could only afford at a low level.  Now recompute.  

Because there are only four turns, getting blown out of one can be tough to recover from.  Also, the game isn't short.  "You must suffer and cry for slightly longer."

I do think it is a solid design, it just is too much work with little payoff.

If I were ever to play this again, I'd use a generic cube to indicate that a tile had been used rather than keeping the goods on the cube (removing the resources shipped there), this will allow people to see what resources are still available without visual clutter.

After one play here are my observations:

Its an awesome city planning game.
Great graphics, solid construction though the $ should have been bills vs. coins.
Its way heavier than I thought I it would be.
Be prepared for a 2.5 hour endeavor with 4.
Feels a little wallace-y in that you are very limited in what you want to do vs. what you can do.
The power plants need to stand out more from the rest of the board.
Not sure why you would want to share with other players for resources.
Looking forward to playing this again.

Interesting tile laying game. Played only once, with two players. I like the combination of drafting and tile laying, puzzling to find good combinations in the tiles. Interaction on the board seems limited though, as everyone tends to create their own spot. But more plays are likely to prove me wrong.

A clever tile-laying game with a nice card drafting start to each round. The game has a little too much downtime with 5 players, but does some good things.

I dislike the icon that scores points for adjoining tiles as it gets easily lost in the middle of the game, but overall, it's not bad.

This game falls into that category of dry "produce cubes to make more cubes to make money and victory points" games, where it's about building an engine and trying to figure out the best combinations. A lot of people don't really care for that type of game, regardless of how it is implemented. For some strange reason I do like those types of games, so I enjoyed this. It's not the best game out there, and it's a little dry (with a theme just kind of tacked on afterwards) but I like it despite its warts.

If it didn't take so long to play, it'd be okay.  The city is just too busy to assess rapidly.  Also, while many games are better with a variable turn order (as opposed to simply going clockwise) this always adds a bit of time to a game and THIS game can't afford to be slowed down even more.

Very impressed so far.  I love how it comes together.  With the tile placement bonuses, delivery mechanisms, cash/victory points and the types and costs of specific buildings with drafting.  Simple base rules but many strategies develop due to how all the simple icons interact and how tiles are positioned and who you need to buy from.  Nicely done.  Minor gripe would be possible run away leader, but would expect that after more plays this would be rectified by the experienced.

Update: Nice game with little replay value.

I have to play City Tycoon again before I rate it because the guy who taught us this game made some fundamental mistakes in the rules and that completely unbalanced the whole game. The snowball effect was tremendous as we discarded tiles for 3$ instead of 5$ (7 Wonders Style!). If you didn't build a proper money engine during the first round you were effectively out of the game as it was impossible to catch up with the cash.

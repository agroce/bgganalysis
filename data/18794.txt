Sounds interesting, and after playing Avery's dart gun prototype, I think the mechanic is actually really sound.

RATING: 7
Unique game. Shooting is fun. Different characters and how police works is also higly original and great!

But:
In the course of the game, not really balanced any more, victory requirements are also not very well designed. Can drag towards the end.

Needs to be reworked and streamlined, than it could be a really funtastic game!

Unique, fun and wonderfull game. Theme is a little dark. My complete rating...or more like ranting ;-) is in the Reviews section. I've also translated our SuperGang rules to english in the Files section.

Advice to new shooters: if you have difficulty hitting your target with the dart-gun, look at how you missed your first shot and compensate for the deviation when you aim!

Played it back in college. Pretty unique considering that a dart gun is part of the game. I was a surprisingly good shot with it.

Yess !!!
Jammerschade das Ludodeliere 1996 von der Bildfläche verschwunden ist. Eigentlich war jedes Spiel der Franzosen ein Garant für unterhaltsame Spiele.

Haven't played in years - I remember it as slow and plodding, but the best bit was combat shooting the rubber darts

Must fun with Scotch on the rocks or playing with kids...

Plays anything between two and five hours. That the gun isn't too accurate is essential to the game. Unfortunately, the arrows don't last a lifetime, so we are on our third gun or so. 
Still, this game is a true classic. We have some special rules to give the cops a fighting chance in a game of five, making that the ideal number to play SuperGang.

Had this game for many years, and only recently gave it a try in a four-player game. It totally rocked. It can still hold his ground against newer games, despite its age.

Not for small room !!

Could be a 10 if there were not many, many unsolved rules issues, but even with houseruling (and by using the victory condition variant) this is a great and very thematic game (with a heavy dose of luck, so be warned).

Un jeu très immersif,avec un système de résolution des conflit pour le moins unique. Malheureusement Supergang est aussi très long, surtout pour le premier joueur éliminé!

Luck driven. Fun though but not playing it often.

Shooting at targets to decide the outcome of gang fights is funny, and I loved this game in its time

But by todays standards it plays way too long

I don't think there are many games where you can play a drug dealer, a vamp and a killer. The map is a work of art. Too bad the plastic dart gun ncluded in the game was so fragile, it is kinda unplayable without it. And this gimmick is both the best part and the downfall of the game.

French vaersion.

A funny game. I'll rate 8 but the timing a bit too long when you a have terrible shooter or the unbalancing way when you have a sharpshooter lower the rate to 7.5.
However, it's a game with fun.

This is a great board game & shooting at the store owners & gang members with the dart guns during the robberies & take overs is a blast. A real fun part of the game.

 Fabulous game: hours and hours to play with other students associating tactics and dexterity 20 years ago. Still a success today with my children! 
The "campaign rules" available in the version I own to quote game after game performances is also a + to stay addicted !

Ah, there was a time when this was my favourite game. And how can you not love it, with those great components? When you look at the game today, it turns out to be not spectacular at all, but it still comes together nicely, what with the theme, the metal gangeeples and the shooting of course.
I am looking for a replacement gun!

Awesome gun, fun game, but ultimately too long and too much work for what it is.

Very original game play with a gun to "kill" the gangsters (represented by cards that you must hit from 3m), a lot of humor.Very good souvenirs of plays with this game

Superfun & politically incorrect. Great illustrations & material by Gérard Matthieu. AH's gangsters has not the same flavour.If you consider that those 3 Ludodélire guys were also the authors of Full Metal Planète, you realize that they were a kind of dream team, able to develop great games in totally different categories

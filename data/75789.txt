It's an okay light game. You build a tableau and hopefully get rid of your cards in time. But rounds can drag on for a bit, so it's actually longer than you'd think. Still, it's a decent light portable game.

A small boxed cardgame with a unique theme and nice artwork. It has a lot of take that moments. 

Ενδιαφέρον καρτοπαίχνιδο στο οποίο ο κάθε παίκτης είναι μια γκέισα και προσπαθεί να έχει πελάτες υψηλόβαθμους άντρες τις εποχής ώστε να είναι αυτή η πιο ξακουστή και πλούσια γκέισα της χώρας. Τι να πω; Είναι και αυτό μια φιλοδοξία, ένα όνειρο. :p

Διαλέγουμε λοιπόν από μια γκέισα και ξεκινάμε. Η κάθε μια έχει διαφορετική ικανότητα και διαφορετικά στατιστικά στους 3 τομείς του παιχνιδιού. Γενικές γνώσεις και παιδεία, καλλιτεχνική φύση, εξωτερική εμφάνιση. Γιατί ως γνωστό μια καλή γκέισα εκτός από όμορφη πρέπει να έχει γνώσεις για να σταθεί σε μια συζήτηση αν θέλει να την κυκλοφορήσει ο πελάτης, αλλά και να μπορεί να τραγουδάει, να παίζει όργανα και να υποδύεται ρόλους. :p

ΟΚ ας σοβαρευτώ. Οι κάρτες τις τράπουλας είναι οι υποψήφιοι πελάτες και αν καλύπτουμε τις αναγκες τους μπορούμε να τους κατεβασουμε κάτω και θα μας δώσουν ένα ability αλλά και θα αξίζουν πόντους στο τέλος του παιχνιδιού αν είναι ακόμα εκεί. Και λέω αν είναι εκεί γιατί πολλά abilities σκοτώνουν ή κλέβουν πελάτες. Μια άλλη επιλογή είναι να παίξουμε μια κάρτα σαν βοηθό ώστε να ανεβάσουμε λίγο τα στατιστικά της γκέισας ώστε να μπορούμε αργότερα να ικανοποιήσουμε καλύτερους πελάτες. Σε αυτή την περίπτωση όμως θα πρέπει να τραβήξουμε μια καινούργια κάρτα από την τράπουλα. 

Όταν κάποιος κατεβάσει όλο το χέρι του τότε ο γύρος τελειώνει και μετράμε πόντους από τους πελάτες. Το παιχνίδι κρατά 3 γύρους με μια παραπάνω αρχική κάρτα κάθε φορά και ο τελευταίος επιλέγει ποια γκέισα θέλει από αυτες που ξεκίνησαν το παιχνίδι. Μου άρεσε πως αν θεωρείς ότι η τάδε γκέισα είναι καλύτερη από την δικιά σου μπορείς να την αλλάξεις.   
 
Μου αρέσει όταν ένα παιχνίδι ξεφεύγει θεματικά από την πεπατημένη. Έχει μεγάλο interaction με την μορφή take that αλλά τουλάχιστον κρατάει λίγη ώρα (ούτε 30 λεπτά) οπότε είναι ανεκτό. Το artwork είναι ωραίο και ατμοσφαιρικό, σε καμία περίπτωση χυδαίο.

This is a fun filler that is quick to learn and play. Its theme is quirky and makes for a few laughs around the table. It plays best with 3 and 4, but works fine with 2, even if the publisher doesn't have that number listed. Plays slowly and starting characters are slightly unbalanced with 5-6.

Despite the low number of recorded plays, this is a game that gets played quite frequently, often playing 3-4 games in one afternoon with some people visiting. This is an extremely fun discard card game. With each round giving you a different Geisha with their own strengths and weaknesses, you are always forced to employ a different strategy to empty your hand before everyone else and have the highest amount of points.

"You need more 'advertisers' to 'serve' that 'client'."

The game is small, compact, and easy to learn and play. I would say it is a light filler, but a longer one.
There are some interesting combos you can set up and trigger. But the biggest issue with the game arises from the 4th colored card, which is a rare and special card called the Shogun.
There is too much imbalance in this game to call it good. The decisions are not fun, and when most rounds come down to a race of playing a Shogun or ending it before a Shogun can played, there's too much luck there in drawing a Shogun.

I missed a couple crucial rules when being taught, but that only served to make the game more painful that it already would have been.  A game has to be really exceptional for me to enjoy it if it contains directed player on player attacks, as this game does.  This game is not exceptional.

RATING: 6
A nice and simple card game where you try and get as many clients as possible, while advertising and improving your skills at satisfying clients. No, not prostitution but rather the players are Geisha who try to gain new clients with their artistic, conversational or musical skills.
There is a good dose of "take that", as most of the clients will also grant a special action to the player who has played it successfully. 
Not a bad game, but a little light.

[b][FirstPlayOn12thMay2014][/b] Another game that grows on me slowly. I didn't like my first play at all, but only after my third play, I see myself enjoying the little subtleties of the game. There's a lot of take-that in the game, which normally is a turn-off for me, but since it's a quick game, I think it isn't so bad. All my 3 plays have been with 3-players, and I think I prefer with that player count. With more, I can see it slides towards the chaotic side. Comes in a great box size (AEG version) and the artwork is great.

RATING: 6.6
A fun hand and tableau management game. A lot of "stomp the leader" moments transpire.

Upsides:
+Card game so you don't need a large, flat playing surface; a boon for those of us without a clear surface to play on.
+Rules are clear; never had to look for clarifications that weren't there.
+Gorgeous art. ＡＥＳＴＨＥＴＩＣ
+Rules contain plenty of flavor, which is much appreciated among some of the more hardcore players I meet.
+Not a gruesomely long journey or feather-light filler; a good game for when there is just the right amount of commitment and vigor to make most long games too daunting and most short games too lackluster.
+Luck is a factor.

Downsides:
-Too complex for my impatient friends and too simple for my board-gaming buddies. Occupies a nebulous space of mixed feelings.
-Natural rubber-banding due to players overwhelmingly focusing anyone slightly in the lead often creates hard feelings, sometimes making someone's victory feel cheap. Depending on the mix of cards, this can be overwhelmingly brutal.
-Sometimes there's not enough player-checking just due to the cards available, resulting in players feeling powerless to interrupt a combo everyone saw coming or runaway game everyone is frothing at the mouth to stop.
-Luck is a factor.

Fun game. The take-that mechanics can make the game feel unfair if not a little malicious at times, and luck is a big factor that can really make someone win or reduce someone's options to simply losing less, but most of the time it isn't so extreme that there is no recourse. People can and do take this game a little too seriously sometimes. Make sure the atmosphere is light-hearted before proceeding with introduction.

I'm generally not into take-that style card games, but if I were, this would be one I'd pick up. There are some nice decisions here in that you can play a card as a client which gives you certain attributes or play it for VPs if you have enough attributes. The cards also offer actions, so of course you're constantly knocking each other's clients out with card actions. Seems to reward good play in spite of the luck of the draw. Don't understand why it requires 3P.

Nothing particularly new in this little card game. You can either build up your resources/prerequisites or play scoring cards (which double up as action cards).

The implementation is mediocre at best, with rarely a meaningful choice, dramatic swings of luck and a totally random feeling.

Good to kill the time if you really have nothing else to do and you don't feel like devolving any mental energy to a game.

It is a kind of free-for-all competition game. Every players have to compete to each other and then be the final winner. Mai-Star reminds me Burn Rate which is another famous free-for-all competition game. Mai-Star has a bit more details and complexing strategies. However, the game aspect is also easily determined by card lucks. I didn't feel any freshness while comparing Mai-Star to other games. The game theme is not really appealing to me. If I closely compare MaiStar with BurnRate, Burn Rate has more simple rules, easier text and mechanics. For me, Burn Rate is going to be my choice. Love Letter is still the Kanai's best and representative game.

Somewhat interesting given you have only two different choices each turn... use a card from your hand as a customer, which will score points at end of the round and give you an action and decreases your hand size because you don't draw a new card... or use a card in your hand as an "advertiser" which increases your character's strength so you can play customers later with higher value, but you have to draw a new card after (which is bad in that if someone goes out each card in hand is -2 points).

Some problems are in addition to the normal luck issues is that the cards are not well balanced.  Also with 6 players it took longer than the listed 30 minutes play time.  Probably best with fewer players and as this might be a decent "filler"

Very interesting game. Its confrontational (there are many cards which attack other players) and fairly simple to play. Players try to get rid of their hand while playing as many guests as possible.

Wow this game is fast and easy to learn. I own RRR and always liked the art and concept but this game plays so much better. The rules and all the abilities are very simple yet the game is very exciting and unpredictable. This is a great example of how simplicity is the key to a great game.

This really captures all the challenge and depth of MTG without all the timing/rules arguments! I hope the designer continues to explore this system in other games. 

Note- I really enjoy the theme. My girlfriend's mother sings traditional Japanese music and primarily performs with geisha so I have gotten to see the beauty and expertise of these great artists.

Pretty simple game once you get into it, don't know how much replay ability there is after getting the hang of it, but it was fun for us this evening for sure -- for the price and ease of play, definitely worth a try alone. And the art's beautiful too. We played with only 2 people and it was fun -- that's increasingly becoming important to me so hope that's helpful in a review.

On further plays -- the geishas are not balanced. If you're only playing 2 players, don't let anyone use Suzune!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Mai-Star concerns competition between geishas. The goal is to use-up your hand of cards before the other players (excess cards count negative). A significant part of the game concerns penalising other players by making them draw cards.
The cards can either be played as "advertisers" (patrons who extol the geisha's virtues) or as "patrons", which are worth victory points. Patrons can only be played if the geisha has high enough stats in one of three areas. Advertisers boost these stats. Playing cards in either way can trigger special powers, such as additional turns, or forcing cards on competitors, as noted above. There are three rounds - each one ends as soon as someone runs out of cards. Highest score across three rounds wins.
As I noted above, the artwork is beautiful, but the cards themselves seem rather flimsy. There are also significant balance problems. IIRC there are six geisha cards, all different, and two of them are much more powerful than the others. One gets an extra go each turn, and either finishes fast or gets more and more powerful over time. Another gets extra cards each turn, but has absurdly powerful basic stats.

Have had this for a while now and never got the chance or the will to try it out until a few weeks ago and am really glad I did. This game is fun and fast paced.

Wild, swingy, unbalanced, yet fun. Yes it's quite in your face, a lot more so than I initially got from reading the rules. The artwork is nice, but I prefer the original. Game plays really quickly and each players powers are "overpowered". I don't think Kanai does it quite like Chudyk, or at least it doesn't feel as "balanced". It plays up to 6, but I think 4 (...maybe 5) is probably the limit with this as it would get a bit too long in the tooth otherwise.

If it didn't have Seiji Kanai's name on it, it honestly would be rated a touch lower. I'm giving him the benifit of the doubt and assuming there is a little more to this game than initially lets on, just like Love Letter.

If you wanna play this game, study the cards in advance and explain before playing which possible cards our in the deck. I advice this, because there are some very powerful cards in there that let you discard you're entire hand (= Monk) (which finishes the round immediately) or even worse, that let's you play all you're hand cards (= Shogun) :s

So if you see a player advertising in the same colour all the time, you can imagine he's saving for a big one and you should all try to stop him/her!

In this light card game, each person plays a geisha who is vying for the greatest fame and influence. This is, of course, achieved by getting people of influence to "advertise" for you, which buffs your skills and allows you to take on more and more powerful clients. Since each geisha has different base stats and different skills the style of play can vary quite a bit from game to game. One criticism is that the game can be somewhat luck dependent. This seems to be more of a problem with fewer and less experienced players.

Supricingly fun, even with unbalanced special abilities and huge swings in points between different round (and even by one player during different rounds). Luck obviously plays a big role, too.

Hand-management. Plays 6. This game is one of the best looking card games.  Even better than Chronicle.  The game play itself is not very sophisticated and a bit swingy, but the art is just so clean and immersing for the time period.

random but pleasing.  It's nice to always have something good to do with any card, and also to have some choice on any given turn.  Luck of the draw matters a lot, but it doesn't bother me in this game much for some reason.

Still, I wish it wasn't quite so random.

This is the take-that card-play portion of Spartacus: A Game of Blood and Treachery refined into a game. Similar ideas, with cost requirements to play cards (3 tracks instead of 1, but no negotiation to joint-play cards), and the use of 'Guards' on table and reversals in hand. Plus a Rummy objective (go out first), and variable player powers.

Knowledge and tracking of the deck is key, and it's not too hard to memorize it thanks to the artwork and easy distribution.

It's an okay filler, just not one I like. I thumb my nose at games that resort to 'play 3 rounds' in order to add meat to intrinsically deficient content skeletons. Except Flash Duel, because you need the luck to even out, and the multiple rounds are built into the theme.

3+1

Another card game in the 'play a card to either score or bolster your position for future turns' genre. Think Port Royal.

This time, players play Geishas (!) trying to either get clients/patrons (VPs + special effects such as TAKE THAT ones) or put out 'advertising' (effectively bolstering their general abilities in order to lure higher-value clients).

There's abit of take that and each geisha has special abilities to activate. Player fairly quickly and the one with the most VPs at the end of three rounds wins.

Can appear complex to start with, but most of the complexity involves the powers written out on the cards. In practice the game is very simple and quick.

I find that new players are a bit handicapped, which is a problem for a game that isn't amazing enough for me to bring to groups regularly.

Neat little game, but it feels overly luck based depending on what cards you draw that synergize with your geisha. It is also a heavily "take that" type game which I'm not overly fond of... still a decent game and one that is a good time killer.

RATING: 5.5
Okay game.  The symmetry of the 'suits' I found odd, considering the individual player cards were asymmetrical.  It seems like in every game played someone explodes based upon their starting power.  I wish each color suit had a specialization of card, rather than every suit being the same.

Ever since the success of [thing=129622][/thing] people have been looking for more of the same. It's obvious why AEG would look into [person=9495][/person]s back catalog. And this game is one of those games found there. I thought it worked quite well - with a good dose of luck which you should be aware of - until the third round when it became apparent the expensive, big cards, are 'I win' cards. Once you realize that, you shouldn't be doing anything else than working to get one of those down - if you have one. Which makes the game a bit more one dimensional than I felt it was in the first round. That was a bit of a disappointment.

Initial rating: 5.5

RATING: 6.2
I feel a little like I'm giving this game the benefit of the doubt based on the first play (and the designer).

There are some black cards that seem to be massively useful and if you have one of these in your hand, you'll almost certainly win (you'll definitely win if you can play it).

As usual, the artwork is beautiful and the game was so fast, I'm willing to overlook it's flaws, but this rating could easily be +/- 3.

Update: the black cards are stupidly powerful, to the point where you should explain to people they exist when teaching the game.

Some of the geishas are also more fun to play than others; the 2-2-2 one is pretty boring as you'll probably spend 90% of the game (double) advertising. It's also pretty swingy. I was building up to play a card that would allow me to put into play all of my red cards. Another player got to look at my hand and discarded that card. This took my end of round score from 25 to zero.

The overly random nature of the game does diminish my enjoyment of it somewhat.

Rating down from 7 to 6.2.

First Impression:
Simple and fun filler game.

What I liked: Excellent artwork. Simple, quick gameplay. Enough combos to keep you interested. Variability and replayability. Very unique and working theme!

What I didn't like: I don't like take that games, and this one has tons of it. Bashing the leader and pretending not to be the leader is not my idea of fun.

I'd hapilly play this again though, the theme worked for me and it plays quick so I can forgive some kingmaking for now.

RATING: 7
The woodcut artwork & theme of competing geisha's is very charming. Choosing one from the six geisha's, the idea is to exploit her special power in building a winning tableau, each card played serving multiple purposes.

The economy driving the game are three abilities. The ability to charm guests into enjoying the cheap booze as though it were fine liquor, intelligence that invites sophisticated conversation, and enticing dance. As you develop these asymmetrical skills, they'll attract different archetypal Japanese guests - yes, including a ninja - who not only pay you but bring a one time event that goes off. 

A light, scalable game that plays very quickly but has an intriguing metagame. I find it enjoyable and innovative in a small key. It also fits well the idea of a couples game or a easygoing pub game, and one that'll charm onlookers with it's beauty and 'non-geeky' theme.

Another delightful entry by the Kanai Factory. I have played several of his creations now and I can see how his designs work. His card games are always simple in the core mechanic but each character is always loaded with abilities to bend the rules. I feel that he has done justice to these abilities by exhaustive playtesting. The abilities, while asymmetric, always feel balanced during gameplay. I have played Mai-Star recently and while at the onset of the game, a character appears quite weak, they are quite capable of coming from behind to seize victory with the right card draw. It is true that his card games also require a fair amount of luck, Love Letter is one such example. A player can be ousted on the first round by sheer guessing. Mai-Star is a little more complicated and feels more polished. The Geishas' abilities are all quite balanced and are capable of winning the game with the proper card draw. Two thumbs up for this gem.

102113: Fun,simple and really awesome art makes this filler a keeper. The scores can swing quite wildly if no one takes on the leader EACH round and not from previous rounds. A 30 point swing is entirely possible and it doesn't bother me as much which is odd. One reason is that i always feel a chance to snatch a comeback victory if I am able to play a high card. Hope is for suckers I suppose

A decent take-that game, a bit too long to be considered a filler...

Pros: 

- Good art and design

- Interesting hand-management mechanics

Cons:

- 3 rounds with no carry-over between rounds

- The "free advert every turn" character is clearly overpowered

Simple yet interesting card game with over-powered cards that balance each other out. Players get one geisha at the start; each geisha having different attribute values and a special ability. Players are dealt cards representing characters, and the goal is to have as many characters as possible visit the geisha as guests. However, the geisha has to have enough in the required attribute for the characters to visit her as guests, so instead they can be played as advertisers, increasing the geisha's stats. However, when you play an advertiser you have to draw a card; the round ends when somebody runs out of cards, and all cards in hand is a penalty at the round end. That, combined with the special effect a character has when played as guest, forms a tilting game back and forth where card combinations can be rather crazy.

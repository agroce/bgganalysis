A must have. This game is conceived and designed according to a model of ancient warfare historically accurate. Activation, system, morale checks, rally attempts are unique and again, way more realistic than the majority of the games out there.
The quality material is excellent, it is worth the money. Not my favorite game, I still prefer GBoH but still a true GEM in my opinion.

I've been playing Phil Sabin's various designs - Phalanx, Legion, Strategos II - for some time.  But it all comes together here.  As I enjoy recreating historical battles this certainly does it for me.  The rules appear to be simple, but have enough tweeks to make sure I usualy forget at least one each time!  I can see those who want to set up their own battle, and like micro detail ('They have heavy pila so are outranged by the light javalins my troops have') will dislike the broad brush approach Phil uses.  Given the state of the evidence for ancient warfare the LB approach means that  means so many niggling questions such as the above no longer need worrying about.  Production wise after I opened the box I spent the first ten minutes just stroking the bits!

A nice attempt but a failure as a game. Too schematic, too bland and too many modifiers. If this is supposted to be scientific why point units exist in line formation battles.

Maybe the book is worthwile reading, but if I look at the price...

RATING: 8
A simulation that tries to emulate the broad tactical sweep of ancient battles. Very different from many war games. Lots of historical research has gone into this and is fully explained in the accompanying book. The game gives a strong narrative; some scenarios seem to have more tactical options than others. To make it more of a game, it's certainly worth adding in deployment once you've understood the basic rules, as that adds a lot more choice; also using Favour of the Gods, and I suggest an average die for the additional command points roll.

For those who like playing wargames solo (i.e. playing both sides), I think this would be an absolutely excellent game for doing that.

I know that it is both hyperbole, as well as cliche, but I feel that Lost Battles takes the concept of ancient tactical western warfare and sets a new standard for other games to emulate.  This is not to say that it is the "best game ever," not when there are so many other good titles available to us.  But the depth and scope of the thinking that made this game is impressive.

Luxury materials, classy and elegant mechanisms. Not being an Antiquity expert, I bought this (costly) game to learn and explore, and it perfectly delivers. I guess some aficionados will be disappointed by the generic troops and the demonstrating-oriented mechanisms (you will endure what you expect from Turn 1 when you put your army on the tiles), but it really meets my taste for clarity when I want to study while playing.

Playing through the hoplite era battles right now and i'm liking it.  

More on the simulation/model side than being a pure game.  It solo's well (especially if you use historical deployments) and allows interesting recreations of the battles.  Very large scale and abstract, but with enough chrome to make it interesting.  

Reminds me a little of the DBx series of miniatures games, but without the fiddly-ness.

A different approach to depiction of ancient battles, that has endured some criticism on that score.  I personally think it is an excellent game, and a very good insight to what made the difference between these various armies, without leaving everything unfactored for the player.  I do think the rules are much longer than necessary, and not particularly well-organized.

Faces the age-old dilemma of "simulation or game?", and comes out of it as a simulation, with some game aspects. Lots of chrome (specific fiddles, exclusions, bonuses, and/or penalties depending on unit type/actions), requiring a fair amount of chart-checking. Morale system is single roll (for the whole army!) with lots of individual unit modifiers, but not as bad as it sounds (lots of "they'll all be the same..." realisations.

I prefer to play C&C:Ancients, but Lost Battles is certainly a better research/study experience.  Just not as much fun, IMHO :-)

RATING: 8
After 2 games played (Marathon scenario - once as each side) I am pretty hopeful about this. The game felt 'right' in terms of recreating the dificulties of ancient combat, despite the abstractions the game design makes.

I think the game will really come into it's own when played by two opponents who know the game well - the modifiers, with their various exceptions, for combat and morale checks do make for a halting experience when first played.

Rolling low on a morale check can be devastating - the difference between your army being largely unaffected and most of it routing from the map. Given the huge swing that can happen on a single die roll, I'm not convinced that you shouldn't be allowed to use the 'Favour of the God's' on morale roles as well as combat.

Excellent study of ancient warfare, at first the map and counters are seemingly abstract, especially with the orthogonal movement system, but after a few plays you'll realize that all aspects of terrain, diagonal movement, ancient units were tightly integrated into the mechanics within the rules.  Its absolutely elegant and innovative.  Tonnes of fun, fast to setup.  Excellent simulation.

P.S. Its much much better historical simulation than C&C Ancients.  After just a couple of games of Lost Battles, you'll be addicted.

Tip:  Download the user made player-aids here on BGG, they are excellent and almost essential compliment to the player-aid included with the game.  http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/72086/my-players-aid

UPDATE
I've read the book and played the Marathon battle solo. 
Interesting. For now some of the nuances of the system elude me. I understand that most people will find this game unreasonably complex, not to say convoluted. 
I like it as it is, but for now choices seem a little low as the inflexible nature of the warfare is well portrayed. But is this also a fun game?
As for now I'm hooked and want to play again. I envision the battlefield and the things I've done and could have done differently. In a way it looks like a toolbox to tinker with and explore many different hypothesis and outcomes. 

UPDATE
I like this game. Even if I think that there's a low possibility of influencing the battlefield once the wheels are set in motion. 
For now this is an "8" for me. 

UPDATE
I read the amendments to the rules, and the introduction of the die roll for command points after the expenditure of the other points is going to add a lot of tough choices and excruciating tension to the game.
This is going up to a "9"!!

UPDATE
I finally cracked. Not only this game is relatively simple, it also packs a lot of tension in a tight and historically plausible way. 
I'm really an enthusiast of this system and an unashamed fan.  

UPDATE
I've ordered the separate rules and charts! How happy I am! :D

lost battles is a gem... with some production drawbacks. 

Professor Sabin struggled with scarce datas and scolarship guesswork to convey a "method" to portray ancient battles in relatively simple and historically accurate way. 

I think this method as much to pay to statistically based quantitative approches applied to social sciences and correctly Sabin realizes it.

But Sabin choose a peculiar approach, something who can give an "insight": the dynamic approach, the "game". 

Lost battles is a game based on a sound method, I think it is one of the very few in the market in decades.
In this game the players take the roles of ancient ARMY commanders (not ancient soldiers or even junior officiers) and face the same grand tactical problems (a part of been shot at... of course) they had, expecially regarding command, troops movement and casualties/morale. 

These three elements are modeled in a simple but quite interesting game system which blends game play, chance and proper army management in a very satisfactory way, mirrored in a complex but interesting way to measure your performance in respect to the "victory condictions": you can win a game "tactically", forcing the opponent to quit the field of battle but if you have managed also to destroy YOUR army... the victory, in a broader sense, isn't upon you!

Replay value is high, not only because you have 40 scenarios ready to play. 
Every army behave in a different way depending on the predominance of a weapons system/tactics; so when you play with an oplite based army you have to tail your tactics in a different way in respect to a legion, a persian army, a chariot army and so on. 
the "approach turn", the first turn of every scenario, lends variability to the set-up, so every battle you play it's different from another one.
The game do have a scenario generator in it... and a gorgeous one! the bonus strategic game it a stand alone game, but it lends perfectly as an endless scenario generator for Lost Battles.

Game's play depends, obviously, on the size of the battle but it tends to stay in the 2-3 hours range.

Lost Battles is a miniature system evolved in a boardgame. If you want play this with your minis (6mm are the best choice in my opinion...) you can use the counters of the game and past the minis strip over it... it looks great!

But I'm dissatisfied with the production of the game, so I rate this a 8,5 and not a 10. 

I'm an italian wargamer, I played these games for more than 30 years and I read currently english (writing in it is a different matter...). 
Reading the rules was a chore: they are written in a perfect english but... are too wordy for my taste and the continuos referencing to the book is disappointing (I've read the book before...). 
40 page of rules for a game you can teach a friend in 15 minutes it's too much, and this facet deprives the merits of the game, in my opinion. 

I think this game definitely needs a summary of the rules in 3-4 pages format or a youtube tutorial.

The physical components are great at the first sight, but the rule book and the player aids are too lighty. 
In particular, the rule book deserve an heavy cover and frame. 
the tiles are great... but they have different tones of green on the back side; and have a weird tendency to "warp" if you leave the game flat on a surface for more than 2 days!!! 
I placed the tiles back in the box and after a week three of them are still warped. This is a problem the production manager have to resolve, 'cause it deprives this great game very much and does not justifies its high cost.  
The counters, nevertheless, looks better in "the real world" than on the internet: they are the best components of the game.

Going to be released in August 2011.  Preorder price is up for BP54.95 from Fifth Column Games here: http://www.fifthcolumngames.co.uk/LBpreorder.html

The designer wrote an article about the game in Battles magazine #6 Into the Bastards! It is worthy of a read and it makes the game more appealing.

This expensive game finally arrives after 6 months of preorder!  Holy weight! The writing is scholarly but absorbing and entertaining.  A lot of food for thoughts.  I love it at first reading!

How does the game play?  I was not totally satisfied with Great Battles of History (better with SGBoH though) because it put me more into the shoes of leaders in tactical units rather than the overall commander on the field of the day, e.g. Alexander or Darius.  I was not totally satisfied with Command and Colors either because it is more a game than a simulation - it does not give me a sense of reality.  After playing 3 scenarios of Lost Battles in a row, I can safely say that it is the BEST of both worlds!

After choosing the scenarios, each side is allocated a number of command points, which is determined according to 1/10 of the total Fighting Value of the army.  So a larger army would be given more command points.  A larger army doesn't necessarily have the initiative on the battle field though as it is determined by the scenario with the side on the left always going first.  

For example in Marathon, the Athenians have 63 FV and so they have 6 command points in the beginning.  Total command points are further halved if the conditions of the battle field is wet or dusty.  You spend each command point to activate a group of units or units individually.  A die is rolled when the command point is reduced down to one or zero the first time.  The die roll result would add that number of additional command points to the side.  A player continues his turn until he spends all the command points to resolve movement or combat or until all units being activated.  The other player then do the same.  So Lost Battles sequence of play is a basic I-go-U-go structure but wait a minute, this system is realistic and fun!  I feel that I was able to act like the overall commander.  

There are three types of activations - normal, limited and express.  The interesting bit is that in each different types of activations, they cost you different number of commands and then there are different  restrictions.  For example, in a normal activation, you spend one command to activate a single unit or a group of "veteran" units but you have to spend two command for any other group, i.e. not veteran class units (see how veteran units are factored in as they are "easier" to command and activate).  For the activated cavalry units, they receive two "actions", one for other type of units.  Since actions are spent to move, attack or change facing, the cavalry can therefore "charge" after making the move, while the infantry can only stop after moving into the next tile.  In a limited activation (cost 1 command), a group of any size can be activated.  A unit in the group can be assigned as the "lead unit" which can move and then attack, while the remaining units can follow the lead unit but cannot attack.  In an express activation, it costs 2 commands for a single unit of any type, 1 for a veteran unit.  The above sounds a bit complicated as it seem.  With player aid in the game as well as those in BGG here, soon they are just "natural" to the flow of the game!         

Attack is resolved with reference to a very important Combat Table, in which combat effectiveness differential is expressed as a number.  The number is lower if a type of attacking unit is more effective against a certain type of defending unit.  For example, the number is 9 if heavy infantry is attacking heavy infantry but 8 if it is attacking heavy cavalry.  

To resolve a combat, you roll two dice and then modify the result with a number of factors.  The most common ones are +1 for the combat bonus (with spending of a command point), non-levy unit attacking levy unit, lead unit attacking downhill, and the more curious one to me - hoplites attacking hoplites who did not just enter the tile.  This is an interesting way to increase the more bloody results between hoplites ferocity.  The final dieroll result is then compared to the combat effectiveness differential number.  For a positive combat differential of 1 or 2, one hit is inflicted; two hits if 3 and the attacker chooses to conduct an all-out attack (for fresh unit, not reduced "spent" unit); or two hits if 3 above.     
   
A morale check is required when a unit is eliminated, i.e. it has been inflicted two hits or more.  It goes to the "shattered" state and other units on the map have to go for a morale check to see if they go panic.  You roll two dice and halve the one with the lower number.  The result is adjusted by the Army morale (basically a comparison of the size of the Armies on the board).  It is further adjusted by Unit morale according to the class of the unit, distance to the battle just taken place, fresh or spent status of the unit etc.  A negative result would cause the unit to panic and rout.  If the result is zero, the unit would go panic only if it is in the same hex of the battle.      

Victory Points are tallied at the end of turn 10 or when all units from a side are removed from the map.  The total fighting value of all spent, withdrawn leader or routed enemy units are the VPs. Each shattered unit worth 2 times the fighting value of the unit while each other routed unit earns additional one VP.  Remember the handicap rules on the calculation of VPs though.  It is because even though all of your units have gone after morale check, if you have inflicted enough casualties on your opponent, you still have a chance to victory.  I think this is an excellent idea to balance the gameplay and historicity, in which your performance is gauged strictly against the performance of your own historical counterpart.    

If you use the historical deployments given in the game (here is the only quibble I found with Lost Battles - the historical deployment map is too small for two players to read at the same time!), you start the scenario on turn two.  Otherwise, you can always choose to use free deployment rules, which is encouraged by the game designer Philip Sabin himself, as the design is built up from free deployment premises. 
 
There are so many scenarios to choose from in this package that it is simply a pure fun in itself choosing the one for a game.  There are individual campaign rules which link the given scenarios altogether. Different level of victory and defeat are determined after the end of the scenario. Campaign victory points are awarded to the players according to the respective levels who completed the scenarios. This way, even if you lost one scenario, you still have a chance to come back in a campaign by winning the remaining scenarios.  

There are still many chromes that I haven't touched upon yet.  For examples, there are many leaders in the game as it covers a lot of history.  There is a system called "Empire Strategic Game" that links the game (essentially a tactical game) to a strategic aspect. I expect the system, just like many other chromes in this game, would enrich the main system and gameplay system only much more, not less.  Overall, I couldn't stop recommending this game to anyone who has the interest in the ancient period, whether your are a board wargamer or miniature wargamer.  Grab a copy while stock lasts!  This is THE game if you ever only bring one copy of ancient wargame to Robinson's Island. The game is an everlasting glory in itself - value expounded if you manage to get a copy of the accompanying book as well. It proves that academic wargame designer can also work, not just dry number-crunching military wargame or commercial wargame.  It captures the best of both world.  Yes, the bar is raised again. Lost Battles is a perfect illustration of how to combine both simulation and game together. (And no, I am an independent wargamer and I bought this game with my own hard-earned money.)

Decent not-too-complicated system that gives a reasonable rendition of ancients battles.  1 point deducted for the silly sideways-pointing phalanxes on the counters, if you go for the miniatures-with-grass-lookalike look, then at least make the pikes point in the same direction.   Don't understand why a relatively simple set of rules had to be fattened up to this novella of a rulebook.  Overpriced and overheavy.  However it is better history than GBOH and slightly better than C&C:A.  Not a bad job on a topic where combining historicity and gameplay still has eluded most designers.

Disclaimer #1: I worked for the author as teaching assistant, the author had been my 2nd supervisor during my PhD, I known him personally and I like him. 

It is an ambitious and well researched attempt to use games to reconstruct ancient battles. The game itself as several good mechanics and produces a decent narrative but has also several flaws. It is too abstract, the squares do not give you a good visual narrative, some design decisions are debatable, and there is no chance for cavalry wing disappearing in hot pursuit. 

I have three main gripes: the first is that as much I like the system and its abstraction I am not enamored of the loss of visual representation of battle lines. The squares and how the units are arranged in them (and the physical counters) tend to look a bit abstract compared to GBOH.  The second gripe is the crappy balance system. IMHO the balance system, being generic and hard wired in the rules rather than crafted for each battle, tends sometime to produce unbalanced results. I have seen this especially in Roman Civil War battles and in Caesar Battle against the evil Gauls. The last one is the combat system. Based on average results and large scale effects it tends to be boring and more often than not involving a lot of die rolling (thanks Ares only two D6 not buckets) often for nothing. I agree that in the end the results are believable and you can create a good narrative and explain the outcomes, but it is boring. 

These are minor gripes that does not detract from the real enjoyment of the game.

Yet I have a major negative point. The deluxe edition is pleasant to the eye even if I do not like the visual abstractions but over priced for today economic times, IMHO. I know that Phil and Daniel are not cheater, but look this way as much the component are indeed lavish the price today is outside the pocket of a lot of gamers (Disclaimer #2: I got my copy at a strong discount). Coupled with the fact that additional printings are not likely at the moment the net result is that we have an excellent game that could be used to teach ancient warfare and to introduce people to serious ancient wargaming that is almost out of reach.

Said that I think that in terms of realism Lost Battles is just behind GBOH (full) and probably the same as simple GBOH. It is not as accurate in its representation of the processes but does a good job to simulate the overall outcome. Where Lost Battles shine is playing time. Even large battles can be played quickly. This is very important when you are using the game as teaching tools. We (me and Professor Sabin) have used it for 4 years in class with the battle of Cannae and not only we had always completed the game, but had plenty of time for discussion with the students.

A little difficult to learn at first but well worth it if you are interested in the time period. I recommend reading his book fully before trying to tackle the rulebook.

The game has lots of fresh ideas and great production quality - but- I've found it too be a little dull at times. The tactics and strategy are sound but it's lacking the epic quality I expected. The game improves with custom Deployment... The historical deployment takes to many of the interesting choices away from you.

Warning - this wass primarily developed as a way to accurately recreate and study historical battles. If studying historical battles isn't your thig then stay away. This game leanes more towards education the pure entertainment.

I have actually purchased the Hardback version of the enclosed book from Amazon and it is a well thought-out tome and an inspiring read. I have now received TWO copies (Don't ask) of Lost Battles.  The production values are excellent and, being basically a figure gamer, the system allows me the closest experience to fielding several miniature ancient armies as I can get without the expense of buying and painting metal. I have always loved ancient wargaming and studying ancient history but, because of the scope that covers centuries rather than decades, could never afford to start collecting 28mm figures since I don't believe in playing ahistorical games using point systems.

Thoroughly deserves the 10 for the game system and the production values.

A clever game that seems to achieve a lot of depth on a simple chassis. Far less intimidating to play than it first looks this is easy to learn and fast to play. Phil Sabin clearly knows his onions and eschews detail to provide a grand tactical model for verifying known information against historical results.

My one and only complaint is Mark Mahaffey's counter graphics that get lost against the tiled background.

I've grown tired of complex historical miniatures rules.  This lets me get lead out on the table and play large battles in a short period of time.

Also, as a historian myself, I really appreciate Prof Sabin's thorough research and the game as an extension of historical methodology.

Ich kann freilich nicht bezweifeln, daß in dieses Spiel jahrelange Forschung eingegangen ist. Das Resultat: Die Spielfreude geht ein. Die schiere Anzahl von Würfelmodifikatoren und Ausnahmen verlangsamt das Gameplay und gestaltet eine Partie zu einer Proseminar-Arbeit: Sie vermittelt ein paar Erkenntnisse, ohne wirklich spannend zu sein. Ob der Erkenntnisgewinn höher ist als etwa bei Commands&Colors, wage ich dennoch zu bezweifeln.

Played only Marathon and Leuctra solo, but it looks like a solid system to recreate ancient battles. The rulebook is hard to assimilate, it's not written in a standard rulebook style*, but it's like a history book. The rules are not presented by steps of difficulty, everything is presented as a full piece, giving some concepts as granted.
For example the concept of "Fatigued" is found along the way but a glossary is missing, so you understand its meaning only when you reach chapter 12 "Scenarios". As suggested on the yahoo group the best way to learn is try to play without worry about the thousands of modifiers and exceptions. A good game.


*For me the standard rulebook is written by Chad Jensen

I`m enchanted by Lost Battles. It`s not a game on ancient battles, rather sort of intellectual vehicle/tool to explore particular battle situations. As GBoH player I`m amazed that most of my sessions in LB take no more time than 2 hours.

Ruleset is very different than what I`m accustomed to, but that doesn`t mean it is bad - it just means that after several battles I`m still not sure if I`ve got all details and procedures right. For any kind of problem there is a helpful community though.

The best thing for me personally is inclusion of several hoplite battles which have clearly their own flavor. In GBoH I`ve often felt that hoplites are a liability, in LB they`re a force to be reckoned with.

I hope to find some time in the future to create my own scenarios, which doesn`t look to difficult - that`s another virtue of LB.

update (9/12): i trust it'll be worthwhile eventually. but in the meantime, UGH. i want to cry. the rules presentation needs an overhaul and a ruthless editor. i got this early in the year, tried to read the rules, but got lost in the constant references to other rules. (a slight exaggeration, but it's like, "do this, except during this case (see 3.4) and this other case (see 7.5) when this other event happens (see 8.8) while there's a full moon on an empty stomach."...whuuut? 

i'm a technical writer by trade so to read this is like hearing nails dragged across a chalkboard. i feel compelled to mark it up with a red pen. the constant word-fat doesn't help (eg, a rule that could be stated in five words is told in 10 or 20.) i swear, the rules give the boomerang effect where reading an ASL rule book is a relief! 

worst part is that even w/ the $$$ deluxe edition, there's little in the box to help new players along. to add salt on the wound, you get this 70-odd page tabloid that takes the 20 pages of rules from the text's appendix and interrupts it with what feels like 10 hours of director's commentary DVD. it's completely unreadable, especially since the text column spreads across the entire magazine-width page. seriously, who does that? horrific page design.

nevertheless, i'm on a second try now (sticking to the text's appendix this time). it's still maddening, but i have faith that there's a decent game on the other side....

getting it ready for the table. my mid-life crisis bday gift to myself. was looking for an alternative to C&C:A that was more thematic and with a more-satisfying narrative. it also sounds like it addresses a void in wargames: one that scales from the grand-strategic to the grand-tactical.

Clever, elegant, accurate, and a labour of love. Still, more of a simulation than a proper game, except for a few historically balanced scenarios. For instance, with the Greeks, once your hoplites are deployed on the battlefield, there's not much you can do with them other than advance and hit hard, right ahead. So, most of the pre-set battles are perhaps not that interesting as a game.

Played around two dozens games with hardback rules book
and 3 with boxed set.

It seems at first that it is difficult to get all various movement and battle details right. But after two or three games its all settled in the head.

- Game mechanics is completely different from "conventional" wargames approaches and gives very unique feel about it.
- Each game is very tense
- You do feel like an ancient general while playing. You think in terms of real battlefield. There is no micromanagement.
- You can win even if you completely annihilated due to handicap system which leaves intrigue in most unbalanced fights
- System is very deep. So there is long process of mastering it.
- Complete softback Lost Battles book coming together with the game. This is itself very good read on obscure topic of modeling ancient battles.

[COLOR=#CC0033][b]For the enthusiast of ancient warfare this is a remarkable package.  A simulation and game in one that allows players to recreate ancient battles based on the available historical evidence.  You not only get the game itself with first class components you also get the book the game is based on, containing the inside story of the game mechanics and the logic behind it all. This is an exceptional production and gaming experience.  One of my all time favorites. [/b][/COLOR]

Takes a bit of time to get use to the modifiers but is quite a good simulation of ancient warfare.  the handicap system is an interesting concept that can see a 'loser' actually win (but in a way that reflects an army fleeing a battle relatively intact).

I'm not 100% sold on this as a game.  As a simulation tool it seems excellent.  And make no mistake, I've very much enjoyed playing it.  But going by the book, it's hard for me to say how much influence I actually have on the outcomes of battles.  I worry that over time the game will be reduced to:
1. March troops straight ahead.
2. Roll dice on the off chance that the underdog gets lucky.
3. Calculate the victor.
This is certainly not the case in scenarios with deployment rules (nor for games using the optional "Always deploy" approach.
My other minor complaint is the terrain tiles -- they can be hard to distinguish at a glance, and trying to line up the rivers and streams is a pain -- why couldn't they all meet at the center of the tile, Carcassonne-style?
Beyond those complaints, it's a fast-playing game with a terrific feel.  The morale system is brilliant and leads to a great deal of tension -- how hard can you push those spent hoplites before the whole line starts to crumble?
As it stands, it's clearly a labor of love that I'm proud to own.

Lost Battles does not use hidden information, therefore it plays well solo. It already includes many scenarios (listed on the [[Lost Battles]] wiki page), so an expansion is not needed.
With rules that are not too complicated and its short setup and play times it fits perfectly in my busy schedule.
And it looks beautiful!

I've played Lost Battles off and on for the last couple of years now, and my evaluation of it has wobbled between "excellent" and "perfect". The game is unique in its treatment of ancient battles, and thus difficult to compare to others. But I think I'm settling in at a 9.5 - not quite perfect, but really quite remarkable.

So what unique strengths does Lost Battles have? Several, but maybe the most significant is its choice of a grand tactical scale - a step removed from most ancients wargames. For veterans of other games, LB can seem far too abstract at first - there are no short range missile attacks, explicit formations, precise troop positions, or exploitable holes in the enemy line. At first this just seemed coarse to me, but I eventually realized it serves two important purposes. 

First, as described at length in the accompanying book, it's more true to the little we actually know about these battles. Extant sources are vague and often contradictory, so the designer's approach is first to develop a plausible large scale model based on surveying the entire era's battles. He then uses that model's implications to supplement and evaluate the sources' details of troop numbers, qualities, and positions. Compared to other games, it's a very humble approach to the history. Rather than make a historical judgment and design a scenario around that, the designer encourages players to tweak details of troops and deployment to explore historical ambiguities - and the scale makes it effortless to do this.

The second main benefit of the game's scale is how well it puts the player into the role of battlefield commander. You might choose to have an entire wing of your army hold back, or to have another one press harder in combat to try for a breakthrough, but you don't order Hoplite Unit C to advance 20 paces. The focus is always on the bigger picture. This is closely related to the game's design-for-effect approach, unusual in ancients games. It's not, for example, "How should skirmishers work given what we know about skirmishers?" It's "How should skirmishers work in order to make the overall results plausible?" There are individual rules that seem awkward or arbitrary on their own but ultimately encourage armies to behave historically. Unlike other games I've played at smaller scales, I never feel like the rules let me "game the system" by using units in ahistorical ways to gain an edge on a combat modifier. And when I sit down to research a battle further after a game, I can see the same choices I focused on in the game reflected in the historical accounts.

Lost Battles certainly has other strengths beyond its choice of scale - the morale system is innovative and dramatic, free deployment allows for incredible replayability, and the leadership rules do a credible job of modeling the impact of generals and champions without much effort. But in comparing Lost Battles to other competing titles, it's the scale that's the most noticeable difference and the one with the most implications.

So what's not good here? Primarily, it's that the game's novel perspective breaks some expectations of a wargame and leads to some clumsy rules. As noted above, getting past the apparent lack of detail in the scale is the first part. But another consequence of that scale is that players can feel like spectators to the die rolls, especially once the battle is joined after the initial jockeying for position. There *are* important choices to made throughout - one should not underestimate the value of paying for a combat modifier or of properly sequencing their army's attacks. But it's not quite the same as coming up with a brilliant strategem to exploit some subtlety of the enemy's position. Once the battle is joined, you're playing small ball to incrementally improve your odds. 

The rules are a bit different story. They're fundamentally simple, and the game plays quickly (two hours or less). But you definitely feel how the game was developed from an academic, modeling perspective rather than a typical gamer one. There are a lot of exceptions or subtleties in places you don't expect, sometimes with important strategic implications (how key zones interact with rivers, for example). And the combat system, fundamentally just a 2d6 with a target value, is burdened with an enormous list of wordy modifiers that do most of the game's modeling of troop types and terrain. I've played a couple dozen games of this now, and while I can get to the point of playing fast, I don't think I'll ever get to the point of the game feeling *smooth*.

Overall, the occasional clunks in the rules are the only thing that keeps this game from being perfect for me. It's reasonably fast to set up and play, provides genuine insight into history, and includes a vast range of scenarios. If I were to keep only a single ancients wargame in my collection, Lost Battles would be an easy pick. Even with the game now OOP, there's simply no other title that fills this niche, and the game's huge scenario selection, high replayability, and great production values make it well worth hunting down.

Well I am not normally one to gush - but after 8+ plays both solo and face-to-face and I have yet to find anything about this game I do not like. The components and gameplay are both excellent and the speed and depth at which it plays is refreshing. A very solid 9 for now but on current form this might be going up soon...

Итак, уже опубликованы примеры боя и "имперского режима", но правил нет, а понятно мало.

И всетаки у меня есть предчувствие, что эта игра окажется именно той игрой. Скажем C&C:Ancients у меня не создает ощущения что я играю в настоящую битву, не напоминает мне то, что я читал в книгах. А вот Lost Battles  - напоминает. Но пока это касается только баталий.

Имперский же режим совсем непонятен. С одной стороны очень любопытно увидеть как тактические битвы связываются друг с другом и создают еще большую картину происходящего. Но пока сложилось впечатление, что битвы генерятся почти случайно, а в битве по-прежнему важно лишь кто победил, и не важно как. Нет никакой связи между двумя битвами. Равно как и не видно связи между битвой и империей, и между империей и битвой. Тут пока ощущения странные. Хотя карта красивая, как и все остальное.

Somehow this system just isn't doing anything for me and yet I appreciated the tremendous amount of work Professor Sabin has put into this project.

I'm still looking for that elusive tactical Ancients Battles system that I can live with. This one is nearly what I wanted except the canvass is drawn with too wide a brush.

In the end, its those large tiles that I just can't stand. I want an Ancients battle 'to look' linear, and this system fails miserably at that. The system makes linear tactics work but it just doesn't look right.

Tons of scenarios in this thing and as the label claims you can do almost any ancients battle with it. Just wasn't my cup of tea.

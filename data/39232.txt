MY GAME OF THE YEAR 2010

Richly thematic exploration of the novel '20,000 Leagues Under the Sea'.

Nice components, good replayability. Would reccomend to Verne fans in general and solitaire fans in particular.

One of the few games who's rating I have upwardly revised (7 -> 8)

One of my favorite solitaire games.  Programmed a VASSAL module for it so I didn't have to wait for table space to open up!  Also created my own expansions.  Great decisions and lots of options for replay.  Have always loved the 20,000 Leagues story, so another winning theme.

Not at all a State of Siege game.  This is one of the most original titles put out by VPG.  I am barely familiar with the source material.  If I were, this would probably get another point.  Lots of replayability with this one, as you can select various goals, which in turn, determine what objectives score victory points.

This is one of the best solitaire game I have ever played. Nemo's War is based off the sci-fi novel, and it sucks you right in to the world of Captain Nemo. 

You command the Nautilus and move from sea to sea, destroying warships, searching for treasure, building notoriety, and more. You can also upgrade the weapons, defense, and other aspects of your ship by salvaging enemy ships that you defeat. There is a lot to this game, but very quick to learn. 

You can choose between 4 different goals when you first start the game, so the gameplay always feels different depending on which goals you decide to accomplish. There are also many different actions you can take each turn. The game is extremely quick to learn, but will take quite a while before you master it. This is a very fun adventure that should not be missed. I highly recommend it.

Initial Impression: My copy of this game was the VPG ziplock edition. Overall, I was unimpressed with the quality of the components. Having read the rules and played a single session, I have to admit that I was unimpressed to the point that I traded my copy of the game away. I'm not sure I can identify what it was about my experience that deterred me from the game. Overall the game felt entirely too predetermined and my decisions felt inconsequential. It was almost like playing a "Choose You Own Adventure", but in boardgame format. It was as if the game had been scripted and things would unfold a specific way based on my choices. I may revisit this game at some point in the future, especially since a reprint has been Kickstarted, but I'm in no hurry.

Just acquired 9/2010

This is a tough game for me to rate.  On the one hand, it is not really a wargame per se and I did not find the solitaire system to be as good as some other games (nor as challenging).  For comparison, I would say that the Toe-to-Toe Nuclear Combat game also made by VP to be more challenging.

On the other hand, I do like the game because it is fun!  And, it is not really trying to be more than fun, IMO.  In my youth, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea really caught my imagination and it is one of the earliest stories I can recall from when I was a kid.  So in that sense, it is fun to be like Captain Nemo and act out his adventures.

Bottom line: this is a game I will play from time to time, but not one that I would consider a must.

Decent solo boardgame that puts you in Captain Nemo's boots from 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. Translates the novel to boardgame format pretty well, i.e. events show up as event cards. I like how you can decide at the beginning on what you (Nemo) want to focus on, and the game will award victory points based on how far you go in achieving those goals. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Easy to learn and play but not a game of simple decisions. Solid rules and good theme.

You can choose from 4 "motivations" for Nemo. Each path emphasises different VP gathering choices.

Meaty enough to keep you engaged from game to game, at least until I hit Triumph in at least one motivation or maybe Success in each.  

It gets a 7 mostly because using the BGG ranking system I'd preferring face to face game, so I wouldn't suggest it over another game.

RATING: 2
Dry, tedious, and not as thematic as I would have hoped.
If designers make a solitaire game very hard to win (not necessarily good in any way, but simply hard to win) then somehow a great number of players seem to like it for that reason alone.
Overhyped to say the least. 

Played a long time ago and would not have bothered to rate this, but I saw people are shelling out 67$ to get the 2nd edition of this via Kickstarter. 67$ for a solo game with relatively few and inexpensive components... Let the buyer beware...

Great game with high replayability. It feels like a "real" game, meaning it's not the kind of solitaire game that makes you feel like you're just spinning your wheels doing the same thing over and over again. Your can explore the seas, subvert the imperialists, or go down in a storm of gunsmoke and cannons. Theme comes through loud and clear, and it's got enough compelling decisions to keep you interested from start to finish. UPDATE: Having played more solo games, this one is truly a standout. Upgraded to an 8.

A nice solitaire system and a great and unique subject to cover.  I like that there are different motivations that you can try on different games, and even an opportunity to switch motivations once during the game.  The "exert" mechanic for wagering your crew or hull is also very clever and, I think, original.  The components are nothing special and I'll probably hack together my own Vassal version of this, which will be easier to play with, but the game is quite nice.

This game really is about making the right decision at the right time. While most of the decision games tend to be prone to AP, this game makes you move forward without hesitation.
Due to the large portion of unknowns (ships, events & tests) you do have to re-evaluate your strategy constantly, yet this doesn't feel like a burden. Because you CAN prepare for these unknowns.

Update after 17 plays:
This game simply deserves a 10. I never ever got bored during all my plays, and I reckon the next 17 plays are just around the corner.

A very engaging solitare adventure that enjoys enhanced replayability due to the multiple paths to victory. The theme comes through in every aspect of the game from the flavor text on the cards to Captain Nemo's wavering determination.

I love the idea of this game.  However I'm just not sold on the true "solo" wargame.  I like two sides that play differently.  There's a lot of maintenance here, I sometimes feel like I'm babysitting the game.

That's personal taste though.  I do really appreciate the game's design and I'm glad I own it.  I imagine it will hit the table every now and then for something different.

-UPDATE-

Travelling for business has got me playing this one more and I find myself far more enamored with it.  It really does offer a full, satisfying solo gaming experience in a small package.  The more you play it, the more the game comes to life and the narrative takes shape.  I very much enjoy that aspect of it.

Played the game only once, so this is a first impression rating.

Rules are clear, the turn sequence is simple but they are many things to take into account since you can take only one action each turn.

Keeping imperialism at bay seems to be one of the keys of the game since losing control of the seas ends the game before week 52 and costs 50 VP.

The game is tense and not as randomly driven as one could think.

I'm not usually keen on solitaire games, but I decided to take a flyer on this one, especially as I'm attracted to the Jules Verne classic. 

Well, I was very pleasantly surprised. The biggest issue with solo games tends to be replayability, and it looks like this one might have legs. Of course, that might only last for 20-30 plays, but even then, at an hour a game, that's a lot of bang for the buck.

A good and thematic game, good balance between luck and strategy. Great theme and got me to start reading the book a few days ago. For me it's a game that deserves praise, although it's still a light game that tends to get boring after a play or two and returns to my table after several months or so, just like Astra Titanus. Definitely better than mediocre Ottoman Sunset though. I'm going to play it again soon, for the first time with the expansion and see how it will hold up.

RATING: 3
Of all my VPG games this is my least favorite. I don't feel any great sense of tension when playing it or a sense of accomplishment for beating it.

 The ability to gamble resources is a great design concept but is seemed to make the game too easy. That gambling aspect was the only real excitement in the game... The combat and exploration seemed undramatic.

I think I was expecting this to be dramatic like a "states of seige" game rather then a casual trek around the world.

My main problem with the game was its interpretation of the theme. I expected a high adventure romp around the world but instead the game revolved around killing anything and everything you meet. I felt more like a German u-boat captain than an adventurer and always felt bad about all the innocents I was killing just for some cheap victory points. Just not a feel good game. I liked the struggle against madness but sinking whole fleets of warships and merchant ships clashed with what I expected the game to be.

RATING: 8
Very nifty.  The epilogue is such a nice touch.  (You can play with several different goals in the game, and the epilogue chart is a paragraph that explains how the story ends, cross-referencing your goal and your victory level.)

RATING: N/A
A solitaire game (and as of this writing my only one) based on the Jules Verne classic, "20 Thousand Leagues Under the Sea." 

You get to be Nemo traveling the world with your anti-imperialism agenda that has you attacking other countries ships.  Like the book and despite the combat, it's principally an exploration game although the designer has provided a number of ways to play it, then lets you pick your path: exploration, science, combat, anti-imperialism, adventure.   You might get zero points for a science discovery or ten depending on which path you chose to play the game. 

The event cards use excerpts from the novel. A charming little game. Need more plays before I rate it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
After one play, this is a pretty strong solitaire game with a good narrative and mechanics that only take a few turns to click. I scored 123 points--basically a draw--on a Science path.

It seems to offer enough choices, and more importantly meaningful choices, to keep things interesting. And with a few cards removed from the deck in each game, plus an expansion set of cards, there should be reasonable variety. And finally, with the multiple paths, or commitments, you can try different routes to victory.

Victory Point Games is quickly becoming my Hot Thing of the Moment, as I have recently added this, the expansion and Bulge 20 to my collection, with the Bulge 20 expansion, Dawn of the Zeds and Forlorn Hope on deck.

[microbadge=1714]

[u]16-May-2015[/u]:  This game is based on the novel, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. You play the role of Captain Nemo and command his vessel, The Nautilus, through the oceans of the world, fighting enemy ships, inciting anti-imperialism, and discovering treasures & wonders of the seas.

What makes this game unique is that there are four distinct paths Nemo may take, each with their own set of VP conditions. So depending on which way you go (and you don't have to decided until a certain point in the game is reached), Treasures may be worth more to you, or perhaps you are looking to sink as many enemy ships as possible, and so on.

There is a lot of dice rolling, which I normally don't tend to enjoy, but here, the narrative of the game really shines and overcomes this for me. Even when the dice aren't seemingly going your way, thematically it comes through with Nemo's struggles with his own mental state. There is quite a bit of a push-your-luck element as well. When rolling dice, most of the time, you may "gamble" one of your resources (the Crew, the Nautilus, or Nemo's psyche itself), to improve your odds. This, of course, could lead to a Tragic Loss if these resources fall too low, but it all adds to the theme and narrative flow of the game.

As far as components, this is the older style of VPG game production, so the counters are subpar, to be honest. But this doesn't detract from the game at all. The cards are serviceable quality with great flavor text from the novel. And I really like the map. It's a simple point-to-point movement between the oceans, but there is a ton of helpful information right there in front of you.

Overall, this is a great game experience.  With the four different paths to focus on and a great narrative flow, this is definitely a winner in my book. Well worth it, even with the second edition looming on the horizon.

Captain Nemo, the original Steam Punk!  This is a terrific, albeit underrated, solitaire game that deserves more attention - perhaps if VPG does a deluxe edition.

During the Initial set-up, you can choose Nemo's "motivation" for the game (science, exploration, anti-imperialism, or war) which determines how you play the game to score the VPs you need to win. 

The turn sequence starts with the Preparation Phase where you add additional ships or place treasures on the map and possibly draw an adventure card. Then it's the Nemo Action Phase where you can choose one of several possible actions: Rest, Repair, Refit, Incite, Search, Move, Stalk (ships), or Attack. After taking Nemo's action, you advance the turn (calendar) marker by 1 turn (Week). 

At the end of the game, you add up your VPs then discover how your story as Nemo ends by consulting the Epilogue Table and cross-index Nemo’s Motive (mentioned above) with the Victory Level that you have achieved.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Fantastic game. 

Pros: It just drips theme. The game tells a story and is no way pasted on. There are five different ways to play based on your goals that are set at the beginning (although this can change once at a certain point in the game) and your goal sets how the game is scored at the end. It plays in about 1 - 1.5 hours. 

Cons: Victory Point Games should be ashamed of themselves for releasing such a good game with such terrible components. I mean, the die cuts on the square chits didn't even match up on my copy. I had to trim the edges off of almost every chit in order to make them look somewhat presentable. $35 dollars for a shitty looking game that doesn't even come in a box. Shameful.

Still, I recommend it highly if you're looking for a fun, thematic, exciting solo game that plays in about an hour.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fun if somewhat dry solitaire game that cleverly distills the essence of Jules Verne's novel into streamlined game play. 

With the help of the game's designer, I worked through a few rules questions and quickly got a handle on play. 

"Nemo's War" plays very quickly, even though the game represents up to 52 weeks in time. A lot of thought and love for the book on which it's based obviously went into this game, as the story's characters and plot lines play out. 

My only caveat would be that, on a turn in which one does only one or two things, it seems like nothing much happens if one gets bad rolls. Even though I like it, I don't find myself playing it very often. Very difficult to win though, but that's as it should be. On the other hand, one has to play this enough times to figure out winning strategies, so some commitment to playing it creates its own rewards, which makes me appreciate the design all the more.

Purchased December 2009.

Fun Thematic and Original Solitaire Sandbox Board Game!! You are Captain Nemo aboard the Nautilus!! Feels like a pirate game with the sea battles, exploration, and treasures. Much replayability. One of the best designs by Chris Taylor, and offered by Victory Point Games. Bravo !! Lots of dice rolling. Lots of cardboard bits.

Fiddly rules (because of a lot happening), but fine once you get through the game once or twice. When learning, it's also helpful to watch the DriveThruReview video for this.

Oozing with theme. Many paths open to secure that elusive victory or be lost forever beneath the waves. I should have picked this game up long before now.

Game 1: Anti-Imperialism - Score 102 (Inconsequential)
Game 2: Exploration - Score 129 (Inconsequential)
Game 3: Exploration - Score 140 (Inconsequential)

Throw 4000 d6s and if you get 2000 sets of 10 or above, you win.

You don't win that often, in case you aren't good at math. And in case you aren't good at analogies, there's very little strategy. Thematically quite lovely but it needs more time in the oven and fewer dice.

Solo Player Value = Excellent.  This is wonderful all the way around.


Nemo's War is a fantastic solo game and offers great replayability. This is what solo gaming should be.

Nemo's War is a very interesting game as it encompasses many different mechanics and play-styles. Yet it remains simple to learn and play and does not get overly complicated.

Each turn the player acts as the game to reset the board and trigger any possible adventures to play through. Then the player is allowed one action of their choice to improve their standing. This is followed by the player following a pre-set order of actions that round out each turn. How the player reacts to these pre-est actions and what choices he makes change the game.

The design of Nemo's War is wonderful because it allows the player to choose which type of game to play and which type of victory condition to shoot for among the four available. This is a fun mechanic that makes the game different with each play. Trying to achieve victory with each victory condition is challenging, but fun.

Based on which type of game you choose to play, Nemo's War can change from being a game based on exploration and achievement to being an outright war game. This drastic change is easy and flows effortlessly within the game. What remains as the game changes is a wonderful time management mechanic.

It is important to note that Nemo's War is not manufactured by a major game producer. The game feels, and looks, like it is made in a small shop by the same people that designed the game. I absolutely love this feeling and look. The game is obviously made by people who care and do this for the love of the game. I can see how this look could irritate some gamers, but I think it is part of the games charm.

Some gamers might be put-off with the games cost. I think some might not like the somewhat high price for a game made in-house and lacks that professional look. I have no reservation paying the higher price for a game this attention detailed and wonderfully designed. I will gladly support the smaller game house and will continue to do so.

Pro -
- Well written rules that are easy to learn from 
- Fantastic design that allows the game to change based on player choices
- amazing replayability 
- Theme fots the game well
- Great "made in house" look and feeling

Cons -
- Some might not like the "made in house" look and feeling
- Some might be put-off by the higher price

Nemo's War is an excellent game which captures the feel of the novel very well.  As play progresses, one must balance several different items and make some tough trade offs. For instance at times, one has the choice to trade items which give victory points at the end of the game for immediate benefits.  All in all, it is a game of challenging decisions with high replayability.

I've rated this game a '4', but I grade hard ...Nemo's War is a unique game and I'm grateful that someone opted to design a game based upon Jules Verne's novel. I would happily purchase another game (on another novel) by the designer or another designer working for VPG.

Nemo's War is a solo game and works very well -- I don't think it could have been done any better in its selected format -- but it's a little dry, nonetheless. I wouldn't discourage anyone from buying it, I would just encourage realistic expectations of what it is -- an abstraction of a novel's narrative. You'll never be able to capture prose in a game and my rating reflects that unavoidable loss. I would rate it a better package than game, but I'm glad I got the game and I think any gamer would find enjoyment playing it.

Low quality components - cheap PnP type cards that typically come with the VPG ziplocks.  Sleeved cards -- a must with these games for better handling.

There are some lovely elements here, and it's a wonderful idea for a Solo game. Falls short, however. Nemo is one of my literary heroes, and I really wanted to love this game more than I did. I think that the main problem here is simply that it's more an "experience" than a game. As a player you have only very limited impact upon what is happening in the world around you. Events that occur (and sometimes it can be a frustrating few rounds before they do, if you're rolling poorly) feel scripted, in way that Ottoman Sunset, my other recent experience with the Victory Point Games solitaire games, does not.

Picked this up at Consimworld Expo. 
This is another excellent VPG solo game. I also have the Israeli Ind, Zulu, and now Nemo. This has great depth (get it?) and outstanding replayability.
Alan from VPG had replied to me saying that he would have some available at the con and that is the only reason I went. Then as Alan was bringing in the games for sale hit my chair with his hand truck. Destiny!

RATING: 4
A colorful and somewhat fun solo adventure game that has some depth. Strong theme is the highlight here.

Surprisingly, it didn't capture that replayable feeling for me as I felt the game overreached at times. Over-hyped, as it typical of VPG.

Ultimately, I found the game tedious - shelved.

I traded for this a long time ago.  Finally got a chance to play it.  It is a very creative and thematic design.  I was one point short of being successful in the exploration category.  I want to try out all of the other modes of play.  The designer did a great job of capturing the flavor of the book.

Another VPG excellent release.  I found my first game to be fairly tense and with interesting decisions to be made.  I can see good replayability.  Rules were straight-forward and I only had a couple of times to need reference the text.

It packs a lot of punch in a little package. The four possible "commitments" for Nemo encourage different approaches, which adds some replayability.  There are lots of clever ways that the story is delivered through the mechanics (i.e., the various modifiers) but I don't see the connection between some of the adventure card effects and their flavour text.  I do think the game swings a little too far towards luck on the skill-luck spectrum, which makes it all the more strange that I seem to suck at it.

I'm sorry!  Was I drooling?

This game looks so cool I'm salvating.  Must . . .make . . .it . . .through . . . end-of-semester-grading and buy it.

Move over "Zulus," looks like there's a new game in town.

My boys are freaks about the old Disney movie.  I have feeling they'd love to play this with me.

A wonderful solitaire game! The theme is magnificently integrated, and the ability to have a different goal every game (and to change your mind once during play), coupled with the variety of event cards, makes this a tense and difficult game, that nevertheless fascinates me every time!

Solitaire undersea choose your own adventure game as Captain Nemo. Paper and chits game. At start, pick a victory path. Liberation, incitement, and anti-imperialism tracks are quite unique. Event deck imbues theme.  Move the Nautilus around the oceans to sink capitalism and gain treasure.  I like how reinforcement groups of ships enter play as weeks pass and notoriety increases.  Dice modified event tests and combat and dice rolls for most actions.  Too dependent on luck of the dice for me.

Here we have an example of a poor implementation of an excellent game. Splitting the deck into two only makes the game drag on longer with a higher probability of having the game stall completely. There is not enough incentive to build early and thus you will see people hoarding and potentially exhausting the decks. Moreover, there are more tokens to spend before you can end the game.

Bel gioco.L'alternarsi di vagoni e velieri nella pesca delle carte dà al gioco molta varietà.Ovviamente (e come per tutti gli altri ttr) la componente aleatoria è sempre molto presente ed è difficilmente mitigabile.Bella l'introduzione dei porti che danno molti punti se vengono posizionati e punti negativi se rimangono fuori.La doppia mappa permette di fare diverse partite senza annoiarsi.In generale più difficile degli altri ttr con un tasso di sfida un po' più alto.Consigliato soprattutto ai fan della serie.Per tutti gli altri molto meglio ttr Europa.Ciao.

I was surprised how much my wife and I enjoyed this Ticket to Ride release. We bought it with high anticipation and before we played watched Dice Tower review of it. I was disappointed to see Tom Vasel not like this game. But when we played it, we loved it so much. We have played only Ticket to Ride, Ticket to Ride Europe, and Nordic Countries, but this one moved to the top of our list. The game is longer, but the tension was there the whole time. We played the World side with 5 people, and the Great Lakes side with just us two. Both were great but we prefer the World side and can't wait to play again. 9.5 for excellence. Not 10 because for how much money it is, the train and boat pieces did not seem as high of quality, but the more we play it the less I mind because I'm having a lot of fun. Probably would rate a little lower because of price, but we got it brand new for $50 instead of $80, so can't complain. Even with the 80 dollars I still would rate 8.5 because the game is great.

Nice variation of the T2R typical setup. If you don't balance the usage of trains and ships, the game creates a dynamics in which you might not be able to draw more objective tickets for you are only able to deploy one type of transportation or the other.

And that brings an Interesting twist on the traditional mechanics.

A hajók behozatala miatt sokan nem szeretik, de nekem nincs velük bajom. Sőt, kifejezetten jót tett a játék alapmotorjának ez a fajta ráncfelvarrás. Végre nem fukarkodtak, mert kétoldalas játéktáblát kapunk, és mindegyikhez picit különböző szabályokat. A tábla világtérképes oldalán pedig külön pirospontnak számít, hogy a játéktábla ellenkező oldalára is eljuthatunk a vagonjainkkal, így sokkal rugalmasabban tudjuk megtervezni az útvonalainkat. A kártyák sajnos nem sikerültek túl jól, a rajzok eléggé beleolvadnak a háttérbe. A kikötőket kicsit erőltetettnek érzem, de a játék végén sokat hoznak, vagy kompenzálják a befejezetlen útvonalaink miatt elhullajtott pontjaink számát.

Puts some complexity in the game and  the game becomes a struggle with cards. A red card can be a boat or a train, sometimes there are 2 boats on the card, so the administration has grown. But for the rest it is still Ticket to ride , but in my opinion too expensive. There are a lot of cheaper variations as Pensylvania and Africa which are good ticket to rides.

Played two player game. Got extremely lucky on my ticket route draws. Ended up comboing all three of my Harbours for a win of 327 to 151. Felt extremely unbalanced as a result.  I enjoy the added complication of managing your trains vs ships, but still prefer TTR: Europe for the best base game. 
Have played Rails and Sails 2, 3, and 4 player. Prefer 2 and 3 player games due to reduced length compared to 4 players. 
Honestly disappointed by the game, it seems to come down to getting lucky and getting tickets that combo with the harbours.

Remember Ticket to Ride? Well, though exploiting the same basic set of rules, Rails and Sails is no longer the gateway game the former used to be: it’s more of a gamers’ game now; that is, a bigger, longer game that might scare casual gamers as it involves a (slightly) deeper level of commitment and - most of all - a wider strategy.

Anyhow, Rails and Sails is a fine game of its own: the rewards for claiming routes and completing tickets are quite balanced with each other at last, which is decidedly an improvement over certain previous versions.
Nonetheless, even this iteration still has its drawbacks or it wouldn’t be Ticket to Ride: namely, the harbors and the shower of points they grant to their owners. 

Simply put, the harbors are game-changers: they grant as many as twenty(four) points or even more to their owner - which is the variance between running for victory and a placing in the rear - but are pretty difficult to build, since there are just so many anchored cards in the ship deck and, especially in the mid to late game, they run short quickly.

Knowing this might perhaps help players rethink their strategies for their next plays but this also shows why Rails and Sails can’t be regarded as a gateway game anymore. [i](November 2016)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - I would rate Rails and Sails as my favorite game in the Ticket to Ride series: sure, the base game is great when you need or wish for a simpler, quicker game but under any other circumstances Rails and Sails makes for the better choice, as there are just so many things you can do and you feel under the constant danger of either being cut off a key city you need or not having enough coaches/boats/turns left to do all you still need to.

Hence, in November 2017 I raised my rating from 8 to 9, the same as the base game.

I enjoyed this.  I think it adds a bit of decision to the game with the harbors, boats, etc.  What I did not care for, and this is the same for other TtR games, is if you do not balance out the tickets at least in the beginning, your game is hosed from the get go.  In my game, I did not get a starting ticket worth more than 10 where others had much bigger and better tickets.  Meh.  

Regardless, I love the Great Lakes map and would enjoy playing this again.

Really enjoyed this version of TTR, and I think it's probably my favorite now, though I've only played Eruope the once. I really like the addition of picking between boats or trains, and having to collect two different card types for either. Being able to replace the card market with EITHER type regardless of what you picked is interesting too, giving an option to try and hamper other players. The harbors are interesting as well, offering points if you manage to build them on your connected routes, but also a slight point loss for those left unbuilt. We played the Great Lakes map, which has most of the destinations in the lower left side of the map- in a 3 player game, one player ended up nearly completely blocked. Would like to try the other map to see if it's more balanced on destination spread! All in all, would be happy to play again!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It's very similar to playing 2 games of ticket to ride simultaneously on 2 separate boards, with wild cards drawn in 1 game able to be used in the other.  It takes twice as long as a normal game with roughly the same amount of fun.  Overall, this is a significant step backwards for the Ticket to Ride franchise, offering a longer, less compelling game that's just plain less fun.  I will not play again if I can avoid it.

Note that this is a single play impression on the world map.  The Great Lakes map might be more compelling.  If I am asked to play this again, I'll ask for that map.

I'll give it the same rating I give Ticket to Ride, as it really didn't do much of anything all that different from just plain old Ticket to Ride. It feels like a variant map with boats added, whereas I was hoping for a bit of a different game based on the TtR system.

In some ways, I felt like this iteration was almost worse, as there was a lot more fishing for cards in this version, where players were always looking for something specific, drawing blind cards until they finally got what they needed, especially when it came to building harbors, as they require rather specific and harder-to-find cards to build. I also felt the game overstayed its welcome a bit, and had a long play time for what was just TtR with some minor changes.

I also just didn't care for the harbors much. It's already a huge benefit to be lucky enough to draw tickets that have overlapping destinations. Now, you can get 30-40 extra points for building a harbor, in addition to the ease of fulfilling tickets with the same destinations, which seemed a bit odd.

As I write these comments, I've talked myself into rating it a tick lower than plain old TtR, and some of the nice expansion maps that have been made for it. It's still good, and I'd play it if someone wanted, but I'd rather play TtR on one of the many excellent maps that have been made.

I was looking for something less complex to play, but still had a little bit of something to enjoy.  I picked this over the UK map, and I think I should have picked the other.  That being said this is a fantastic variant on TtR, and it was really enjoyed by everyone, even though it takes quite a bit of time to play.  Everyone seemed to go for their harbours, and the Tours are to be avoided.  Super high scoring game, and it is hard when you can't mark when you've passed the 100's where you are really at...  This would still be my second choice behind Marklin.  Great game.

Longer and more complex than the base game. Having to guess the numbers of trains or ships to put aside at the start, manage two types of cards with and without port symbols and place ports makes planning much more important. There is a lot of luck in this version. If you are lucky enough to draw two or three ticket cards with the same harbour (rather than inland city) you'll probably do pretty well.

I really like this TTR version. It's like the old game but reinvented and more demanding. It takes a lot to manage all the different things like two color decks and the anchor cards and the destination tickets matching harbours and the ratio of boats and trains. In order to score high everything has to click and many times it doesn't. When everything does click it's a very rewarding feeling.

My only whine is that the game is almost like a completely new TTR-game and it doesn't match the old games. I hope that this game sells well and there will be new map expansions specifically made for Rails & Sails. Say Mediterranean for example. Since there are less colors in R & S decks, that is why the older maps don't really work for R & S- rules. I tried UK map which has lots of ferries but the deck had no blue or orange colors! It would be fun to play a whole tournament of many boards with just the R & S- mechanism.

Standard Ticket to Ride is so absolutely bland that I had no interest in going out of my way to try any of the other versions. However a friend of mine had picked up this version and was dying to try it so I gave it a go, and I have to say I really liked this game - not my favorite but it was very fun with all of the additions rails and sails adds. It's still fast paced but theres a bit more to think about. Just enough to make it interesting. I could see playing this between heavier games for a breather. Very fun.

Just how much can you milk this? 
Is Moon out of original thought?

It's just the same old crap, like Pandemic?

$80 MSRP, really, seriously? All most a $100? I think I payed $35 for my Marklin copy and that is just about it's worth, this has cheaper, cheeser pieces parts.

Ah, an Asmodee controlled company, so high artificial  MSRP, with a fixed low max discount, forcing higher prices on a cherry picked high volume online retailers and thus the buyer, lower prices to local shops, basically if you are an online buyer, a higher priced payed, to force buyers to buy at MSRP from  local game shops, so Asmodee can have a club house to house their lifestyle card Magic crap like stuff. Maybe Asmodee should invest in opening their own local shops and shop thier monopolies like behavior? Google what publishers Asmodee controls.... maybe Congress should look into them? Is it the reasons FFG prices went up, higher? You now see their products are fewer, big volume online retailers? 

Asmodee is pricing a cardboard board game out of reach for a lot of people. just what tax bracket does this greedy company target their games? Are they just milking the US consumer?

There are better games at more sensible prices then from Asmodee. Like Days of Wonder, FGG and Outlook Games prices have risen, even on reprints. I guess you have to pay these expensive middle men? I rather take up expensive golf.

Rules are barely more complicated than the vanilla games, but the gameplay is much deeper. This is either good and bad depending on your playing groups.  Younger players can certainly play this one rule-wise, but managing the pros and cons of the different scoring options is not so easy. Still it is easy to get into the game.

There are  more interactions between the two types of cards (train/boat) , boats have cards that count as 2 boats whereas all wilds are in the train deck. Add in the way to build harbors which require 2 boats plus 2 trains. Only 6 suits of cards instead of 8.
 
There are many ways of scoring, which seem pretty balanced, tickets, harbors, long routes

Two different maps that play significantly differently. One wrapping around the edge which change the connections perceptions.

Both maps work well with 3 players too and are quite blocking.
Longer, especially the World map, 90 min for a 3 players game, 120 min for 5 players

Pretty good overall for experienced players, still it feels like "same old TtR"  (I'd rather like DoW to publish new games instead of expansions), and it is expensive.

A much larger, longer variant of Ticket To Ride, featuring split cards, routes and pieces between trains and ships.  Enjoyable for the first hour - then more of the same for the second hour.  For a simple route planning/drafting game, this felt a little too much.  Graphically challenged too - card design is way too busy, where vital information is too tiny, and the wraparound board is inconsistent and confusing indicating routes off map.

After a rash of bad reviews, I actually enjoyed this much more than expected.  The hand management between trains and ships is quite interesting.   The game is a little longer than regular TTR, especially to set up, and the decisions are little harder when drawing cards.   Building harbors is interesting also, as it can really wreck your hand, but also give you a lot of points.   

Some negatives:  the plastic bits are thin and cheap compared to other TTR games.   The map is huge and has a lot of dead space.   The double ships are IMPOSSIBLE to identify in your hand because the corners don't clearly call them out - that's almost unforgivable.

RATING: 5
Played at GenCon, full game.  It bogged down in mid/late game with people hunting for long routes and/or harbors.  Harbors are worth way too many points to not sift for them, but getting the cards you need is a nightmare.  Definitely outstayed its welcome, and felt like having two or three routes early on with the same city in the start/end was hugely swinging for the points (because of the harbors).

I'm not a superfan of TTR anyway, but this one far outstayed its welcome.

Here is another wonderful version of TTR, still one of my all time favourite games. Here we have boats and trains and the decisions are ramped up as you need separate ship cards alongside the train cards. Throw in high scoring harbours and there is a lot more to this than base TTR. Played with five, as TTR should be to get the most tension out of it, the game is wonderful. With the extra decision space that the boats throw into the mix you are really on your toes throughout.

Rails & Sails manages to keep true to the Ticket to Ride model, while also deviating enough to make it more interesting. The sheer variation of cards (train, boat, double boat, wild, port card, etc) give players a lot of usage options, while not being so overwhelming or complex to change the game's target audience. There a few more elements to satiate the core gaming crowd, but this is definitely still in the gateway wheelhouse. My main gripes with the original game may have not been addressed, but its definitely a step in the right direction.

RATING: N/A
Ticket to Ride: Rails & Sails takes the familiar gameplay of Ticket to Ride and expands it across the globe — which means that you'll be moving across water, of course, and that's where the sails come in.

As in other Ticket to Ride games, in Ticket to Ride: Rails & Sails players start with tickets in hand that show two cities, and over the course of the game they try to collect colored cards, then claim routes on the game board with their colored train and ship tokens, scoring points while doing so. When any player has six or fewer tokens in their supply, each player takes two more turns, then the game ends. At that point, if they've created a continuous path between the two cities on a ticket, then they score the points on that ticket; if not, then they lose points instead.

Ticket to Ride: Rails & Sails puts a few twists on the TtR formula, starting with split card decks of trains and ships (with all of the wild cards going in the train deck). Three cards of each type are revealed at the start of the game, and when you draw cards, you replace them with a card from whichever deck you like. (Shuffle the card types separately to form new decks when needed.)

Similarly, players choose their own mix of train and ship tokens at the start of the game. To claim a train route (rectangular spaces), you must play train cards (or wilds) and cover those spaces with train tokens, and to claim a ship route (oval spaces), you must play ship cards (or wilds) and cover those spaces with ship tokens. Ship cards depict one or two ships on them, and when you play a double-ship card, you can cover one or two ship spaces. You can take an action during play to swap train tokens for ships (or vice versa), and you lose one point for each token you swap.

Some tickets show tour routes with multiple cities instead of simply two cities. If you build a network that matches the tour exactly, you score more points than if you simply include all of those cities in your network.

Each player also starts the game with three harbors. If you have built a route to a port city, you can take an action during the game to place a harbor in that city (with a limit of one harbor per port). To place the harbor, you must discard two train cards and two ship cards of the same color, all of which must bear the harbor symbol (an anchor). At the end of the game, you lose four points for each harbor not placed, and you gain 10-40 points for each placed harbor depending on how many of your completed tickets show that port city.

Ticket to Ride: Rails & Sails includes a double-sided game board, with one side showing the world and the other side showing the Great Lakes of North America. Players start with a differing number of cards and tokens depending on which side they play, and each side has a few differences in gameplay.

Part of Ticket to Ride series.

I love love love ticket to ride, but honestly I am not sure how I feel about this version.
The little boats are nice and I do like the double boat cards and the strategy that can come from which deck to refill the river of cards from, but the harbours are very difficult to get into play, cost you victory points if you fail to place them and hugely swing the point scoring at the end of the game.

I like the addition of an action to allow you to swap trains for boats or visa versa, and the board is pretty (world maps side) however the routes which fall of one end of the world and rejoin on the other side of the board, are actually pretty confusing especially when 4-5 ship spaces are on one end of the board and another 1-2 are on the other... so it is a route of 5-7 length but looks much smaller at first glance.

Excellent upgrade to TTR!  There's a lot more to think about in this game.

A refreshing take on the TTR series. The harbours add additional ways to score points and both maps play very differently from each other.

Having boats as well as trains (with the player deciding how many of each to take) allows for some strategic freedom.

Only downside I've encountered is that your hand is too big to hold all the train & boat cards. Would have preferred if they figured out a way to make 1 card deal with both rather than 2 sets of cards.

Recommended for those that love TTR.

This is "bigger" Ticket To Ride. The points will be bigger, the individual routes will are longer--is this better? 

A big hang-up is how you need a lot of precise cards to do things. Two ships, two trains, same colors, all with anchor symbols to build your harbor. What they really should say is you actually need one or two wilds instead, because you're never going to get such a pair into your hand--everyone else is hoarding those cards because they're looking for the magical pair as well. You drop off the top of the deck hoping for that magical wild or that green ship pair that never appears, and you think "well if it's something I don't need now, I can use it later?" NO! Totally not. You might never need those black and yellow ship cards you keep drawing so they are just going to clog up  your hand (or you'll need 3 more yellow or black ships to make them playable even though they don't help your routes anyway), while someone else needs those cards but will never see them. Gah.

First play was 5 players, World Map. We ran the ship deck out of cards so we knew "oh this time in the ship deck shuffle there are only 8 cards and they are yellow and red," which was quite a gloom and annoyance to me who needed green (and probably to others who needed the other missing colors). Maybe this issue would pop up not as badly with less players?

My low rating understates the game's quality in a vacuum. It's a fine variation on TTR. But it's a relatively complicated TTR map for new players, while having the price tag of a big box game. I'd rather own basic TTR for new players, with a few extra maps to spice it up.

But if you REALLY like TTR and want more variation, it's a nice expansion.

This review is only for the main Rails and Sails... haven't played Great Lakes yet:

Overall it just seems a bit too complex and convoluted.  It really is an exhausting game to play, and doesn't seem to gain a lot compared to many of the TtR expansions (or in some ways, even the basic game).  I don't know about others, but my family, who thrive and enjoy the other games quite a bit just struggle to manage it all.  Often a four hour game with 4 people.  And the harbors seem just a distraction and a bigger luck component, as someone who draws good overlapping routes already has a big advantage and can now just trounce the others.  Whereas the routes are so varied that many times more people need a place with few routes than is available (Mexico, Mediterranean area, and SE Asia seem to be the typical bottlenecks).  The Tour Tickets seem mostly like a thrown in complication, with so few in the set, and many so simple... a few more high point ones with zigzag tracks would add a real dynamic to the game (as they can at times be the cause of unexpected bottlenecks).  But as they stand, they're more just an afterthought that occasionally you get and most don't have real impact in the game.
The game does seem a little more varied in early plays... sometimes with ship cards becoming scarce, other times train ones.  That may make the game a little more fun, adapting to that... though certainly will frustrate some players too.  All in all, seems like a game more for the Ticket to Ride experts than the casual games... but also with annoying quirkiness that may turn off many hardcore gamers too.

Thinking the Great Lakes version may be a little more interesting and balanced, without some of the distracting complications (Tour Tickets, pair tracks, and more balanced rail/sail routes).  We shall see :-)

Excellent version of Ticket to Ride.  The world map has a serious weakness on the Northern routes.  As a result certain tickets are best given an increased value or they'll always be avoided.  Easily adaptable with small rule changes to give new experiences.

Ticket to Ride all grown up. This version adds welcome layers of complexity and strategy to the original game. Hand management and board position play a greater role here, especially with the inclusion of the harbors. The tradeoff of these extras is that it isn't as elegant or quick as the original game, but Rails & Sails is worth the additional time.

Ticket To Ride variant with some spaces marked for boats and some for trains -- and the need to establish ports. There are two maps: the world, and the Great Lakes. As someone who lives in a city on the Great Lakes map, that's my preference, but the game plays the same on both sides.

PLUS: a nice new twist to the game
MINUS: you choose the balance of trains/boats at the beginning of the game but it's not stressed as much in the manual so you may end up with too many in play

RATING: 6
So yes, it is Ticket to Ride, just a 20-30 minutes longer and with two different kind of vehicles (trains & boats), which means also two different kind of card decks. Couple of other rule changes or new rules too which means a bit more to learn, but those are easy to get into it. Different kind of card decks means that every player are having more cards in hand which slows a game play: "how many yellow cards I have and how many of those are actually train cards, not boats etc". Map is also bigger than before and things are a bit more unclear because of link connection between east and west side. Overall: TtR Rails & Sails is an ok new game to the series of TtR, but new things bring longer playtime and slows gameplay too which why I think this isn't going to be a big hit - or even a keeper to me. If you want a bit gamers game version of Ticket to Ride, I would choose 'TtR: Märklin' before this.

My first board game ever was Ticket to Ride Europe and I love(d) it!!! Been such an addict to the series, that I'm trying to have them all. But now that I have Rails and Sails - I have to enthusiastically admit that it downgrades all the other maps. Rails and Sails is by far the best of all version (in my opinion) as you need to strategize even more. Loads of points to win in all different kind of ways. I really hope there will be some expansion maps with this standalone.

Headache inducing and not in the good brain burning way. The two decks are hard to differentiate once in hand, the anchor symbols are tough to see, and the wrap around map is a bit much.  Harbors cause big point swings, though I suppose they aren't supposed to be easy to build. Our five player game took 2+ hours. All in all, vanilla TTR is the way to go.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This is the longest and most complicated Ticket to Ride game to date, as you are juggling train and boat cards, some with anchor symbols, some without. So it requires a lot more attention to what you have and what you don't. There are two draw piles and whenever you choose a card from the display, you also choose which draw pile to replace the card with.

I enjoyed myself, but I can understand that not everyone will, as it is a much bigger endeavor than its fellow games.

TTR with boats? Yea it's a little weird but it kinda works. Its not the best version of ticket to ride but its fun add adds a good amount of depth to a lighter game. I do favor the world map over the Great Lakes but that's just preference. I do like that things are shipping with double sided boards now, this just adds value. The components are standard TTR fair and the game is still just as easy to teach. I enjoy this version very much but i still prefer the standard TTR, such as Europe USA 10th anniversary or even Pennsylvania.

I was hesitant to buy the Ticket to Ride games, because.... trains... Not that trains are bad, but only trains?...  What about other methods of transportation?  I get it - the game is called ticket to ride and it's trains, but something just didn't connect with me.  

I played the original versions of Ticket to Ride and was still feeling the same way.

Then I happened to play Rails and Sails at a Convention (Core-Con in Fargo, ND) a few weekends ago and VERY-MUCH like this version.

The game is challenging, yet relies on a lot of chance.....  Almost too much chance.... however, not too much, so in my opinion the addition of the boats and the harbors and the Tour (advanced ticket cards) is just what this title needed for me to want to spend $50 - $70 and buy it myself....

I'll play this one anytime my friends or family want to set it up!

I played the Great Lakes map.  I liked how the routes seemed competitive.  It was interesting splitting between both rails and sails.  The harbor scoring was interesting.

The train/boats allotment was fiddly and not great for newer players, despite the rule.  Keeping track of both card draws is strategic, but also fiddly.  It seemed too much for any new to casual TTR fans.

I was a little scared off at first by all of the negative/neutral reviews. However, I picked it up when I found it at a good deal since my wife is a big TTR fan. I was pleasantly surprised. I thought it played very well and enjoyed the major addition (boats and boat cards). I do see the complaints that most people had, but it was really not a big issue. The routes that wrap the board on the world map can be confusing since some of them have boat spots on both sides and others have all of the spots on just one. The cards were hard to distinguish in the market between boats/trains and since you replace from either deck, they change position frequently. I suggest making two rows and keep the 6 cards separated by type. Lastly, with extra sets to collects (trains, boats, and cards for harbors) your hand size can get quite large and possibly hard to keep organized. Deal with it :)

I love TtR USA map but I was hesitant to buy this, and the only reason I did was because I got it new for around $30.  Generally I do not like expansions, I always revert back to and like base games the way they are - maybe because I like "simple."

The first 20 minutes of playing R&S I was already thinking about how it was going into the next math trade.  But by the time I drew my second set of destination tickets I started to get hooked.  This game is really fun, and I almost think I like it better than the base game!  The harbors really put additional strategy into the game.  I do like the simplicity of knowing where all the cities are on the US map, but this game felt deeper but not extra complicated.  However, you do need a large table and we used TV trays as side tables for our cards.  If you try and play this with just holding cards in your hand, well, you will be really frustrated.

I love the boat pieces, and yes, the train pieces do seem a little cheaper than in the base game, but not enough to make it a big deal.  

I surprised myself on how much I enjoyed this game.  I will want to play this over the US map every time!  My only complaint is the score track on the Great Lakes map.

1 play world map, 4er

This is definitely the most gamer-y version of the game that I've played so far. The main changes: 
- new ticket type -- touring: shows several cities in sequence; if you hit all those cities in that order, score big; if out of order, score less; if you miss any, lose a bunch (between "big" and "less")
- 2 kinds of travel cards: trains (which include the wilds) and boats (60% of which count as 2!).
- the card display starts with 3 trains and 3 ships, but when you draw a card you choose from which deck to replenish the display (when cards flush due to 3 face up wilds, restore 3 trains/3 ship display from the start of game)
- new route type -- pairs (gray): each train requires a matching PAIR of cards, although the pairs may be of different colors!
- new action option -- place a harbor: spend 2 train cards and 2 ship cards, all the same color and all showing the harbor symbol, to place one of your 3 harbors in a city to which you have a route connection. At end of game, unplaced harbors score -4. Played harbors score 20/30/40 VP (World Map; Great Lakes score 10 less) for having 1/2/3+ Destination tickets naming that city location
- new action option -- exchange tokens: at the start of the game, you choose how many trains/ships you want, to a total of 60. As an action, you may exchange tokens with those removed from game, paying 1 VP per exchange

Those harbors are really difficult to build! Maybe a little too difficult? I can imagine that, in a game with more players, it would be REALLY difficult getting 4 matching harbor cards in hand at the same time! Still, with four, this was a fun game!

I preorder this game and after seeing all the negative reviews I was a little worried.  While this is not my favorite way to play TTR I still enjoy it.  The biggest disappointment for me are the components.  The trains are very thin plastic and the card stock is flimsy.  Days of Wonder really tried to save some money with these lesser components and it shows.  For the price these should have at least been the same quality as regular TTR.

When I recently played the classic [thing=9209][/thing] again I was pleasantly surprised by how well it has held up over time. I've always wanted to play every version of this game, but I have not been very successful at that.
This version sounded interesting, so it was on the top of the list of TtR games to try for me. I quite enjoyed it, but I was also a bit frustrated. I can see why you are required before playing to decide how many trains and how many boats you want, but it also leads to unnecessary issues later in the game. When you start the game you have no idea what routes the other players will use, so you can't know what detours using what mode of transport you will need. This makes the game a bit clunkier than the original. Also, I felt that the harbors were a bit tacked on as an after thought. They didn't feel well integrated into the design and also where a cause of frustration. In the second half of the game I focused on placing them, but I just couldn't get hold of any cards with anchors on them. They never where available in the display and I never drew them from the deck. So it was dumb bad luck that caused me to be unable to play 2 out of 3 harbors.
So I like this version quite a bit, but it does add some aspects that could have been cleaner. As clean as the original would have been nice.

Initial rating: 7.5/10
BGG scale: 7/10

The added complexity from the two modes of travel kills the elegance of the game and any joy I usually derive from it.  Not a fan.

The world - rating 5 

Disadvantages: -it is still an easy game, but it`s not so comfortable to play, because you must concentrete to split the train cards from the ship cards. The same thing is on the map. You not only have to see what colours you need, but also if you have train routes or ship routes. I don`t feel, that the game is more difficult, you don`t have more decissions, but the game is harder to handling.
- in our game (4 players) there were very fast no train cards to draw. 2 players have hold this cards. This cards are so huge, because there are only few train cards, but you need tchem to build a harbour. The carbours are critical, because every gives you at least 24 points. So you really need to build all 3 harbours. So I think, that everything would be ok, if there were the same numer of train cards and ship cards. 
The joker cards are critical, because you can use tchem for building a harbour.
- The game is longer, but for an easy family game a longer playing time is an disadvantage
- The new and of game conditio - you have 2 more turns and not 1. It gives you more time at the end of the game, what makes the game more easy

Advantage: + Big difference comparing to the standard version
+ Tickets with multiple cities are interesting


The Great Lakes - BGG Rating 7
When you see the rules it seems, to be just the same like the World board, but the are some differences, that makes this side of the board much better
-you have a little bit fewer trains and ships what makes the game faster
-the harbours give you 10/20/30 points instead of 20/30/40. It`s still important to biuld harbours, but not so crucial like on the world map. You could try to do sth else.
-at the beginning of the game you have only 2 ship cards instead of 7. It`s harder to make the ships run out

I am a little worried that it may go on too long for a Ticket to Ride game overall I liked the experience but the game took about 3 hours, it was the first play though so hopefully faster next time.

This is an interesting addition to the Ticket to Ride series. I think the fact your pieces are split between trains and ships combined with the new draw pile mechanism forces you to plan ahead more than other games in the Ticket to Ride series. I think there are some problems with the World map but I really like the Great Lakes map which is a plus because I live close to the lakes. I like other Ticket to Ride games better but this is a solid game.

The biggest TTR yet, spanning the entire globe, and with separate rail and sail decks. Possibly our favourite, even over Africa, but needs a few plays to get a sense for it. Picked up by accident after playing at Spiel 2016.

Christmas gift from wife & child. YAY!  Contrary to what I've read elsewhere, prefer the world map over the Great Lakes.  Also like this better than Europe (I find the use of the train stations makes completing routes almost too easy).  Harbours are almost too powerful.

For the Ticket to Ride enthusiast, this really is the definitive version. I love both sides of the board equally.

RATING: 7
World Map can be a little too nasty, and with my family we never use the default card replacement rules, instead opting for 3 from each deck.
Great Lakes map is very good though.

A little too much game for a TTR, with both the trains & ships, and the harbors.

RATING: 6.5
Good game, same feeling compared to the base game with more complexity and choices.
But, you need more than two hands to store your train cards, boat cards, objectives cards, joket cards, anchor cards...
Components are as nice as usual, but the board take more place thatn standard ones and you need a large table to receive this game.

Easily the most frustrating of the series. Having to keep track of 6 colors in each of boats and trains plus whether they have anchors or not can lead to a lot of excessive drawing.

RATING: 7
It's Ticket to Ride but more so: bigger board, longer routes, more to think about. That's all more than the series really needs, so I don't need to own it, but I'm happy to play this occasionally when offered. There are several ways to score big, so final totals are likely to be a lot higher than in other TtR games.

After three initial plays, I'm not yet ready to offer an official rating. It's quite enjoyable, and the ships + trains adds a new and interesting take. But as some others have noted, I'm just not sure about the harbors. Building harbors will add A LOT of points for players who have tickets that contains a city they've built a harbor on. Is it too many points? Is it well balanced? I'm just not sure yet, so I don't want to offer a rating.

That said, for those who know Ticket to Ride well, Rails & Sails can still be learned pretty quickly. And while it may take longer than another TTR Map, it's still a very enjoyable experience, especially with friends who may not get to play it often.

I'll be frank, I haven't actually played the game. But the 2 separate piles prevents me from wanting to even try the game. Doubling the available variance in the cardpool is straight up worse then playing vanilla Ticket to Ride. And I can totally see where the increase gametime is coming from. Second thing that seems way too swingy are the harbors. If you are lucky to have a nice consistent set of cards: tickets going to/from the same harbor is a huge point swing. This has always been a thing for Ticket to Ride, but this edition just makes it far worse. Sorry, but this is a 'Critical miss' for me.

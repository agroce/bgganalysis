An interesting theme in this game. At least I am not that familiar with the history of Viking invasions on the British isles. I liked the card driven command mechanic and resolving battles with dice. It has been tested and proven in commands&colours game series (e.g. Memoir ’44 and BattleLore) and works here as well. Cards limit what you can do while the dice make sure that battles are not deterministic which makes epic comebacks possible (although improbable).

However, the biggest issue I had with the game was that both players command two different fractions and that the order of play for each fraction is determined at random. It is basically possible for one player to have four turns in a row which has potential for deciding the game. Moreover, the cards had some really really powerful “take that” events that also have the potential for deciding the game for good. Ok, the players have to be aware of the existence those events and not leave themselves too vulnerable, but still I’d rather make these events to involve some kind of die roll or something in order to make them less deterministic. It would mean that you can push your luck instead of being forced to play in a fixed way in every game.

Other minor issues I had with the game were related to details in the design, for example the Fyrd dice had the same flee icon on them as the other dice, but it’s effect on Fyrd troops is different. A separate icon would have been in place to avoid confusion. Moreover, for gaming purposes the map was a bit hard to read since the regions had all possible shapes and some of them had “tenctacles” extending quite far. So we had some surprise moments when an army moved over great distances with just one movement point since we missed that some region actually had a narrow neck of land between other regions.

In the end, I found this to be quite close to the Commands&Colours series but taking longer to play and having certain annoying qualities to it.

A few annoying aspects to the system in this game, but overall it's a fun, engaging, colourful game with a lot of movement and back-and-forth, evoking the period, and as it's a light game one overlooking the aspects which don't seem at all historical. Probably only really a 7/10 but I like the theme and the production values that nudges it up a point as I'm likely to suggest it and try to get it played. Glad I kickstarted it.

RATING: 5
After my first and only play. I didn't really like it as much as hoped for. The theme is everything for me here. The game it self felt dull a bit boring and I was mostly confused over game rules. But in all justice and fairness I have only played one game and with out the expansion. The biggest issue I have is the both sides are divided in to two. Should have been a 2 player game with just Vikings and Englishmen. I will give it a try soon again. 

And for some reason I just can't understand is why blue and green color is used when they could have swooped out one of them to any other more distinguish color. Sometimes it's hard to tell them apart so why make it harder it has to be?.

Really beautiful looking game, and I like the history behind it as well.  Unfortunately there are a host of problems.  The rules are a mess, almost unplayable at the moment until Academy puts up some errata and clarifications.  The game is super swingy, more so than any of the other games in the series, and I have played most of them.  The minis are also not very attractive, and far too small in my opinion.  Disappointed for now, but could improve.

Asymmetric games are great but they need an inner mechanism that balances the different factions somehow: and 878 Vikings completely lacks it.

The supposed Viking firepower when attacking is almost useless - if not utterly non-existent - against the defending English players, who can deploy lots of peasants to soak damage while at the same time doing as much damage as the Vikings (they roll up to eight dice against five, and only two of these can are slightly better at doing damage): at the same time, the English players have a lot of useful tricks, such as endless reinforcements almost on the spot whereas the Viking numbes keep dwindling the more they pursue their goal, that is, push for conquest.

I enjoy the concept overall but I really can’t say 878 is a game I wish to play again.
Still, it comes with beautifully small minis.

RATING: 9
This was a fun and light war game. 
I Enjoy'd it even a loss as the English. But only by treaty and on the 9th spot.
The viking players lost their hero in the beginning beacause some greed and bad rolls. But overall a fun game for 2-4 players. 
I would refer it as a much more fun and tacktic Risk for a nongamer.

Three games so far, all of which have felt reasonably well balanced and true to history though the English have won every time. The 'Feared Fyrd' make attacking towns with only a few raiders risky. This is like a cross between Britannia and 1775 but more asymmetrical than the latter. My favourite in this series because of the theme.

Another great addition to the "1812 series" of games. This one adds wonderful asymmetry betweeen defenders and invaders. Also, the leader rules where an army headed by a leader can continue to plow through the enemy is an interesting twist. 

I still like 1775 best, but this is a close second, and our group is mixed in opinion. We happily own both and expect both will see continued play.

Poor history - Treaty of Wedmore was with the Kingdom Of Wessex. There was no England at that time, and what we think of as England was divided into 7 kingdoms called the heptarchy:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heptarchy

At best at the time of the game (878) you might be called king of kings, or Bretwalda, but not King Of England.

The first king of all England, according to the BBC, was:

http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/athelstan.shtml

but he only ruled "England" for 3 years before it broke up. 

In 959 Edgar became King Of England and had the first actual coronation of a King Of England in Bath. He reigned until his death in 974.

There is a big difference in colours between the base game, the expansion and the BGG promo cards.

The KS left a bit of a sour taste in the mouth in terms of the game being available at retail considerably earlier (and somewhat cheaper) than I received my copy in the UK and the lack of contrition from Academy over this - their 'it's not our fault, it was Essen it was the fulfilment company', 'making games is hard', was a bit s&!t - they simply had to delay the distribution into retail.

Anyway with that being said, and a resolve never to KS another Academy game again,  I have eventually got to play it and the game itself is pretty good - easy to play, scope for a variety of strategies, and entertaining (if dicey) combat system and some very nice art. Looking forward to playing it again and to exploring the expansions. 

There were a few negatives - 

- It really needs a player aid detailing the event cards in each factions deck - a couple of the cards are quite big hitters so can be quite swingy so the players need to know about them (e.g. Ceolwulf).
- There were a few too many rules niggles/questions for a game of this complexity - i.e. not very complex.
- The map looks OK but is a little underwhelming in terms of the 'shires' - what went in to determining their boundaries? It may reflect historic shire boundaries but I suspect not and functionally why are some shires bigger than others thereby allowing faster movt - or is it just arbitrary?
- Concerned that moving last on the final turn is a bit of a big deal.
- Expansion box unnecessarily big.

RATING: 10
Wonderful port of the system to a Britannia/History of the World direction, with waves of Vikings hitting the English coastline, and rolling towards cities.  The familiar, clean rules, with the addition of reinforcement cities for the English, and leaders for the Vikings.  Early days, and lots of expansions to plug in, but this could well become my favourite in the series.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The title is self explanatory of what you are about to play. You get the map of England on a nice mounted board, plenty of soldier miniatures for all players/factions and event cards which add enough to the game aesthetics and make you eager to setup and start play. The rules are straightforward but still leave a couple of question marks on some battle/movement actions. Try to download the FAQ found in the BGG site. This is a wargame on a strategic level trying to occupy shires and towns. The winner can be decided after 5 game turns or more based on territory control. The Viking player raids the coast lines of England and tries step by step to occupy and solidify his territorial gains. The English player tries to oppose what looks like inevitable and throw the invader back to the sea. The Viking lands with huge armies every turn disheartening his foe. The English player gets recruits and reinforcements in small quantities, on many shires, every turn; gathers them to form adequate armies in order to face the adversary. The battles are fought with special colored dice for each faction, showing hits, flee or possible move out from the clash. Game mechanics are simple and after a few rounds you grasp how things flow and work. Game play is balanced and event/movement cards ensure replayability. The core game includes advanced rules and a couple of scenarios adding more flavor to the play. It is a fast paced and intriguing wargame.     
For more adventure, what-if situations and exploring variants try the 'Viking Age Expansion'.

Somewhat entertaining back and forth for a few hours. Then, on penultimate turn, Vikings played a card that removed my largest army (comprising over half my forces) and my only leader - Alfred the Great - from the board. Nothing I could do to counter, resulting in an auto-win for the Vikings where previously the situation had looked hopeless. Deeply unsatisfying.  Admittedly, one might learn of that card in future games and avoid placing large armies in the affected locations, but you could conceivably play a number of times without seeing it. Yuk.

played twice in demo. could be a very good game if the theme was orc/gobliins vs elf/dwarfs; as it is the factions are artificial and non historical (for example berserkers were not a faction and perhaps even never exist as we see them now). Too bad a good game is spoiled by a mediocre historical handling.

Disappointing. The components are of mixed quality - I could accept this for a wargame with a small print run, but a game like this funded by a very successful Kickstarter campaign should be much better. The tiny miniatures just don't work - even cubes would have been better. There is relatively little theme and most of it is in the art rather than the game play. I really can't understand why rivers - so important for the Vikings - are totally absent. As for the game play - it is so chance-based there is a feeling that the game plays you rather than the other way around. And it just doesn't work for 4 players. This seems like a 2-player game poorly adapted for four.

Originally due in August 2017.  Arrived in the last week of November 2017.

The kickstarter had disappointingly few proper updates once delivery was supposed to start.  There were misleading/unclear comments by company about where games were and intentions for delivery.  I am left with the opinion that the company chose to make the European and other deliveries wait so they could hit the target date in the USA.

There is also problems with components - cards with clearly misprinted backs so they can be told apart, which the company are choosing not to fix.

The game's probably a 5/10 if I was to rate it on game play alone.

I won't be buying from Academy Games again.

878 Vikings is a great, accessible 2-Player war game with clever mechanical improvements over similar weight games like Risk or Axis and Allies. This might not work well as a sandbox game — we had the most fun following the historic campaign. Within that constraint, the battles were tense and the tactics interesting!

The game seems balanced (this is a good point).
I haven't tried the expansion yet, maybe I'll raise my note to 6.5 or 7
Important point, the rules SUCKS, no F.A.Q and many points are uncleared. I had to search on the forum. 
The 3,4 players aren't good, but at least as a game owner you can play if you are 3 with 2 not expirimented players. Don't play 4 it's completly boring. I did once ...

Fairly simple war game of area control using movement cards and dice for battles. The theme is fun, the miniatures, dice, and artwork are all nice and good quality, as expected from Academy Games.

Simple wargaing (like Memoir 44), dudes on the map with dice luck. Great map and miniatures, I love the historical context, therefore, this review is a little biased.
Mechanics are good, not the best, luck does play a big role with your card movements and instances...my games have all come down to the last turn/dice rolls. Pretty exciting and tense.

This game has a couple a glaring issues.
1- playing the english is UNBELIEVABLY BORING. Viking is fun you get to attack alot and think about different things. As the english you play defense and just amass troops on respawn areas. 

2- game basically revolves around protecting and pillaging resouce towns. Thats it ..  the rest of the board is meaningless.

Initial rating based on a solo game.  I'll see how it stacks up against other games in the series after a few face-to-face games.  I am impressed so far.  The Leader Phase is a different twist in the system with the leaders able to have their armies move and attack before regular movement and combat.  The English are hard pressed and would most likely lose if it weren't for the militia (Fyrd) being raised before battles in town spaces.

It's here and it looks fantastic (no surprise there), but it seems to fairly cry out for a FAQ from AG. There seems to be a lot more ambiguity to the rules than I am used to from them.
------
Well, they've done it again. They've taken the base game system ("Birth of..."), tweaked it a little more this time, given us a new map and cards, and you have a whole new game. One that plays quite differently from the others, as it should considering the difference in time period. I really like them all, but I can see this one becoming my favorite. I haven't even opened the expansions box, but I'm really liking this one a lot so far (rules questions notwithstanding).  Too early to determine how well balanced it is, but it has a really good feel, especially since I replaced those godawful 'minis' with cubes.

878: Vikings is a more advanced light war game than previous entries by Academy Games into this genre (1812, 1775 etc...). It includes an entirely new Leader mechanic that significantly changes how the game plays but can also be slightly confusing for new players. The added miniatures takes the visual aspect of this above and beyond their older games. Overall, this is recommended to anyone into light war games and Vikings. The best Viking themed game you can get.

Pros:
* A historically based game that is fun to play.
* Beautiful looking game board and artwork.
* Great theme.
* Customize-able starting deck.
* Miniatures look fantastic.
* Stream lined dice combat system.

Cons:
* Command decisions are rendered almost useless.
* No easy way for the Viking leaders to retreat.
* Some rules are fiddly and required clarification (e.g. Viking reinforcements).
* You can run out of units too easily and that hurts later Leader invasions.

9/2017 After a couple more plays, I'm changing my mind.  This game has its niche with some of the people I play with.  It's simple enough that it can easily be played while drinking alcohol.  It's theme is also very prominent throughout and historical, which seems to be a huge draw for a couple of my friends.  Retracing the historical route the Vikings took through England is a very viable strategy (though definitely not required, or my favorite way to attack), which is really cool with a historically themed game.

10/2017 - Update.  This game has actually become a staple in my group, especially if we only 2 to 3 players on a given night.  Almost every game comes down to the last two turns; it's quite the nail biter.  I'm going to bump to a 10 because it's a great experience and I highly recommend to almost any board gamer.

Current stats are pretty balanced for the two sides in the game, we play mostly with the expansion with the churches.

Builds on the system from earlier games to provide an even better game experience. Successive waves of invaders, and counterattacks by the English, make for a seesaw struggle. As with earlier games, the cards and dice for each faction give 878 asymmetry of play. Leaders, with their ability to break rules and carry out blitz campaigns, give the game welcome depth. Great fun for a dudes-on-the-map game that can be played in two hours. Looking forward to adding the expansion options.

Got a chance to play this at GenCon this year (2017). IMHO this scratches the classic battle strategy game with a nice tie into history. The fact that the Vikings have a chance to overwhelm up to the fifth round is stressful because Europe (as history has told us) is in bad need of a unifying king. I'll not spoil it beyond  that. If you're a classic war strategy game player give this one a try if you get the chance. It just might stop the itching.

[2 play] Invaders lost both of our plays of 878 as we switched sides. Nothing conclusive there yet, but little doubt that the Vikings have a challenge ahead. I think I place this 3rd or 4th favorite in the series. although it has a nice element with the leaders, I am just more interested in the historical period of the North American implementations offered by 1754, 1775, and maybe 1812.

Gameplay is a solid 7, bad rating of 1 because Academy Games dodges responsibility for badly produced game components: Some copies of this game have badly colored card backs (washed out and too much red ink) making them look very cheap and stand out from expansion set and promo cards. Academy Games refuses to provide any replacement or the possibility to acquire new set of cards. Even though the card back issue seems to be wide spread problem they say that's not their fault and that they can't do anything about it. Don't buy from this company if you expect any costumer service, you risk being stuck with misproduced components.

878: Vikings can feel a little too chancy at times, but then again that's how it does such a great job of capturing the thrills of winning an improbable victory.

I thought the combat and troop movement in this game were quite strong. It was very humorous when, for example, my English units vastly outnumbered the Viking units in a shire, yet three of them decided to run away. I'm still getting used to the optimal strategy for the English side, but I would be happy to continue exploring that.

I liked the theme, components ranged from great to meh; the cardstock could have been a bit better (sleeve it ASAP) and the tiny minis lacked detail and it was VERY easy to get weapons bent. However, the trays and such to hold them was a great touch as well as the card holders and the map looks very nice.

Gameplay: It was fun, everyone on the table enjoyed it and it took around 2 hours with 4 new players. However, I felt it was too swingy. So many 50-50 odds of success and failure that made this area control game just too luck based for my taste. Player turns were random ,combat was very random with 10 englishmen fleeing from 1 viking, the number of vikings per round is random and in our game, 25 vikings round 1 really hurt. Also, my treaty card was 2nd from the bottom of the my deck, if it was the very bottom I could have lost due to extending the game 1 round.


Despite my criticisms, I enjoyed it enough to play it the next time a friend brings it!

Light fun, but Vikings seems swingier than [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamefamily/23301/birth-america-series]its cousins[/url], and one event card is massively OP - meaning it can instantly destroy a massive army.  Being on the receiving end is devastating and a bit sour, but if you're aware of the card's existence its effect can be minimized.

Too early to tell if this is "the one to own" in the series. I'm leaning towards no, but I'll keep an open mind.  [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/233859/878-vikings-invasions-england-viking-age-expansion]Expansion flavors[/url] range from hot 'n spicy to broken.

RATING: 7.5
I have played a few times now. It is weighted in favor of the Vikings. I have played the English more than the Vikings and have yet to win as the English albeit it was close a couple of times. I have not played with the expansions yet, although I do own them.

The Viking and English strategies seem predictable. The Viking's goal is to split the English, cut off reinforcement locations, and drive south (or invade from the south). The English play to hold on until Alfred shows up. Mounting a northern strategy for the English is difficult. There are few reinforcement locations in the north. The English goal is attrition if they can hang on. The Viking's goal is to run through the center and the south and capture reinforcement locations. When the time is ripe separate some troops from a Viking leader and capture the north.

The desire to maintain the historical nature of the time may limit the game's replay-ability. Owing to the fact that the English faction's strength is in the south, the English are forced defend those locations so that they can eventually mount a counter to the Vikings. There is no variation in the set up because of the way the map and the reinforcement locations are designed. Thus, by keeping to the historical nature of the period and the map design, the game's variability is limited. 

Some consider playing the English as being not much fun. There is some truth to that. The Vikings have multiple leaders with armies that come out each turn. They  rampage English defenses. The English only get one leader and that is not until turn five. Attacking with English armies is costly. Even when you think you have an army big enough to take on the Vikings - you do not. The English losses are too great. Even if you win, the English losses leave them spread out and vulnerable to a new Viking horde that comes in during the next turn. It is better for the English build up their army blob and wait for the Vikings to come to them where they have the benefit of the Fyrd for soaking off losses (there is one English card that provides the Fyrd militia for an English attacks, but that  card can easily be countered by the Vikings shield wall which negates one hit on all battle rolls during a turn). If possible, the English can try to pick off a location where they have dropped off units to control a reinforcement city.

Watch out for some cards like the Coewolf (Viking) or Religious Conversion (English) cards. They can be surprising upsets although the Religious Conversion is not that great as long as the Vikings have three units in one location and possess adjacent provinces to make command decisions to retreat into. It seems that the Viking's cards are more powerful and/or are sufficient enough to counter any  English cards and the fact that the English are already forced into a defensive strategy because their reinforcements are limited an spread out.  This tips the scale in favor of the Vikings. In other words, the Vikings are able to recover from the surprise cards better than the English, because of their concentrated numbers and because it is likely they have as equally powerful cards to counter any English card. 

After several plays, the Coewolf is  a broken card. The English have to know it exists or it can cost the English the game. On one of my first outings in this game, I survived to Alfred's arrival, and built up a large army underneath him, only to have it totally eliminated because of the Coewolf card. The Vikings controlled the south and east, but I successfully held on to the south west and brought Alfred in to take their center. The north was totally vulnerable and out of the Vikings leader's reach. This card ended the game. Until Coewolf is played it is impossible for the English to even think of countering in the center let alone doing anything in north where there are few reinforcements waiting.

I have now won as the English. The game came down to holding out until Alfred showed up. This time though, my opponent was not conservative and left his northern England/Scotland sectors un-garrisoned with only one man. This is mistake for any Viking player although leaving three Vikings behind drains the Viking player's leader. I played a conversion card which enabled me to bring Alfred in up in Scotland after I removed his one Viking. The Viking players (it was myself versus two), player their treaty cards and it was not turn five. They went consecutively leaving the last two turns for the English. As a result, I played my tow treaty cards and cleaned up the north. I brought down their level of control to eight and won the game.

Despite this victory, my points listed above remain the same. The English are purely defensive until Alfred. Attacking in force is foolhardy even with the Alfred's Gambit card. The best the English can do is pick away at the Viking's territorial acquisitions where they are vulnerable. As the English, building up  large armies in the south and hanging until Alfred is the key. It is not necessarily fun as the English because the first four turns are stacked against you. 

The designers of these games should consider a game in this system where the player has the ability to chose whether they want to play an offensive or defensive strategy and therefore customize their cards and deployment as such. This game forces the players into a strategy. This idea would be best with a modular board which would change the set up and strategy. One could do this using any type of theme using medieval, fantasy, black powder, or modern struggles.

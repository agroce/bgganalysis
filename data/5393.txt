Unlike Pit, you only need a majority of a resource, so a round can end too quickly. Similarly, shouting out more than just a number makes it hard to be heard (and even to think about what you want to do).

Knizia rescues another horrible game (Pit). He improved Stratego with LotR: the Confrontation...and he does it here.  Wheedle is by no means a great game, but at least it takes the Pit mechanic, repairs it, and makes it relatively interesting.  Thanks, Reiner!

There are some problems with this game.  It seems to work very well with four players.  However, with five or six players the game degenerated.  No trading went on and it just became a mad dash to grab the 5 or 7 card in the middle of the table.  I'll play it again with four, but I expected more from this game.

I actually quite like this one, and I'm surprised by the generally low rating. Sure, it's light, in the "fast and fun filler" class more than a serious game, but it's much more interesting than Pit. People generally overlook the value of doing uneven trades, which can help you (fewer cards makes it easier to go out, which is a lot of points). There are different ways to approach both the collection and trading aspects of the game. Good game.

Very much like pit. I played this with a mixed bunch of adults and kids and the kids just walked over the adults.

Good real time card game, where each player is bawling out shares offers in an attempt to create point scoring sets.  Neat catch where one share is left on the table, which indicates the bankrupt company when the dealing closes.  Fast and frenetic - works well.

It's Pit for gamers, and vastly more interesting than the old classic.  There are several ways one can approach trading in this game, and any of them can work depending on your hand, the group of players, and your ability to WHEEDLE!  The single card on the table is obviously very important, but don't get monomaniacal about it.  The players who are pulling off multiple player-to-player trades are the ones most likely to win the hand.

Also - and this is very important - you absolutely must stand while playing this game.

A great take on Pit‚Äîbetter, in fact, because of the variability in the suits. Because there the number of cards in the company suits varies, trades become more interesting. You do not need (or necessarily want) to trade the same number of cards, and in fact, the number you're bidding or asking provides a game theoretical signal to the other players. Great game.

RATING: 6
First played November 27th, 2007. Taught in <5min and played in ~45 min for 5 players. This has decent strategy/luck balance, however it has a bit of agility and reflex to it. All cards are passed around with one left in the middle.  Cards of different colors represent Nine stocks. Three 5's, four 7's and two 9's. Each number represents how many cards there are of each. The goal is to have a majority of each card in your hand. Once you achieve that, call "stop trading" and put your hand over the card in the center. To start a round, the dealer turns over the card and trading starts. To trade, you must put a card down and take the card before someone else does with the goal in mind to take matching cards and get rid of cards that you have singletons, etc. "Stop" trader gets 10 points and everyone gets victory points equal to the number of cards they have a majority in. So if you have 3 5's of the same color you have a majority. The card left in the center at "stop" is worthless and counts minus in people's hands. Each player deals once and the most victory points wins. It's a good simple game to play, however it could get a little competitive. I'd recommend giving it a try for those looking for a new game to play and interested.

This sounds like a souped up versioin of Pit and I'm sure its a game I can get my co-workers and family to play.  Knizia's answer to Pit and I already have Knizia's answer to Can't Stop, so it's worth a try.

Similar enough to Pit, but I do enjoy the changes.  The bankrupt company in the middle adds some excitement, and knowing what you're trading for makes each round much quicker.

More engaging than one would guess from a read through of the rules. In the same vein as Jungle Speed, there is a dexterity/reflexes component to the game which can't be ignored.

I've played a few Knizia games, and one thing seems similar about them: they don't really grab me.  There's nothing really wrong with them.  I enjoy them while I'm playing, but I never seem to suggest playing them, and I wouldn't be terribly sad if I never played them again.

In general I love Knizia's games and I think he usually makes the best in any given category.  In this case, though, it feels like he really missed the mark.  If it's group dependent, I haven't found the right group yet.  Everyone gets bored and frustrated right away.  I usually don't make a trade except for swaps with the center card...and I won last time!  It will probably be the last time for good.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
One of very few Knizia games I have played that I don't really like, probably because it's so open-ended. Unlike Pit, which the game resembles, trades take too long to figure out between players. The simplicity of just yelling out "TWO! TWO! TWO!" in Pit is replaced here with something like "I need two blue; I'll trade black, or purple, or green... oh, you want brown, how about two of them?" With the real-time race nature of the game, this kind of bogging down just doesn't work. Also, the scoring lacks the charm of most of Knizia's signature mechanisms.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
this is just a quick game of chaos without a good meaning.  All it is is you get a bunch of cards, then it is a free for all to trade for the matching ones.  A hand lasts for less then a minute and causes some players to be ignored in the ruckus.  terrible and pointless.

Set collecting game that depends heavily on simultaneous player interaction as traders of stocks on the trading floor. Yell out offers in order to obtain majority. When you think you have, stop the game and score. Not for my gaming table although a more animated group would enjoy it. I also don't care for the 4 player minimum.

RATING: 10
This is my #1 hidden gem in board gaming. Kind of like Pit, but with more room for innovative strategies and no problematic infinite-loop situations that ruined the original Pit. This game really does want 4 players minimum and doesn't really shine until 5 or 6, but it helps that basically anyone can not only play but truly enjoy it. In my experience, non-gamers love this one (the fact that rounds take 2-3 minutes and nobody ever has to wait their turn might have something to do with that).

I think I like this more than [b]Pit[/b]. The scoring seems more balanced, the bankruptcy aspect adds a nice element of potential spite, and the game seems to encourage more thoughtful trading than randomly passing cards trying to claim a monopoly.

Still, [b]Pit[/b] felt more chaotic, intense, silly, and can go up to 8 players (in the deluxe version, at least) so [b]Wheedle[/b] still won't replace the game, though I would grab it first in most circumstances.

[b]Edit:[/b] I take it back. [b]Wheedle[/b] has replaced [b]Pit[/b] for me unless I have 7 or 8 people... but then, I reach for something else usually.

One play with 6 players.  I reckon you'll need to have 5 or 6, but with the crowd in a fun mood this one will hit the spot.  Crazy and frantic.

Knizia does Pit.  That seems like a winning combination to me.  He adds just enough to the game to make it a little more interesting without making it to heavy or gamey.  All in all, a very pleasant experience.  [06/28/2009]

Pit works much better.  The center card adds too much randomness, but worse, it stifles the negotiations.

Somehow Knizia ruined Pit.

The card in the middle really messes things up.  Most of the game is just grabbing the single card draft. Who has time to make deals?

Often players keep drafting until a stasis is reached.  The Bankruptcy rule is irritating as it screws someone deeply.  It's quick, but even then it isn't worth the time.

Play Pit instead.

With four players it felt like I had too many cards to manage. The scoring rules leads me to believe that it's a good upgrade from Pit. I have to play with 5 or 6 players to have a better idea.

I like Pit.  Therefore, I like Wheedle even more.  It's live-time, but has a little bit more to it than Pit and is less chaotic, but just as frantic.

I'm not a fan of Pit style games, so my rating should be taken with a grain of salt.  I like seeing Knizia's take on classic games, so I appreciate the effort.  If you enjoy Pit, you'll probably like this game even more.

Quite an enjoyable game, but one where a skilled player can easily overwhelm the rest of the table, and the difference in skill required for this to happen seems to be very slight.  Still, there are more strategies available here than immediately meet the eye, and it has been fun taking a few games to discover them.  The game's main disadvantage:  It is really not as good as Pit.  The game's main advantage:  Many people who refuse to play Pit will play Wheedle.

[Out of the Box 2002 edition] {Party, stock; trading, real-time; optimal 5-6p} Knizia's take on the vintage Pit. Wheedle is as fun and hectic as Pit, but less chaotic. Players have more decisions in Wheedle in trading cards because scoring is included rather than collecting a set of cards.

For pure fun with larger group of players, Pit will be the better choice. But, if you want a meatier filler of the same genre, Wheedle is the one.

[Variant] The quick start variant is more preferable for experienced players.  For players new to Wheedle, the original rule is more preferable.

[House rule] per Tony's recommendation, negative scores are counted as 0 for new players so that Wheedle will not be too discouraging.

More interesting than Pit.  There are various ways to approach this one.  The names of the companies just kind of disappear and the colors are king.  Going out is important.  The card in the middle scoring negative is neat and adds something else to keep track of.  You need to be pretty aggressive with trading to win. 2010/07/07

This is Pit-medium. Has all the yelling and frantic play of Pit, with the added bonus of being able to score every round despite not being able to close the trading round. However, it can turn into a non-interactive game if everyone only trades with the table (open market), which can happen.

I like It's mine! better.  This is fun enough, though.  And I do better at it than I do at It's mine!.  This doesn't have as much thinking about the value of what you have as It's mine! does.  You pretty much see what you have the most of and try to get more of it.  Okay as a filler but my friends like it too much...

Everyone is so concentrated on the center of the table, that any direct trading between players becomes rare. Not Horrible, not great. It's upside is speedy play and simple rules.

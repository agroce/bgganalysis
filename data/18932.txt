One of the few games I couldn't be bothered to finish.  gameplay was extremely scripted because your available actions are very limited based on where you are on the track.  generic artwork lifted from an old tapestry combined with little or no text makes the cards incomprehensible.  Bad game.

Okay, first off this game has the poorest written rulebook I've ever been unfortunate enough to have to decipher. Having said that, said rulebook obscures a good, reasonably heavy game with many difficult decisions. Just get someone else to explain it to you.

RATING: 3
A beautiful mess.  Problems start with the confusingly written English rules.  Then there are the cards and board locations; literally fine art , but no icons or text to remind of their functions.  The game itself is quite an interesting one of development from peasant to merchant to banker, with key decisions around the timing of transitions. But what might have been an reasonable one hour game in the German style is stretched to more than twice that length.  All that matters at the end is influence, money counts for nothing. And the values of the randomly drawn artist and Senesi cards that give influence are so variable that it feels like you have invested 2-3 hours in a lottery.

I'played this game more than 10 times and I still like it very much. Each time I wonder what kind of strategy will give the best results, so the games still challenges me. Realize yourself that though it looks quite complicated, it works out well. The artwork is amazing!

One of the most balanced game I have played.  There is catch-the-leader mechanisms built in but yet the leaders still have a lot of freedom to continue to pursue victory.  My most recent game with 3 players took only 1 hour 40 minutes.

RATING: 9
A truly unique game. Very different to anything I have ever played before.
Has a very slow build up to a fascinating end game, which you almost need to start planning for in turn 1.
It "tells a story" in a very euro game-y sort of way and you do getting a feeling that you have worked up through the ranks of peasant, merchant and banker to achive your final status.
I definetly want to play this again.
VASTLY UNDERRATED!

Second game went a lot faster and was wildly different to the first four player game. Turn order is very important and knowing when to change your status is also paramount.

Looking forward to the next game.

Third game was another three player and had one player have the second highest amount of points but was not a banker so could not claim them. He was unable to get over the change to banker threshold.

The more I play this game the more I like it. It's quirky and a bit unusual but it still works and gives a great experience everytime.

RATING: 6.5
If you can get past the rules questions, this is a nice game that has the feeling of several games interlaced.  Play consists of moving through 3 stages of development.  There is a nice reward / risk for being the first / last to enter a phase.  Game play is quite simple (despite what the rules may make it sound like).  Biggest drawback is game play time - games tend to run long.  The board's artwork is beautiful, but it also shows the value of a good graphic artist to make 'meaningful / useful' art.  Learn the game from someone and enjoy. [GTI: TGSD]

RATING: 7
First game was with 5 players.  Being pre-warned I stocked up with player aids to assist with the interpretation of the rather ambiguous English rules.  An hour before the other players arrived was not enough time beforehand and we all spent a further hour attempting to understand the rules.  The game took four hours.  My opponents are not quick players, but the clever development of the game over the three phases - peasant, merchant, and banker - meant that the game did not drag, despite its length.  I was the first merchant and last banker, feeling some pressure to become a banker close to the end to preserve my chance of winning.

As a piece of craftsmanship - the creation of a game based on a painting - the execution is very well thought out and executed.  The game board and pieces are very 'clean' to preserve the aesthetic effect whereas I would have preferred more writing on the cards explaining their meaning or use (and likewise, some text on the board itself).  As a game I would be happy to play again, but felt that without the constraints imposed by the painting, the game could have become a little tighter in its mechanisms and timing, although I accept that further plays may address some of these concerns.  The game has a lot of self-balancing mechanisms and there was only eight points between first and last (the same value of the Ambrogio Lorenzetti card which came out as the last card).  The only obvious hiccup was the accumulation of six cubes in the inn before the first banker arrived, a big disincentive if you have no girlfriend of the courtesans, which delayed the arrival of the first banker.  Maybe a limit of three cubes in the inn would have helped.  Summary: plenty to think about, a worthwhile experience which may enjoy the occasional future outing.  I can well see why this game won the 'Best of Show' at Lucca 2005 with its strong Italian theme.

Good, if not awe inspiring, game of managing resources ( money ) with timing ( gathering max money ) in order to grab victory points. Three separate roles/phases for each player in the game do make for some interesting gameplay. Timing everything is the key. Small amount of screwage and take that are also evident.

Very interesting game which goes on too long.  Too much time is spent waiting for the right cards and for opportunities to pounce and sell the goods.  The allocation of consent/victory points through the senesi and artist cards is too random for this length of game.  The end game can also be too chaotic with a lack of control over your own destiny.

Absolutely beautiful production, looks gorgeous, can't wait to play.

Played:

This is a beautiful game that offers some absolutely new gameplay.  The idea of playing the game on the artwork is fantastic.  I like the different 'stages' the game goes through.  I could see this game improvng with more plays.  Once you are familiar with the rules, gameplay is quite fast.

Download the updated rules from the Z-Man website - www.zmangames.com - they are a big help.

Update:

Played with 2 and 3 players, our 3 player games last 2-4 hours, but it is a wonderful game experience, in many ways like three separate games in one, with each of the individual games interacting with the others.  I love the system of moving through the three game phases - Peasant, Merchant and Banker... and that when you choose to 'evolve' is up to you, but you need to time your run carefully...

A wonderful game experience.

A unique game that really needs to be experienced - the central conceit of using a renaissance painting as the gameboard, with almost no concession to normal conventions of board layout, sounds too pretentious to work but it does, and works well.

This is based on only one play, so bear that in mind. I actually thought the game had potential, but there is a huge showstopper: it takes a long time to play. Our game took 2.5+ hours, which really was not acceptable for a game that is light, thematic, and fairly chaotic. The endgame in the city, too, seemed to not quite work properly. Some fairly neat ideas, but several leagues short of an actual finished game.

It just doesn't really make sense.  The first half of the game is interesting, but flies by.  The second half is like playing a game totally unrelated to the first one and is counter-intuitive.  The idea of playing on a piece of art is really cool, but it was not well executed.

RATING: 6
Some great ideas, including the uniqueness of literally playing on a painting. The game itself is a race with lots of peculiarities and subsystems that lead to interesting player interaction and 3-4 different paths to victory. Beyond this initial surprise factor, and after a few exploratory plays, the game feels a bit underdeveloped and dragging way to long in its last stretch. There is also quite some luck that directly influences VP collection. Which is a pity, because there is some brilliance under the clunky exterior. Still, a unique gaming experience, so bumping up the game rating for this alone.

+ unique multi-stage race, which you can influence with your actions
+ auction and hoard cards mechanism, seems unique
+ jockeying for position
+ asymmetric plans
+ wonderful narrative arc
+ interesting strategic choices most of the time

= high player interaction
= quite a bit of luck involved, translates into probabilistic play
= the end can drag, if you become a banker with less money than needed

- original rules are a mess
- a bit difficult to teach since each card set and space does different things but none is annotated properly
- card stock is awful, sleeve!


I am keeping this one, as it is unique.

After all the mixed reviews, it's hard to know what to say.  First, we didn't find the rules difficult.  We read them through once, had some questions, read through a second time and felt secure enough to give it a try without first consulting BGG.  Second, the art works well.  If there is confusion about where to place produced goods, simply place them near to its Laborer/Wayfarer track.  Similarly, if the 2x5 grid of 10 in town spaces is confusing, move your disk along the labels on the outside of the grid, unless you visit the inn.  We found only two cards that didn't have text.  The Bricklayers card was easy to remember since it had an image of... bricklayers!  The Inn cards were easy to remember since they were the only other card that had an image without text - even if you couldn't recognize the portion of the Inn depicted.

Once you're past these, we found a economic game inside this medium Euro.  We expected it to snowball progressively but instead found that we were richest as Merchants and got progressively poorer as Bankers.  With only two players, a lot depended on paying attention to the cards the other was playing and managing your own money in relation to this.  Specifically, if it appeared that your opponent was preparing to auction an artista, spend less and hope your cash exceeds his.

While it feels that there are multiple strategies worth exploring, there are only a few ways to earn veeps.  Neither of us tried earning senesi cards through charitable merchant sales.  

Third play and it keeps getting better.  Easy set up, not too fiddly.

RATING: 3
A rather strange design. It got quite a beating because of the rulebook, but I don't particularly mind the English set of Z-man Games. It is a LOT, and you might need to read them two of three times, but the game itself is really not that difficult. Actually, it is somewhat fun, although once everyone is a banker, it does become repetitive and more of a modern day's version of the Game of Goose. What *is* difficult is the appalling quality of the cards, which have not been coated and stain each other like there is no tomorrow. They are quite flimsy, too. This seriously undermines the pleasure you might derive from the game, and tarnishes the game's already weak imago even more. I put them in sleeves when I learnt of the smudging, and that did help a little. Fortunately you do not need to shuffle the cards that often.

Eventually I sold this game off. Why? Because my sweetheart, who was so adamant in trying and buying it, found she didn't like it as much as she thought she would. Even when I suggested the game when in company of others, she pouted 'Noooo... Not Siena, but "X"'. Sometimes women, despite all their charms and interesting abilities, strike me as being creatures from a different planet. Game-technically, this game is worth a 5. But I've downgraded it to 4 because of the apalling production quality.

I sincerely disliked this game.  My rating probably reflected the fact that I really liked the art, but the game itself was, to me, a mish-mash of mechanisms that didn't work well together, and that weren't too fun on their own.  While there was some fun in the early part of the game, by the end it dragged out far too long.  It would take some serious arm twisting to get me to even consider trying it again.

The rules are terrible, in all 3 languages. The board and the cards are not very intuitive. Small pictograms and icons would have helped this tremendously.

The game itself is better than what all the bad reviews say. Medium-to-heavyweight Eurogame. There are some really interesting mechanics and concepts going on. I love the progression from peasant to merchant to banker. This game is very heavy on theme.

I am glad I played it. However, I agree with what Stephen said about it: "Why play this when there are 30 other, similar but better games out there (Le Havre, Agricola, Caylus, etc.)?"

Mr. Papini seems to design unique games that, to me, have that Martin Wallace feel to them. They are clearly based off a particular theme (in this case, fresco painting) first. Siena's novelty comes in the ability to create one's destiny. Each player begins the game as a peasant and works his way up to a merchant, and ultimately a banker. Players draft cards to conduct actions, trying to earn money first and foremost. Turn order is very important, and players have some control over the changing of turn order. Victory points are earned as a merchant by donating a portion of sales to charity. Bankers earn points by donating to charity, constructing a tower, buying famous paintings, and rank in final money position. 

Another unique part of the game is how the actual fresco painting is used as the art on the cards and, more impressive, the actual gameboard. The lack of icons makes learning the game a little more difficult (player aids would be very helpful here), but I respect the designer's decision to keep an unadulterated "fresco". It's almost as if Mr. Papini intended for the learning curve in order to force players to become more familiar with the artwork. Respect.

Not sure what to say about this one. We played once and I'm sure we got some rules wrong.  Too many arbitrary rules for a game that offered too few choices.  We spent half the game looking up cards and bank spaces.  At the end of the game the peasant was richer than all the bankers, next richest was the merchant (who became banker on the last turn).  If there was a game in this one, we weren't able to find it in our first try w/it.  It will be a tough sell to ever get this back on the table again.  So for now, this game is broken...aka a 1.

It's a good game, with some flaws, but far more pros.
The rule booklet needs better editing, and Siena cards tend to lose some particles of color from their back when repeatedly shuffled (transparent sleeves are needed if you think to play it intensively).
But, those apart, it's fun, and rather addictive: my friends and me keep talking about and playing it.
Note, anyway, that is a bit long for playing time: not a problem for us, but it can be a flaw for someone else.

From the clearly talented and eccentric mind of Mario Papini. Like his other game, De Vulgari Eloquentia you play roles which you can all get promoted to through the game. And you can only win if you reach the Banker role, so you are all heading in that direction. In de vulgari these different roles you take on are integrated into the game quite brilliantly, and I think that game as a marginally flawed masterpiece. In Siena the roles you play are played very separately, with the multi-use cards being the only shared space. I enjoyed the game and found it a lot better than its low rating on BGG would suggest.

It is a weird and wonderful Euro unlike anything else in the market 

[thing=18932][/thing] is from the same designer as [thing=75165][/thing] which is a true sprawling classic.  Like that game Siena is an oddity with game mechanics not really seen elsewhere.   [thing=75165][/thing] is the better game but Siena is worth exploring if you like auction-based Euros.  The game has three distinct phases to it and you move from one phase to the other when you choose to.  You cannot win until you reach the Banker phase but you can do that at the last minute if you choose to.   So the game is almost three distinct games with a lot of interaction within each phase, and with the auction providing the interaction for players in different phases.

If you enjoyed De Vulgari I would recommend searching this one out: its low rating on BGG really is not justified if you are open to this kind of game.  If you have not played De Vulgari I would recommend starting there if you want a left-field Euro unlike anything else yet massively compelling.

hmmm. Terrible value for the cost (retail).

There is ***NO WAY*** what  you get (1 map, a deck of small cards, 40 or so small cubes, some player disks, and a box) is worth the $50 retail. This game should sell for $20-25 maybe  $30 from a smaller publisher TOPS.

Game play has some interesting and unique choices; mainly when to transition into the different arenas of play, and then after that its mostly standard game mechanics. (auctions & card play, hand management)

With the published rules, it may play too quick and it looses some of the dynamic of when to switch roles, yet
with the designer's rules it outlasts its welcome.

I want to like this game (some unique elements and I like the concept of playing on the painting), but I want to hate this game too( I feel ripped off having paid retail). Unfortunately, I don't feel either. Its another average game at best.

If you can pick up a copy on the secondary market, value it at 3-5 plays.

You start as a peasant, become a merchant, and eventually a banker.  We all think the merchant phase is broken.  

All 4 of us became Merchants about the same time.  As soon as the last peasant becomes a merchant, all cubes (workers & goods) are removed from the board.  Selling goods is the primary way a merchant makes money.  So for the next 8 rounds plus, the only way we could make money was on the road.  The road cards are few and it took each player between 3 and 5 cards before they could advance.  Since the game end on the 20th round, half the game for one person, was just sitting on the road waiting for the right card to turn up. 

The Inn cards --another way to make money--were evenly distributed and no one could acquire 3, the needed amount before they could be cashed in for Florins.

The Peasant phase and the Banker Phase work well.  The Banker in the town is fun, but the rules accompanying cards, which are not self-explanatory, are quite lengthy.  

The first game took us 3 1/2 hrs.  Even though I had spend 3-4 hours reading the rules (which are poorly written)and searching BGG for clarifications, we still spent an hour and a half referring to the rule book.

The board is beautiful and outstanding.  The I like that the scoring is used 4 different ways.  

Fix the Merchant phase, and make the play of town cards easier and this game would be improved greatly.

RATING: 8
By eurogames standards, this one has a steeper learning curve than most, but Siena is definitely worth the effort.  There are several mechanics that blend well together.  For instance the evolving roles from peasant to merchant to banker each time with different goals and ressources makes for an interesting experience.  Money in this game is used not only through trade but also for status: the poorest goes first in purchasing new cards and also decides who will go first during the action round.  Very critical role and a wonderful catch up mechanism.  My two minor criticisms for this game would be game length, though having a longer game is nothing disastrous if it means more involvement and fun, and the map.  While it is gorgeous and significant effort was made to transform it into a play area, it takes some getting used to.  My one major gripe with the game is the card stock used; I know I will play this game again because there is much to explore here, but why the heck was such a weak cardboard used for cards which require much shuffling?!?

Classy game!  This is rich, sophisticated and the artistic 'non graphic designed' board adds to the class.  In a sense even the poor English translation of the rules adds a kind of 'exotic' class - but this last one has diminished the reputation of an otherwise very fine game.  Mind you the game may not have been play tested quite enough - there maybe needed a few rule tweaks here and there, but you'd have to play it at least 20+ times to be sure of these.

Bought at EQIII, Nov 2005. Two plays - really liked the first game but the second (a 2-player) didn't go as well. Long (2+ hours) but very interesting. Like 3 games in one. In Game 1, you're a Peasant, scratching out a living hoping to one day be a merchant; In Game 2, you're a Merchant, making long journeys and seek to build a modest income in spices and cloth; in Game 3, you become a Banker in the city of Siena where Courtesans and Calindrino roam the streets and frequent the Inn.
A most unusual game - you play it on an actual medieval painting! Brilliant! Downside - tough rules to follow and fiddly to begin with. Once you have it in your head, it's quiet simple to play.

Longish game with one of the most awful rulebook I have ever read. Teh game is not bad per se but without real choices. I don't like scoring rules, in particular the 4 points span given by money.
About the art: it seems there are two light spot of the fresco centers, and also the rest of the grafic is less than perfect.
Give it a try before invest any money

Horrifying rules to penetrate which lowers the rating. But the mechanics and game is very intriguing, although you need to play it at least once before you start to understand the game. Defintively not just a promotion game for the city of Siena, although I love the board painting, which is from the town hall of Siena. In the first game we made a couple of serious mistakes, but it felt better in the second game. Still 3 hours is too long for this game.

Prettiness and lack of info on the board, combined with lots of fiddly details makes the first play a bit difficult.

Played one game with five players, and I thought it was very interesting, very atmospheric and extraordinarily creative. It's also quite complicated and a bit on the long side for a game of its weight--there's a fair amount of luck and there are no brain-burning decisions to make--but I enjoyed the game so this didn't bother me overly. My one criticism is that the "Via Francigena" cards can end up being a pretty big deal if everything goes right, making it possible for one player to have a huge leg up in the first third of a rather long game. Anyway, I wouldn't mind trying it again but it's not something I'd want to play every week.

Awesome game with again, elements of daily life as it was way back when. Love it how it all got incorporated into the game and depicting actions of each society levels, peasant, merchant, banker. Very nicely done. You can really get a sense of what life was all about back then and how daily routing flowed.  Another one of my favorites.

Although there's a lot of things to remember while playing about what each card does, creating player aides helps immensely and makes the game more than enjoyable, it makes it worth while.

Siena is a really imaginative game, which takes economy based Euro, and blends it thoroughly with a renaissance Italian theme.

This is clearly a rhythm and strategy game, with some luck around the cards available, but more around optimization of hands, timing of actions, accumulation of funds, and using them to collect points.

I'm going to start this at 7 for now, but I think I will tend to value this more highly, rather than totally trashing it. (The general rating extremes seem more pronounced for this game.)

It's clearly built around a unique concept, and Mario Papini deserves more love than he gets. I suspect this may turn out to be a hidden treasure, like a Christwart Conrad game, rewarding continued play.

There are issues with this game.  Holy crap, is this over packaged (cut the size of the box in half and still have lots of extra room.  Card quality is horrifying (sleeves are required).  The rule book is mandatory to figure out what each stage of the game means (there are no useful player aids) and the rule book is not horribly clear.

All this said, oh my, what a mean little game.  Cut throat competition is highly aggressive from the beginning (you get your goods snatched out from under your nose, you'll want to kill that damn beggar, and the whores rob you blind).  The points scramble is wonderfully oppressive. Employs a strange mechanic of punishing the wealthiest player with higher costs and gives the poorest player the benefit of choosing who goes first.  Being rich isn't the great advantage you'd expect.

This game needs more play to see if it is as amazing as I think it is.

First game with 5 players (which was shortened because of lack of time). The rules are far from clear after an initial reading, but playing the game clarified most things. The lack of explanatory text or symbols on the board and cards was a hindrance at first, but is a small price to pay for such an aesthetically pleasing product. The game itself seems to hold a fair degree of promise - there are a number of nice mechanics, and some interesting strategic decisions to be made. My initial impression is that the scoring lacks elegance due to it having an element of luck (I'm not sure how much of an effect this will have on most games, but personally I would have preferred fixed scoring ie without the Senesi cards).

Length to Brain power ration = to Brass I think. I like the different phases and how you can use them to get ahead.

There are some interesting qualities to the game, but it is largely a mess.  Yes the complete lack of iconography on the cards and the general component design is a failure.  But, I might be able to overlook that.  The game itself has problems.  In our game we saw something like the Liberte problem, as we had denuded the deck of anything interesting, and all kept waiting for something to break.  Furthermore, while there are strategies, there aren't really tactics.  The decisions on any particular turn are relatively straightforward and not too engaging.  The initial auction is truly odd as you are auctioning on items that you will not utilize for many, many rounds.  While beautiful, I doubt I will play it again.

I haven't played it, BUT watched the game closely for 4 or 5 hours (yup, it's strange ;-) ) and have absolutely no desire to ever play it.  It's beautiful, it's fresh, it's innovative in many aspects, but the game mechanics is not coherent and does not contribute to making this game great (or even good).
Yep, the climate is there, but that's definitely not enough, especially in a game soooo long as this one.

RATING: 4
Very very unique and very well themed as well with lots of nice touches, even a house of the ladies thrown in, a beggar, the art on the board etc... so extra points for this, a gallant effort really as there really is lots of good ideas however it is much much too fiddly meaning far too many little rules and card abilities that bog the game down. 

I really liked the tempt fate cards which add a great push your luck element, flip from 1 to 6 cards hoping not to get the 1 devil card out of the 7 total, a good chance to increase your income but if  good old satan shows up you lose it all. I liked the auction and how turn order balanced out making things cost more for richer people and also having them go last, this added an effective catch-up mechanism. I also liked how the 3 levels of status were implemented and how each gave you different choices, this meant planning when to upgrade was important. 

For some reason the game progress's much slower than it should so it takes too long to get to that 3rd level of status where a pile more fiddly rules are added, interesting but just too much for this kind of game. Bad card stock, not user friendly as cards have to be looked up etc, VP's being random for a game of this length wasn't a good idea, in the end lots of good ideas and probably too many all put together making the game too bloated and long, had this been streamlined and rules lessened it could of really came out a good package. I don't remember who said it but this quote fully applies here, "A design is finished NOT when there isn't anything left to add BUT rather when there isn't anything left to take away.

RATING: 7
A game with a lot of really interesting ideas that's unfortunately a bit rough around the edges. I love that the board is just a portion of the fresco adorned with a few tracks around the edges. I also love the three distinct phases of the game and figuring out when is the right time to transition between them, both because they play radically differently, but also because they can play off of each other in really slick ways. Being the last peasant after everyone else has become a merchant can be very lucrative, so you might end up being the first banker, but it also means you're missing out on the merchant points, so it makes for a tough choice.

But I don't really like push your luck, which shows up admittedly pretty minimally. And the artist auctions are a bit weird since especially late you seem to just wait until you have the most money and can guarantee winning it in case you flip a high one. The fact that the value of the thing you're auctioning off is random is pretty odd, but it sort of works. There is some opportunity for bluffing, but not much. It also seemed like if you have the least money while everyone's a merchant you have a lot of control over being able to stay there and rack up the point cards, which is kind of dumb and kind of kills what should be an interesting part of the game. The auctions for cards also seem a bit odd, especially since most of these cards are for the third phase of the game and you're getting them in the first or second phase, so for a while you have all these dead cards clogging up your hand, then once you're a banker your hand size is almost irrelevant, and three of the ten banker spots quickly become dead spots.

Overall, a game I respect a lot but probably don't want to play all that often. But definitely a game I'm really happy to have in my collection. Arguably 7 is too high a rating for that, but there's just something very likable about it.

Blech.  Like eating burnt toast without butter.  I feel toward this game like most ATers feel about Euros in general.  Why did we spend 2.5 hours looking at the bits on this board?

This really plays like at least two different games.  It is tough to tell when to become a merchant and a banker.  It has hosage and a lot of interesting mechanics.  It does take too long to hit the table often and the last stage seemed to drag at times.  We first played the 20 round version and when it finished I wanted it to continue but knew it would have taken too long to hit the other game ending conditions.  Steep learning curve but worth it. update, this plays much faster when players are familiar with the game and 20 rounds isn't enough.

I'm not sure what to think of this game. I really like the concept but I'm not convinced that the game itself is great.

That said I'm willing to give the game a few more tries with a complete set of rules to see if it's worth keeping.

One play with 4:
The game is very good. The rules are bit of an ordeal, they are just a bit disjointed... but once you've worked through them the game runs pretty smoothly. 

We amazingly ended with scores of 49,50,51,52 a lot closer packed than I would have imagined. The timing in switching roles is a lot of fun to try and figure out. There is a lot to think about in the game and it offers a lot of player interaction. You are constantly wondering about other people since your decisions to advance to merchant and banker are very dependent on when others might do it. 

If I can get the play time down a bit in the future it might make it an 8.

Utterly confounding. Our sealed copy of the game came with 2 sets of rules that contradicted each other in multiple places, then we printed out a third set of rules that were even more contradictory. So we struggled through a game where our interpretations of what we could or could not do were marred by our having read three very different explanations of the rules. Some mechanics just seemed nonsensical (something like once you became a merchant you ceased to have the ability to sell certain goods, so if you had been gathering those goods up to that point then they were now useless to you for the rest of the game). Paid $5 for this and it was probably worth it for the experience of playing one of the worst games in my collection.

Impressive and original game. The idea to use a painting as the central element of a game has been very well developed. The game mechanism looks complicated when reading the rules, but the different turns play quite fast and the concepts are easy in practice. The best strategy is not that straightforward and has to take a lot of elements in account: decision when to evolve from farmer to merchant to banker, how much to pay during auctions for either siena or artist cards, which siena cards to buy and when, what to do in the town and when, ... Probably best with the strategic variant mentioned by the author. Note to self: don't buy too many banker siena cards early in the game. Second note to self: don't get too many of those senesi cards [i.e. become a banker rather sooner than later]; it is much more rewarding to walk around in the town and do stuff to get victory points like building levels of the tower!

For a game to be any good, it needs to be either fun or engaging. Siena is neither. It's too repetitive to be fun, and there aren't enough choices for it to be engaging. In spite of the fact that there are some interesting mechanics at work, it ends up being on of the longest and most boring games I've had the misfortune to play. Siena doesn't offer you any particularily meaningful choices to allow the game to stay fresh; It ends up playing more of itself than you ever will.

My first play of this game revealed it to be an excellent and unique "meaty Euro" game.

It is a bit on the long side but each turn feels quick and their is little downtime.  The rulebook could be better written but the complaints on this site exaggerate the problems somewhat.

2nd copy for trade

All games on my trade list are also for sale.

A much maligned game that I totally get into. 

When playing Caylus, I think of myself as an ambitious real estate developer...

When playing Siena, I think of myself as a social climber with all of the tenacity and necessary hard work, luck, and tenancity to move on up. You start out as a peaseant, climb your way to become a merchant, and then finally comes the pinnacle of social success and wealth... you become a banker strolling through the city, trying to avoid the pitfalls of the brothel and increase your reputation as a good wealthy citizen...

The rules are not well written, but once you figure out how the board works and what the cards do, the mechanics and flow of this game feel intuitive, with a strong sense of game progression. It is fascinating, immersice, and fast playing. 


Anyway, this is a beautiful game with beautful game components.

RATING: N/A
Very beautiful game with 2 distinct but fixable flaws.

Some love it, some hate it. There is little middle ground.

Funagain has for $10 BUT see the following by Tom Vasel:

Pros:
- Beautiful components/ board
- Some very interesting mechanics, such as turn order, and the different roles a player has during the game.
- The Fate card deck, with the devil card

Cons:
- Game isn't intuitive at all, cards have no text on them.
- Players may play for twenty minutes without making any meaningful decisions.
- Players have to play through a good part of one game to even understand what is going on.
- The game's fun ratio doesn't pan out to the amount of rules needed.

As you can see, the Cons outweigh the Pros, so I'm going to give this game a slight thumbs down. I will give the caveat that there are some experienced gamers who might think this one is worth a try. If you don't mind the unwieldy rule set, then by all means have at it. Early ratings by hardcore gamers are quite high, and I can see (vaguely, as through a dark glass) the cool features of the game. But light gamers, and people who want to quickly grasp a game should probably turn away. Siena is a beautiful game, but for me, it's one I'll admire at a distance.

See this review: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/170075/the-greatest-gaming-injustice-of-all-time

The game certainly has a great theme and the idea of playing is very inviting. However, given the poor rules and the unintuitiveness of play, it is unlikely to hold any no-gamer interested enough to actually learn how to play (let alone enjoy playing). Wait until I get it for free as a donation to the classroom library.

[Played twice]

Pro: 
-) the progression between three roles, each with different rules and options.

Cons: 
-) Victory Points are awarded in random amounts;
-) the "artistic" board (I prefer functionality);
-) the cards (you will need a reference sheet; the cards have no text and no symbols, nor even a simple 1/2/3 dots to remember which roles can play each card. They are made of poor quality paper);
-) the Fate deck (a push-your-luck element appearing at most four times in each game, but occasionally able to have a huge impact on the local economy);
-) the "modifiers" to buy cards, to artificially hamper the leader (besides they quickly become irrelevant as so much money is generated that they simply become something to be tracked);
-) the poorly written rulebook.

Overall:
It tries to be a strategic game, but the result is mix of ideas badly blended and too much affected by luck.

Beautiful artwork and great idea using a fresco as the game board. Alas, the two levels of play - the farms and the city - sadly play totally differently. Also, game flow would have been greatly enhanced by at least some iconography on the game components. This way, you flip through the terribly written rules all the time.

There are some very nice ideas here, and sadly the final steps towards developing homogenous gameplay weren't taken.

I was not going to get it, but then I saw it in Essen.  It was so beautiful, I jettisoned my ideas to purchase some other game, and snatched it.  Very interesting mechanisms, and a great progression from peasant to merchant to banker, with advanatges and disadvantages to each.  Looking forward to another play.

Played five players, and good fun although ran a bit long.  But I won, and beat JeroenD in the tiebreak!

Beautiful, strange game with a mish-mash of mechanisms & some interesting ideas.  A ton of quirky, unintuitive rules makes it difficult to grasp out of the gate.

Would love to try this again with experienced players to see how it turns out.  Need to play this again to see whether or not it has too much chaos for the time invested.

Very interesting marriage of theme and mechanics, but ultimately more trouble than it's worth.  I especially disliked the fact that the victory point cards have a range of 1-4 and you're drawing randomly;  this makes it possible for Player A to EARN more VPs than Player B, yet end up with a lower score.  I also wasn't thrilled that when you upgrade your rank (peasant to merchant, merchant to banker) you can no longer perform the more basic actions.  I understand why that's the case, but I would have preferred some other kind of catch-up mechanism.  On the bright side, the presence of hookers (oh, sorry, "courtesans") in the game creates all sorts of opportunities for juvenile remarks.

One of my biggest surprise for Essen 2005 (maybe because I heard bad feedback about it): you have to come over the rules (very confusing) but innovative and interesting mechanisms (especially the decision of becoming merchant then banker to avoid competition). Think it plays better at 3 or 4, and has evident pitfalls... but also "charm" :) It's nevertheless a bit too long and too messy at the end...

[EDIT]After 4 plays, I am still not convinced by the courtesans who are a big flaw in the rules imho amongst others... I am still hesitant to rate it 3 or 9: nice ideas but so much weird arrangement. Let's "cut the pear in the middle".

Il buon Mario Papini non offre mai giochi banali e Siena ne è il manifesto. Non esistono mezzi voti per questo articolato gioco, c'è chi lo boccia irrimediabilmente e chi lo esalta per l'esperienza che offre. Siena è un gioco sicuramente complesso in virtù di un regolamento mal scritto e di meccaniche che offrono molte opportunità; a rendere il tutto ancora più intricato sono le tre distinte fasi di gioco che propone. Tutti i giocatori infatti iniziano la loro avventura da contadini, nel corso del gioco avranno la possibilità di evolversi e diventare mercanti per poi completare il percorso di crescita all'interno di Siena diventando banchieri e cercando di entrare nel Consiglio dei Nove della città. Il gioco scorre liscio e avvincente nelle prime due fasi, abbastanza simili tra loro. Si articola e diventa più complesso nella fase dei banchieri quando ci si muove all'interno delle mura della città. Nel complesso Siena è un gioco molto orginale, a cominciare dal tabellone, che non è altro che un affresco di Ambrogio Lorenzetti, e le carte di gioco che sono degli estratti dell'opera stessa. Anche se per alcuni versi può ricordare altri giochi dello stesso Papini, come Casablanca e The Vulgari Eloquenza, Siena è ancor di più un gioco unico, geniale e avvincente, offre molte strategie e, una volta digerito il complesso regolamento, risulta divertente, strategico regalando anche una buona interazione. In 5 giocatori trovo sia perfetto anche se il gioco si allunga offrendo a volte fasi di tempo morto.

Original idea and a rather unique game. The rules aren't exactly easy to read, and nor the cards nor the board give real clues as to how the game works, so it is a rather difficult game to get the hang off.

This game has three phases.  You start as a peasant and gain dollars by finishing goods (3) and selling them at market.  Then as your wealth increases you can declare yourself merchant.  Merchant allows you to bring goods to market and purchase victory points (very key spend the dollars to look at the cards to achieve the most points).  Finally, with even more wealth you can declare yourself banker.  And bring cards to auction to be bid on for victory points and while banker build the tower for victory points.  To win you must be a banker with the most victory points.  The player with the most money gets two victory points.  So, don't save your money unless you need those points.  It was a fun game to play.

Beautiful board! Cards a little thin.

Good game of progressing from Peasant to Merchant & then Merchant to Banker in the town of Siena.
Contribute wisely to the town & be rewarded with Consent points.
Watch out for the beggar & the temptations of the 'Courtesans' (or just plain whores, as we call them!) who will relieve you of your money!

A little daunting at first glance but is actually quite an easy to grasp game, after an initial runthrough.

Rating based on one play.  The Good:  There is, somewhere buried in this game, a very interesting idea--that of struggle between classes:  peasants vs. merchants vs. bankers, even as each individual strives for upward mobility. Three intertwined games are being played simultaneously, and as you change classes, the game you play changes.  It makes for an interesting plot.  The board is beautiful, as you may have heard.  

The Bad:  The game is unplayable due to very stupid issues.  Three simple things would have greatly improved the game:  1.  streamlining out all the silly little rules (e.g., the beggar has an A effect on spot X, B effect on spot Y, etc), 2.  adding icons/information directly on the boards/cards (it seems very possible to do without touching the artwork at all), 3. putting some effort into the rulebook (this I take on faith, as I myself haven't read the rules.  I do know that our poor game owner had to wade through a few BGG documents to get the rules right).  These are not small issues--it took us an hour to get through the rules explanation, and even after that we were constantly having to recheck the rules, or being reminded that X was a special situation.  In addition, there are still clearly some niggling issues that playtesting ought to have uncovered--for example, an inn full of courtesans acts as a disincentive for anyone to become a banker first.  I believe these are fixable issues.

Our game took us 4 hours.  Part of this was due to all the rules questions.  However, I think it was also largely our own fault--we didn't limit the game to 25 turns (as suggested be done for beginners), and now that I've played it, I feel like we all made some fundamental mistakes that caused the game to drag.  The game, according to the box, can be played in an unbelievable 45 minutes--I think we may be able to bring it down to 90 minutes, which would be a fine length of time for a game of this weight.  

I look forward to a 2nd edition of the game that allows players to focus on improving their lot in life, rather than being mired in legal questions.

1st play with 2 players.
A lot of confusion reading the rules.
Absolute needing of a player aid...

After the second game.
I really liked the game.
Despite the confusion in the (very beautiful but not much usable) board the only problem is the distribution of points in the "Senesi" cards (victory points).
I would have preferred an alternate way of scoring points, based on tne number of cards rather that on the valor of the single card.

Attractive, original game about the class struggle in 14th century Siena. As in his other game to date, Feudo, Signor Papini has included the concept of a femme fatale within the theme. He crams in quite a few mechanisms: my first impression is that the whole is well-integrated, but further plays needed before giving a final rating. The rules are a little long and hard to remember at first: a cheat-sheet would be welcome.

This is the perfect example of how the enjoyment of a game can be influenced by how well it's taught to you. I played this with an excellent player aid sheet put together by a friend. The rules explanation was just right and because of this we all understood the rules really well from the get go. The rules are in no way complicated (maybe the rule book is), and neither is the board. (Regarding the board - I can't see any problem with it at all. It's both beautiful and functional. Initially it would be helpful if the card actions were written on the cards, but one card explanation sheet to pass around works fine.) It's a very nice game with an elegant mixture of auctions, placement, risk taking and valuation. Despite the frequent decision making required, it moves at a good pace, with not too many options to take each time it comes around to your turn. The first part of the game is about picking up some good cards and money for using in the current and later stages of the game. The seven card limit is an all important consideration here because there are some good cards to be picked up for cheap if you want to hold onto them until later in the game when they can be used. The middle merchant stage is about picking up some victory points and possibly the bulk of your money for the final banker stage. The tricky thing is deciding at what point you want to move from peasant to merchant to banker. Each role has their restrictions, advantages and disadvantages. To a large degree deciding to progress or not will depend on what cards you'll think you'll need, how much money you think you'll need and comparing all this to your opponents and assessing whether they can help you in boosting production, whether you can bypass the inn, and how they currently stand building the tower. Turn order is determined by wealth, and while it's important it's not critical - a little bit like in Power Grid. I do think the Senesi victory point cards are imbalanced - personally in a game so close I'd have thought values 1-2 would be better than 1-4, but it's a minor quibble and a debatable one at that (brought on by one player receiving seven points for his donation versus my three, just from the luck of the cards on an action each player will perform once during the game). I knock it down a point for the luck of the devil cards which can either make a player very rich through luck or have wasted a lot of their money through bad luck. One player might get rich and the other not - which can be a game breaker just through the drawing of these cards.

A tentative rating after 1 play.

Set in Medieval Siena, players are trying to climb through the social pecking order: Peasant > Merchant > Banker. Each stage has a unique method of gaining players money and bonuses. This is done towards earning Consent Points to win the game. The mechanics are driven by a series of card drafts/auctions. With these cards, players take actions (produce/sell goods, gamble, sabotage other players, etc).

The game's unique claim to fame: players play the game on an actual painting! In reality, this doesn't really work as the cards and board have alot of special abilities that require players to constantly refer to poorly laidout rules. The painting itself is a little too faded out on the board.

The game has alot happening at once. It's almost free form in the sense that players take actions driven by what cards they choose to acquire. Behind that sense of chaos is a very able middle weight eurogame. Lots of tense decisions to be made.

My advice: stick with the game. Download some of the player aids to help you along, familiarise yourself with the different cards and abilities and play it a few times!

Am I missing something?  First of all, please note that I've only played this once, but I'm rather confused about how the game felt.  

I felt that it was certainly pretty, rather daring, clever in concept, and thematically compelling.  But, I kept wondering if I was making any worthwhile decisions to further myself in the game.  

People complain about pasted on themes, is this the first pasted on game?

In some ways this reminded me of the dreaded Paris Paris, in that you chose the most obvious cards that are going to help you.  In many drafting games, it feels like there are different paths to take but here the choices felt entirely too clear. Especially after the first two cards are drafted.

Then the waiting begins, I can't tell you how many boring turns I played where I did nothing but pass, drafting cards and hanging out on the road. 

Also, there are too many catch the leader mechanics so that once you do well, it takes forever for an effective turn to come around again.

While the fresco is lovely to look at, and nice to play on in concept, it is almost completely superficial to the card play, although I guess you do run around the city in a circle.

There are many legitimate complaints about the game, obtuse rules, no helpful player aids, no icons, arbitrary art to associate play, the insignificance of money late in the game, obvious choices that come out randomly so you just wait for something worthwhile, the absurd initial penalty of the whorehouse, the single point increment bids that take forever, the random draws for points, and so on.  

But, none of those things get me as much as the fact that I had spent most of my game passing, made a couple major mistakes, wasted some more turns, paid way to much for an auction, and in general lost most interest in how I played, yet through no fault of my own I won.

I may give it another chance, but I'm sure glad I tried it before buying it.

I have played this game a few times now and ultimately....I do enjoy it. Sure, you have to had played it a couple of times to really get it especially the importance of the cards during the initial auction. But this game will always hold a place for me. My friend pointed out after the birth of my daughter in March that I had named her after a board game - Sienna. (Not true, I didn't realize until after he mentioned it) Maybe my next one will be Caylus?

Very thematic, and some interesting mechanics here.  I like the auctions and how you have three different roles throughout the game.

RATING: 3
Interesting game set in 14th century Siena, most notable for its representation of the social hierarchy. Players start as peasants, who draft/auction cards to produce and sell basic goods. A rich enough peasant can become a merchant, who can no longer use the same actions but can begin, by donating money, to acquire victory points. A rich enough merchant becomes a banker, who earns more money but is also required by status to spend more of it; bankers have many more opportunities for VP and, in any case, only a banker is allowed to win.

This is a light-ish exercise due to randomness in various card draws, but the structure is intriguing enough that it might be worthwhile if not for the unnecessary length and the issues with production.

Siena is poster-child for good art and appalling graphic design. The board shows a famous fresco by Ambrogio Lorenzetti known as "The Effects of Good Government", showing the city of Sienna and the surrounding countryside. There are locations and tracks marked around the edge of the board, but spaces are unlabelled; worse, cards required to perform various actions only show relevant sections of the fresco with no information about what they actually do. It's tolerable with player aids, but tolerable isn't good enough.

I'd love to see this social status mechanism used in a better game; it's not a good enough reason to play this one.

I'm being generous with this score since it's based on only one playing.  The rules in the box are very poorly written but the revised rules posted by Zman are much better.  The complete lack of iconography makes the game harder to learn than it should be.  There's a lot going on and almost nothing on the cards or board that makes it easy to grasp.  This is a relatively long game and struggling with the rules only makes it last even longer.  Also, in our playing we ran into an issue with the courtesans that we initially felt broke the game: there is no limit to how many can be placed in the inn and the way the game is structured almost ensures that there will be about 8-10 of them on the inn before anybody becomes a banker.  Because of this, players were reluctant to become a banker, which bogged the game down and made it very uninteresting.  After re-reading the rules, I now think that there is probably enough money (and VP) to be made as a banker that the courtesans shouldn't have been considered as much of a deterrent as we felt they were.  I'll try and play this one more time and see how I feel after that.  I'm hoping the score will go up.

The central graphics are much too dominant. To the brink of being disturbing to the gameplay. Spaces like the Inn in the main picture is a place you can place your pawn, but there is nothing to indicate it. Cards have no text to guide you to which card do what, which is a drawback for your first game or two. Income in the first two thirds of the game seem too random for my liking. At least for everyone but the poorest player.
I'm unlikely to play this again.

WCMF '08 prize table.  This game really suffers from terrible graphical design; there are many fiddly numbers that could be easily remembered if they were just printed somewhere on the board.  Interesting, but it drags out.

Despite the simple wooden cubes (typical for an euro-game) that are used to play the game, 'Siena' allows you to feel the atmosphere of the old Italian city, where people were working hard to advance from a humble peasant to a merchant or a banker that enjoyed significant influence in the town. First, you are trading in wines and clothes, then you become an important person soliciting for the support of Siena citizens by funding the artists, giving the donations for church and... avoiding beggars and courtesans. 

This game is the best with a group of old friends and a bottle of a good wine (or the opposite). Still, you need to be smart, to plan carefully how to spent your limited funds. But, I would recommend 'Siena' rather to people who like to immerse in a historical climate than to heavy-game players. 


Number of plays: 3-4.

Ridiculously overblown and fiddly game that presents as a full hour of impenetrable rules and card reading.  We struggled through and found a distinctly average game that revolves around timing decisions. Too tied to the city theme, in need of a developer's careful trimming. Interminable game end. It also takes a long time to play, and has that annoying 'feature' where you work away at something (in this case production) and someone else comes along at the finish and steals all your hard graft. I really LOVE that. :yuk:

As ever, YMMV, but there are far better games out there. Even Z-Man have better games.

I know it looks lovely, I know you want to love it, but it is not even close to finished. At least try before you buy.

Worthy but dull.

Mario strikes with a fascinating theme, but my first game was too long and difficult to learn, I think for badly written rules. No one symbol over the cards, necessary for understanding quickly card powers. Mmmmm... I hope in the future some change will take place in this interesting but not convincing game.

You`re startin as a peasants, than become a merchant and finally a banker. The first to roles are only a preparation to the real game as a banker. So it`s something like a setup where you have influence what cards you get to the third role.

Playing on the painting is nothing special. Normal fields would be better (more easy to see where you are).

Some exeptions from the rules. Easy to remember, but for the first game you should have a player aid.

It seems, that you don`t have so many choices.

I really like the board for this game.  It's beautiful, and despite others' complaints about playablity, I thought it was functional.  Timing things out to get the most advantage of the Peasant, Merchant, and Banker was interesting as well.  However, the courtesans piling up in the inn seems to do bad things to the game.  No one would want to become a banker, all the VPs from the Merchant phase run out, and two of the three ways to get VPs as a Banker are wrecked as well.  All of which leads to an unfulfilling game.  It also seems to run long for what you get out of it.

Updated (8->6): I still think the game is interesting and challenging but it's almost impossible to teach and it needs constant reference to the rules for all the little details. 

Very interesting game. Play different roles during the game and have to prepare to switch at the right time.

Very original and amusing wonderful game. I learned and played it with the author: it was an  cut-throat and unforeseeable competition in a 2-player game. Only drawback are the totally absence of text on the cards that help in the learning and low quality cards but they're minor problems. Playing on the Lorenzetti's picture is a wonderful hint. I think Siena is 3rd best all time game after Caylus and Funkenschlag. Must have. Great !

Well, maybe it's only a 7, but it sooo beautiful... Anyway, it's a good game. The choices between to be peasant, merchant or banker is hars, because if you are the first or the last one of them, it is very benefical for you. No clear strategies for me so far, either the hurrying or the waiting could be a winner one. Warning: I think the 45-90 minutes is a joke on the box. Well, maybe with two players - but hey, with 4-5 experienced players it would be at lest 90 minutes, I guess.

By the time we got to Siena, I was feeling pretty worn out. I hadn't slept well the night before (Chris' snoring is beyond belief!) and had skipped lunch by accident. This ended up being a much longer game than I had anticipated, running to about three hours before we ended up calling it... one of the players had to leave to teach a game. Anyway, about halfway through the game I started feeling my brain getting fried and by the time the game was over I wasn't in good shape.

So my thoughts about this game are tempered by the fact that I probably wasn't in a good state to give it it's fair due. And on top of that, this game has a weird timing to it. You start as a peasant and you're trying to make enough money to become a merchant, and then to become a banker. But once you progress to the next level, something you voluntarily do when you're above the money minimum, you can never go back. So you really need to know when you should advance to the next level. In particular, once you become a banker, you're going to be losing money really fast, as the only ways to get points as a banker require some spending and there is a mechanism for other players to cost bankers money. This was something that I didn't really get very well and it's a key concept to the game... much in the same way that turn order is a key concept for Power Grid.

Even though I was having trouble getting the game and playing it poorly, I still see the idea the game was shooting for and it's interesting. I think the game is a lot longer than it needs to be though, and I think the idea could be developed a little more. So overall, I want to like the game, but I don't think I quite can. Of course, if I wasn't sleep deprived and starving, maybe my opinion would have been more favorable.

Very interesting design. I'm alarmed that I almost passed on this game.

What's interesting is that the players have one of three occupations, "upgrading" as the game goes on. What each occupation does is quite different: Peasants and merchants produce and sell things, while bankers obtain a pawn and move around a circular board, focusing on VPs. There is a sense of an economy, and inter-occupation interaction, resulting from who (and how many people) are doing what. This would complicate an effort to devise a strategy that always works.

A few criticisms maybe. I think it's a little long. This may be necessitated by the randomness, which is related to my second issue: Especially the gambling elements (fato cards) don't seem profitable enough. Thirdly, once everyone's a banker, the card purchasing at the beginning of every turn becomes dull as they will mostly use cards for their movement value rather than their production. Fourthly, the latter issue doesn't seem like it has to be that way: There are a number of one-shot cards that only work in the banker phase, which once used are removed from the game. I'm not sure why the designer couldn't allow them to be recirculated.

Fifthly, the cards feel like sandpaper!

Both tries made me wonder why. Yes, the game fits the theme of the artwork the designer used for the game board. The final spin around the Banker track seems loaded with fixes to fit the theme. Getting ahead on the score track causes you to crash and burn with player order, and you seem to go back and forth as you hurl headlong towards victory or defeat. The game is way too long for its worth.

RATING: 5
Siena is a multifaceted, multi-roled game in which there's a real feeling of narrative.  The board is gorgeous, and the options dizzying.  This feels like an older euro, from before luck became a bad word.  Lots to think about and a theme which sets it head and shoulders above accounting exercises like St. Pete & Puerto Rico.

One drawback is the learning curve. But Siena feels like the kind of game that--if it were part of a small family collection--would get scores of repeated plays, feature tasty metagaming, and never get old.  In such a setting I could see it rating much higher than my once-played 6.

Update 2017:
Love it or hate it, Siena is unique. I tried playing it when I just got it. Three times. I think, but I'm not sure, that the third time was the way it's supposed to be played. And then it was moved to the huge pile of games that I like but won't play ever again because nobody else likes them. There's a difference between this and the other games on that stack: I am not willing to sell nor trade Siena. Because there will be a day on which visitors inspect my collection of games, point at Siena and ask me what strange game that is, and if they might play it.
I'll be their willing host and guide them through a career from peasant to banker, into the colourful and perilous city of Siena. An adventure they will cherish.

Despite the fuzzy rules and quite negative comments I heard, I really wanted to have this because it simply looks fabulous.
27/09/07: Finally played it, 2p. And it was quite fun. The distinction between the farmer/merchant and banker makes the game very interesting. Will play again soon.
03/10/07: Second play, 3p. Better! Next monday with 4.
08/10/07: third play, 4p. Not everyone liked it. I did.

And then it took some time... 20/02/14
4p once more and it was great. This is actually a good game, but you have to be lucky with the VP-cards.

Once you get used to what the cards do, this is a fairly simple game to play, but with a lot of room for differing strategic decisions. An oft-overlooked gem, there doesn't seem to be another game quite like it. The painting that functions as the board is absolutely gorgeous, though I wish the cards had been printed on thicker stock.

Great game, and completely unreadable instructions.  Having been warned about this, I studied them ahead of time and even did a play test by myself to make sure I understood everything.  Don't let the rules intimidate you. There is a game here and it's very good.  A bit on the longish side (90-120 min) but that could go much faster depending on how many players and what strategies they employ (I think more players=shorter game).  There are 3 social classes, peasants, merchants and bankers.  You move up social class by making money.  Peasants sell corn, wine and oil.  Merchants sell cloth and spice.  Bankers make money off of merchant sales and just by being bankers.  The mechanism is card drafting and cards produce goods, money and can be used to cost bankers money. The goal is to earn influence.  Merchants gain influence by foregoing some of the proceeds from their sales.  Bankers earn influence by buying artists at auction, building floors on the tower and donating to the church.   Game ends in 20 turns or if the a special art card is auctioned or if the 7th level of the tower is built.  Person with the most influence wins.

RATING: N/A

Pro: 
-) the progression between three roles, each with different rules and options.

Cons: 
-) Victory Points are awarded in random amounts;
-) the "artistic" board (I prefer functionality);
-) the cards (you will need a reference sheet; the cards have no text and no symbols, nor even a simple 1/2/3 dots to remember which roles can play each card. They are made of poor quality paper);
-) the Fate deck (a push-your-luck element appearing at most four times in each game, but occasionally able to have a huge impact on the local economy);
-) the "modifiers" to buy cards, to artificially hamper the leader (besides they quickly become irrelevant as so much money is generated that they simply become something to be tracked);
-) the poorly written rulebook.

Overall:
It tries to be a strategic game, but the result is mix of ideas badly blended and too much affected by luck.

Played once and watched played a couple times, so take the rating for what it's worth. I feel comfortable giving it a rating at this point because I feel its flaws are real and I don't see how repeated plays or anything else could really fix them.

There are two big problems with this game. One is accessibility. Because functionality is wantonly disregarded for the sake of art, the game ends up being very difficult to teach or learn because all actions/cards are identified by pictures with no words, and all the pictures are simply pieces of the same larger picture so it isn't exactly easy to tell them apart. Considering the game itself has unusual rules and gameplay, to have made the interface difficult is a major faux pas. 

The second and ultimately more pertinent problem is that it simply isn't that interesting of a game. A game like Siena  really makes me appreciate designers like Reiner Knizia who have such a talent for making games that are tense, have subtle interplay of mechanics, and have continual difficult decisions. Here none of the decisions feel important- it seems quite arbitrary whether you acquire any one individual item or take any one particular action, and the three stages of the game are so loosely tied together that it hardly strikes me as "neat". I know the following is a cliche phrase people often use to describe games they dislike but here the mechanics really do seem slapped together without any overarchingly intelligent reason or design. There is very little cohesion in this game and the rules are excessively fiddly for what you get, which is close to nothing in terms of tension or strategic or tactical value.

In the year 1338 the Siena’s Town Council charged the famous artist Ambrogio Lorenzetti to paint a fresco showing the town and its commerce. You will play the game above the painting that he made. You will start as Peasants, sowing the ground and selling your crop along the Via Francigena. If you will save enough florins you will be more comfortably off, trading in cloth and spices throughout Tuscany. But your dream is bigger: to enter the Council of the Nine, the town’s government. Therefore you will have to change into Bankers and use your money to obtain the Senesi’s consent: will you finance the artists of that time or contribute towards the construction of the new Torre del Mangia? Be careful, the florins that you have saved could not be enough! Behind every corner of the town other players’ pitfalls hide themselves: beggars, thieves, pretty women inside the inn... Be prepared for a unique game experience.

Caveat:  I haven't played the game, but feel a need to rate it anyway.  I set Siena up, and read the rules, playing along by myself as I go.  There is a huge problem - the cards and general play are totally non-intuitive, and I can't see playing it without a detailed player aid to figure out what is supposed to happen on each play.  I'm a pretty die-hard gamer, and I just can't see trying to explain this one to anyone.

Mario Papini takes a frickin' *painting* and turns it into a boardgame!  Think about that a second.  A painting that's been around for hundreds of years.  And Papini sees it and says, "I can make a boardgame out of that!"  And does.  And it's a solid board game.  Nothing spectacular or mind-blowing.  But its gameplay is solid and it is fun once you get past how to play.  Make sure to download the reference sheets for the cards from here and don't worry about doing well your first game; the first game of a game like Siena *needs* to be a learning game.  Trust me.

It's hard to pinpoint exactly why I find this game so fascinating.  I love the painting itself and that Papini could look at this artwork and envision a game blows me away.  It's one game that plays like three with very unique mechanics.  If you're willing to keep an open mind while learning Siena (it's not intuitive and perhaps difficult to understand without actually PLAYING) and use the player aids available here on BGG you will not be disappointed.  Go into your first game with the mindset that it will be a learning game and that you're on a quest to discover what this beautiful game is all about, you'll be pleasantly surprised.

Definitely a much better game than its rating suggests. So far, every game has been very different and I suspect that its less satisfactory aspects could fade with improved play. But we'll see.
UPDATE: The more I play, the better it gets. It's one of all too few games where you feel at the end that something has happened to you in the last two hours.
UPDATE AGAIN: Bumping this up to a 10. It's not perfect (e.g. what's the use of the 5-1 Guards card? I'm changing that to a 5-4), but the positives outweigh the negatives significantly. Always good, always different. Lots of decisions. Yes, the VPs can be skewed by luck, but who cares when you're having so much fun?

Entry-level deckbuilder. Works well for what it is. Identical to the DC deck-builder and similarly easy to teach and ligthweight. It's a little too simplistic for me, but one of the people I played with loved it so much that he went out and bought it. I think that's the sign of a great gateway game so it stays in my collection.

I really enjoy the cooperative aspect of this game.  The only downfall of this game is if someone gets a head start early.  The game is pretty much over with no chance of other players catching up.

It's [thing=125678][/thing] with a LOTR theme and some more complex card effects. Although I like the theme of this better I don't think it's as good a game.

* The artwork isn't as obvious - cards look too similar.
* Some of the cards are quite chaotic - there is one that gives you 1 power, unless you guess the top of your deck correctly, in which case it gives you 8 power.
* The added complexity of some of the cards doesn't really improve the game. The engine is very light and simple and convoluted cards don't really fit.

Based on the same engine as the DC Deckbuilding Game, this game is actually more well implemented and just more fun. It's not complicated nor sophisticated, but there is something to be said for it's simplicity. It just plays well, and I'm happy to play it when I want a light alternative deck building game.

Standard deck builder. The theme is a bit nonsensical and clearly opportunistic: Lord of the Rings protagonists competing for no apparent reason. Nothing special like Arctic Scavengers or Mage Knight. I'd rather play a more interesting game.

Solid, fast deckbuilder which serves as a great intro to the genre. This is based on the film, not the novels and extended universe like the Fantasy Flight LCG is. Same system as the DC Deckbuilding Game that I enjoy, so I like that you get to pick an individual character.

RATING: 3
Compared to other deck-builders, there isn't a whole lot for gamers to like. The gameplay is generic, simple, and one-dimensional. And the game suffers from a "rich get richer" problem and injects a lot of randomness into the mix (helpful/hurtful cards randomly come out during re-filling). I don't want to say the game plays itself, but it does have a "rinse and repeat" feeling.

That being said, for a mass-marketed game that is being directed at adolescents, who are more interested in LOTR than board games, it's not that bad. It has simple rules, fluid gameplay, and contains a lot of visually stunning pictures from the movie. I suspect some kids will adore this game.

Simple deck-building with only one currency (power). Impossible mode is pretty nasty. That card that gives you a 50/50 chance of losing automatically(Lurtz) is kind of dumb though in my opinion.

RATING: 7.25
The Lord of the Rings Deck-Building games are simple, fun, and can be combined together, which adds value to the series overall. Don't expect a story to develop, as these games are strictly competitive, mechanical point-grabbers. The movie stills are generally gorgeous, however, and it's a great way to engage Middle-Earth in a casual, lightweight way; I reach for these games often. [b]The Fellowship of the Ring[/b] is the lightest of the three games -- a straight up deckbuilder with simple combos and no twists -- but it is also, perhaps, the most visually stunning.

The LOTR Deck Building games are fun but are extremely light. Buy cards from the central row to get enough power to beat down the top Archenemy. I enjoy how each of the Fellowship heroes has their own special card in their starting decks as this gives just enough difference to the players. I usually only play this as a "trilogy" now, playing all 3 games in order and totaling the points from each game for an overall winner. My only real gripe in the game would be the screen caps. I would have much preferred art.

Very disappointing.  After the DC Comics deck building is so good, hoped this one would be good too.  But this one is WAAAAAY too much luck.  The word "random" appears on almost every enemy and on many, many other cards. And the random selections result in very harsh penalties quite often. And Boromir's special power is useless, starts as only 1 power and when it finally gets stronger it's buried in a large deck and seldom comes out.

RATING: 7.5
I actually enjoyed the simplicity of this game. The ever-changing market of cards gave it more of an "adventure" feel than other deckbuilding games and brought out the theme nicely (I do find it odd that there is not a cooperative option, though). I also prefer this to Dominion, which regardless of setup gets old pretty fast after the first few turns ("oh boy, I get to buy another market!"). I do feel that this game doesn't have the legs to last multiple plays though, even with the addition of new sets. But for a fun, light, casual deck building experience, it's pretty good.

I think I'm one of of the few who like this game.  I love the design of how the game plays out compared to some other deck builders.  You never know what will be available to purchase when it's your turn and there is player interaction with enemy cards and some others.  I can get more into the theme of LOTR instead of their DC Comics version.  I'm just not familiar enough with the heroes and villains to enjoy it enough.

Has made my oldest daughter's top 10 favorite games. This was her first deck-builder. The theme was what interested her - huge Lord of the Rings fan.
I got this series of games for a great price (less than 1/4 the price), but never thought I would get to play it - competitive with no good solo rules.
Has a poor reputation, but I actually enjoy playing it. We have created / are creating some cooperative rules so we can play as a team. Any LotR game where you play as the Fellowship needs to be cooperative - just feels wrong to be competing against other players.
Each game has a enough of a different game play to make them feel different.

Even after hundreds of games this one feels different each time. We combine Impossible mode with Normal mode when making up the deck. This makes the games very tense and exciting. 

Of the 3 Lord of the Rings games this one is the most fun. It has all the player interaction and interesting cards. The other two feel forced.

The Fellowship of the Ring Deck Builder is the all around best deck building game, simple to setup and play, interactive, playtime is just right. A deck building dream......
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a thoroughly enjoyable deck-building game!  In fact, as far as basic deck-building goes, it's one of the best I've ever played.  This box of cards has probably seen more play than most games in my collection.  The edges of the cards have begun to look green and worn.  I anticipate that this will always be a game I am willing and interested in playing.  Solid.

It also lends itself very well to a pretty satisfying solo variant.

Added(after finally playing several games of Return of the King): Now that I've played all three in the LoTR series, It's hard to pick a favorite, but it would be between this one and the second one.  This one is by far the most approachable of the three.  The card combos are simpler and it's pretty much a point grab.  As a result, it tends to have the shortest play time among them as well.  This one is refreshing to play after the second, and, especially, the third one.

It's basically Ascension with a Boss cards stack (think Penny Arcade), and with only one currency type. It doesn't bring anything new to the table, but it works and it's fun. Very random, but plenty of flavor.

Incidentally, the suggested age of 15 and up is nonsense. My 7-year-old had no problem with this. (Granted, he's played several other deck-builders, so he already had a handle on the mechanics.)

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Blatant rip off of some ideas from Dominion but they forgot to get the fun. Lots of cards with dumb/annoying powers that ask you to count your discard pile, count cards at the end, tediously add up lots of "power" points.

Beating/Buying enemy cards puts them into your hand to help you? Just one more thing that just doesn't work quite right.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Players play one of the characters from the Fellowship of the Ring, and build a deck of cards to defeat the enemies and score victory points.  Standard deck building stuff for these days - draw five, play, buy new cards and/or defeat enemies, which are all stuffed into your deck to make it stronger.  Nothing stands out in this one - it plays fast and cleanly.  It sort of lost me when I saw a couple of Elendil's in Aragorn's deck, as an Ally.  Elendil was Aragorn's great great (repeat another 30 or so times) grandfather.  What's he doing there?!  Thematically suspect for this Tolkien purist!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A solid deck-builder. The game mechanics are easy to pick up but allow for a good deal of strategy when building your deck. The flavor is great, it feels like a LoTR game. If you're a big fan of this universe I highly recommend checking this out. If you own Ascension however, you can probably pass on this one. The games feel very similar.

There are many deck builders, and these Cryptozoic Cerebrus engine ones are all pretty generic.  With better modern twists on the idea (like Mystic Vale) available and mitigating the terrible randomness of the marketplace of cards available to purchase, I don't see any space for any Ascension clones in my collection.

[b]previous comment:[/b]

This is a reasonably fun deck builder, albeit fairly random, and with much less replay value than a game like Dominion, since you play with the entire set of cards instead of mix-and-match.

The "ambush" mechanic is pretty fun, though.

I feel like this game would be a solid intro to deck builders for folks who aren't quite up to Dominion.  It's got a strong theme, a good bit of randomness which helps level the playing field for new players, and the ability to vary the game length by changing the number of baddies you include.

The LotR deck-building game is what you get when you put Dominion, Ascension and Thunderstone in a blender. Interestingly, and in spite of some rather arbitrary and random effects, I enjoyed it more (sometimes a lot more) than either of those.

A light romp for Tolkien fans, I suppose.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This fell flat for my wife and me.  We both play a lot of Ascension, and compared to Ascension this game seems to lack meaningful choices and strategy.  Preventing the center from refilling during a turn takes away more strategy than it adds.  Some of the cards (Legolas?) seem very OP.  

I also thought that the game's final boss card was a letdown.  A single LotR game that incorporated all three movies would have been better.

All that said, I do like the boss mechanic, and the addition of a hardcore/advanced mode is a nice touch.

First impressions were good, very fun and simple and easy. Simplicity is definitely the draw here.

But further plays show that there's just nothing to do. You win or lose based on what cards come out for you. And you can get blown out early and have no chance, if someone starts killing Archenemies. Since those are the most powerful cards available, and worth the most points, the game snowballs from there.

One does not simply... play this game and expect to have much fun. Draw five cards, count up your "power" and then buy zero or more cards from a random selection. Rinse and repeat.

Simple deck building game with some serious running leader problem. 
Nice game to play from time to time if the theme is for you, but not exactly a gamer game. A lot of game outcome is based purely a luck.

I'm sure this works well for Ascension fans.  I don't care for Ascension, and the ambush effects make this game even more arbitrary and random than Ascension.

Players who are lucky at the start of the game will win the game, since they will be able to buy a lot of cards on their turn and thus trigger ambushes for the next player, who can then no longer buy new cards and thus will never be able to catch up.

Got this game for $10 in an auction. Wasn't going to get it because it looked exactly like their DC game but there's enough differences to make it stand on it's own for a similar but different game experience. And, it's a lot of fun.

Another ascension like deck-builder with the Thunderstone mechanic of keeping the bad guys you beat. Take control of a character and fight for the ring. Rather play this than Ascension, but not by much, and would much rather play a lot of other things anyways.

A simple deck building game that is surprisingly fun.  I like the fact that the number of cards that come out will vary widely.  Dominion and Thunderstone have set cards but these cards will come out at different times or not at all.  I like the path rules with the ambushes and the different card types.  Overall a fun little deckbuilder and a much maligned game.

Below average Dominion clone with some of the usual modifications (cards on offer at random - Ascension; defeated enemies go into your deck - Thunderstone; etc.)..
The theme is a classic "pasted on" license.
Forgettable (if not just bad, but I've no desire to play it more to verify it).

Do you like LoTR?  Do you like deckbuilding games like Ascension or Dominion?  Then get this!  Nothing all that revolutionary about the game or its design, but it is fun.  Easy to learn, plays fast, and is good mindless entertainment.  My only gripe is that our Galadriel card has a printing error.  Looking forward to The Two Towers and Return of the King expansions so we can create an epic deckbuilding adventure through Middle Earth!

Fun deck builder, not EXACTLY thematic when you think hard about it. But it doesn't usually come up in the game as you're enjoying yourself too much. Great artwork (taken from the films). Easy to understand and play. 

Fortune cards can swing the game play and it should be ensured they are shuffled properly (if two or three come out at once that player is almost guaranteed a win). Similarly, try to make sure the first five on the path don't include a fortune as can quite quickly imbalance the game from the first turn.

This game is what I wanted the DC Deckbuilding game to be. There aren't any super broken/powerful cards that make the game feel really onesided.

BEST GAME EVER PERIOD.  I will burn all my other games and only place this one from now on.  I assume there is a Two Towers and Return of the King versions coming soon.  I am so FRAKING excited to play all three in order.

It plays very similar to the Penny Arcade Gamers v Evil but even better. In PAGvE the Coins versus Power was a little convoluted so with only Power in this game it plays much smoother and I love the LOTR theme over Penny Arcade any day of the week and twice on Sunday.

My only complaint is when I sleeved all my cards they did not fit back in the box.  Not a big deal but annoying.  They should know good gamers sleeve their cards sillies!

Not my favorite deck-builder, but it has its charm. I prefer Dominion, simply for the fact that I feel that Fellowship starts to drag, or I just don't care for the bosses. My favorite part of the game is the "One does not simply walk into Mordor" card, I can't help but chuckle every time I see it.

at first i thought this was a carbon copy of the dc deck builder but i was wrong. As much as i like the theme of dc the cards in LoTR are better, more complex and fun. There is more deck manipulation and added treasure cards that give players a small edge. The enimies are more difficult and the game is overall just better.

Cryptozoic releases differently themed versions of its one deckbuilding game the same way Hasbro releases differently themed versions of Monopoly.  Since the appeal is carried entirely by the theme, this game is a miss for a non-Lord of the Rings fan like myself.

RATING: 6
Very simple Ascension-style of deckbuilding game, with only one unit to keep track of, which makes everything rather samey.

The fact that the expansions don't quite work well together made the whole game a pain to own, as they feel and play differently and get watered down a great deal in any attempt to mix them.

They can be fun in a light way, but they can also drag with turns full of painful nothingness.

Ultimately, there's too many great deck-builders out there that can easily replace these.

The only thing this brings new to the table in this in-game deck-building genre is the theme. Everything else is pretty much a blend of Ascension et al, except simplified even further. You buy from a common draft that's re-filled after each turn. There's only one currency and that's power. Once you have enough power, beat the big boss that's on top of the big boss deck for big VPs, same as Legendary. Big boss, good guy, all the same, doesn't matter, they just go into your deck - there's no distinguishing. It's playable because the genre is playable, but there's nothing in it to attract me to this particular game over any other in the genre, barring theme. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's pretty much the same formula as Ascension, DC Deck-Builder and Star Realms but the ambushes add a little excitement. It's a little long, but for LotR fans it's probably worth it. If I had a choice I'd rather play Star Realms but if I have the time I'll play it.

It's a deckbuilder (isn't every game nowadays?) with a fine theme but the gameplay is too random/chaotic for the length of the game.

I thought the single "power" to defeat/purchase would be more streamlined, but in reality it seems to perpetuate great starts.

The balance/hinder mechanisms built into the cards that allow players to direct their charity/vengeance to other players who are (perceived to be) losing/winning is an interesting spin on the take-that mechanic.

The basic mechanics of this game are absolutely terrible. The entire game is already decided in the first few rounds, whoever has the best luck setting up will ultimately end up with the most powerful deck very quickly, which only continues to ramp.

To make matters worse, the next player to go is the one who suffers from a player making a big grab, thanks to the game's ambush mechanic, which essentially punishes players just for having their turn be after a successful player's.

We played a 3 player game, which was an absolute disaster. I didn't even feel challenged, while my friend wasn't even able to play with a full hand half his turns. I can't even imagine how awful this would be as a 2 player game.

Stick with deck builders like Ascention, Artic Scavangers, or Dominion.

Update: I recently played Legendary, a marvel deckbuilder by the same company that was released well before LoTR, and was a bit surprised to find they were virtually the same game. The only difference is that Legendary is a cooperative game with fewer ambush cards; it's less likely you'll hurt the next person to play as it is in LoTR, and in your best interest not to in the first place. In a competitive game with a much larger percentage of ambushes, it's a completely broken mechanic that causes inescapable Runaway Leader problems.

What the heck happened here? I hate Lord of the Rings! I hate cards with photos! I hate elves! I hate too many things and should have hated this game! But I didn't. I wish the starting character did a little more to shape the course of your game (i.e. putting a unique power on the base mat and not a card to come up in your deck) but overall I've had a surprising amount of fun with this game.

This is a great, easy DBG.  An easy way to introduce people to DBGs, especially if they already like LoR.  The theme isn't as strong as it could be.

My primary complaint with the game is the Ambush mechanic. If a player has a big turn and buys a large amount on the path the next player is almost ensured to pay the price. The game already has a randomness aspect to it and this mechanic only serves to broaden the gap. Personally, I plan to houserule that the player doing the BUYING gets the ambush as a means to even out the playing field.

I'm a big Ascension and deck-building fan so anything that even remotely plays like that is going to start off on the right foot.  This is kind of a DC DBG clone (which I also like) and the cards are very thematic.  My 6 year-old daughter loves it and understands it, so that's another big plus.  The look on her face when she defends against an ambush or attacks me is priceless.  This is a solid 8 and will likely go up with additional plays as well as expansions.  I know it probably isn't everyone's cup of tea, but it's excellent.  Great stuff!

This is the first game I've played that I would describe as "horrifyingly bad".

The balance of the cards is terrible. Turns get borked by randomly-triggered events because reasons. The LotR flavor is nonexistent. The art is bad. The cards are badly designed, with excessive text that is small and hard to read. There are too many unique cards that are entirely uninteresting. The scoring system rewards... well, nothing, really, it almost feels like the winner is being determined at random.

Not only does this have the random cards for purchase thing that so many deck-building games use (and it doesn't work any better here than it does anywhere else), this has victory points on every card.

Yep, this is the DC Comics Deck-Building Game, just with a few extra mechanisms and a new theme.  I haven't played either of them enough to know if the card abilities are duplicated one-for-one, but I doubt the designers were that blatant about it.  I'm not really fond of the Fortune cards -- the cards you get to buy on your turn are already pretty random, and now you have one that you can't really refuse to buy, too? -- nor am I wild about the semi-cooperative aspect of everyone losing if the deck runs out, but I'd play it again if someone else wanted to.  I feel the same way about the DC game, too, though.

Decent family or beer n' pretzels deck-builder.  Random events and ambushes lead to blatant unfairness, so be sure to lose gracefully.

I'll always play this or Marvel Legendary over Dominion (which I actively avoid), which should help clarify my gaming sensibilities.  I'm a former hardcore Eurogamer who has gone off the reservation, and it's unlikely that I'll ever return.

Well, that was a surprise. The impossible Archenemies aren't just harder.  They're also hilariously nasty and broken.  What to expect: Extreme entertainment, and possibly a stroke or coronary.

There is a disconnect with theme (why is Frodo attacking Arwen?) but I can overlook it once gameplay starts since my love for LotR and deckbuilding conquers all.  Yay!

Bonus points for anything LotR. Good LCG with a lot of replay. Some of the enemy decks feel imbalanced, but I still have a good time with this game. Deck building is fun.

This game is actually good and very very fun!  Huge surprise.  Captures the theme perfectly, and very fun game play. 

My only house rule suggestion would be able to hold back cards.

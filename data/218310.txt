I enjoyed the game, even playing with the "basic" or "starter" set of cards.  There's room for strategy, but also quite a bit of guesswork/randomness due to having a lot of different classes and colors and trying to make due with what you have in your hand.

There are similarities to Parade and Uno, as you do not want points but you are somewhat limited in what you are able to play each round.  Also, "shooting the moon" is a thing if you get majorities in all colors that you have in your tableau, and it feels amazing.

Would not need to own, as I feel it has too much going on for a trick-taking game.

The game's scoring mechanism is interesting but it also makes it fairly opaque on what your "best play" is especially earlier in the hands. I find it difficult to gauge your hand strength and all the card powers tend to feel more "mechanical" than I'm actually doing something productive for myself. The game offers moments to feel clever and the production quality/variety is very high but overall it's not a go-to trick taker for me. I would rarely pass up a play though.

Clever and customize-able trick-taking game. Takes a couple plays to understand the card interactions, but a real blast once you do.

Should I wait for this game to be available at the Miniature Market to buy at a cheaper price.  I think currently I can occupy myself with The Grizzled and hopefully I can get Godforsaken Scavengers as a card game to be played with multiple players.

Not forgetting, I have yet to leverage on another trick taking game which is Battle of Durak.  Would need to study the origin of this game on Wiki.

For me, while I still had some amount of fun playing, Trickster is a game that ended up being less fun than the sum of its parts.

If you really like trick-takers, it has some elements of trick taking games, but doesn't end up feeling like a trick taker.

If you like card powers with various interactions, they're here, but I felt like they made the game feel a bit random and swingy. This element was kind-of-sort-of-fun in a "let's play and see what happens" sort of way, but ultimately in a way that also felt like you may perhaps not have a lot of control over your destiny.

The various powers and potential for lots of different combinations of those powers in any given game is neat-o, and would likely result in very different feeling games depending on the combos. Game to game variability is rightfully all the rage, and this covers that base well.

Overall, a game I'd play without hesitation if someone else suggested, but I'm not super eager to suggest myself, as it just didn't grab me.

Relatively easy to get to know but with different deck combinations strategy kicks in hard. Excellent artwork. 
I think there is room expansion for example, where each player has character or hero with unique ability.

[110] The core trick / trickster concept is fantastic, and the scoring is interesting. The special powers bogged things down in my one play - familiarity would help with that, I expect.

RATING: 6
Feels like Palastgefluester, Diamonds, and Parade all rolled into one.  I'm pretty sure that wasn't the design intent, however.   The main innovation here is that the 2nd player in a trick decides to match suit or rank (or neither) and that sets the rule everyone else must follow for the trick.   Every card played triggers an ability, which is a bit slow but necessary.   The scoring is like Parade in that you either want the most of a color, or none at all, ideally.   

I was put off by the art, although it sounds like others really liked it.   I found it to be a bit off (features out of proportion, bad lighting) and I can only compare it to Polar Express or Police Precint which have the same creepy issues.   Anyway, that's just me.   

The theme or flavor makes zero sense.  Zero.  Doesn't matter much, though.

The game takes a long time just to play 3 hands because pretty much every card in every trick triggers a special action which has to be evaluated on the spot and can't be planned for.   If this game played in half the time, it would be better.

This is such a fantastic trick taking game.  I enjoy playing hearts with the right group, but you really need exactly 4 people to make it fun.  Trickster adds a new spin on trick taking and I personally feel it is best with 5 to 7 players.

Played once. Some good ideas here. Fans of trick taking games may like this, although the game definitely changes at the higher player counts. May be a bit random, but more plays are needed to fully assess.

An extremely clever trick taking game. The basic deck is really good for teaching the flow of the game, but moving to the advanced setup allows for some more strategic thinking that's missing from the basic deck.

All in all, a real hit. My family an I played it for about 3-4 hours back to back.

I like trick taking games. I used to think that they were generally shunned in my group but the better answer is more that light and short games are thus shunned. We'll usually opt for something longer, unless we're waiting for someone, and then we usually bend towards just a few things we already know.

Still, I like these games. I don't tend to like super weirdo trick-taking games in which each card has some kind of special power that changes the game or jumps stuff around or otherwise adds complications for their own sake.

Trickster is a game in which all the cards have special powers that jump things around, BUT it's not as bad as others. You only play with 7 heroes at a time, so there are only 7 powers in play, and they're all pretty simple. Tricks you win go into your score pile where they'll give you unwanted points unless you can grab more of a color/suit than others. So (at least in the beginner set of heroes) the rules of the trick stay the same and the powers just move things around to switch up your hand or score pile. 

We played a rule wrong on round one and had to quit after only two of three rounds, so we didn't get a full game, but there was enough that I liked what I saw and am eager to play more. I'd like to play more shorter, lighter games.

A fun Trick taking game, where you make a deck of several characters (each with a "when played" ability), and each come in several colors. Someone leads, and then someone begins the patter of all the same character/color/or unique run. The goal of the game is to get fewer points and run out of cards first. The game is so simple to learn, but rich with fun choices with the cards neat abilities.

"Bad-Likely won't play this again" sums it up pretty well.  I just don't see where the control lies with this game.  I'm going to try and get it to the table again, but it's going to be a struggle considering everyone's opinion of the first game.  I'm hoping I missed something of the tactics or strategy, but I doubt it.

My rating is based on a 2-player play so far. I like the concept of the game, but in 2-player it almost seems reversed. You are better off winning most of the tricks and having lots of cards in your tableau since you will have more than your opponent.

Good trick building game.  Like how the hero powers can really alter what you're trying to collect.  I've seen several rounds where players get a ton of tricks they had no intention of collecting or vise versa.

Having multiple heroes to choose from really makes each game unique and gives it a lot of replay potential.

[Indie Boards & Cards 17 Kickstarter edition with Grand Gambit expansion] {Fantasy; trick-taking, take-that; optimal 4-5p} Cute little customizable trick taking game.  Full of take-that elements to spoil opponents.  The aim is to avoid taking tricks.  The twist here is the Trickster is the second player after the lead player.  He/she chooses the goal of this trick: match colour, match hero, or no match.  If Trickster can successfully make an opponent can't play any card, he/she wins; otherwise, he/she busts.  Player who busts need to take the trick.  So, Trickster shall count cards in order to avoid tricks.  Another twist is the scoring, the aim is to have the lowest score to win.  But, similar to Hearts, if you can collect the most cards in a suit, you score 0.  This scoring way adds so much fun to the game: players can screw other players by taking cards from their tableaus.  So player interaction is good in this game.

The rule is simple.  Set up is simple.  But the explanation of Hero cards may take sometime.

The 2/3p rules are so ... artificial.  If we need a dummy player this way, I would rather drop the 2/3p out of the player range.

The illustration is average - colourful, but not too attracting.  And the publisher shall select another hero as the box cover.

Basically hearts with card abilities. Light fun game. One game lasted a bit too long with a full group of people and a deck of cards that couldn't affect the outcome (since the deck itself was non-existant). Cool artwork and easy to learn.

Trickster is a trick taking-ish game where you don't want to take cards. There are eight colors and seven roles (56 cards). You start with a hand of cards equal to the number of players plus four. Then you choose one of those to put into your tableau. There's also a "trash" pile of six or so cards.

Whoever lost the last trick takes the lead. The second player (the "trickster") decides which way to spin the trick. If he follows the leaders color, then all cards to the trick must match that color. Anyone who can't follow takes all the played cards into their tableau. If the trickster follows the role, then everyone must follow the role. Anyone who can't takes all the played cards into their tableau. If the trickster doesn't match either, then everyone must play a card that's different from all the played colors and roles. Again, if they can't, the cards go into their tableau. If everyone is able to follow the trick, then the trickster has to put all the played cards into their tableau. At the end of the game cards in your tableau count against you... unless you have the most of that color, in which case they don't count at all.

Additionally, each role card has an effect when played. Mostly they move cards around, from your tableau to the trash, your tableau to someone else's, someone else's tableau to your hand, etc. There's one card that forces you to swap a card from your hand with someone else's card from their hand.

The game looks like it'll be a light filler, but there's actually a fair bit to think about. That's both a positive and a negative. It's neat that there's some depth to the game, but it also pushes this a bit longer than what I'd consider a filler. It's not really beyond filler though, so it's kind of just a long filler game. I'd like to try it with fewer players, as I think that would help with the length.

First things first, the advertised Playing Time is cobblers. This game usually takes an hour with 5 people.
That said, its still a good game in the trick-taking mould, but does lots of things quite differently. Being the 2nd player (who sets the trick) can be nerve-wracking as play goes around the table and you hope someone...anyone will be unable to play, otherwise YOU bust and have to take all the cards. Or maybe you WANT to get all the cards!
How do you manage your hand during a round? what tricks do you set? how do you manage your tableau? and the special powers, what about them?

Great game, and the ability to mix-and-match different decks to vary the abilities that are in play means it stays fresh for quite a while. I bought this at the same time as Custom Heroes, and while CH is a fun game, this one hits the table more often.

I liked this more than I thought I would, being a "memory" game and all.  This is more a bluffing game, and the memory element is quite minor.  The components and box size can't be beat!  Clever design and plays quite smoothly.  A keeper.

RATING: 6
A somewhat counterintuitive deduction game in which the aim is more often to bluff opponents into picking the wrong suspect than it is to guess whodunnit correctly. What each player knows is slightly different and through clever play you can deny an opponent key information.

If that sounds intriguing, well it is a bit.  On the down side, I wonder about replay value. Once you get the idea, what you should do and the odds of success are pretty calculable.

The Moonster edition has minimalist good looks to match the game design and the component quality is pretty decent.

A stripped back bluffing and deduction game that has probably been reduced a little too far.  Often there's not enough information to make it true deduction, so you end-up playing the odds with limited information.  Not much replayability, and OK as a quick filler but I'm not convinced there's too much of a game here.

This is a fun murder-mystery deduction game by Oink Games. Of course, being from Oink the components are top notch! I enjoy this game quite a bit, but wish it could handle another player or two in order to really up the deduction difficulty level. Good stuff, highly recommended if you like this game mechanic!

My rating here is mixed. I would rate it a 6 with 4 players, and an 8 with 3. The reason for this is that with 4, there is a lot more guesswork and less deduction and bluffing.

Er zijn 8 silhouetten die genummerd zijn van 2-8 of blanco zijn. Drie van deze silhouetten worden in het midden geplaatst als verdachten en één als slachtoffer. Elke speler ontvangt ook een silhouet. De spelers geven silhouetten door, mogen ontvangen silhouetten bekijken, silhouetten in het midden verwisselen en moeten uiteindelijk een silhouet beschuldigen. Als elke speler een silhouet beschuldigd heeft, dan wordt gekeken wie de werkelijke dader is en welke spelers de juiste dader aangewezen heeft en begint een nieuwe ronde. door deductie ontdekken wie de moord heeft gedaan. het hoogste getal is de moordenaar, als er een 5 bij de verdachten zit is het laagste getal de moordenaar 1,6

Nice to see a deduction game in the Oink line, but this is my least favorite of the series.   The game is very repetitive and blind guesses are just as good as educated guesses.  There is no reward for working out the best scenario, because people can act somewhat randomly in order to bluff.

Only played this once a few months pack and have limited recollection on it. Basically, you're trying to deduce information based on the limited information you receive. There is a bluffing element too which is used to try and eliminate a player, which causes the end the game. I recall thinking it was cute, but there are a health dose of bluffing/deduction games out there these days. I enjoyed it more than some because of the lack of a player elimination mechanism however.

[floatleft][ImageID=2691555][/floatleft]This is a lightning fast deduction, and sometimes bluffing, game. There are tiles numbered 2 to 8 and one blank. Each player takes a tile and looks at it then tiles are passed to the right. Three of the remaining tiles are placed in the middle of the table and the fourth slightly off to the side, or rotated as in the picture below. The start player looks at two of the three tiles in the middle of the table then they can choose to swap one of the three with the tile set aside. Then they place their biding token on one of the three tiles in the middle. Each other player gets a turn going left-wise. On your turn you look at the two tiles in the middle that your right neighbor did not bid on, then you bid on one of the three tiles. The goal is to bid on the highest tile of the three in the middle, unless the 5 is present among those tiles, then your goal is to bid on the lowest.

[center][ImageID=1030248 medium][/center]

Being the last to bid incorrectly on a tile is bad you take all the incorrect bidding tokens and those act as negative points. If you bid correctly you get your bidding token back. You play a few rounds in this fashion and then someone wins, that will be the player with the fewest bidding tokens, therefore you want to fool your opponents and have them take your bidding token. You can't ask much more of a 10 minute game, there are lots of opportunity for clever play. You can mislead, you can risk big, you can play it safe. You can deduce what tiles are on the table, but also what your opponents might do depending on your own actions. It's a lot of fun to reveal the tiles and hear what everyone was thinking and what decisions they made based on the information at hand. It's cute, it's clever, and it works. I'm not much of a fan of these micro-games though, so only a 7 for me, but if you like the genre then you should like it even more.

[size=8]Oh yea, the theme is about murder or something, which is why the tile is bleeding on the cover :P[/size]

Deduction with incomplete information. The heart of the matter is not to guess the culprit correctly but to trick others into making wrong decisions.

RATING: 5
Eight sticks numbered 2 thru 8 and a blank. There's 3 in the middle. Which is highest? You've seen 2 in the middle and 2 of the 4 that aren't in play. Is the one you haven't seen higher than the ones you have. It's a straight odds calc. Or is it the special 5 which means you're trying to bet on which is lowest? That's the decision. If other people have gone before you, you can take their bets into consideration, based on whether you think the info they have (they'll have seen different sticks) is better than yours. There's an alleged bluffing angle where a player before you deliberately plays incorrectly so as to sucker you into betting with him (last one on an incorrect bet gets all the negative points). Sometimes bets are obvious, especially if you've seen the 5 out of play and you turn over an 8. Other-times, it's a risk-based play. It's all too straightforward really to be much of a game, and each round is much the same as the previous, meaning each game is made up of doing the same thing over and over. Slightly interesting but not a lot of replay. It is over fairly quickly so it does slip into that opener filler niche if you're looking for variety.

his is a small fast game where you use deduction to find the culprit of a murder. There is a crime scene of a victim and three suspects. Each player may only see two suspects. The suspect with the highest number is the culprit, unless the 5 is in the group of suspects, then the suspect with the lowest number is the culprit.

The suspect that you accused is precisely the one that the player after you cannot inspect. So, you are keeping information away.

If you only focus on deduction then you will not win the game because it is precisely the intention to deceive the other players! Very fun game where you often will see confused faces. Tip!

RATING: 4
It seems like the game's only interesting if you're the first player in a round; you have the greatest opportunity for bluffing. The last player has more of a deductive challenge.

However, neither the bluffing part nor the deductive part vary enough to merit repeated play.

Played once with 4P. A microgame involving bluffing and deduction. Each round has players taking a guess at which of the three central silhouettes has the highest value. There is some information to work with, and players have to pay attention to the guesses of previous players as well. 

Despite its minimal premise, Hattari is a rather clever game which involves a bit of brainpower. Although it looked like we had a 'runaway loser' at first, the game eventually balanced out and it came down to the final round where one wrong move would lead to any of the four players losing the game. However, this also had the unfortunate consequence of the game running a bit long for my liking.

1 play, 4er

This is a very clever, quick-playing, bluffing/deduction micro game, packaged in one of those great little boxes sized almost like tarot cards. You're trying to deduce which of the 3 suspects is the murderer. OR, you bluff well enough to make players after you choose the wrong person (the one you chose)! Whoever does either or both well enough wins! The mix of bluffing and deduction, in such a small package, really makes this an interesting way to fill 15 minutes!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
There are 8 cards (actually, tiles in the shape of a person) with numbers 2-8 and one blank. At the start (4er game):
- everyone is dealt one card to look at, then pass to the right (so everyone sees 2 cards).
- three are placed face down in the center (suspects)
- the last is set aside face down (victim). 
Starting player takes a turn:
- look at 2 of the 3 center cards (suspects)
- optionally, trade any of the 3 with the set-aside (victim) card
- place one of your Accusation Markers on one of the 3 in the center.
Everyone else, in clockwise order, takes a similar turn except:
- no swapping
- may not look at the just Accused suspect card 

After everyone's turn, reveal the 3 center cards:
- Goal is to have Accused the highest numbered card, [i]unless[/i] one of the other two is the 5-card -- that flips things around and makes the [i]lowest[/i] numbered card the guilty suspect. The blank is always innocent.
- Players who were correct get their Marker back.
- Incorrect Markers go to whoever guessed that suspect last (marker on top of stack).

Then, First Player rotates clockwise and you play again. Play until either a player has no Markers remaining, or someone has 8+ markers: the player with the fewest Markers wins!

Entertaining bluffing/deduction game where players attempt, with limited information, to [-]finger a suspected murderer[/-]identify the highest/lowest numbered card in a lineup, having seen 2/3 suspects and also 2/5 of the remaining cards.

Ok game, where you simply play a set of cards for 4 round, each round differing in value from the last (loser loses 2 coins, winner takes 3, loser is out of the game, winner takes all coins). So once you get that variable reward down, card-play becomes a repetitive: buy two cards before the game (unless you already have 2 winning sets) and value your other sets. Winning set should go last, second-best set second last unless you are sure no-one cares about that round. But usually, they do. If third best set is good enough: play in round 2. Otherwise play in round one and dump something in round 2. Repeat.

Easy game, plays in literally 5 minutes but replay value is not so much. Would prefer actual Texas Hold'm poker over this.

What an odd little game! It's certainly better with 3 than 2 and probably better with 4 than with 3. In fact, I'd be inclined to say that this is only really a 4 player game. 

Which is fine by the way. It's a great little game.

A little bluffing, a little deprivation of choices and a playing time of about 15 minutes make this a winner.

I love the simple graphic design too.

RATING: 7
Hattari is a devilishly simple deduction game, yet there is a fair amount of luck involved in the deduction process that one cannot help but feel that the game is more chaotic than it looks. While there certainly is an element of bluffing, the third and fouth players are generally locked out from making useful guesses and have to decide if the previous players have enough information between them to pull off a clever bluff. Some cards/suspects are more useful than others and if you have the right hand to bluff, then one ought to do it.

In any case, it is still tough to wrap my head around the different deduction elements of the game. More plays are required at this point. However, the scoring of the game feels a little wonky. It appears that getting 8 deduction tokens is not that tough. Game can end relatively early and abruptly.

I played this over the weekend and was pleasantly surprised. I was a bit wary after watching a few negative reviews but we all enjoyed it. Light deduction game with some nice mind tricks with other players accusations. It took us over 20mins but i am hoping it will settle at around 30min max. Small box and great on windy days/nights when outdoors.

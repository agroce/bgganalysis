Decent dex game.  Great production quality.  I was worried that the coconuts would fly everywhere, but they really didn't.  I don't think the cards really add anything and I won't be using them again, but otherwise plays quite smoothly.

If you have kids and you have a way to not lose these things, this is the game for you!  They'll have a blast throwing coconuts around!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A great dexterity game in which the issue of the catapults actually working is solved and plays in about 25minutes. The coconut ammunition is also bouncy which makes it hilarious when it goes into a cup only to bounce out.  
Downside is that the coconuts do go everywhere and if not careful could go missing and they can't be replaced by just anything as they fit the catapult in size and bounce factor. 
An Overall absolutely entertaining to watch and play. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
1st play: Not sure why it's rated #1.  It's fine, a kid's dexterity game with a fun premise.  The monkey arms fling the coconuts with a bit more power and a bit less control than I'd like, but the kids seemed to like it?  I dunno - a meh for me.

No 2nd play: Some games don't need a second play.  I'm completely neutral about whether I play this again.

RATING: 7
The whole idea of flicking balls into cup isn't new. But despite being a bit gimmicky, this game works. The theme makes it incredibly atmospheric and the launchers are well-built, sturdy, and they have an appropriate launch arch to them. I can't understate how important the latter characteristics are... the sturdiness and appropriate launch arch makes the game feel more skillful, which is very important for a dexterity game. There is still a huge unknown on how the coconuts will bounce, but overall... it feels like a game that rewards multiple plays.

I like it quite a bit. Only negative is it looks more like a "toy" than a game... but it's still damn cool. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
After having tried Flying Kiwis which I found ok, I believe Coconuts is the better game. It does not have the frantic rhuthm of a real-time game (like the Kiwis) but honestly I prefered the absence of this aspect. Nice and sturdy components (nothing fancy) especially considering its price. Highly enjoyable, especially with kids in the mix.

I really like this game. It is a ton of fun with my son. Unfortunately, the fun starts to break down with more than two players. Overall, it's exciting to get a cool trick shot into a high cup. The cards add some interesting strategy to the game. And my son loves it. Coconuts doesn't actually sit with my collection. It pretty much belongs to my son and stays in his room with his collection.

Initial Impressions:

I really think this is an interesting dexterity game, however I do wish the card play was more interesting.  The quality of the game (especially for the price) is amazing.  the launchers feel very sturdy, and I am amazed that I was able to get an Import copy for around $29 considering the quality.  

This is one I see staying around for awhile, as I can really bust this out within any group setting (family, friends, Co-Workers).

Kids love it, and it does require quite a bit of thought and care to do well, so it's surprisingly educational. Don't think the cards and overall game design are great, but the components are very well made.

Somehow, though we all like it, we don't pull it down and play it often. It feels somehow like a bit of a chore.

Part of the blame lies in the packaging: it's always spilling out or not closing all the way.

Great game for young kids. It requires no reading and very little rule memorization. Players take turns trying to catapult coconuts into cups - helping develop fine motor skills as launching the hardest overshoots cups, but you get more points when you aim for the red cups. It is competitive - there is a winner. But it can get uber-competitive if you allow the rule that you can steal cups from other players. It's fun, quick, and exciting for young kids and is one of the few games my 5 year old niece could play that did not bore her 8 year old brother.

I'm not sure how I could ever turn down a game of Coconuts.  The game is as simple as launching some rubber coconuts into some cups using a spring-loaded monkey.

The goal is to build a pyramid of cups; each time you get a coconut to land in a cup, you add it to your pyramid.  But, hold up!  Players can steal cups from each other by landing them in cups that are in other players' pyramids!

Also, when you land a coconut in a cup, you leave it in the cup, so the game can end by there being no more coconuts to shoot, in which case the player with the most coconuts in their partially completed pyramid of cups wins.  So, not only do you want to build your pyramid while keeping others from doing so, but you also want to steal the cups that are full of coconuts in case the games ends without anyone completing a pyramid.

Overall, just a fun an addicting game!

An amusing 20 minute dexterity game. The monkey catapults and the bouncy coconuts work really well. The 'take-that' style cards are the weakest part and I wouldn't bother with them. The ending is poor if you are behind and can't win (each cup won would require one coconut). Perhaps the last coconut should be reused as if you had claimed a red cup to provide a possible catch-up mechanic.

Dexterity game involving launching coconuts via catapulting monkey. Mainly for the kids but still entertaining for adults. It's very difficult to successfully aim and get a coconut where it's intended to go. The cards coming with the game are a joke, but so is the game. I could play a game of this here and there for some laughs, but it's nothing I would want to play on a consistent basis.

Coconuts is a blast to play. Easy to learn, easy to teach. You use cute Monkeys to catapult rubber Coconuts into cups. If the Coconut lands in a cup and stays in a cup (they sometimes bounce out.) you place the cup on your play area. To win you need 6 cups in your play area stacked like a pyramid, 3 on the bottom, 2 in the middle and 1 on top. 

If another player catapults a Coconut into a cup in your play area they steal that cup from you and place it in their play area. This simple rules makes Coconuts very competitive and the group gangs up on the leader to prevent an easy win. 

Mayday Games has a hit on their hands. Even my non gamer friends enjoy Coconuts. It is solid game to play with young children and players of any age. Why are you reading this? Go play a fun game of Coconuts.

If a coconut throwing monkey threw a coconut at Loopin Louie, Louie's plane would go DOWN.  Coconuts can easily be listed as being #1 in the children's category.

That being said, I always have played with adults as an "end of the night" kind of game, and we have ALWAYS had a blast with this game.  The ONLY reason I have not rated this game a 10 is I want to see how much staying power it has.

Nos bénévoles sont de grands enfants. On leur met à disposition des jeux où il faut réfléchir, anticiper, planifier, avec des cubes en bois et des meeples …

Et bien, qu’est-ce qu’ils choisissent comme coup de cœur ?  Coco King

Parce que les bénévoles sont très joueurs. Alors, quand on leur met entre les mains un singe articulé, permettant de catapulter des noix de coco sur toute la table de jeu, toute rationalité est mise de côté.

L’objectif reste quand même de lancer les noix de coco dans les gobelets des autres joueurs. Mais si on loupe notre coup, c’est tout aussi drôle d’essayer de rattraper ces petites billes rebondissantes (oui, car on ne joue pas avec des vraies noix de coco).

Et croyez-le, croyez-le pas, on a de vrais champions de lancer de noix de coco, permis nos bénévoles ! N’hésitez pas à les défier !

At some point someone is going to put beer in the cups, if it hasn't happened already, and this little game may change the world...

Edit: it's still a great game but I don't know how much play it's going to get now that I built my Tumblin' Dice set. Downgraded rating only because of the comparison.

Great silly dexterity game for the whole family. Lots of laughter every time we play. Would recommend for kids of all ages. There are some skill involved but mostly it's about luck as the coconuts bounce around in mysterious ways.

The monkeys and coconuts are of good quality and the plastic cups are sturdy as well. The cards on the other hand are very thin, you really need some good thick sleeves for them. The player boards are ok, would have been nice if they were somewhat thicker.

Players take turns flipping bouncy, rubber coconuts into a set of cups in the centre of the table.  If you land a coconut in a cup, you take the cup and place it on your mat.  To win the game, you need to build a pyramid of six cups, in 3/2/1 layers.  Cups can be taken from other players, and the special red cups grant an extra turn when taken.

Zany game, inexplicably addictive, and sort of hits the same area as Loopin' Louie.  Great fun.

When toys are turned into games, it doesn't always work, but this is a good example of it succeeding.   The rubbery cups and coconuts are just the right materials to allow the right kind of soft bouncing, which actually makes the game easier for kids.   The layout is pretty clever and the game plays just fine (maybe better) without the special action cards.   Fun stuff.

Dexterity/party/children games like this usually get a 6 rating for me, but I'm giving this one an extra point for how ridiculously fun I found it. 

You use a spring-loaded monkey paw to flip a rubber coconut (damn, do they look edible though) into someone else's cup which you then take away from them. The table will need to play defense on the leader at some point and he will suffer a hail of coconut bombs while trying to continue his offense. Then he'll get knocked down and someone else will rise up until some is able to put together a string of shots for the victory. It's silly fun.

„Agyeldobós-kókuszlövős-majomkodás”
A társasok között számomra érdekes helyet foglalnak el azok a gémek, amelyekben az ember ügyessége számít. Azt már tapasztaltam, hogy milyen népszerűen ezek a kisebbek körében és mennyire is tudják azt élvezni. Magam is próbát tettem már párral, de ezek közül eddig a „kókuszlövős majomparádé” tetszett a legjobban. Kifejezetten felüdítő ez-egy komolyabb „agyégető” társas után a gyermeki ént is szabadjára engedni. Több szót nem is érdemes rá vesztegetni, aki tudja, próbálja ki, megéri.

A perfectly entertaining little dexterity game. Adults always look horrified when I bring this out, and within a minute or two they are inevitably focusing intently on making their next shot. Very prone to a "awww, just ONE MORE round...?" reaction. But beware, those little coconuts (which are mysteriously, and somewhat disturbingly, rather sticky) bounce erratically all over the damn place and are magnets for dirt and pet hair.

You're flinging coconuts into cups. The coconuts look like chocolate, but don't eat them.

This is one of those games I categorize as "stupid fun".  It's just such a silly thing going on, but there's so much fun to be had, it makes for something pretty great.  It amazes me how once you think you've figured out the monkey launcher, it doesn't work how you thought it did on the next launch.  I also love how a coconut can bounce around and either jump into a cup, or in my case, out of the cup.  Lots of fun.  So glad I finally got around to giving this one a go.

Very fun family dexterity game.  I like how the coconuts sometimes bounce into or out of the cups, creating some entertaining and unexpected shots.  The cards add an extra element to mess with your opponents.  The monkeys, coconuts, and cups are good quality.  Hopefully the monkeys will last for a long time.  Cards are a little thin.  The box is flimsy and closes with a flap, not a lid.  I wish they hadn't cheaped out here.

The launchers are surprisingly sturdy and the game is just plain old fun. it is essentially group beer pong with a bouncy ball. The cards are maybe the worst cards I've seen in a game. They are total crap quality and one of them is a "lose a turn" card. The other ones are not much better and just have you targeting one player. Aside from the cards, this game is a blast.

Wacky family fun.  Who doesn't like catapulting coconuts and trying to get them into buckets?  Don't bother playing with the cards, the game is fun enough without them.  The monkey's are made solid and you do get the sense that there's a certain finesse required to shoot the coconut exactly where you want it.  The coconuts have a unique shape, they are not perfectly round, so it allows for some crazy shots as a coconut bounces off a table and takes a weird trajectory before landing in a cup that nobody thought it could get in.  Only drawback is having to chase wayward coconuts around as they go flying off the table.

It's basically balls and cups vs rings and spindles.  I think people just like monkeys better but I prefer not having to hunt for pieces so something like Ring-O Flamingo works better.  For actual catapult launching I prefer targets so Crossbows and Catapults or something like that.

Games like Coconuts tend to fail because the central gimmick (in Coconuts' case the coconut catapulting monkeys) rarely work well. Here the gimmick works perfectly, shooting is a perfect balance of skill and luck, and Coconuts takes it place alongside Looping Louie as a rare entry in the "this really should be a kids toy but actually it's a pretty fun game" -genre.

Another kid's game that I would place in the same group as Loopin' Louie.  This one is also fun as one uses monkey catapults to try and launch coconuts into cups...not always as easy as it may sound.

Coconuts is ridiculous fun for the whole family. I just happened to be walking by the Mayday Games booth at GenCon when someone was getting up in the middle of a demo and I was asked to sit in. Knowing the Looping Louie like buzz this game was receiving I sat down and starting fling some coconuts. The game is pure joy in plastic monkey form. Gameplay can be explained in about five sentences and you are off and running. The game can go a little long in the tooth if players are good at shooting the coconuts, but luckily the designer included a rule that eliminates a long protracted game, and also makes for an interesting alternative end of game scoring method. I highly recommend Coconuts to anyone who can get their hands on a copy because it is well worth the $30 MSRP most places have it listed as.

I would rename the game to poo flinger.  but coconuts sounds more kid friendly.

This was a surprise to me. Don't get me wrong, I always liked Coconuts. But it wasn't until I actually got my own copy and started experimenting with bucket starting placement and alcohol consumption that this jumped to the top of my dexterity game rankings*. Also, I love that the coconuts look like poo.

Great fun and the killer of Looping Louie/Chewie. Just great fun, though I think it's not that great with children as the coconuts would be missing soon...

Never since Alfredo's Food Fight have I had so much fun with catapults!

While the coconuts to look somewhat like poo, which would also been thematic, they're bouncy and lead to some outrageous turns of events.

It's silly fun, and if you like this sort of thing, buy it; it's exactly what you're expecting.

Why is this game so much fun? I honestly don't know. I think it's the cute monkeys and the oddly-shaped coconuts which offer plenty of opportunities for stunning trick shots and cheers as you constantly try and steal Gregg's cup full of coconuts. Screw you Gregg you're the worst quit stealing my cups!

This is probably more of an activity than a game, but either way it's FUN! Shooting the coconuts into cups is somehow more fun than playing beer pong, and certainly more kid-friendly. I've only played with 2 so far, so I can't imagine how much fun it is with 4. The coconuts and cups are EXCELLENT quality. Everything else is okay at best. Nevertheless, where it matters, this game has great production value. Love Coconuts!

Update 3/21/15: We named the monkeys a couple of nights ago with the CORE. Great mindless fun!

This is like the best childrens game ever. One of my favorites to play with non-gamer ADULTS too.
Fun game that anyone can learn in about 30 seconds. Really, FUN! That's how boardgames are supposed to be. Some of the cards are bit boring (+1 throw cards, zzzzz, really?), that's a huge missed chance to make every game feel more different so I feel like not giving full 10, but ok, 10 it is, it's easy to make cards on your own I guess. The components are good quality and it's simply FUN!

2-Player Comment:
*Very fun game with two as long as you're in the mood. The cards could be bit less swingy for two, but maybe it's not so important in game like this, and you can just play without them anyway. 

I gave it to my sons collection, which I won't traxk as owned

Game in a Nutshell: Catapult little rubber coconuts into cups using springloaded monkey arms.

Played as: 2,3,4 player

Pros: Accessable is an understatement. It's a game that demands to be played simply by looking at it. I've played cooperatively with my 1.5 year old daughter up to my 90 year old grandmother. Sweet package all the way around, complimentary art, sturdy components. Nice blend of skill and wackiness.

Cons: Chances are you'll spend as much time crawling around on the floor looking for errant cocnuts as playing the game. There's a little OCD part of me that this bothers (fortunately the game comes with a few extras). This could especially be an issue with small unwatched children or mouthy pets. There are some one-time-use cards in the box that are supposed to mix things up by making people take longer shots or blowing on thier shot as the take it, etc. I tried them once and found them to only detract from the overall simple but engrossing experience... so they get left out now.

Other: I'm pretty sure if you look at the game (especially being played) and know instantly if it's for you or not.

Best Use: I can't think of another game that has a wider potential audience then this (if they don't mind being the slightest bit silly).

As far as children's games go, very few come more highly rated than Coconuts.  I played the game with kids (7 and 9) and they found it instantly boring. This experience alone will make me think twice about bringing this one out again.  Having high expectations for a game that gets such positive feedback meant that the disappointment was that much worse.

The only things it's got going for it, are that the components are decent quality, the monkeys are aesthetically amusing and the game is quick to set up. It pales in comparison to how well Dr Eureka is received.

Felfoghatatlanul addiktív. Zseniális játék! Egyedül a majmok tartóssága aggaszt, mivel az egyik keze már lazul, illetve az összes maki kezéről lekopott a festék.

Coconuts is a straight forward dexterity game using plastic monkeys with sprung arms to flick coconuts over their heads and into cups.

This is silly dexterity fun in the same vein as Loopin' Louie and Toc Toc oodman (Click Clack Lumberjack). 

Here the players have to pull down a pair of monkey hands in order to fling coconuts (catapult style) into cup to win them and stack a cup pyramid. 

It really is a lot of fun but this is no Loopin' Louie, which for me is still the king of the dexterity castle. 

I do feel it is better than Toc Toc Woodman though as it is easier for kids to get a feel for the weight needed on the flinging monkeys and that maks the competition more even.

It's a fast dexterity game based on a popular drinking game quite confrontational where one good last action can win you the game. This feature maintains the interest alive until the very end, because everybody can win, but also makes the first two thirds of the game totally irrelevant.

There are some "take that" cards you can play, but this "add-on" seems quite artificial and does not improve the game.

[Children's Game] The slingshots are very tricky to control but I like the rubber coating on the ammunition; it makes the coconuts a lot less likely to disappear when landing.

The rules in the Scandinavian edition are quite bad. First, the cheap black-and-white presentation makes even figuring out the setup amazingly tricky. Second, the rules are written in a very loose mass-market style, and playing based on those may end up being very unsatisfactory. There is a lot more game in the mix once you browse the rules forum here to see how the game is actually supposed to be played.

God bless these dumb little dexterity games. I say dumb in an endearing, nostalgic way. I remember these types of time-wasters when I was eight, nine, ten; always with weird, plastic bits (worms, fishing poles, you name it) and this game reminds me how fun they were. Coconuts is so much fun and a great way to break up the heavy Euros. I love having this fun game among all the big games, just to show how variable and exotic games can truly be!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Have you seen the pictures of the game?  If so, you've probably got the idea...use a toy monkey to drop a coconut into a set of cups, first person to six cups ends the game.  Novel, but more of a toy than an actual game (despite the "gamey" addition of cards which grant either stupidly-overpowered or basically useless powers).  
Won't surprise you, but it can be fun in a Loopin' Louie kind of way, and with the expansion you can play 6-player (which I find a bit long and back-and-forth, but at least it can be done).  
Not going to set the gaming world on fire, but really is more of a toy than a game anyway, as mentioned.  Not really for kids, though, unless you want to find rubber coconuts all over your house for the next couple of weeks.  
Go with your gut on this one.  If your friends will play it more than a couple of times, it is likely worth the purchase.

Simple, stupid, dexterity game fun. A nice take on dexterity games, effectively manning a catapult and getting down a consistent angle and power. Fun!

However, we spend a quarter of our time shuffling under the table looking for game pieces launched astray, and ultimately it felt like the game dragged on. Maybe we just suck though!

Coconuts is just stupid fun. Though unbelievably I was taught it wrong! I was told the win condition was either building a pyramid or being first to run out of coconuts - rather than having most coconuts in your buckets when all the coconuts run out. The real rule seems much better as you can target buckets with multiple coconuts in them.

RATING: 7.5
The special power cards are iffy and the game can run a little long if players continually miss shots. But really, this is the most fun I've ever had with a spring-loaded monkey. The coconuts in particular are irregularly shaped and surprisingly springy, so they never quite fly in the way intended and can bounce out of (or into) cups when launched too hard.

Super cute and really fun.  I had a blast playing this with my grandson and he didn't want to quit!  The crazily bouncing coconuts jump in and out of cups and make for some really hilarious shots.  Plays quick and doesn't outstay its welcome.  We played without the wind cards.  Rated as a kids/family game and quick filler.  Update:  Tried this with the ladies at the assisted living facility and they had a blast!

This is a FUN dexterity game.  It's VERY well-produced (great components!) and plays very smoothly.  I didn't play with the special power cards and don't really think they're necessary at all.

1 play, 6er (with Duo expansion)

It's a cute dexterity game. There are a bunch of cups in the center. On your turn, use the cute monkey arms like a catapult, trying to flip the coconuts (they're not monkey poo. really. really?) into one of the cups. If you do, take the cup and stack it on your board. If you happen to catapult into someone else's stack, take that cup! 

Each player also has a special power card, usable once per game (e.g., take an extra fling, etc.). The game ends when someone collects a pyramid of cups (3-2-1) on their board. Then, count all the coconuts in your cups -- most nuts wins!

It's fun, but probably better with fewer players: doing this turn by turn was way too slow with 6 of us! It seems like it would have been better if each player had their own supply of nuts in their color, and everyone played simultaneously? Or maybe just play with 3 or 4 people?

A surprising entertaining little dexterity game. The monkeys are just inaccurate enough that you can't quite find a perfect range and hit every time, though I'm not honestly sure if that's a good or a bad thing. The scoring (which we managed to mess up!) makes it worthwhile, but I'm not sure where I'd play this - those coconuts are easy to lose so you really want to make sure you have the space to find them if they hit the floor.

Update: Just 5 plays in and this is really starting to show its limitations. Downtime becomes an issue as people retrieve their missed shots and it really takes a lot longer than it should.

The three-player game puts the board into an awkward configuration, as the game seems to be designed for four. You also want more people so that if someone takes an early lead, the other players can try to steal his cups and keep him from winning.

Only play this game on the floor, NOT on a table.  Other than that, there's no flaws in this game.  Play it in turns or as simultaneous as fast as you can for a frantic game.  This is actually a pretty good game to play while you chat with your friends as you can turn your brain off while playing.  Lots of "ooooh! Nice shot"

I bought this game intending to play it when we went on our family vacation to the beach this summer and it worked great while there. I played it a few times with my wife, nephew, his cousin, my sister, and even my two and a half year old son. It’s nothing serious and that’s fine, it’s a fun little activity as you shoot coconuts into the cups in a game that looks like it belongs at a carnival. Give it a shot, just don’t expect a ton.

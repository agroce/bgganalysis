GAME: Ausgebremst
RANK: 3515

RATING: 8
Much better than Ave Caesar. While AC is basically a luck-driven roll-and-move-race (with card draws instead of rolling dice), the four draw-piles in ausgebremst (and the deck-selection at the beginning) make this a clever tactical, even a little strategical game. And a very fun and tense game to play, as you can annoy your opponents all the time.
It has two constructional flaws, though:
1) Start positions have a great influence on your victory chances (we usually mitigate this with some house rules: http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/945248/two-variants-more-justice-and-more-strategy)
2) If the leading two cars decide to cooperate completely, it is hard to stop them from coming in 1st and 2nd.

Not as glossy as Ave Caesar, but the extra boards and the optional rules make this stand apart from it's better-looking cousin.  Recommended!

RATING: 9
Sensational racing game with a great mix of laughs, skill and the non players winning. Many combinations of board add game value, while the selection of cards for your car at the beginning of the game is novel, clever and works. Now a default game of choice for 45 minutes at the conclusion of an evening's gaming.

Enjoyable game. After reading all your opinions, guess I'd better go play Ave Caeser and compare.
(Just played Ave Caeser. I prefer the 'slightly' less randomness of Ausgebremst's three pile system)

RATING: 6.5
This game is based on / shares a common mechanic with Ave Caesar.  The difference is mostly theme, but I think this incarnation makes more sense.  The pit stop rules (err... Hail Caesar rule) in Ave Caesar makes no sense, but they sure do in car racing.  Game play in both is tactical and light which keeps the race moving along.  Plays well with larger numbers, but can start to drag a bit.

RATING: 6.5
Played the 1st two races.  Seems fun.  I think the average speed car is the best choice, but I was the pole-sitter & winner of both races so I might be biased and YMMV.  Definite similarities to Ave Caesar boardgame, but without the forced coin toss to Caesar (which I think is equivalent to a pit-stop) & with 3 double-sided puzzle boards that fit together in pairs to make about 6 different tracks for more gaming goodness.

One of the few game I still own from being a child until now.
It is ... well ... ohkay. I like the card-driven mechanic but that's it. For me the game has nothing more to offer what I don't get from Formula D (which I will always prefer over Ausgebremst - no matter what).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun racing game.  I do like the ability to tweak the way you are going to race: "Slow and Steady", "Normal", or "Pedal to the Metal"â€¦my terms, not theirs.  I replaced the cardboard standup cars with MicroMachines.  They work perfectly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The family game is fine, but I prefer the aesthetics of Ave Caesar.  The advanced game creates way more preparation work than I like.  I can see where it might appeal to those who dislike the randomness of the family game and want something more "serious", but for me the randomness is part of what makes the game enjoyable.  I rate the family game a 7 and the advanced game a 4.

I liked the approach to F1 but it's surprisingly tough to finish the race - accurate I suppose!

RATING: 5
Slightly less sucky version of Ave Caesar. Most decisions are blindingly obvious, so there isn't a lot going on here. The ability to choose different deck flavors does give it some texture which Ave Caesar lacks. You want to go first.

I was less offended by the presentation than most folks. It isn't awesome, but I didn't find it so terrible either.

Whoa, where did this come from? I almost dismissed the childish looking print and play of this being played at a convention. So glad I gave it a go because it was a game I just kept coming back to again and again during the convention. The advanced rules were terrific and having tune-able decks was pretty damn fun. Played 4-6 times and really enjoyed it. Like gaming popcorn.

Even more fun that Ave Caesar. Of course, like that game, having recently played games like Detroit/Cleveland will [i]completely[/i] miss the mark of the strategy. Some of tracks are absolutely brutal. In one of the races I was knocked out of contention on the first turn of the first lap! Still had a blast.

Same system as Ave Caesar, with some refinements like deck tuning.  Some say the tracks from Ave are better, and I wouldn't necessarily disagree; there needs to be more choke points.

RATING: 6
Remake of Ave Caesar where the rules where better but the components where worse.  It&#039;s a formula one racing game, where each player uses a deck of cards to get around the track.  Rules for tuning your deck to be a gearbox worked well, and there were 8 different track combinations from the three boards.  Underrated game, it just didn&#039;t look that good.

Ave Caesar's smarter but less affable sister.  Which one you prefer depends on what you're looking for in a game.  Ausgebremst allows for more nuanced play, but I question whether a game of this weight is worth the extra fuss - especially considering the extreme wretched hideous impossible-to-overstate ugliness of the Ausgebremst edition.

I loved Ave Ceasar back in the day, then I bought the Cafe Press edition and I found that the game as falling kinda flat whenever I brought it out. I suspected it was the looser/more forgiving boards in the Cafe Press edition, so I acquired Ausgebremst instead, and I've found that that game brings back the tension that I remember from the original edition of AC.

I think of Ave Caesar as a decent racing game with maybe a bit too big runaway leader problem. Ausgebremst fixes this somewhat and gives the players more options and tracks. Unfortunately, it looks so drab when compared to Ave Caesar, that I'd always prefer to play that to Ausgebremst. Why am I so shallow?

Very similar to Ave Caesar, but with some interesting advanced rules for breaking your draw deck into four piles (gears). Ausgebremst is a decent race game ... my lowoish rating in large part is reflects that this just isn't my favorite genre. If you're looking for a game where the lead changes hands, this isn't it. Ausgebremst is unforgiving, and those who plan poorly may not even finish the race. Race leaders are at a distinct advantage and are extremely difficult to catch and pass. It's a challenging game where the opportunities to make a move are scarce, which may appeal to some and turn others off. Probably best when using the the three double-sided boards to construct many different tracks and playing several races in succession, and the rules provide well for changing the start order and running multiple heats. I just don't have enough patience with race games to do that.

Probably slightly better than Ave Caesar because of the card selection, but the graphics are much worse.

Since this is largely an entry game for non-gamers, the graphics of Ave Caesar far outweigh the slightly better game play.

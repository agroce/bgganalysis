This is a 2-player spin-off of Animal Upon Animal, with a smaller number of animals (4 per player), that adds the speed of execution to the dexterity.
It is definitely less entertaining (my daughter can't compete in the speedy way required, and it has only 4 animals!), but it's a great addition for the base Animal Upon Animal if you play it with just 2 players: 11 animals per player can be very funny!!

Actually quite a neat little implemantation of the parent game.  I like this one quite a bit.  The speed element added to the dexterity makes quite a rollicking little two-player game.

I've only played this game a few times and it is ok, not great. Obviously it is meant for children and can't really be played against adults fairly. The main reason I got this was as an expansion to the original, which it works great. The rating reflects the game itself not using it as an expansion to Animal Upon Animal.

RATING: 4
A quick 2 player Animal upon Animal. Players rush to stack animals in certain pattern. Neat, but extremely short. Not sure how often I want to play this, as it doesn't have the appeal of a shared pile of animals.

5-10m, 2 players. 5+ plays.

Fun little stacking game that the kids really, really enjoy.

With only four animals the stacking possibilities will get exhausted pretty quickly.  The bigger version of this game has much more going on.

Ultimately when you've exhausted the fun here, this makes a nice expansion for two players for the bigger game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A quick dexterity game on it's own, but it also couples as an expansion to the original.  By itself Tier auf Tier: Das Duell is a non-descript stacking game where players role a dice to determine the staking order and race to see who can build their animal tower first.  It is lightning quick, and presents more of a challenge than first thought.  

As a solo game, I probably wouldn't purchase it, but the fact that I can add these little animals (especially the octopus) to the parent game makes it a must own.  Tier auf Tier is my favorite stacking game, adding to it is a wonderful thing.

Rating is for Solo game.

Speed and constraints make this a Tief Auf Tier unlike any other, and more to my taste. Having only four animals does limit replayability.

Rating for two copies merged with the original = 7

17-Aug-2014 - BTW we did get a second copy and put all the animals into the Tier auf Tier box, it makes it evil fun.  Highly recommended - [b]two[/b] copies of this with the original Tier auf Tier

[LUP 03-Sep-2009] There is just not enough in this to be worth while compared to the original Tier auf Tier.  It is very cheap though (at least in Germany) so we are intending to get a second set and then add the components of both sets to our original Tier auf Tier to make [b]Tier auf Tier: The Deluxe edition[/b] ;)

RATING: 6.8
「ワニに乗る」だけで十分楽しいのだが、このゲームは別の楽しみ方を教えてくれた。4歳から6歳までの積み方を見ていると子供の成長が見れて面白い。ワニに乗るの駒は、いかだ動物園の駒より厚いので、積むのは子供でも楽。いかだ動物園の駒で同じことをするとかなり大変と初見思う。でも、プレイしてみると意外といかだ動物園の駒でも代用がきくことが分かる。拡張として動物の追加を中途半端(2つずつ）にした点はマイナスだ。家族でプレイすることをHabaはこだわらなかったのだろうか？
子供と良くプレイする良いゲームだが、ほとんど流通していないのが欠点。

Quick dexterity game for two.  The non gaming s.o. plays it.

RATING: 6
Quite different from the original Ter auf Tier. Each of the two players builds his own pyramid of animals by stacking them on top of each other. The game starts with throwing the dice which show which animal should go first (be at the bottom) and which should go last (be at the very top). Then the clock starts and the goal is to build the stack as fast as possible (both players are building the same stack). Since there are only four animals such round takes only a short while, so to make it a bit longer it is suggested to play in the best-of-five series.

At first I was quite dissapointed with this idea, the "new" game was very fast, too fast for my liking. But after a few games I started to like it, and you will probably too, if you forget about expecting an expansion to Tier auf Tier. It's fun, but a different kind of fun, where you replace careful planning with superfast and competetive stacking.

My kids initial reaction was great, they love animals, they love Tier auf Tier, they immediately wanted to play this game. But they were also dissapointed that we can't play this game with 3 players as well as that we can't really mix new animals with old animals (in a 3-player game). The stacking of these foour animals provided quite a challenge for them, but after several tries they got it and played better and better. As expected, the octopus caused most problems. Despite it, Iga managed to win a game with my dad the next day, without any handicap.

I'm still a bit dissapointed with this game, mostly with the mentioned inability to mix it with Tier auf Tier in a 3- or 4-player environment. But if you forget about it (or do not have the base game) it's a lot of fun and definitely a nice filler suited for everyone >3 years.

Plays in only a few minutes. Wife loves it. What's not to like. Great to bring to parties, make the winner drink and play again. Multiple copies are good too and it is a cheep game so its not a big deal to buy a second copy to ad another 2 players.

RATING: 4
Fast fillergame. You have to stack four animals and determine with a dice which animal should come on bottom and on top. You can also mix these animals with the original tier auf tier (I tried and it works) for a more fun of the original kind. But in the box there are only animals for two players so if this is what you want, you should buy two boxes.

The original game functions pretty well as a 2-player, so why play this? It's just OK, but since you're only busy building you own stack, there's no taunting and cheering the other players. The best use for this game is to use the pieces in the standard game (in which case you need two copies, of course).

A super fast race variant of Animal upon Animal for 2 players. I'm yet to add them in to the base game for added variety, but I'm sure it's only a matter of time...

I picked up two of these to add to the original game.  I like the figures.  The goose is especially difficult.  As an expansion to Animal Upon Animal I am very happy (though the cost was a little high).

As a game in itself it's pretty fun as well if you are looking for a quick animal stacking fix.

This is a highly enjoyable, and silly dexterity game on speed. Of course we own two sets in order to be able to add all the animals to our regular of Tier auf Tier collection, which at the time of this update is up to 23 different animal pieces.

Tier auf Tier: Das Duell is a very quick playing game, you whip through an entire best-of-five game in a couple of minutes. While it's fun, the replay value would be greatly improved if HABA would simply release new dice for this, with some of the animals from the other Tier auf Tier sets. I'd buy such dice sets at first opportunity, and as long as they kept releasing them.

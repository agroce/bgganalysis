RATING: 7
We have a family copy, bought in the late 80s, and initially we found it essentially impossible to win as the defending side (with the king) if the other player played well. But after playing it many more times, the situation was completely reversed and we found it nigh impossible to win as the attacking side. It has since lived in a cupboard for a long time; we recently came across it and discovered we had regressed to being complete novices. It's certainly more abstract than the other games in our collection, but I'd quite like to keep playing it on occasion.

RATING: 10
Very advanced strategy is involved once you get the hang of it. The sides aren't balanced perfectly, but when played with the "fetlar" rule set, it's pretty darn close. The strategy for black (non-king side) is harder to realize at first, and this will be frustrating for many beginners. (But stick with it!)

This is my favorite board game ever.

The "best" set of rules in my opinion is the "Fetlar" rule set. (Google it) Smaller boards are more unbalanced and less fun. (Like the 7x7 and 9x9 variants) (IMO) 11x11 is the largest I've played. Maybe an even larger board is even better? I'll have to try 13x13 next.

I made my own board with plywood when I decided that I really liked the game. 

It's really an awesome game. You just need to get into a mindset/strategy that's uncommon in most modern board games.

Very unusual.  Played this in Germany against a German maths lecturer (who doesn't like German games!)  Not unsurprisingly, he beat me several times.  Nevertheless, I enjoyed it and the fact that playing the two sides is a very different experience.  My version is called the "Viking Game."

Love this game! Assuming you have a big enough board and enough pieces, it's easy to scale down to a quick skirmish (Tablut), and scale up to a huge war (Alea Evangelii). 

I see the rule variations as a method of handicapping: the weak player can pose a real challenge if allowed to play the defenders using an armed king, who must be surrounded on four sides, and needs only to reach the edge to win.

I got this game when I was 10 and played it some with my brothers and parents. However, we deemed it too unbalanced to be enjoyable so after the initial months it did not see much play and what may still be left of my game copy has been collecting dust for several decades. Possibly more experience or some tweaking of the rules could make for a better game, as there are suggestions in that direction on this forum. We played by the rules provided by Alga in their edition from the seventies or eighties.

I imagine myself sitting on deck of a longship with an old oak board balanced across my own lap and that bastard, Nordavil's. Seeing his hand slide an extra piece I shout out at him, calling him a sneak and horse thief. He shouts back insulting my bloodline claiming it caused damage to my head, and that it was the seas turning causing the piece to move. I knock the table from the tops of our legs, grabbing my axe and split his skull open in one fluid motion. I win.

Great abstract game. Feels timeless. Game pieces are unforgettable, and the strategy is subtle. This is also one of the very few asymmetrical abstract games out there, which is surprising, given its ancient origins.

I do recommend finding rules variations online, and playing enough to tweak your ruleset according to your tastes. It seems that many people are in disagreement over exactly how to play, and the rules that came with my set feature some questionable mechanics.

I'm very ambivalent about this game. The game might have issues, most notably that it might invite to draws, but I haven't been able to find any sources which offer conclusive answers. What complicate matters is that there are different sets of rules, and I'm not sure which one's the best. In any case, I thoroughly enjoy the asymmetric and unusual gameplay, so I don't hesitate giving it a high grade despite my doubts.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Great strategic game. Like chess but historically much older. All pieces move like the rook and you capture a piece by positioning your pieces on opposing flanking sides. In a move called a "anvil and hammer"

Is a little unbalanced in that the kings side usually wins more. The king is a rather powerful piece.
There are some variants in advanced play that level and balance the game for both sides. And Balance the King. There is also different ways to set up the board and different ways to play. One game that has great replay value.

A great game for strategic thinkers and people who love games like chess.

Hnefatafl is an asymmetrical strategy game.  One player tries to move the king from the centre of the board to one of the four corners while the other, more numerous player, tries to stop them.  It's a simple game, but a pleasant change from other classic/ancient strategy games like chess, go, or checkers.

CLASSIC GAME!

Main Positives: I'm really fascinated with the historical connections of the game. 

Fun Factor: Very Low
Complexity: Not very high
Replayability: I want to play this game with someone who holds no punches.

Main Frustrations and Caveats:
Unfortunately, it came out to be a terrible game in terms of time. There are many times when pieces would go back and forth around the board and players might not realize how many times they went back to a certain situation in the board. A TIMED GAME is way better to play this game.

Hnefatafl seems like a solid balanced asymetric 2p abstract. The theme is a lot stronger than many abstracts though with the scenario clearly that the remnant of a kings fighting forces are surrounded by an outnumbering opposing army. The Kings army wins if the King escapes and the surrounding army wins if he is killed/captured.

This rating may drop like a rock if the game turns out to be unbalanced or worse yet solvable but I'll enjoy playing it until that seems to be the case.

I played this game at the children's corner of a museum in Jelling, Denmark, and both me and my girlfriend were quite surprised at its fiendish gameplay which is a lot deeper than you would think at first. The movement and capturing rules are simple and elegant, while the game it short enough to demand a rematch. We were tempted to buy the edition on sale at the museum, but the high price made us believe we'd be able to pick up a cheaper copy elsewhere. Alas, 't was not to be... Eventually, I bought a copy off eBay, and played more. 

There seems to be an imbalance in the strength of the pieces, but this is very likely caused by unfamiliarity and difference in player level. It is a somewhat fun excercise in cornering and blocking off paths, but I discovered that a single mistake can cause an unexpected victory. In other words, the game requires you to be on your toes all the time. This is definitely a good trait. Yet despite this, the game seems to be lacking appeal. It's a classical abstract you would do well to try at least once, but I'm afraid it just didn't click with me.

Interesting for a cosy evenings competition against a friend along with a nice bottle (or two) of wine.  This is a game with many limitations, so don't think it compares at all with chess, but played for what it is it serves as light entertainment. Many interesting variations to try though, and easy to make your own set(s). This comes from a simpler time of log fires in the hall amid cold dark Nordic and Saxon nights. Play it with this in mind. And did I mention it gets much better after the second bottle of wine.....

I own an Australian variant of this game which goes by the name "The Game Ned Kelly." This has some new rules that help to balance the original game.

One of the things that make this game interesting is that you have to watch all parts of the board all the time as a move on one part of the board can have a big impact on the situation on another part of the board. 

I also enjoy the fact that you have to play the game quite differently depending on which side you are playing. There is quite a bit of hidden depth to the game.

RATING: 6
Assymetrical abstract game, where one player is trapped with a minority of pieces in the centre of the board, along with their King piece.  The attacking player sets up around the perimeter of the defender with twice as many pieces.  The object for the attacker is to trap the King on all four sides, while the King has to reach one of the four corner squares of the board.  All pieces move in "rook" fashion, and are captured when surrounded on opposite sides.  Fascinating game.

A game that I find interesting because of the Viking history behind it, and the version I have has the most lovely carved Viking pieces. It was a gift to my husband and he likes it so we are keeping it, but I am bad at (and have no interest in) Chess like games and this one seems particularly unbalanced to me. White always seems to win and that is even when *I* play white! Games seem to be very quick (over in 5 minutes) so I am not sure that this very obscure game has not had something lost in translation for the rules. Same situation applies when I play online or app versions. Not something I am ever itching to play.

"Viking chess"

Asymmetric Viking chess, sound cool right? I'm not sure if this game is balanced. When both players are beginners, white will have the upper hand. For advanced  players, black seems to have an advantage. Maybe it's balanced for really good players, who knows? It's a good game to play instead of chess or checkers and even though the rules are quite simple, there is a lot of strategic depth.

It's been many years since I've played. It still gives me the feeling of being a decent abstract for its time, but ultimately it heavily favours the king's side. It has a few neat elements though that make it a rather important game historically. The unequal sides; the "wargame" theme-ing of an abstract; the "sandwich" attack. These all are important elements to the history of abstracts. There are several variations in the tafl family of games and I will assume there is one that balances the game a bit better.

Hugely enjoyable game where, for once, the old "minute to learn, lifetime to master" adage is not inaccurate.  The rules, as published in the popular History Craft version are certainly playable, but very biased towards the defending side. The best and most playable variation I have found is to restrict the king to a move of 3 squares, allow him to be captured in the same way as any other piece and to designate the escape squares and throne square as hostile i.e. a piece may be captured by sandwiching against one of these squares.

RATING: 6.5
In the chess realm- quite similar in it's abstract qualities & appearance, but very different in play style and strategy (worlds different & far simpler). The asymetrical forces are what make this so interesting and somewhat unique. Worth having & keeping around if only for it's uniqueness and unusual aspects. A good picnic abstract game.

One of my favorite abstract games. I love how ancient it feels, but it's a shame no one really knows exactly how the vikings played it originally.

Played as Tablut on BS

Another cool tricky little abstract.  Of course I have to compare all abstracts to the Gipf series and this just doesn’t have the same kind of depth but its pretty nifty all the same.  Not sure I like the draw rules but I have not played very many games thus far.   

Update:  Alright I officially hate this game, yes that means I cant win (as gold).  Hmm it’s a pure game of mistakes here just like chess, lots of back and forth in the waiting.  

Update:  Holy shit, okay the significant depth isn’t really there BUT it took me about 10 games to beat the damn AI on BS, so it is trickier than it looks!

Interesting game, but (unless I'm mising something) pretty unbalanced - it just takes one non-optimal slip from the edge team to allow the king to escape, at least with the rules the game comes packaged with. (They're honest enough to admit that no Viking rules have passed down through the ages, just the game equipment. Not that many Vikings would have written down the rules, I guess...)

Brilliant asymmetrical abstract game.  I have  played this in the "Tablut" version on boardspace.net and have also tried it live  I enjoy the breakout vs. enclosure dynamic and (unlike some abstracts) the goals seem to me to be evident though hard to achieve.  I am not sure which ruleset yields the best gameplay though.

An easy to learn game that shares most abstract's quality of high depth to learning curve ratio. I love the asymmetry of the game, although it is recommended for each player to play both sides and compare to see who took fewer turns to escape, since for experienced players it is very hard to kill the king. This game seems especially unforgiving to mistakes, as one wrong move and the king can break free of your web/your king is trapped in a torturous path.

I really like this game, not only because it's viking 'themed'. Quite smart and demanding, also quite tense. Too bad it tends to end 'one move too early' (the defender places the Chieftain in a position which the attacker cannot block, so his last move is pretty much pointless).

RATING: 7
When one of my regular lunchtime gaming opponents brought this out we both really liked it and started to try out different strategies. Early plays ended up with the attackers, despite outnumbering the defenders by a fairly significant margin, losing every game. After all, the defender's sole objective is to have their king escape and it doesn't matter how many pawns they lose doing it. It's much harder for the attackers who have to be able to box the king in on four sides.

This did not dissuade us and, if anything, just made us eager to explore other options and different strategies. In the last game we played the attacker methodically blocked each corner exit and then we set about a cat-and-mouse exercise in attempting to either kill enough attackers to force a break in the defence pattern or kill enough defenders to give the remaining attackers a chance at boxing in the king.

This took a while. A long while and, for mine (playing as defender) the game really started to drag.

We were interrupted by a fire drill (yes, really) and haven't gone back to the game since.

I'm sure we'll play again, but the strategy of denial really slowed up the game and made a fun 15 minute exercise into something of an odyssey of tedium.

Following the rules that are taken for standard nowadays, Hnefatafl (as all the other games in the Tafl family, really) is a rather beautiful classical game, as clean as it can be (pieces move straight and capture by interception, the king has got to reach one of the four corners) but containing two conflictive aspects: it's strongly asymmetrical and there's nothing to stop stalemates so that the game can get blocked anytime. Anyway, if played with sportsmanship Hnefatafl can be a delicious experience.

Somewhat unbalanced and boring game. Many of the strategies are non-intuitive due to oddities with how the game pieces work. Also, too time-consuming considering you need to switch places and play a second round in order for it to be a fair full match.

The play count to the left is a mistake; I've played this a number of times.

I've had some amazing wars with my girlfriend and look forward to sharing this game with friends. This game defiantly needs to be experienced! Fight to kill the King by "sandwiching" your enemies, or switch sides and try to get your King off the battlefield to safety. Easily one of my new top 10 games!! Hnefatafl is also know as Talf, Kings Table, and The Viking Game. Check it out!! I think you'll love it!

A great little game.  I have the 'The Viking Game' version by History Craft Ltd, so I love the gorgeous little moulded plastic pieces, and the themed-look cloth board.  [A treat to look at and handle.]  But I also really like the fact that you have to play the 2 sides differently - one side has less pieces and their goal is to have the King escape, the other side has more pieces and they have to block escape routes (and surround the King if possible).  You can capture pieces by sandwiching (or surrounding) them, but capturing is no good for its own sake - you should only do so when it is part of the relevant strategy.  [Otherwise you might take a piece or two, only to lose the game in a move or two!].  Very simple to learn and quite quick to play, but the different objectives and strategies allow variety and interest.  A little like Chess in terms of moves, but much less complicated than Chess can become, and, to my mind, it is more interesting and atmospheric.  I love it.  [My wife doesn't though.  But then again, I dislike Chess ...]

This is my favourite game.  The tantalising remains in archaeology and history, just short of what we need for a true reconstruction, add for me an air of mystery to the game.  The variety of original variations, and the greater variety of good modern reconstructions, provide a wide range of strategic possibilities.  There's much more to be researched on this game, so it's rewarding to the player and the scholar alike.  I'm obsessed.

A nice little game but obviously the theme is very dry and there is just something missing......an OK game but so many games so little time. This will probably get shelved.

Classic game of vikings, that is based on Ludus Luntrunculum and maybe Seega. You can play this online and experiment with the myriad of game conditions you can choose from, e.g. initial piece layout, can you move over the center square, can you capture on the sides. Some of these variants are solvable, others not so sure. 

 Worthy of study for the sandwich capture as well as asymmetric sides.  User: Moshe Callahan has some interesting essays on the study of these games, see Pettia which describes the family I think.

If you embark down the tafl road I recommend you use the improved rules by Alex Damian which are found here on the Geek. Playing with those rules makes this a quite enjoyable challenge. Will definetly hit the table again.

An interesting chess-like game but with one player being the attacker and the other the King (both having different objectives). It is an interesting exercise in the history of gaming, but I suspect with experienced players would stalemate a lot more often.

I just love it, simple in design but very deep. I have my game bought from the Viking Museum at York. Very good quality pieces and a cloth board that makes really easy to take it anywhere!

The asymmetrical siege tactics and historical flavor of the game fascinates me. Either player can very easily force a draw, at least on the larger boards, but advocates actually find this a feature! I need to play more, but I think the drawish nature of the game is avoided on the smallish and extra large boards where it is difficult to control an area due either to a lack of men, or an overabundance of space.

Generally I don't like abstract strategies, but as far as these games go, this is one of the best. Unequal sides give this game a lot more replayability value than usual - definitely need more plays.

An ancient Scandinavian board game, this is a moderately-fun game that seems, at first glance at least, to have balance issues. It's not something I'd bother learning in-depth strategies for, but it can be enjoyable to play on occasion. However there are other two-player games I vastly prefer.

Bought mostly for its historical value.  I suspect the Vikings saw the value in using it to teach the value of the shield wall.  There are tactics that can bring this game to a stalemate each time.  The copies I bought in England had very nice components.

In chess, both sides are attacking and defending at the same time. In this game, one is attacking and the other side wants to gets the king to escape to the any of the corners. Every piece moves like a rook and you capture a piece when you have two pieces on adjacent squares of their piece.

RATING: 8
A neat little abstract strategy game.  I guess I like it for the simple reason that I've always been lousy at Chess, but seem to do pretty well with this, regardless of whether I'm playing the attackers or defenders.  I have two versions, each with slightly different boards, and a slightly different number of pieces.  But the rules and object of both versions are essentially the same.

RATING: 5
Classic game of abstract strategy.  Quite fascinating.  Too bad this one hasn't reached quite the market saturation of [gameid=2083], [gameid=171], and even [gameid=2448], because I really like this one.  The different goals and uneven sides makes this a real interesting play, but unfortunately mean that match play is necessary for a fair game.  The strategy is not so intuitive at first glance, which means that repeated play is a necessity in order to learn it well.

Played many years ago with a friend's copy. Finally got my own copy on Ebay in April 2012. Have only played it a few times since, and found it surprisingly complex, despite the simplicity of the rules! 

There are interesting choices and careful strategic planning. Different versions of the rules abound, which can be confusing. For now I'm sticking with the rules printed in this version, but would like to try the "World Championship" rules.

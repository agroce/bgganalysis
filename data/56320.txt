It feels like a cross between a really beefed up [thing=32484][/thing] and [thing=42898]Pocket Battles[/thing].  The graphics look great and the game is easy to play and a solid filler.  I wish it were more historical, but that is my personal preference.

Update: No Vassal module.  Couldn't find opponents.  Traded.

Decisions seem a bit obvious, but perhaps I'm not good enough to make better decisions yet. There will certainly be some skill in deck selection, but I'm still using suggested starter decks, since we've only played a couple of times.

Winner gets stronger. A very basic card game that is quite dependent on the dice roll. The idea to allow deployment of A and B before anything can be done is a question that is prominent throughout the whole game.

The dice can really do a number on your play. Maybe it is realistic, but it is also obnoxious. Still, would play it again without qualms.

Spear point 1943 is a dice rolling war card game where you build your deck with units at the start of the game and are trying to kill the enemy units for their value to reach a victory point total. Decent game w/ my criticisms being in the targeting phase and we felt the dice could have been consolidated for easier play. It's heavy on dice rolling, & luck is a strong-ish factor. Have a set of d20 laying around to keep track of life of units, otherwise you're gonna be using paper. Not a bad game and building your deck is important. It has a small form factor which makes it easy to transport. And the cards are nice.

Quite a lot of fun in just 30 minutes.
So far I've only played premade decks (which have been great) but I see where the ability to build a custom deck could really let this game shine.

SP43 will be played as a fun game. Lots of little decisions to go along with the abundant dice-rolling. Basic game is balanced, although some command cards seem awfully powerful. Scenarios add flavor. Damage cards are very well done. Many of the unit cards are similar in their abilities. 

There isn't much to do tactically but the carnage is plentiful; few units survive for very long, and the excitement/fun level is pretty good. A one-sided game can turn around very quickly.

Each standard game usually has a little story afterwards, like the time I was comfortably ahead and a lucky bazooka hit killed my Panther before I could get off a shot, and turned things completely around. If only my damn FW-190 had gotten out of its hangar sooner....

Overall, a nice, basic WW2 game-- for the whole family.

This game is fantastic.  It plays quick, but is certainly deep enough to be a fulfilling gaming experience.  Works as a light game for non-gamers (it's not terribly complex), but has enough there to let even gamers get some serious enjoyment out of it.  Pre-ordered after one play, so clearly thought it was worth playing more!

This is an excellent, card-based, light wargame.  Hits our hot buttons because of the WWII theme.

Lots of dice rolling, which is fun, although the luck factor can often undermine a good strategic play or turn. 

I'm not sure how balanced the two sides are.  In our experience, the US usually loses to the Germans.   Of course it could just be that I suck at this game, and I always play the US.

I played this game three times at Origins and it just was not fun for me, it was more than a little unbalanced and did not "feel" like a real WWII battle. In one my first draw I got a plane card but had to wait four turns for the crew card to show up meanwhile my enemy had a bomber and pilot in the first turn and blew the hell out of my forces while I could only watch. Unfortunately that was only one of the many problems. Let's not even talk about the poor card design, the annoying complexity, or the badly designed friendly fire rules.

Picked this up at Historicon 2014 after playing a few rounds with the game's creator, Bryon Collins. It is an interesting WWII tactical-ish card game that features deck building. I enjoyed it because both players are constantly presented with significant decisions and the outcomes of the game manage to maintain a sense of historical verity. I am truly holding out for the Eastern Front edition.

RATING: 7
Fun wargame, ideal for starting the game evening or during lunch. Not hard to explain since the rules aren't that difficult.  

I advise that, before playing, you first read through the rules section here on BGG. A lot will be clearer then.

This game might be to light for a hardcore wargamer but offers a lot of variety and fun for all the rest of us. Replayability is high thanks to the fact that you can make different decks and the creator made several scenarios.

People really need to stop expecting this to be a DEEP, COMPLEX, RULES HEAVY game!  

It's a lite war-game.  It doesn't claim to be anything more.  It is EXACTLY what the designer says it is.  If your expectations were for something else then it is your own fault for not reading about the game.  

It's not a bad game simply because YOU expected something else!

Combat required you roll => then a target # with 2d10.  Makes for very random results, which is good, except when one player is very lucky and the other unlucky.

Only played one game, where the US rolled nothing under 12 for his first five rolls, decimating the German units and scoring 32+ points.  Germans were unable to hit, even with a to hit number of 9 (rolled 8) until late in the game.

Mechanically the game is OK, although some rules are not clear; case in point, the rulebook has 3 pages of rules and a page of diagrams, and there is a 6 page FAQ...

Cards are good quality and iconography is easy to follow.

Dislikes (apart from random combat):

Sleeved cards will not fit in the original box.

US has mobile artillery (M3 Priest) Germans have none...  Find the game unbalanced, advantaging the US.

Simultaneous target selection and commitment of units were sticking points with my opponent, but it didn't impact any of my decisions (either I was going to place a unit or I wasn't, same with target selection, so mechanically this should be fine).

Some interesting ideas in how the decks are constructed (infantry can always be played, but vehicles, artillery and airplanes all require their own particular crew), but in play I found it too straightforward and simple.  Focus fire, rinse and repeat.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
It looks like deck construction will be key to this game. The nice part is that both sides are known (you have an idea of what your opponent can use to build their deck). Due to the luck of the draw, a combined arms deck might be at a disadvantage due to the need to match up the correct crew type with the correct unit type in some cases, thereby increasing the odds you won't always have the cards you need to get things out quickly. Looking forward to more plays!

Fantastic game, and a very good introduction to WWII gaming for my ten year old son. We have knocked out games before he goes to school and this is one he regularly picks for evening gaming, so much so that I am going to get another copy, or two. He'll have his forces figured out before I get to the table. Can play on almost any surface, which is a huge plus. This one goes with us on every trip.

Like the theme, nice cards, the mechanics are okay, but the decks can be uneven and with the random luck of the draw could leave you with few options. Need to play with the scenarios. Definitely plays better with the scenarios. Still a quick, fun WWII themed tactical card game. Take it to the pub.

Cool idea, but some of the mechanics don't work as well as one might hope.  Big points on coolness and some neat ideas (enjoy being able to build decks and some of the other features) but things just don't quite seem to come together leaving it feel like it has unrealized potential.

RATING: 5
Getting interest high with cards on tactical level simulation instead of the brain cell-letting ASL....It turns out to be a good time-filler but no match in the face of the depth of Up Front. But then I was expecting too much perhaps.  The card deck reflects the assets available to the American and German in 1943. One of the better feature of the game is that players are free to compose the units into their own "reserve deck", thus allowing flexibility in designing your own units which are supposed to be in your participating platoon (or something similar to that scale), containing 100 victory points each. It proves that a good composition of the units would be the first step to your success (more on that later).   

You commit the units onto the table into "frontline" or "rear line", imaginary positions on the table and start the combat by pointing the units to their declared target. This can become a matter of confusion as more units are committed to combat with both sides targeting different units. Both players then roll an initiative dieroll and the higher one can determine who should go attack first. A hit is determined by rolling two dices equal to or greater than the weapon's attack value. If it hits, another "Intensity" dieroll is made and damage is done when the Intensity dieroll plus the Damage Index of the weapon in use is greater than the target's defense value.  All foot units have a defense value of 0, unless modified by Command card like "Dig-in". A unit can fire two weapons in a single attack.  An air can only drop a bomb only once in a turn and it has to go back to the reserve deck as confined by its "Turns of Flight", reflecting the fuel limiting factor of airpower. 

In my first game, to illustrate how important the composition of reserve deck is, the American won by kept dropping bombs onto my Tiger and Pather while the yankees withdrew to the rear line unharmed. My formation didn't contain any anti-aircraft guns and that means I could never attack the American air force. My only one air unit was shot down early on by my opponent's lucky dieroll. While the American infantry total victory points were less than 51, the only way the German could win is by overrun - keeping the area free of enemy land units for three consecutive turns. The game bogged down to the Germans as the yankees avoided fighting on the ground by committing one unit at a time as long as avoiding being overrun.      
    
The rules are short and hence you cannot expect them to be comprehensive as any other wargame.  I feel there are some ambiguities at times during gameplay and even going back to the rules can't help resolve them.  You have to make an educated guess.  For example, a dieroll of 0 should be "10", which can only be deduced from the possible critical hit of a sum of dieroll 20. An attack or defense bonus of one on the Command card is not explained as to whether it refers to lower one to the weapon attack value (meaning higher chance to hit) or to the dieroll result.  Only that is clarified by the designer the answer to be the former. A disappointing rules writing.

The system might not be as clunky as the use of the terms but the rules are.  When the rule/ card says +1 to the Attack, it refers to +1 to the dieroll result. When it says Intensity Roll, it just refers to the one die (D10) you roll for determining whether there is on hit on the enemy. And that "intensity" can be doubled when there is a Special Attack Roll with 2D10. When the rule talks about Damage Index, it simply refers to the number on the card with which weapon is fired being added to the Attack Roll to determine Raw Damage. Net Damage is calculated by subtracting Defense (value) of the target unit. If Net Damage reduces the Endurance to less than its half, a Damage card is drawn and attached to the target for Damage effect. 

Man, a glossary of terms should be prepared for use in the rules, while they are condensed into just four pages of rules.

Overall, the abstractedness is abundant in the design, delivering many wargaming concepts like friendly fire, critical hit or double intensity with simple attack rolls. Simple as it is intended to be, the base game yawns for more specific scenarios (called as "situations" by the designer) that come with alternative victory conditions, i.e. other than the free-form first race to the finish line of 51 victory points of units being destroyed. You have to download them separately from the game website. I haven't tried them and they probably would help upgrade the rating by one. Coupling the rate of fire of each weapon carried by a unit, the number of dice rollings is a bit too much to my taste and renders the game more of luck than strategy.  Despite the lack of depth of the gameplay like that of Up Front, and much less ferocity of Frontline: D-Day, I still have preordered the Eastern Front expansion, hoping to add further varieties to the base game.

Light card-based wargame.  Luck of draw can sometimes lead to quick game endings.  Challenging for newer players to build a competitive deck.  Offers a variety of choices each turn.  Desirous of more strategic gameplay options, and less abstraction.

Would be willing to play again.  No chance of future re-acquisition.

Fun.  Best WWII-combat-on-cards thing I've played.   Does lack the "illusion of movement", but what it lacks in maneuver it makes up for in deadly fire decisions associated with targeting.  Combat resolution has a few layers for next to no rules overhead, and makes sense.  I want more units and nationalities, always a good sign.

Fast and easy WWII battle card game. Build your deck and fight. It does involve some dice rolling and bad luck happen.

*** Drop the rating to 7 due to German Tiger tank screw up the balance of the game after several plays. Basically, German player has better chance to win with the tiger in play. I will introduce my house rule about the tiger stat to balance it back.

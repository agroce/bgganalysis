(KIDS) It's basically a cute game of addition.  The game part is fairly random in terms of who wins, but kids seem to enjoy the back and forth of Zeus changing hands and the powers of the gods.  While I tend not to be a fan of games which are so straightforwardly just about doing schoolwork (e.g. Addition), this one actually does a nice job of disguising it with other things that keep kids interested.

I've rated this a 4 since the game value is very low.  It is nice for addition and my son loves it with the back and forth.  It's mostly just who gets lucky at the end and player decisions have little impact on the the winner.

Another decent filler game from Gamewright.  Not much to it but it is quick and only requires some minor thinking which I believe is the definition of a filler game.  All about playing the right cards to get olympus to 100 while having zeus under your control.

RATING: 9.5
my one complaint for this game is that it can last a few minutes or well over an hour, but it plays quick -you're always engaged, it's easy to learn, portable, no set up, people can easily drop in or out in between rounds so besides the unreliable time to finish it makes a great game to just have on hand and play anywhere, anytime with just about anyone.

A nice little game for young kids learning addition that ranges from 1-100. A few abstract concepts like reversing values (eg. 41--->14), but we found it worked well with our daughter at the time, especially when we made a number chart so she could follow along. Bonus: Some basic info about the Greek pantheon!

Purchased new at Cool Stuff Inc. 5/29/10

Initial 3-player game with 9-year old daughter.  We split the rounds at 1 and then 2 apiece.  Daughter won her 3rd round and we declared the game.  

An interesting and chaotic children's game that my daughter REALLY enjoyed.  After 2 rounds she was adding in her head, so the educational aspect really works!!  She loves the Zeus figure and wouldn't let go of him when she owned him.  So cute!!

Good for kids, I found it repetitive and crazy--no surprise there.  

My rating would be a 5.5; my daughter's would be a 7.  So, I'll give it her rating as I was really happy that she liked the game, wanted to keep playing, and was actually adding number in her head!!

UPDATE: Played at my daughter's school with full complement of 5 players.  Way crazy and chaotic. The children LOVED it!!  Their math skills were not all that great for the game, but they really enjoyed it!!

Great game for children!!

Feather light, fast, and pleasantly math-y with my 7-year-old. I first thought the game was almost broken, it seemed so lacking in decision-making. But with more plays, it turns out there's a little more to pay attention to, if only to try to count cards. For a fun, easy way to practice simple math, this does the trick.

RATING: 8
In terms of gameplay, this deserves MAYBE a 5.  But I gave it an 8 because there's more here... There aren't many bits in this game (deck of cards, one plastic yellow Zeus figurine), but they are outstanding.  The illustrations on the cards are captivating, and the Zeus figure makes the game.  There's a plus 1 rating point right there.  The Zeus figure gets stolen (that's how it's phrased in the game!), and the yanking Zeus out from in front of another player and stamping him down in front of you, though most of the time meaningless, is SO satisfying.  There's another plus 1 point.  The third bonus point comes from the fact that almost everyone I know loves playing this silly little game!  This game is great for getting the games going.  The game is geared for younger kids and features simple arithmetic, but the adults I play with eat it up.  Any game that gets people playing gets a bonus point.  Yeah, Zeus is an 8.

Ha! Yeah, it's cute. Actually, I can't think of another card game that plays like this one. Sure, your card pulls have a lot to do with it, and it's certainly a push-your-luck kinda game too. But there is a charm to the art, the Zeus piece, and the simple mathyness of it all. I think this would work well with children and adults, so that's saying something for a card game released from a child game company.

Very simple game, has a strange educational feel. Teaches 2 digit addition and Greek gods. Oh yeah, there is a fun little game here too. The counting up to a number feel works better in Boom-O than here, and the amount of strategy is somewhat limited. Still, very easy to teach, and you have to think fast. I think it works a bit better in 2-player.

More sneaky entertainment in game form by those geniuses at Gamewright. This time your kid learns the mental arithmetic that needs to become second-nature when learning later subjects, and even some characters from Greek mythology sneak into the subconscious. The underlying game is perfectly fine, nothing special, but neither does it have any problems that I could see. Not one I'd play with gamers, though.

Reasonably inoffensive card game for kids. I like the art; I don't even mind the gratuitous mathematics, which ordinarily bothers me. What I don't like, and again for a kids' game I [b]more[/b] don't like it, is the indeterminate length. The running total can bounce up and down a lot, and I can't imagine too many kids in the target audience having the patience to play until someone has won four rounds. I sure don't.

This is quickly becoming one of my four-year-old's favorite games.  She is learning to add and this game makes it a lot of fun for her.  

This is a fast filler type game.  The players are continually stealing Zeus from each other, which is casual fun for the first half of the game.  Once the total starts getting close to 100, it becomes a lot more tense as the players try to time the total reaching 100 while in possession of Zeus for the win.  With experienced players, five minutes is an above average length game.

Decent kids math game where you try to get the numeric total to 100 while keeping in possession of the Zeus figure. There are some special cards, but you basically play cards down and take Zeus when you hit a multiple of 10 or if playing a special card.

Skills used: Zeus features adding, subtracting, knowledge of 10's facts, doubling skills and rounding.

RATING: 7
Excellent card game that helps young ones with their math, cards characters look great and it's really fun to play. Basically stealing Zeus on every multiple of 10, once the score gets to 100 the player holding Zeus scores the round. Gets exciting when cards allow u steal Zeus and change the score. Plays well and it's educational, personally I love the art work on the cards, nice game.

Basically a kids' game for practicing addition/subtraction. A round can take forever as the total fluctuates wildly, with Zeus being stolen left and right. 

...and then the perfect idea hit us - Drinking game! Add the duty to drink a shot whenever you actually steal Zeus, and suddenly it becomes a whole lot more fun!

Doesn't work with 2 at ALL. You really lose out being able to "sneak" a card and thus play during another's turn-which I think would make this game work.

Will need to revisit after playing 3+

I think this is a kids' game, and as such it's probably fine. But it was offered to the table as an alternative to 6 Nimmt, and in that regard it failed badly.

Not much to this game.  Minimal strategy, yet as you are approaching winning a round (or the game), you do get a little adrenaline rush, even if you realize you're at the hands of luck of the draw.

Better than Lobo 77, but that's a low hurdle.  Not as good as Uno - no Olympian height there either!  It is just too random to invest any effort in - even kids don't stay interested long.  This class of game has the winner decided mainly by the action of all the other players rather than anything very positive or clever that the winner does themselves. Avoid & play the dice game Pig if you want addition practice!

[1 play] This is an ok kids games, not much here for adults alone. The strategy is like a basketball game - unless you are really bad or really unfortunate you will be in it until the end, and then all that matters is how you play those last couple cards.

Fun artwork, quality components, and another decent kid's game by Gamewright.

Most recent play 6-22-07 with Drew and Garrett.

Rating 8 as a children's game. In that capacity, it's good practice for simple arithmetic and also develops basic card-playing concepts (choosing which card to play to a trick, which card to lead, etc.). The Zeus figure is cute too. (For a similar game that is faster, teaches similar skills and works better as a light game for adults, see Straw.)

RATING: 5.5
A bit long to play for what it is (I would recommend just playing rounds and ignoring the spell out "ZEUS" rule). Playing a few rounds is fun, and I will probably hang onto it for a silly filler.

RATING: 6
I like to use short games as a math warm-up with my 6-yo, and a round of Zeus on the Loose is a perfect fit for that. It's a fun way to get in a little bit of addition review, and it helps her mental math abilities. 

We both enjoy the game, although it can drag on a bit (for my purposes) if we're both keeping the power cards to use near the end. I may end up removing a few of the power cards from the deck to keep it in the 5-10 minute range.

This is one of the few kids' games that I can envision pulling out occasionally with adults as well.

It can take a long time (more than 15 minutes) to play if you are playing with someone who likes to dump the high number of Mt. Olympus.  So instead of having 90, a card is played that changes the digit order.  Now Mt. Olympus is at 9, which is a long way from the desired 100.

At least in two player games the strategy becomes obvious after a few plays but still a somewhat entertaining game and a good math exercise with some extra strategy for younger players.

Greece is the word...

Scaling Mt. Olympus....one card at a time.    

An innocuous traipse towards the clouds,  this is merely the game of 99 dressed in an evening gown.  While I don't necessarily find it an unpleasant experience,  the game play has less meat on the bone than seven day old carrion.

As an educational tool, it has more pizzazz than the mundane use of flash cards - with the advantage being,  that it operates under the guise of being a game.

I don't know why, but I love that Zeus figure....  I get really happy the moments I possess it, and really ticked off when he gets taken, but it makes it more satisfying when I get Zeus back.  Now I just need an Aphrodite figure.

Catch Zeus if you can! The great Greek god has bolted from Mount Olympus and it’s up to you to nab this dashing deity. Play cards strategically, adding numbers as you climb up the mythic mountain. Grab Zeus when the total reaches a multiple of 10. Better yet, summon the strength of Apollo, Poseidon, or all-powerful Hera to bring Zeus within your grasp. Reach the top of Mount Olympus with Zeus in hand and you’re a mortal among the gods. To play is human. To win, divine!

Did you know that, in addition to their supreme powers, the Greek gods were endowed with the special ability to change the course of card games? Well, at least that’s the case in Zeus on the Loose! As you figure out how harness the strengths of the various gods within, you’ll sharpen strategic thinking along with valuable addition and subtraction skills. A quick warning about Hera: Though she may be the most powerful goddess in the game, don’t get on her bad side or else she might wind up helping an opponent steal Zeus and win!

(May 2012 after 1 4p game) - A 5 year old boy beat his sister and 2 adults - many chuckles and giggles were had as he acquired the Zeus piece in numerous ways (scoring exactly 100 w/o owning the piece), stelaing the Zeus, etc.  Great exercise in math addition, including an occasional subtraction (-10).

Simple and quick math card game with some strategy and very cool artwork that appeals to kids.  Zeus has a big head, or so my son wishes to point out, and it's true, he is not quite proportioned but neither are the characters on the cards.  Good game to play with my 8 year old daughter, not so good with my 12 yo son who gives it a big *yawn* and insists on continuing to diss Zeus.

Daughter has outgrown, not really enough interest to keep it around.  Passing on.

Fast paced and silly, what really made this game enjoyable was the special cards that often produce unexpected results when played, especially when the value of the stack gets very close to or right at 99.  Not sure if it stands up to repeated plays, but the two sessions I participated in certainly garnered a lot of laughs throughout.

RATING: 4.5
I think the key to making this game fun is forcing people to play each card in 1 second or less.  Unfortunately, some of the various god cards look just sufficiently similar at a glance, that you kind of have to read them to be sure what they do.  Nonetheless, it's a pointedly goofy slugfest to 100 points, by way of explicitly setting the number to 50 or 99, or rounding it, or reversing its digits.  There are even player-skipping cards whose only real use are to procrastinate giving someone the 100-point finish line.

Los jugadores van sumando puntos al Monte Olimpo. Cuando un jugador hace que llegue hasta un múltiplo de 10, se roba a Zeus. Algunas cartas permitirán robar a Zeus, agregar o restar valor al monte. Cuando el Monte llegue a 100, el jugador que tenga a Zeus gana.

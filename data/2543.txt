Pompeji (4 plays) is another game where each card placed gives opportunities to everyone else meaning the best play isn't always the one that gives you the most points. On a player's turn, he places a card on a common tableau and then scores points based on matching colors and building types. However, since it is a common tableau, it is easy to set up plays for opponents and guarding against this is critical to doing well. This side of it is more opaque to my kids and so I've refrained from playing it at that level. However, even just played with a "maximize your score" mentality, there is a lot to consider. Which card to play and where is not always obvious and players have the ability to set themselves up for a high scoring immediate second play once a game.

Good little tile (card) placement game. Simple rules, OK artwork, plays good with three.

RATING: 1
Production: Superfluous buildings encircling each card seriously interfere with gameplay, obscuring the colors, which are poorly differentiated anyway.  The rectangular cards make it difficult to see diagonals.  All-around terrible graphical design.  Play: A limited handsize helps keep down the calculation time.  A different theme, art, and production quality might make this game accessible for me, but as is I wasn't entertained.  (0+0+1) (1 play)

A puzzle placement card game. Each card depicts a type of building on a different background colour, with a value between 1 and 7. Cards are placed for form a 7x7 card "board", but you cannot place adjacent to a like building/colour already on the board. Once placed, you score points for more than 1 building and/or colour in a line diagonally, vertically or horizontally. Very busy artwork makes spotting ideal moves quite difficult. This one reminds me a bit of Take It Easy, and is a nice enough game.

Diseño feo, difícil de ver. Aunque tiene bastante azar, sobre todo al avanzar la partida por los posibles combos, es probable que eso no eso no haya sido tan determinante para la nota como la sensación de estar jugando algo tan feo, donde los caminos y las posibilidades se ven mal.

RATING: 4
Pompeji is a somewhat mathy filler card game. Gameplay is ok, but so heavily dependent on good card draws that it can get really frustrating if you don't get what you need to score big for several turns in a row (plus it usually also destroys any hopes of winning unless your opponent hits a bad streak as well). Ok as a quick filler only if people don't think too hard about optimizing their moves.

The card colors are pretty horrible, though, especially in low-light situations.

RATING: 3
Tedious game with horrible graphics that's really nothing more than an exercise in number crunching and visual awareness.  You study the board, you find a good play for your card, you play it, you tally your points.  This continues until the game ends and someone wins, probably whoever got the last turn.  Not worth the effort for a game with no real strategy or control beyond simple optimization.  If you like dizzying and pointless spatial analysis games like Metro, you might like this.  Or you could just buy a GRE practice exam.

Raised from a 6 to a 7.  Play this with my wife and the games are always close now.  Though it is a very random game, stategies are starting to evolve and with the amount of cards pulled during play, it tends to even out a bad hand.  Still a light card game and still fun to play.  Need to see how well it does with 3 or 4 players though.

Abstract addition exercise. Moves slowly because of the endless calculation and is further hindered by the nearly unrecognizable card colors. Massively favors the player who manages to draw the game end card.

RATING: 4
Ooof. Abstract mathiness can be a good thing. Luck of the draw can also be a good thing. Not in the same game, though. The art is dull, and the colour scheme is drabness personified. In fairness, there's quite a lot of thinkiness to it, and it's about the only game that will make me succumb to AP, at which point everyone else leaps in with their 'I'll play another card' bonus to hilarity all round.

Playing this is painful on every level.

RATING: 6
It’s an analysis game, trying to see your best scoring opportunities across multiple dimensions (matching colour, matching building type, in 3 road directions) in a 7 by 7 grid that the players build up card by card. The deck is made up of 49 cards - 7 suits, each suit represents a building, is valued from 1 to 7, and 7 colours are scattered randomly amongst it. A turn is to play a card from your hand of 3 cards, score it, replenish. The colours are subtle, and make score searching difficult until you get used to them by mid-game.

The trick is to not only see the best score from your hand on your own turn, but you also have a joker if you can see a big score but you don’t have the right card, plus you get one interrupt during the game to play out of sequence. Despite plenty of opportunity for analysis paralysis, we kept the game moving, and there was no down time given the amount of computational planning to be done, especially as you’re looking for opportunities outside your turn. The scores each turn got progressively bigger and players leapfrogged each other.

Never play this with anyone though who MUST determine that he has the very best score he could possibly get each and every turn.

Enjoyable Adlung tile-laying-like card game that feel more like a two-player puzzle. If there's something going on beyond finding the optimal placement for scoring on your turn, I haven't discovered it. I guess there are a moves that could thwart an opponent's plans, but the card drawing prevents long-range planning.

Cute little abstract game from Adlung-Spiele.  However, the operation of scoring is too tedious to prevent me from liking it. Not a bad game, but it's not for me.

I don't like the illustration: they are too busy and the printed colours are confusing.

This reminds me a little bit of Knizia's Kingdoms, if only because you're playing cards to set up a grid that will score you points at the end of a game.  The colors are faint, though, and require either marking the cards or making sure no-one is colorblind.  People who enjoy multiplayer puzzle games will likely dig this one.

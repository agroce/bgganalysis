Why buy a miniature to take the place of a piece of paper and pencil?

If you play Ogre (with the minis!) you should really think of picking this book up.  All the rules you'd ever want but not really need.  For me the power of Ogre is the simplicity of the game and these rules muddy the water a bit.

Like it's map-and-counters boardgame sibling, it is still the closest thing to a pre-packaged game about Bolos. What's not to like?

Fast mechanics, yet fun. I was drawn to this by the solitaire play. A simple (especially when played on hexes), quick, but challenging game.

Would like to get 1 or 2 Mark III or Mark V OGRE miniatures.

The theme for Ogre is excellent, and the miniatures were well done, but the game system shows its age. In particular ranges and measuring make for crowded and unrealistic looking games.

Great minatures traslation of OGRE and G.E.V. as an asides the fact that they took the trouble to do a full color rulebook with tons of pictures in 1992 speak highly of the love SJGames have for their signature games. I also love that they provided a rationalization for scale that ends any arguements regarding realism.

The theme for the miniatures version of Ogre is good, and the miniatures themselves were nice, but the translation of the game system feels very much like it was transferred directly into a miniatures a game without much thought. A particular problem are weapon ranges, which are tragically too short for a miniatures game making for unrealistic looking and awkward playing games.  Whoever did the translation probably does not play miniatures games or had his hands tied by the original publisher (from my personal experience, having worked in the industry for almost 40 years, if I had to guess, I'd say it was the latter).  Doubling or even tripling the weapon ranges would be a good start to make this into a better playing game.

I've owned the rules for Ogre Minis for years.  I purchased a few of the miniatures, but have never assembled them, nor have I actually played a game.  Maybe someday when I have time and money to set up something good.

If you're a miniatures wargamer, in the classic sense of using rulers to measure distance etc, and you love Ogre, then this is for you.

If you love Ogre, but aren't a miniatures gamer, this probably won't convert you.

I'm a fan of the SJG minis, and have a huge selection of the metal ones, as well as twenty sets from the first KS for the plastic minis. Gameboards are made from Heroscape tiles to heighten the minis effect.

The Guns of Sarajevo at Millenniumcon 14 (2011) - what a hoot to play.  Paneuropean planetary defense is annihilated however my defending Ogre wipes out a huge number of invaders much to the surprise of everyone.

Still have the book.  Tossed the miniatures a long time ago.  My first attempt at miniature painting and it just wasn't for me.  The lead miniatures were cool, though, especially the OGREs.

Excellent set of miniature rules.  OGRE gets better in 3d.  (The miniatures from SJGames are pricey -- but you can occasionally find them on clearance.)

The Miniatures tabletop wargame version of the Ogre boardgame. I'd love to give it 10 - but frankly the parlous state of the off-on-off miniatures production, making the Ogre models and many of the classic vehicles themselves ridiculously over-priced, prevents me from giving it the top score. Plastic models will now hopefully become available if a new KS project is successful, so here's hoping that happens and eventually includes Ogres in kit-form.

Ogre with inches, replacing the hex map with a terrain table. Nothing incredibly new here for Ogre fans, and miniatures gamers might get turned off by the simple "wargame-y" rules. Play this one if you love Ogre but don't like hexes.

For some reason the miniatures version didn't play quite as well as the micro boardgame version. It was still fun, and the miniatures were certainly cool, but it just didn't work as well as other sci fi miniature games.

Ogre, but not as good as the Hex and Chit version in my opinion.

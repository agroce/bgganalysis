This was probably my favourite of the old Avalon Hill games that I haven't played now for over 20 years. I'm a bit scared to go back to it now as I have such find memories that I would hate for them to be broken in the same was that, say, a recent game of Civilisation did

Played this game to death, back in the day. The S&T issue version was notable in that SPI printed half the counter sheets with an heretical AH-style glossy finish and half with their standard matt finish to see what difference it would make in the issue's feedback results - none as it turned out.

RATING: 6.5
Oozing with flavor of discovery and colonizing. But with a hex grid, it seem weird to hold an empty land hex. The declaration of ports and colonies are the only logic source of income besides the mines.

Coming and going of colonist and conquistadors from turn to turn is interesting. Comparable to brittania whereby tribes of different colors comes and goes. Each color have a prominent time in history.

Some rules need clarification. Long game. Approx 24 hours for full game to be played to completion.

An unusual game from AH in the mid 70s.  Unfortunately a lot more work went into the Spanish colonists who have conquistadors and priests; the other three nations are almost afterthoughts (although Britain does get privateers).

Game starts very slowly and care must be taken in the early turns to ensure that you do not bankrupt your country.

Another classic that holds it's rating more by nostalgia than actual merit. I suspect if played again the random events would be considered too chaotic (they can easily put a player out of the running early on in a 4-5 hour game)

Would love to see this revisited and streamline, I used to love it. (A fair indication of how much this used to get played in the 70's is that I once won as the German Bankers - who have no units and can only influence the game indirectly with loans and bribes. 5 hours of that!)

Good for its time, much too long now and without much in the way of redeeming features. Replaced a real sense of exploration with pure tactics - do I want to land in Hudson's bay and move south into America, or is Argentina a better bet? Or go for Central America? I know what's there in all these cases, so it's more a question of choosing what to exploit. Some neat variants in The General, though. I liked the one where the French got to coexist with the natives instead of the usual slaughter, it's nice to give the game some kind of moral compass by allowing at least one player not to have to commit genocide. Oddly, I also liked the slavery optional; I mean, why go halfway? You've gone to the trouble of including the explicit destruction of the natives and the looting of their empires for personal financial gain, why completely omit slavery and the slave trade? Next, let's do a game about assasinating judges in Caracas. New World was this stripped down, and scored by capturing much of the flavor while being much simpler & shorter. It still required you to eradicate the natives and loot their cities, though.

I love the theme but otherwise I'd not recommend this.  Looking forward to the new remake by Heritage this year.  This AH version has you recounting all your troops for attrition, resource collecting, revolts and then again for maint. each turn.  There is also movement logging.  If streamlined it would be a quicker and fun game.  Compared to most AH titles this is a nice one.

Well, I was once a devotee of Sid Meier's Civilisation, and then of his Colonisation (and it seems to me that that game found an idea or two here), so naturally I love this.  If one's prepared to undertake various chores that would be better handled by a computer (e.g. attrition roles for *every occupied hex*), then this game is very rewarding, especially with more than two players.  Solitaire play is quite fun too.

While taking a long day to play, this is a terrific multi-player game and best for social gamers who enjoy immersing themselves in this period of history.  One of the best STRATEGY AND TACTICS magazine games published, the Avalon Hill version spruced up the title to enable up to five players (the English, the French, the Spanish, the Portuguese, and the German Bankers).  Each player will tackle their challenge in different ways and have different tools to use--most notably the Pirates for the English (Drake and Hawkins) and the Conquistadors and Missionaries (for the Spanish).  Exploration forays are torn between settling colonists or going after gold and other "discoveries" (e.g., the Seven Cities of Cibola).  While war between players is possible and often happens, it can be quite expensive and sometimes not worth the cost!  Far better to let disease and the natives (and random events) ruin your competition as you stay one jump ahead in grabbing new land, finding new treasure, and uncovering new discoveries!.  

I played the magazine version to death--even with my handmade Portuguese counters--until the map nearly disintegrated and the counters practically rounded.  Highly recommended.

Attempted a few plays (of AH version) many years ago ... recall it was somewhat abstract.  Game theme probably best done as an area movement or "connecting boxes" game rather than as a hex based game.  Perhaps a card driven sytem would work.  The recent "Here I Stand" (GMT) very superficially covers aspects of this period of exploration/exploitation and its impact on European affairs.

Pretty good game. I like 4X games and this definitely fits the bill. Explore, Expand, Exploit, Exterminate is all in this game. The one problem is that it takes a looooong time to do all those things. You're also dealing with a large scale so interaction amongst players isn't necessarily there (good and bad). There is some accounting involved when planning expeditions, but nothing overly complex or distracting in my opinion. Overall fun but length detracts from the experience

When this game was first published, I was impressed with the number of innovations and it was one of the few SPI games I actually played frequently.

No doubt, if it were redone today it would be cleaner; eliminating the pointless hex grid and the endless die rolls for uprisings and attrition.  But in those days simulation games had to have a hex grid to be taken seriously and there were always die rolls for everything to account for uncertainties outside the game’s scope.

This is one of my most loved games.  Having no siblings and no wargaming friends when I was a kid, I literally played the game hundreds of times by myself.  It was the first game I ever owned that had actual solitaire rules.  I love the fact that it was hex based and you could slog through the jungles, one painful hex ant a time.  I would write labels, naming each of the cities as my colonists populated the New World.  Wonderful memories of a true classic.

These comments are for the SPI version.  Surviving for the first few turns seems to be the essential key to this game as it can be really tough.  There's a few questions here and there, but basically the game isn't that hard to understand.  The SPI version could definitely have used an extra half sheet or full sheet of markers, plus a well thought out record sheet would be extremely helpful.  Also, this can be a long game and after the halfway point the game can seem a bit repetitive.  Still, it is unlike many wargames and an interesting view of the period.

There is some good to the game, but it takes much, much longer to play than I expected.  The move plotting is great but it takes so long for beginners the game slows to a crawl.  We got four turns done in about four hours, the glacial pace sapping some of the fun.  I also imagine the game will play itself out in similar patterns each time.  Given the choice, I'd go for TimJim's game Age of Exploration first.  Still, glad to have finally played after years of ownership and am not opposed to playing again sometime.

Even with major flaws in it, this can be quite exciting.  A great forbearer to Endeavor and Age of Empires III.  Would love to try a game with multiple players as I have only ever played it with 2 players.  Want the SPI version that is in S&T.

OK, I love lots of those old AH titles, but this one has its special flair; all the way you have tough decisions to make; the game has many faces from a tactical exploration game which sees lots of realistic losses of poor settlers to a wargame, in which you have to fight your fellow european enemies in direct sea and land battles or by defending against pirates, who want to steal your hard mined gold; when you love the age of exploration and complexity won´t push you away, I think this could be your game, even after all those years; typical AH board and counter quality; good for 2 and 3 players; I hope a future GMT edition won´t kill too much of the game´s deep

Not really a simulation of history, but a fun game for builder-gamers who don't like to fight very much.

I played the German Banker and won by a ridiculous margin which suggests the rules are broken.

I love this game! It is the best solitare game I've ever played. As far as a historical recreation it is a miss. However, the mechanics make it fun anyway.  The game definitely succeeds in giving you the feeling of the Age of Exploration.

This game has some flaws: it is much too long, attrition and bookkeeping are tedious, the enforceable treaties tend to block the game, the combat table favors smaller forces over larger forces, and the best strategy is to ignore gold completely (just ship colonists). In particular, the solitaire scenario can be won trivially, just by shipping colonists to Norumbega and marching from there to the neighbouring R2 areas.

Yet the first 6 turns or so are quite fun. You get discovery, conquest and empire building with a rather simple system. Fond memories of playing this game for hours with my brother and sisters... or sinking the entire Spanish fleet in the Gulf of Mexico with my French warships...

A lot of the people who gave this a high rating admit they haven’t played in years - that's a bad sign. I mean, I remember the Atari 2600 being fun ... but today I'd rather pluck nose hairs than play it. Anyhow, the complexity and random events of this game turn me off from even trying it.

This was quite the fun game when it first came out. My friend got it with the magazine and I later bought it in the flat pack. I think I have the AH version as well. Nice maps, great mechanics, a bit of luck involved, especially if you get a monarch change to a lower level.

Too long, too fiddly, too much luck - playing as the English on my first event roll my king went to a D class, and I then rolled 6's for the next five turns event rolls getting no income whatsoever, compounded by having the incresed costs event twice on top of this. I know this was extreme, but still makes the game too broken for me.

Interesting colonization game that uniquely has both hexes and area control mechanics in the same game.  In the beginning, you play against the game (which the attrition could get quite brutal), conquering the locals plus exploiting their riches and competing a little against the other players. Later in the game after your colonies are profitable are more stable and all the lands are taken up, the game moves to the phase where then you start constantly fighting against each other (esp the leader). 

Find it to be a good game in which the theme definitely comes through pretty well and have some unique mechanics fro a hex and counter game.

Very fine multi-player esp if you practice surgery on a couple of the more dubious rules such as the maximum settlers per province per player rule & the only count VP for political control at the end of the game rule, both of which turn the New World into a love fest of inter-european harmony - until the last turn or so that is, then everybody starts killing each other. With fixes for these in place though, the game is pretty damn good. You can also spend a lot of this game being everybody's poor relation only to surge to victory at the end which is a feature that I particularly like.

Greatest cut-throat capable game. Not too hard to teach. In just one sitting between 2 grognards and 2 noobs, we watched the noobs transform into seasoned serious wargamers bent on the annihiliation of their opponents.

My wife loved this game, but never had the patience to actually play for the full slog.  Very cool concept -- if only the magazine version had included a few more counters!  I need to set aside a weekend and slog through this again.  

I doubt this would seem as cool to me now as it did when I first played it (the amount of behind-the-scenes bookkeeping was pretty tedious) but I'm sure I'd have fun.  I wish the revised version would somehow see the light of day.

This game sat on a shelf for years with no one touching it let alone opening it.  This was after a contentious game where the players developed the same hatred toward each other as the nations of the period felt.  Gives me the shivers just thinking about it.  It was one HECK of a game though.

My comments are based on playing this for the first time in 2014, not playing this when it initially came out.  I suspect this mostly economic game was innovative for its time.  The game does a good job at capturing its theme, historical figures, and the dangers faced by the early explorers and conquistadors.  The game is mostly about developing your economic engine and watch it evolve over time from being heavy on looting and mines initially and then progressing to resources and colonists.  

That being said, the game has its weaknesses.  The countries are not balanced.  Almost every phase of the game turn involves multiple rolls of the dice and the random events can have a dramatic impact on your income and survival, especially in the beginning.  There is tons of bookkeeping (planning your expeditions, determining your resource income, calculating maintenance costs) which requires you to repeatedly check all of your counter values and types.  When you add in the above repetitive actions and the length of the game, it tends to outweigh the positives in this game.  The game is not complex by wargame standards, but it could benefit from some streamlining.  Using cards versus dice rolls would help deal with the random events.

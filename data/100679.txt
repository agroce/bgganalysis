Nice and simple game to play a quick game with any, funny illustrations and very fast to play. We will be a fighter who must be the last man standing or accumulate more points of glory at the end of the 7 rounds, each one will have our different fighting style and there are also game modes per team.

RATING: 8
A simple fantasy combat game with a few gimmicks and cute mechanics that give it flavor. Distinct characters, use of the bottom of the box as your playing area, and a sweet twist where players who eliminate others early on get pelted with rocks for possible damage (by the eliminated player serving as a 'crowd' proxy). Almost like a little bit of programming because you have to move and attack based on the card you've chosen for that round. Fun die roller here, for when you want a pure throwdown like a King of Tokyo.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Like King of Tokyo, this is a wacky, beat everyone up affair. Except in this case, the emphasis is on each character having special moves and abilities as they all contend with each other in an arena, rather than a large city.

Definitely room in my collection for both games. Prefer this with at least four or five.

Very fun game, quick (finally a game that last effeclty the time on the box) and easy to learn, a no-mind rumble with very good arts. 
I like the contemporary moves' choise and the light strategy, not so much the heavy luck factor (you have no control at all on the dice) that brings down the rating to 7...
A good alternative to King of Tokyo.

Great arena fighting game with a king of tokyo type feel, but removing the randomness of the dice with card play.  While the fighters have very different health totals, this is all balanced well with defense values and the fact that other fighters will naturally team up on them to take them down.  The art is also great and plays fairly quickly.

A worthy contestant for King of Tokyo? Yes.
Ultimate Warriorz is as simple as King of Tokyo, offers different mechanics and still fits the same spot as King of Tokyo.

In my opinion it is a fresh approach to light fun party games. With the blufing/gambling of the card play, the different special abilites and the movement on the board it feels deeper than KoT. Time will tell.

RATING: 4
I wasn't a big fan of this one.  The game consists of everyone simultaneously playing a card which dictates their movement,defense, and battle ability for the turn, and the cards are then carried out.  Win by either being the sole survivor or doing the most damage to others after a set number of rounds if multiple players survive.

The game was mostly about not getting caught with your pants down, which pretty just meant keeping a high shield as much as possible, as players with low shields will often be the target due to being easier to hit (you're just rolling a d6 against the shield value, and you score points for doing damage, so it makes sense to pick on the player where you can do as much damage as possible).

Overall, just not very interesting, and I'm also concerned about character balance (larger characters have lower shield values, which makes them frequent targets).

RATING: 4
The tension of this game revolves around when to play your cards, as you'll only get to play each one once. Do you play your best cards early? Or do you save them for the end? Do you play a card that risks being useless or one that guarantees you'll be able to hit someone?

Sadly, those aren't very interesting questions.

Also, I shouldn't have said guarantee hitting someone, as really you are only guaranteed to be able to swing at someone, as this game features randomness post decision. So if the dice come up bad, you'll hit no one and it is as if your turn never happened.

The best thing about this game is that it plays very quickly.

When the owner was setting up the game, I said to him, is this game from France? He said, yes, how did you know? Because, I said, only the French toss casual racism and sexism into their games so nonchalantly.

RATING: 8
Great fast light game in the vein of King of Tokyo. The card play makes it a little more strategic, but not too much so. While people can gang up on the smaller folks, the fact that they are harder to hit and the damage mechanism if someone is killed early makes it more likely in the early going that you will attack the larger monsters. Also this ganging up feature is fine for such a quick game that plays with 8 people.

I like KoT but prefer Ultimate Warriorz.

Not yet sure what to make of this one. Seems feather-light, but then it's not really trying to be a deep gaming experience, instead just a fun, dice-chucking romp. I like how easy the rules are to explain despite the bit of asymmetry, and how quickly the game plays.
But that being said I guess I'm still not convinced there's enough game here, as indeed you can see whatever semblance of a strategy (take points off the big guys and try to last until the end, say) shredded by a few bad rolls, with no ability to mitigate the luck or salvage something out of a bad roll Yatzee/King of Tokyo-style.
Still, I was able to play with my 8- and 4-year-olds, and the 4-year-old even won. Which is to say, we had fun together!

Ultimate Warriorz is a simple, pure combat game that plays quickly.  That's a good thing since it really doesn't have much substance.  I enjoy that each character has a couple of unique powers and different sizes and life pools.  It also seems very well balanced with no character seeming to have any real advantage over another.  The problem for me is that it's just sort of "bleh".  I just wish there was more to it than just "fight each other".  Not really my cup of tea, but I would play it again if in the right mood.

RATING: N/A
In the game, each player picks one of the included characters, then either individually or in teams they fight it out in the small arena by carefully managing their action cards. After each player picks an action card in secret, players act in order of initiative, counting down from eight to seven to six, etc., with a player calling out their action when their initiative number is called. (In the event of a tie, you refer to values on the individuals cards to see who acts first.) Faster characters tend to be weaker, but ideally they can get their best shots in first, with dice being rolled to determine the results of various attacks.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This was touted as being a King of Tokyo/New York killer by some, but I just can't see how that can possibly be. In those games, the Yahtzee mechanism coupled with the card play makes it feel more interesting than just rolling dice to attack people. Ultimate Warriorz throws that all away, and focuses solely on the dice rolling. There's no variation from game to game. It's just about which characters are participating versus which ones aren't. The game does utilize a very similar mechanism to Mission: Red Planet, where you choose cards to play secretly, and they play out in descending order. While I like this method, it feels very awkward here. Some cards have special abilities, but most don't. It just gives you certain stats for the round, such as defense and the dice you roll. It sort of feels like a distant cousin to Lord of the Rings: Confrontation in how it handles combat, but I really dislike that form of conflict resolution. This is just a very average game that does absolutely nothing for me. You might as well just roll dice and see who wins.

Would rather play King of Tokyo or (better yet) King of New York.

It's the kind of games you want to play when there's many players around, but.... it doesn't work with high player counts: characters with low defense values will be attacked consistently as easy preys and will not survive, Characters with high defense will survive, but their low attack values will probably keep them from winning many points...

The decisions are also not interesting, besides chosing the card you'll play. Yes, it's a filler, but there's nothing really to decide. Players tend to attack the easier target to secure points, moves are a bit blind, there are not alternative strategies...

It's game just to fool around. It'll provide a clumsy excuse to roll some dice and see what happens.

We all know that any game that replaces an S with a Z in the title bears the hallmarks of class and quality. We know what to expect. Here, there's a simultaneous blind revelation of cards each turn to determine turn order and smack-strength, and then you just roll dice at each other to wear down hitpoints, with players being eliminated once hitpoints are gone. Last one standing wins. If multiple people are left standing after the last round, the player with the most hits wins. Or in other, simpler words, the players who win the most in the meta are picked on and eliminated first, meaning this is great game choice for those who win less often in the meta. It provides some random fun as a one-off if played at pace, but it brings little new to the table and I have no need to go back to the well.

Potentially a game the influenced King of Tokyo. There is a similar feel. I don't particularly like either game very much.

This gets a lot of comparisons to King Of Tokyo, and while it shares some traits with KOT (quick, easy, fun, good with many players) it just doesn't seem as fun as KOT.  It gets to the table often, especially with 7 or 8 players, but it does not get the same requests as KOT.

A light monster mash, which the group compared favourably to King of Tokyo. I was not so sure as the result of UW felt more determined by the initial allocation of character card than anything else. KoT has a choice of strategies, even if they are very broad strokes (scoring points, buying cards, eliminating others) and very few tactical choices; whereas UW had limited strategic options and was solely about the immediate tactics of your situation. Take your pick, I guess.

12-09-2015. Rated after 3 games. To me, feels like a cross between Citadels and King of Tokyo.

At setup, each player gets a setup card with defense statistics. Each player then selects a battle card. Each battlecard holds important information. The speed of the attack (8 to 1) is important for the resolving of the cards, this happens from high to low. All cards also have a move, melee and ranged statistic. You can choose to perform these in any order, but they must be performed. This allows your warrior to move, attack (roll dice).

If you attack a Warrior, you use the dice on Melee/Ranged attack to target the defender. S/he has a defense value, you need to roll with your attack dice in order to hit. If you hit, you take HP-tokens from the defender as VPs. If yo are the first to hit an opposing Warrior, you get its 3 VP HP token as a bonus.

The game is fun. It plays larger numbers easier then KoT. Gameplay is maybe a bit less deep, but you feel more involved as rouds go quickly. Components are ok, especially for the price.

Feeling like a easy to explain arena game? Not too much fuzz, great fun and design. 

The board design brings this game up a notch, as you flip it up and turn it into an Colosseum with a couple of cardboard walls and torches, which come with the box. It really adds to the game. 

Without the arena, the gameplay would score a point lower, as it's nothing too fancy. You have 8 gladiators, each with his/her own special powers, attacks and physical strength. The game is mostly dice based, so luck is such a big factor that I have yet to see how you can bring solid strategy to the table. 
Great for an appetizer, but not for a main course. Nevertheless, I definitely like to bring it to the table.

Ultimate Warriorz has a similar feel to that of King of Tokyo/King of New York and scratches that same “king of hill” itch, but the games are quite different in how they are played.  I still prefer King of Tokyo overall and am currently on the fence about Ultimate Warriorz (although that could change with additional plays).  Why?  Well, I am pretty worn out right now with the secret and simultaneous card selection mechanism that drives Ultimate Warriorz and sometimes I would just rather roll dice.  I also don’t like that everybody can decide to gang up and a single player and there is really nothing that can be done about it.  Yes, this game doesn’t last that long, but I prefer the choice offered in King of Tokyo where the player makes the decision on whether or not to take an action that may cause that player to end up in Tokyo with everybody else beating up on him.  There is perhaps more strategy available in Ultimate Warriorz since the characters all have different attributes, special powers, and movement, melee, and ranged attacks can occur in various combinations, but I prefer the more streamlined gameplay of King of Tokyo for a game like this.  I don’t dislike Ultimate Warriorz and will play it on occasion, but I don’t really like it that much either.

Also, for a game with so few spaces, movement is still really fun and crucial to your strategy!

I think I finally have a good King of Tokyo/New York killer. I've never been a big fan of the "King of" games because the Yahtzee mechanic is so dull and random. The player elimination is also a pretty big problem, though a lot of people try to downplay it.

This game has more interesting gameplay and plays a lot faster, but the player elimination is still an issue. However, the player elimination is softened a little in this game because the game plays so fast. In KoT if you get eliminated early you might have to wait close to an hour for the game to finish. I don't think a game of Ultimate Warriorz could ever last more than 30 minutes, and will likely be closer to 20 with experienced players even at the higher player count.

The asymmetry is what makes Ultimate Warriorz the better game. Each character has different stats and has two special abilities that make them all feel different.

The overall gameplay of UW is also better. Instead of having to wait for one person to roll all of their dice three times and then activate them, in this game everybody secretly plays a card at the same time (like in Citadels/Libertalia) and then they get resolved in a certain order. All you do on a turn is move and then throw some dice to attack. Very simple and turns are super quick.

Fun group game, definitely an improvement over the "King of" games.

Like KoT, you need more players. Deciding who and when to attack are the biggest parts of the game so more players means more choices. You also need to team up to take down some of the bigger monsters.

Light, casual, accessible game that you can get most players into quickly. Some light strategy and a well balanced game make this one that often hits out table.

I like the way you can pave your strategy with cards, and how the first kills giving more points are balancing the game, but this is still too much random for me!

A lot of talk of randomness and while this is true it has much more strategy than many dice chuckers out there. There is no re-rolls like KoT or Bang, or many of the other dice chuckers so the randomness is there. You roll a die, if it is a bad roll, you fail. I don't mind that. Quick, simple but sure, its random. 

There is however a card mechanic that overlies this and provides some strategy. Its thin but there is strategy here. The cards you play provide you with not only an amount of hand to hand or ranged attacks but also provides you with your armour value which is replaced once you play your next card. These values are also scaled so that the higher initiative cards have a higher armour value, meaning that these are played first which should provide you with more armour for the remainder of that round, and if your next card is played right, perhaps the round after that too.

I enjoyed it and while it will always be compared to KoT it is a different game with different mechanics. For me the biggest differences were the way the cards dictated your play and perhaps a simple, but bigger difference (and one that could break this game in some groups) is that you choose who you attack. If you are playing with precious people (some in my lunch group are a little precious) then this could cause friction at the table. Both games though have similarities, there is player elimination, big monsters and dice. Which one you prefer will be your personal preference and will also come down to the group you play with.

Fun game, could be compared to King of Tokyo, but I'd rather play King of Tokyo.

I think it's pretty accurate to compare this game to King of Tokyo, they're the same theme and weight and almost equal on enjoyment level yet play completely different.  King of Tokyo has a bit more variety with the feeling of evolving your monster, but this game is nice for having almost no down time.  Everyone plays a card and runs through very simple actions, lots of table talk goading people to attack others instead.

Easy, fun, simple, fast, maybe not overly replayable but surely a great filler when it's late, you're tired but you want a last half an hour of light fun. there's a lot of luck, almost no strategy, a lot of interaction and the components are great. fantastic idea of making the arena out of the box with pillars: it looks gorgeous!

Went into this thinking I would enjoy it more than I did. While it isn't so bad with more players (4 and above) it is pretty dull at 2.
My 12 year old son likes it more than me.
One issue is balance and certain characters seem to be better than others and I have heard the same from a few others.
EDIT:
Definitely better with more players and it has grown on me a little. I have increased my rating from 6.8 to 7.3

Fun attack your buddy game. The card play is much better than a lot of these games because of ranged attacks vs. hand to hand and the special abilities which can only be used once.

A quick fun dice chucking game. Not too much strategical depth but an excellent filler game.

Fun dice chucking arena battle between various asynchronous monsters. I'll stick with King of Tokyo, and New York, but am open to play this more.

I'm not a fan of auction games, and auctions are the main mechanic of Pay Dirt. Yet everything else in the game makes this one of the best auction games I have ever played! Very tense due to the high level of uncertainty (especially with the hardship cards). 

If you think there's a runaway leader problem, then you aren't playing it well!

I can't say that Pay Dirt isn't thematic. But it's... eh. It's a long series of doing the same thing over and over again with a very messy, unintuitive user interface. It lacks some pizazz to hook me. It's not a bad game, but I just can't really bring myself to care about it very much.

Εξόρυξη χρυσού στην Αλάσκα. Ο κάθε παίκτης αγοράζει εκτάσεις γης και σκάβει με τον εκσκαφέα του, μετά μεταφέρει το χώμα στο σημείο επεξεργασίας όπου διαχωρίζεται ουσιαστικά το χώμα από τον χρυσό. Κάθε γύρο γίνονται μερικοί πλειστηριασμοί για την αγορά καινούργιων μηχανημάτων και προσωπικού. Μετά ο καθένας κατανέμει τους εργάτες στα διάφορα μηχανήματα του και μεταφέρει/πλένει το χώμα. Υπόψη τα μηχανήματα χρειάζονται κάθε τόσο συντήρηση.

Στο τέλος του γύρου θα συμβεί ένα αρνητικό event στο κάθε παίκτη. Βέβαια αυτός που είναι τελευταίος σε χρυσό επιλέγει πρώτος πιο event από αυτά που τραβήχτηκαν για αυτή την γύρα, θέλει να φάει (προφανώς το πιο ήπιο) και μετά διαλέγει ο προτελευταίος σε χρυσό και πάει λέγοντας. Έτσι αυτός που προηγείται στο παιχνίδι καταλήγει με το χειρότερο event. Catch up mechanic δηλαδή.

Το παιχνίδι γενικά δεν με κέρδισε. Υπάρχει μικρή αλληλεπίδραση με τους αντιπάλους, το gameplay είναι μονότονα επαναλαμβανόμενο (σκάβω, μεταφέρω, πλένω, συντήρηση) και στην τελική το πόσο χρυσό θα βρεις είναι καθαρά random. Μπορεί 2 παίκτες να ξοδέψουν συνολικά από 8 εργάτες ο καθένας για την επεξεργασία ίδιου τύπου χώματος και στο τέλος ο ένας να βρει 3 σβώλους χρυσού και ο άλλος μόνο 1. 

Πολύ καλή ποιότητα παραγωγής και ωραίο artwork. Μας πήρε περίπου 2 ώρες για παρτίδα 4άρων παικτών.

Μου άρεσε το θέμα και η ποιότητα παραγωγής αλλά το gameplay είναι προβληματικό.

This game features reasonably fun auctions (reminiscent of Princes of Florence) for mining claims, equipment upgrades, and worker upgrades each round.  Following the auctions, players place their work crews on various spots on their mining operations card, or the gold sales spot, or the gear purchase spot.  

With workers in place, your mining operations card creates an assembly line of sorts, that sequentially mines, loads, and washes the ore.  At the end of the process, your ore produces gold nuggets, which are very nice components in this game.   

Each playing round also requires the distribution/drafting of "hardship cards" which cause bad things to happen to each player,which might feel a bit on the swingy side for some gamers, but they do add some interest, and theme I suppose, to the game.  

I found Pay Dirt to be very strong thematically, and I enjoyed watching the mechanics in the game produce beautiful gold nuggets.  Thematically, the game felt like an 8, but in terms of my enthusiasm to play Pay Dirt again, and my sense of its replayability, the game feels more like a 7.  After 2 plays, giving it a 7.

Seems almost hard to believe that this came from the designer of Alien Frontiers. Alien Frontiers has simple worker placement and resource management mechanics with a tiny bit of in your face "take that." Pay Dirt however has a somewhat confusing and very limited auction system wherein one person bids on one item in either equipment, personnel or claims. Other players then must bid on that item or pass. So that means if someone bids on say an excavator they want that means you cannot bid on the wash plant you want. or maybe we are totally wrong about that and if that's the case then the rules for the bidding are not very well written. Then there are the hardship cards that just seem to be a massive "take that" element every round of the game. Granted this is a totally different game than Alien Frontiers so you cannot really compare the two. But it just isn't for us for the reasons stated above.

RATING: 4
Mining-themed worker placement game which fancies itself as having "simultaneous" worker resolution, except for glaring exceptions in a key spot.  I surmise that they were trying to speed up the game, but it ultimately made it slower for us.  Enjoyed the "hardship" deck despite semi-random take that elements.  Overall, though, it wore out its welcome really quickly, and didn't have enough of a veneer to distinguish itself for me from a weak auction system.

The mechanism of the game isn't bad at all. Good idea for the workers and the dirt they create. But my enthousiasm was very much lowered because of the hardship cards. Sometimes someone gets easy away and another player is almost financial ruined by the card (unless he does nothing in a round). I was in money need and because of those cards I could never recover.

AI want to like this game. There is a lot to like. But it just ends up being a bad game due to the high luck factor and the odd screw over factor. I played a game today where I lost, despite getting many rare prospects, to someone else who only one because the got High scoring Barren tiles. They felt silly that they won and didn't feel much accomplishment for the victory. The game actively discourages getting points and punishes when you do which leads to a stalling mechanic. The whole thing just feels like it contradicts itself. Shame. The bidding section works well.

What should have been a solid Euro game is marred by a truly awful "event deck" mechanic that made the game instantly detestable in my eyes. I enjoy the theme, I love the "conveyor belt" mechanic, I don't mind the randomness of the gold tokens, and I think the techs and upgrades are interesting. But I hate the stupid freaking event deck, which is just so stupid and unnecessary. "Oh, you just spent your entire last turn building that? It's destroyed!" "Oh, you just spend two full rounds working up to do something? You can't do it!" 

Ugh, it would be like Uwe Rosenberg adding a Munchkin-themed "take that" deck to Agricola. Bad, bad decision. Unfun game.

RATING: 6
Well implemented theme and economic engine building game.  Quality of components are outstanding.  The downside of this game is the luck of not knowing which dirt you are getting and how many points it is worth.  It works with the theme, but you can't necessarily play that competitively.  You can win or lose this game by simply drawing a lower or higher value gold tile.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Played one 5-player game. Great theme and components. The actions of moving your tiles along your equipment to process the gold is well done.
I'm not sold on the auction mechanic however. I usually like auctions in games, even though I'm usually bad at them. The auction just doesn't seem to work well in this one. Being able to win multiple items during a single auction phase can strong-arm other players out of a round altogether. At the same time, limiting the options to bid on can make it even harder for players behind in the game to catch up. I think with fewer players this may not be as brutal, and reduce the downtime during the auction and hardship phases, which took up the bulk of our game.

Pay Dirt is an engine-building, worker placement game set in frigid Alaska for 2-5 players. Players are competing to manage and grow their entire mining outfit while acquiring the most gold before the ground is too frozen to dig. The Alaskan countryside is an inhospitable environment, so players will face hardships that affect their entire outfit – not to mention the ever-dropping temperature that will shut down their operation.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Pros: Cool theme, good components. The VP (gold) and money resource conversion and management aspect of the game is well integrated to the auction part of the game.

Cons: Game can drag during the auction phase if you are out of the running and during the hardship phase when you are reviewing the intial spread of cards.

The player interaction is mostly about smart auction play in correctly positioning yourself with money and bidding wisely. Success in the game hinges on that (since it determines how much you and others spend to get the things you need to improve your engine) as well as timing the end game. Some luck elements when it comes to the hardship cards, the personnel cards, and gold tile draw, but they all serve to keep everyone in the running.

Feels somewhat like a simpler Power Grid, without the area control.

I understand the need of having catchup mechanisms in games but Pay Dirt went to the next level. It’s a game that tries to kill you if you are doing well. The hardship phase drags for long and it’s ultra-annoying. It’s not a bad game, but it’s not for me or my group.

2014-11-25 : The designer of Alien Frontiers, a game I love, coupled with a theme that just oozes possibilities in the worker placement department - what could possibly go wrong ?

Well, lots of stuff it seems.

Even if we overlook the incomplete manual, and lousy layout including the usual suspects of icons which aren’t legible at all combined with wrong color choices the actual gameplay is a mess, with only the auction portion offering some tactical depth. You can see that they tried to speed up the game by having players place their workers simultaneously and only later realizing that this doesn’t mesh with the camp and claim gear tile buying mechanic, but didn’t bother to fix this big hole in the design. 

Then there’s the rather obvious rich gets richer imbalance they desperately tried to counter with event cards that manage to be both annoying and slowing the game down even more. The brokenness of the game-engine cannot be illustrated any better than with the rule that everybody gets $2K at the end of each round. Makes no thematic sense at all and is solely there as a lazy escape for the early-game money problem. 

Another KrapStarter (tm)  that should never have been released.

I think this game needed further development.  A good theme and components (though colours are too washed-out and brown), but there does't seem to be enough to do. There's a mash of mechanics (and it's not really worker-placement), but the best strategy seems obvious and identical, and it's just down to luck. The key crux IMO is the auction phase, which doesn't really seem to work due to low money (RhodesN7's review below was spot-on).  The conveyor belt aspect is OK, but a bit fiddly and becomes a chore as there's no interesting choices. I don't see the hardship cards as detrimental as Tom Vassel says in his review, but  it's one of the only key decisions and the game leader still has no choice!

However, I'd say the main flaw is there's no way for someone really to catch the leader without either forgoing one's own tableau (the rich just get richer) or using the hardship cards - and these are random.  Yes, there's a couple of 'attack'-type gear cards which could appear (if bought), but the gear cards are static and don't cycle during the game, and anyway this just means you sacrifice your own chances by wasting money or buying stuff you don't need solely to block the leader.

I think the auction stage needs fixing - it's the only part to really impact gameplay and the prices need revising. Why buy a personnel card which could protect from a potential hardship (if it appears in play) but does nothing else?  It just sits there all game.

I would have players start with more cash ($11 or $12k), equipment cards cost +$1k more than their list, gold nuggets sell for +$1k more (possibly with cash being included in final scoring, maybe $5k=1 nugget), and all gear sell for -$1k.  As well, one gear card and two auction cards (head-miner's choice of categories)  are discarded after each round, with new ones drawn. Possibly stale cards could get bundled with new auction cards.

This game is a poster child for the type of euro that no longer inspires me to play again. I get that euros have arbitrary limitations placed on them but I found them particularly unthematic and unintuitive here. 

First, I’ll mention what the game gets right. I like the way you have to dig and transport your dirt across different stages and that your machinery suffers wear and tear. I like that machinery comes in good and poor quality and that you can buy a piece of equipment simply to strip it for parts. All that makes sense and is rendered thematically well in the game.

On the downside, I was particularly annoyed with the way the auction mechanism means you might have all the money you need while your opponents are poor yet you aren’t allowed to buy what you want. This situation is more happenstance than player created and just feels arbitrary. This is the innovation of the game?

The Camp/Claim gear should be a tempting choice for spending workers and money on as a mid-turn boost but few cards get bought each game due to how uninteresting they are. For example, pay $3 to turn in a tile and possibly draw the same kind again. These should be boosted such that they’re constantly tempting you to skip the auction or otherwise spend your money on some short-term boosts. I think this is a real missed opportunity to add another dimension to the game. 

The way the hardship cards work in reverse gold nugget quantity order means that during the first 2/3 of the game when you’re selling your gold for much needed cash, you simply have to sell your gold on the same turn that you get it. You can’t sit there with a pile of nuggets and be the easy target for going last in the hardship card selection; those things are nasty. 

And they are nasty. An opponent bought a worker and then had to “lend” him to me for a turn (um, thematic?). That's the limit of interaction in the game because 98% of your worker placements happen on your own board and you have to watch each other to make sure you don’t do anything incorrect or forget to place machinery damage cubes when you should. I hate when games put the onus on players like that. I think I honestly forgot to place one damage cube in my game (sorry!). 

What you’re left with is a game of arbitrary auction blocking, then multiplayer solitaire, then some catch up in the form of take-that cards. You do this repeatedly each turn with no feeling of an arc or progression from weaker to more powerful cards/tiles. I just found it all uninspiring and too long for the depth of decisions or innovations.

Game is actually pretty strongly infused with theme with respect to gold mining. Players have to use their workers to pull "pay dirt" along their processing equipment while also adding wear tokens to their equipment as it is used, forcing them to either buy new equipment or use workers to msintain the equipment. Players purchase new claims, hire personnel, and purchase new equipment via an auction-and this is probably where the meat of the decision making lies...both in how to value items and determing what route you are going to take for processing.

The next stage is somewhat puzzlely as you simultaneously work at deciding how to best place your workers to achieve your ends.

Following this is perhaps the part of the game that will likely prove to be most determinative in people's opinions of the game - choosing the hardship cards. I find it interesting and challenging to work with these and it realky helps to keep the game interesting, thematic, and from feeling to samey. That said, it will likely greatly affect how the game goes for people, as some cards are unqusetionably much worse than others. Some describe it as a catch up mechanism, but depending when cards come out will make the effect much worse...i.e. Bad cards early in the game is much worse since it hurts you more while letting your oppnents move further ahead...later in the game you often have the resources to better deal with many of them.

I would put the game just past gateway game level...it's not difficult, but timing is absolutely critical in the game as well...you don't want to produce too much gold you can't sell early in the game or you get hit by the worst hardship cards...but at some point you need to start saving those same nuggets for points. I need to play this a few more times to decide what I realky think about this game:)...we'll see if my game group will play along:)

Looking forward to this. An auction game for down to 2 players, engine-building, beauuutiful art, and a novel theme. I'm all ears! (Sharing rahdo's excitement.)

Update: I have two issues with this game. First and foremost, the Personnel cards, Gear tiles, and Hardship cards have a lot of text on them. Especially the Gear tiles are pretty much impossible to make out across the table. I really, really, [i]really[/i] think some iconography would have done wonders here! Secondly, I think the semi-simultaneous nature of the Work Phase is just plain weird. The Gear shop is the culprit here. It would probably have worked much better if players first decided on how many workers to assign to the shop and then each carried out their work phases. Still, it feels really weird and messy. 

Overall verdict: I'd play it again, but I am very open to house rules. Based on the current gaming experiences I should have saved my money for game. I regret not following my gut feeling and cancelling my KS pledge before the game was shipped.

A charming surprise, this played a lot more interesting that I had innitially anticipated. All about auctioning for combos via personel and machinary, trying to find the right balance between gold nuggets (VP) and economy (money for auctions).

老實說遊戲多了就很容易忽略許多令人為之一亮的作品，Pay Dirt 掏金狂潮 也是其中一款，背景是19世紀掏金熱的年代，玩家頂著酷寒的天氣前往阿拉斯加掏金一搏，除了工具、機械的講究，藏金的開發地也是玩家必須爭奪的部分。
Pay Dirt 是以競標為主軸的工人行動點分配遊戲，遊戲中處處顯見作者對掏金作業的深入體會，每回合玩家必須選擇機具、專業人才、開發地權利來競標，再分配自己的工人逕行各項掏金作業，機具的耗用、惡劣天氣的不確定因素、以及掏到金塊的隨機性，都是遊戲中讓玩家思考如何安排行動的策略要素，真的非常有掏金夢難圓的感覺，雖然說不上需要長策的思考，遊戲卻總是充滿挑戰，基本上當最後的掏洗作業得到那亮金金的金塊時，心裡總是想著下一次要掏的更多，我想這也是與現實上許多掏金客趨之若鶩的主要原因吧~~~~

After the 2nd play, I really enjoyed this game. The theme (even though it's not my favorite) is actually really fun and very well executed. It's a bit cut throat, but I found that to be a nice change of pace.

I've read and/or heard complaints about money shortage, lack of player interaction, and hardship cards being too...well, hard. Money shortage and lack of player interaction is true when people don't understand the game. You can't be afraid to sell your gold; if you don't sell, it will be a boring grind of a game. You have to sell to give you more options, which allows you to interact more with players through the auction. Also, since selling means you'll usually have less gold, your opponent(s) will most likely be tempted to sell as well, since the player with the least gold gets to draw the hardship cards. So, that kind of balances itself a bit, which is really nice. Hardship cards ARE hard; that's the point.

It is a little luck driven, so be aware. The engine building is not super deep, but the depth is in the tactics/strategy of what to buy (keeping your opposition in mind) and when/how much to sell. The length is nice; if it was longer, you'd be a little bored with the engine building, as it starts to plateau toward the very end.

All in all, I think it's a great game. Very different from Alien Frontiers (my favorite game), but very well done.

...and man are the components nice! Also, rules were pretty clear, no complaints there.

Engine-building game about making money in the frozen Alaskan mining dirt.  Kind of worker placement, but without the limited spaces, and doesn't have the "A.P." (Analysis Paralysis) happen like other heavier W.P. games, and people seem to catch on by round two.  Turns are played simultaneously well, so there's not much downtime.  Not such a harsh penalizing with a single mistake, putting you out of the game.  So would be a good introductory game for newer players, a stepping stone to heavier euros.

As of KS update #35 shipping is expected to be complete Dec 17, so it's just a matter of how long it takes to arrive after that. Games were due to arrive @Essen for distribution in EU from Dec 29. However, it looks as though there's about a week's delay added to this, because these were timings based on update #34.

I really want to like this game, but many aspects of it can feel like work. People have to be really involved in the bidding phase to make this game stand out. Otherwise, it becomes a mundane worker placement with an annoying conveyor belt mechanic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I'm not sure I can call this a bad or a good game. I'm not sure if I want to like it more than I actually enjoy it...

The secret about Pay Dirt is that it is actually a bidding game hidden under a worker placement veneer. You have to know that before getting into it and have all your players understand the importance of the bidding phase.

The things I dont like is the actual worker placement phase. Pushing the tiles on the converoy belt actually feels like work... I guess its thematic in that sense?

Another quirk are the tools you purchase on the market. Most of them have special rules and very small and hard to read text on them, which can detract from the flow of the game.

I think this game would shine if you play with the same group over several sessions. Then it would shine as a very strategic, cutthroat experience with allot of tension and drama during the bidding phases.

Cool Worker-Placement Auction Game about Modern-Day Gold Digging in Alaska! By Tory Niemann and Crash Games.

Slight learning curve with getting used to how the workers properly use the equipment to process the "pay dirt". Pay Dirt has simultaneous worker placement and worker resolution phases of the game, which help speed up the playing time. The ground temperature drops are the timer for the game ending.

RATING: 8
In this game, you're operating a modern-day gold mine. You have three pieces of equipment, each with 3 slots, and you have to move dirt from your claims over those 9 slots conveyor belt-style in order to flip it over and see how much gold you get. You have a number of workers that you can use to advance the dirt or repair the equipment once you've used them too much. Each turn, you'll auction off new equipment (that might have fewer slots to move things along quicker, or maybe more durability), new workers (that might also have special abilities), and new claims with various qualities of dirt. Additionally, you'll have to deal with a hardship each turn, which are drafted in reverse-winning order. This was my favorite game of the con, I loved planning out my moves and dealing with the unexpected.

The gold mining life ain't easy, and Pay Dirt seems to accurately capture that theme. Pushing dirt across my tableau really did feel like a chore, and repairing broken down machines or replacing them every other round sure was discouraging. It seems like a house rule or two could make this game shine. My biggest concern is the the flow of money and auctioning. No one had enough money for competitive bidding, and I'm not sure they would've paid all that much even if they did. The equipment just didn't seem worth the cost when one gold nugget equaled so little money. There also needs to be a mechanic to discard or incentivize cards that don't get bought, otherwise they just sit around and bog down the game.

RATING: 6.7
Dig up gold, move it, clean it, sell it for money or keep it as points. Use money to bid for new tools and work force to get more efficient in getting that gold... There's been many mining games and usually the main idea is the same, and this one follows that line as well. Yet, all of them go at it slightly different.
I enjoy engine building/optimization games and this one works fine. I enjoyed playing it. I only have one complaint: some of those damned event cards are very tough and while you can take some measures to avoid them you can't stop all of them and I can imagine some of them might be pretty detrimental. I had the chance of shoving a really annoying one to the main competitor for the win, and it bogged his last turn down quite a bit and I won. I don't think it would have mattered in this case, but if the game was closer, it could have.

Very pleasantly surprised by this one! Component quality is through the ROOF. Crazy good. Same for the art.
The game is really thematic (an original theme to boot!) and the mechanics are simple and tied to the theme perfectly.
This is a mid-weight resource management, engine building Euro with a fantastic auction mechanic (even for 2 players!) It's not so complex that it gets too mathy, but it does have more than enough depth for fans of strategic thinking. 
Hardcore Euro fans may not like the randomness of the hardship cards, but I think they add exactly what most Euros need: FUN!

Just a few plays in so far, found out I was doing the auction phase wrong also.

Really liking the game though, it's pretty easy to learn and explain.  This means that there isn't a ton of depth to it, but it plays very quickly and is entertaining throughout.  I love the randomness of the gold unveils, just a fun little thing while you're playing that can make you sulk or cheer every time you uncover that deposit.

I tend to have difficulty enjoying Engine Building games, but this one isn't as dull since everyone runs their engine independently and there is heavy interaction through the auction phase and hardships.

Few small gripes, pitfall of running an engine by yourself, people can be accidentally cheating if they misunderstand how something works and no one is watching them.  Happened a few times.  There are a few brutal hardships.

RATING: 5
basic engine building game, but really short, so you can not spend much time building a perfect engine; + to get better stuff, you must waste actions & gold (which are VP); it's an OK game.

[+] short (~7 turns), tight action & resource management, I like the equipment getting damaged over time; 
[-] theme and artwork don't appeal to me; hardship cards are unbalanced (it's the point I guess, it's the catch-up mechanic) and random nugget count on tiles can swing the game; mechanically, nothing that really stands out; don't like the bidding phase, would prefer if everyone simply got to buy something in turn order

If you are either A) a huge fan of the various "exotic job" reality shows or B) a direct descendent of James W. Marshall, you will probably love this game. It does a fair job of recreating the vibe of a start-up mining company and the bits are top notch. Colorful heavy duty tiles and big ole' golden nuggets make for one heck of a nice looking game on the table. I had high hopes going in.

The game plays fine. There aren't any game breaking flaws or critical missteps. But there are a couple of niggles that just rub me (and my group, for that matter) the wrong way.

First off, the separate worker assignments seem like a completely unnecessary exercise. All of the dirt you are mining only moves one direction on what is functionally a conveyor belt. Workers you place on each section can only pull dirt towards them from section to section, or move it along in the one section where they are residing. This means you have to work out backwards, the order in which you need to place the workers, in order to slide all the dirt. It's surprisingly easy to make a mistake here, but I'm not sure this little logistical skill test adds anything to the game other than frustration. If there were interrupts, direct interaction or programming variables in this phase of the game, it might make sense. But there is not. It feels like an unnecessary complication put into the game to make it feel heavier than it actually is.

If I were keeping this game, I would absolutely house rule that you can just use your workers, as needed, one at a time out of a single worker pool. This is a zero interaction part of the game, so how can it even matter?

My second issue is one that seems to be a problem for a great many speculation games. Whether it is oil, gold, lost artifacts or any other "strike it rich" trope you can think of. Namely, how do you provide the thrill of a lucky strike without also producing a runaway leader? Most of the games of this nature I've played recently, including this one, solve it by evening out the spread of payouts, among the different strata of potential strikes. So a low yield spot may yield 2-4 units and a high yield space 3-6 or something of that nature. It certainly works, but I have to say it completely removes any thrill of pulling a golden ticket when a big strike is only a unit or two more than the run of the mill results.

Thebes is the only game that gets this right I think, so I will be going back to that and moving this guy right along.

I need to play this one again.  There are some very thematic things going on here, and I like it.  But, I'm not quite sure how much effect anything that you do really has.

Optimizing your engine to mine gold in Alaska before the ground freezes. The actions are very consistent with the theme.  I like that our miners start with a shoddy engine that needs a lot of TLC with choices on how to optimize.  The bid phase for the best labor, equipment, and mine claims is a perfect way to simulate the competitive demand for limited resources. Simultaneous worker placement to speed along play. Love the end of dirt processing reveal of the random odds gold content.  And I'm glad that they incorporate wear and tear on equipment. Drive this all home with a hardship phase to drag down runaway leaders. How great is it that you sell your victory point gold to manage and upgrade your mine--love it.  This game is thoroughly well thought out and plays intuitively.  Almost could be a gateway game.  I feel qualified to endorse this game as an employee of an Alaskan mining and natural resources company.

PnP version. This seems like a good game with plenty going on. A little more player interaction is what is missing. I look forward to the finished product.

VERY good game.  A simple but deceptively strategic auction is the root of it and production values and theme are through the roof.  Cousin to Fleet.  Gold Rush, the game.  Gold tiles are a bit too fiddly.  Bag draw better?

I'm absolutely in love with Pay Dirt's theme, it appeals to me as a huge fan of the Gold Rush TV show. I dug into the VASSAL module to test the game, to see if I should back the game on Kickstarter or not. Bear this in mind, I have not played this face to face, and in my experience that is always the best way to enjoy a board game.

However, there are a number of things that concern me:

[b]First[/b], it is odd how you cannot increase the production of pay dirt by using two excavators, or getting more pay dirt into your wash plant by using more than one loader, or processing more pay dirt by having one wash plant per claim. Instead you keep upgrading your 1 piece of each equipment during the short Alaskan gold mining season, instead  of also using the old model as long as it holds up if you have the crew to operate it.

[b]Second[/b], for some reason I can only have one piece of Camp Gear, and one piece of Claim Gear each. This not only leads to fewer options of fun combos of game powers, but it's just plain odd. If I have a Shake Table, then I cannot have a Sluice Box, why? If I have a Ripper Attachment, then I cannot also have an Industrial Pump, again, why the heck not?

[b]Third[/b], the auction phase also irks me. We're bidding on Equipment (which in this game is Excavators, Loaders, and Wash Plants), Personnel, and Claims, but for some reason Gear can be had at set prices and include huge equipment like bulldozers. Also, you are many times better off not even starting a bid if you have much less cash than your opponent, as you will just help them improve their mining camp. I also wonder why I would not have my personnel and claim sorted out prior to starting my first mining season? I do love that Equipment can be scrapped for parts, if you win an auction and don't need it, but as outlined in my first issue, I would prefer to be able to use multiple pieces of equipment, or perhaps scrap my old piece of Equipment for parts (how about at least letting me spread the wear cubes across both?).

[b]Fourth[/b], I don't think it works well as a 2-player game. The first player is at a severe disadvantage apart from being able to buy a choice piece of gear the first round, but be wary to be the first player to produce gold (see my next point).

[b]Fifth[/b], the Hardship Cards. Ugh, there's this weird take-that aspect to the Hardship Phase. Yes, it's a catch-up mechanism, but with the right Hardship Cards you can cripple your opponents, it doesn't pay to be first to strike gold, and being the first player at the start of the game is a severe disadvantage.

[b]Sixth[/b], why are we collecting nuggets, and not weight measurements of gold? How about measuring our success in ounces or grams of gold instead?

[b]Seventh[/b], what does the Income Phase signify? Why do I get $2,000 at the end of each round, and what's a round? I feel like it would've been more fun if the game simply had increased the value of each Gold Nugget to $4,000 and therefore the incentive to sell some of your hard earned gold, and then skip the Income Phase entirely.

[b]Eighth,[/b] why doesn't the game's Claim and Camp Gear Tiles come with unique artwork? Yes it would increase production costs, I understand that, but it would've made a great stretch goal during the Kickstarter campaign. The same applies to the game's Hardship Cards. They force players to constantly scan and read the cards, they must learn what the titles represent, instead of recognizing the image of a bulldozer at a glance from across the table, now you have 4 players leaning in to see what each Gear Tile represents.

[b]Ninth[/b], I simply don't like games where I use single sided cardboard tiles to determine random value. The small Pay Dirt Tiles are likely to get scuffed or marked and thus kill the suspense of their hidden values. Trying to randomize returned tiles is also a pain, especially as their actual value must stay hidden even from the person pulling the tile. I would much rather push around some good looking wooden bits, and then roll one of three different d3s (for Barren, Promising, and Rich dirt) to determine the Pay Dirt's final value (and I'm aware that this doesn't work with some of the abilities in the game, which allow peeking at the Pay Dirt Tile's value).

[b]Tenth[/b], this is my final point of criticism, it feels a tad under-developed. Half-baked. I feel like with more development and play testing this could be simply amazing, but (and [i]this is a big point to be clear about[/i]) this is simply about the game not meeting my hopes. I wish this was a much heavier game, with more depth. A game as ruthless as Pret-a-Porter in simulating running a business. I wish I could find investors, take out loans, have multiple crews working different claims, use multiple pieces of equipment, and especially play more than a single season.

[b]Lastly the things I do like[/b], and there are many:

1) The theme rocks! It's one of the most intriguing ones I've seen in ages.

2)  As pointed out previously, I like how I can scrap newly purchased equipment for parts (still odd though, that the reverse isn't true).

3) FlimCo Equipment is awesome in how it works, and how you must be careful to manage it's wear.

4) Trying to come up with cool combos of Gear and Workers.

5) The process of moving Pay Dirt is fun and thematic.

6) It looks good. The artwork fits the theme (even though there could be more of it, as pointed out above).

This is not a very complex game, and feels in line with similar eurogames about the weight of Stone Age, and Fresco. I think it will appeal to a wide bunch of gamers, including casual players, and will make a terrific family game. It is sadly not a game I'd like at this point, hopefully it will fund and see a few expansions over the next couple of years, and I'll be back digging up Pay Dirt.

Kickstarter edition. Comes with the 3 mini expansions

Unusual, prospecty (as one would hope), and fun. There's a lot of speculative management with greatly mitigated risks.  Art's rather nice, but I would rather prefer the text be more visible for players that are not right in front of it. Good game!
